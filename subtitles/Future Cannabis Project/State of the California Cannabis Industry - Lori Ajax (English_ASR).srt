[Music]

2
00:00:10,699 --> 00:00:17,070
we sound on a survey to licensed

3
00:00:13,798 --> 00:00:18,660
operators all across the supply chain we

4
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:21,600
asked and feedback on specific questions

5
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:23,698
we asked for their comments and we

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,820
largely based all of those replies that

7
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:29,849
we received and put them into these

8
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:33,000
questions and then you know there's

9
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:35,789
about 15 questions that we sort of got

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,799
in mind from from that if we have time

11
00:00:35,789 --> 00:00:40,950
we'll definitely you know do some QA if

12
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:42,539
we can but they're pretty dense and

13
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:44,579
meaty subjects so I think we can just

14
00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:45,058
like go through and have a good time

15
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:48,960
with it

16
00:00:45,058 --> 00:00:50,599
okay everyone cool all right that's how

17
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,698
we're gonna do it but first all right so

18
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:56,698
Laurie thank you for being here it's

19
00:00:53,698 --> 00:00:58,049
really a pleasure to have you here I

20
00:00:56,698 --> 00:01:01,140
don't know if everyone knows but Laurie

21
00:00:58,049 --> 00:01:03,299
his husband I had a huge milestone

22
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:07,079
yesterday and it was huge celebration

23
00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:08,728
and she drove up for this event while

24
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:10,618
something is going on with family and

25
00:01:08,728 --> 00:01:12,719
everything it's great thank you for

26
00:01:10,618 --> 00:01:15,030
doing that you're welcome thank you for

27
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:18,810
having me yeah it means a lot we're like

28
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:20,400
come on Laurie please say yes so last

29
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:22,379
time we were here we were in the

30
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,930
amphitheater over there right I don't

31
00:01:22,379 --> 00:01:27,408
know if everyone remembers and I kind of

32
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:29,729
wanted to just take a moment and retrace

33
00:01:27,409 --> 00:01:31,650
what we've been through in the last year

34
00:01:29,728 --> 00:01:35,188
and I think you guys are all gonna get a

35
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:38,609
kick out of it so right after we left

36
00:01:35,188 --> 00:01:40,798
last year we had July 1 and if everyone

37
00:01:38,609 --> 00:01:42,359
remembers July 1 there was lab testing

38
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,670
and packaging requirements and the

39
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:47,780
destruction of products that wasn't

40
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:50,700
really fun we had emergency regulations

41
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:53,759
number two and then public comment

42
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:56,430
period we had the regulations when we

43
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,319
submitted it to the O AO and waiting in

44
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:01,380
that that time frame

45
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:05,489
we had in parallel temporary application

46
00:02:01,379 --> 00:02:07,949
process and annual application process

47
00:02:05,489 --> 00:02:10,909
and then you had a trickling of

48
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:13,500
Provisionals that went out

49
00:02:10,909 --> 00:02:15,359
temps you extended but

50
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,659
we had to legislate to get permission to

51
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:22,140
provide extensions while processing

52
00:02:17,659 --> 00:02:24,109
applications or not and I don't know if

53
00:02:22,139 --> 00:02:27,179
anyone knows this but Lori's team

54
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:28,740
definitely in in December her she I

55
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:31,620
remember you saying on stage you're like

56
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:34,110
we will process every single application

57
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:35,849
and you guys did you were working

58
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:37,620
through the holidays you were working

59
00:02:35,849 --> 00:02:39,719
weekends you were working nights your

60
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:41,819
entire team and you finish the entire

61
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:44,340
queue which I thought was really

62
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:44,729
admirable amazing so thank you for doing

63
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:48,360
that

64
00:02:44,729 --> 00:02:50,579
then it brings us to 2019 where the

65
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,560
writing on the wall that CD CD F a and

66
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:58,950
CD pH weren't actually allowed to give

67
00:02:52,560 --> 00:03:01,830
extensions yeah and then that led us to

68
00:02:58,949 --> 00:03:05,579
a round of licensing attrition from

69
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:09,180
temporaries to nothing or temporaries to

70
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:11,040
Provisionals and enables then we have

71
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:14,099
the new legislation that's being pushed

72
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:15,689
around sampling white labeling non

73
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:19,019
licensing all this other stuff that

74
00:03:15,689 --> 00:03:21,659
that's going through and then about like

75
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:25,709
last month your the agency BC seats are

76
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:27,329
pushing out Provisionals and then oh and

77
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:29,310
also the 10 million dollar equity grant

78
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:33,180
money was announced on a registration

79
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:35,340
process but then put on hold right guys

80
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:39,980
that was just like a high level of last

81
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:44,310
year I mean does it feel like oh my god

82
00:03:39,979 --> 00:03:45,899
it's crazy but we've had a lot of wins

83
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:47,449
and this is why well and these come

84
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:49,709
directly from the survey responses

85
00:03:47,449 --> 00:03:53,879
cannabis is legal people are not going

86
00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:57,329
to jail right amazing we have clean

87
00:03:53,879 --> 00:04:00,479
medicine maybe a little too clean but uh

88
00:03:57,329 --> 00:04:03,030
a little too clean I think the metals

89
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:05,909
may be a little bit we could accept a

90
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:08,099
little bit more metals deliveries are

91
00:04:05,909 --> 00:04:10,409
allowed everywhere so we're not

92
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:12,359
restricting access to California's in

93
00:04:10,409 --> 00:04:16,379
local governments who enacted a ban

94
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:18,449
which is huge and I credit to your a

95
00:04:16,379 --> 00:04:21,120
group you've advocated for that you

96
00:04:18,449 --> 00:04:22,769
stood for that and without your support

97
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:27,829
in your fight I I doubt we would have

98
00:04:22,769 --> 00:04:27,829
had statewide delivery so kudos to that

99
00:04:28,209 --> 00:04:31,939
issuing temp licenses thank you for

100
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,589
extending it and giving people time to

101
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:35,449
catch up

102
00:04:33,589 --> 00:04:37,638
transparency for the consumer

103
00:04:35,449 --> 00:04:40,639
what's interesting social equity is more

104
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:43,160
of a focus than ever from last year this

105
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:46,730
year that is a driving point and many of

106
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:48,950
the conversations we're having after

107
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:51,379
some setbacks the the compassion program

108
00:04:48,949 --> 00:04:55,209
is being reconsidered so that's great

109
00:04:51,379 --> 00:04:57,680
too for compassion thank you for that

110
00:04:55,209 --> 00:05:00,469
event licensing we were having more

111
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:12,040
events provisional licensing and just in

112
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:12,040
time for Meadowlands the QA database I

113
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:19,010
mean that it's phenomenal thank you for

114
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:21,319
doing that I mean I can't tell you how

115
00:05:19,009 --> 00:05:23,449
many questions that we all I mean even

116
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:25,159
this weekend share and to have a

117
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:27,860
legitimate source that's saying hey this

118
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:30,590
is the answer no misinformation we can

119
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:37,310
go to helps a lot so thank you for

120
00:05:30,589 --> 00:05:39,319
making that happen my team did a great

121
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:41,720
job and we're just gonna keep adding to

122
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:43,819
it by the way and these are a lot of the

123
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:45,979
questions that we're answering by email

124
00:05:43,819 --> 00:05:47,149
and instead of just going to one person

125
00:05:45,978 --> 00:05:50,529
we're just gonna share it all with you

126
00:05:47,149 --> 00:05:53,239
folks I think it's gonna be helpful yes

127
00:05:50,529 --> 00:05:56,599
yes for the consultants that make money

128
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:58,519
on just that piece you know sorry but

129
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:00,979
let's let's tackle some other things and

130
00:05:58,519 --> 00:06:03,109
help us help each other out all right so

131
00:06:00,978 --> 00:06:05,389
that was like boy I mean that's a lot

132
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:08,990
right any thoughts on the winds or the

133
00:06:05,389 --> 00:06:11,329
past it's it's been brutal that's what I

134
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:16,430
for you guys too right I mean like the

135
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:18,139
last year 2018 is like a blur and I you

136
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:20,900
know I almost forget some of the things

137
00:06:18,139 --> 00:06:22,969
until you mention them and I I will say

138
00:06:20,899 --> 00:06:26,120
this what a lot of you don't know either

139
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:28,100
is that the first four month of 2019 we

140
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:30,709
were statutorily mandated to have a

141
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:32,600
Department of Finance audit so for four

142
00:06:30,709 --> 00:06:36,649
months we had about eight auditors

143
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:38,689
looking at everything so that'll be

144
00:06:36,649 --> 00:06:40,158
coming out on July 1st they have to

145
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:40,728
report it to the legislature so it's

146
00:06:40,158 --> 00:06:43,519
something you might

147
00:06:40,728 --> 00:06:46,158
want to keep an eye out for Wow so you

148
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:48,318
go through audits - it's like a report

149
00:06:46,158 --> 00:06:51,050
card you guys got me I was on your

150
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:54,229
report card I'm like oh no and then yeah

151
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:55,668
everybody's Wow yeah it's pretty

152
00:06:54,228 --> 00:06:57,498
incredible a cat Packer was here

153
00:06:55,668 --> 00:06:59,028
yesterday and she's like at least we

154
00:06:57,499 --> 00:07:01,939
don't have to go through everything that

155
00:06:59,028 --> 00:07:03,439
we just went through again and if

156
00:07:01,939 --> 00:07:05,059
anything everything that we did go

157
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:07,370
through hopefully has made us more

158
00:07:05,059 --> 00:07:08,900
resilient and knowledgeable about the

159
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:10,550
process and kind of what we need to do

160
00:07:08,899 --> 00:07:13,638
to kind of continue to navigate and move

161
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:16,939
ahead all right so let's let's dive in

162
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:19,158
here so the journey is largely focused

163
00:07:16,939 --> 00:07:20,778
on creating a successful regulated

164
00:07:19,158 --> 00:07:23,389
supply chain for the largest cannabis

165
00:07:20,778 --> 00:07:24,949
market in the world it's a tough job in

166
00:07:23,389 --> 00:07:27,860
the last year we've taken both steps

167
00:07:24,949 --> 00:07:29,569
forward and backward what do you need in

168
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:34,180
terms of support to realize your vision

169
00:07:29,569 --> 00:07:34,180
of a successful supply chain currently

170
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:42,198
so I think that when we talk about big

171
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:43,579
businesses middle medium-sized small

172
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:46,088
businesses we want a little bit of

173
00:07:43,579 --> 00:07:48,438
everything right you want a balance and

174
00:07:46,088 --> 00:07:50,240
one of the things in the statute when

175
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:52,430
you have a full vertical integration it

176
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,319
does make it difficult to strike that

177
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:56,180
balance because you know the big guys

178
00:07:54,319 --> 00:08:00,319
can hold every license so can the small

179
00:07:56,180 --> 00:08:02,899
guys so that gets it gets tough but I

180
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,749
think as for the state of California we

181
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:06,949
really start have to look at the small

182
00:08:04,749 --> 00:08:08,659
businesses and how do we make you know

183
00:08:06,949 --> 00:08:10,550
the new business is coming up how do we

184
00:08:08,658 --> 00:08:12,740
make them successful and I don't know

185
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:16,668
that we've struck that balance yet I

186
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:19,309
think our regulations are are hard for

187
00:08:16,668 --> 00:08:21,649
new businesses starting out and of

188
00:08:19,309 --> 00:08:24,110
course when I say what kind of support

189
00:08:21,649 --> 00:08:27,168
we need well and I think for one thing

190
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:29,629
you guys are a big voice and that is we

191
00:08:27,168 --> 00:08:31,698
need more enforcement on the unlicensed

192
00:08:29,629 --> 00:08:33,680
market we can't ever expect you to make

193
00:08:31,699 --> 00:08:35,810
it if you're going to continue to

194
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:38,379
compete in this market with an

195
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:41,328
unregulated unlicensed market that

196
00:08:38,379 --> 00:08:43,099
frankly there's a lot of you know some

197
00:08:41,328 --> 00:08:44,778
of them are trying to get a license but

198
00:08:43,099 --> 00:08:46,850
there's a good chunk of them that have

199
00:08:44,778 --> 00:08:48,500
no intention of getting a license

200
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:50,120
they're almost saying hey we're just

201
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:53,958
gonna wait til somebody says something

202
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:54,620
or do something and so for for us at the

203
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:57,289
bureau

204
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:59,720
I talked with my staff I mean I say this

205
00:08:57,289 --> 00:09:02,750
and I don't take it lightly it is a

206
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:06,019
fight every single day but I see the

207
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:08,990
industry your voice I think means a lot

208
00:09:06,019 --> 00:09:11,720
and to continue to say hey we need more

209
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:13,580
enforcement we need more to go out and

210
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:15,830
make sure that we can compete in this

211
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:20,080
market so I think enforcement is a is a

212
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:22,820
big deal and it touches so many of us so

213
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,860
I'm hoping over this and I just want to

214
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:27,590
crush the illegal market and I don't

215
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:29,570
usually say that out loud but I feel the

216
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:32,300
same way you do because we didn't work

217
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:35,510
go through all this for the last few

218
00:09:32,299 --> 00:09:37,339
years to have this market be undermined

219
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:40,850
for people that don't want to get in the

220
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:43,730
licensed market so we feel it personal -

221
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:47,810
because you don't want to sacrifice

222
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:49,879
always sacrifice to see basically people

223
00:09:47,809 --> 00:09:51,739
just say well we're not going to get

224
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:53,450
involved we're just gonna you know not

225
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:55,100
get licensed it's not fair to all of you

226
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:59,090
here that our license paying all your

227
00:09:55,100 --> 00:10:01,129
fees and taxes so yeah so you know to

228
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:03,980
summarize more like having an ability

229
00:10:01,129 --> 00:10:05,659
for small businesses to compete and you

230
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:07,580
know going after enforcement in a way

231
00:10:05,659 --> 00:10:09,169
where the illicit market you know does

232
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:11,960
not exist and we can continue to thrive

233
00:10:09,169 --> 00:10:14,149
yeah and one more thing I had a

234
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:16,670
conversation I don't know Maya's he or

235
00:10:14,149 --> 00:10:20,360
she was a perfect example she asked me a

236
00:10:16,669 --> 00:10:23,449
question and she is a manufacturer and

237
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:25,820
the hardest thing for us like when Alex

238
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:27,620
and Andre from my team is here when

239
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:29,330
people come to me and say hey you know

240
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:31,190
something happened we had two real able

241
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:32,780
all our product it would be nice if we

242
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:35,180
could do something a different way and I

243
00:10:32,779 --> 00:10:37,309
have to say well we don't regulate the

244
00:10:35,179 --> 00:10:39,799
manufacturers at the BCC you have to go

245
00:10:37,309 --> 00:10:41,569
to another agency that's really hard to

246
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:43,459
do and you have to deal with three

247
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:45,500
different licensing agency and that's

248
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:48,740
not including all the other agencies and

249
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:51,649
so I want to solve problems but it's

250
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:53,210
hard when some problems that it's

251
00:10:51,649 --> 00:10:55,759
difficult to solve because it doesn't

252
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:57,500
fall under our Authority and so I think

253
00:10:55,759 --> 00:11:00,740
we need to find better ways to

254
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:04,519
collaborate with ourselves at the state

255
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:06,500
right and just make one agency and guys

256
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:09,199
on top of that can we yeah

257
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:11,299
can we do that I guess about the looking

258
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,850
tonight is that ballot I don't even know

259
00:11:11,299 --> 00:11:17,889
but like but what you're saying is that

260
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:20,029
there's just so much inter agency work

261
00:11:17,889 --> 00:11:23,000
make it through I think we gotta really

262
00:11:20,029 --> 00:11:25,549
think about that going forward and but I

263
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,950
I want to I'm committed to we gotta have

264
00:11:25,549 --> 00:11:30,169
better communication I'm gonna tell you

265
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:32,030
if sometimes it's hard for me to get an

266
00:11:30,169 --> 00:11:34,099
answer from other state agencies I can

267
00:11:32,029 --> 00:11:36,649
only imagine what it is for the industry

268
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:38,810
right and so so we've got to do better

269
00:11:36,649 --> 00:11:40,909
there and I think we're going to

270
00:11:38,809 --> 00:11:44,239
concentrate on that that we got to have

271
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:47,809
consistency between the agencies and be

272
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:50,299
responsive and I think you guys know we

273
00:11:47,809 --> 00:11:52,819
we want to hear from you we really do we

274
00:11:50,299 --> 00:11:54,439
want your feedback but we know there's I

275
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:56,390
mean you just mentioned it like lab

276
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:59,510
testing maybe we need to relax a little

277
00:11:56,389 --> 00:12:01,490
on the heavy metals I do think I think

278
00:11:59,509 --> 00:12:04,490
lab testing is very important I think we

279
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:06,139
all think that but where's where again

280
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:07,850
where's the balance and do we need to

281
00:12:06,139 --> 00:12:09,590
look at those things yeah I think what's

282
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:11,420
interesting and specifically the labs it

283
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:13,100
was you look at other states and their

284
00:12:11,419 --> 00:12:16,639
lab testing requirements California is

285
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:18,920
pretty stringent and when you're failing

286
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:21,830
on something where other states it's

287
00:12:18,919 --> 00:12:24,229
okay and you're failing by you know 0.1

288
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:26,690
or whatever it's it's detrimental to

289
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:30,649
these these operators it's a huge

290
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:32,630
setback so last year we asked you if you

291
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:35,209
had a Northstar metric and I think you

292
00:12:32,629 --> 00:12:37,220
are at the time just saying well there

293
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:40,100
is a lot of change it's very difficult

294
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:44,000
to have a Northstar metric processing as

295
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:46,670
many licenses was a metric currently is

296
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:51,440
there a Northstar metric for 2019 for

297
00:12:46,669 --> 00:12:53,629
the BCC well as you know we're our

298
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,970
metric is like the end of July right now

299
00:12:53,629 --> 00:12:58,669
we got it we have about 1800 temporaries

300
00:12:55,970 --> 00:13:00,290
that are expiring so and we're in a

301
00:12:58,669 --> 00:13:03,349
provisional yeah getting a provisional

302
00:13:00,289 --> 00:13:06,319
we don't want any gap in licensure I I

303
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:08,810
am my my staff understands I don't want

304
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,400
anybody expiring nobody's expiring we

305
00:13:08,809 --> 00:13:12,049
got to get you in a provisional and if

306
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:14,509
that means we got to call you on Sunday

307
00:13:12,049 --> 00:13:16,879
morning we're hoping we're calling you

308
00:13:14,509 --> 00:13:20,139
on Sunday morning do it can you make

309
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:22,570
that happen for CDFA and NCD pH

310
00:13:20,139 --> 00:13:26,528
I mean I just wish that was shared

311
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:29,410
across all agencies well yeah so that's

312
00:13:26,528 --> 00:13:31,600
a short-term metric but just but that is

313
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:33,189
the direction we say I don't I mean I

314
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,980
don't want anybody slipping through the

315
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:38,079
cracks but we also don't want you

316
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:39,820
staying in a provisional we want to get

317
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:41,739
those annuals out and I think that's

318
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:44,050
important for a lot of you I don't like

319
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:45,730
the word temporary or provisional I like

320
00:13:44,049 --> 00:13:47,109
the word annual because that means

321
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:50,259
you're here to stay

322
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:52,089
and so that's that's a big I mean

323
00:13:50,259 --> 00:13:55,389
obviously still going you know working

324
00:13:52,089 --> 00:13:57,070
on that enforcement and then just so you

325
00:13:55,389 --> 00:13:59,889
know we're looking at where look we're

326
00:13:57,070 --> 00:14:03,160
already starting to rewrite some of our

327
00:13:59,889 --> 00:14:04,838
regulations where we have there's a lot

328
00:14:03,159 --> 00:14:05,828
of things we need to correct where

329
00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:08,769
there's a lot of things we need to

330
00:14:05,828 --> 00:14:10,479
clarify and so it's not this is no time

331
00:14:08,769 --> 00:14:14,049
to say hey you know you're stuck with

332
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:16,389
the regs I think if you have feedback if

333
00:14:14,049 --> 00:14:19,088
things that you think aren't working now

334
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:21,129
is the time to start telling us hey take

335
00:14:19,089 --> 00:14:23,440
a look at this or that and that's what

336
00:14:21,129 --> 00:14:25,240
we're doing right now and and depending

337
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,640
on what happens with legislation you're

338
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:29,470
probably going to see a regulation

339
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:31,179
package at least clean up and

340
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:34,120
clarification and new legislation

341
00:14:31,179 --> 00:14:34,569
towards the end of the year Wow you are

342
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:38,409
busy

343
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:39,790
I mean BCC is a really tough job I can

344
00:14:38,409 --> 00:14:41,889
only imagine what you and your

345
00:14:39,789 --> 00:14:43,929
department has to go through because not

346
00:14:41,889 --> 00:14:45,338
only processing applications going to

347
00:14:43,929 --> 00:14:48,129
these meetings talking to all these

348
00:14:45,339 --> 00:14:50,230
agencies you're hiring more staff you're

349
00:14:48,129 --> 00:14:52,208
integrating them into the process you're

350
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:55,120
talking to multiple stakeholders those

351
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:57,099
stakeholders often are changing too to

352
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,860
try to keep track of everyone you know

353
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:01,570
it can get I don't know it could get

354
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:03,129
easy just to just like alright maybe

355
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:05,589
this is too much you know what is

356
00:15:03,129 --> 00:15:07,480
motivating you to continue to show up at

357
00:15:05,589 --> 00:15:09,100
everything participate keep you know

358
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:11,320
pushing forward still having a positive

359
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:13,750
attitude about everything like you know

360
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:15,810
I'm just Curt you know curious about

361
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:20,470
that

362
00:15:15,809 --> 00:15:23,528
so there's many times when I it is

363
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:26,259
overwhelming and you do get down you see

364
00:15:23,528 --> 00:15:28,750
we see the struggles I think the hardest

365
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:31,350
part right now is because we do most of

366
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:33,429
my staff we take it personally and

367
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:36,519
normally when you're a regulated

368
00:15:33,429 --> 00:15:39,819
you don't get that kind of emotion but I

369
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:42,549
don't like to see people struggling to

370
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:45,430
just survive so I think what motivates

371
00:15:42,549 --> 00:15:47,529
me is I think there's three there's more

372
00:15:45,429 --> 00:15:49,239
we can do it's not enough that we I

373
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:51,129
think I've always said this is not

374
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:53,320
enough just to put in regulations and

375
00:15:51,129 --> 00:15:56,230
say oh we got our final regulations our

376
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:58,330
work is done I feel like I'm my work is

377
00:15:56,230 --> 00:16:00,940
quite not done I got to make things

378
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:03,129
better I got to leave it in a better

379
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:06,100
place for those who come after me and so

380
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:09,789
I I don't want to see so many people

381
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:11,320
hurting and painful because if anything

382
00:16:09,789 --> 00:16:14,019
you guys have taught me canvas isn't

383
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:19,420
supposed to be that and it shouldn't be

384
00:16:14,019 --> 00:16:21,669
that right absolutely yeah

385
00:16:19,419 --> 00:16:23,349
last November we elected governor Newsom

386
00:16:21,669 --> 00:16:26,620
who was part of the Blue Ribbon Campaign

387
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:28,509
on actually moving 64 Ford so he helped

388
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:30,220
design the framework and and you were

389
00:16:28,509 --> 00:16:33,399
tasked with implementing it and now he's

390
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:34,960
seeing that implementation process he is

391
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:37,120
you know been more aware of what's going

392
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:39,670
on the industry is more connected and is

393
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:41,860
also hired you know advisers like Nicole

394
00:16:39,669 --> 00:16:44,229
Elliot who was head of Austin camp in

395
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:45,879
San Francisco was here yesterday to his

396
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:47,320
administration and what's your

397
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:49,090
relationship with governor newsome's

398
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:50,620
office and how things change from

399
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:51,879
working with Governor Brown you know

400
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:53,560
what are their priorities and

401
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:58,870
specifically you know how does your

402
00:16:53,559 --> 00:17:00,909
mandate changed so I in governor

403
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:04,088
Newson's office has been actually really

404
00:17:00,909 --> 00:17:05,680
responsive they really understand the

405
00:17:04,088 --> 00:17:07,690
issues and I think a lot of that came

406
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:10,690
from him being so involved with the Blue

407
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:13,120
Ribbon Commission Nicole Elliot came on

408
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:15,490
just a few months ago and she's just hit

409
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:19,179
the ground running and she really has a

410
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:21,930
good overview of cannabis so it is nice

411
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:24,160
that we have somebody directly in the

412
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:27,039
administration that we can go to when we

413
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:29,590
do have issues that come up so for us

414
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:32,769
that's been a that's been huge for us so

415
00:17:29,589 --> 00:17:35,079
and we have a really good relationship

416
00:17:32,769 --> 00:17:37,269
with them so I'm really looking forward

417
00:17:35,079 --> 00:17:40,000
to the next year because I think

418
00:17:37,269 --> 00:17:41,769
together I mean it again there's so many

419
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,349
there's only so much the Bureau can do

420
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:46,119
so having someone like her on our side

421
00:17:44,349 --> 00:17:46,839
it really helps and the administration

422
00:17:46,119 --> 00:17:49,359
that actually won

423
00:17:46,839 --> 00:17:51,730
to move forward and push compassion and

424
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:54,459
all these always exactly exactly yeah I

425
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:57,298
think that's really a key so I'm gonna

426
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:59,590
have you play doctor from a moment so we

427
00:17:57,298 --> 00:18:02,319
as part of the survey collected data

428
00:17:59,589 --> 00:18:03,788
points and basically said it's to

429
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:07,480
measure the overall health and industry

430
00:18:03,788 --> 00:18:09,669
so we've got some vitals here and based

431
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:11,380
off of these vitals love to give you

432
00:18:09,669 --> 00:18:14,860
know your thoughts on the diagnosis of

433
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:17,159
it so we had five questions here and

434
00:18:14,859 --> 00:18:22,808
they go from the scale of one to five

435
00:18:17,159 --> 00:18:25,090
one poor five great how would you rate

436
00:18:22,808 --> 00:18:27,460
the transition and and so these people

437
00:18:25,089 --> 00:18:28,928
just marked off between one to five how

438
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:33,880
would you rate the transition to current

439
00:18:28,929 --> 00:18:35,350
regs two-thirds rated it one or two how

440
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,950
would you rate the metric roll out so

441
00:18:35,349 --> 00:18:39,278
far

442
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:41,048
seventy percent rated a one or two are

443
00:18:39,278 --> 00:18:42,880
you more or less profitable than you

444
00:18:41,048 --> 00:18:46,690
were last year fifty-three percent are

445
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:48,820
less profitable are you hiring one third

446
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:51,399
is hiring two-thirds or frozen

447
00:18:48,819 --> 00:18:53,408
do you believe California has created an

448
00:18:51,398 --> 00:18:55,658
environment in which small cannabis

449
00:18:53,409 --> 00:18:58,090
businesses can succeed ninety-five

450
00:18:55,659 --> 00:19:00,278
percent said no so these are the same

451
00:18:58,089 --> 00:19:03,939
questions we asked last year but of

452
00:19:00,278 --> 00:19:06,220
stark difference in just the financial

453
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:07,960
well I'm not going to be the doctor

454
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:12,278
those are the vitals what do you think

455
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:14,740
doctor yeah it's sort of terrifying

456
00:19:12,278 --> 00:19:16,839
right and when you see that that's one

457
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:19,569
of the felt like that's not a very good

458
00:19:16,839 --> 00:19:22,829
report card and I don't know how long

459
00:19:19,569 --> 00:19:25,480
I'd be a doctor with those that's right

460
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:27,668
yeah it's it's it's definitely alarming

461
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:29,798
I think but to your point on what

462
00:19:27,669 --> 00:19:33,159
success looks like you know getting

463
00:19:29,798 --> 00:19:34,690
those numbers up will tie into helping a

464
00:19:33,159 --> 00:19:36,640
lot of the operators here that are going

465
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:38,380
through that and you know your

466
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,520
commitment on doing the QA and all that

467
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:41,740
stuff it's just like we're gonna have to

468
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:45,940
attack it from a lot of different angles

469
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:47,950
so this is on the interagency one do we

470
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:49,630
need a task force or Commission with

471
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:51,250
representative from the BC seafood and

472
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:53,528
Ag Public Health tax and fee

473
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:57,220
Administration to facilitate interagency

474
00:19:53,528 --> 00:20:00,009
communication is that something that BC

475
00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:00,640
C is your quarterback I mean it goes

476
00:20:00,009 --> 00:20:03,220
back to

477
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:05,680
I said about coordination and yeah I

478
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:07,180
think that that's a great idea came up

479
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:11,049
with that that's a great idea no we're

480
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:13,360
just uh putting some ideas out there we

481
00:20:11,049 --> 00:20:14,529
got a lot conference we've been talking

482
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:17,979
about and getting feedback from

483
00:20:14,529 --> 00:20:21,579
everybody I think I think what you guys

484
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:23,380
I mean I think your ideas I mean we know

485
00:20:21,579 --> 00:20:24,939
the state certainly you guys figured

486
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:26,920
this out we don't have the market on all

487
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:30,400
the good ideas you have a lot of good

488
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:32,769
ideas and you know we work for you you

489
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:35,590
you're paying your taxes you paint your

490
00:20:32,769 --> 00:20:38,079
license fee fee so some of this stuff is

491
00:20:35,589 --> 00:20:39,579
is good to demand like hey we need

492
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:41,259
better inter coordination how about

493
00:20:39,579 --> 00:20:43,869
putting a task force I actually like

494
00:20:41,259 --> 00:20:45,430
that idea so I am I'm in favor of

495
00:20:43,869 --> 00:20:47,379
something like that I don't know should

496
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:49,630
I don't know about quarterbacking it can

497
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:56,680
you know but I'm a Mac every team needs

498
00:20:49,630 --> 00:21:02,410
a quarterback the doctor I know doctor

499
00:20:56,680 --> 00:21:04,299
stuff so this relates to metric so you

500
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:05,769
know seventy percent related one or two

501
00:21:04,299 --> 00:21:08,049
I mean not a lot of people have had

502
00:21:05,769 --> 00:21:10,240
access to it yet so I think that what

503
00:21:08,049 --> 00:21:12,819
the data is a little skewed our

504
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,470
experience at Meadow has been pretty

505
00:21:12,819 --> 00:21:17,589
interesting you know our engineers had

506
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:20,400
no access to the UI we had to build

507
00:21:17,589 --> 00:21:22,629
pretty much in the dark on it and

508
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,670
metrics not that user-friendly it's a

509
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:25,990
little bit slow it's prone it's really

510
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:28,230
prone to human error if you don't know

511
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:31,059
the system intuitively it's it's there

512
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:32,289
so it's pretty cumbersome to account for

513
00:21:31,059 --> 00:21:34,419
especially when you're building software

514
00:21:32,289 --> 00:21:35,740
to integrate something that that's there

515
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:38,380
and we also have found a lot of

516
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:40,509
artifacts from other states that weren't

517
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:43,690
California specific as we were going

518
00:21:40,509 --> 00:21:45,789
through so you know one thing that we're

519
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:47,620
seeing is once you get access to metric

520
00:21:45,789 --> 00:21:49,779
you have to order your tags and then

521
00:21:47,619 --> 00:21:51,969
once you get your tags I have to put

522
00:21:49,779 --> 00:21:55,569
your inventory in right but the clock

523
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:58,299
starts 30 days from the time you have

524
00:21:55,569 --> 00:22:00,669
your training not 30 days after you get

525
00:21:58,299 --> 00:22:02,289
your tags which i think is we basically

526
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:05,230
lose two three weeks of getting the

527
00:22:02,289 --> 00:22:06,819
inventory in so these are just some of

528
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:09,490
our experiences what's your experience

529
00:22:06,819 --> 00:22:11,740
with BCC what is the feedback they're

530
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:13,589
your gang from licenses is this working

531
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:17,460
the way you expected to I know it's not

532
00:22:13,589 --> 00:22:19,168
to your purview and control otherwise I

533
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:21,480
feel it would be in a better position

534
00:22:19,169 --> 00:22:24,720
that's just my opinion

535
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:27,240
but you know but here you're it's a big

536
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:29,880
thing that's coming so it's here so I

537
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:31,769
think we're experiencing some of the

538
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:34,440
same things you are

539
00:22:31,769 --> 00:22:36,808
we're seeing as it relates to even our

540
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:39,900
licence types like micro businesses for

541
00:22:36,808 --> 00:22:42,899
example it's very difficult if you're a

542
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:45,150
micro business manufacturer distribution

543
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:47,009
and retail how that looks in metric that

544
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:50,190
really wasn't accounted for very well

545
00:22:47,009 --> 00:22:52,079
and for a lot of us at BCC we probably

546
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:54,179
got to look at the system around the

547
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:57,028
same just recently we didn't have

548
00:22:54,179 --> 00:22:59,490
recently this to the system so we were

549
00:22:57,028 --> 00:23:01,890
relying on another agency to sort of

550
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:03,839
navigate our regs so we're we're finding

551
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:08,490
we need to we're already asking for

552
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:10,889
changes from metric because I don't feel

553
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:13,200
it's intuitive now at least we get on

554
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:15,720
there and we're like I can only imagine

555
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:17,548
that if you're having to do this every

556
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:19,470
day you really do almost have to have

557
00:23:17,548 --> 00:23:21,298
someone that understands the system hire

558
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:24,120
someone specifically just to do metric

559
00:23:21,298 --> 00:23:28,079
so I think we need to make improvements

560
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:32,000
there and - I like you were saying I

561
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:35,009
feel like the rollout probably wasn't is

562
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:38,548
you know didn't go as well as we thought

563
00:23:35,009 --> 00:23:40,169
it would for us we know like I I don't

564
00:23:38,548 --> 00:23:41,730
even know if it was a good idea telling

565
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:43,500
you guys that you have to put all your

566
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:45,980
inventory that our regs say that you

567
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:49,890
don't put all your inventory yeah and

568
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:52,349
we're unfortunately if I think if we

569
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:54,240
knew - understood metric and how it

570
00:23:52,349 --> 00:23:55,589
worked better last year because we

571
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,000
didn't have access to the system I don't

572
00:23:55,589 --> 00:23:59,788
think we would have asked you guys to do

573
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,769
that so one of the things we're doing is

574
00:23:59,788 --> 00:24:03,720
if some of you are retailers or

575
00:24:01,769 --> 00:24:05,970
distributors we've actually turned off

576
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:08,278
your ability to get tags because we want

577
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:10,558
to we want to reach out to you first so

578
00:24:08,278 --> 00:24:12,720
we can explain what we expect because we

579
00:24:10,558 --> 00:24:14,819
had we had retailers asking for like

580
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:17,640
50,000 tags because they planned on

581
00:24:14,819 --> 00:24:19,558
tagging every single product and we've

582
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:22,710
saying no we don't want you to do that

583
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:25,379
we just want you to tag one like candy

584
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:27,298
bar and say hey we've got 5,000 units of

585
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:30,509
candy bar instead of doing every

586
00:24:27,298 --> 00:24:31,859
so we've been trying to like yeah we've

587
00:24:30,509 --> 00:24:33,960
been seeing that too yeah

588
00:24:31,859 --> 00:24:36,359
fixed that a little bit so you're not

589
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:38,220
spending so much time at the though at

590
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:41,099
the beginning trying to log your

591
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:42,600
inventory and so we're learning like

592
00:24:41,099 --> 00:24:44,368
right there with you which you probably

593
00:24:42,599 --> 00:24:46,408
won't really that's sort of scary but

594
00:24:44,368 --> 00:24:48,959
what we are finding is it's taking up a

595
00:24:46,409 --> 00:24:52,320
lot of our time and so we're pulling

596
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:54,690
from position percent it's it's it's a

597
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:57,989
it's a lot I've got one full time person

598
00:24:54,690 --> 00:25:00,629
I'm bringing in a whole unit just on the

599
00:24:57,989 --> 00:25:03,749
BCC side to deal with the questions and

600
00:25:00,628 --> 00:25:05,189
the issues and what we have so you're

601
00:25:03,749 --> 00:25:07,528
gonna see from us in the next coming

602
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:10,009
months putting more resources to help

603
00:25:07,528 --> 00:25:13,108
you guys because I think that is our job

604
00:25:10,009 --> 00:25:15,298
this is the state system we got to help

605
00:25:13,108 --> 00:25:17,548
you navigate it and that means we we've

606
00:25:15,298 --> 00:25:19,408
found that even with BCC we have to have

607
00:25:17,548 --> 00:25:21,778
the the folks on our side that

608
00:25:19,409 --> 00:25:23,519
understand metric too well so we can

609
00:25:21,778 --> 00:25:25,440
walk because I we're not we're not I

610
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:27,778
don't know that going to metric is the

611
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,340
answer we've got to have the answers for

612
00:25:27,778 --> 00:25:32,700
you and walk you through the process but

613
00:25:29,339 --> 00:25:36,298
I think we'll get there I but I want you

614
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:38,100
to know on the BCC side we're not I mean

615
00:25:36,298 --> 00:25:40,618
as much as we say you got to have that

616
00:25:38,099 --> 00:25:43,168
inventory or tags order you know we're

617
00:25:40,618 --> 00:25:44,819
very flexible on those timelines in our

618
00:25:43,169 --> 00:25:50,330
regulation very variable

619
00:25:44,819 --> 00:25:50,329
we are very flexible great so thank you

620
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:57,899
okay one thing that has recently

621
00:25:54,058 --> 00:26:04,499
happened with metric anyway I just want

622
00:25:57,898 --> 00:26:06,959
you also want to get you credentials I

623
00:26:04,499 --> 00:26:09,239
think we're just like we agree we're

624
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:12,749
happy this makes us happy okay smiling

625
00:26:09,239 --> 00:26:16,009
faces okay

626
00:26:12,749 --> 00:26:19,499
metric recently opened its additives API

627
00:26:16,009 --> 00:26:20,909
based on a request from the state how

628
00:26:19,499 --> 00:26:22,980
our request from the state to metric

629
00:26:20,909 --> 00:26:24,450
handled and prioritize our they're going

630
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:25,889
to go are there going to be any metric

631
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:27,419
user groups where people and Industry

632
00:26:25,888 --> 00:26:30,148
can weigh in on feature and API

633
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:34,049
prioritization I would love that that I

634
00:26:30,148 --> 00:26:36,778
think if you leave here today and you go

635
00:26:34,048 --> 00:26:38,308
back and go to see DFA and metric and

636
00:26:36,778 --> 00:26:40,740
say that I think that would be great

637
00:26:38,308 --> 00:26:42,808
because here's the problem

638
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:45,720
we've all asked for a few things - like

639
00:26:42,808 --> 00:26:47,910
one I don't know if any of you knew this

640
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:50,460
but the certificate of analysis that the

641
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:52,830
labs fill out there was no ability for

642
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:55,319
them to upload that yeah I know that you

643
00:26:52,829 --> 00:26:57,058
knew that or every see I don't know if

644
00:26:55,319 --> 00:26:58,769
there's any lab folks here but if you're

645
00:26:57,058 --> 00:27:01,289
you would have to go through for every

646
00:26:58,769 --> 00:27:04,889
test and right right you know click you

647
00:27:01,289 --> 00:27:07,710
know pass fail pass fail and so we did

648
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:09,450
we are having that change so you are

649
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:11,250
gonna get your results faster right you

650
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:13,558
can just upload it and store it so

651
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:15,240
though that's just one of them but we

652
00:27:13,558 --> 00:27:17,910
like again we've had some issues with

653
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:20,490
the distributors one so of course when

654
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:22,470
you're BC C we want to say we're top

655
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:24,870
priority right but then Public Health

656
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:26,308
may have a priority and food and AG may

657
00:27:24,869 --> 00:27:28,049
have a priority so it gets very

658
00:27:26,308 --> 00:27:29,490
difficult when the three of us are

659
00:27:28,049 --> 00:27:32,609
trying to prioritize because we all

660
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:34,589
think that's a priority maybe the answer

661
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:36,959
is and you guys are brilliant here is

662
00:27:34,589 --> 00:27:38,669
the industry prioritize it what's

663
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,679
affecting you the most what do we need

664
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:42,240
to work on first and what can wait so I

665
00:27:40,679 --> 00:27:43,530
think that's you got you're onto

666
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,480
something there yeah we've actually

667
00:27:43,529 --> 00:27:47,700
organized or self-organized

668
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:50,970
in a lot of the trade organizations

669
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:53,009
track and trace groups you know for the

670
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:54,420
cannabis distribution Association we

671
00:27:53,009 --> 00:27:57,179
have a weekly meeting on metric calls

672
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:59,400
where we're just troubleshooting and

673
00:27:57,179 --> 00:28:01,230
providing advice and saying hey this is

674
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:04,230
what you should do here you know

675
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:06,329
recently the transfer API is open if you

676
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:08,220
request it which is really important if

677
00:28:06,329 --> 00:28:10,199
you think about the transfer API before

678
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:13,529
that you had to create everything within

679
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:14,429
the system and now I can can use it but

680
00:28:13,529 --> 00:28:16,259
a lot of this stuff isn't being

681
00:28:14,429 --> 00:28:18,780
published like you don't know unless you

682
00:28:16,259 --> 00:28:21,029
know so I really encourage everyone to

683
00:28:18,779 --> 00:28:24,509
get engaged with their their

684
00:28:21,029 --> 00:28:26,308
associations and the regulatory bodies -

685
00:28:24,509 --> 00:28:30,058
to really get a handle on it because

686
00:28:26,308 --> 00:28:32,039
there are a lot of nuances here but I'm

687
00:28:30,058 --> 00:28:35,849
glad that you you share the pain of

688
00:28:32,039 --> 00:28:38,279
metric do and I think if you're if we're

689
00:28:35,849 --> 00:28:41,639
not putting good data in the system then

690
00:28:38,279 --> 00:28:42,058
what uses metric right so we we have -

691
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:46,530
right

692
00:28:42,058 --> 00:28:49,769
it's absolutely yeah switching gears

693
00:28:46,529 --> 00:28:54,289
what social equity mean to you what does

694
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:54,289
a successful equity program look like

695
00:28:54,849 --> 00:28:59,329
well I I don't know that I know what a

696
00:28:57,470 --> 00:29:01,279
successful program looks like because

697
00:28:59,329 --> 00:29:03,559
apparently we put one out and then we

698
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:05,509
took it back so we're working on it

699
00:29:03,559 --> 00:29:07,190
again so you think about it we think

700
00:29:05,509 --> 00:29:09,200
about a little bit more which isn't a

701
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:11,509
bad thing by the way I think it's always

702
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:13,850
you know it's always good to be able to

703
00:29:11,509 --> 00:29:15,410
look at something and say hey maybe we

704
00:29:13,849 --> 00:29:19,369
didn't really hit the mark on that let's

705
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:22,060
pull it back so I think for for us at

706
00:29:19,369 --> 00:29:25,669
the bureau I think it goes back to

707
00:29:22,059 --> 00:29:27,950
struggles and who are the pioneers with

708
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:31,580
this product and getting legalization

709
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:35,240
and are they sitting at the table and I

710
00:29:31,579 --> 00:29:37,699
think it's making sure that it's open

711
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:40,490
for anybody that wants to get a license

712
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:43,549
or be in a business or be employed by a

713
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:45,259
business in cannabis that it is a very

714
00:29:43,549 --> 00:29:47,180
positive experience I don't you don't

715
00:29:45,259 --> 00:29:49,369
want anybody left behind you're right

716
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:52,279
we're not we're not arresting people

717
00:29:49,369 --> 00:29:54,319
like we used to but it that I don't

718
00:29:52,279 --> 00:29:57,799
think that's enough we need to as a

719
00:29:54,319 --> 00:30:00,439
state we need to bring be more inclusive

720
00:29:57,799 --> 00:30:03,019
and bring those that were really the

721
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:06,289
ones that were most affected by the war

722
00:30:03,019 --> 00:30:08,779
on drugs into the system and I think

723
00:30:06,289 --> 00:30:10,549
we're still navigating that I do think

724
00:30:08,779 --> 00:30:12,649
you're seeing a commitment on the

725
00:30:10,549 --> 00:30:14,930
administration because not only do we

726
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:18,519
have the ten million now we have the 15

727
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:22,490
million and you know I I think that

728
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:24,410
conversation and and it has as people

729
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:26,120
are talking and so and I know money

730
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:27,890
doesn't solve everything but it sure

731
00:30:26,119 --> 00:30:30,589
does help because one of the things we

732
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:34,090
even putting out our equity application

733
00:30:30,589 --> 00:30:37,819
in the month of March we were seeing

734
00:30:34,089 --> 00:30:41,299
jurisdictions passing equity ordinances

735
00:30:37,819 --> 00:30:43,369
at like a like a real tremendous rate is

736
00:30:41,299 --> 00:30:46,819
like wow they made this happen pretty

737
00:30:43,369 --> 00:30:49,189
quick yeah and so that was a good thing

738
00:30:46,819 --> 00:30:50,929
and I think that that was what sort of

739
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:53,420
triggered we're gonna need more money

740
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:56,900
there's a lot of jurisdictions out there

741
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:59,810
that are putting social equity making it

742
00:30:56,900 --> 00:31:01,850
a priority so I'm happy that we're part

743
00:30:59,809 --> 00:31:03,829
of this I think we're still trying to

744
00:31:01,849 --> 00:31:05,179
figure out what is a successful equity

745
00:31:03,829 --> 00:31:06,289
program but I think you're gonna see

746
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:08,779
some frontrunners

747
00:31:06,289 --> 00:31:11,809
up from some of these cities that have

748
00:31:08,779 --> 00:31:14,000
been doing it for for a while and I

749
00:31:11,809 --> 00:31:16,250
think you're gonna see and I'm hoping by

750
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,690
you know we'll get that money out

751
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:19,130
because I think the important thing it's

752
00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:20,720
one thing to waive money around but you

753
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:23,510
got to get in the hands right you gotta

754
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:26,539
get in your hands because you guys can't

755
00:31:23,509 --> 00:31:29,390
wait and and we get that so well

756
00:31:26,539 --> 00:31:32,539
actually it was interesting Risa and Kat

757
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:34,160
and Joe and Nicole yesterday they

758
00:31:32,539 --> 00:31:35,869
mentioned something about they had to go

759
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:37,580
through all these hoops and setting up

760
00:31:35,869 --> 00:31:39,829
their social equity programs at the

761
00:31:37,579 --> 00:31:41,509
entire structure and they were thinking

762
00:31:39,829 --> 00:31:44,240
about trying not so much open source but

763
00:31:41,509 --> 00:31:46,700
create documentation and process and

764
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:48,200
help other counties and cities staged up

765
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:52,400
these programs and when it comes to

766
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:53,990
social equity a more homogeneous system

767
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:57,920
throughout the state which you know

768
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:58,880
allows it makes it more frictionless you

769
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:00,470
know one thing that we've been seeing

770
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,330
that's alarming though is how do you

771
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:05,509
prevent equity programs from being taken

772
00:32:02,329 --> 00:32:07,909
advantage of by predatory actors who are

773
00:32:05,509 --> 00:32:13,009
not intended beneficiaries of these

774
00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:14,840
licenses I think any time the state is

775
00:32:13,009 --> 00:32:16,819
giving money to the city and county it's

776
00:32:14,839 --> 00:32:19,309
our responsibility to make sure that

777
00:32:16,819 --> 00:32:22,009
money is being used appropriately and

778
00:32:19,309 --> 00:32:24,200
that we are monitoring things like that

779
00:32:22,009 --> 00:32:28,279
I don't know that we're always going to

780
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:30,529
be able to catch that but I think for

781
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:33,170
the most part I think we will have a

782
00:32:30,529 --> 00:32:35,690
good system in place that we can at

783
00:32:33,170 --> 00:32:38,330
least audit and make sure you know it's

784
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:40,070
going to who it should be going to and I

785
00:32:38,329 --> 00:32:41,720
think we rely you know like anything

786
00:32:40,069 --> 00:32:44,419
like complaints or anything I think we

787
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:48,710
rely a lot on the industry to bring

788
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:50,690
information forward to us all right

789
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:53,509
that's great thank you for your sharing

790
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:55,519
that taxes it should be no surprise that

791
00:32:53,509 --> 00:32:57,109
taxes are a major point and contention

792
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:59,269
for licensees up and down the supply

793
00:32:57,109 --> 00:33:01,549
chain when there have been opportunities

794
00:32:59,269 --> 00:33:03,109
for reprieve from these taxes the

795
00:33:01,549 --> 00:33:06,200
attempts at reform seem to consistently

796
00:33:03,109 --> 00:33:08,209
fail in a recent example bonta's bill a

797
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:10,279
B 286 would have put a pause in the

798
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:12,620
cultivation tax and given a one-year

799
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:14,629
reprieve to farmers to show that

800
00:33:12,619 --> 00:33:18,049
decrease in taxes will lead to an

801
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:19,410
increase overall in your opinion you

802
00:33:18,049 --> 00:33:21,869
know what's this

803
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:25,410
axes why aren't we moving forward on

804
00:33:21,869 --> 00:33:27,629
lowering it or you know why are we what

805
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:33,210
were you thinking and are we on taxes

806
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:36,660
I know it's under your butt just well I

807
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:38,850
think it's like you know I mean taxes is

808
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:40,769
not a you know that's not a popular term

809
00:33:38,849 --> 00:33:43,889
really when you think taxes you think

810
00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:46,200
negatively right and I I think when you

811
00:33:43,890 --> 00:33:48,350
have different tax structures from the

812
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:50,580
state and then your local local

813
00:33:48,349 --> 00:33:53,069
jurisdiction has a different tax rate I

814
00:33:50,579 --> 00:33:55,649
think it just makes it very difficult I

815
00:33:53,069 --> 00:33:57,000
think one thing I've been learning is

816
00:33:55,650 --> 00:33:58,860
like I think everybody just thinks

817
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:01,049
you're making all this money and so you

818
00:33:58,859 --> 00:34:03,059
can pay all this taxes but I think again

819
00:34:01,049 --> 00:34:05,129
it's a balanced approach because it's

820
00:34:03,059 --> 00:34:07,109
not just the taxes you're hit you're all

821
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:08,669
getting licensing fees now I mean you're

822
00:34:07,109 --> 00:34:12,089
having to pay licensing fees and all

823
00:34:08,668 --> 00:34:13,199
that so so our feeling is is I want

824
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:15,829
whatever it's going to be more

825
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:18,869
successful for the industry and I think

826
00:34:15,829 --> 00:34:20,069
it's very difficult for you to plan when

827
00:34:18,869 --> 00:34:22,319
there's different when you have state

828
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:25,110
taxes you have different local taxes I

829
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:27,419
think it would be nice if we had a more

830
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:30,030
I think thoughtful approach when it came

831
00:34:27,418 --> 00:34:31,679
when it comes to taxes but and then it's

832
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:33,390
hard to pay for your taxes and I always

833
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:34,829
say if it's gonna be hard to pay for

834
00:34:33,389 --> 00:34:37,918
your taxes who's gonna do them right

835
00:34:34,829 --> 00:34:39,418
yeah I mean and it's in cash and all

836
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:43,379
that I mean one of the things that we're

837
00:34:39,418 --> 00:34:45,179
really scared of on July 1 is or at

838
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:47,599
least I'm scared of you guys can be

839
00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:51,329
scared of whatever you're scared of is

840
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:55,949
the possibility of Sidi TFA raising the

841
00:34:51,329 --> 00:34:58,259
excise tax and you know in my mind if it

842
00:34:55,949 --> 00:35:00,389
goes from a 60 percent markup to 100

843
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:02,250
percent markup or 80 percent whatever it

844
00:35:00,389 --> 00:35:04,799
is you're gonna see an effective tax

845
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:07,019
rate go from 24 percent to 30 percent at

846
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:09,000
the distribution level to the retail

847
00:35:07,019 --> 00:35:12,599
level and then to the consumer you're

848
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:14,909
gonna see 8 to 12 percent because you're

849
00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:17,190
gonna see the the excise is - built in

850
00:35:14,909 --> 00:35:19,920
the cogs that local tax is going to tax

851
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:22,530
it the state tax is going to tax it so

852
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:26,240
you're looking at yeah another 10% of

853
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:29,040
increase in prices to the consumer and

854
00:35:26,239 --> 00:35:32,699
you know if that happens it's being done

855
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:33,659
on data that isn't in the state track

856
00:35:32,699 --> 00:35:35,549
and trace

857
00:35:33,659 --> 00:35:36,960
so there's no way to really verify or

858
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:39,480
anything like that but you know I'm

859
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:42,599
curious to hear your thoughts you know

860
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:44,760
have you heard rumblings of seed ETF a

861
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:47,159
potentially doing that you know Nick was

862
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:49,200
in the CCI a summit he says we have the

863
00:35:47,159 --> 00:35:50,759
authority to do it we're looking at it

864
00:35:49,199 --> 00:35:53,309
he didn't say it was going to be done

865
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:58,440
this but this is months ago and I'm just

866
00:35:53,309 --> 00:36:01,199
trying to prepare myself on July 1 so I

867
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:03,450
and I by the way we talked to CDT cafe a

868
00:36:01,199 --> 00:36:05,789
lot and I I do think they get it do they

869
00:36:03,449 --> 00:36:07,710
think the markups higher perhaps but I

870
00:36:05,789 --> 00:36:09,779
think they understand that it's gonna

871
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:12,269
just create volatility oh it's super

872
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:14,519
fragile right now but I think again

873
00:36:12,269 --> 00:36:16,530
having that mark a wholesale price

874
00:36:14,519 --> 00:36:19,500
markup that can change every six months

875
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:20,910
it does doesn't create like comfort

876
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:22,559
level right because you think you're

877
00:36:20,909 --> 00:36:23,849
good for six months and then the next

878
00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:25,529
six months it could be something else

879
00:36:23,849 --> 00:36:27,569
and it was a big reason why we changed

880
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:30,810
our licensing fees we were basing our

881
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:32,880
licensing fees on that wholesale markup

882
00:36:30,809 --> 00:36:36,599
and so I think that's the difficult part

883
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:39,059
for the industry is just that every six

884
00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:41,489
months you're always like wondering

885
00:36:39,059 --> 00:36:44,489
what's going to happen and you know if

886
00:36:41,489 --> 00:36:47,189
and I think as state agencies you know

887
00:36:44,489 --> 00:36:50,759
it's not good when we're creating this

888
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:54,150
anxiety right I'm gonna tell you like I

889
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:56,100
know all of you worry cuz I worry - but

890
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:58,559
there's nothing worse when you guys

891
00:36:56,099 --> 00:37:02,119
don't know what's coming and have that

892
00:36:58,559 --> 00:37:06,000
anxiety and I think that again creates

893
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:07,679
folks maybe not getting into a license

894
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,960
maybe because they're not sure and

895
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:12,389
things of that nature and and really I

896
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:14,429
think we need to give you guys more a

897
00:37:12,389 --> 00:37:16,739
better comfort level of what's coming

898
00:37:14,429 --> 00:37:19,250
down the road I mean especially as their

899
00:37:16,739 --> 00:37:22,979
operators are not marketing up 100%

900
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:25,110
they're at 60% or 30%

901
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:27,929
I've seen some at 30 I don't know why

902
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:29,730
but there are 30 and without track and

903
00:37:27,929 --> 00:37:31,139
trace I mean they're looking at what you

904
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:33,030
know they're looking at some of the

905
00:37:31,139 --> 00:37:35,670
invoices and our Manifest but it's not

906
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:38,160
giving them the information they need to

907
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:40,500
make that informed decision so but I

908
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:42,119
think they understand that though but I

909
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:44,179
think it's for us we don't we don't know

910
00:37:42,119 --> 00:37:47,170
what they're gonna do either though okay

911
00:37:44,179 --> 00:37:50,409
that I'm trying to cause anxiety don't

912
00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:53,619
yes it's all gonna be okay nothing is

913
00:37:50,409 --> 00:37:55,989
wrong everything is great nothing is

914
00:37:53,619 --> 00:37:57,608
wrong everything is great it was just

915
00:37:55,989 --> 00:38:00,659
this mantra we had at the Leadership

916
00:37:57,608 --> 00:38:02,230
Summit that's like you are perfect

917
00:38:00,659 --> 00:38:06,009
nothing is wrong

918
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:08,490
okay I mean do you anticipate and you

919
00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:12,460
were pre from taxes on the horizon

920
00:38:08,489 --> 00:38:14,289
no all right no more taxes all right

921
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:16,389
moving on I'll give you a good one all

922
00:38:14,289 --> 00:38:17,798
right to your point on the illicit

923
00:38:16,389 --> 00:38:20,529
market has been a pain point for

924
00:38:17,798 --> 00:38:22,150
licensees we know this is not lost in

925
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:24,609
the BCC and your office has taken

926
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:26,230
measures to battle this can you tell us

927
00:38:24,608 --> 00:38:28,480
more about the public awareness campaign

928
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:30,818
you are undertaking to point consumer

929
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:32,139
behavior toward licensed businesses do

930
00:38:30,818 --> 00:38:34,179
you think it will be sufficient when

931
00:38:32,139 --> 00:38:35,858
consumer behavior tends to be driven by

932
00:38:34,179 --> 00:38:38,139
do you think this will be sufficient

933
00:38:35,858 --> 00:38:42,489
though when consumer behavior tends to

934
00:38:38,139 --> 00:38:44,949
be driven by price and convenience so do

935
00:38:42,489 --> 00:38:48,789
I think is completely sufficient I think

936
00:38:44,949 --> 00:38:50,169
it's one part of what we need to do so I

937
00:38:48,789 --> 00:38:51,579
don't think it's going to solve I don't

938
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:53,230
think the public awareness campaign is

939
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:56,680
going to solve the illicit market at all

940
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:58,719
but I always look at it we got to come

941
00:38:56,679 --> 00:39:01,000
at it at all angles so you got to have

942
00:38:58,719 --> 00:39:04,088
aggressive enforcement you've got to

943
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:06,159
keep licensing people we've got to work

944
00:39:04,088 --> 00:39:08,650
with the jurisdictions to make sure I

945
00:39:06,159 --> 00:39:11,318
mean it's it it's getting weak we can't

946
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:12,940
issue licenses and a majority of the

947
00:39:11,318 --> 00:39:16,358
cities and county so we got to keep on

948
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:18,130
that and then we wanted to have a public

949
00:39:16,358 --> 00:39:21,029
awareness campaign too because sometimes

950
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:24,548
I think we forget a lot of us you know

951
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:26,859
cannabis is 24/7 but for the average

952
00:39:24,548 --> 00:39:29,409
consumer they're just looking like you

953
00:39:26,858 --> 00:39:31,088
said for the price point and we're where

954
00:39:29,409 --> 00:39:33,190
I can get cannabis they're not living

955
00:39:31,088 --> 00:39:34,210
this they don't understand so they're

956
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:36,608
gonna get it where they can get it

957
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:38,588
cheaper but if we can sort of change

958
00:39:36,608 --> 00:39:42,098
some of these California consumers mind

959
00:39:38,588 --> 00:39:45,818
that we want you to shop licensed shops

960
00:39:42,099 --> 00:39:47,619
we want you to get safe cannabis is it

961
00:39:45,818 --> 00:39:50,619
gonna change everybody's mind no but I

962
00:39:47,619 --> 00:39:54,220
know this is California is you know big

963
00:39:50,619 --> 00:39:56,920
on organics and you know you know craft

964
00:39:54,219 --> 00:39:59,199
products and so I think you can sway

965
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:00,880
some people to go over there way to say

966
00:39:59,199 --> 00:40:02,949
hey do they have a license or not

967
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:05,650
and ask that question so that's one part

968
00:40:02,949 --> 00:40:07,089
of the campaign and again it's it's

969
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:09,329
something is it going to change

970
00:40:07,090 --> 00:40:13,230
everything no the other part is to

971
00:40:09,329 --> 00:40:16,360
really inform the illegal market that

972
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:19,570
we're you know we know where you are so

973
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:22,660
yeah like with me yeah you like that

974
00:40:19,570 --> 00:40:24,100
yeah all right you know it's time to get

975
00:40:22,659 --> 00:40:26,769
licensed and this is how you get

976
00:40:24,099 --> 00:40:29,920
licensed and so is it gonna change

977
00:40:26,769 --> 00:40:32,409
everybody no but I you know I'm a big

978
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:35,559
believer you just hit everybody on all

979
00:40:32,409 --> 00:40:38,799
fronts this unlicensed market and you're

980
00:40:35,559 --> 00:40:42,219
hoping that you get more people into the

981
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:44,530
regulated market and so that's Alex

982
00:40:42,219 --> 00:40:47,049
where's Alex traverses over there he's

983
00:40:44,530 --> 00:40:49,950
actually leading up that so you know he

984
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:51,970
is very good about taking feedback

985
00:40:49,949 --> 00:40:55,059
they're going you know they've been

986
00:40:51,969 --> 00:40:57,789
going to the associations and running by

987
00:40:55,059 --> 00:40:59,469
some of our ads you know it's always

988
00:40:57,789 --> 00:41:01,029
good for us to get feedback because you

989
00:40:59,469 --> 00:41:02,980
know the state trying to do ads

990
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:05,530
sometimes they you know you probably are

991
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:07,990
going this is not gonna work right so

992
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:10,360
see CIA's been very good California

993
00:41:07,989 --> 00:41:13,569
minority alliance so you guys have a

994
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:15,309
better idea of what's gonna work so so

995
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:17,650
it's it's been a great learning

996
00:41:15,309 --> 00:41:19,389
experience and so I I really encourage

997
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:21,760
you guys if you have any good ideas

998
00:41:19,389 --> 00:41:23,799
please let us know because again what

999
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:26,230
works up here in Mendocino County

1000
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:28,180
probably doesn't work in LA so it's it's

1001
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:29,769
it's been a pretty big undertaking I

1002
00:41:28,179 --> 00:41:31,119
think a lot more work than I expected

1003
00:41:29,769 --> 00:41:33,550
but I think it's a good thing yeah

1004
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:35,500
that's great I think any message to help

1005
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:37,630
educate the consumers I always say

1006
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:39,070
nothing is easy in cannabis is that what

1007
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:41,890
you guys feel something it's like

1008
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:43,870
whatever it's but it's all worth the

1009
00:41:41,889 --> 00:41:45,609
effort by the way and I truly believe

1010
00:41:43,869 --> 00:41:48,969
that it's not easy but it's worth the

1011
00:41:45,610 --> 00:41:50,980
effort I agree that we're crushing right

1012
00:41:48,969 --> 00:41:53,319
now I think we have four more questions

1013
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:58,240
so we may have time for like two more

1014
00:41:53,320 --> 00:42:00,039
two or three questions what are your

1015
00:41:58,239 --> 00:42:01,449
biggest fears for the viability of the

1016
00:42:00,039 --> 00:42:08,320
regulated cannabis industry in

1017
00:42:01,449 --> 00:42:11,199
California I'm pretty simple I we we've

1018
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:13,960
got to make sure the regulated market is

1019
00:42:11,199 --> 00:42:14,649
successful and what I mean by successful

1020
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:16,900
that you're

1021
00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:21,820
you're able to hire people you're able

1022
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:24,220
to make money and that is as far as I'm

1023
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:27,640
concerned that is our task here is to

1024
00:42:24,219 --> 00:42:29,199
make you successful and we need to do

1025
00:42:27,639 --> 00:42:31,239
whatever it takes to make sure that

1026
00:42:29,199 --> 00:42:33,189
happens because there is no I don't

1027
00:42:31,239 --> 00:42:35,379
think anybody here well maybe you do

1028
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:40,139
wants to go backwards I don't want to go

1029
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:43,090
backwards but read for it but it it does

1030
00:42:40,139 --> 00:42:45,670
it's it's not just the bureau by the way

1031
00:42:43,090 --> 00:42:47,890
it's the entire state it's all the state

1032
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:50,740
government it's the industry it's the

1033
00:42:47,889 --> 00:42:52,659
consumer it's really making sure you

1034
00:42:50,739 --> 00:42:56,109
know i i'd like to see cannabis really

1035
00:42:52,659 --> 00:42:58,899
nor i think it's already you know when i

1036
00:42:56,110 --> 00:43:01,950
looked at three years ago and now I mean

1037
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:04,990
cannabis is becoming normalized although

1038
00:43:01,949 --> 00:43:07,089
in you know invent and you guys are

1039
00:43:04,989 --> 00:43:09,609
innovative and all your products and

1040
00:43:07,090 --> 00:43:12,010
it's just incredible and you guys know I

1041
00:43:09,610 --> 00:43:14,170
come from alcohol and it's like such a

1042
00:43:12,010 --> 00:43:16,420
departure you know you have beer wine

1043
00:43:14,170 --> 00:43:19,090
distilled spirits and cannabis it's just

1044
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:21,760
like what it's it's it is truly amazing

1045
00:43:19,090 --> 00:43:25,510
what the entrepreneurs out here have

1046
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:27,610
been doing with cannabis and so you guys

1047
00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:30,460
I mean I just think you're gonna be I

1048
00:43:27,610 --> 00:43:34,780
mean this is where it is I think this is

1049
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:36,429
where it is I agree though we'll this is

1050
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:38,320
kind of interesting you know another

1051
00:43:36,429 --> 00:43:40,869
thing that's coming is hemp now there's

1052
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:44,170
a bill that's moving through that would

1053
00:43:40,869 --> 00:43:48,250
possibly bring in hemp agriculture in

1054
00:43:44,170 --> 00:43:50,530
California and also within our license

1055
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:53,139
market how do you view hemp and how do

1056
00:43:50,530 --> 00:43:55,210
you think about regulating it and we're

1057
00:43:53,139 --> 00:43:57,460
yeah are you thinking about it I think

1058
00:43:55,210 --> 00:43:59,019
about it a lot you guys think about it a

1059
00:43:57,460 --> 00:44:02,590
lot because we get a lot of questions on

1060
00:43:59,019 --> 00:44:07,000
him so um I I don't have any I think

1061
00:44:02,590 --> 00:44:10,690
hemp is and again I think it's a great

1062
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:13,119
product that if we read it but right now

1063
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:14,970
the the bureau or food nag or public

1064
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:17,949
health it doesn't fall under our

1065
00:44:14,969 --> 00:44:19,869
Authority it doesn't fall under a

1066
00:44:17,949 --> 00:44:23,349
cannabis or a cannabis product and the

1067
00:44:19,869 --> 00:44:25,420
definition under ma you see our say-so

1068
00:44:23,349 --> 00:44:28,860
I truly feel though if we're going to

1069
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:28,860
bring hemp into

1070
00:44:29,510 --> 00:44:32,840
you know I know you can get I mean as

1071
00:44:31,369 --> 00:44:34,909
you guys know our regulations don't

1072
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:38,090
allow distributors or retailers to

1073
00:44:34,909 --> 00:44:40,489
transport or sell hemp but and and you

1074
00:44:38,090 --> 00:44:42,079
probably think why if you say you're ok

1075
00:44:40,489 --> 00:44:44,149
with hemp and I'll tell you why I think

1076
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:46,369
hemp does need to be part of the

1077
00:44:44,150 --> 00:44:50,389
regulator market I think it should be

1078
00:44:46,369 --> 00:44:52,339
regulated for so it falls under cannabis

1079
00:44:50,389 --> 00:44:54,529
so that way you're benefiting from

1080
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:56,480
selling hemp because you're already

1081
00:44:54,530 --> 00:44:59,090
going through such strict standards with

1082
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:01,519
cannabis it makes sense that it comes

1083
00:44:59,090 --> 00:45:04,640
through you guys the proper supply chain

1084
00:45:01,519 --> 00:45:06,949
so our retailers and can sell it so

1085
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:08,480
we'll see what happens it looks like

1086
00:45:06,949 --> 00:45:10,339
there's movement

1087
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:11,750
yeah there's momentum and so I think

1088
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:13,460
that's a good thing for the industry

1089
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:15,320
because I really think that's going to

1090
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:17,269
help boost sales I think you know

1091
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:19,309
consumer is demanding more of these

1092
00:45:17,269 --> 00:45:22,340
products and I think it should fall

1093
00:45:19,309 --> 00:45:24,559
under us I think that is good for the

1094
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:26,750
licensees yeah because if anybody can

1095
00:45:24,559 --> 00:45:28,820
sell it and get it from anywhere in the

1096
00:45:26,750 --> 00:45:30,320
country and it can have and we don't

1097
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:35,000
even know what's in it I don't think

1098
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:38,390
that's good I agree right that's that's

1099
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:55,150
what we like to hear how do we reduce

1100
00:45:38,389 --> 00:45:58,369
plastic waste I think less packaging

1101
00:45:55,150 --> 00:46:02,840
standards or restrictions yeah I mean

1102
00:45:58,369 --> 00:46:06,559
that's that's the answer is it easy to

1103
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:08,840
get there maybe I think I think you know

1104
00:46:06,559 --> 00:46:11,509
we had a lot of childproof packaging and

1105
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:13,610
I think though that will change as

1106
00:46:11,510 --> 00:46:15,920
people understand the product better and

1107
00:46:13,610 --> 00:46:18,110
what we do really need to protect and

1108
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:20,480
childproof packaging but I we've heard

1109
00:46:18,110 --> 00:46:23,570
you guys that's a huge issue for and I

1110
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:25,340
mean I think rightfully so you should be

1111
00:46:23,570 --> 00:46:27,740
bringing it up and continue to bring it

1112
00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:30,470
up is there a possibility of

1113
00:46:27,739 --> 00:46:32,709
establishing B corpse for cannabis what

1114
00:46:30,469 --> 00:46:35,239
would it take what would it look like

1115
00:46:32,710 --> 00:46:36,889
what do you mean by B corpse you know

1116
00:46:35,239 --> 00:46:39,679
nonprofit for good

1117
00:46:36,889 --> 00:46:41,239
oh yeah we're doing them we're doing a

1118
00:46:39,679 --> 00:46:41,690
feasibility study right now for

1119
00:46:41,239 --> 00:46:45,049
non-prime

1120
00:46:41,690 --> 00:46:47,090
if it's if it's in the statute that PCC

1121
00:46:45,050 --> 00:46:50,090
has to have our feasibility study

1122
00:46:47,090 --> 00:46:52,730
finished and our report on whether it

1123
00:46:50,090 --> 00:46:56,420
makes sense to have nonprofits and that

1124
00:46:52,730 --> 00:46:58,369
is due on January 1st of 2020 so we're

1125
00:46:56,420 --> 00:46:59,900
right in the process right now we're

1126
00:46:58,369 --> 00:47:01,239
working with University of

1127
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:03,200
california-davis

1128
00:47:01,239 --> 00:47:06,139
feasibility study so if there's

1129
00:47:03,199 --> 00:47:07,579
something anybody has you know questions

1130
00:47:06,139 --> 00:47:09,079
about or you want to provide us some

1131
00:47:07,579 --> 00:47:12,049
information we'll be happy to have you

1132
00:47:09,079 --> 00:47:14,599
change especially if you know when the

1133
00:47:12,050 --> 00:47:17,360
compassion bill passes having those

1134
00:47:14,599 --> 00:47:19,549
outlets having that ability of being a

1135
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:21,590
non-profit would be helpful to a lot of

1136
00:47:19,550 --> 00:47:23,600
people and I think part of it if you're

1137
00:47:21,590 --> 00:47:25,700
wondering what's the feasibility study

1138
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:28,009
is its I mean do we I mean I think we're

1139
00:47:25,699 --> 00:47:29,929
looking at do nonprofits should we just

1140
00:47:28,010 --> 00:47:33,230
have nonprofits that are able to

1141
00:47:29,929 --> 00:47:36,230
continue to give you know care whether

1142
00:47:33,230 --> 00:47:38,539
it's our elderly or veterans or you know

1143
00:47:36,230 --> 00:47:40,550
low income and should we continue

1144
00:47:38,539 --> 00:47:43,300
without being part of the regulated

1145
00:47:40,550 --> 00:47:47,150
system but we have maybe some you know

1146
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:49,250
you know restrictions in place so it's

1147
00:47:47,150 --> 00:47:50,990
you know going to those populations or

1148
00:47:49,250 --> 00:47:53,030
do we want it part of the regulated

1149
00:47:50,989 --> 00:47:55,009
system and so I think that's part of

1150
00:47:53,030 --> 00:47:57,560
that feasibility study to see what's the

1151
00:47:55,010 --> 00:47:59,150
what's that best model yeah that's great

1152
00:47:57,559 --> 00:48:00,980
yeah I'm sure we can provide feedback on

1153
00:47:59,150 --> 00:48:04,690
that that's the last question I have

1154
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:07,460
we've been doing fantastic look at that

1155
00:48:04,690 --> 00:48:09,230
there are there's still friction between

1156
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:11,480
you know what the state wants and what

1157
00:48:09,230 --> 00:48:14,809
the locals want right and if we look at

1158
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:17,179
an example like a B 1356 that was being

1159
00:48:14,809 --> 00:48:19,670
moved through the committee it was Tings

1160
00:48:17,179 --> 00:48:21,469
bill essentially said it was trying to

1161
00:48:19,670 --> 00:48:22,639
open up retail licenses right I'm not

1162
00:48:21,469 --> 00:48:25,459
sure if you were following but for those

1163
00:48:22,639 --> 00:48:30,769
that weren't to summarize it's basically

1164
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:34,929
you have one license mandated for every

1165
00:48:30,769 --> 00:48:39,550
15,000 people in every jurisdiction that

1166
00:48:34,929 --> 00:48:42,619
voted in favor over 50% for prop 64 or

1167
00:48:39,550 --> 00:48:43,789
one license for every six alcohol

1168
00:48:42,619 --> 00:48:45,589
licenses I think that was the last

1169
00:48:43,789 --> 00:48:47,719
iteration that I saw something around

1170
00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:51,760
there it didn't move through committee

1171
00:48:47,719 --> 00:48:55,108
but it was a bold move in trying to push

1172
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:58,409
retail licenses and licenses in general

1173
00:48:55,108 --> 00:48:59,998
in these counties you know as its as

1174
00:48:58,409 --> 00:49:02,969
we've seen it's been pretty slow for

1175
00:48:59,998 --> 00:49:04,588
people to get regulated it's been slow

1176
00:49:02,969 --> 00:49:08,159
for people to make decisions and get

1177
00:49:04,588 --> 00:49:11,239
keep offices stood up resources are thin

1178
00:49:08,159 --> 00:49:13,979
to create another department to do that

1179
00:49:11,239 --> 00:49:18,088
you know so our thoughts around like how

1180
00:49:13,978 --> 00:49:19,978
do we work on state and local where's

1181
00:49:18,088 --> 00:49:21,688
that relationship you know you can only

1182
00:49:19,978 --> 00:49:23,639
do so much

1183
00:49:21,688 --> 00:49:27,199
local is where the rubber meets the road

1184
00:49:23,639 --> 00:49:31,048
and you know a lot of us are stuck and

1185
00:49:27,199 --> 00:49:32,729
working in in areas that may not allow

1186
00:49:31,048 --> 00:49:34,708
it or prohibit it or we have to travel

1187
00:49:32,728 --> 00:49:37,498
through areas that may not allow it or

1188
00:49:34,708 --> 00:49:38,969
prohibit it so there's a lot of friction

1189
00:49:37,498 --> 00:49:40,618
there but I think there's a way to make

1190
00:49:38,969 --> 00:49:43,918
it better if you know and open to your

1191
00:49:40,619 --> 00:49:45,989
thoughts and how we get there well I

1192
00:49:43,918 --> 00:49:48,150
think it's like anything you're you're

1193
00:49:45,989 --> 00:49:51,208
trying to open up hearts and minds to

1194
00:49:48,150 --> 00:49:53,969
cannabis regulation right and that's

1195
00:49:51,208 --> 00:49:57,688
sometimes is not an easy sell so for us

1196
00:49:53,969 --> 00:50:00,929
at the bureau it's making sure our folks

1197
00:49:57,688 --> 00:50:02,818
we're competing out to the jurisdictions

1198
00:50:00,929 --> 00:50:05,309
providing them resources where they need

1199
00:50:02,818 --> 00:50:07,259
them I think for a lot of cities and

1200
00:50:05,309 --> 00:50:09,028
counties it is a resource issues they

1201
00:50:07,259 --> 00:50:12,619
don't know where to turn to for answers

1202
00:50:09,028 --> 00:50:12,619
they don't know where to get started

1203
00:50:12,650 --> 00:50:16,409
Andre who's my governmental affairs

1204
00:50:15,059 --> 00:50:18,959
don't know where he is he's somewhere

1205
00:50:16,409 --> 00:50:23,130
Andres back in the back there is right

1206
00:50:18,958 --> 00:50:25,259
over there that's what he does 24/7 is

1207
00:50:23,130 --> 00:50:27,209
going around to all these jurisdictions

1208
00:50:25,259 --> 00:50:28,978
how can we help what can we look what

1209
00:50:27,208 --> 00:50:29,698
can we provide you what do you need from

1210
00:50:28,978 --> 00:50:31,588
us

1211
00:50:29,699 --> 00:50:34,168
we also are establishing our local

1212
00:50:31,588 --> 00:50:37,139
liaison unit so we have 10 analysts

1213
00:50:34,168 --> 00:50:39,568
we'll be hiring just to reach out to the

1214
00:50:37,139 --> 00:50:41,699
local jurisdictions to help them or when

1215
00:50:39,568 --> 00:50:43,139
they come you know a lot of times you

1216
00:50:41,699 --> 00:50:45,239
know you're going to them they don't

1217
00:50:43,139 --> 00:50:47,998
know how to answer questions and so I

1218
00:50:45,239 --> 00:50:50,429
think it's education education and

1219
00:50:47,998 --> 00:50:52,858
having resources and at least at the

1220
00:50:50,429 --> 00:50:55,499
bureau we think it's important that just

1221
00:50:52,858 --> 00:50:57,298
like you that we're responsive to them

1222
00:50:55,498 --> 00:50:58,889
and that we provide resources and if

1223
00:50:57,298 --> 00:51:00,748
that means we need to go do regional

1224
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:02,668
trainings we can you train their staff

1225
00:51:00,748 --> 00:51:06,448
we need to help train their applicants

1226
00:51:02,668 --> 00:51:08,339
that's what we're doing the Provisionals

1227
00:51:06,449 --> 00:51:10,980
with the temporaries that's sort of

1228
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:13,320
we're I'm hoping by the you know by the

1229
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:15,659
fall we're fully staffed in our local

1230
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:18,120
liaison you know unfortunately we've had

1231
00:51:15,659 --> 00:51:20,309
to we do have people in that unit but

1232
00:51:18,119 --> 00:51:22,440
they've all been there everybody's

1233
00:51:20,309 --> 00:51:25,079
working on making sure there's no gap in

1234
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:28,079
licensures from the temporaries to the

1235
00:51:25,079 --> 00:51:29,219
provisional that is like that is number

1236
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:31,230
one from that is our number one priority

1237
00:51:29,219 --> 00:51:32,369
and you want us to have that as our

1238
00:51:31,230 --> 00:51:35,039
number one priority right now

1239
00:51:32,369 --> 00:51:36,839
so thanks not for like waiting till last

1240
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:38,009
minute when your temp expires and you

1241
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:41,010
get your provisional you're like you're

1242
00:51:38,010 --> 00:51:43,800
sorry yeah we're trying and and just so

1243
00:51:41,010 --> 00:51:47,010
you know I know we mentioned CDFA and

1244
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:49,590
and I I understand it's been tough on

1245
00:51:47,010 --> 00:51:51,720
them I think we did give ourselves a

1246
00:51:49,590 --> 00:51:54,600
little bit more room because we pushed

1247
00:51:51,719 --> 00:51:57,449
out temporary expirations and that

1248
00:51:54,599 --> 00:52:00,420
really helped us you know get prepared

1249
00:51:57,449 --> 00:52:03,239
but we have been sending our own staff

1250
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:05,639
over to see DFA to a system we did in

1251
00:52:03,239 --> 00:52:08,069
March we sent six staff we have staff

1252
00:52:05,639 --> 00:52:09,719
there for staff right there so I don't

1253
00:52:08,070 --> 00:52:14,010
want you to think just when we see

1254
00:52:09,719 --> 00:52:16,019
another agency hurting we're also we

1255
00:52:14,010 --> 00:52:19,110
understand if if they're not successful

1256
00:52:16,019 --> 00:52:21,239
we're not successful so we do look at

1257
00:52:19,110 --> 00:52:23,430
those things and provide resources there

1258
00:52:21,239 --> 00:52:25,349
to wherever we can't help ya that's

1259
00:52:23,429 --> 00:52:27,899
appreciated and Andre if it's helpful

1260
00:52:25,349 --> 00:52:30,449
for like people the industry to go on

1261
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:33,539
with you to these local governments and

1262
00:52:30,449 --> 00:52:35,399
talk and you know just show who these

1263
00:52:33,539 --> 00:52:37,099
stakeholders are

1264
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:39,510
that were normal people that were

1265
00:52:37,099 --> 00:52:42,000
parents or family we're brothers or

1266
00:52:39,510 --> 00:52:45,560
husbands or like wives we can we can do

1267
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:48,869
that maybe we just create this SWAT team

1268
00:52:45,559 --> 00:52:54,659
coalition and we just met SWAT team go

1269
00:52:48,869 --> 00:52:56,819
through systematically I mean locals

1270
00:52:54,659 --> 00:52:59,670
have you know local regulators have a

1271
00:52:56,820 --> 00:53:02,580
lot of they should be you know we need

1272
00:52:59,670 --> 00:53:06,360
get in front of them alright alright so

1273
00:53:02,579 --> 00:53:09,269
we have a few questions here and how

1274
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:11,039
much time we have five minutes okay cool

1275
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:14,489
we have some questions hey all right

1276
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:19,730
when I get the mic over high five a lot

1277
00:53:14,489 --> 00:53:22,659
of questions are you doing today

1278
00:53:19,730 --> 00:53:24,579
so you were speaking earlier

1279
00:53:22,659 --> 00:53:26,799
enforcement and we know that the state

1280
00:53:24,579 --> 00:53:29,009
committed a lot of resources towards

1281
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:30,940
enforcement and while I agree

1282
00:53:29,010 --> 00:53:33,850
enforcement need there's a need for

1283
00:53:30,940 --> 00:53:35,260
enforcement there's like ten times the

1284
00:53:33,849 --> 00:53:37,869
need to make sure that everybody's

1285
00:53:35,260 --> 00:53:39,390
licensed in everybody who wants that

1286
00:53:37,869 --> 00:53:41,769
opportunity gets that opportunity

1287
00:53:39,389 --> 00:53:43,779
license so in thinking about that

1288
00:53:41,769 --> 00:53:45,250
hundred million dollars that was that

1289
00:53:43,780 --> 00:53:48,790
was put towards the bureau of

1290
00:53:45,250 --> 00:53:50,559
enforcement how it relates to equity so

1291
00:53:48,789 --> 00:53:52,349
I deal a lot with the equity community

1292
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:55,719
you talked about the money

1293
00:53:52,349 --> 00:53:59,170
ten million dollars in and now having to

1294
00:53:55,719 --> 00:54:02,349
rethink that adding 15 million I think

1295
00:53:59,170 --> 00:54:04,900
that you're asking the community that

1296
00:54:02,349 --> 00:54:08,650
can lease afford to wait for those

1297
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:10,599
resources to wait for resources and and

1298
00:54:08,650 --> 00:54:12,450
I think some of those millions that

1299
00:54:10,599 --> 00:54:14,860
Wintour's of forcement could have been

1300
00:54:12,449 --> 00:54:17,259
provided for the equity community and

1301
00:54:14,860 --> 00:54:19,930
they can't wait any more they need those

1302
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:23,290
funds now because they don't have access

1303
00:54:19,929 --> 00:54:25,690
to real estate loans family members that

1304
00:54:23,289 --> 00:54:27,880
have money they're struggling right now

1305
00:54:25,690 --> 00:54:30,010
in these equity programs are struggling

1306
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:32,289
with with funding to be able to process

1307
00:54:30,010 --> 00:54:34,660
those licenses we need that money now

1308
00:54:32,289 --> 00:54:35,259
and anything that you could do to make

1309
00:54:34,659 --> 00:54:45,779
that happen

1310
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:49,840
like urgency is necessary please III

1311
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:51,160
agree so we I it's one thing they have

1312
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:52,450
to say you have all these millions of

1313
00:54:51,159 --> 00:54:54,489
dollars it's another thing you got to

1314
00:54:52,449 --> 00:54:56,500
get it out to the folks that really need

1315
00:54:54,489 --> 00:54:59,439
it and they need it now and so we are

1316
00:54:56,500 --> 00:55:01,059
I'm going to tell you we're making but

1317
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:03,309
we also want to make sure it's getting

1318
00:55:01,059 --> 00:55:05,799
to the right people and I am gonna say

1319
00:55:03,309 --> 00:55:07,449
I'm happy that we're getting another 15

1320
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:09,700
million and I'm happy to see some of

1321
00:55:07,449 --> 00:55:10,629
these local jurisdictions start to come

1322
00:55:09,699 --> 00:55:12,929
on board because that's going to help

1323
00:55:10,630 --> 00:55:12,930
more people

1324
00:55:13,559 --> 00:55:19,659
my name is recent posh green and I know

1325
00:55:17,619 --> 00:55:21,759
you were talking about enforcement but

1326
00:55:19,659 --> 00:55:26,019
we all know the biggest problem that we

1327
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:27,760
are having as people that own

1328
00:55:26,019 --> 00:55:30,639
dispensaries people down deliveries as

1329
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:32,350
weed maps we all know we maps is a big

1330
00:55:30,639 --> 00:55:35,588
problem I don't understand what is

1331
00:55:32,349 --> 00:55:37,958
taking so long to get that under control

1332
00:55:35,588 --> 00:55:40,599
when other people have started on third

1333
00:55:37,958 --> 00:55:42,518
third party platform ordering systems to

1334
00:55:40,599 --> 00:55:45,729
take you off if you don't have a license

1335
00:55:42,518 --> 00:55:47,498
so why isn't we Mouse able that's why

1336
00:55:45,728 --> 00:55:48,788
we're seeing the prices at 30% low

1337
00:55:47,498 --> 00:55:51,458
because we cannot complete with the

1338
00:55:48,789 --> 00:55:52,719
black market I get calls daily from

1339
00:55:51,458 --> 00:55:54,759
other people there in their business

1340
00:55:52,719 --> 00:55:57,400
vendors and they're hurting and they

1341
00:55:54,759 --> 00:55:58,599
don't call they're like oh how you're

1342
00:55:57,400 --> 00:56:00,309
doing I'm like actually check my

1343
00:55:58,599 --> 00:56:02,109
delivery down to my store opens because

1344
00:56:00,309 --> 00:56:03,609
I can't afford it and I can't afford the

1345
00:56:02,108 --> 00:56:07,389
store especially being an equity

1346
00:56:03,608 --> 00:56:09,400
application so what people are saying is

1347
00:56:07,389 --> 00:56:11,288
that we're we're about to we're not

1348
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:14,318
gonna make and I mean people that's been

1349
00:56:11,289 --> 00:56:16,390
around for for a long time way before me

1350
00:56:14,318 --> 00:56:18,009
or it's having trouble because the black

1351
00:56:16,389 --> 00:56:20,528
market I don't mean just flowers I mean

1352
00:56:18,009 --> 00:56:22,568
teachers I mean babes they're getting

1353
00:56:20,528 --> 00:56:24,728
real crafty out there and it's killing

1354
00:56:22,568 --> 00:56:27,489
us and before you know it you guys are

1355
00:56:24,728 --> 00:56:29,679
not gonna have people around to get

1356
00:56:27,489 --> 00:56:31,358
money and to pioneer this industry

1357
00:56:29,679 --> 00:56:34,018
because of what's going on reading math

1358
00:56:31,358 --> 00:56:39,009
needs to be shut down

1359
00:56:34,018 --> 00:56:40,508
interesting hi Laurie hi hooah

1360
00:56:39,009 --> 00:56:42,670
my name is Jackie McGowan K Street

1361
00:56:40,509 --> 00:56:44,949
consulting thank you so much for this

1362
00:56:42,670 --> 00:56:47,650
event it's been amazing

1363
00:56:44,949 --> 00:56:49,659
my question is about BCC enforcement on

1364
00:56:47,650 --> 00:56:52,358
licensed operators and I'm going to use

1365
00:56:49,659 --> 00:56:55,149
a specific incident in Santa Cruz where

1366
00:56:52,358 --> 00:56:58,119
BCC enforcement agents showed up on an

1367
00:56:55,150 --> 00:57:00,969
unexpected unannounced flashing badges

1368
00:56:58,119 --> 00:57:03,309
forcing their way in pulling products

1369
00:57:00,969 --> 00:57:05,469
off shelves interrogating employees and

1370
00:57:03,309 --> 00:57:08,229
basically conducting a raid without

1371
00:57:05,469 --> 00:57:09,699
kicking the door in so first I want to

1372
00:57:08,228 --> 00:57:11,678
ask is there anyone in the audience that

1373
00:57:09,699 --> 00:57:17,650
knows what a BCC badge looks like raise

1374
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:19,449
your hand one one person no okay so I

1375
00:57:17,650 --> 00:57:22,959
want to know if there's going to be a

1376
00:57:19,449 --> 00:57:25,420
hotline that we can call to verify that

1377
00:57:22,958 --> 00:57:28,058
in that an inspection is occurring

1378
00:57:25,420 --> 00:57:29,259
because then this incident these

1379
00:57:28,059 --> 00:57:32,609
employees didn't know if they were being

1380
00:57:29,259 --> 00:57:35,978
robbed and there could be copycat

1381
00:57:32,608 --> 00:57:38,588
incidents like that but I think there

1382
00:57:35,978 --> 00:57:40,958
has to be education or at least in an

1383
00:57:38,588 --> 00:57:46,469
announcement as to when enforcement is

1384
00:57:40,958 --> 00:57:49,539
or an inspection is going to occur so

1385
00:57:46,469 --> 00:57:51,840
Jackie I don't know what specific

1386
00:57:49,539 --> 00:57:56,279
premises you're talking about but yeah

1387
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:59,890
normally our enforcement staff is very

1388
00:57:56,280 --> 00:58:04,060
professional we do not announce before

1389
00:57:59,889 --> 00:58:06,608
we go in you're right but they do have

1390
00:58:04,059 --> 00:58:10,210
ID saying they're from the Bureau and

1391
00:58:06,608 --> 00:58:12,460
they have business cards but if there's

1392
00:58:10,210 --> 00:58:15,820
something more that can give comfort to

1393
00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:19,179
our licensees that they know who's there

1394
00:58:15,820 --> 00:58:20,950
I think we're open to I don't know if

1395
00:58:19,179 --> 00:58:24,069
that's a hotline I'm not that may be

1396
00:58:20,949 --> 00:58:27,009
that that is I'll say this hotlines

1397
00:58:24,070 --> 00:58:30,010
something to verify then we're open to

1398
00:58:27,010 --> 00:58:33,400
something like that okay thank you for

1399
00:58:30,010 --> 00:58:37,150
that thank you thank you for providing

1400
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:39,490
such a great format for collaboration

1401
00:58:37,150 --> 00:58:42,460
within our industry as a statewide

1402
00:58:39,489 --> 00:58:45,219
distributor I would like a transparent

1403
00:58:42,460 --> 00:58:49,119
way to make an employee purchase and

1404
00:58:45,219 --> 00:58:55,118
give samples to my staff to responsibly

1405
00:58:49,119 --> 00:58:55,840
use yeah I mean there's a bill moving

1406
00:58:55,119 --> 00:58:57,940
forward

1407
00:58:55,840 --> 00:59:00,190
Skinner's bill which would would

1408
00:58:57,940 --> 00:59:01,900
definitely help that and it's looking

1409
00:59:00,190 --> 00:59:04,030
really good I agree it looks really

1410
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:05,170
promising so you may have your wish yeah

1411

1412
00:59:05,170 --> 00:59:08,740

1413
00:59:07,329 --> 00:59:12,250
take yeah I mean it's definitely a

1414
00:59:08,739 --> 00:59:14,589
collaboration but yep non cannabis

1415
00:59:12,250 --> 00:59:17,650
company and Trinity County of a very

1416
00:59:14,590 --> 00:59:21,309
specific question for you is bulk flour

1418
00:59:21,309 --> 00:59:27,699
a CoA allowed to be transferred from

1419
00:59:24,969 --> 00:59:30,309
distribution facility to distribution

1420
00:59:27,699 --> 00:59:34,409
facility the language in the BCC

1421
00:59:30,309 --> 00:59:37,179
regulation 503 seven there's one

1422
00:59:34,409 --> 00:59:39,429
sentence for this language and it needs

1423
00:59:37,179 --> 00:59:42,250
to be clarified can you tell me yes or

1424
00:59:39,429 --> 00:59:44,549
no if it can be transferred on the spot

1425
00:59:42,250 --> 00:59:46,329
right now that's why you're here

1426
00:59:44,550 --> 00:59:48,440
uncomfortable questions and a

1427
00:59:46,329 --> 00:59:54,519
comfortable environment

1428
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:54,519
[Laughter]

1429
00:59:55,519 --> 01:00:00,690
that's not that uncomfortable the

1430
00:59:58,260 --> 01:00:03,330
question I just want to make sure I give

1431
01:00:00,690 --> 01:00:05,760
you the right answer so I think think

1432
01:00:03,329 --> 01:00:07,469
that needs to be on our new FAQ system

1433
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:13,290
because we get that question all the

1434
01:00:07,469 --> 01:00:15,149
time so I will get your information and

1435
01:00:13,289 --> 01:00:16,650
we're gonna put that on the FAQ and

1436
01:00:15,150 --> 01:00:18,389
we're gonna email directly with the

1437
01:00:16,650 --> 01:00:20,849
answer and make sure it's the right

1438
01:00:18,389 --> 01:00:26,009

1442
01:00:31,349 --> 01:00:40,319
tell there's just a lot of fear we don't

1443

know we don't know if a dispensary is

1444
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:42,750
gonna ask us to take something off of

1445
01:00:41,670 --> 01:00:44,579
the shelf because of the way they're

1446
01:00:42,750 --> 01:00:46,320
interpreting one of your rules we don't

1447
01:00:44,579 --> 01:00:48,900
know if we're doing the right thing

1448

1455
01:00:59,699 --> 01:01:02,969
understand what enforcement will look

1456
01:01:01,289 --> 01:01:04,860
like as we figure it out

1457
01:01:02,969 --> 01:01:06,359
so the BCC I'm wondering if you guys

1458
01:01:04,860 --> 01:01:07,860
maybe just like don't need to be

1459
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:09,120
enforcing people who are trying to jump

1460
01:01:07,860 --> 01:01:11,070
through all these hoops right now and

1461
01:01:09,119 --> 01:01:14,159
instead you can just come and ask how

1462
01:01:11,070 --> 01:01:16,019
we're doing it and learn from us because

1463
01:01:14,159 --> 01:01:17,369
they're we're trying to do our best we

1464
01:01:16,019 --> 01:01:20,250
just jump through the hoops I don't

1465
01:01:17,369 --> 01:01:23,009
really understand why you're enforcing

1466
01:01:20,250 --> 01:01:25,289
dispensaries who are licensed right now

1467
01:01:23,010 --> 01:01:26,670
instead of saying let's walk through and

1468
01:01:25,289 --> 01:01:28,619
see how you're doing it let's take some

1469
01:01:26,670 --> 01:01:30,000
notes let's come back and say hey we

1470
01:01:28,619 --> 01:01:31,529
actually don't like this way let's do it

1471
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:33,269
differently but people shouldn't be

1472
01:01:31,530 --> 01:01:35,220
scared that if the time stamps off on

1473
01:01:33,269 --> 01:01:37,860
their receipt they're gonna get a fine

1474
01:01:35,219 --> 01:01:40,169
when they're trying to make payroll you

1475
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:41,880
know and some of these aren't my stories

1476
01:01:40,170 --> 01:01:45,530
but I'm in the middle of the supply

1477
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:45,530
chain and I have the fear of both from

1478
01:01:45,619 --> 01:01:52,109
so for the most part when we say

1479
01:01:48,860 --> 01:01:54,269
enforcing most of when we're going out

1480
01:01:52,110 --> 01:01:56,490
into the market probably the biggest

1481
01:01:54,269 --> 01:01:58,739
thing that we are enforcing is when we

1482
01:01:56,489 --> 01:02:00,479
come across product that hasn't come

1483
01:01:58,739 --> 01:02:01,589
through the legal supply chain so that's

1484
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:04,650
probably the biggest thing we're

1485
01:02:01,590 --> 01:02:07,350
enforcing other than that we are trying

1486
01:02:04,650 --> 01:02:07,530
to still educate our retailers I don't

1487
01:02:07,349 --> 01:02:10,039
know

1488
01:02:07,530 --> 01:02:12,690
Oh about a timestamp that sounds pretty

1489
01:02:10,039 --> 01:02:16,769
well that sounds sort of I give you a

1490
01:02:12,690 --> 01:02:18,090
ticket yeah let me give you one just

1491
01:02:16,769 --> 01:02:20,280
specific example because I think this

1492
01:02:18,090 --> 01:02:22,890
would help in the conversation around

1493
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:24,810
July 1st some people from BCC came to

1494
01:02:22,889 --> 01:02:26,009
one of our dispensaries SPARC and they

1495
01:02:24,809 --> 01:02:27,929
pointed out our packaging as

1496
01:02:26,010 --> 01:02:31,440
non-compliant but actually it was

1497
01:02:27,929 --> 01:02:33,659
compliant until July 1st and they add a

1498
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:35,639
spark got nervous since they pulled the

1499
01:02:33,659 --> 01:02:36,779
product during our last two weeks to

1500
01:02:35,639 --> 01:02:38,879
sell the product that would be

1501
01:02:36,780 --> 01:02:41,100
non-compliant July 1st because they

1502
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:42,960
flagged it and SPARC said just in case

1503
01:02:41,099 --> 01:02:44,610
we can't sell this and we said we have

1504
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:50,400
two more weeks as our last two weeks to

1505
01:02:44,610 --> 01:02:52,170
sell it and so just a summary is two

1506
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:53,639
constructive if you guys just came and

1507
01:02:52,170 --> 01:02:55,260
said hey we're learning right now we're

1508
01:02:53,639 --> 01:02:56,819
just gathering information and like

1509
01:02:55,260 --> 01:02:57,930
we're not concerned about the outcome of

1510
01:02:56,820 --> 01:02:59,670
what we're seeing right now because we

1511
01:02:57,929 --> 01:03:01,230
want to work with you to figure out

1512
01:02:59,670 --> 01:03:02,789
what's gonna work for both of us I think

1513
01:03:01,230 --> 01:03:03,990
that would go a really long way that

1514
01:03:02,789 --> 01:03:06,029
would have been a better approach a

1515
01:03:03,989 --> 01:03:08,250
really long way you're right yeah I mean

1516
01:03:06,030 --> 01:03:09,630
July 1 was crazy right I mean if we

1517
01:03:08,250 --> 01:03:11,909
think about what was happening around

1518
01:03:09,630 --> 01:03:13,800
that time we just feel like we are it's

1519
01:03:11,909 --> 01:03:15,420
like we are your partners and that we

1520
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:17,100
are learning together because neither of

1521
01:03:15,420 --> 01:03:18,659
us know how to do it we have to build it

1522
01:03:17,099 --> 01:03:20,579
together but we need your help to not be

1523
01:03:18,659 --> 01:03:23,219
scared of you I don't want you to be

1524
01:03:20,579 --> 01:03:24,090
scared of us and I think you're

1525
01:03:23,219 --> 01:03:27,539
absolutely right

1526
01:03:24,090 --> 01:03:30,059
July 1st last year was was was it was

1527
01:03:27,539 --> 01:03:31,230
very crazy I think we were all stressful

1528
01:03:30,059 --> 01:03:34,199
and that would have been a better

1529
01:03:31,230 --> 01:03:35,820
approach I agree with you but I think I

1530
01:03:34,199 --> 01:03:37,919
don't want to just hear about these

1531
01:03:35,820 --> 01:03:40,530
things when I come to the Meadowlands I

1532
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:43,019
want you to reach out to the bureau and

1533
01:03:40,530 --> 01:03:45,450
if it means you say forward this to

1534
01:03:43,019 --> 01:03:47,820
Laurie Ajax I want her to know I'm

1535
01:03:45,449 --> 01:03:51,719
saying I don't want you to be scared of

1536
01:03:47,820 --> 01:03:54,690
us but I I want to hear it before it's a

1537
01:03:51,719 --> 01:03:56,879
huge problem and and it's great I'm glad

1538
01:03:54,690 --> 01:03:58,980
you told me now but feel free to reach

1539
01:03:56,880 --> 01:04:00,660
out to us - oh I thinks I think that's

1540
01:03:58,980 --> 01:04:03,659
the best theme of this whole weekend has

1541
01:04:00,659 --> 01:04:09,409
just been let's talk more yes I love it

1542
01:04:03,659 --> 01:04:12,029
I love it yay that's good theme that's

1543
01:04:09,409 --> 01:04:13,920
just just because Reese Reese asked

1544
01:04:12,030 --> 01:04:15,810
about weed maps but we didn't really get

1545
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:17,730
over on whether or not anything was

1546
01:04:15,809 --> 01:04:20,969
gonna be done about that any times

1547
01:04:17,730 --> 01:04:25,849
they're recessed question

1548
01:04:20,969 --> 01:04:25,849
are you blaming it on her wait is it I

1549
01:04:26,300 --> 01:04:34,350
agree that weed maps as a problem and we

1550
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:36,840
should have Internet platforms that are

1551
01:04:34,349 --> 01:04:38,880
advertising for the license market not

1552
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:44,010
the unlicensed market and so we are

1553
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:46,470
committed as a state and to make sure

1554
01:04:44,010 --> 01:04:48,210
that those that aren't getting into

1555
01:04:46,469 --> 01:04:51,029
compliance we get them into compliance

1556
01:04:48,210 --> 01:04:52,500
and that would include wheat maps yeah I

1557
01:04:51,030 --> 01:04:54,180
mean if you're also like targeting

1558
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:57,420
people there's a list of people you can

1559
01:04:54,179 --> 01:04:59,460
go after if you want to just I don't

1560
01:04:57,420 --> 01:05:02,000
know that that's why we need weed maps

1561
01:04:59,460 --> 01:05:06,360
though but you're right you are right

1562
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:08,730
public anyway that was the end of the

1563
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:10,920
questions that would all the questions

1564
01:05:08,730 --> 01:05:13,230
we have thank you Laurie for your time

1565
