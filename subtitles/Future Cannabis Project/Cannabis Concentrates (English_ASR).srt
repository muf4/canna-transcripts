[Music]

2
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:15,159
[Music]

3
00:00:15,558 --> 00:00:20,239
to started out I figure they all come

4
00:00:17,719 --> 00:00:22,759
from different backgrounds of the

5
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:25,079
concentrate world so we'll just let them

6
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:27,480
each kind of give an intro and talk a

7
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:28,879
little bit about what they do and um

8
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,960
what they're focused on so we'll start

9
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:31,960
with you Frenchie

10
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:43,718
H so um all my knowledge of rine I learn

11
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:47,558
about it traveling the world and I spent

12
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:50,359
18 20 years of my life traveling and I

13
00:00:47,558 --> 00:00:54,119
spend plenty time in the producing

14
00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:54,920
country where I spend months living with

15
00:00:54,119 --> 00:01:01,198
a

16
00:00:54,920 --> 00:01:03,239
local making Ashish like really really

17
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:07,118
the the

18
00:01:03,238 --> 00:01:10,438
world concept behind it it's really

19
00:01:07,118 --> 00:01:15,959
picking up the wellness of the

20
00:01:10,438 --> 00:01:20,039
plant and uh I'm trying to bring the

21
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:22,719
traditional art into into

22
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,920
America trying to find the science

23
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:29,400
behind what these people I've been doing

24
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:32,519
for for thousand of years and that takes

25
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:35,680
a big time of my life otherwise I'm

26
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:39,039
totally dedicated to to the Emerald

27
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:42,040
Triangle because as a resine

28
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,040
specialist I am nobody if I don't get

29
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:46,200
the best

30
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:48,719
resin and I also believe that in the

31
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:51,799
Emerald Triangle you have something that

32
00:01:48,718 --> 00:01:54,438
is so unique that you can build up a

33
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:59,118
system like they exist in a wine

34
00:01:54,438 --> 00:02:03,758
industry where you can literally protect

35
00:01:59,118 --> 00:02:07,599
every small moment P grower because a 4

36
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:10,118
acre of land in champagne or in Bordeaux

37
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:13,039
it's a domain it's a chateau it's not

38
00:02:10,118 --> 00:02:16,360
for sale it's Priceless and this you

39
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:18,359
have it in emal Triangle you have you

40
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:21,560
have the terar you have the land that is

41
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:24,080
incredibly Rich you have hundred of

42
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:27,959
microclimate you have genetic that has

43
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:31,640
been here in in the norn part of the of

44
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:35,039
the emerald for two or three generation

45
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:38,000
and you have an economy that has been

46
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:40,199
alive for three generation and that are

47
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,759
feeding basically the world northern

48
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:45,238
part of California the future of

49
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:47,280
California come from them if you can

50
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:49,360
protect their land they're going to be

51
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,039
the center of a multi-billion dollar

52
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:55,959
industry and we have the blueprint in

53
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:58,280
history book in the in the wine

54
00:02:55,959 --> 00:03:00,840
industry thank you

55
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:03,759
Frankie very good

56
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:07,799
uh my name is Justin

57
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:10,399
pman with a PMP Laboratories uh PMP is

58
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:13,680
the acronym for purified metabolic

59
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:16,120
products and uh that is the goal when

60
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:19,120
you do purifications you know you want

61
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:21,400
to purify those metabolites using the

62
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:24,239
highest quality extraction equipment

63
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:27,879
along with the highest quality um

64
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:31,280
solvents and a lot of people that make

65
00:03:27,878 --> 00:03:34,239
BHO they are not using high quality

66
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:36,640
solvents they're using very easily

67
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:39,400
accessible solvents like over the-

68
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:43,000
counter aerosol based butanes or lighter

69
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:46,640
fluid and uh in science that is a big no

70
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:50,560
no um due to the mere fact that there's

71
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:53,000
a lot of U dangerous components that are

72
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,959
in those solvents and

73
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,318
um let's

74
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:00,239
see when it comes to uh even the

75
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:04,919
equipment that's being used you know a

76
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:09,680
lot of people they uh they are DIY they

77
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:12,639
make this uh recapturing equipment uh

78
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:16,560
out of refrigeration equipment and that

79
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:18,399
within itself is very dangerous and so

80
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,680
I've tried to bring about knowledge in

81
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:24,638
the community and other friends of mine

82
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:28,160
on the importance of starting correctly

83
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:30,960
and starting with pure products and uh

84
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:33,160
the importance of that

85
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:33,159
thank

86
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:41,719
you hi my name is Mara Gordon I'm the

87
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:44,360
founder of ant zeldas um we have been

88
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:49,120
working with concentrates with our

89
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:52,038
patients for about 5 years now and um we

90
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,800
even at one point had a CO2 machine and

91
00:04:52,038 --> 00:04:56,800
we were setting up the lab we were doing

92
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:57,759
it and we just didn't find the medicine

93
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,680
to be

94
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:02,840
as as aous as it could be for people

95
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,038
that were suffering with serious

96
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:07,799
illnesses we do in fact believe that

97
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:09,918
there's a place in the market for CO2 no

98
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:12,120
question about it butane I don't think

99
00:05:09,918 --> 00:05:14,399
there's a place for in the market I I

100
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:17,038
have our patients I say go ahead and

101
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:18,638
take this amazingly healthy diet go

102
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:21,000
ahead and eat all these unbelievably

103
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:23,680
wonderful Natural Foods I don't then

104
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,879
tell them to spray Pam on their on their

105
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,439
plates before they make their eggs I

106
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:29,319
wouldn't want them to be put in butane I

107
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:30,918
don't care how many parts per million

108
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:32,800
garbage garbage out you don't want to

109
00:05:30,918 --> 00:05:34,799
put poisons into your body when your

110
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,240
immune system is compromised your endoc

111
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,720
canabo system is not working efficiently

112
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,879
and you need to really ramp things up we

113
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:43,840
have made a commitment as an

114
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:47,000
organization to stick with ethanol the

115
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:49,318
190 ethanol the grain alcohol it works

116
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,639
incredible we have beautiful numbers our

117
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:54,120
medicines we we test each and every

118
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:56,519
single batch the results are

119
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:58,000
fantastic in the we have had incidents

120
00:05:56,519 --> 00:05:59,879
where we've had patients where we've had

121
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,478
to go to CO2 because we had to go to an

122
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:05,120
outside Source outside source with the

123
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:08,000
most incredible reputation we even use

124
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:10,038
the same flowers they do the CO2 we do

125
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
the ethanol and our patient didn't do as

126
00:06:10,038 --> 00:06:13,879
well so he's like you know what that's a

127
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,720
no-brainer this is all about the

128
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:17,839
patients this isn't about mass

129
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:20,800
production and though we are making a

130
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:23,839
heck of a lot of medicine and there's no

131
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:26,120
reason why we can't keep ramping up but

132
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:29,198
you don't have to go to costic

133
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:30,319
nonorganic nonnatural methods in order

134
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:33,038
to do that

135
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:35,840
we also have a commitment to not doing

136
00:06:33,038 --> 00:06:38,719
um we use a whole planed extract and so

137
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:40,478
that we don't uh strip everything out

138
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,720
through our processes and then add back

139
00:06:40,478 --> 00:06:44,120
in Turkey some people are doing that

140
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,599
there's a lot of call for that

141
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:49,759
especially in the Smoke Market but in

142
00:06:46,598 --> 00:06:51,439
the uh serious Medical Market definitely

143
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:54,720
don't recommend

144
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:54,719
it thank you

145
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:04,199

company uh with uh Vapor

149
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,800
devices um I'm Jason Beck I'm founder

and director of Alternative urbal Health

151

Services um we're the oldest dispensary

152
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:24,038
South of San Francisco in the state

153
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:26,918
stilling operation I started originally

154
00:07:24,038 --> 00:07:29,079
in 2001 in San Francisco and then the

155
00:07:26,918 --> 00:07:30,560
city of West Hollywood in 2004 asked me

156
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:32,359
to come down an open up off of a

157
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,439
recommendation from the Board of

158
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:36,840
Supervisors um I currently have the

159
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:39,199
largest selection of quality

160
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:41,279
concentrates in the entire State maybe

161
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:45,639
even the world as far as I'm concerned

162
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:48,638
at this point in time um so that's

163
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:51,000
pretty much it thank you Jason when I

164
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:53,120
started this I used the phrase resin

165
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,598
specialist and as we were discussing

166
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:58,360
this panel Frenchie brought up the

167
00:07:55,598 --> 00:08:00,478
importance of a common vocabulary so I

168
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:02,960
just wanted to ask him and the other

169
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:06,079
panelists if they'd like to chime in

170
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:08,439
what is the importance of using certain

171
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:10,800
vocabulary and what are some other words

172
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:13,918
that we should be using

173
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:18,079
Frenchie well to start with we don't

174
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:20,560
have a common word for unpressed resin

175
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:24,719
which is the material that every

176
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:28,199
everybody is using it's called it goes

177
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:30,360
under Min name from ke with a pretty

178
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:35,800
pejorative um

179
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:39,320
connotation to it to ice wax beach

180
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:43,120
sand and many other like this we really

181
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:46,040
need to be able to uh to Define every

182
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:50,200
aspect of what we do I do not extract

183
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:53,639
resin I collect it by saving it I'm not

184
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:57,160
an extractor they are and already this

185
00:08:53,639 --> 00:09:01,559
is something big for us we really need

186
00:08:57,159 --> 00:09:05,159
to to to use a common vocabulary to be

187
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:09,639
able to uh to teach people what we are

188
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:13,240
doing like we need to be able to have a

189
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:16,399
quality certification a way to uh to

190
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:21,079
show what is qu what is a quality in a

191
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:24,639
raisin to anybody who has no knowledge

192
00:09:21,078 --> 00:09:26,479
of it by by looking at The annotation of

193
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:29,399
somebody you should be able to

194
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:32,200
understand what that plant or what that

195
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:33,600
type of medicine can bring to you it's

196
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:36,120
like when we don't have a common

197
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:39,000
knowledge and there is a World Market

198
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:41,759
opening to us it's a little

199
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:45,120
sad I would like to say something um

200
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:47,519
even when it comes to BHO um I think

201
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:51,000
people need to really understand the

202
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:55,679
importance of using uh a lighter fluid

203
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:59,759
based solvent vers um a

204
00:09:55,679 --> 00:10:01,359
99.9% Purity solvent you know and that's

205
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:02,360
really big especially when it comes to

206
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,919
human

207
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:08,879
consumption you don't make a medicine by

208
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:11,199
starting with something that's used to

209
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:13,759
propel a motor down the

210
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:16,600
road nice I differentiate from from a

211
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:19,319
lot of that personally um I myself

212
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:21,759
suffer from cerebel paly myself just

213
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:23,560
first of all and and the reality of it

214
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:25,278
is that extractions need to be called

215
00:10:23,559 --> 00:10:27,838
exactly what they are and they're called

216
00:10:25,278 --> 00:10:29,720
Hy hydrocarbon extractions and that's

217
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,959
basically what it is it's used in pretty

218
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:34,360
much everything that you that you get

219
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:36,518
it's how coffee beans become

220
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:38,639
decaffeinated um it's how you extract

221
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:40,919
essential oils like lavender perfumes

222
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:43,120
things like that this is all the same

223
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:46,078
thing and all people really need to do

224
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:48,600
is stop open blasting and working with

225
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:50,199
quality Machinery that is actually made

226
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:52,759
to keep everything with

227
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:56,639
inside uh I mean Benzene is a

228
00:10:52,759 --> 00:11:00,200
hydrocarbon but it's also a carcinogen

229
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:03,278
uh I don't think they fall in this same

230
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:06,680
category my my my my thing with CO2 is

231
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:10,720
this is that when you do CO2 you have to

232
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:12,919
add in artificial tpin into CO2 in order

233
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:15,639
to give it a tpine profile because when

234
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:18,278
you blast with CO2 the turpine molecule

235
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:19,399
separates from the THC molecule so

236
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:20,838
that's why they have all these different

237
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:22,559
flavors and different things like that

238
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:25,000
and that's one of the main reasons that

239
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:28,000
I don't sell CO2 products is because of

240
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,759
that like CO2 I feel is great for

241
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,639
Edibles and things like that but as far

242
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:35,078
as for baking I'm not convinced on that

243
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:37,600
yet you asked a question about common

244
00:11:35,078 --> 00:11:40,159
vocabulary and I think the example here

245
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,120
is that and I think we're all not only

246
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:43,319
talking about different vocabulary we're

247
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:45,799
talking about different products and

248
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:48,399
different markets and different audience

249
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:51,120
completely so we call it

250
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:53,720
extracts and we are okay that we're but

251
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,519
we do extracts that's okay you know I I

252
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:57,600
was going to ask you because I actually

253
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:00,278
noticed on your website it said you

254
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,159
pulled the medicine from the plant and I

255
00:12:00,278 --> 00:12:05,639
was wondering if you were trying not to

256
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:07,360
use extract you do me yeah yes no we

257
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:10,639
absolutely have no problem using the

258
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:14,000
word extract we do extractions and

259
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:18,519
infusions we Infuse into like olive oil

260
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:21,320
or NC oil we in some ways you know like

261
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:24,278
when you make a a thca for example

262
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:27,079
there's ways of creating a thca we even

263
00:12:24,278 --> 00:12:29,198
Infuse that into an after it might start

264
00:12:27,078 --> 00:12:32,519
out in an alcohol as aure but it's going

265
00:12:29,198 --> 00:12:36,000
end up in an for proper dosing right I

266
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:38,799
so you do um it's organic organic grain

267
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,839
alcohol correct now and and you feel

268
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:44,519
that's the most efficient way to to pull

269
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:46,680
it out and my question is to pull the

270
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:49,839
medicine out my question is is that the

271
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:52,399
best way for to make extractions for all

272
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:54,959
uses um including like

273
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:58,360
smokeables do you believe I would say

274
00:12:54,958 --> 00:13:00,039
that the reason that the profiles of the

275
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:02,079
plants we've got you know there's people

276
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:04,039
that do it at home in their in their

277
00:13:02,078 --> 00:13:05,919
rice cookers or whatever it is they do

278
00:13:04,039 --> 00:13:07,599
that's not the same operation that we're

279
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:09,519
talking about it's not the same scale

280
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,600
it's not the same equipment it's not

281
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:14,679
it's a very much of an art form in

282
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:16,959
addition to um just the flat out

283
00:13:14,679 --> 00:13:19,278
extracting I me getting it decarbox

284
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:21,039
correctly to be to have your correct

285
00:13:19,278 --> 00:13:23,198
number of you know the you know do you

286
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:25,599
want to leave some thca in for example

287
00:13:23,198 --> 00:13:28,639
do you want it for a certain particular

288
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:30,600
uh designated use so for that the

289
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:33,680
profile that we end up with when we

290
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:36,079
extract using the Hy grain alcohol is

291
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:39,120
closest to the profile that what we see

292
00:13:36,078 --> 00:13:41,519
native in the flowers that we start with

293
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,198
and if we wanting to achieve something

294
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:46,000
with the plant that we bought we have

295
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:48,799
this flower we want it to be just a

296
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,240
concentrated version of that basically

297
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:53,559
in the medicine itself as far as we

298
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:57,240
actually think that the smokeables I

299
00:13:53,559 --> 00:14:00,078
mean I I do our medicine I smoke our

300
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:02,399
medicine you know same we into a syringe

301
00:14:00,078 --> 00:14:03,758
I might put into a vape cartridge that

302
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,360
doesn't mean that it's necessarily

303
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:07,399
correct for everybody and for every

304
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,399
Market but we're doing with very very

305
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:12,198
seriously ill people and we're creating

306
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:15,519
profiles we want to be able to do that

307
00:14:12,198 --> 00:14:17,719
using the the the Integrity of the plant

308
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:21,360
excellent um that leads me into a

309
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:24,320
question for Hunter so you have at w

310
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:26,278
Vapes a proprietary turine separation

311
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,079
process now I'm sure you're not going to

312
00:14:26,278 --> 00:14:29,480
give us all the details but um can you

313
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:30,879
tell us a little bit about that and then

314
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:33,839
it'll probably open the door for other

315
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:35,360
people to talk about tpin and well uh

316
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,440
going back to what he was talking about

317
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:40,399
I do agree with him with most of the CO2

318
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:42,560
oils on the market uh he's correct in

319
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:45,240
saying that but now with some advances

320
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:47,599
in technology uh you can fractionalize

321
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:50,198
the turpins off to the side postprocess

322
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:52,480
your oil uh and then reintroduce those

323
00:14:50,198 --> 00:14:54,519
turpins back into the oil giving it a

324
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:57,199
natural cannabis flavor that's really

325
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:59,360
really good and do you think that when

326
00:14:57,198 --> 00:15:02,319
you're adding tpin back in what what if

327
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:05,159
they're not from Cannabis how's the

328
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:07,199
panel feel about that it's artificial

329
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:09,278
yeah it's artificial food coloring yeah

330
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:12,159
it's like adding artificial flavor to

331
00:15:09,278 --> 00:15:14,480
your cereal so so everyone's in

332
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:17,120
agreement on that natural Canabis Tes

333
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:19,920
yeah so everybody out there starting a a

334
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,000
non-cannabis tpine company uh maybe not

335
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:24,120
do

336
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,440
that okay that's the kind of advice that

337
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:29,679
you'll get here quick question on that

338
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:31,680
though yes I mean it's aside from from

339
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:34,758
the Aesthetics and the marketing value

340
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:36,638
of having it be the same tpin from a

341
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:39,399
functional point of view are the Tarpin

342
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:41,680
from another plant different chemically

343
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:44,440
than the tpin you find in the marijuana

344
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:46,599
plant all tpin are the same in all plant

345
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:48,360
products it's the exact same turpine

346
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:50,440
profile that you'll get in a banana as

347
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:52,000
if you taste banana that taste flowers

348
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,880
like that it's the exact same turpine

349
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,318
profile I would have a little slightly

350
00:15:53,879 --> 00:15:59,120
different take on that um we also make a

351
00:15:56,318 --> 00:16:01,679
topical that contains 10 essential oils

352
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:03,039
and so I've done a lot of research on

353
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:04,879
and we're actually creating we're

354
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:06,599
starting some drug trials now on some

355
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:09,360
different things with our with this

356
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:12,278
particular topical it has in it

357
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:14,480
essential oils that come from various

358
00:16:12,278 --> 00:16:16,399
other plants that also have the same

359
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,560
resonant tpin that are within the

360
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:20,480
cannabis plant so we specifically chose

361
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:22,159
these for that reason but then you start

362
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,199
getting into the chemo type of the

363
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:26,360
essential oils like we talked about with

364
00:16:24,198 --> 00:16:28,439
our plants what elevation and was it

365
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,560
great was it grown at what was the light

366
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,000
it's going to change change everything

367
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:33,318
about the things with the plant well you

368
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,600
can look at for example Rosemary and if

369
00:16:33,318 --> 00:16:38,240
Rosemary is grown in one place versus

370
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,759
another place it might have more uh alap

371
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,720
pining in it another place that might

372
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:45,839
have more of another essential uh

373
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:48,519
turpine in there and so you have to

374
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:50,360
actually it's so much more complex than

375
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:52,000
just whatever is in a banana is in a

376
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:53,839
banana because then it depends on banana

377
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,399
where did that banana get grown you know

378
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:58,279
I've had a lot of bananas and they hav't

379
00:16:55,399 --> 00:17:01,198
all taste the same I think that's the

380
00:16:58,278 --> 00:17:03,439
beauty of cannabis you know is that it

381
00:17:01,198 --> 00:17:07,119
has the capability it Jean Pool is so

382
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:11,120
big to produce so many tpin and banana

383
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:13,000
flavored vanilla flavored skunk you know

384
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:16,838
the list goes on and

385
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:19,599
on it's just and those are other things

386
00:17:16,838 --> 00:17:23,078
that occur in nature as well you know

387
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:25,558
like the skunk pherone or the smell that

388
00:17:23,078 --> 00:17:29,119
it produces there are strains out there

389
00:17:25,558 --> 00:17:31,839
that very similar you know and it's you

390
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:34,918
if you were to classify the molecule

391
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:38,678
they more than likely are the same

392
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:40,559
thing there is no scientific study that

393
00:17:38,679 --> 00:17:43,720
have actually tried to make the

394
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:46,879
difference between terpen say lemon

395
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:51,600
coming from different

396
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:51,600
plant but at the same

397
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:57,839
times why would you lose the terpen in

398
00:17:55,119 --> 00:18:01,119
the first place when you are an

399
00:17:57,839 --> 00:18:03,839
extractor especially when you use CO2

400
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:07,199
and BHO machine that's machine that I

401
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:10,839
use in industry in the perfume industry

402
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:14,519
to pick up the most volatile

403
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:17,558
terpan so if from the beginning you lose

404
00:18:14,519 --> 00:18:20,879
the terpen the game is over the plant is

405
00:18:17,558 --> 00:18:23,519
all about terpen cannabinoid is a teren

406
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:26,280
compound cannabinoid are made by the

407
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:30,759
bounding of two molecule terpen and

408
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:30,759
phenol you lose terpen the game is over

409
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:38,240
I think you know like in the future I I

410
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:41,879
think if harvesting

411
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:44,519
tpin becomes something that be that

412
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:48,679
gains popularity I think there will be

413
00:18:44,519 --> 00:18:51,759
other methods besides BHO and CO2

414
00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:54,519
extractions you know these are voc's

415
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:57,440
these are compounds that naturally are

416
00:18:54,519 --> 00:19:00,119
volatile at room temperature and just

417
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:03,519
under vacuum and you know having a cold

418
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:06,519
trap you can Harvest

419
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:08,558
them we have uh one of our extract

420
00:19:06,519 --> 00:19:11,240
artist they have uh one in particular

421
00:19:08,558 --> 00:19:13,599
line that's called uh Divine thorium it

422
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:16,279
means divine flower in Latin and that

423
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:19,719
whole line is all blast when it's

424
00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:22,759
blasted it is blasted with actual like

425
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:24,880
lemon rind strawberries things like that

426
00:19:22,759 --> 00:19:27,359
with the Cannabis and actually enhances

427
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:29,000
the turpine profile afterwards on your

428
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:30,839
after hit so then in the after after hit

429
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,440
you taste all strawberry or you taste

430
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:35,158
all that and because that's all a

431
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:37,080
natural tpping it can all be mixed like

432
00:19:35,159 --> 00:19:38,960
that

433
00:19:37,079 --> 00:19:41,119
interesting yeah so when we were

434
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,880
discussing this panel also uh Frenchie

435
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:46,000
brought up an important point about

436
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:47,000
relationships between cultivators and

437
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,720
and

438
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,440
concentrate manufacturers so I wanted to

439
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:53,440
see if uh you could talk a little about

440
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,919
that and then I'd like to expand on it

441
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,960
and say uh maybe for Jason how about the

442
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:00,720
relationship between the concentrate

443
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:04,200
makers and the dispensary and then to

444
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:06,360
Justin how about concentrate uh makers

445
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,960
and the manufacturers of the equipment

446
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:09,959
and basically how can we strengthen

447
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:12,159
those relationships and and anyone else

448
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:17,000
can chime in as

449
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:22,960
well so I work with a small Seed Company

450
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:27,000
in uh in mandino aish seed and the Ash

451
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:31,000
is actually a promoting tool for the

452
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:33,159
genetic you don't look hardly at resin

453
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:36,119
when you look at flower for me it's the

454
00:20:33,159 --> 00:20:39,280
opposite I never looked at flower so

455
00:20:36,119 --> 00:20:41,678
everything is about the resin so that

456
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:44,519
when you bring genetic to somebody and

457
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:47,038
you can show the flower and you show

458
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:49,720
actually the resin that is growing on

459
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:53,119
that flower it has a very very strong

460
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:55,200
impact you can use the ash to promote a

461
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:57,918
line of flower even before you bring it

462
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:00,600
on the market and also I'm a quality

463
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:04,320
control it's like any genetic who

464
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:08,119
doesn't pass the ash test it has to be

465
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:10,399
breeded longer or one who really show a

466
00:21:08,119 --> 00:21:14,558
lot in a resin that should have been

467
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:17,360
stopped is brought back it's like I um

468
00:21:14,558 --> 00:21:21,359
I'm the wine maker and I work with with

469
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:23,479
a a Vine grower so my relation with them

470
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:27,519
we share everything everything that

471
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:31,200
happened to me happened to them and I

472
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:35,038
receive the love and dedication of

473
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:37,919
months of art labor my tri everything

474
00:21:35,038 --> 00:21:42,720
that come in my hand I've been treated

475
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:45,679
like uh the little beauty they are from

476
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:49,839
the moment they put the seed in the soil

477
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:51,919
to when it come in my hand

478
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:57,519
and I'm

479
00:21:51,919 --> 00:22:00,799
only collecting the the expression of a

480
00:21:57,519 --> 00:22:03,720
lot of work and dedication and because I

481
00:22:00,798 --> 00:22:08,639
can create a relation like like this it

482
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:12,360
goes beyond buying Tri we work together

483
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:15,000
and we're trying to not only to show the

484
00:22:12,359 --> 00:22:17,839
potential of the genetic because I work

485
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:21,240
with Elite heirloom genetic that have

486
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:24,480
been living in uh in the three state up

487
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:25,880
North for three or four generation it's

488
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:30,240
like I

489
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:32,880
can I'm the person between the plant and

490
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:35,558
and the patient that bring really the

491
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:38,000
full expression of that plant to the

492
00:22:35,558 --> 00:22:41,839
people it's

493
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:44,640
like keeping the purity of it especially

494
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:47,639
when the plant are growing in two places

495
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:51,080
that it's all the terar she was talking

496
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:54,120
about plant giving different aspect of

497
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:57,720
herself growing in different place I can

498
00:22:54,119 --> 00:23:00,599
tell you that up north they have a Tero

499
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:03,200
that is very unique as good as in the

500
00:23:00,599 --> 00:23:06,079
Himalaya where when you change valy you

501
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:08,558
can really feel a difference between

502
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:12,558
between the genetic even if it's the

503
00:23:08,558 --> 00:23:15,399
same genetic this is what I have working

504
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:18,079
in a close close relationship with

505
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:21,278
grower they give me they give me the

506
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:24,240
land they give me that all those months

507
00:23:21,278 --> 00:23:29,798
and dedication and this is what I have

508
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:34,319
to uh to keep as pure as as possible

509
00:23:29,798 --> 00:23:38,158
nice uh as a direct connection between

510
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:40,798
concentrate makers and Equipment

511
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:44,400
manufacturers uh they're one and the

512
00:23:40,798 --> 00:23:47,519
same in a lot of ways uh you know the

513
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:51,159
the market for BHO if you rewind five

514
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:54,798
years ago it was very common to use a

515
00:23:51,159 --> 00:23:57,240
aerosol base and PVC pipe and that

516
00:23:54,798 --> 00:24:01,240
material was winning canvas cups left

517
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:03,679
and right and uh as time had gone on and

518
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:05,278
you know then people want shatter they

519
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:07,640
want honeycomb you know and there's

520
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:10,759
these trends that happen in the market

521
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:12,759
and then now nowadays you know if you're

522
00:24:10,759 --> 00:24:15,119
if you're not using a Clos loop

523
00:24:12,759 --> 00:24:17,119
extraction equipment and you know you're

524
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:18,759
still open blasting you're frowned upon

525
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:22,038
in the market which you should be

526
00:24:18,759 --> 00:24:26,440
because that's very dangerous and uh now

527
00:24:22,038 --> 00:24:28,640
dewaxing is come into play and it's it's

528
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:31,360
it's growing fast you know and it's it's

529
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:34,600
constantly changing and even like the

530
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:37,199
components you know people are realizing

531
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:40,319
that you shouldn't be using like pipe

532
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:42,480
thread or you know like and refrigerant

533
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:45,000
equipment like these are just frowned

534
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:49,000
upon things you know about there's a lot

535
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:52,720
of DIY people in the industry so and you

536
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:56,038
know if you're a farmer and you have

537
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:58,120
trim that's a viable product you want to

538
00:24:56,038 --> 00:25:00,079
make it you you don't want to harvest

539
00:24:58,119 --> 00:25:02,879
that for what it is but you don't see

540
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:05,079
people out there buying trim to roll

541
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:08,200
into joints or you know they're using it

542
00:25:05,079 --> 00:25:11,879
to make extract so it's

543
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:15,038
like yeah I think both markets are

544
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:17,399
feeding each other you know and they are

545
00:25:15,038 --> 00:25:19,519
are going to be you know well it would

546
00:25:17,398 --> 00:25:22,000
seem that they're then really relying on

547
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:24,240
you to keep them up to date on the best

548
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,159
practices and the best equipment which I

549
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:29,919
think all patients uh we should be we

550
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:32,480
should be happy for that so so thank

551
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:36,000
you Jason were you going to as far as

552
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:38,759
from the from the store aspect um I'm

553
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:41,919
really big on only working with name

554
00:25:38,759 --> 00:25:44,519
brand concentrate companies as far as

555
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:46,679
you have to be really branding yourself

556
00:25:44,519 --> 00:25:48,319
and putting as much effort into selling

557
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:51,798
your product as much as I'm putting

558
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:53,678
effort into selling your product so and

559
00:25:51,798 --> 00:25:55,599
with that said that helps a lot with the

560
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:57,200
quality control because anyone that's

561
00:25:55,599 --> 00:25:58,879
creating a real brand and really trying

562
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,960
to be in this business is not going to

563
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,840
be in the in any interest of wanting to

564
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:05,319
harm people or creating a bad product in

565
00:26:02,839 --> 00:26:07,079
the first place and so by working with

566
00:26:05,319 --> 00:26:09,278
quality Brands and quality things like

567
00:26:07,079 --> 00:26:12,319
that I Source numerous flowers for

568
00:26:09,278 --> 00:26:15,000
numerous extract companies constantly

569
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:16,480
and it's it's basically it's all about

570
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,159
if you got good going in you're going to

571
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,319
get good coming out if you got trash

572
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:21,559
going in you're going to have trash

573
00:26:19,319 --> 00:26:21,558
coming

574
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:27,159
out nice um did oh go ahead I I mean I

575
00:26:25,398 --> 00:26:28,839
kind of wanted to comment on that I

576
00:26:27,159 --> 00:26:32,559
think that there's a lot of people out

577
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:35,240
there making uh you know

578
00:26:32,558 --> 00:26:37,038
butane uh related products that aren't

579
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:39,919
in the Limelight because you're

580
00:26:37,038 --> 00:26:41,798
manufacturing a narcotic and they don't

581
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:43,679
tend to be in the Limelight you know

582
00:26:41,798 --> 00:26:45,839
they don't want to Market themselves

583
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:47,798
they're not brand so they may they may

584
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:50,119
be selling their products to other

585
00:26:47,798 --> 00:26:52,200
brands I I just I agree with you I

586
00:26:50,119 --> 00:26:54,239
disagree they are Brands they're just

587
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:56,798
putting their energy somewhere other

588
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,679
than just selling a lot of stuff they're

589
00:26:56,798 --> 00:27:01,319
putting it into R&amp;D they're putting it

590
00:26:58,679 --> 00:27:02,720
into taking care of sick people they're

591
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:04,240
putting it into giving away free

592
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:07,120
medicines where necessary they're

593
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:09,200
putting it into paying out through the

594
00:27:07,119 --> 00:27:11,719
NOS through lawyers and accountants to

595
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:14,558
be compliant and to be doing the right

596
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:17,519
thing branding is a is a business

597
00:27:14,558 --> 00:27:20,158
strategy making good medicine is a

598
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:21,798
science I I agree with exactly the end

599
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:24,559
point of what you're saying the end

600
00:27:21,798 --> 00:27:27,839
point making making quality meds is a

601
00:27:24,558 --> 00:27:29,558
science 100% and that's why these Brands

602
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:31,398
make some of the best medicine and then

603
00:27:29,558 --> 00:27:33,480
they turn it into a brand so then that

604
00:27:31,398 --> 00:27:36,439
way it's notorized people know it people

605
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:38,599
know the name these Brands win cups you

606
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:40,720
know what I mean this it's just how the

607
00:27:38,599 --> 00:27:42,558
market how market share works as you can

608
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:45,000
see there's no controversy in

609
00:27:42,558 --> 00:27:47,639
concentrates by the way so we don't have

610
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,440
to worry about that um well so that

611
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:51,080
brings up another point we you know we

612
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:54,200
have these state regulations on the

613
00:27:51,079 --> 00:27:57,439
horizon um concentrate manufacturing has

614
00:27:54,200 --> 00:28:01,159
been and is basically illegal um in in

615
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:04,120
the state and so are there are there um

616
00:28:01,159 --> 00:28:06,880
concentrate associations being formed

617
00:28:04,119 --> 00:28:08,879
are there uh are there what is the

618
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:11,320
concentrate world doing as far as to get

619
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:14,360
involved with the legislation I'll let

620
00:28:11,319 --> 00:28:14,359
anybody speak on

621
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:21,038
that I I can I can speak for thei and

622
00:28:18,519 --> 00:28:23,839
we're trying to make a a guild

623
00:28:21,038 --> 00:28:27,440
Association to be able to uh to know

624
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:28,678
what we're doing isia from the emerald

625
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:32,278
grower associ

626
00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:35,320
assciation uh is the person in in charge

627
00:28:32,278 --> 00:28:39,159
we have been talking about it for for a

628
00:28:35,319 --> 00:28:42,558
year because as I was saying as a as a

629
00:28:39,159 --> 00:28:46,519
ashin everything come from your Growers

630
00:28:42,558 --> 00:28:50,079
that means that for us as a ash maker or

631
00:28:46,519 --> 00:28:52,798
anybody touching the resin in any way

632
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:54,599
the only things we have to think about

633
00:28:52,798 --> 00:28:58,158
it's protecting our grower and

634
00:28:54,599 --> 00:29:01,798
protecting the the land literally Beyond

635
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:04,919
on that uh this is the beginning if we

636
00:29:01,798 --> 00:29:04,918
don't have that there is

637
00:29:05,798 --> 00:29:09,960
nothing I thought there was this

638
00:29:08,398 --> 00:29:15,439
company

639
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:17,519
cersa uh I I may be murdering it but I

640
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:21,759
believe at one point reading about it I

641
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:23,919
wrote them um I didn't get a response

642
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:26,398
from the email they're an association I

643
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:29,880
believe so yeah I was looking it up yeah

644
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:31,759
s sersa that's a uh deor group nice yeah

645
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:33,360
cersa they the group up north that are

646
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:36,519
trying to lobby for

647
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:38,359
concentrates um other than that I work

648
00:29:36,519 --> 00:29:39,720
with CIA I'm one of the executive

649
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:42,240
directors down here for Southern

650
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:44,360
California and so we work more on a

651
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:46,960
local level more than on a Statewide

652
00:29:44,359 --> 00:29:49,240
level because at the end of the day you

653
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:51,120
need to get a local ordinance passed

654
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:53,278
especially in with how the new framework

655
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:56,558
of how this law works is you have to

656
00:29:53,278 --> 00:30:00,079
have local sanctification for extraction

657
00:29:56,558 --> 00:30:03,398
not just state approval stay licens I

658
00:30:00,079 --> 00:30:06,960
work witha American Products

659
00:30:03,398 --> 00:30:09,558
Association and we're treating Canabis

660
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:12,038
extracts just like any other herbal

661
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:14,319
extract but with a whole heck of a lot

662
00:30:12,038 --> 00:30:16,480
of safeties put in there protections

663
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:18,879
because of you know the fears around

664
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:20,519
harm to given and taken the wrong way

665
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,320
you might not die for it but you sure

666
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:23,919
might feel like you wish you would for a

667
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:26,480
few hours and nobody should have to go

668
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:28,799
through that so we're working on all the

669
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:31,919
things around labeling and processing

670
00:30:28,798 --> 00:30:33,519
and distribution and storage and Etc so

671
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:35,480
everything that you can think of Soup To

672
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:37,240
Nuts on this we're creating all the

673
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:39,960
guidelines so that we can then present

674
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:41,759
these to the various um you know

675
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:44,120
legislative groups and say here we've

676
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:46,759
already done this here this is how we're

677
00:30:44,119 --> 00:30:48,599
self-regulating we want you to adopt

678
00:30:46,759 --> 00:30:49,720
this because we were already we're being

679
00:30:48,599 --> 00:30:52,319
harder on

680
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:54,399
ourselves great excellent that point

681
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:56,599
just pull up I've heard a lot of people

682
00:30:54,398 --> 00:30:59,158
say there's been a huge farmal Lobby

683
00:30:56,599 --> 00:31:01,359
going in place for when this becomes

684
00:30:59,159 --> 00:31:03,360
more ferally legalized and the

685
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:05,479
restrictions that may come in especially

686
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:06,798
around exra because there arguments that

687
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:08,679
you're taking a plant you're taking

688
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:10,319
something out of that and you're doing

689
00:31:08,679 --> 00:31:12,399
something similar to Farmer what what do

690
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:14,678
you think do you think that that's a

691
00:31:12,398 --> 00:31:16,479
real risk in the cluster space I think

692
00:31:14,679 --> 00:31:18,600
that it's a very big risk in the entire

693
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:21,000
industry and I think that the more that

694
00:31:18,599 --> 00:31:23,158
we can do to collaborate and work

695
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,679
together and make sure that we self

696
00:31:23,159 --> 00:31:28,080
self-regulate and that we have outside

697
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:29,559
independent you know adjudication just

698
00:31:28,079 --> 00:31:31,519
make sure that we're doing it all

699
00:31:29,558 --> 00:31:33,440
correctly and we can show that we're

700
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:35,519
putting all the efforts together to to

701
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:37,759
do that and test it and everything and

702
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:40,558
testing testing testing testing test

703
00:31:37,759 --> 00:31:42,679
every batch test it again retest it get

704
00:31:40,558 --> 00:31:44,558
the machines better get the the

705
00:31:42,679 --> 00:31:46,600
technicians better but do you think

706
00:31:44,558 --> 00:31:47,480
there will eventually be like a strong

707
00:31:46,599 --> 00:31:50,959
hand in

708
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:53,000
the well as long as we we are doing

709
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:55,079
everything we can to keep this an herbal

710
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:58,359
product because if you're not dealing

711
00:31:55,079 --> 00:32:00,879
with isol that you know standardized

712
00:31:58,359 --> 00:32:04,000
pharmacology is about reductionism it's

713
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:05,919
about single molecule drugs that you can

714
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:09,200
dose you say you know you have 25

715
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:10,880
milligram and 25 Mig of X with what

716
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,600
we're dealing with is so much more

717
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:15,000
complex than that so we have to treat it

718
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:16,678
as an herbal product on the other hand

719
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,398
we're going to Spain now to start drug

720
00:32:16,679 --> 00:32:21,919
trials with Guzman and Sanchez and we're

721
00:32:19,398 --> 00:32:24,879
going to be taking using extracts full

722
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:29,399
plant extracts to be doing studies on

723
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:31,519
Cell lines or glol blastoma or to breast

724
00:32:29,398 --> 00:32:33,359
cancer we're looking at the swamis and

725
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:35,759
the basal cell and we're using full

726
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:37,558
planned extracts so we want to show that

727
00:32:35,759 --> 00:32:39,240
if you get it down and you know what

728
00:32:37,558 --> 00:32:41,398
you're doing you don't have to get those

729
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:43,079
little single isolates and without

730
00:32:41,398 --> 00:32:46,199
pharmaceutical companies don't have a

731
00:32:43,079 --> 00:32:47,638
way to stand up well into that you work

732
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:49,798
with the American herbal products

733
00:32:47,638 --> 00:32:51,879
Association and that's exactly what they

734
00:32:49,798 --> 00:32:54,440
do and what they've been doing for a

735
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:56,399
decade or so is keeping herbal

736
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:58,919
supplements right out of the hands of

737
00:32:56,398 --> 00:33:01,959
the FDA when they don't need to be so

738
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:03,320
that's why APPA is so important um I

739
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:05,120
actually have no idea how we're doing on

740
00:33:03,319 --> 00:33:07,599
time but I think it's time to go to

741
00:33:05,119 --> 00:33:09,599
questions so if anyone has questions out

742
00:33:07,599 --> 00:33:14,240
there

743
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:18,158
Obie my understanding is that in Europe

744
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:20,440
smoking flowers is considered crude

745
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:24,120
that's not the end product the end

746
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:27,960
product is the hatch and in the United

747
00:33:24,119 --> 00:33:30,918
States my understanding is that flowers

748
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:33,360
for many people is considered the endend

749
00:33:30,919 --> 00:33:38,840
product Aaron you're the consumate

750
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:41,278
marketer comment on that okay so um I'm

751
00:33:38,839 --> 00:33:43,759
on the panel now that's cool um no

752
00:33:41,278 --> 00:33:46,079
that's good um yeah well we are a

753
00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:48,278
company that specializes in high quality

754
00:33:46,079 --> 00:33:50,638
flowers um I know it's kind of going

755
00:33:48,278 --> 00:33:52,919
against the trend but that is something

756
00:33:50,638 --> 00:33:56,918
that myself and my head cultivator Tyler

757
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:59,919
Wadley here uh really focus on so for a

758
00:33:56,919 --> 00:34:01,840
lot of our Pati um it's about the flour

759
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:03,880
but we have plenty of concentrates and

760
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:05,918
like these concentrate manufacturers

761
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:07,159
have said um it all starts with the

762
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:10,000
plant

763
00:34:07,159 --> 00:34:11,760
so definitely the trend is going to more

764
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,440
and more concentrates and like you said

765
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:16,399
hash is probably the finished product

766
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:18,760
but there's something to the flower for

767
00:34:16,398 --> 00:34:21,279
me personally where I feel the full

768
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:23,800
effect um and it would be really similar

769
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:26,399
with with Frenchies hash um but when you

770
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:30,760
take that away from me um it's just not

771
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:32,960
the same whether it's BHO Co CO2 I I'm

772
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:35,800
looking for um more of an effect

773
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:38,159
personally so who knows I think people

774
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:39,879
will you know sometimes you take a dab

775
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:42,159
sometimes you smoke a joint it's more

776
00:34:39,878 --> 00:34:43,918
more of a generational thing too now you

777
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:45,639
know what I mean like call me old yeah

778
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:47,679
this the the the younger the younger

779
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:49,119
generation is all like all about the

780
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:50,079
concentrates that's that's their whole

781
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:51,399
thing you're going to have a whole

782
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:53,639
generation of kids that have never

783
00:34:51,398 --> 00:34:58,279
smoked flowers pretty much and that's

784
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:59,960
really what it is uh I mean

785
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:03,280
when I was in college I went to college

786
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:04,800
with Europeans who they smuggle hash

787
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:07,560
over here and they would roll their

788
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:09,000
little joints with the tobacco and you

789
00:35:07,559 --> 00:35:11,960
know you turn them on into some

790
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:15,800
high-grade Sour Diesel and they're like

791
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:18,679
wow do you want my hash yeah I mean I I

792
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:20,519
I will say that uh trade trade trade

793
00:35:18,679 --> 00:35:22,279
yeah I I would say that a lot of times

794
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:24,679
we get a lot of love from people who

795
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:27,480
usually don't smoke flowers um because

796
00:35:24,679 --> 00:35:29,799
we produce a really clean smooth flour

797
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:31,400
and I think if there were more of that

798
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:34,079
um you would see more of these people

799
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:36,160
using it but so much of the Cannabis um

800
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:38,920
does hurt your throat and is not flush

801
00:35:36,159 --> 00:35:41,719
properly so you know that is an

802
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:43,800
issue right there is anybody up there

803
00:35:41,719 --> 00:35:46,439
noticing a trend where extractors are

804
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:49,240
moving away from using mainly just trim

805
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:51,519
and Sugar Leaf and extracting from Whole

806
00:35:49,239 --> 00:35:55,479
flowers most of the people I know all do

807
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:57,759
Nug Run um trim is more of a economical

808
00:35:55,480 --> 00:36:00,240
thing but but a majority of my concent

809
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:02,440
rates are all nugrun and and your

810
00:36:00,239 --> 00:36:03,838
patients because your patients want that

811
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:06,240
correct yeah that's that that's what a

812
00:36:03,838 --> 00:36:07,880
majority of them want and and I've I've

813
00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:10,239
cuz I've had storees since 01 I've

814
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:12,079
always sold concentrates back when only

815
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:14,479
concentrates were only called ear wax

816
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:16,160
honeycomb amber glass Amber shards and

817
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,679
now the only thing that's different is

818
00:36:16,159 --> 00:36:19,199
the marketing and the different

819
00:36:17,679 --> 00:36:20,358
techniques and the different devices and

820
00:36:19,199 --> 00:36:23,719
the different companies that have come

821
00:36:20,358 --> 00:36:28,519
out to help help brand the market

822
00:36:23,719 --> 00:36:33,118
share I uh I think that it's a marketing

823
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:37,358
thing um I think whether you're uh

824
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:39,838
purifying metabolites from uh trim or

825
00:36:37,358 --> 00:36:42,039
from flow you know as long as those

826
00:36:39,838 --> 00:36:46,639
glands are present and there is some

827
00:36:42,039 --> 00:36:48,759
type of um cannaboids in there then it

828
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:50,879
doesn't really matter your yields will

829
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:54,480
be different and maybe the tpine

830
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:58,000
concentration will be slightly off but

831
00:36:54,480 --> 00:37:00,119
it you know it is an economical thing

832
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,318
but if you know if you're in a contest

833
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:05,200
or something then I would suggest using

834
00:37:02,318 --> 00:37:06,759
flowers but besides that I think it

835
00:37:05,199 --> 00:37:10,358
could be a waste of

836
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:13,640
money we use we use flowers but

837
00:37:10,358 --> 00:37:15,838
sometimes we'll get some popcorn but

838
00:37:13,639 --> 00:37:17,639
it's still pretty good but even before

839
00:37:15,838 --> 00:37:19,559
we'll use it though we'll always keep

840
00:37:17,639 --> 00:37:20,879
that out we will not use it in its

841
00:37:19,559 --> 00:37:23,159
present form we'll make sure that we

842
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:24,680
remove as much of the plant matter as we

843
00:37:23,159 --> 00:37:26,759
can not that there's going to be much in

844
00:37:24,679 --> 00:37:29,358
popcorn popcorn has to have some nugs in

845
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:33,079
there to some real nuts but we

846
00:37:29,358 --> 00:37:35,799
definitely use uh flowers then the a lot

847
00:37:33,079 --> 00:37:38,599
of what you see in the edible industry

848
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:40,280
is the trend that goes for that I don't

849
00:37:38,599 --> 00:37:41,800
understand why anybody thinks that if it

850
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:43,160
goes through a different mechanism

851
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:46,119
through the body it doesn't matter if

852
00:37:43,159 --> 00:37:48,960
it's as healthy uh to me it's it's all

853
00:37:46,119 --> 00:37:52,160
going in it all needs to go in healthy

854
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:55,000
but um too many times I've seen the trim

855
00:37:52,159 --> 00:37:56,759
that I've looked at and seen where it's

856
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:59,519
like after they do their they have their

857
00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:01,160
trimmers there all day um not wearing

858
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:02,679
masks not wearing gloves not wearing

859
00:38:01,159 --> 00:38:04,719
whatever they'll come in and they'll

860
00:38:02,679 --> 00:38:06,838
just scoop upet off the floor sweep the

861
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:09,118
floor put that in big giant Hefty bags

862
00:38:06,838 --> 00:38:11,679
and then sell that for 50 bucks or 100

863
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:13,640
bucks to some processor that's not

864
00:38:11,679 --> 00:38:16,799
really what I want in my

865
00:38:13,639 --> 00:38:20,239
medicine no it's like they they would TR

866
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:23,440
treat small birds the same it's it's not

867
00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:27,279
really what you use of the plant because

868
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:29,240
the Trion on the sugar trim are as good

869
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:34,319
as a Trion on the

870
00:38:29,239 --> 00:38:37,879
head but it's the way your Tri have your

871
00:38:34,318 --> 00:38:41,358
material has been treated between the

872
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:44,519
Harvest and you that's why your relation

873
00:38:41,358 --> 00:38:49,719
with the grower is so important because

874
00:38:44,519 --> 00:38:54,039
my quality of Ash is the quality of

875
00:38:49,719 --> 00:38:57,959
afishionado it's not my ash I represent

876
00:38:54,039 --> 00:39:02,559
aish it's just made by me so so now it's

877
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:04,880
a question of for those grower they want

878
00:39:02,559 --> 00:39:08,039
their reputation to stay high we have a

879
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:10,838
very small industry you cannot make any

880
00:39:08,039 --> 00:39:14,838
mistake especially when you're a breeder

881
00:39:10,838 --> 00:39:17,480
and they wouldn't give me anything but

882
00:39:14,838 --> 00:39:20,400
the best when you have sugar trim left

883
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:22,960
in the plastic bag just by itself the

884
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:25,920
weight of the trim they're so sticky

885
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:30,358
that when I open it at home I can put a

886
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:34,079
coffee a full cup of coffee on it in

887
00:39:30,358 --> 00:39:37,838
full confidence like not feeling afraid

888
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:41,760
at all and take picture of it this is

889
00:39:37,838 --> 00:39:44,239
just sugar trim but this is the best of

890
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:46,599
the sugar trim that I've been treated

891
00:39:44,239 --> 00:39:49,199
the same way that the flower have been

892
00:39:46,599 --> 00:39:52,119
treated that's why you need that

893
00:39:49,199 --> 00:39:54,879
relation of the grower because I know

894
00:39:52,119 --> 00:39:57,480
that my medicine is organic I know where

895
00:39:54,880 --> 00:40:00,760
it's grown I know it's been taken care

896
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:04,000
in between all my resin is cured or

897
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:07,720
fresh I know everything about what I do

898
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:11,358
because it's so concentrate thein at the

899
00:40:07,719 --> 00:40:13,919
end that anything that is wrong is going

900
00:40:11,358 --> 00:40:16,400
to show even more so here it's like if

901
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:20,639
you have any

902
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:23,720
pesticide uh and you don't have somebody

903
00:40:20,639 --> 00:40:26,078
checking your plant to tell you that yes

904
00:40:23,719 --> 00:40:28,000
now you at the end of the flower season

905
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:30,318
there is no more pesticide

906
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:34,559
about it if you don't have

907
00:40:30,318 --> 00:40:37,800
that trust toward your grower you never

908
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:37,799
know the medicine you're giving

909
00:40:38,559 --> 00:40:43,279
away um one other question oh are we

910
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:49,960
done now how about uh concentrate that

911
00:40:47,079 --> 00:40:52,920
comes from sungrown cannabis versus

912
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:55,838
indoor cannabis is there a difference

913
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:57,358
and what is the difference all right

914
00:40:55,838 --> 00:41:01,759
taste

915
00:40:57,358 --> 00:41:04,078
taste yield quality price point color

916
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:06,319
all of these different things all all

917
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:08,519
will come into play with all of these

918
00:41:06,318 --> 00:41:10,679
concentrates and when you are working

919
00:41:08,519 --> 00:41:13,920
with outdoor and Greenhouse your numbers

920
00:41:10,679 --> 00:41:16,118
are a lot larger so there's a fine

921
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:17,920
timeline from when you can process those

922
00:41:16,119 --> 00:41:19,559
plants to when they will actually go bad

923
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:22,680
and you will actually produce bad

924
00:41:19,559 --> 00:41:24,400
product because the the the turpenoid or

925
00:41:22,679 --> 00:41:25,919
the excuse me the tricomes have already

926
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:29,720
amber colored so you're going to come

927
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:31,119
out with dark so the reality of it is

928
00:41:29,719 --> 00:41:32,879
you better be able to pump it if you're

929
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:37,440
going to be able to grow

930
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:40,680
it we we prefer um

931
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:42,960
Greenhouse for uh in in what we do

932
00:41:40,679 --> 00:41:45,480
because it still gets all of the natural

933
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:47,480
cycles we have to obviously you know

934
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:49,480
with light dep and you have to you know

935
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:52,119
increase the light certain times and

936
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:53,760
different times of year Etc but there's

937
00:41:52,119 --> 00:41:56,440
we also like the idea that the plants

938
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:57,920
are being stressed to a certain extent

939
00:41:56,440 --> 00:42:00,519
um

940
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:02,358
I I've really never understood the whole

941
00:42:00,519 --> 00:42:03,719
indoor market I understand if you're

942
00:42:02,358 --> 00:42:05,440
have if you're have to be stealth and

943
00:42:03,719 --> 00:42:07,959
you're in an illegal place then that's a

944
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:10,559
whole entire different thing but they T

945
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:12,119
call it Bud porn that comes out because

946
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:13,480
they're they're pretty little nugs and

947
00:42:12,119 --> 00:42:15,119
they're pretty and they trim them to

948
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:16,639
death and they're very but then people

949
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:18,599
are go oh wow isn't that great and

950
00:42:16,639 --> 00:42:20,279
they're either going to then destroy

951
00:42:18,599 --> 00:42:21,920
them in a concentrate or they're going

952
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:23,839
to put a match to it to light it up

953
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:25,599
anyway which just feels really

954
00:42:23,838 --> 00:42:27,719
destructive to something that you just

955
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:31,039
cultivated to be pretty they're born to

956
00:42:27,719 --> 00:42:33,639
die huh said they're born to

957
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:35,719
die I I I differ with that a little bit

958
00:42:33,639 --> 00:42:38,118
just in the fact that that I believe

959
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:40,078
that by creating the perfect environment

960
00:42:38,119 --> 00:42:42,559
for a plant to grow in you can pervert

961
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:44,680
per uh make the perfect medicine

962
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:46,160
basically that's really how I believe it

963
00:42:44,679 --> 00:42:49,719
when you grow with Outdoors you have the

964
00:42:46,159 --> 00:42:52,039
outside elements and so and so yeah yeah

965
00:42:49,719 --> 00:42:53,919
so but even with Greenhouse but even

966
00:42:52,039 --> 00:42:55,880
with Greenhouse it's still it still is

967
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:57,680
not the same as indoor it still it's not

968
00:42:55,880 --> 00:43:00,000
going to come out with that same tpine

969
00:42:57,679 --> 00:43:02,838
profile that same that same blood

970
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,199
structure that same same crystal content

971
00:43:02,838 --> 00:43:06,279
all of that you are not going to get

972
00:43:04,199 --> 00:43:08,199
that without doing it indoor yeah I I

973
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:11,359
would I would agree with Jason but we're

974
00:43:08,199 --> 00:43:13,279
big indoor cultivators um on our Shelf

975
00:43:11,358 --> 00:43:16,318
at Buds and Roses we have put some of

976
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:18,599
the best Greenhouse um on the shelf for

977
00:43:16,318 --> 00:43:22,159
maybe half the price of our indoor but

978
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:24,920
our patients do prefer the indoor uh but

979
00:43:22,159 --> 00:43:26,879
I think I'm biased Los Angeles is not

980
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:28,400
only the largest retail Market but the

981
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:30,559
Lar largest market for indoor

982
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:32,599
cultivation as well but I think indoor

983
00:43:30,559 --> 00:43:34,480
cultivators need to um we started

984
00:43:32,599 --> 00:43:37,640
cultivators Alliance actually in Los

985
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:40,119
Angeles to um build up the the ethics

986
00:43:37,639 --> 00:43:41,960
and the responsibility um behind indoor

987
00:43:40,119 --> 00:43:46,519
cultivators so I think there's a place

988
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:50,199
for it I I mean personally from uh doing

989
00:43:46,519 --> 00:43:53,039
extractions with Greenhouse uh I've seen

990
00:43:50,199 --> 00:43:56,719
some of the best extractions from all

991
00:43:53,039 --> 00:43:59,759
organic greenhouse and you know I think

992
00:43:56,719 --> 00:44:02,838
there is some importance to having it be

993
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:07,800
sungrown but yet in a controlled

994
00:44:02,838 --> 00:44:10,440
environment of the greenhouse and um and

995
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:13,359
even when the farmer you know is taking

996
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:16,559
down that crop and what they do to

997
00:44:13,358 --> 00:44:19,440
protect the uh tpin and the the

998
00:44:16,559 --> 00:44:22,240
internals of that gland you know

999
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:24,280
immediately freezing it you know cuz

1000
00:44:22,239 --> 00:44:26,358
you're dealing with volatile organic

1001
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:29,119
compounds that are immediately

1002
00:44:26,358 --> 00:44:31,519
vaporizing as soon as it's cut down you

1003
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:34,358
know and and as a concentrate maker

1004
00:44:31,519 --> 00:44:36,318
you're trying to harvest that stuff and

1005
00:44:34,358 --> 00:44:38,799
you know you need to either do it

1006
00:44:36,318 --> 00:44:41,920
immediately or freeze it or you know

1007
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:45,160
figure out a way yeah to uh to get after

1008
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:48,119
it but yeah I have noticed definitely

1009
00:44:45,159 --> 00:44:50,679
organic Greenhouse weed makes the best

1010
00:44:48,119 --> 00:44:53,760
concentrate from any any of you have

1011
00:44:50,679 --> 00:44:58,358
ever been in a field of cannabis when

1012
00:44:53,760 --> 00:45:03,319
the plant are 15 to 20 ft High

1013
00:44:58,358 --> 00:45:06,880
yes it's like Ze plant a plant in full

1014
00:45:03,318 --> 00:45:09,880
power outside will

1015
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:12,680
never be able to be compared for from

1016
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:16,039
Anything Grows indoor doesn't matter how

1017
00:45:12,679 --> 00:45:20,159
good you are indoor the expression of a

1018
00:45:16,039 --> 00:45:22,318
plant outdoor fully grown in a soil you

1019
00:45:20,159 --> 00:45:25,239
cannot compare it when you when you walk

1020
00:45:22,318 --> 00:45:28,039
indoor at night do you think the plum

1021
00:45:25,239 --> 00:45:30,358
doesn't know that outdoor it it's it's

1022
00:45:28,039 --> 00:45:32,239
daytime that she should sleep or the

1023
00:45:30,358 --> 00:45:34,598
opposite you think that when you grow

1024
00:45:32,239 --> 00:45:38,519
indoors the plant doesn't know about the

1025
00:45:34,599 --> 00:45:42,960
Moon the Moon cycle like the plant is a

1026
00:45:38,519 --> 00:45:46,318
living organism that is aware and

1027
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:50,039
intelligent and we don't

1028
00:45:46,318 --> 00:45:52,639
even pay attention to it it's like you

1029
00:45:50,039 --> 00:45:55,480
you're dealing with a living organism

1030
00:45:52,639 --> 00:45:58,078
that let you do a lot of thing because

1031
00:45:55,480 --> 00:46:02,358
you can bring a

1032
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:05,160
a genetic further than any bees poll

1033
00:46:02,358 --> 00:46:08,279
pollin but there is a limit to what a

1034
00:46:05,159 --> 00:46:11,159
plant can give you indoor

1035
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:14,280
without without uh like when you have

1036
00:46:11,159 --> 00:46:17,078
ventilation it's it's a fun it's nice a

1037
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:19,640
fun it makes it makes the pl stronger

1038
00:46:17,079 --> 00:46:23,318
but it's not the win it will never be

1039
00:46:19,639 --> 00:46:25,440
the UV that you have in a grow room you

1040
00:46:23,318 --> 00:46:28,000
don't have the UV that the sun like

1041
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:31,200
there is no there is no light that

1042
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:34,239
duplicate the sun there is no room that

1043
00:46:31,199 --> 00:46:37,199
give a quarter of a moon to a full moon

1044
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:40,318
it's like you have to realize the beauty

1045
00:46:37,199 --> 00:46:44,159
of that plant outdoor or she can give

1046
00:46:40,318 --> 00:46:47,039
the maximum indoor you're trying to take

1047
00:46:44,159 --> 00:46:49,719
the maximum of her pushing her to do

1048
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:52,119
something that naturally it's against

1049
00:46:49,719 --> 00:46:54,558
her nature you know what I mean so you

1050
00:46:52,119 --> 00:46:56,280
do great R don't get me no no no I I

1051
00:46:54,559 --> 00:47:00,280
agree with you with what you're saying

1052
00:46:56,280 --> 00:47:03,599
but at the end of the day sales dictate

1053
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:06,800
the market yep and the bottom line is

1054
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:09,119
indoor sales a 100 times more than

1055
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:11,318
outdoor or Greenhouse period you know

1056
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:13,200
what I can just imagine somebody coming

1057
00:47:11,318 --> 00:47:15,759
to me with some disease and me saying

1058
00:47:13,199 --> 00:47:17,639
nah that's not financially viable that's

1059
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:20,200
not even realistic that's not even a

1060
00:47:17,639 --> 00:47:21,639
realistic statement but it's far as that

1061
00:47:20,199 --> 00:47:24,759
if it's not going to

1062
00:47:21,639 --> 00:47:27,639
be if the Emerald Triangle wasn't

1063
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:31,640
exporting all their flower on other

1064
00:47:27,639 --> 00:47:34,159
coast we will you will know what is Sun

1065
00:47:31,639 --> 00:47:36,799
grown flower it's just that you don't

1066
00:47:34,159 --> 00:47:41,118
find them in a market it's very simple

1067
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:44,119
none of you have really know what is a

1068
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:49,160
beautifully sunr flower coming from

1069
00:47:44,119 --> 00:47:51,240
mandino it's like Ze flower they indoor

1070
00:47:49,159 --> 00:47:54,519
cannot compete with that but it's not

1071
00:47:51,239 --> 00:47:58,558
known people have are not educated to

1072
00:47:54,519 --> 00:48:01,400
choose sunr to to word indoor because

1073
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:04,480
sunr needs dirty bird shit on it it's

1074
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:07,240
like how would you smoke that well no at

1075
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:09,519
the same time too um from from from my

1076
00:48:07,239 --> 00:48:11,558
experience of running stores for so long

1077
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:14,719
I've also noticed that outdoor

1078
00:48:11,559 --> 00:48:17,040
Greenhouse flowers decompose at a much

1079
00:48:14,719 --> 00:48:19,480
faster rate than indoor flowers decompos

1080
00:48:17,039 --> 00:48:22,239
also their color changes faster their

1081
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:24,480
taste changes faster all of this changes

1082
00:48:22,239 --> 00:48:26,399
in a number of weeks as opposed to a

1083
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:27,440
number of months well let me let me say

1084
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:30,838
this

1085
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:33,119
so bring Jason and I the best Su grown

1086
00:48:30,838 --> 00:48:34,838
we would be happy to carry it and get it

1087
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:38,400
off to our patients and you know we're

1088
00:48:34,838 --> 00:48:40,599
all for it we're all for it so all right

1089
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:42,599
um I I'll go to questions and then I

1090
00:48:40,599 --> 00:48:44,480
think we'll wrap it up go ahead I just

1091
00:48:42,599 --> 00:48:48,519
wanted to make a comment about this if I

1092
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:51,599
may um I've been around marijuana for

1093
00:48:48,519 --> 00:48:53,239
decades uh my Collective just down the

1094
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:57,359
street been there we're in our 10th

1095
00:48:53,239 --> 00:48:59,719
year I go to Amsterdam every year and I

1096
00:48:57,358 --> 00:49:02,798
buy all of the or

1097
00:48:59,719 --> 00:49:04,358
seeds I go to Spain to pick them up I

1098
00:49:02,798 --> 00:49:07,039
bring them

1099
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:09,880
back give them to our Growers they grow

1100
00:49:07,039 --> 00:49:13,400
organically we have one indoor grower

1101
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:16,798
all the rest are outdoor uh one

1102
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:20,480
Greenhouse I will smoke nothing but

1103
00:49:16,798 --> 00:49:22,679
sunr the new stuff now the sunr from

1104
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:25,719
from award-winning sves is the best

1105
00:49:22,679 --> 00:49:28,558
marijuana out there it's so pure when

1106
00:49:25,719 --> 00:49:31,118
you smoke it that you you just can't go

1107
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:33,119
back to indoor that has been grown what

1108
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:35,280
they say organically but I don't believe

1109
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:37,599
that we have organic Growers but there's

1110
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:41,839
always that taste

1111
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:44,880
that weird uh chemical taste that's in

1112
00:49:41,838 --> 00:49:46,759
it that is never in a really really good

1113
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:48,880
Sun grown from award-winning seeds

1114
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:51,040
marijuana it's the best as far as I'm

1115
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:57,640
concerned personally my

1116
00:49:51,039 --> 00:50:01,039
personal all right anyone else awesome

1117
00:49:57,639 --> 00:50:04,239
I I think um a lot of of new Edibles

1118
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:07,358
Brands transdermal Brands even VAP pen

1119
00:50:04,239 --> 00:50:10,199
Brands look for extractors to provide

1120
00:50:07,358 --> 00:50:12,039
them with concentrate material to uh to

1121
00:50:10,199 --> 00:50:15,000
put into their products could you all

1122
00:50:12,039 --> 00:50:16,639
compare and contrast the uh the cost of

1123
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,679
production of the different extraction

1124
00:50:16,639 --> 00:50:20,279
techniques and their suitability for for

1125
00:50:18,679 --> 00:50:21,798
these different applications the cost of

1126
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:24,359
production is really going to depend on

1127
00:50:21,798 --> 00:50:25,960
the actual individual extractor how much

1128
00:50:24,358 --> 00:50:28,400
Machinery they actually have and are

1129
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:30,798
able to process at one given time

1130
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:33,119
because the more you can able to produce

1131
00:50:30,798 --> 00:50:35,119
the lower your price per gram cost to

1132
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:37,480
produce so it's always going to depend

1133
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:39,920
on the actual concentrate maker

1134
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:41,358
depending on what the IND individual

1135
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:43,280
price point will be and how fast he's

1136
00:50:41,358 --> 00:50:48,400
able to process

1137
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:53,400
it uh I think you're asking like uh

1138
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:56,240
Styles right CO2 and BHO and correct

1139
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:59,119
yeah so I mean CO2 extraction is going

1140
00:50:56,239 --> 00:51:02,879
to be the most expensive to do uh

1141
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:05,838
because the equipment needed to produce

1142
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:09,039
that extraction it's very expensive uh

1143
00:51:05,838 --> 00:51:13,000
due upon the high operating pressures of

1144
00:51:09,039 --> 00:51:16,000
CO2 and so the thickness of the steel

1145
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:18,599
has to be super thick it has to be bulky

1146
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:21,798
whereas um a butane

1147
00:51:18,599 --> 00:51:25,559
extraction um it's a low it's a low

1148
00:51:21,798 --> 00:51:29,280
operating pressure solvent um

1149
00:51:25,559 --> 00:51:32,798
it it's like operates at like 50 psi at

1150
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:35,079
like 100° you know which is not not high

1151
00:51:32,798 --> 00:51:38,199
at all when it comes to pressure so you

1152
00:51:35,079 --> 00:51:42,720
can produce this equipment relatively

1153
00:51:38,199 --> 00:51:46,719
cheap um alcohol is probably even less

1154
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:49,759
expensive considering you just need like

1155
00:51:46,719 --> 00:51:49,759
I don't know a

1156
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:56,838
giant say again sense to scale up

1157
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:59,200
alcohol

1158
00:51:56,838 --> 00:52:02,880
say to scale up alcohol I would not want

1159
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:02,879
to scale up a bad technique

1160
00:52:05,318 --> 00:52:10,960
of I think it's the best extraction

1161
00:52:08,358 --> 00:52:13,519
technique there is in the extraction

1162
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:15,880
world but people don't put those okay

1163
00:52:13,519 --> 00:52:19,000
but you can't say that you can't say

1164
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:22,000
that it's like this is the best way to

1165
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:27,000
extract the most volatile in the

1166
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:29,519
industry of the perfume it's V and so

1167
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:33,318
you cannot say that it's bad technique

1168
00:52:29,519 --> 00:52:33,318
that's not really nice you can say

1169
00:52:36,519 --> 00:52:43,358
people say it's not a bad technique

1170
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:47,119
because it has its uses absolutely but I

1171
00:52:43,358 --> 00:52:50,519
don't believe it belongs in a medicine

1172
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:52,880
to use mutane extraction possibly

1173
00:52:50,519 --> 00:52:56,039
recreational or some Turin that you want

1174
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:57,838
to add to your Frankenstein concentrate

1175
00:52:56,039 --> 00:53:01,039
but using

1176
00:52:57,838 --> 00:53:02,759
actual why not use I'd like to bring up

1177
00:53:01,039 --> 00:53:05,838
something that you mentioned earlier I

1178
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:08,160
mean you said that you you give your

1179
00:53:05,838 --> 00:53:09,798
clients you know you you give them an

1180
00:53:08,159 --> 00:53:12,639
organic diet but you wouldn't tell them

1181
00:53:09,798 --> 00:53:15,159
to use Pam not would you tell your

1182
00:53:12,639 --> 00:53:18,358
clients to go get

1183
00:53:15,159 --> 00:53:21,759
drunk no I wouldn't but if but your

1184
00:53:18,358 --> 00:53:24,519
solvent of choice is ethanol correct

1185
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:26,839
which is something we use to get drunk

1186
00:53:24,519 --> 00:53:29,000
well maybe you do I don't use to get

1187
00:53:26,838 --> 00:53:31,279
drunk I might use it to relax in the

1188
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:33,039
evening a glass of wine really though

1189
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:35,319
what's the difference really though it

1190
00:53:33,039 --> 00:53:38,079
comes down to the end product and how

1191
00:53:35,318 --> 00:53:40,159
well it was refined there's a lot of

1192
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:42,960
really good solvents out there but at

1193
00:53:40,159 --> 00:53:44,679
the end of the day if it's refined out

1194
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:46,318
properly it doesn't really matter how

1195
00:53:44,679 --> 00:53:47,919
you get very soon it's not about the

1196
00:53:46,318 --> 00:53:49,719
solvent it's about the quality of the

1197
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:51,519
product going in in the first place it's

1198
00:53:49,719 --> 00:53:53,279
not about the solvent it's about the

1199
00:53:51,519 --> 00:53:55,920
quality of the product I'm making sure

1200
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:57,760
the solvent's not there all right all

1201
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:58,720
right all right are there are there any

1202
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:01,119
more

1203
00:53:58,719 --> 00:54:02,480
questions yeah you've had your hand up

1204
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:06,838
for a while go

1205
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:09,960
ahead yes to um the state of which the

1206
00:54:06,838 --> 00:54:12,199
Cannabis is um in as far as you guys are

1207
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:15,920
talking about the change in between

1208
00:54:12,199 --> 00:54:18,919
Greenhouse or or organic outdoor indoor

1209
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:22,559
wouldn't that be based on um how like

1210
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:24,720
the curing process lash the the

1211
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:28,040
consistency and stability in which the

1212
00:54:24,719 --> 00:54:30,358
Cannabis is being through that period of

1213
00:54:28,039 --> 00:54:32,199
time so which would be burping the

1214
00:54:30,358 --> 00:54:37,000
whatever container in which the Cannabis

1215
00:54:32,199 --> 00:54:40,159
is kept in so that reflect how the the

1216
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:43,079
longevity of freshness the cidis

1217
00:54:40,159 --> 00:54:45,358
has most likely but I I think what Jason

1218
00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:46,880
was saying is it just seems that the

1219
00:54:45,358 --> 00:54:48,838
basically it's it's kind of like this

1220
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:50,160
and this is a really like weird analogy

1221
00:54:48,838 --> 00:54:52,880
and it might not even be politically

1222
00:54:50,159 --> 00:54:56,399
correct to say this but this is the best

1223
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:59,440
analogy I can give you IM imagine in

1224
00:54:56,400 --> 00:55:01,920
indoor flowers as rich kids in Beverly

1225
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:04,519
Hills and you imagine outdoor as poor

1226
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:06,039
kids in the hood and all of the aders MS

1227
00:55:04,519 --> 00:55:08,159
that they have to go through in life and

1228
00:55:06,039 --> 00:55:09,838
to to be able to grow in that type of an

1229
00:55:08,159 --> 00:55:11,358
environment you're in Beverly Hills

1230
00:55:09,838 --> 00:55:12,400
you're in a perfect stable environment

1231
00:55:11,358 --> 00:55:14,920
that's a

1232
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:17,119
maintained same same temperature same

1233
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:18,400
everything outdoor you're subject to the

1234
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:19,680
elements you're getting rained on you're

1235
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:21,119
getting trampled on you're getting bugs

1236
00:55:19,679 --> 00:55:23,358
eating on you you're having all kinds of

1237
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:26,680
problems but you

1238
00:55:23,358 --> 00:55:28,038
probably that's for sure that's for sure

1239
00:55:26,679 --> 00:55:29,838
that that's without a doubt but at the

1240
00:55:28,039 --> 00:55:31,079
end of the day it's about creating the

1241
00:55:29,838 --> 00:55:34,519
perfect environment to create the

1242
00:55:31,079 --> 00:55:37,480
perfect product all right so I think

1243
00:55:34,519 --> 00:55:40,559
that's oh uh Barrett go

1244
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:42,519
ahead last question what are thei that

1245
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:45,760
you guys are

1246
00:55:42,519 --> 00:55:48,559
finding you using how much of the AC

1247
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:51,440
ingredients that's on the FL are is

1248
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:55,079
being taken off when you're tra how much

1249
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:57,798
is left off uh as a ash maker and I I

1250
00:55:55,079 --> 00:56:00,798
can look with a manif glass my trim to

1251
00:55:57,798 --> 00:56:04,639
be sure I don't forget any head I get

1252
00:56:00,798 --> 00:56:04,639
between 7 to

1253
00:56:05,159 --> 00:56:13,440
15% according to the strain the grower

1254
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:17,720
and uh many many many things but as an

1255
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:20,920
average and a good average it's 10% it's

1256
00:56:17,719 --> 00:56:22,078
already very nice 15% it's rare is some

1257
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:27,039
special

1258
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:30,200
genetic uh I found um if the cannabis

1259
00:56:27,039 --> 00:56:35,359
being tested has a

1260
00:56:30,199 --> 00:56:38,829
22% um uh THC or whatever usually my

1261
00:56:35,358 --> 00:56:41,940
yields are going to be very similar

1262
00:56:38,829 --> 00:56:41,940
