[Music]

2
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:23,730
so Monique has a presentation now she's

3
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:26,189
going to talk about more of ways to be

4
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:30,480
involved in the state level as well

5
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:32,579
because we we've got to try to get some

6
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,700
relief here for farmers that are being

7
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:37,920
totally totally crushed by all the fees

8
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:41,219
and the market not being there because

9
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:43,620
it's across the board and so with that

10
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:46,230
Monique let's hear how we can get more

11
00:00:43,619 --> 00:00:48,839
involved I'm just a small-time farmer

12
00:00:46,229 --> 00:00:50,699
and I started getting involved in the

13
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,350
local policy by going to the board of

14
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:55,320
supervisor meetings watching Ron

15
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:56,850
watching KC from my television screen at

16
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,710
home watching YouTube and was like I

17
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:00,448
gotta get out there I got to speak to

18
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:03,149
this because this is really important

19
00:01:00,448 --> 00:01:07,109
and so I have been really engaged just

20
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:08,400
as my own and so I went to the last two

21
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:11,040
state meetings that happened in

22
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,900
Sacramento for the cannabis Advisory

23
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,000
Committee and spoke during the public

24
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:17,939
comment period about the topics that

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,799
were important to me and my community so

26
00:01:17,938 --> 00:01:23,250
I'm just gonna hit some highlights they

27
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:25,110
have I think 10 subcommittees and in the

28
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:27,239
interest of time I just picked out micro

29
00:01:25,109 --> 00:01:30,118
business and the cultivation

30
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:31,618
subcommittee and just give you guys an

31
00:01:30,118 --> 00:01:32,239
overview of where we're at with that

32
00:01:31,618 --> 00:01:35,938
right now

33
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:39,298
so the cultivators subcommittee made a

34
00:01:35,938 --> 00:01:41,658
couple recommendations that they want to

35
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:44,729
see the bureau of cannabis control

36
00:01:41,659 --> 00:01:46,590
basically change in the current

37
00:01:44,728 --> 00:01:48,659
regulation so this is hopefully the

38
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:52,290
hopeful part of our presentation today

39
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:55,500
the first two were the generator our

40
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:58,140
meters they want to amend section 80 306

41
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:00,319
number d to allow aftermarket non

42
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:04,379
resettable our meters to be installed

43
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:05,789
and the comment from CDFA was that

44
00:02:04,379 --> 00:02:07,859
there's no provision right now in the

45
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:10,020
ordinance or in the regulation that

46
00:02:07,859 --> 00:02:11,759
prohibits that but they still wanted to

47
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,620
get this put in because they feel like

48
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:17,878
it's not clearly defined for

49
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:20,459
public so that recommended motion passed

50
00:02:17,878 --> 00:02:23,310
through the larger subcommittee the

51
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:26,128
second one was to add the definition of

52
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:29,039
outdoor cultivation by allowing the use

53
00:02:26,128 --> 00:02:32,250
of light deprivation techniques that was

54
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:34,620
also a path or that passed by the whole

55
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:38,549
committee and then the other

56
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:41,939
recommendations were unfortunately in

57
00:02:38,549 --> 00:02:45,959
statute so it has to be a legislative

58
00:02:41,939 --> 00:02:47,729
fix basically okay so these ones we are

59
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:49,739
good it's gonna be a little bit more of

60
00:02:47,729 --> 00:02:51,689
a battle to get them fixed

61
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:53,849
so I'll just hit them really quick

62
00:02:51,689 --> 00:02:56,430
number one was composting a waste and

63
00:02:53,848 --> 00:02:58,798
waste definition and the ability to sell

64
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:01,469
unused waste products that lack the

65
00:02:58,799 --> 00:03:03,000
cannabinoids the second one this one is

66
00:03:01,469 --> 00:03:04,289
really important to me personally

67
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,568
because I do have a twenty five hundred

68
00:03:04,289 --> 00:03:08,969
square foot permit in Mendocino County

69
00:03:06,568 --> 00:03:12,119
but the state for this type of license

70
00:03:08,969 --> 00:03:13,680
only allows me twenty five plants so

71
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,959
they want to add square footage of

72
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,849
twenty five hundred and five thousand to

73
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:22,169
the specialty cottage and the cottage

74
00:03:17,848 --> 00:03:25,768
license types it is Oh five thousands in

75
00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:26,880
already just not the twenty five okay

76
00:03:25,769 --> 00:03:28,560
cool

77
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:30,628
and then number three is to allow

78
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,699
cultivators to transport their product

79
00:03:30,628 --> 00:03:35,969
to nearby licensed processors without

80
00:03:32,699 --> 00:03:37,918
obtaining additional licensure that's a

81
00:03:35,969 --> 00:03:38,969
really important one the ones that are

82
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:41,730
going to be in bold that you're going to

83
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:45,659
see in a moment these ones were taken

84
00:03:41,729 --> 00:03:48,929
out of the the meeting in LA and they

85
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:51,448
wanted to it was my understanding to

86
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:53,519
basically bring those ones forward in

87
00:03:51,449 --> 00:03:55,049
that meeting but the meeting went so

88
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:59,430
long that they didn't even have enough

89
00:03:55,049 --> 00:04:01,650
time to really talk about it obviously

90
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:03,599
go back so the other one is to allow

91
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:06,750
cultivated material to be transferred

92
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:09,598
between a and M designation license

93
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:11,489
types until the point of sale this is a

94
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:14,668
topic that was discussed in a lot of the

95
00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:17,060
different subcommittees and a lot of

96
00:04:14,669 --> 00:04:19,049
public comment was expressed about how

97
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:22,740
cultivators really shouldn't be the ones

98
00:04:19,048 --> 00:04:24,538
designating the crop as adult use or

99
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:26,569
medical use we should wait till it goes

100
00:04:24,538 --> 00:04:28,399
to the retail location for that to be

101
00:04:26,569 --> 00:04:30,019
ignited because the plant stays the same

102
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:33,919
the whole time it's really at the end

103
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:37,519
point that that should be decided so

104
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:39,290
that got a lot of support the next one

105
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:41,120
is to create a cultivation based tax

106
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:43,700
incentive for products being set aside

107
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,470
for compassionate use programs that was

108
00:04:43,699 --> 00:04:48,139
a really important topic and they all

109
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:51,020
agreed to move that one forward before

110
00:04:48,139 --> 00:04:52,969
the next meeting number six was

111
00:04:51,019 --> 00:04:54,979
cultivators should be able to batch per

112
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:56,720
area at the time of harvest for track

113
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:58,879
and trace purposes and that they should

114
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:02,420
not need to identify each harvest back

115
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:04,730
to the individual plant number seven the

116
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:06,620
CAC make changes to the lab testing

117
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:08,750
system to address the burdens that may

118
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:10,540
impede a path to legalization such as

119
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:13,069
the loss of strains high cost

120
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:15,020
inefficient accuracy levels lack of

121
00:05:13,069 --> 00:05:17,269
protections to the cultivator among

122
00:05:15,019 --> 00:05:19,609
others they said that some of those

123
00:05:17,269 --> 00:05:20,990
items are in statute and some of them

124
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:24,080
aren't so they have to kind of pick that

125
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:25,790
apart a little bit more number eight

126
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:28,209
consideration of issues related to

127
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:30,560
scaled licensing tears for nurseries

128
00:05:28,209 --> 00:05:32,539
packaging of seeds in batch count by

129
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,300
bulk weight established genetic

130
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:37,340
repositories providing flexibility to

131
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:39,379
develop genetic diversity allowing

132
00:05:37,339 --> 00:05:42,169
cultivators to transport propagated

133
00:05:39,379 --> 00:05:44,089
plant material and seeds removing the

134
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:46,910
requirement for nurseries to designate

135
00:05:44,089 --> 00:05:48,829
seed and/or plant stock as a RM material

136
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:51,050
allowing cultivators to provide

137
00:05:48,829 --> 00:05:53,060
nurseries with genetic stock allowing

138
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:54,819
cultivators to provide other cultivators

139
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:57,439
with plant materials in an emergency

140
00:05:54,819 --> 00:05:59,750
provided proper documentation for all of

141
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:01,969
the above and I just think it's great

142
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:05,509
like they're really trying to work to

143
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:08,300
fix these problems so yeah cuz we're

144
00:06:05,509 --> 00:06:10,670
showing up we're speaking to it number

145
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:13,340
nine create a mechanism for cultivators

146
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:15,350
to conduct self transport distribution

147
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:17,929
of their own product to a centralized

148
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:20,960
processing facility manufacturing

149
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:23,209
facility distributor or a lab for pre

150
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:25,219
testing without the same requirements of

151
00:06:23,209 --> 00:06:29,089
the existing transportation license

152
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:31,990
including BCC regulations sections 504 4

153
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:34,879
and 504 7 which really pertain to

154
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:36,889
cameras by either amending the existing

155
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:40,249
transportation distribution license or

156
00:06:36,889 --> 00:06:41,928
creating a new license type this one

157
00:06:40,249 --> 00:06:43,759
I'm really excited about and I really

158
00:06:41,928 --> 00:06:47,478
hope we can work to figure this one out

159
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:49,129
because as a cultivator we need to have

160
00:06:47,478 --> 00:06:51,528
this is a bottleneck right now in my

161
00:06:49,129 --> 00:06:54,349
opinion if we have to take our product

162
00:06:51,528 --> 00:06:56,509
to a distribution facility and then a

163
00:06:54,348 --> 00:06:59,058
testing lab has to go to the distributor

164
00:06:56,509 --> 00:07:01,218
to test the product I mean that's a lot

165
00:06:59,059 --> 00:07:03,259
of movement happening so if we have the

166
00:07:01,218 --> 00:07:05,658
ability to bring our product to the

167
00:07:03,259 --> 00:07:08,299
testing lab that's gonna alleviate some

168
00:07:05,658 --> 00:07:10,959
of that bottleneck so and that was also

169
00:07:08,298 --> 00:07:14,118
voted on by the larger subcommittee

170
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:17,119
subcommittees and then micro business

171
00:07:14,119 --> 00:07:19,729
the committee didn't even have a chance

172
00:07:17,119 --> 00:07:21,319
to speak at the LA meeting because they

173
00:07:19,728 --> 00:07:23,088
ran out of time and that meeting went

174
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:24,829
for seven hours I think they had a half

175
00:07:23,088 --> 00:07:28,069
hour lunch break they didn't take any

176
00:07:24,829 --> 00:07:30,168
other breaks besides that so this is

177
00:07:28,069 --> 00:07:31,879
going to come up at the next meeting and

178
00:07:30,168 --> 00:07:34,218
so I'll go ahead and go through this

179
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:36,249
these are recommendations related to

180
00:07:34,218 --> 00:07:38,629
regulatory changes that can be adopted

181
00:07:36,249 --> 00:07:40,609
the first one is about security

182
00:07:38,629 --> 00:07:41,869
requirements for micro businesses and

183
00:07:40,608 --> 00:07:44,478
that they should be determined by the

184
00:07:41,869 --> 00:07:46,610
local jurisdiction and the regulations

185
00:07:44,478 --> 00:07:49,338
should not be unduly burdensome to small

186
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:51,439
businesses and micro businesses there

187
00:07:49,338 --> 00:07:54,319
was a lot of discussion during this on

188
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:56,389
this topic and that what works in LA

189
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:57,468
doesn't work in Mendocino County so

190
00:07:56,389 --> 00:07:59,658
let's put it up to the local

191
00:07:57,468 --> 00:08:03,408
jurisdictions to decide how they want to

192
00:07:59,658 --> 00:08:05,449
maneuver the security issues number two

193
00:08:03,408 --> 00:08:07,158
clarification of micro business that

194
00:08:05,449 --> 00:08:09,799
includes tiers based on gross receipts

195
00:08:07,158 --> 00:08:11,449
and the number of employees the fee

196
00:08:09,798 --> 00:08:13,548
schedule should be redefined to include

197
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:15,559
a ceiling that delineates when the

198
00:08:13,548 --> 00:08:17,959
business is no longer considered a micro

199
00:08:15,559 --> 00:08:19,789
business incentives should be provided

200
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:22,579
based on equity for compassionate use

201
00:08:19,788 --> 00:08:24,709
and rural operators on this one they

202
00:08:22,579 --> 00:08:26,809
were really talking about at some point

203
00:08:24,709 --> 00:08:28,788
a micro business isn't a micro business

204
00:08:26,809 --> 00:08:30,439
anymore well in like where are we going

205
00:08:28,788 --> 00:08:32,328
to cap it because people are going to

206
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:34,129
take advantage of this license type and

207
00:08:32,328 --> 00:08:36,528
it's really designed for small farmers

208
00:08:34,129 --> 00:08:38,839
small businesses to kind of be a

209
00:08:36,528 --> 00:08:40,610
computer or a competitor against the

210
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:42,169
larger corporations but if large

211
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:43,788
corporations are taking advantage of

212
00:08:42,168 --> 00:08:46,220
that micro license type that's an issue

213
00:08:43,788 --> 00:08:49,778
so I think this will be a good one if we

214
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:49,778
can get that to be amended

215
00:08:51,269 --> 00:08:56,490
then these are the recommendations that

216
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:58,589
do require statutory changes number one

217
00:08:56,490 --> 00:09:00,899
micro-business licensees should be

218
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:03,810
allowed to utilize farm stand sales as

219
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:05,879
well as farm direct sales model such as

220
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:08,449
CSAs without a brick-and-mortar to

221
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:11,279
satisfy retail component of the license

222
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:12,780
number two all micro business activity

223
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:15,689
should not have to take place on a

224
00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:17,549
single premise number three micro

225
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:19,470
business licensees should be allowed to

226
00:09:17,549 --> 00:09:21,870
conduct offsite processing as one of

227
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:23,610
their qualifying activities and use

228
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:24,480
shared facilities for any of their

229
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:27,090
activities

230
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,220
number four recognizing that micro

231
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:31,710
businesses frequently cannot operate at

232
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:33,810
one contiguous location in large part

233
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:35,730
because of local land use ordinances and

234
00:09:33,809 --> 00:09:37,949
that it can be cost prohibitive for a

235
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:40,409
micro businesses to obtain multiple

236
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:42,780
licenses an accessory license should be

237
00:09:40,409 --> 00:09:45,120
created to tie premises together beyond

238
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:46,709
the simple geographic location while

239
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,659
ensuring that the flow of the product

240
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:51,030
maintained maintains a single chain of

241
00:09:48,659 --> 00:09:52,860
custody and I just think there's a lot

242
00:09:51,029 --> 00:09:54,809
of thought going into these subcommittee

243
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:57,419
meetings and you know a lot of it too is

244
00:09:54,809 --> 00:09:59,759
the public getting up and expressing the

245
00:09:57,419 --> 00:10:01,229
issues and the concerns and the people

246
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:03,029
at least that I've witnessed in these

247
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:07,340
panels they really are listening to us

248
00:10:03,029 --> 00:10:07,339
and this is what's coming out of it so

249
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:18,780
see and so this is the next cannabis

250
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:20,940
Advisory Committee meeting is on May

251
00:10:18,779 --> 00:10:23,549
17th and Oakland they haven't announced

252
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:27,230
the exact time or the location yet but

253
00:10:23,549 --> 00:10:30,959
this is important go to this meeting

254
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:33,149
like really it's amazing like to get up

255
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:35,009
and to speak during public comment and

256
00:10:33,149 --> 00:10:37,259
express what you're facing as a

257
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:39,210
cultivator or whatever business type you

258
00:10:37,259 --> 00:10:40,889
have within this industry they want to

259
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:42,720
hear from us like these people are our

260
00:10:40,889 --> 00:10:44,549
voice right now so unless we tell them

261
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,050
this is a problem this regulation

262
00:10:44,549 --> 00:10:48,059
doesn't work then it's not going to

263
00:10:46,049 --> 00:10:50,549
change and we have this opportunity

264
00:10:48,059 --> 00:10:52,649
right now to affect it and it's really

265
00:10:50,549 --> 00:10:54,419
empowering as an individual to just get

266
00:10:52,649 --> 00:10:56,759
up and speak and have your voice be

267
00:10:54,419 --> 00:10:58,709
heard so I hope that that's the takeaway

268
00:10:56,759 --> 00:10:59,850
for all of us is that we continue to

269
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:02,670
stay engaged because this is our

270
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:05,070
livelihood this is our life and we're

271
00:11:02,669 --> 00:11:05,319
not going to just give it up so stand

272
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:08,500
gay

273
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:14,290
and also make sure that you stay in the

274
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:15,639
firm like people sometimes people see

275
00:11:14,289 --> 00:11:18,309
those and they think that the rules have

276
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:21,490
already changed and that's not how it

277
00:11:18,309 --> 00:11:24,549
works so understanding how the

278
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:26,860
regulatory and the statutory scheme

279
00:11:24,549 --> 00:11:29,589
works and how the law changes these

280
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:32,379
advisory meetings are critical towards

281
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:35,230
establishing better regulations and if

282
00:11:32,379 --> 00:11:38,019
people show up at them and give public

283
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:40,769
comment then they're the people who are

284
00:11:38,019 --> 00:11:43,480
listening to those are advising the

285
00:11:40,769 --> 00:11:45,220
individuals making the law so you can't

286
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:46,990
read what was just said although these

287
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:48,639
are great ideas and these are things

288
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:50,379
that the industry is hopefully moving in

289
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:52,799
and walk away thinking that those rules

290
00:11:50,379 --> 00:11:52,799
a party

291
00:11:53,080 --> 00:12:05,240
