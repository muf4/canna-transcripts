1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:17,000
[Music]

2
00:00:13,958 --> 00:00:18,320
you know I've been in it for a handful

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,750
of years you've been it for some time

4
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,730
but I think the the common ground we

5
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:25,518
have is both coming up in the Bay Area

6
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:27,050
you know myself in Marin County and kind

7
00:00:25,518 --> 00:00:29,509
of being apart and seeing the scene as

8
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:32,750
it evolved the Waldos were around before

9
00:00:29,509 --> 00:00:35,719
my time but talking about strains and

10
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:36,679
specific so it seems like things have

11
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:38,179
changed a lot right

12
00:00:36,679 --> 00:00:40,009
I mean well let's roll it back a little

13
00:00:38,179 --> 00:00:42,409
bit right because there was a time when

14
00:00:40,009 --> 00:00:45,679
there weren't strains right and true did

15
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:47,479
come up in California over the last 15

16
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:51,469
years but before that I was on the East

17
00:00:47,479 --> 00:00:53,148
Coast yeah and the first long stretch a

18
00:00:51,469 --> 00:00:54,739
period of time right we didn't have

19
00:00:53,149 --> 00:00:56,090
strains of cannabis we had source

20
00:00:54,738 --> 00:00:57,500
countries so you would talk about

21
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:59,059
Jamaica and you would talk about

22
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,890
Columbia and you would talk about

23
00:00:59,058 --> 00:01:03,378
Nepalese tempo balls you would talk

24
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:05,150
about redneck Lebanese hash we would

25
00:01:03,378 --> 00:01:07,728
talk about cherry oil you would talk

26
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:09,049
about you talk about Thai sticks and

27
00:01:07,728 --> 00:01:11,420
this is all what came off the ships

28
00:01:09,049 --> 00:01:12,950
right this is yeah so well if you were

29
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:14,840
lucky it came off an airplane because

30
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:17,719
airplanes tend to preserve the preserve

31
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:21,530
the quality of terpenes terpenes get

32
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:23,509
very degraded by salt air right so so in

33
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:25,219
the days of Columbian weed when we were

34
00:01:23,509 --> 00:01:27,379
getting like massive amounts of

35
00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:29,150
Columbian coming in there was there was

36
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:31,908
weed that was flown in there was

37
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:34,880
airplane weed right and that was really

38
00:01:31,909 --> 00:01:37,670
beautiful super Turkey really sticky not

39
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:40,129
super compressed and very expensive like

40
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:41,570
twice as expensive as what we called the

41
00:01:40,129 --> 00:01:43,699
boat weed and the boat weed would be

42
00:01:41,569 --> 00:01:45,978
pressed into bales and it would just be

43
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:47,509
trucked up in these freighters and and

44
00:01:45,978 --> 00:01:49,548
it was you know they were in bilges they

45
00:01:47,509 --> 00:01:52,609
were exposed to to salt air and so they

46
00:01:49,549 --> 00:01:54,820
got oxidized lost a lot of their terpene

47
00:01:52,609 --> 00:01:57,500
content and because they were bricked up

48
00:01:54,819 --> 00:01:59,029
in order to get more into the boat so

49
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:01,159
you know could be could be more

50
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:02,390
reasonably priced they were also they

51
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:04,880
kind of fell apart they had a lot of

52
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:07,069
shaken up right so there was there was

53
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:08,478
plain weed and and there was boat weed

54
00:02:07,069 --> 00:02:11,060
back in the days before there was even

55
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,470
strains right so that it's so

56
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:13,920
interesting to hear that Ike's myself

57
00:02:12,469 --> 00:02:16,139
you know so I'm a

58
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:18,209
born in the 70s but came up in the 80s

59
00:02:16,139 --> 00:02:20,339
and being in Northern California even

60
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:22,020
though we had a lot going on and in our

61
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:24,450
back yard proverbial back yard as you

62
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:26,550
know we would always talk about brick

63
00:02:24,449 --> 00:02:28,469
weed or ditch weed the stuff that was

64
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:31,320
coming in bricks over the border from

65
00:02:28,469 --> 00:02:34,289
Mexico and then the the top shelf for us

66
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:35,789
in this was just to identify my my

67
00:02:34,289 --> 00:02:37,229
generation was Northern Lights that was

68
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:39,239
really like at that point you know that

69
00:02:37,229 --> 00:02:41,099
this was after our Co poco gold but this

70
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,209
is before the Kushans got crazy and some

71
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:44,340
of these other you know long before

72
00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:46,770
cookies and skittles and all these other

73
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:48,090
crazy genetics but to your point

74
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:49,140
auditioning because we had the same

75
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:50,700
thing there was kind of like there was

76
00:02:49,139 --> 00:02:53,099
the okay and then there is a great and

77
00:02:50,699 --> 00:02:55,949
we just classified him as its breaker it

78
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:58,919
must be Northern Lights so so do you

79
00:02:55,949 --> 00:03:02,069
know do you know who who would we

80
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:05,458
consider the Johnny Appleseed of of

81
00:03:02,069 --> 00:03:06,780
cannabis who is the guy most responsible

82
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:08,610
for the fact that we actually have

83
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:11,780
strains of cannabis that we're working

84
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:14,190
with today that's an excellent question

85
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:17,789
I'll tell you who I think the candidate

86
00:03:14,189 --> 00:03:20,400
is a guy named Neville shoemaker Neville

87
00:03:17,789 --> 00:03:21,150
shoemaker started Neville's original

88
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,900
seed bank

89
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:28,230
I believe in 1984 Neville very very

90
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:32,370
interesting cat dual Australian and and

91
00:03:28,229 --> 00:03:35,579
Dutch citizenship lived in Australia

92
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:37,259
developed a passion for cannabis he was

93
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:40,200
the first guy that went all over the

94
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:44,449
world collecting landrace strains of

95
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:44,449
cannabis indigenous strains of cannabis

96
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:50,670
and so forth right and he was the first

97
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:52,739
guy he was the first guy that bred a lot

98
00:03:50,669 --> 00:03:55,349
of what we called the first generation

99
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:59,009
of cannabis hybrids now from those

100
00:03:55,349 --> 00:04:01,199
landrace strains right so Neville was

101
00:03:59,009 --> 00:04:03,959
like like a lot of us then he was struck

102
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:06,149
by what I call divine madness right we

103
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:08,099
were just so fucking sick of cannabis

104
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:10,140
prohibition of being closed into this

105
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:12,090
box of being denied something that was

106
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:13,979
our right that it made us kind of crazy

107
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:15,299
and we were just determined we weren't

108
00:04:13,979 --> 00:04:17,759
going to take it anywhere right

109
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:20,310
so Neville went out on a limb and he

110
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,930
started sending thousands and thousands

111
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:25,139
and thousands of cannabis seeds to the

112
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:26,889
United States right via mail order right

113
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:28,748
it was Neville's original

114
00:04:26,889 --> 00:04:30,280
seedbank and he was the first guy that

115
00:04:28,749 --> 00:04:32,409
sent seeds to the United States this is

116
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:34,448
in the middle of the 1980s when Ronald

117
00:04:32,408 --> 00:04:36,610
Reagan and his crazy wife Nancy are on

118
00:04:34,449 --> 00:04:39,218
the warpath right sterile hates for dare

119
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:40,749
program of 1983 in LA it all started

120
00:04:39,218 --> 00:04:44,680
right here where we are that's what's

121
00:04:40,749 --> 00:04:45,729
crazy yeah so Nevel is living in the

122
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,709
Netherlands where he's doing this

123
00:04:45,728 --> 00:04:49,028
completely legal for him to be sending

124
00:04:47,709 --> 00:04:50,528
cannabis seeds all over the world

125
00:04:49,028 --> 00:04:58,810
including to the United States under

126
00:04:50,528 --> 00:05:01,300
Dutch law not legal under US law well

127
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:03,370
not according to the DEA because what

128
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:05,978
they did and this was a you know one of

129
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:08,500
the darkest chapters in the war on

130
00:05:05,978 --> 00:05:12,968
cannabis is that Neville went to

131
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:16,060
Australia to visit his daughter to visit

132
00:05:12,968 --> 00:05:18,538
his daughter and the and because they

133
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:22,930
could not arrest him in the Netherlands

134
00:05:18,538 --> 00:05:25,959
the US authorities the DEA arrested him

135
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:28,120
in Australia on a conspiracy warrant in

136
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:30,459
the United States and had they been

137
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:32,439
successful in that prosecution my friend

138
00:05:30,459 --> 00:05:36,698
Neville would be in prison in the United

139
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:38,919
States to this day today that was how

140
00:05:36,699 --> 00:05:41,169
many charges they had stacked up on him

141
00:05:38,918 --> 00:05:43,149
okay for sending cannabis seeds to

142
00:05:41,168 --> 00:05:44,859
people who needed them he was going to

143
00:05:43,149 --> 00:05:48,579
get life in prison

144
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:50,439
okay Neville fortunately you know we had

145
00:05:48,579 --> 00:05:53,468
to kind of be wily in those days to

146
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:57,278
survive and he was being helped each

147
00:05:53,468 --> 00:05:59,949
other out somehow on Neville managed to

148
00:05:57,278 --> 00:06:02,620
escape from the Australian jail that he

149
00:05:59,949 --> 00:06:05,259
was being held in managed to get a

150
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:07,418
passport in somebody else's name that

151
00:06:05,259 --> 00:06:11,050
got him out of the country and into the

152
00:06:07,418 --> 00:06:12,878
Netherlands and and ever since then and

153
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:14,588
this is decades ago Neville has been a

154
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:16,539
prisoner in the Netherlands it's a big

155
00:06:14,588 --> 00:06:18,759
jail but he hasn't been able to leave

156
00:06:16,538 --> 00:06:21,068
the country because he's afraid that if

157
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:24,399
he does he's going to be arrested by US

158
00:06:21,069 --> 00:06:26,680
authorities so even in this day and age

159
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:28,209
the last time I talked to him he did not

160
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,769
want to come to you he wanted to come to

161
00:06:28,209 --> 00:06:31,028
the United States he wanted to see this

162
00:06:29,769 --> 00:06:33,008
because he's one of the guys most

163
00:06:31,028 --> 00:06:34,538
responsible for this amazing thing this

164
00:06:33,009 --> 00:06:37,169
whole cannabis Renaissance that's

165
00:06:34,538 --> 00:06:37,168
happening now

166
00:06:37,449 --> 00:06:43,180
so it that was the beginning however of

167
00:06:40,689 --> 00:06:45,069
a long and difficult saga for him that

168
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:47,740
basically wrecked his personal and

169
00:06:45,069 --> 00:06:50,439
financial life and separated him from

170
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:53,050
his family and he endured years and

171
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:55,240
years and years of persecution had a lot

172
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:59,259
of his work appropriated by by other

173
00:06:55,240 --> 00:07:01,240
people and it's one of the most tragic

174
00:06:59,259 --> 00:07:03,788
chapters in the war on cannabis but

175
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:07,030
Neville right Neville should always be

176
00:07:03,788 --> 00:07:09,250
remembered as the guy who first saw over

177
00:07:07,029 --> 00:07:11,049
the horizon who understood that there

178
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:13,418
was going to be such a thing as modern

179
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:16,478
cannabis genetics went out and got those

180
00:07:13,418 --> 00:07:19,329
landrace strains preserved them combined

181
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:22,180
them a true visionary Thank You Neville

182
00:07:19,329 --> 00:07:24,758
yeah in such a great story I mean now

183
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:27,699
that segues into a question I have for

184
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:29,530
you because you've built such a great

185
00:07:27,699 --> 00:07:31,419
brand it offers such a phenomenal

186
00:07:29,529 --> 00:07:33,158
product and you've supported the small

187
00:07:31,418 --> 00:07:34,959
boutique hoop growers over the years up

188
00:07:33,158 --> 00:07:37,149
in Northern California and a lot of

189
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:38,948
those strains it's they've kind of got a

190
00:07:37,149 --> 00:07:40,299
little diluted right I mean are there do

191
00:07:38,949 --> 00:07:41,800
you ever feel like there's a point where

192
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:44,530
I mean I know myself me a little bit of

193
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:46,509
a seed hunter I wanted true Acapulco

194
00:07:44,529 --> 00:07:48,218
gold and supposedly ecstasy out in

195
00:07:46,509 --> 00:07:50,530
Amsterdam has it I want to stop and see

196
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:52,120
if they do but a true non back bred

197
00:07:50,529 --> 00:07:53,829
crossbred Northern Lights I'd like to

198
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,930
find that do you think there's some

199
00:07:53,829 --> 00:07:58,870
potential in finding those original true

200
00:07:55,930 --> 00:08:02,468
pure strains in this day of crazy

201
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:04,269
cookies and and pushes and every other

202
00:08:02,468 --> 00:08:06,038
thing that's going on in the trendy

203
00:08:04,269 --> 00:08:08,348
space of industries well it's a race

204
00:08:06,038 --> 00:08:09,879
against time right there's people like

205
00:08:08,348 --> 00:08:11,589
Neville and people who have come after

206
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:15,430
Neville who have made it their business

207
00:08:11,589 --> 00:08:17,589
to to go into the farthest valleys and

208
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:20,199
the highest mountains on this planet and

209
00:08:17,589 --> 00:08:22,750
find indigenous land race strains of

210
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:25,120
cannabis hopefully you know folks are

211
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:28,120
doing a very good job with preserving

212
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:31,930
those those original genetics you know I

213
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:37,120
I think that what we've seen since the

214
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:39,250
seed bank is a is a one really great

215
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,589
thing right which is that the overall

216
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:44,019
quality of cannabis around the world is

217
00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:46,329
much much much higher than it ever was

218
00:08:44,019 --> 00:08:47,860
before right over the course of the last

219
00:08:46,328 --> 00:08:50,349
three decades the can

220
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:52,629
this consumer has been exposed to much

221
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:54,519
higher quality of cannabis steadily

222
00:08:52,629 --> 00:08:56,379
increasing quality of cannabis and

223
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:58,539
that's a great thing but what's also

224
00:08:56,379 --> 00:09:00,070
happened along the way is is that

225
00:08:58,539 --> 00:09:02,549
there's just been a huge amount of

226
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:05,470
genetic crossbreeding and hybridization

227
00:09:02,549 --> 00:09:08,109
until there's an awful lot of strains

228
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:09,910
out there that are awfully much like

229
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:11,589
everything else that's out there that

230
00:09:09,909 --> 00:09:14,439
don't have a lot of distinctive

231
00:09:11,589 --> 00:09:15,850
character do so nowadays I always tell

232
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:18,220
people if they're gonna bring me flour

233
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:19,720
and I have to ration myself smoking

234
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:22,660
flour because I've smoked so much flour

235
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:25,629
in my life my lungs are bearing the load

236
00:09:22,659 --> 00:09:27,338
right laughter it's got to be really

237
00:09:25,629 --> 00:09:29,950
special right so I always tell people

238
00:09:27,339 --> 00:09:32,950
bring me the ugly but don't bring me the

239
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:34,870
perfect round dense lovely right I don't

240
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:36,940
want to see that I want to see something

241
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:38,230
ugly right because if it's ugly most

242
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:40,630
likely it's gonna have some kind of

243
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:42,759
distinctive character in there right and

244
00:09:40,629 --> 00:09:45,519
that's and I want to see distinctiveness

245
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:48,850
so I think that we're also seeing a real

246
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:50,649
shift in what people are breeding for

247
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:53,100
right people are becoming more and more

248
00:09:50,649 --> 00:09:56,549
sophisticated so in the early days

249
00:09:53,100 --> 00:10:00,310
breeders didn't have any access to

250
00:09:56,549 --> 00:10:02,500
analytics so the only way that you could

251
00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:04,719
test your product was by seeing how

252
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:06,429
potent it was by trying it and smoking

253
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:09,579
it right well that was good for building

254
00:10:06,429 --> 00:10:11,828
your THC content but not very good for

255
00:10:09,578 --> 00:10:13,659
any of the other 400 cannabinoids or

256
00:10:11,828 --> 00:10:14,979
hundreds of different terpenes that are

257
00:10:13,659 --> 00:10:19,509
out there right definitely

258
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:21,550
so a story that illustrates that when I

259
00:10:19,509 --> 00:10:23,528
was a co-founder steep hill laboratory

260
00:10:21,549 --> 00:10:26,588
the first cannabis analytics laboratory

261
00:10:23,528 --> 00:10:28,689
and when we ran our first 2,000 samples

262
00:10:26,589 --> 00:10:30,940
of cannabis from California's medical

263
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:33,790
cannabis market all came from Harborside

264
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:38,970
only ten of them had measurable

265
00:10:33,789 --> 00:10:41,588
quantities of CBD really ten right why

266
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:43,959
because every grower was trying to

267
00:10:41,589 --> 00:10:45,579
maximize their revenue and the way that

268
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:48,129
you maximize your revenue is by

269
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:50,620
maximizing your potency and in the

270
00:10:48,129 --> 00:10:52,480
process of maximizing potency without

271
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:56,190
even knowing what they were doing people

272
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:59,629
selected out CBD from the genetic pool

273
00:10:56,190 --> 00:11:02,210
so the Harlequins the Suzie Q's

274
00:10:59,629 --> 00:11:04,279
the Charlotte's Web I mean the ac/dc s

275
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:06,680
I'm a medical advocate and having for

276
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:08,059
your cancer survivor so I do look at it

277
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:10,069
from a medicinal standpoint I've always

278
00:11:08,059 --> 00:11:11,719
been a fan of either high CBD s or at

279
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:13,640
least a one to one right to get a bit of

280
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:15,200
that body of mine so those just weren't

281
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:17,299
weren't the thing because they had been

282
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:20,720
weaned out so much to your point through

283
00:11:17,299 --> 00:11:24,859
the 80s the 90s this whole we had we had

284
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:28,160
we had to build CBD back into the

285
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:31,190
cannabis genetics pool right it wasn't

286
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:33,889
there everybody had been selecting for

287
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:36,020
high potency and had just inadvertently

288
00:11:33,889 --> 00:11:38,990
without even knowing it without trying

289
00:11:36,019 --> 00:11:42,289
to had eliminated basically eliminated

290
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:44,509
CBD and that was that was disturbing to

291
00:11:42,289 --> 00:11:46,699
me because like you I understood the

292
00:11:44,509 --> 00:11:48,139
therapeutic implications of that right

293
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:50,090
and that there that there would be

294
00:11:48,139 --> 00:11:53,779
millions of people who would not get the

295
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:56,720
profound therapeutic benefits of CBD and

296
00:11:53,779 --> 00:12:00,319
particularly people like children with

297
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:02,060
intractable epilepsy right so we

298
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:05,600
actually had to do it things that we

299
00:12:02,059 --> 00:12:08,569
didn't ever do in any other program in

300
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:11,170
order to get CBD back into the genetics

301
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:13,640
right so when I first went to growers

302
00:12:11,169 --> 00:12:15,319
like after we got these results I was

303
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:17,659
like oh my god I got to get more flowers

304
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:19,100
to grow CBD rich cannabis right so I go

305
00:12:17,659 --> 00:12:21,079
to them and I would say hey I want you

306
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:24,019
to grow this cannabis that's rich in CBD

307
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:26,450
and they would be like dude what are you

308
00:12:24,019 --> 00:12:28,879
you want me to grow with it doesn't get

309
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:30,560
you high what happens if you get raided

310
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:32,600
this is back in George Bush days what

311
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:34,609
happens if you get raided and you're not

312
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:37,430
here and I'm gonna sell the weeds it

313
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:39,500
doesn't get people high so we did

314
00:12:37,429 --> 00:12:42,469
something we never did right which is we

315
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:44,269
paid growers in advance for weed that

316
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:46,850
had not been grown yet so that they

317
00:12:44,269 --> 00:12:49,269
would grow CBD rich cannabis that's what

318
00:12:46,850 --> 00:13:00,379
we had to do in the beginning right

319
00:12:49,269 --> 00:13:00,379
