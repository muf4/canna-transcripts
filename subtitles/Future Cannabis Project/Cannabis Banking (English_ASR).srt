[Music]

2
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:14,969
the conversation we didn't really

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,880
complete is one on banking and that's

4
00:00:14,968 --> 00:00:19,890
why it's a pleasure here to have tim

5
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:22,320
schafer with us the california deputy

6
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:25,230
treasurer public finance I want to share

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:29,160
with everyone what one company wrote me

8
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:33,269
so the this is bloom box and these these

9
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:36,509
folks provide b2b software as product as

10
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:37,980
a service and they said legalization

11
00:00:36,509 --> 00:00:42,229
didn't help us with investment capital

12
00:00:37,979 --> 00:00:46,530
because there's no way to safely bank or

13
00:00:42,229 --> 00:00:48,419
insure these investment funds smaller

14
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:52,020
investors cannot incur risk larger

15
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:56,010
v-type VC type investors are still bound

16
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:57,629
by so-called vice clauses commonly

17
00:00:56,009 --> 00:01:00,509
embedded in their partnership agreements

18
00:00:57,628 --> 00:01:04,048
that prohibit even indirect investments

19
00:01:00,509 --> 00:01:07,530
in federally scheduled substances is

20
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:11,220
this really strictly a Schedule one

21
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:13,859
issue a complex question with an equally

22
00:01:11,219 --> 00:01:20,688
complex answer let me start

23
00:01:13,859 --> 00:01:26,069
let me start start here banking banking

24
00:01:20,688 --> 00:01:28,739
many businesses is a question of a

25
00:01:26,069 --> 00:01:32,069
banker being able to engage in

26
00:01:28,739 --> 00:01:34,140
reasonable risk management let me give

27
00:01:32,069 --> 00:01:39,239
you an example that has nothing to do

28
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:43,549
with cannabis many banks will refuse to

29
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:48,408
open accounts for check cashing services

30
00:01:43,549 --> 00:01:56,390
for horse racing tracks for payday auto

31
00:01:48,409 --> 00:02:03,149
lenders for cardrooms why because often

32
00:01:56,390 --> 00:02:07,259
these organizations can mask occult

33
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:10,430
activities which will create regulatory

34
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:13,530
risk for the bank so they avoid it now

35
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:13,890
notice that it's perfectly legal to be

36
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:15,930
in the

37
00:02:13,889 --> 00:02:18,389
room business or to run a horse racing

38
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:21,300
track assuming you've got licenses from

39
00:02:18,389 --> 00:02:25,439
your locality to do that introduced the

40
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:27,810
notion of cannabis a federally scheduled

41
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:32,430
truck and then the problem begins to

42
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:37,439
metastasize the problem metastasizes in

43
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:41,969
this way in my view bankers are

44
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:45,479
risk-averse and if this is a risk

45
00:02:41,969 --> 00:02:49,680
management business the default position

46
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:52,289
can easily become risk avoidance rather

47
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:56,129
than risk management if there is no

48
00:02:52,289 --> 00:02:59,489
clear pathway to economics that would

49
00:02:56,129 --> 00:03:02,400
work that introduces the next facet of

50
00:02:59,489 --> 00:03:06,000
the risk and that is because there is

51
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:11,759
this growing wave in our nation to

52
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:17,819
discuss cannabis the fact that it may be

53
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:19,560
d scheduled scares the bank's why well

54
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:22,709
because they can set up an apparatus

55
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:25,319
that will require a great deal of

56
00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:28,860
investment only to look up and discover

57
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:31,199
that we're now off schedule 1 and we're

58
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:34,200
back in the same category as a card room

59
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:36,599
or a racetrack and so forth and therein

60
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:39,509
as I think one of the Rubik's cubes that

61
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:42,000
need to be solved one of the things that

62
00:03:39,509 --> 00:03:45,120
I would encourage you all to become

63
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,879
familiar with hezekiah mentioned this in

64
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,709
the last panel is this document right

65
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:51,599
here I'm not going to read it to you

66
00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:54,539
it's available in a state treasurer's

67
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:57,030
website the title of it is banking

68
00:03:54,539 --> 00:03:57,900
access strategies for cannabis related

69
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:00,030
businesses

70
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:02,430
I can give you just a few seconds of

71
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:07,500
what the four primary recommendations

72
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:11,040
are first at least for the here and now

73
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:13,949
develop a system that will accommodate

74
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:16,649
the cash industry rather than trying to

75
00:04:13,949 --> 00:04:18,629
force it into the business figure out a

76
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:20,578
way to accommodate the cash industry a

77
00:04:18,629 --> 00:04:23,310
little bit better than we're doing we

78
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:25,980
call that inside the office the armored

79
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:28,680
car bus route strategy

80
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:30,960
number 38 bus run by Brinks that makes

81
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:34,949
us scheduled stop everywhere and picks

82
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:39,169
up currency to pay taxes and fees to the

83
00:04:34,949 --> 00:04:42,180
state to the local agencies number to

84
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:44,390
develop a data portal those of you who

85
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:50,040
are familiar with the Washington system

86
00:04:44,389 --> 00:04:53,250
know that the cannabis control mechanism

87
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:56,550
in that state are are figuratively

88
00:04:53,250 --> 00:05:00,449
speaking kind of bolted on the framework

89
00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:05,400
that was used for liquor control number

90
00:05:00,449 --> 00:05:08,819
three investigate the feasibility of

91
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:11,549
establishing a state backed financial

92
00:05:08,819 --> 00:05:15,120
institution that would cater to or

93
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:16,439
accommodate the industry I hope I get

94
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,720
questions on that later

95
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:22,680
and then finally in this to me is the

96
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:27,540
big one develop a consortium of bankers

97
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:29,430
regulators cannabis industry folks the

98
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:33,860
stakeholders that were discussed in the

99
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:38,000
last panel that our medical customers

100
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:41,550
put them together in a group that will

101
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:45,560
devote some energy and time to lobbying

102
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:48,870
federal legislators and federal

103
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:50,370
regulators about the evolving nature of

104
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:53,730
it those are the four things you'll see

105
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:57,600
in their report and we're underway with

106
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:59,100
each of those four now and I grieve to

107
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,470
him I think if I can add a little

108
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:03,720
perspective from the bank side up about

109
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:05,100
a year and a half ago I ran America's

110
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:07,320
fastest-growing Bank for a period of

111
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:09,560
three years we grew from not 1.9 billion

112
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:11,310
over 13 billion that period of time

113
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:13,319
aggregating to pause is the most

114
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:15,540
difficult thing that's possible if you

115
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:18,300
take a look at it you've got to if you

116
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:19,860
have a perspective a asking for deposits

117
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:21,780
or giving a loan obviously asking for

118
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:23,490
deposits more challenging so we need to

119
00:06:21,779 --> 00:06:27,389
take higher risk strategies that involve

120
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:29,550
eb-5 broker-dealer cash businesses the

121
00:06:27,389 --> 00:06:32,759
the regulators are spent approximately

122
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:35,670
half of the year so about 150 business

123
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:37,490
days in our offices and again measuring

124
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:39,750
and analyzing our high-risk businesses

125
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:41,670
banks themselves can hold 20

126
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:43,889
five percent typically if it's well-run

127
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:46,770
of their collective deposit base in

128
00:06:43,889 --> 00:06:48,959
high-risk and what that means is it's a

129
00:06:46,769 --> 00:06:50,759
fight for what high-risk deposits can

130
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:52,529
actually sit on that balance sheet so

131
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:54,870
with that comes in here and risk the ten

132
00:06:52,529 --> 00:06:55,859
mention so and again if you take a look

133
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:56,850
at the smaller banks that are

134
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:58,290
participating they're about three

135
00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:00,180
hundred banks across us right now that

136
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:02,879
actually actively engage in cannabis

137
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:04,319
business to actually have a kyc an AML

138
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:06,600
program and BSA program that facilitates

139
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:08,399
it actually costs tens of thousands of

140
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:10,020
dollars if not hundreds and on top of

141
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:11,729
that if you look at these smaller banks

142
00:07:10,019 --> 00:07:13,319
they don't have the technology some of

143
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:15,360
the core processing solutions to

144
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:16,649
actually interpret and understand

145
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,660
exactly where that money is coming from

146
00:07:16,649 --> 00:07:20,489
so that entire process on an ongoing

147
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:21,660
basis ends up costing hundreds of

148
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:23,370
thousands of dollars because you need

149
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:25,470
personnel and staff to actually manage

150
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:26,639
that as well so that's the main

151
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:28,860
challenge that they're having in to

152
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:31,199
Tim's point it is very challenging and

153
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:32,819
the natural mentality the banker can be

154
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,709
risk averse the other side of this

155
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:38,040
challenge is the actual payment side so

156
00:07:34,709 --> 00:07:39,689
if we think about Visa MasterCard AB in

157
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:41,370
basically is where all the transactions

158
00:07:39,689 --> 00:07:43,649
pass through if you think of every

159
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:46,139
hundred dollars it passes through AB in

160
00:07:43,649 --> 00:07:47,668
only one dollar can actually be high

161
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:50,219
risk related and so by definition

162
00:07:47,668 --> 00:07:51,659
cannabis is high risk so we also need to

163
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:53,370
come up with additional payment

164
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:55,110
mechanisms that will help evolve

165
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:57,930
industry so it's not only just a cash

166
00:07:55,110 --> 00:08:01,740
business lately I've been saying that

167
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:03,629
we're we have two policies at play one

168
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:08,310
is to allow cannabis and the other is

169
00:08:03,629 --> 00:08:11,310
prohibited and the it's impossible to

170
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:13,470
move forward unless one is gonna win and

171
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:15,209
so we're back to you have to organize

172
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:17,310
you you have to go to the legislature

173
00:08:15,209 --> 00:08:20,370
the courts aren't gonna help you have to

174
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:23,220
actually force this issue and the

175
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:24,720
absurdity of the contradictions between

176
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:27,020
what is really happening and what the

177
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,910
population in this country wants and

178
00:08:27,019 --> 00:08:32,668
ultimately Congress has to do something

179
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:34,560
about it that's my perspective I've gone

180
00:08:32,668 --> 00:08:36,240
back and forth with Fiona and other

181
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,218
folks in the state government about a

182
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:41,158
bank and well it's a really wonderful

183
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:43,530
idea and I support it there's just too

184
00:08:41,158 --> 00:08:45,600
many I think too many barriers because

185
00:08:43,529 --> 00:08:47,850
of federal prohibition to allow it so

186
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,070
until we get Congress to do something

187
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:52,379
and this is just an old song and I feel

188
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:53,590
kind of stupid keep bringing it up but

189
00:08:52,379 --> 00:08:55,779
until we you know

190
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:57,220
get our congresspeople to actually do

191
00:08:55,779 --> 00:08:59,949
something about it and organize

192
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:02,170
effectively rather than the old

193
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:04,000
left-wing firing squad you know that

194
00:09:02,169 --> 00:09:06,849
joke how does the left-wing firing squad

195
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,529
line up in a circle and so you know

196
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:11,170
everyone's gonna have to learn how to

197
00:09:08,529 --> 00:09:13,179
organize and work together put the egos

198
00:09:11,169 --> 00:09:14,559
aside and then we got to go to Congress

199
00:09:13,179 --> 00:09:19,029
because that's where ultimately I think

200
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:21,639
this has to get fixed from personal

201
00:09:19,029 --> 00:09:24,549
experience our companies we've lost two

202
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:26,529
bank accounts just this month one of the

203
00:09:24,549 --> 00:09:28,359
reasons was we deposited more than five

204
00:09:26,529 --> 00:09:30,519
thousand dollars per month

205
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:32,200
into the account which as a business

206
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:34,299
owner having five thousand dollars

207
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:36,009
deposited in cash it's not a lot of

208
00:09:34,299 --> 00:09:38,589
money especially in a cash business and

209
00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:41,200
the other was because even though we're

210
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:43,420
a non plant touching business we accept

211
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,940
money from plant touching businesses and

212
00:09:43,419 --> 00:09:48,490
that account was subsequently shut down

213
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:50,050
and right now I'm gonna have to talk and

214
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:52,659
find one of those three hundred banks

215
00:09:50,049 --> 00:09:55,059
because I have tried to open new bank

216
00:09:52,659 --> 00:09:58,529
accounts and we have to put our website

217
00:09:55,059 --> 00:10:01,239
down our website mentions cannabis and

218
00:09:58,529 --> 00:10:02,799
we have been unable so far we've only

219
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,779
tried this week but we've been unable to

220
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:07,299
open a new bank account which is very

221
00:10:04,779 --> 00:10:09,519
discouraging especially for someone who

222
00:10:07,299 --> 00:10:11,199
has to run a business so we'll see you

223
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:13,179
know what changes we can man I've been

224
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,250
have to read that report too but

225
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:17,799
hopefully these rules can change quickly

226
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:20,350
because it's it's that's one more

227
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:22,839
deterrent to run in a cannabis business

228
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:24,730
on top of all of everything else thank

229
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:27,040
you this is also a huge challenge I

230
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:29,620
don't think that banks have an incentive

231
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:31,480
to enter into this space because they

232
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:33,190
the the way that they grow their

233
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:36,129
revenues through acquisitions of other

234
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:39,100
banks and so they don't want to

235
00:10:36,129 --> 00:10:40,990
jeopardize those acquisitions by

236
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:45,240
entering into cannabis space so they're

237
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:49,570
deferring and and staying away from that

238
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:53,139
and no I'm from Portland Oregon

239
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:55,870
so in Oregon we have two main credit

240
00:10:53,139 --> 00:10:57,850
unions that provide banking services

241
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:59,089
checking and savings five hundred

242
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:01,399
dollars a month for it

243
00:10:59,089 --> 00:11:04,759
and savings account and that's to cover

244
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:08,208
the costs but they only have 600

245
00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:10,969
accounts total and there's over 4,400

246
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:13,578
businesses in Oregon right now that are

247
00:11:10,969 --> 00:11:15,559
cannabis related so that's the kind of

248
00:11:13,578 --> 00:11:18,408
draws a picture of or paints a picture

249
00:11:15,558 --> 00:11:20,509
of just the extent of how little banking

250
00:11:18,408 --> 00:11:21,210
is offered to the canvas industry right

251
00:11:20,509 --> 00:11:40,690
now

252
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:40,690
