[Music]

2
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:18,929
Dave this is your waning days now is the

3
00:00:16,829 --> 00:00:20,969
Insurance Commissioner and I have met

4
00:00:18,929 --> 00:00:22,439
you as a lawyer coming to provide

5
00:00:20,969 --> 00:00:24,570
professional services to the cannabis

6
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:26,698
industry I've worked with you in your

7
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:29,670
office a lot to try to bring insurance

8
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:32,789
to that marketplace maybe just give

9
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:34,260
folks a sense of what the California

10
00:00:32,789 --> 00:00:36,210
Department of Insurance has been doing

11
00:00:34,259 --> 00:00:38,579
what your goal has been and sort of what

12
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:40,789
the success stories sort of look like in

13
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:43,679
that in that arena when the voters

14
00:00:40,789 --> 00:00:46,619
decided to legalize adult recreational

15
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:48,628
use of cannabis I immediately set up to

16
00:00:46,619 --> 00:00:50,099
make sure there's insurance available

17
00:00:48,628 --> 00:00:52,649
for the industry I want to make sure

18
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:55,079
that the second of consumer walks into a

19
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:57,090
cannabis retailer the second and

20
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:59,250
employee works for a cannabis business

21
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:00,899
the second a seller of goods and

22
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:02,729
services a vendor to the cannabis

23
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:04,948
industry sells a product that there's

24
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:07,379
insurance to cover all of those various

25
00:01:04,948 --> 00:01:09,149
ways in which consumers workers

26
00:01:07,379 --> 00:01:11,158
businesses investors owners and

27
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:12,780
operators interact with the cannabis

28
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:14,368
supply chain that's my mission as

29
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,109
Insurance Commissioner insurance

30
00:01:14,368 --> 00:01:18,209
protection for all Californians the

31
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:22,228
challenge of course is that you're

32
00:01:18,209 --> 00:01:23,368
talking about a newly legalized industry

33
00:01:22,228 --> 00:01:25,920
for which there isn't a lot of

34
00:01:23,368 --> 00:01:27,569
experience so we've done everything we

35
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,759
can to try to encourage the carrier's to

36
00:01:27,569 --> 00:01:31,289
come into this space including meetings

37
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,299
you've attended where we've brought

38
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:35,159
together insurance company executives

39
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:37,049
with leaders from the cannabis industry

40
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:39,170
so the executives can better understand

41
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:41,009
the degree of risk management

42
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:43,079
transparency and professionalism of the

43
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:45,329
cannabis industry I've led tours of

44
00:01:43,078 --> 00:01:47,009
major cannabis businesses with senior

45
00:01:45,328 --> 00:01:49,199
underwriters from insurance companies so

46
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:50,879
they can see firsthand how the cannabis

47
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,469
industry works its degree of

48
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:53,969
professionalism risk management and

49
00:01:52,469 --> 00:01:57,118
transparency we all diverse to the

50
00:01:53,969 --> 00:01:58,408
nation public hearing to highlight where

51
00:01:57,118 --> 00:02:00,269
there are insurance gaps and where we

52
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:02,670
need insurers to come in and we've had

53
00:02:00,269 --> 00:02:04,438
some success we got the first admitted

54
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:06,600
carrier in the nation Golden Bear a

55
00:02:04,438 --> 00:02:09,359
California company to begin writing last

56
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:11,189
year since then we have Continental

57
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,860
heritage which is offering a products

58
00:02:11,189 --> 00:02:15,689
liability product California mutual

59
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,510
is now offering a product for those

60
00:02:15,689 --> 00:02:20,699
landlords that are leasing to and it's

61
00:02:18,509 --> 00:02:23,159
well we have about thirty surplus lines

62
00:02:20,699 --> 00:02:24,750
some writers that are writing as well so

63
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:27,359
we're excited about the growth of this

64
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:28,530
market I think it's only going to get

65
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,960
better over time but there are

66
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:32,939
challenges so you spoke to the

67
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:36,240
challenges that lie ahead for the the

68
00:02:32,939 --> 00:02:38,520
industry for for folks that are in the

69
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:41,700
insurance markets for folks in the

70
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:43,920
cannabis industry what what do you see

71
00:02:41,699 --> 00:02:45,389
those sort of challenges are if you have

72
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:47,849
any thoughts about how they sort of

73
00:02:45,389 --> 00:02:48,989
overcome those and maybe what do you see

74
00:02:47,849 --> 00:02:50,459
in the days ahead of what do you hope to

75
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:51,840
see in the days ahead in terms of the

76
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:54,629
insurance markets coming to this space

77
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:57,719
so I think the upside for the insurance

78
00:02:54,629 --> 00:02:59,909
industry is very very positive there's a

79
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:01,500
tremendous demand and the cannabis

80
00:02:59,909 --> 00:03:03,840
industry is only going to continue to

81
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:07,189
grow in California and elsewhere the

82
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:10,110
challenge is the continued federal

83
00:03:07,189 --> 00:03:12,239
schedule of cannabis as an illegal

84
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:14,250
substance and that has caused some

85
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,930
hesitancy amongst some of the carriers

86
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:18,569
what I tell the insurance company

87
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:20,969
executives is I think the risk is zero

88
00:03:18,569 --> 00:03:22,500
of federal intervention there's no

89
00:03:20,969 --> 00:03:24,719
recorded case where the federal

90
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:26,099
government has investigated or taken

91
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:27,900
some enforcement action against

92
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:29,280
insurance company writing for cannabis

93
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,930
and we're already starting to see

94
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,969
admitted carriers come into this space

95
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:35,099
so but that is the one thing that's

96
00:03:32,969 --> 00:03:38,400
still out there I think as we see more

97
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:40,919
States fully legalized cannabis as we

98
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,739
see our neighbors to the north Canada

99
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:45,000
fully legalizing I think we're gonna see

100
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:46,739
the federal government ultimately change

101
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,569
too but my hope is the insurance

102
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:50,430
industry doesn't wait for that because

103
00:03:48,569 --> 00:03:52,169
there's a demand now and this is an

104
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:53,939
industry that's going to be very loyal

105
00:03:52,169 --> 00:03:55,169
to those that are willing to come in

106
00:03:53,939 --> 00:03:56,969
early and I think there's really

107
00:03:55,169 --> 00:03:58,979
benefits for the insurance industry to

108
00:03:56,969 --> 00:04:01,530
get in now I've definitely seen that

109
00:03:58,979 --> 00:04:04,018
from the legal perspective being a firm

110
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:05,509
one the first full-service national law

111
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:07,920
firm to come into the space and say

112
00:04:05,509 --> 00:04:09,810
we're comfortable doing business with

113
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:15,259
this industry those companies that that

114
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:18,269
see you there early like that they

115
00:04:15,259 --> 00:04:19,379
respect that they'll go back to you and

116
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:20,699
do business so I think that's a great

117
00:04:19,379 --> 00:04:22,589
message for insurance carriers and if

118
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:23,939
you are first to market there are going

119
00:04:22,589 --> 00:04:26,279
to be loyalty and that

120
00:04:23,939 --> 00:04:28,379
respect one of the things that I've

121
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:30,000
started to learn and sort of sense as

122
00:04:28,379 --> 00:04:32,250
I've been doing more work within this

123
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,509
industry is that it's getting bigger and

124
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:35,339
it's starting to become something that's

125
00:04:33,509 --> 00:04:37,170
looked at it's a global market obviously

126
00:04:35,339 --> 00:04:38,789
there's some complications there when

127
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:40,770
you're talking about US companies but

128
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:41,990
certainly there's Canadian concerns that

129
00:04:40,769 --> 00:04:44,549
are putting money into the US market

130
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:46,319
there are US companies that are going to

131
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:48,240
the Canadian markets to go public for

132
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:50,430
example or do fundraising there's

133
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,889
obviously going to be trade happening I

134
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:54,810
think the industry there's a lot of

135
00:04:52,889 --> 00:04:56,250
actors in the industry that that want to

136
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:57,990
be in multiple jurisdictions that want

137
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:59,279
to be in multiple countries and I know

138
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:00,870
that you've been doing work to basically

139
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:02,639
take all the work that you've done here

140
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:04,949
in California and try to export that and

141
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:07,199
really teach people sort of the success

142
00:05:04,949 --> 00:05:09,389
stories of what's worked here what has

143
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,259
it maybe just speak to that about what

144
00:05:09,389 --> 00:05:11,699
you're doing with the National

145
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:13,829
Association of Insurance Commissioner is

146
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:15,389
sort of what the receptiveness has been

147
00:05:13,829 --> 00:05:16,680
in other states or other jurisdictions

148
00:05:15,389 --> 00:05:18,870
to sort of talking about this issues

149
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:21,449
outside of California so insurance

150
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:23,220
unlike every other financial product is

151
00:05:21,449 --> 00:05:25,949
regulated at the state level so we have

152
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:27,150
a national system of state regulation

153
00:05:25,949 --> 00:05:29,668
they're Insurance Commissioners in all

154
00:05:27,149 --> 00:05:32,129
50 states and in the six territories and

155
00:05:29,668 --> 00:05:34,379
as more and more states legalize

156
00:05:32,129 --> 00:05:36,839
cannabis in one way shape or form

157
00:05:34,379 --> 00:05:39,300
all of them are facing the need for

158
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:41,639
insurance in their markets so what I

159
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:43,350
proposed to our National Association of

160
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:45,000
Insurance Commissioners which is the

161
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:47,640
body that sets the standards for

162
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,560
insurance regulation for commissioners

163
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:51,779
throughout the nation was that we form a

164
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:53,310
cannabis insurance working group so that

165
00:05:51,779 --> 00:05:55,739
we could learn what's happening in each

166
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:57,990
state's market learn what regulators are

167
00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:00,210
doing to try to foster more insurance

168
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:01,918
companies to come into the market and so

169
00:06:00,209 --> 00:06:03,479
that we could take some of the positive

170
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:05,519
results we've had here in California and

171
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:07,259
share those with other states so we have

172
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:09,449
formed that working group I was

173
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:11,730
appointed it's chair and we're very

174
00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:14,189
excited and the level of participation

175
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:16,590
from the other states has been fantastic

176
00:06:14,189 --> 00:06:19,199
we have some 30 or so other states

177
00:06:16,589 --> 00:06:21,689
commissioners eager to be involved in

178
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,459
one way shape or form our objective is

179
00:06:21,689 --> 00:06:25,860
to prepare what's called a white paper

180
00:06:23,459 --> 00:06:27,870
which will lay out what the availability

181
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:29,280
is where the insurance gaps are where

182
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:31,978
the opportunities are for the insurance

183
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:33,959
industry but also more importantly what

184
00:06:31,978 --> 00:06:35,788
are the things that regulators can do to

185
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:37,568
encourage more insurance companies and

186
00:06:35,788 --> 00:06:39,728
surplus lines writers to

187
00:06:37,569 --> 00:06:41,580
this space we really appreciate the help

188
00:06:39,728 --> 00:06:44,288
of the National cannabis Industry

189
00:06:41,579 --> 00:06:46,209
Association as well as the California

190
00:06:44,288 --> 00:06:47,740
cannabis Industry Association they're

191
00:06:46,209 --> 00:06:49,619
helping us put together some of the

192
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:52,149
background information we need to

193
00:06:49,619 --> 00:06:54,669
identify where the gaps are state by

194
00:06:52,149 --> 00:06:56,139
state we're gonna have our next national

195
00:06:54,668 --> 00:06:58,269
meeting of Insurance Commissioners in

196
00:06:56,139 --> 00:07:00,009
San Francisco in November we'll have a

197
00:06:58,269 --> 00:07:01,269
meeting of the working group we're

198
00:07:00,009 --> 00:07:03,338
excited that we're gonna have a number

199
00:07:01,269 --> 00:07:04,838
of cannabis industry leaders testifying

200
00:07:03,338 --> 00:07:06,158
there and I think for some insurance

201
00:07:04,838 --> 00:07:08,259
commissioners this will be their first

202
00:07:06,158 --> 00:07:09,968
opportunity to really hear directly from

203
00:07:08,259 --> 00:07:11,649
the cannabis industry what their needs

204
00:07:09,968 --> 00:07:15,338
are so we're excited about that too

205
00:07:11,649 --> 00:07:17,889
beyond that just anecdotally if a lawyer

206
00:07:15,338 --> 00:07:20,228
in another state or an operator in

207
00:07:17,889 --> 00:07:22,930
another state or a broker or a carrier

208
00:07:20,228 --> 00:07:24,459
of the state is watching this and want

209
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:26,459
wants to know how to sort of influence

210
00:07:24,459 --> 00:07:29,079
that or become a part of that discussion

211
00:07:26,459 --> 00:07:30,519
outside of joining CCI our NCI a how

212
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:32,618
would you recommend that they get their

213
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:35,019
voice sort of heard with commissioners

214
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:37,179
in your state or in other states well I

215
00:07:35,019 --> 00:07:40,959
think certainly NCI a and C CI a are

216
00:07:37,178 --> 00:07:42,609
great platforms for all professionals

217
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:44,680
and all entrepreneurs and business

218
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:48,399
owners and operators in this space and I

219
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:51,639
would encourage brokers and lawyers to

220
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:53,319
get involved with the CCI a working

221
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:55,139
group which is focused specifically on

222
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:57,519
insurance it has insurance professionals

223
00:07:55,139 --> 00:08:00,999
lawyers like yourself and others from

224
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:03,369
Wilson Elser as well as brokers like

225
00:08:00,999 --> 00:08:05,169
next-gen and others that are actively in

226
00:08:03,369 --> 00:08:07,029
this space so getting involved with that

227
00:08:05,168 --> 00:08:08,829
working group is a way to learn but as

228
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:11,319
well there's been some really good

229
00:08:08,829 --> 00:08:12,309
online information that's provided the

230
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:16,718
National Association of Insurance

231
00:08:12,309 --> 00:08:19,779
Commissioners has a Center on insurance

232
00:08:16,718 --> 00:08:22,088
research which did a webinar just the

233
00:08:19,778 --> 00:08:23,889
other month that your partner Ian

234
00:08:22,088 --> 00:08:26,019
Stewart participated in as well as

235
00:08:23,889 --> 00:08:28,119
Golden Bear insurance company and me

236
00:08:26,019 --> 00:08:30,610
representing the regulators and that

237
00:08:28,119 --> 00:08:32,560
provides a great overview of some of the

238
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:35,379
recent developments in this space so go

239
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:38,528
to the NAIC org website plug in cannabis

240
00:08:35,379 --> 00:08:43,240
you can find a recording a video of this

241
00:08:38,528 --> 00:08:44,528
online webinar and plunge right in can

242
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:46,448
you maybe speak to sort of one of the

243
00:08:44,528 --> 00:08:48,250
more recent developments and insurance

244
00:08:46,448 --> 00:08:48,649
availability specific to this cannabis

245
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,809
and is

246
00:08:48,649 --> 00:08:52,759
so we've been really excited as I said

247
00:08:50,809 --> 00:08:54,528
we were able to get the first admitted

248
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:58,129
carrier in the country Golden Bear

249
00:08:54,528 --> 00:09:00,019
insurance company to begin writing and

250
00:08:58,129 --> 00:09:03,799
to file with our department a general

251
00:09:00,019 --> 00:09:05,720
business liability product as well we've

252
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:07,429
seen a number of other admitted carriers

253
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,680
come into the space Continental heritage

254
00:09:07,429 --> 00:09:10,370
is now writing a products liability

255
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:12,709
product that we've approved in

256
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:14,960
California California mutual insurance

257
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:17,660
company is writing a insurance product

258
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:19,490
for landlords of cannabis businesses

259
00:09:17,659 --> 00:09:21,379
we've had a number of companies we've

260
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:23,930
approved to write surety bonds which is

261
00:09:21,379 --> 00:09:26,059
a requirement of our state licensing

262
00:09:23,929 --> 00:09:27,769
regime for cannabis businesses and

263
00:09:26,059 --> 00:09:29,359
another important development is the

264
00:09:27,769 --> 00:09:32,329
American Association of Insurance

265
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:35,089
Services AAA is which is what's called

266
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:38,389
an insurance service organization they

267
00:09:35,089 --> 00:09:40,100
prepared a standardized policy form that

268
00:09:38,389 --> 00:09:42,528
can be used by their members kind of

269
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:44,509
plug-and-play they filed it with us

270
00:09:42,528 --> 00:09:46,129
we've approved it that's a great

271
00:09:44,509 --> 00:09:47,960
development because now insurance

272
00:09:46,129 --> 00:09:49,009
companies that are members of a EIS

273
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,930
don't have to reinvent the wheel

274
00:09:49,009 --> 00:09:54,860
themselves they can take what's called

275
00:09:50,929 --> 00:09:56,479
the cannibal policy program and begin to

276
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:58,009
write right away so we're really excited

277
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,350
about these developments I think there's

278
00:09:58,009 --> 00:10:01,610
more to come and I'm continuing to be

279
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:04,220
out there encouraging encouraging

280
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:06,769
couraging more companies more surplus

281
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:09,410
lines writers to get into this space the

282
00:10:06,769 --> 00:10:11,750
cannabis operator that's out there why

283
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:13,309
do they care about what the Department

284
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:16,190
of Insurance is doing why do they care

285
00:10:13,309 --> 00:10:18,139
whether there's surplus lines insurance

286
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:20,270
versus admitted carriers involved like

287
00:10:18,139 --> 00:10:21,470
maybe speak to them about why it's

288
00:10:20,269 --> 00:10:23,240
important that they really get involved

289
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:25,360
to see that this all develops in a way

290
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:29,139
that benefits them so like any other

291
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:32,600
industry the cannabis industry faces

292
00:10:29,139 --> 00:10:34,610
financial risks insurance is a great way

293
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:36,409
to mitigate those risks and to protect

294
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:38,240
yourself from loss you know we had some

295
00:10:36,409 --> 00:10:40,759
of the worst wildfires for example in

296
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:43,730
the state's history in 2017 and there

297
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:45,620
was a grower in Northern California that

298
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:48,200
purchased an insurance policy from a

299
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:49,759
surplus lines writer and thankfully they

300
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,528
had that policy because even though

301
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:55,580
their product was heavily impacted by

302
00:10:51,528 --> 00:10:57,860
ash and other various particulate matter

303
00:10:55,580 --> 00:11:00,680
thrown up by the fire they were able to

304
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:01,879
recover against that policy and help to

305
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:04,039
cushion the blow

306
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:06,409
of the fire on their business that's

307
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:09,259
just one example so the reason why

308
00:11:06,409 --> 00:11:11,029
cannabis businesses should be supportive

309
00:11:09,259 --> 00:11:12,620
of what we're doing is because it's in

310
00:11:11,029 --> 00:11:14,600
their interest to get more insurance

311
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:16,820
companies to write the reason we want

312
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:19,250
more admitted carriers to write is that

313
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:21,320
those are the traditional insurance

314
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:22,759
writers and with their entry in the

315
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:26,090
market you're gonna get more

316
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:28,069
standardization more capacity and better

317
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:29,990
pricing now that's not to take anything

318
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:32,090
away from the surplus lines writers

319
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:33,320
which is the the additional market

320
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:35,690
that's out there right now and the

321
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:38,240
surplus lines brokers they're doing a

322
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:40,400
yeoman's job of providing insurance

323
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,950
coverage when it wasn't available before

324
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:45,379
and so we're excited about them too but

325
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:47,330
as this market matures we'd like to see

326
00:11:45,379 --> 00:11:49,490
more admitted carriers come in along

327
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:51,440
with the surplus lines writers so that

328
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:53,600
it becomes a more mature market we have

329
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,910
greater availability greater capacity a

330
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:58,759
better pricing for the cannabis industry

331
00:11:55,909 --> 00:12:00,289
more competition that's the key so one

332
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:04,909
of the challenges that's obviously going

333
00:12:00,289 --> 00:12:06,639
to face this this convergence of

334
00:12:04,909 --> 00:12:08,870
insurance in cannabis is going to be

335
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,840
insurance carriers trying to measure the

336
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:13,460
risk and figure out how to write it

337
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:15,590
cannabis industry operators buying

338
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:17,450
insurance products and then claims are

339
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:18,950
going to hit and variable there's going

340
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:20,810
to be some disputes about what's covered

341
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:23,629
what's not how those claims are gonna be

342
00:12:20,809 --> 00:12:26,299
handled obviously your office is right

343
00:12:23,629 --> 00:12:27,710
there close to the ground on hearing

344
00:12:26,299 --> 00:12:29,870
what the concerns of the industry are

345
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:32,060
what their frustrations or pain points

346
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:33,560
are maybe from your perspective speak to

347
00:12:32,059 --> 00:12:35,239
the industry about sort of what you're

348
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:37,339
hearing and and if you have any creative

349
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,990
thoughts about maybe ways to bridge gaps

350
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:41,720
between the carriers and the and the

351
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:43,100
actual insurance so as Insurance

352
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,450
Commissioner I lead the California

353
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:46,250
Department of Insurance which is a

354
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:49,670
consumer protection agency and a part of

355
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:51,529
our job is to regulate the way in which

356
00:12:49,669 --> 00:12:53,750
the insurance companies respond to

357
00:12:51,529 --> 00:12:56,029
claims we don't adjudicate the claim

358
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:58,370
we're not the judge over the claim but

359
00:12:56,029 --> 00:12:59,839
there's a body of due process law and

360
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:02,060
procedures called the Fair Claims

361
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:03,830
Settlement Practices Act that requires

362
00:13:02,059 --> 00:13:06,219
fairness and reasonableness in the

363
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:08,600
handling of the claim so we get about

364
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:10,339
160,000 calls a year from businesses

365
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:12,500
across all sectors of the economy and

366
00:13:10,339 --> 00:13:14,000
consumers where they have an issue with

367
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,809
their insurance company and we go to bat

368
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,659
take a look at whether

369
00:13:15,809 --> 00:13:20,879
laws been properly followed if it hasn't

370
00:13:18,659 --> 00:13:23,370
then we asked the insurance company to

371
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:26,039
follow the law and we're successful each

372
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:27,299
year in returning hundreds of millions

373
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:30,089
of dollars to consumers that they

374
00:13:27,299 --> 00:13:32,159
wouldn't otherwise get so with regard to

375
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:34,589
cannabis because it is such a new

376
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:36,149
product and a new market there are going

377
00:13:34,589 --> 00:13:37,589
to be these sorts of disputes and

378
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:40,889
insurers themselves are trying to figure

379
00:13:37,589 --> 00:13:42,630
out how best to write these policies you

380
00:13:40,889 --> 00:13:44,730
know it's gonna be a little bit of a

381
00:13:42,629 --> 00:13:46,649
shakeout period we would encourage

382
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:48,269
people to contact us people in the

you're being treated in a fair and

395
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,929
reasonable way we spoke earlier about

396
00:14:10,889 --> 00:14:15,179
you know bringing more product to market

397
00:14:12,929 --> 00:14:17,039
bringing different options pricing

398
00:14:15,179 --> 00:14:19,829
competitiveness I know with your

399
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:21,629
office's help in leadership the the the

400
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:25,320
professionalism in that regard in terms

401
00:14:21,629 --> 00:14:28,470
of what the policies say has really gone

402
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:30,150
a great way during your administration I

403
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:32,370
know we as lawyers that typically

404
00:14:30,149 --> 00:14:33,600
represent insurance companies have been

405
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:35,669
working with them and there's been an

406
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,920
appetite to to get it right so I think

407
00:14:35,669 --> 00:14:39,509
between what your office is doing and

408
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:41,490
what people like myself are doing with

409
00:14:39,509 --> 00:14:43,620
insurance companies to try to get it

410
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:45,870
right to try to get carriers involved in

411
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:47,970
the space that want to insure cannabis

412
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:49,919
are willing to insure cannabis they want

413
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:52,259
to pay a claim when when they are

414
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:53,189
insuring a claim I totally would agree

415
00:14:52,259 --> 00:14:54,330
with you it's gonna take some time to

416
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:55,820
get it right but as long as both parties

417
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:57,990
are sort of part of that conversation

418
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:59,250
only good things could come and it's

419
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:59,639
only going to be better for the industry

420
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:02,000
as a whole

421
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:05,159
and for consumers I agree and I think

422
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,080
really appreciative of your and your law

423
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:09,419
firms and other lawyers that are active

424
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:11,400
in this space and the insurance industry

425
00:15:09,419 --> 00:15:13,860
and the cannabis industry too it's been

426
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:15,149
a real collaborative cooperative

427
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:17,039
to try to make sure that there is

428
00:15:15,149 --> 00:15:19,139
insurance and that the terms of that

429
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:21,208
insurance are clear and explicit so that

430
00:15:19,139 --> 00:15:23,159
cannabis owners and operators know what

431
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:25,139
they're getting and so the insurers know

432
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:26,519
what their obligations are as well and

433
00:15:25,139 --> 00:15:28,750
sometimes there are going to be disputes

434
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:30,279
but I don't think we're having

435
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:32,740
any more disputes that we see anywhere

436
00:15:30,279 --> 00:15:35,730
else and that's pretty significant

437
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:37,690
because this is a new area and so the

438
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:39,850
fact that we don't see even more

439
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:42,070
disputes I think speaks highly of the

440
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:44,259
good faith and the positive way in which

441
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:45,970
lawyers and insurance companies brokers

442
00:15:44,259 --> 00:15:47,259
in the cannabis industry are working

443
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:49,090
together to try to get this right I

444
00:15:47,259 --> 00:15:51,879
really appreciate you saying that

445
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:54,250
I know lawyers and insurance companies

446
00:15:51,879 --> 00:15:56,080
have got terrible reputation inside and

447
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:58,090
outside of cannabis but I think a lot of

448
00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:01,060
cannabis operators view the insurance

449
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:03,160
market with some level of skepticism and

450
00:16:01,059 --> 00:16:05,319
and they see people getting claims

451
00:16:03,159 --> 00:16:08,740
denied or things happening and they sort

452
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:11,050
of view it as oh this is a business

453
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:12,759
world against cannabis but to your point

454
00:16:11,049 --> 00:16:15,449
this stuff happens in every walk of life

455
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:17,620
and and we're just trying

456
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:20,080
yeah they denied claims in every

457
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:21,549
industry so to hear you say that it's

458
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:23,170
you know sort of on par with what you

459
00:16:21,549 --> 00:16:25,059
see everywhere I think it's an important

460
00:16:23,169 --> 00:16:26,829
message for the cannabis industry to

461
00:16:25,059 --> 00:16:28,059
hear so they don't get discouraged by it

462
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:30,190
that they stay engaged that they

463
00:16:28,059 --> 00:16:31,689
continue to have a voice and and stay

464
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:33,610
engaged in the conversation about how we

465
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:36,040
make this insurance market more mature

466
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:37,360
and more sophisticated to serve them and

467
00:16:36,039 --> 00:16:38,529
protect the consumers throughout

468
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,669
California that are getting these

469
00:16:38,529 --> 00:16:41,559
products that are coming out of this

470
00:16:39,669 --> 00:16:43,329
market so I just want to say I really

471
00:16:41,559 --> 00:16:45,129
appreciate everything that your office

472
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:47,170
has been doing and and will continue to

473
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:48,939
do through the end of your term your

474
00:16:47,169 --> 00:16:51,250
staffs been wonderful I hope that your

475
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:54,339
successor will continue to stay engaged

476
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:55,899
will continue to do the things that need

477
00:16:54,339 --> 00:16:58,240
to be done to make sure that this

478
00:16:55,899 --> 00:17:00,100
industry has those protections because

479
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:02,259
without it it's not a safe environment

480
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:03,580
for not just the businesses but the

481
00:17:02,259 --> 00:17:05,140
consumers throughout California so I

482
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:06,189
really wanted to say I appreciate on

483
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:08,650
your approach to this your

484
00:17:06,189 --> 00:17:10,480
professionalism and your staffs really

485
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:12,579
willingness to cooperate with not only

486
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,049
the lawyers in the space not only the

487
00:17:12,578 --> 00:17:15,970
insurance carriers in the space but the

488
00:17:14,049 --> 00:17:18,099
operators as well thank you I've made it

489
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:20,740
a real priority of my commissioner ship

490
00:17:18,099 --> 00:17:22,208
and have devoted substantial resources

491
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:24,068
and staff time to it because it's

492
00:17:22,209 --> 00:17:26,318
important yep I want to make sure that

493
00:17:24,068 --> 00:17:28,568
anytime anybody goes into a cannabis

494
00:17:26,318 --> 00:17:29,920
retail facility there's insurance to

495
00:17:28,568 --> 00:17:31,240
cover that person I want to make sure

496
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,980
when someone works for a cannabis

497
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:34,990
businesses insurance when someone owns

498
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:37,179
or operates again if there's insurance

499
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:39,549
this industry needs to be covered just

500
00:17:37,179 --> 00:17:42,490
like any other industry because it is a

501
00:17:39,549 --> 00:17:44,849
legitimate business in California

502
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:46,960
and we've done everything we can to

503
00:17:44,849 --> 00:17:49,689
institutionalize this approach and to

504
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:51,910
take it national so I'm confident that

505
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:54,190
my successor whomever that might be and

506
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:56,200
the voters get to decide that now I'll

507
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:58,509
still be in office to early January so

508
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:00,370
I'm looking to see more carriers get

509
00:17:58,509 --> 00:18:02,410
into the market before I leave in early

510
00:18:00,369 --> 00:18:05,829
January but I've done everything I can

511
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:07,930
to make this a core part of the

512
00:18:05,829 --> 00:18:10,210
regulatory approach of the California

513
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:12,549
Department of Insurance so that it won't

514
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:14,590
be subject to the political winds or

515
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:16,419
vagaries it's too important to

516
00:18:14,589 --> 00:18:17,829
politicize it it's too important for

517
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:19,360
California it's too important for

518
00:18:17,829 --> 00:18:21,480
consumers it's too important for the

519
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:24,369
industry and so I'm confident that

520
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:25,900
regardless of who that successor is this

521
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:26,799
will continue to be a big part of the

522
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:31,070
Department of Insurance

523
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:32,059
