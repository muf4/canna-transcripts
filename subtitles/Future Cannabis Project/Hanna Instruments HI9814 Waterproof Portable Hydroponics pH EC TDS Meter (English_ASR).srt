2
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:14,370
this is actually quite a handy unit

3
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:16,320
because you have all the measurements

4
00:00:14,369 --> 00:00:18,689
that you might want in there if you're

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:25,230
used to parts per million it has that if

6
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:29,368
you use two EC it has that and a pH and

7
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:33,390
a very relatively easy one to figure out

8
00:00:29,368 --> 00:00:36,409
how to work it quickly jumps from one

9
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:40,739
reading to another if you want to check

10
00:00:36,409 --> 00:00:42,779
out it's nice that the probe is

11
00:00:40,738 --> 00:00:44,849
replaceable all by itself rather than

12
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:47,189
having to get a whole unit you can just

13
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:50,070
if the probe goes wrong you can just

14
00:00:47,189 --> 00:00:54,718
disconnect it and I'm sure by one of

15
00:00:50,070 --> 00:01:04,549
those friends all by itself so we're

16
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:04,549
calibrating the EC meter put the sensor

17
00:01:07,099 --> 00:01:15,269
so what's that packet what's a quick

18
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:18,150
calibration unit of liquid for EC and pH

19
00:01:15,269 --> 00:01:20,429
so you're doing one step so that's gonna

20
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:23,040
calibrate both yeah okay we're normally

21
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:27,750
with with pH you would use a two step

22
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:29,670
like a seven and a four just it's a bit

23
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:32,150
more accurate like I said this is a

24
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:32,150
quick set

25
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:55,930
the EC should 5/5 at 77 degrees all

26
00:01:49,780 --> 00:02:01,030
right anyone at 86 it should be 543 hold

27
00:01:55,930 --> 00:02:02,620
it there but should the ash should be

28
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:08,640
that's be somewhere right about halfway

29
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:11,289
between so the 5200 or 5.2 we're good

30
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:25,389
okay we're Calgary I'm the EC and the pH

31
00:02:11,289 --> 00:02:36,519
yep let's go through this device so

32
00:02:25,389 --> 00:02:39,269
basically this line reads pH EC and then

33
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:43,480
what's TDs yeah total dissolved solids

34
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:46,030
which is again another another reading

35
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:48,759
and in total dissolved solids is

36
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:50,620
actually a bit different than EC and

37
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:53,530
I've never used it and I'm not that

38
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:55,780
familiar exactly what it means but it

39
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:59,259
will read some of the particles in there

40
00:02:55,780 --> 00:03:02,650
that are not being read by a salt meter

41
00:02:59,259 --> 00:03:05,289
or EC right at the moment I'm reading

42
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:10,209
our parts per million in our feed which

43
00:03:05,289 --> 00:03:13,120
is at it's on the 700 scale and it's one

44
00:03:10,209 --> 00:03:16,659
point or one twelve hundred and ten so

45
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,620
it a little bit on the probably the

46
00:03:16,659 --> 00:03:21,219
lower end right now

47
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:24,580
and if I want to change to a pH I just

48
00:03:21,219 --> 00:03:29,949
press the set hold button and it changes

49
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:33,370
to pH and our pH right now is six point

50
00:03:29,949 --> 00:03:35,619
four seven we have not yet added the pH

51
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:39,069
down so it will we will be bringing the

52
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:41,920
pH down to right around six a bit below

53
00:03:39,069 --> 00:03:43,900
six if we want to change that we were

54
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:50,649
reading in parts per million if we want

55
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:55,900
to change to EC so we are reading parts

56
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:58,930
per million on the 700 scale and we go

57
00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:03,330
twelve hundred and ten so if we want to

58
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:11,050
go to the ec scale we will push the

59
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:14,410
on/off button go past off past calibrate

60
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:18,520
onto units when we get to there we can

61
00:04:14,409 --> 00:04:20,620
see the units where in which is 700 and

62
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:24,009
we want to change that to EC we just

63
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:27,220
push the set hold button and it goes to

64
00:04:24,009 --> 00:04:29,709
EC if we push it again it goes to 500

65
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:35,560
wherever you want to go to you just stop

66
00:04:29,709 --> 00:04:39,729
at so we're gonna go back to EC and from

67
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:42,970
there we just press again and come press

68
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:47,379
the on/off mode button until we come to

69
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:52,030
where it's reading EC EC and it's one

70
00:04:47,379 --> 00:04:55,360
point seven so if you took 700 times one

71
00:04:52,029 --> 00:04:57,399
point seven you would get the 1200 parts

72
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:01,000
per million that we did with the 700

73
00:04:57,399 --> 00:05:03,729
scale if you're on a 700 scale it's you

74
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,829
C times or the EC reading times 700 gets

75
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:07,990
you to the MPM have you're on the 500

76
00:05:05,829 --> 00:05:11,819
scale that you see reading times the ppl

77
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:15,340
times 500 gives you the ppm yes okay

78
00:05:11,819 --> 00:05:17,170
it's all but you're used to looking at

79
00:05:15,339 --> 00:05:19,389
something in relation to what you've

80
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:21,360
been doing and so it's what you're

81
00:05:19,389 --> 00:05:24,639
familiar with you understand what

82
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:27,490
parts-per-million means to you with the

83
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:29,500
meter you have for me

84
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:31,960
parts per million don't doesn't mean

85
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:34,240
anything cause I'm so used to using EC

86
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:37,089
so when somebody tells me it's call it's

87
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,579
1,400 parts per million I don't I don't

88
00:05:37,089 --> 00:05:42,429
know anything until okay I'll convert it

89
00:05:39,579 --> 00:05:45,129
to EC and it says - okay then then it

90
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:47,709
means something to me in all these modes

91
00:05:45,129 --> 00:05:50,290
or the readings are temperature

92
00:05:47,709 --> 00:05:52,479
sensitive so right below each of them

93
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:56,620
you will find a number it says 69

94
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:58,840
degrees right now and with salts if your

95
00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:02,220
temperature is higher the salts level is

96
00:05:58,839 --> 00:06:05,389
going to read higher so it's temperature

97
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:07,640
compensated pH is the same way

98
00:06:05,389 --> 00:06:10,550
that because higher temperatures are

99
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:12,469
better at conducting electricity or what

100
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:17,090
what's going on yeah things are more

101
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:19,400
more reactive there yeah yes essentially

102
00:06:17,089 --> 00:06:21,769
I mean if you're reading EC and it's

103
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:24,859
higher it means it's more more

104
00:06:21,769 --> 00:06:27,349
conductive at that when you're taking

105
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:29,420
care of your pH meter make sure that

106
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:31,730
you're using the cup to store the

107
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:35,600
probiem you should have a storage

108
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:38,030
solution in the pub and the cup keep it

109
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:45,800
in there keep the bulb there's a bulb on

110
00:06:38,029 --> 00:06:50,269
the bottom that reads the pH it has a

111
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:52,699
solution in there that is it's in a

112
00:06:50,269 --> 00:06:55,039
porous glass and the glass can come out

113
00:06:52,699 --> 00:06:58,129
or the solution can come out and if you

114
00:06:55,040 --> 00:07:01,850
keep it in a solution that is has a

115
00:06:58,129 --> 00:07:04,189
slight salt content in it it will help

116
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:08,180
your probe to last much longer and

117
00:07:04,189 --> 00:07:13,250
that's what the storage solution is a

118
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:15,019
probe will in general last a year when

119
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:17,300
it gets to be more than a year you may

120
00:07:15,019 --> 00:07:19,669
be able to keep it longer year and a

121
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:23,660
half if you're really diligent with with

122
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:26,090
the storage solution as soon as you are

123
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:30,590
noticing it's more erratic or it's

124
00:07:26,089 --> 00:07:33,500
difficult to get it to calibrate then

125
00:07:30,589 --> 00:07:36,379
it's time to buy a new probe if you get

126
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:39,589
a pH or EC reading that you think is

127
00:07:36,379 --> 00:07:41,779
outside of the range where you believe

128
00:07:39,589 --> 00:07:43,569
it should be don't assume there's

129
00:07:41,779 --> 00:07:45,769
something wrong first thing you do is

130
00:07:43,569 --> 00:07:47,689
recalibrate your instrument so many

131
00:07:45,769 --> 00:07:49,250
different times something can have

132
00:07:47,689 --> 00:07:52,279
happened to the instrument where the

133
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:54,399
calibration is off if you recalibrate it

134
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:58,069
and then still get the reading that

135
00:07:54,399 --> 00:08:00,829
wrong then you start to look to see what

136
00:07:58,069 --> 00:08:04,569
could have caused the change in your EC

137
00:08:00,829 --> 00:08:04,569
or pH that your seen

138
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:14,290
