1
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:14,669
my name is Kenny Morris and i started

2
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:19,890
the Venice cookie company in 2008 I came

3
00:00:14,669 --> 00:00:21,449
from I was operating a retail store a

4
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:24,390
couple different retail stores called

5
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:25,919
the pharmacy and these are retail stores

6
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:29,699
for cannabis there are dispensaries

7
00:00:25,919 --> 00:00:31,320
they're collectives and just notice that

8
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:33,000
you know one of the main things that

9
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,670
attracted people when they came in the

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,700
store was first of all a wow I can buy

11
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:40,289
cannabis in a store now and be look at

12
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,960
all the other products it's in beside

13
00:00:40,289 --> 00:00:45,629
just raw flour right people could always

14
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:50,490
go to their dealer and find cannabis

15
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:53,270
flowers but um the new novelty and the

16
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:58,020
thing that really captured people's

17
00:00:53,270 --> 00:01:00,390
attention was all of the peripheral

18
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:02,190
products all the infused products that

19
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:04,260
were now available so it just became

20
00:01:02,189 --> 00:01:08,250
real clear that that was going to be the

21
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:10,950
growth area we used the the pharmacy as

22
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:13,769
our incubator account to kind of do some

23
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:17,780
basic market testing see what works what

24
00:01:13,769 --> 00:01:20,759
didn't work and we used a couple other

25
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:23,820
we used a couple other store fronts as

26
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:27,870
well we started out as the Venice Cookie

27
00:01:23,819 --> 00:01:30,209
Company so we started out with three

28
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:32,579
products that were three cookies and we

29
00:01:30,209 --> 00:01:35,099
haven't really looked back and made a

30
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:38,569
cookie ever since we've grown more into

31
00:01:35,099 --> 00:01:43,469
a beverage and a chocolate company but

32
00:01:38,569 --> 00:01:45,539
we yeah we started with a vegan cookie a

33
00:01:43,469 --> 00:01:47,250
normal product called a cookie brownie

34
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:49,320
which was essentially a Toll House

35
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:52,170
cookie recipe with white chocolate chips

36
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:54,689
and butterscotch chips and then we made

37
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:58,228
a piece crispy treat which was just a

38
00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:59,939
rice krispie treat and I guess the way

39
00:01:58,228 --> 00:02:01,109
the products have evolved over time is

40
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:04,170
for one thing they've gotten a lot

41
00:02:01,109 --> 00:02:06,030
smaller in 2008 it was still a real big

42
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:09,989
deal to go into a store and buy a

43
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:11,729
cannabis activated food product right so

44
00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:13,289
they happen to be they tended to be

45
00:02:11,729 --> 00:02:18,318
really large

46
00:02:13,289 --> 00:02:21,658
sold in a clamshell container you know

47
00:02:18,318 --> 00:02:23,548
huge full of calories look at me look at

48
00:02:21,658 --> 00:02:26,429
what I have look what I found I got this

49
00:02:23,549 --> 00:02:30,000
at the store so as the novelty's worn

50
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:33,239
off over the years and people rely on

51
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,620
these products to take them everyday for

52
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:38,579
some sort of medicinal or wellness

53
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:40,590
effect you know as the thrill wore off

54
00:02:38,579 --> 00:02:42,260
as the novelty wore off they just want

55
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:45,329
the product to be smaller more compact

56
00:02:42,259 --> 00:02:47,848
may be more discreet you know less

57
00:02:45,329 --> 00:02:50,760
calories easier to consume less of a

58
00:02:47,848 --> 00:02:53,608
chore to to you know take into your body

59
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:56,848
every day we source the raw material we

60
00:02:53,609 --> 00:03:01,799
extract it we test the extract we test

61
00:02:56,848 --> 00:03:05,759
the oil we put it into the food products

62
00:03:01,799 --> 00:03:07,799
and we test the products so that's the

63
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:10,469
process we're originally doing an

64
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:13,019
ethanol extraction we're using alcohol

65
00:03:10,469 --> 00:03:15,509
and a heating process to make what's

66
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:19,919
generally known as rick simpson oil

67
00:03:15,509 --> 00:03:22,798
we're using that for our extraction the

68
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:25,650
problem with using alcohol as a solvent

69
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:27,209
is it pulls chlorophyll as well so we

70
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:29,549
were and we were getting an oil that was

71
00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:31,530
black it's kind of like green food

72
00:03:29,549 --> 00:03:34,829
coloring in a little tiny vial it looks

73
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:36,810
black but it's really green and the

74
00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:38,879
bitterness that you get from chlorophyll

75
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:41,549
just in parts a little bit of an extra

76
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:45,030
taste we're trying to get rid of so we

77
00:03:41,549 --> 00:03:46,500
moved on to co2 and other extractions we

78
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:49,109
sell and distribute the products all

79
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:51,329
over the state of California from the

80
00:03:49,109 --> 00:03:52,859
you know right up against the Mexican

81
00:03:51,329 --> 00:03:54,930
border all the way right up against the

82
00:03:52,859 --> 00:03:56,849
Oregon border and you rely on

83
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:58,290
distributors or do you do you have

84
00:03:56,848 --> 00:04:00,658
direct relationships with all the

85
00:03:58,289 --> 00:04:02,759
dispensaries or we use our sales team

86
00:04:00,658 --> 00:04:04,978
okay so you have an internal sales team

87
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:08,340
correct we've been taking on for at

88
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:12,120
least a couple years now practically a

89
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:13,829
new employee or two every month so the

90
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,769
growth of the company and the expansion

91
00:04:13,829 --> 00:04:18,840
of the company's been pretty profound

92
00:04:15,769 --> 00:04:21,649
pretty significant yeah and there's not

93
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:21,649
much of an end in sight
