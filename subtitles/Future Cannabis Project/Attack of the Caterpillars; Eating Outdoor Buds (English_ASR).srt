00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:04,000
right

30
00:01:02,558 --> 00:01:06,158
and then his buddies hanging out over

31
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
there where's the other one

32
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:13,040
or of the many right here

33
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,560
oh wow that one's huge

34
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:19,759
tom that one is a fat caterpillar that's

35
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,560
that's gorging itself and then the other

36
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,840
clear

37
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:27,040
sign they're turds everywhere

38
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:30,079
um let's look around and you'll see them

39
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,759
there um

40
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:33,519
as they feed they just put their drops

41
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,159
oh yeah there's a little black uh

42
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:37,438
yeah yeah pretty much um you can see

43
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,960
them on many of the buds

44
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:40,959
so what is this that we're looking at

45
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:42,879
what are the what are these uh

46
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:44,078
we're just looking at some caterpillar

47
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:47,359
signs and symptoms

48
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:49,279
okay um here's some more

49
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:50,560
very likely that would be chewing damage

50
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:54,799
yeah um

51
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:58,159
but you can see it basically where we

52
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,920
where we see our our foe

53
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,280
over here where is this guy where'd he

54
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,280
go where did he go

55
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,200
um i thought he was up here he's been

56
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,680
roaming around here he's been laying his

57
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,920
turrets

58
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,520
right here right here and he's been

59
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,439
chewing everything here you see all that

60
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,120
chewing damage

61
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:16,079
does it take just one to do all this

62
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:19,599
damage you i've i've seen two in a bud

63
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,959
yeah but um when you see this damage

64
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:22,719
it's not long before you find them if

65
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,239
you just start looking for them

66
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:26,000
and so you go you look for this here

67
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,840
looks like chewing damage and then you

68
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,560
look for their turds right

69
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:33,920
we already saw what those look like um

70
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,920
you see that they're not far

71
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,680
there's a great picture of a of a

72
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,318
caterpillar

73
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,920
feces right there we're right where

74
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:45,359
exactly that leaf right there really

75
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:48,639
that's what that is

76
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:51,840
let me get this huge guy where's the

77
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:51,839
huge one

78
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:57,519
here's some more feces

79
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:01,439
there looks like it

80
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,959
look at that this guy has his head

81
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:10,000
buried into the uh

82
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:13,280
right into the middle of the of the bud

83
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,280
here's something to shoot at

84
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:17,679
which one their feces isn't always dark

85
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,560
brown dark brown there's some lighter

86
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,400
colors too

87
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,158
okay so let me take a picture and then

88
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,840
dark down here too you see that

89
00:03:22,158 --> 00:03:25,598
all this you see these all that right

90
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,158
there all the dark stuff doesn't all

91
00:03:25,598 --> 00:03:28,238
have to be

92
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:29,359
dark brown ah they're sometimes almost

93
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:33,840
orange or even

94
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,840
yellow yellowish brown

95
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:43,359
some fresh poo as valen as my daughter

96
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,560
tells me

97
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,319
yeah chewing damage poop

98
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,920
look around and you'll find them and

99
00:03:48,318 --> 00:03:53,359
it's it's important uh

100
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:55,598
as soon as you see them um oh look here

101
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,519
look here here's what i meant

102
00:03:55,598 --> 00:04:00,479
that's two different colors oh look at

103
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:02,239
the broad colors right there

104
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:03,919
okay so let me take a picture of that

105
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,239
and they're dried they look like yeah

106
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:07,598
so that dries it can range it can range

107
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,480
anywhere between those

108
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:10,479
those colors there

109
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:14,560
here's a bunch more right here it's

110
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:17,519
actually looks like pellets

111
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,519
wow yeah

112
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,079
easiest way they were i saw them but i

113
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,319
didn't know what they were yeah i mean

114
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,519
the easiest way to distinguish

115
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:27,759
i don't know if you can see that here

116
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:30,959
come over here easiest way to

117
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:33,280
distinguish between slugs or snails

118
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:35,279
and caterpillars because they do a lot

119
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:37,359
of similar chewing

120
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:39,679
oh so the feces is the species is

121
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,919
caterpillar and slime trails is

122
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,720
slugs and snails can you see that

123
00:04:41,918 --> 00:04:44,000
perfect

124
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,000
that's awesome i hope i can get that

125
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,199
from you yeah

126
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,040
okay so so is that pretty much the main

127
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,600
problem we have going on here i mean do

128
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,439
you see other

129
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,120
um well actually these are this is all

130
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:58,879
poop everywhere right yeah yeah

131
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:01,199
it's a it looks like bud rot right yeah

132
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:02,800
did you one question asked is what was

133
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:06,400
the weather like before you

134
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:08,000
left was it overcast and kind of muggy

135
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:10,719
or

136
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,279
not particularly it was uh you know out

137
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,080
here it

138
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:15,279
hit that the 117 it was super hot a

139
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:18,159
couple of weeks ago

140
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:20,159
super hot yeah yeah and uh just a few

141
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,680
miles from here it hit the 121 in

142
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:25,199
woodland hills

143
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:27,280
yeah we did have you know and yesterday

144
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:30,080
it was 10

145
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:30,799
5. one of you know so it's been triple

146
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:33,599
digits and

147
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:36,400
but that was extreme heat and uh shortly

148
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,400
before i left

149
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:41,360
the praying mantis have been slacking

150
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,560
diamond i assumed they they would show

151
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,000
on the caterpillars

152
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,759
they would yeah if they're big enough

153
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,439
because i've been so i mean i

154
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,919
tell you i did get a little complacent

155
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:51,360
because i had like two praying mantises

156
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:53,038
in here they were all over so it's

157
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,720
interesting because when we were here

158
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:57,120
uh two weeks ago i saw a caterpillar and

159
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,280
i

160
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,199
took it off i found one the other day i

161
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:01,918
took it off but i didn't i obviously

162
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,478
missed

163
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:05,758
so so some of some of this could come

164
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:06,079
around this side because the camera's

165
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,639
right

166
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:10,159
there so some of this could be partly

167
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:13,840
because of the caterpillar

168
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:19,120
right so bud rot

169
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:22,399
or gray mold is botrytis scenario

170
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,439
it's a fungus that affects all kinds of

171
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:26,239
different plants

172
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:27,600
um strawberries and grapes being other

173
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:31,120
big crops that

174
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:34,319
it's actually a big problem um

175
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:37,680
and usually it's something that

176
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:39,759
appears or shows itself

177
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,280
once you've got ripe fruit or in this

178
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:45,439
case ripe flowers right

179
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:48,799
um they have you know been growing and

180
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:52,160
their sugar content's high and

181
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:56,720
that's exactly what botrytis can grow on

182
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:58,639
but but it's a it's a disease and that's

183
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,319
that's not all well i was getting that

184
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:03,759
the caterpillars will wound

185
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,080
the tissue and spores find it easier to

186
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,919
get

187
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:10,639
into the plant tissue and and germinate

188
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:11,359
right right so that's a very common

189
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,000
cause of

190
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,879
of bud rot so they're almost symbiotic

191
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,720
in a bad way

192
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:18,959
yes i've been creating the environment

193
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,120
for the for the yeah

194
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:22,560
yeah so you're seeing bud rot and

195
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,240
caterpillar damage you're seeing

196
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,079
i'm saying yeah well i mean it's tough

197
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,918
to see the caterpillar damage

198
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:29,519
on the buds themselves because it's just

199
00:07:27,918 --> 00:07:31,038
a hole you can't really see

200
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:33,198
you can pull that guy out and you can

201
00:07:31,038 --> 00:07:34,079
see that you'll see the hole get rid of

202
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,639
this big one

203
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:38,079
no let me uh do you have a knife or

204
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:41,199
something to

205
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:41,199
what about that uh

206
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:47,360
here hold this yeah tom goes into his

207
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:52,318
tool kit

208
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,319
well what about the scissors sure yeah

209
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:57,680
yeah i want to show you something i see

210
00:07:55,918 --> 00:07:59,519
here

211
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,959
i don't know if uh i don't know if i

212
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:03,758
could go back in time here

213
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:06,560
but tom did you cut a piece of these

214
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:10,479
flowers off right here

215
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:12,399
it looks like you uh uh yes

216
00:08:10,478 --> 00:08:14,399
is that where you first saw it uh

217
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:15,758
probably or on this planet

218
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:18,399
look through the viewfinder when you're

219
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,400
talking yeah

220
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,840
that was the one thing i noticed from

221
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:23,680
the steve cantwell videos that i'm i'm

222
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:25,758
steve you wonder

223
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,959
no i'm saying but you're you're probably

224
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:28,960
went off a little bit

225
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:30,719
you're like you're like holding it over

226
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:33,360
here or talking oh yeah

227
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,080
um yeah all right so here so you found

228
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,479
two

229
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:39,120
two specks of it here right yes and then

230
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,959
you came in with a

231
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,399
brown and it knife right off it pulled

232
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:45,039
right off yeah so

233
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,679
yeah but it was already infected right

234
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:48,159
so

235
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:50,399
some people are of the mind cut it if

236
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:53,519
i'm close to harvest and i can keep

237
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:55,839
what's below some are the mind

238
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,440
you know cut it down low eliminate

239
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,320
another source of the spores especially

240
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,240
if you're early

241
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,320
right like you are now you know so or

242
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,480
what you were right

243
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:07,120
i tried early on but i realized i mean

244
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,399
it happened so fast within literally a

245
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,399
day through the view

246
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,440
i know within a day of the viewfinder

247
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,120
that damn

248
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,120
that it was out of my out of control

249
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,159
yeah i i didn't know what to do because

250
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,480
oh it's it's quick

251
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:20,240
yeah it's quick i've seen yeah it's like

252
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,759
with any disease i mean um

253
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,600
you guys guys my question is for

254
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:26,240
something this is obviously not a large

255
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:30,560
grow if you do see it what do you do

256
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:32,720
uh so what do you do when you see it

257
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:34,958
basically i can do is what we call

258
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,759
roguing you know you remove

259
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:40,319
tissue that's about what you can do if

260
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:42,958
you find a caterpillar in here

261
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,959
you're going to look down below you see

262
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:46,479
all these turds that drop down

263
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:48,159
on all these buds below could have been

264
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,680
he was just feeding up here looks like

265
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:52,240
he was feeding up here

266
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:54,799
but all these all that feces that

267
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,799
dropped onto these very right flowers

268
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:58,479
and then given the right conditions

269
00:09:56,799 --> 00:10:00,479
those contain spores too

270
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,680
i mean if he had been feeding on them at

271
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,440
that not just that

272
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:05,120
you know they begin to decompose the

273
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,800
tissue around where they land it also

274
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,078
begins to decompose it's usually that

275
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:11,199
combination of like

276
00:10:08,078 --> 00:10:14,159
something wet and the caterpillar feces

277
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,278
and then it it blows up so get rid of

278
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:18,399
that cola

279
00:10:15,278 --> 00:10:21,200
and if that's where it started and do a

280
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:22,000
major so can we do this so looking

281
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,920
because

282
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,278
obviously those are much worse these

283
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:28,000
have um

284
00:10:25,278 --> 00:10:30,480
sort of been trying yeah to maintain

285
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,159
themselves so

286
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:37,360
are these too far gone honestly um yeah

287
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:39,360
you can still save this for extract

288
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,480
um there's you know you'll get some

289
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,839
extract there

290
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:46,079
but uh but get in there every

291
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,360
hour that passes stand right there every

292
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:49,599
hour that passes is

293
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,440
lower yield right right because you're

294
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,079
not gonna get much out of these dried up

295
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,360
uh

296
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:57,439
you know sections yeah pieces of flour

297
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,120
so basically if you start noticing it's

298
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,360
almost like you want to chop early to

299
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,919
save what you have it may not be perfect

300
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,560
but

301
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:05,278
yeah yeah i mean if you could afford to

302
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:08,879
you could

303
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:12,159
um like what we would do where i

304
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:14,639
where i managed ipm is

305
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:16,319
you know it was kind of susceptible

306
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:18,639
strains were susceptible to this

307
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,760
this fungus so you start seeing it

308
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:22,319
blowing up on

309
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:23,360
um a particular particularly sensitive

310
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,959
strain

311
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,879
um you would uh see i'm gonna take a

312
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:29,199
picture you might harvest that early for

313
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:31,519
you know for fresh frozen so say you

314
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,920
haven't seen any of the bud rot um but

315
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:36,799
you've seen a couple of the caterpillars

316
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:37,120
um what is there pest management we can

317
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:40,078
do

318
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,759
to to sort of uh keep these caterpillars

319
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:44,479
oh yeah yeah there's there are lots of

320
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:46,319
strategies

321
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,399
the caterpillar at this stage that we

322
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,720
saw there there's not much else other

323
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:51,839
than

324
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,399
picking them off because the materials

325
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,360
that

326
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:56,000
you might use at that advanced stage

327
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,120
aren't allowed

328
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,078
in california cannabis right which are

329
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,399
what

330
00:12:00,078 --> 00:12:04,719
um just substances they're natural

331
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:07,679
substances called spinosads

332
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,320
um a number of products have them it's a

333
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:11,439
stomach

334
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:14,639
neurotoxin for uh for insects

335
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:17,519
the insect chews on plant

336
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:18,399
material that's been sprayed with it and

337
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:21,360
it it

338
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:23,278
basically poisons itself right so that's

339
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,200
something you'd want to do during veg

340
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:26,559
when it's yeah yeah i mean you would you

341
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:30,079
can't though it's not

342
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:33,119
it's not totally illegal so um

343
00:12:30,078 --> 00:12:34,879
the other you know this is

344
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,720
this could be done this could be done

345
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:37,439
when it's just starting let's put it

346
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,320
that way

347
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,519
and if and if you see big caterpillars

348
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,360
you're not going to get them with the

349
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,519
other strategies the only spray strategy

350
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,680
you might have with a big caterpillar

351
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,959
is to spray spinosads which we can't and

352
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:51,039
that's kind of a question that tom was

353
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:52,159
asking is what can we do at this stage

354
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:54,159
when you found it

355
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:56,240
um what about if you first see a

356
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:58,078
caterpillar yeah

357
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,519
that's your that's where the answer lies

358
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:02,958
okay okay is

359
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:05,600
um if any of you heard the other

360
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:06,879
uh video or streaming that we stream

361
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,480
that we did

362
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:10,480
you probably you probably recognize that

363
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:14,399
i'm big on monitoring right

364
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:17,519
so you need to know what caterpillars

365
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,320
and their adults look like and when

366
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,560
they're present

367
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,639
as soon as possible so that usually

368
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:24,958
comes in

369
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:26,959
in in catching the flying adults right

370
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:29,759
so males and females

371
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:30,479
will meet up with each other they'll fly

372
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:32,159
male will

373
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,000
you know mate with the female female

374
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:36,000
will go off and lay eggs

375
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,919
right so if you're so good about

376
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,879
monitoring for moths

377
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:42,958
right you catch that before all that

378
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:45,360
exchange has gone on right right

379
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:47,278
so and then what like you you might so

380
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:50,079
you see them how do you prevent those

381
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:51,120
them from laying their eggs out so you

382
00:13:50,078 --> 00:13:53,519
you trap

383
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,679
right um there's very little you can you

384
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:57,519
can do to like reduce their numbers

385
00:13:55,679 --> 00:14:00,000
um but it's really important at that

386
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:02,480
point to identify the species that

387
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,320
you've got right and it's hard to do it

388
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:07,039
from looking at the mobs

389
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,680
all right so for instance that one is uh

390
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:08,958
do you see it

391
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:10,879
that one looks like it's like the

392
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:12,879
cornier worm right

393
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:16,320
so would this be like the white moss

394
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:18,240
that i see flying around everywhere is

395
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,639
i think it is a white moth i'm really

396
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,320
bad at uh moths and butterflies

397
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:23,919
but um yeah i think it is it's like it's

398
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,519
not like a monarch butterfly

399
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:27,039
oh no wait it isn't it's a bra i'm sorry

400
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:29,440
it's helicoverpa

401
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:31,439
zaya and i think it's a brown one let me

402
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:34,639
uh so i have a question like

403
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,920
looking up here at at all of these up

404
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:40,000
here

405
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:42,559
um did were the caterpillars hitting

406
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,159
each one of these or is there is there a

407
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:46,799
disease i don't think so

408
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:48,159
i don't think so if this is you know

409
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:51,919
botrytis it does look

410
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:53,039
very dried up and then yeah usually it's

411
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:55,120
you know there's something going on

412
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:57,278
within the plant usually yeah the

413
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,759
botrytis has actually entered the plant

414
00:14:57,278 --> 00:15:00,799
not not the whole plant but the tissue

415
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:04,240
that's affected

416
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:05,838
now maybe um the botrytis flared up on

417
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:09,519
you because of some

418
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:10,959
some climate event like some humidity or

419
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:12,480
something that happened but then after

420
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:14,719
the heat this is

421
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,159
this could be why you got all this quick

422
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,639
browning yeah you know because the

423
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:20,159
tissue was dead already yeah um you just

424
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:22,399
probably weren't aware of

425
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:24,159
of the symptoms i mean we'd have to we

426
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:26,399
have to break some of these buds open so

427
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:28,399
that you could see what although there

428
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:32,639
is a lot of caterpillar damage so

429
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:37,360
a lot of this could have been from them

430
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:40,000
yeah so this was not just caterpillars

431
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:42,480
although geez i'm finding

432
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,919
lots of feces yeah and i didn't think

433
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,879
that one

434
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:46,879
should have had any

435
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:51,838
so basically you're seeing a one-two

436
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:54,958
punch of botrytis

437
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:58,320
and caterpillar yeah yeah um

438
00:15:54,958 --> 00:16:01,679
it's a disease that here's

439
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,680
this for you another seed

440
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:06,719
what's that a seed nice yeah so there's

441
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:08,639
a disease and then there's

442
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,320
i guess effectively what you might call

443
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:11,680
it the vector although it's not really a

444
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,720
vector it's there's

445
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:15,198
what's causing a uh a susceptibility to

446
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,199
the plant

447
00:16:15,198 --> 00:16:18,399
and then it's the the caterpillar is

448
00:16:17,198 --> 00:16:20,639
injuring it yeah

449
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:21,679
right but back to monitoring if you if

450
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:24,079
you can id

451
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:24,799
moths those are going to come in earlier

452
00:16:24,078 --> 00:16:27,599
right

453
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:28,879
so mods are hard to control there are

454
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,800
strategies but

455
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:33,198
um they're very difficult for the ones

456
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:36,479
that are normally attacking cannabis

457
00:16:33,198 --> 00:16:40,399
but that could be the trigger for

458
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:44,639
certain applications for example

459
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:50,720
the the um bti have you heard of bti

460
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:52,799
bacillus thuringiensis good idea

461
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,160
also let's uh there's these plants over

462
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:56,240
here while you're talking all right i've

463
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:58,078
got a few more yeah you see uh

464
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:04,558
you're getting it here it's just

465
00:16:58,078 --> 00:17:06,000
starting yeah

466
00:17:04,558 --> 00:17:08,240
and here you don't see the chewing

467
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,959
damage

468
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,400
might be some here but i doubt it

469
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:17,519
although i'm seeing

470
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:18,959
feces right here that looks like feces

471
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:22,078
i would say a good chunk of it is

472
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:23,679
because of that feeding i mean these

473
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:26,078
they seem to be in a lot of your buds

474
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:28,079
like right there

475
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:29,678
so there was a caterpillar here at one

476
00:17:28,078 --> 00:17:33,200
point feeding

477
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:35,038
it it's possible it's it's a primary

478
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:37,200
reason huh

479
00:17:35,038 --> 00:17:38,720
i mean i've not seen i can't find them

480
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,519
either that's the other part yeah that's

481
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,880
caterpillars

482
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:46,079
yeah yeah but yeah there's quite a bit

483
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:48,559
if you look in here

484
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:49,279
that's a clean flower right there right

485
00:17:48,558 --> 00:17:51,519
more or less

486
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:53,119
yeah but it's just been completely shat

487
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:57,200
on

488
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:59,599
um and yeah so any humidity change

489
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:01,519
any injury just the fact that you have a

490
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:04,959
little fermenting

491
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:06,000
um little compost pile of caterpillar

492
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,038
turds

493
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,359
on tissue that's already well advanced

494
00:18:09,038 --> 00:18:12,480
and

495
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:12,879
nearly ripe close to harvest you know

496
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,279
it's

497
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,480
it's setting yourself up for another

498
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:18,319
site where

499
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,919
where the fungus can blow up on you

500
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:22,960
right right

501
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:25,759
and then the spores from this plant here

502
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,558
looks like this cola pure you cut back

503
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:28,319
too right

504
00:18:26,558 --> 00:18:30,000
yeah you took it you chopped this one

505
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:32,879
off too

506
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,679
when you first saw it yeah yeah so he

507
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,880
started up

508
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:38,720
it started up here can send it that way

509
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,480
you have more injuries or really soft

510
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,120
tissue and then you get the

511
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:45,360
right weather conditions and now you've

512
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:48,798
spread it that way

513
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:51,918
it sounds like once it's it's spreading

514
00:18:48,798 --> 00:18:55,440
it's kind of hard to uh yeah yeah

515
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:57,600
yeah very difficult um there's really um

516
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,720
i mean this one looks actually well now

517
00:18:57,599 --> 00:19:00,959
there's the bud rot yeah

518
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:03,200
yeah top cola and what's interesting

519
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:06,240
what we've been finding a lot of is

520
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:08,798
almost every diseased even the the

521
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,160
kind of the less diseased buds are

522
00:19:08,798 --> 00:19:13,599
covered in caterpillar

523
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:16,798
if you see so i at this point i

524
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:20,000
i might say it's the main reason i mean

525
00:19:16,798 --> 00:19:22,079
it's any flower that's got any

526
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,558
meaning the caterpillar just overwhelmed

527
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:26,399
it and then the detroit the

528
00:19:24,558 --> 00:19:29,200
we only found those two but that was a

529
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,798
quick glance and um

530
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,319
yeah it's uh that's what i'm saying i

531
00:19:30,798 --> 00:19:34,079
mean i've been out here every day

532
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:37,359
looking for caterpillars

533
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:37,359
to find them you saw they're green

534
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:41,759
it's like a grow where you only have a

535
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:43,038
couple plants they're not like all

536
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:46,319
bunched up it's not

537
00:19:43,038 --> 00:19:47,759
hot and humid and no air circulation

538
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:50,000
you know there's there's there's also

539
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:52,240
strain susceptibility so

540
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,919
are you are you aware with the disease

541
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,000
of the disease triangle i've heard of

542
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:58,320
that before it's this concept that was

543
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,119
developed

544
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:02,319
related to disease um implants but it's

545
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:05,519
the same for humans

546
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:08,079
um disease disease triangle consists of

547
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:10,639
it's a way to explain how disease

548
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:13,839
happens how it proceeds and how it can

549
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:15,520
damage you economically right there's

550
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:17,199
three components to it the first

551
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:20,319
component is the presence

552
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,440
of whatever pathogen so

553
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:24,079
come out of the heat come out of this

554
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:25,038
good idea whatever pathogen we're

555
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:26,639
talking about right

556
00:20:25,038 --> 00:20:28,240
in this case it would be actually

557
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:32,960
botrytis scenario

558
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:34,319
right um spores could be the presence

559
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:38,159
but there's also what are called

560
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:40,399
sclerosia and that's it's uh

561
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:42,720
near the end of the season it goes into

562
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:45,280
a sort of like a hibernation type

563
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:47,679
you know suspended animation uh

564
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:50,079
basically it's a survival structure

565
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:50,960
and then that structure can stay in the

566
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:54,079
area

567
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:55,200
and once again germinate in the right

568
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:57,839
conditions

569
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,640
when there's on in the next crop you

570
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:01,519
know what i mean

571
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,000
it can survive on plant debris it can

572
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:04,639
survive

573
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,240
on rich soil i mean it can survive in

574
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:09,280
rich soil

575
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,159
so it's just waiting there to germinate

576
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:13,759
again so

577
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:17,200
the presence is is uh one of those

578
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:19,839
components of the disease triangle

579
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,798
obviously then there's the susceptible

580
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:24,480
host

581
00:21:20,798 --> 00:21:26,079
right so that's where i was getting here

582
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,679
this is obviously a susceptible host

583
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:29,199
it's a problem in all cannabis

584
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:33,360
production

585
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:36,960
grape grapes also it's a problem in many

586
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:38,158
you know vineyards in strawberries it's

587
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:41,038
also a problem in

588
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:41,760
strawberry so we're talking about hosts

589
00:21:41,038 --> 00:21:45,440
that

590
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:48,640
will can be parasitized by the fungus

591
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:51,038
right and

592
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,320
and yeah um if we think about it we've

593
00:21:51,038 --> 00:21:55,599
got

594
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:57,759
different susceptibilities right

595
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:59,119
there's a in the vineyards for example

596
00:21:57,759 --> 00:22:02,079
there are a couple grapes that are very

597
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:05,279
thin-skinned varieties

598
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:07,119
that are much more susceptible to

599
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:08,720
the botrytis sponge they call it bunch

600
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:12,239
rod and vineyards

601
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:13,038
versus a loose uh versus a hard skin

602
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,679
grape

603
00:22:13,038 --> 00:22:16,400
right that has you know tight tight

604
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:19,440
little

605
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:21,280
berries they're less susceptible um

606
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:24,558
they're not it's not as easy for the

607
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:27,200
fungus to penetrate the tissue

608
00:22:24,558 --> 00:22:29,759
so varietal differences in grapes make

609
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:32,319
it make a difference well guess what

610
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:34,400
they also do in cannabis i don't know

611
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:37,439
what strains you have here

612
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:39,038
but if you have those susceptible

613
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,840
strains

614
00:22:39,038 --> 00:22:42,240
you you can see the difference between

615
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:43,918
you know

616
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,279
five percent and one strain let's say

617
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:47,038
and thirty percent

618
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:49,759
in another string yeah right so strain

619
00:22:47,038 --> 00:22:50,558
is big uh we still don't understand that

620
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:54,000
very well

621
00:22:50,558 --> 00:22:55,759
um mirror implore cannabis

622
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,919
growers to take notes so are there

623
00:22:55,759 --> 00:22:59,519
certain pests like you say even just for

624
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:01,120
a small home grower like this that i

625
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:03,440
might want to keep around to sort of

626
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:07,038
counteract the butterflies or the yeah

627
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:08,880
let me get to that so the last component

628
00:23:07,038 --> 00:23:12,558
of the disease triangle is actually

629
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:17,200
um the environmental conditions for

630
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:17,200
the disease to infect right

631
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:21,519
and basically the concept of this

632
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:22,959
disease triangle is

633
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:25,038
you have to have all three of those

634
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:28,319
components present

635
00:23:25,038 --> 00:23:29,119
in order to have disease or have disease

636
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:32,798
that's

637
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:36,158
economically you know problematic

638
00:23:32,798 --> 00:23:37,759
right if you can break with one if you

639
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:39,760
can control one

640
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:42,319
you can control the disease right right

641
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:42,960
so if you had if we had a cannabis

642
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:46,399
strain that

643
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:49,759
was not susceptible to um

644
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:51,919
to you know to this uh to the fungus

645
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:53,440
zero percent susceptibility and you grew

646
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:55,120
only that guess what you broke that

647
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,480
triangle there you eliminated a

648
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:59,678
susceptible host

649
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:01,440
right um another

650
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:03,038
part of susceptibility we talked about

651
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:06,880
it the chewing damage

652
00:24:03,038 --> 00:24:10,079
caused on the on the uh on the flower

653
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:12,320
being a an area where the fungus can

654
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:13,199
infect and get to the tissues easily and

655
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:15,678
quickly

656
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,319
and feed on it and sporulate and pretty

657
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:18,480
soon

658
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:20,639
destroy that bud right so if you don't

659
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:22,720
have that damage

660
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,640
then you've not you've made it less

661
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,960
susceptible whatever host it is so you

662
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:29,919
can see how you can focus on these

663
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,720
areas so the big one for botrytis

664
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:34,720
honestly is

665
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:38,079
is environment um environment is

666
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:39,440
uh by far the largest uh the most

667
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:41,519
important part of that disease

668
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,278
uh triangle so how would you evaluate

669
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:45,119
this environment that doesn't look

670
00:24:43,278 --> 00:24:46,720
too tight let's put it that way but what

671
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:49,759
i mean by that is

672
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:52,079
fungus likes humidity yeah fungus like

673
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:53,119
likes a certain range of temperature if

674
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:55,759
you

675
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:57,119
grow plants too tight uh two the

676
00:24:55,759 --> 00:24:58,720
canopies are too

677
00:24:57,119 --> 00:25:00,319
yeah you're not you won't allow for

678
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,600
airflow right

679
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:04,639
we were talking about botrytis and

680
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:05,839
grapes the two susceptible grapes that i

681
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,759
that i was talking about the

682
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:09,199
thin-skinned ones also have very very

683
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:12,079
tight bunches

684
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:13,519
right so if a spore gets in there

685
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:15,599
there's no way

686
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:16,879
to change the environment in that

687
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:19,038
cluster

688
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:21,200
to be other than just humid and dark

689
00:25:19,038 --> 00:25:23,919
right and when the grapes get sweet

690
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:25,679
now it's got food right so you've you've

691
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:28,880
got this strain that's got a tight

692
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:30,720
tight cluster formation whereas a loose

693
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:33,200
one like you see in table grapes

694
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,960
you know how you you you can see every

695
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:37,278
grape inside the cluster on

696
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,640
table grapes so not as susceptible even

697
00:25:37,278 --> 00:25:41,119
if these plants had been

698
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:43,038
uh farther apart they still the nature

699
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:43,359
of these plants was the large leaves

700
00:25:43,038 --> 00:25:46,000
they

701
00:25:43,359 --> 00:25:48,319
were growing abundantly leaving a lot of

702
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,599
shade underneath and probably still a

703
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:52,879
lot of opportunity

704
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:55,199
for uh the bugs to uh

705
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,080
be comfortable i mean i've not seen this

706
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,798
before where

707
00:25:56,079 --> 00:25:59,199
every bud seems to have some feces so a

708
00:25:58,798 --> 00:26:00,798
big

709
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,720
i think a big part of it must have been

710
00:26:00,798 --> 00:26:05,839
the caterpillars um but

711
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:06,480
but uh i mean again what strain is this

712
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:11,038
do you have

713
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:14,400
the other this is like uh um

714
00:26:11,038 --> 00:26:14,879
uh what's the high cbd strain it's it's

715
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,720
a high

716
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:22,480
cbd cross bite with an alien uh

717
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:24,319
fire um so we know each other

718
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,400
we know even less about steve but what's

719
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:27,918
interesting is these are these are two

720
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,679
different cultivars so

721
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:31,520
all these over here are one but those

722
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:33,759
are all autos that are totally different

723
00:26:31,519 --> 00:26:36,319
mm-hmm and this this one that over here

724
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:39,440
that was simply destroyed

725
00:26:36,319 --> 00:26:40,639
that was an auto now these here are

726
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:43,519
newer ones

727
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:45,278
and they haven't been quite uh affected

728
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:46,158
yet these are our younger plants this

729
00:26:45,278 --> 00:26:47,679
one however

730
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:49,600
you're not yes that's probably not going

731
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:51,600
to go very far yeah and you've already

732
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:52,399
got it there that won't go very far i

733
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:55,278
think

734
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:56,400
and i think i can see in here the

735
00:26:55,278 --> 00:26:59,679
caterpillar

736
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:01,440
never mind yeah yeah you've got quite a

737
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:03,600
bit of feces down here

738
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,558
so and you got quite a bit right there

739
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:06,639
so wow

740
00:27:04,558 --> 00:27:08,558
well how about those okay so what what

741
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:11,038
keeps the caterpillars back what's our

742
00:27:08,558 --> 00:27:12,399
yeah so okay well i wanted to i wanted

743
00:27:11,038 --> 00:27:13,919
to talk about that disease

744
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,440
triangle just because you know then

745
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:16,720
you're just where do you sit on this you

746
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,480
see the impact of the

747
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,319
of the caterpillar right it's making the

748
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:23,360
host more susceptible right

749
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:26,079
sit on the couch so obviously uh just

750
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:27,918
destroying that particular component of

751
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:31,678
the disease triangle

752
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:34,080
is uh you know is going to be helpful to

753
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:36,080
ending the disease or keeping it from

754
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:37,678
hurting you economically right

755
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:39,599
so what's the strategies well we talked

756
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:41,840
about monitoring that's the foundation

757
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:42,639
all right you want to know as early as

758
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:44,879
possible

759
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:46,320
right you have a you have an insect

760
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,159
who's going to lay eggs

761
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:50,240
they're going to hatch or we're going to

762
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:51,200
want to feed you've got some time before

763
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:54,399
that happens to

764
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:57,759
to put in some control out um action

765
00:27:54,398 --> 00:28:00,158
for for caterpillar um so

766
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:02,960
fastest the earliest sign would be when

767
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:06,320
the adults are flying into your grow

768
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:08,960
right so monitoring for the moths is

769
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:09,678
super key right it's it's very very

770
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,038
important

771
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:12,720
there's a lot of ways to monitor for the

772
00:28:11,038 --> 00:28:16,558
mods but when you see them

773
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:19,839
you can begin initiating actions

774
00:28:16,558 --> 00:28:21,278
that don't even require for the larva to

775
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:24,558
be out and about yet

776
00:28:21,278 --> 00:28:25,919
right such as um you can be

777
00:28:24,558 --> 00:28:28,240
you can start your bacillus

778
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:31,278
thuringienses i was saying bti

779
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:32,640
it's a another it's a bacteria that um

780
00:28:31,278 --> 00:28:36,159
when the caterpillar

781
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:38,559
feeds on it it grows in its stomachs

782
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:40,640
and it's stomach in the um so so would

783
00:28:38,558 --> 00:28:42,879
that be like a foliar spray or something

784
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:44,960
or spray yeah so you put it what like in

785
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,880
water and yeah it would be a

786
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,558
foliar spray right you see you see the

787
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:50,000
mic wouldn't i have used that i mean

788
00:28:48,558 --> 00:28:52,398
why wouldn't someone just use that

789
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,079
anyway as a precautionary measure well

790
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:55,359
you know there's philosophies about not

791
00:28:54,079 --> 00:28:58,079
wanting to spray for

792
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:59,119
any number of reasons right um you know

793
00:28:58,079 --> 00:29:00,720
there's there's

794
00:28:59,119 --> 00:29:02,158
there's disease and there's potential

795
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,798
for burn and then there's

796
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:06,320
there's expense you know every spray is

797
00:29:04,798 --> 00:29:07,918
labor and material

798
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:10,960
right there are a number of reasons why

799
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:12,720
not to but you make a very good point

800
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,798
this this particular bacteria is

801
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:18,000
specific to caterpillars

802
00:29:14,798 --> 00:29:20,960
it really doesn't it doesn't really hurt

803
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:23,038
any other insect or any other animal so

804
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,480
it's pretty safe for other life eaters

805
00:29:23,038 --> 00:29:25,759
like an aphid wouldn't really be

806
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,720
affected by that that's interesting no

807
00:29:25,759 --> 00:29:29,278
not at all

808
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,798
um it's it's specific it's a it's i

809
00:29:29,278 --> 00:29:32,398
guess you couldn't call it a disease

810
00:29:30,798 --> 00:29:34,558
it's it's a disease specific for

811
00:29:32,398 --> 00:29:36,798
caterpillars well for me in particular

812
00:29:34,558 --> 00:29:38,960
knowing that i really have a caterpillar

813
00:29:36,798 --> 00:29:39,599
problem back in this yard it might make

814
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,679
exist

815
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:43,038
maybe it's all the dog food and you can

816
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:45,600
decide you know yeah

817
00:29:43,038 --> 00:29:47,679
absolutely um i'm where um i've been

818
00:29:45,599 --> 00:29:49,918
working with some um

819
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:50,960
cold crop growers in salinas and right

820
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:53,440
now salinas and

821
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:54,399
other people say cold crop cold crops

822
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,630
like uh

823
00:29:54,398 --> 00:29:57,678
cabbage that kind of stuff okay

824
00:29:56,630 --> 00:30:00,320
[Music]

825
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:03,200
the salinas is going through a big

826
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:04,879
problem with diamondback moth

827
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,480
and they're using these sprays for the

828
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,080
caterpillars and some of the growers

829
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:11,038
have sprayed

830
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:11,918
geez um like a dozen times you know

831
00:30:11,038 --> 00:30:14,960
where they would have only

832
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:15,759
done three sprays in the in in previous

833
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,440
years

834
00:30:15,759 --> 00:30:18,960
and it's just this real big problem and

835
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,240
there will be years where certain

836
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,600
caterpillars are going to be more

837
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:24,399
problematic than others

838
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:25,759
but you're right if if you kept up on it

839
00:30:24,398 --> 00:30:27,759
early enough

840
00:30:25,759 --> 00:30:29,919
you can put those sprays out and what's

841
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:33,119
important to know about those sprays is

842
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:36,240
the caterpillar has to feed on them but

843
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:36,879
once the caterpillar is advanced in

844
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,679
other words

845
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:41,760
far along on its development one of the

846
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:43,519
later larval stages

847
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:45,679
they're not they're not as susceptible

848
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:47,359
anymore to it so like our friend right

849
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:49,919
here would be an example of

850
00:30:47,359 --> 00:30:50,558
he would probably yeah he would just he

851
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:53,200
would eat

852
00:30:50,558 --> 00:30:54,558
the the bti gemma can you be our

853
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:57,038
caterpillar model can you show

854
00:30:54,558 --> 00:30:58,960
can you just put your hand out thank you

855
00:30:57,038 --> 00:31:02,398
yeah he would eat the bti and then just

856
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:06,480
uh give you the finger that is

857
00:31:02,398 --> 00:31:08,479
some caterpillar okay so so all right so

858
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:10,079
earlier so there aren't like okay so

859
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,679
what else what other example what else

860
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:14,158
can you do so

861
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:15,278
so when the caterpillar's young and it

862
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:17,278
feeds on this stuff

863
00:31:15,278 --> 00:31:18,798
that's when it gets them okay so you if

864
00:31:17,278 --> 00:31:19,599
you can put that stuff out right about

865
00:31:18,798 --> 00:31:22,000
when they're hatching

866
00:31:19,599 --> 00:31:23,839
so i saw yeah we saw some pretty small

867
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,480
caterpillars about two weeks ago so that

868
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:26,398
would have

869
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:28,480
been it you could apply like four weeks

870
00:31:26,398 --> 00:31:30,079
ago we should have sprayed if you had if

871
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:32,159
you had known

872
00:31:30,079 --> 00:31:34,240
right the week before that and had

873
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:36,480
started here had some eagle eyes

874
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:38,079
on the uh well we saw them i just didn't

875
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:40,960
i would have done all of them yeah

876
00:31:38,079 --> 00:31:42,319
i didn't know time was speeding up i

877
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:45,278
mean instead of instead of

878
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:46,000
yeah that's what i'm here for all right

879
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:50,000
you were feeding

880
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:52,720
them um but yeah you know that's that's

881
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,000
strategy there's more good to it than

882
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:56,399
bad

883
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,359
the usually the formulations for that

884
00:31:56,398 --> 00:31:59,599
bacteria

885
00:31:57,359 --> 00:32:01,359
aren't really dangerous in sprays so

886
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:03,678
they're very safe sprays and you know if

887
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:05,199
you're doing it everything the right way

888
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:07,120
and you get those on early enough and

889
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,440
you can't just do it once and expect it

890
00:32:07,119 --> 00:32:09,439
to

891
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:11,759
to work you know you've got to come back

892
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:14,960
at whatever the label recommends and

893
00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:16,720
and just just know i i can't find the

894
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,319
eggs i don't know where the tiny larva

895
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,440
are they're really difficult to find

896
00:32:18,319 --> 00:32:22,079
they're green

897
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:23,360
they're smaller than most of the leaves

898
00:32:22,079 --> 00:32:23,839
so you're not gonna find them always

899
00:32:23,359 --> 00:32:26,000
they're

900
00:32:23,839 --> 00:32:27,678
they're in there they're chewing if they

901
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,278
chew on this if they just happen to chew

902
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:31,679
on a leaf that i sprayed with this

903
00:32:29,278 --> 00:32:33,278
then they're toast and control can be

904
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:36,159
achieved now before that

905
00:32:33,278 --> 00:32:37,519
that part like keeping like even trying

906
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:38,399
to do something so that you don't have

907
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:40,079
to spray

908
00:32:38,398 --> 00:32:41,839
would that be just limited to like

909
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:42,639
trapping the moths or because i'm

910
00:32:41,839 --> 00:32:45,519
outside

911
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:46,480
mass trapping for mass trapping for um

912
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:48,960
for moths

913
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:50,159
is is really that i know not a really

914
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,600
good strategy for control

915
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:54,159
because they can fly in from everywhere

916
00:32:51,599 --> 00:32:56,879
but if you want to dive in a little deep

917
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:59,278
um there are pheromones and you know

918
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:01,679
what pheromones are right they're what

919
00:32:59,278 --> 00:33:02,960
males or females emit to attract the

920
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:06,399
other sex

921
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:07,360
for mating um there are so um all moths

922
00:33:06,398 --> 00:33:09,278
this is how

923
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:11,119
females attract males through pheromones

924
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:13,440
right and they they

925
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:15,119
they could be miles away even and the

926
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:18,480
male can pick up the scent

927
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:21,518
right well for some of some moths

928
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:24,558
not many and actually none

929
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:26,000
yet that i know of that that hits the

930
00:33:24,558 --> 00:33:27,440
cannabis plant but but

931
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,359
you know we never know when one of these

932
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:31,759
mods that i'm talking about will start

933
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:31,759
hitting us

934
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:38,319
we've been uh scientists you know

935
00:33:35,278 --> 00:33:40,558
have been able to synthesize

936
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:41,839
these pheromones in the lab and then you

937
00:33:40,558 --> 00:33:43,440
can use something that's called the

938
00:33:41,839 --> 00:33:44,959
mating disruption so if you take the

939
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:47,679
synthesized pheromone

940
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:49,038
you put it in your farm you put it you

941
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:50,399
know you distribute it through your farm

942
00:33:49,038 --> 00:33:51,599
and you have this huge cloud of

943
00:33:50,398 --> 00:33:54,479
pheromone

944
00:33:51,599 --> 00:33:56,879
like a like a million or like a trillion

945
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:58,240
females are in that field

946
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,159
that would attract all the males it'll

947
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:02,399
attack track the males but the strategy

948
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:05,200
is where is she

949
00:34:02,398 --> 00:34:07,038
he's blind and there's this huge cloud

950
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:10,000
that he uses himself to guide himself

951
00:34:07,038 --> 00:34:10,719
directly to where she is oh so so if

952
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,639
there are

953
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:14,559
females you scrambled his radar

954
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:15,519
everywhere and he can't find the female

955
00:34:14,559 --> 00:34:17,599
so he can't mate

956
00:34:15,519 --> 00:34:19,199
yep that's called mating because where i

957
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:20,879
thought you were going is like you know

958
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:22,158
when i was growing up we always had

959
00:34:20,878 --> 00:34:23,918
beetle traps where you have the

960
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:25,358
pheromones too which attract them and

961
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:26,799
they go into the trap that they can't

962
00:34:25,358 --> 00:34:27,679
get out of and you have a thousand in

963
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:31,039
there the next day

964
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:32,559
there are some some pests where that

965
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:34,239
really works effectively i thought you

966
00:34:32,559 --> 00:34:36,239
were going well you'd put the

967
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:38,000
uh pheromones near a pigeon and then so

968
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:38,799
they'll start mating with pigeons and

969
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,398
you know

970
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:45,599
another interspecies yeah yeah

971
00:34:42,398 --> 00:34:48,078
anyway but yeah but

972
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:50,000
like i said as i said there's there

973
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:51,760
aren't very many

974
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,039
species where we have these pheromones

975
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:55,839
for um

976
00:34:53,039 --> 00:34:56,480
we do have a few i know um i used to

977
00:34:55,838 --> 00:35:00,480
battle

978
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:01,760
light brown apple moth in in herbs

979
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,440
and there happened to be a mating

980
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:05,839
disruption pheromone and that's exactly

981
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:09,358
one of the arms of the strategy we used

982
00:35:05,838 --> 00:35:11,039
um as as well as the the bt sprays

983
00:35:09,358 --> 00:35:12,639
well it sounds to me well let me ask

984
00:35:11,039 --> 00:35:16,239
this have you seen

985
00:35:12,639 --> 00:35:19,679
something of this decimation scale

986
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:21,679
in a in a commercial grow recently um

987
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:22,719
the odd part is is i can't find the

988
00:35:21,679 --> 00:35:24,799
caterpillars

989
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:26,000
but i can see all their feces in there

990
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,000
so they're crafting

991
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,920
it's about looking i'm sure there's more

992
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,199
i mean it took me about what two minutes

993
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,559
to find two of them right yeah

994
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:34,480
can you go find us some more

995
00:35:32,559 --> 00:35:39,039
caterpillars

996
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:39,039
look look in the fluffy flowers

997
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:43,440
yeah so again i don't think mating

998
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,358
disruption is a good strategy for

999
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,639
cannabis because we just don't have

1000
00:35:45,358 --> 00:35:48,159
you know we barely know which

1001
00:35:46,639 --> 00:35:49,598
caterpillars are gonna hurt us and the

1002
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:50,559
ones that are hitting us i don't believe

1003
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:52,640
we have

1004
00:35:50,559 --> 00:35:55,599
maiden disruption so you've got is that

1005
00:35:52,639 --> 00:35:57,598
pheromone applicable to all different

1006
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:59,039
butterflies in moss or like only one

1007
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:00,720
species specifically

1008
00:35:59,039 --> 00:36:02,880
so you know it's not even it's not even

1009
00:36:00,719 --> 00:36:04,159
family specific you know like insects

1010
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,838
have fat

1011
00:36:04,159 --> 00:36:07,440
so so you'd really need to know which

1012
00:36:05,838 --> 00:36:11,039
one is infecting your plants

1013
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:14,240
so like that was corny or worm right um

1014
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:16,400
but what's the strategy there okay well

1015
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:17,439
um that there's nothing specific for

1016
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,920
coronary worm

1017
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:20,639
um but but we'll get to the bio control

1018
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,880
also okay

1019
00:36:20,639 --> 00:36:24,319
so so the pheromone wouldn't work for

1020
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:26,880
chronic cornea worm

1021
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:28,640
but the bt toxin would work right right

1022
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,280
um what else is available then you can

1023
00:36:28,639 --> 00:36:32,879
talk about

1024
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:35,119
you know um macro you know predators

1025
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:36,960
beyond just the bacteria that's a micro

1026
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:39,440
predator right it's a parasite of the

1027
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:40,480
of the caterpillar right um there are um

1028
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:43,519
what are called

1029
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:45,440
um the parasitic wasp the uh the

1030
00:36:43,519 --> 00:36:47,440
okay trichogramma wasps yeah have you

1031
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:50,079
heard of these yeah so

1032
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:51,838
um wasps are really interesting um order

1033
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:55,280
of insects in that they're

1034
00:36:51,838 --> 00:36:58,000
very commonly parasitic their lifestyle

1035
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:59,440
is parasitic so i'm sure you've heard of

1036
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,000
the tarantula hawk

1037
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:03,838
and how it it'll inject its eggs into a

1038
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,920
tarantula and then the eggs the

1039
00:37:03,838 --> 00:37:06,960
larva will eat the tarantula from inside

1040
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:09,280
out new

1041
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:10,320
adult hatches right or emerges right

1042
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:14,320
right um

1043
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:15,599
there happen to be small teeny wasps

1044
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,599
the yeah they're actually programmable

1045
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:20,079
right the same thing with

1046
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:20,720
uh yeah except except that they inject

1047
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:23,839
their eggs

1048
00:37:20,719 --> 00:37:26,239
into the moths eggs so they'll search

1049
00:37:23,838 --> 00:37:27,440
for and find the cluster of eggs or the

1050
00:37:26,239 --> 00:37:30,000
individual eggs

1051
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:30,960
and inject their egg and then during the

1052
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,679
development

1053
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:34,639
so you want so say you were going to do

1054
00:37:33,679 --> 00:37:37,358
a wasp

1055
00:37:34,639 --> 00:37:39,440
treatment you would want to do that um

1056
00:37:37,358 --> 00:37:39,759
yes when you have the food available for

1057
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,519
them

1058
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:43,040
when you've got it's they're not eating

1059
00:37:41,519 --> 00:37:43,519
right they're not oh yeah no no yeah

1060
00:37:43,039 --> 00:37:45,279
it's not a

1061
00:37:43,519 --> 00:37:46,719
it's not food yeah yeah they're putting

1062
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,480
their eggs they're putting their eggs in

1063
00:37:46,719 --> 00:37:51,439
them yeah um

1064
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:51,838
why wait why wait okay have them have

1065
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:54,079
them there

1066
00:37:51,838 --> 00:37:55,599
so they will so if you if you bring the

1067
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:56,640
waspsmen they're not going to go away

1068
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:59,440
they're going to stick around they will

1069
00:37:56,639 --> 00:38:00,960
go away yeah so that's the thing is

1070
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:02,559
you know they will be they will search

1071
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:05,358
for caterpillar eggs and then if they

1072
00:38:02,559 --> 00:38:06,639
find a hornworm egg and it happens to be

1073
00:38:05,358 --> 00:38:09,279
one of the ones

1074
00:38:06,639 --> 00:38:10,000
that species that likes hornworm there

1075
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:12,480
in your

1076
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,440
in your tomatoes then they might just

1077
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,440
fly over there

1078
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,800
and and work on that and then eventually

1079
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:18,559
get distracted and go look

1080
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:20,320
um but that's the whole point with

1081
00:38:18,559 --> 00:38:22,799
monitoring let's say you spot

1082
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:24,720
the adult you you know how to identify

1083
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,880
the cornea worm adult right

1084
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:28,719
right that's when you start your bt

1085
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,440
sprays but you also start your wasp

1086
00:38:28,719 --> 00:38:32,879
releases

1087
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:35,440
okay so and you you guys

1088
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:36,320
breed parasitic wasps so we would bring

1089
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,000
a container

1090
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:40,240
and tom would what like just put it like

1091
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,800
at the base of the

1092
00:38:40,239 --> 00:38:44,399
there's a couple options there's um

1093
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,839
there's loose eggs

1094
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,838
that you can put and they're not eggs

1095
00:38:45,838 --> 00:38:49,440
actually they're pupa um they are the

1096
00:38:47,838 --> 00:38:52,960
eggs of another moth

1097
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:54,639
right that was that have

1098
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:56,639
have a mott development what about all

1099
00:38:54,639 --> 00:38:57,920
the feces can you tell from the feces

1100
00:38:56,639 --> 00:39:00,480
what you're dealing with

1101
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:02,480
it's hard it's really difficult um you

1102
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:04,480
mean like which caterpillar yeah i mean

1103
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:06,079
small feces might mean a small species

1104
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,559
of caterpillar but it could also be a

1105
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:08,960
larval

1106
00:39:06,559 --> 00:39:10,799
a younger larval stage of a big species

1107
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:12,880
of cattle right whatever

1108
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:14,079
but no the the way to do it and it's

1109
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:16,480
even difficult

1110
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:18,160
it's even difficult collecting um the

1111
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:20,800
you know when you collect the individual

1112
00:39:18,159 --> 00:39:21,598
um caterpillars because you know they go

1113
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,839
through numerous

1114
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:25,359
stages they mult through their life

1115
00:39:23,838 --> 00:39:27,838
stages so

1116
00:39:25,358 --> 00:39:29,679
and they don't look identical i have a

1117
00:39:27,838 --> 00:39:33,599
slide on a presentation

1118
00:39:29,679 --> 00:39:35,759
which has five different looking

1119
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:37,680
caterpillars and i ask people how many

1120
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:39,599
caterpillars do you see here they say

1121
00:39:37,679 --> 00:39:41,598
five they say no that's the same one

1122
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:44,079
it's just different larval stages

1123
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:45,039
so you you gotta kind of at some point

1124
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:46,880
you gotta

1125
00:39:45,039 --> 00:39:48,159
sometimes have to rely on an expert with

1126
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,760
the comments so yeah

1127
00:39:48,159 --> 00:39:51,358
not only do you need to monitor but you

1128
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:53,280
need to be ideal

1129
00:39:51,358 --> 00:39:54,400
and entomologists because here's the

1130
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:56,800
thing is

1131
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:59,039
those wasps there are different species

1132
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:00,880
of the shrubs and like we rear three

1133
00:39:59,039 --> 00:40:02,079
right they tend to target different

1134
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:04,400
species of moths

1135
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:06,240
so if you release the wrong one you

1136
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,720
might as well not be releasing it all no

1137
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:09,519
doubt

1138
00:40:06,719 --> 00:40:10,559
right so you got to know not just which

1139
00:40:09,519 --> 00:40:12,159
ones you have but

1140
00:40:10,559 --> 00:40:13,920
which other ones you know you may have

1141
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:16,960
more than one caterpillar

1142
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:18,880
yeah exactly okay so the challenge is a

1143
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:21,358
huge parasitic wasp

1144
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:22,240
only focuses targets one type of

1145
00:40:21,358 --> 00:40:24,159
caterpillar egg

1146
00:40:22,239 --> 00:40:25,679
no they do cross over to different

1147
00:40:24,159 --> 00:40:28,719
things it's just it's just

1148
00:40:25,679 --> 00:40:29,919
the research has shown that this

1149
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:33,199
particular wasp

1150
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:34,639
can can control this particular

1151
00:40:33,199 --> 00:40:37,358
caterpillar

1152
00:40:34,639 --> 00:40:38,559
in these crops whereas this one can't

1153
00:40:37,358 --> 00:40:41,358
even though it may

1154
00:40:38,559 --> 00:40:42,639
on occasion inject its larva maybe it's

1155
00:40:41,358 --> 00:40:44,639
not a preferred

1156
00:40:42,639 --> 00:40:46,239
choice for it or maybe just didn't

1157
00:40:44,639 --> 00:40:48,480
evolve on that

1158
00:40:46,239 --> 00:40:49,358
particular caterpillar and the egg is

1159
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:52,240
not viable

1160
00:40:49,358 --> 00:40:52,880
and or the larva dies you know it's just

1161
00:40:52,239 --> 00:40:54,399
almost

1162
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:55,760
you know the research had there had to

1163
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,599
be a lot of research and you'll often

1164
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,000
see where these trichogramma wasps will

1165
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:00,318
all

1166
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,440
target one species but there may be one

1167
00:41:00,318 --> 00:41:03,920
that's

1168
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:05,039
really good at controlling it right so

1169
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:07,760
that's why you want

1170
00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:08,159
to know what you got who are they what's

1171
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,160
where

1172
00:41:08,159 --> 00:41:11,440
when did they come and and who are they

1173
00:41:10,159 --> 00:41:12,960
and you can distinguish

1174
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:14,559
caterpillars not just by their

1175
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:17,599
appearance but their moths

1176
00:41:14,559 --> 00:41:19,358
so if you're catching the big dark moth

1177
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:22,880
and you're also catching this little

1178
00:41:19,358 --> 00:41:24,318
tiny yellow moth uh that's two species

1179
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:26,160
right well that was going to be my

1180
00:41:24,318 --> 00:41:26,880
question do you think tom has multiple

1181
00:41:26,159 --> 00:41:29,440
species

1182
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:30,000
of we only saw that that that corn ear

1183
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:32,480
worm

1184
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,000
but i didn't but we saw two of them we

1185
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:37,358
saw there's yeah they're the

1186
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,880
same species okay yeah so um so

1187
00:41:37,358 --> 00:41:40,559
possibly there's another one but it

1188
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,039
could just be it could be but we haven't

1189
00:41:40,559 --> 00:41:42,559
found it

1190
00:41:41,039 --> 00:41:45,199
right right so yeah there could be

1191
00:41:42,559 --> 00:41:47,199
although it's not so the cornier species

1192
00:41:45,199 --> 00:41:48,480
is there a specific parasitic wasp

1193
00:41:47,199 --> 00:41:51,118
species that

1194
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:52,719
love yeah yeah yeah there's uh you know

1195
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:55,760
the trigger grandmas like i said

1196
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:56,559
um i can give you more details on a list

1197
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,599
of

1198
00:41:56,559 --> 00:42:00,159
you know we have three species of

1199
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:02,000
trigorama of a list of what

1200
00:42:00,159 --> 00:42:05,118
which ones they tend to prefer and can

1201
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:08,559
have been shown to control

1202
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:10,800
um so next season

1203
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:11,599
we would be we would bring those out

1204
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:14,240
early

1205
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:15,280
yeah yeah yeah it's always preventative

1206
00:42:14,239 --> 00:42:19,118
i mean i

1207
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:20,720
i'm uh i i focus on biological control

1208
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:24,240
right i've been doing

1209
00:42:20,719 --> 00:42:27,358
pest management now for six years um

1210
00:42:24,239 --> 00:42:28,559
um in different different crops several

1211
00:42:27,358 --> 00:42:31,358
different crops

1212
00:42:28,559 --> 00:42:32,159
um but the the bulk of those years has

1213
00:42:31,358 --> 00:42:34,838
have been

1214
00:42:32,159 --> 00:42:36,399
um putting together what what are called

1215
00:42:34,838 --> 00:42:39,039
bio-intensive

1216
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:40,800
ipm programs basically they're founded

1217
00:42:39,039 --> 00:42:42,159
on on the idea that we're going to try

1218
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:45,440
to control

1219
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:48,799
our pests and diseases with

1220
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:49,119
biological agents such as so that you

1221
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:52,240
that

1222
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:53,358
okay continue but such as bt that's a

1223
00:42:52,239 --> 00:42:56,479
bacteria

1224
00:42:53,358 --> 00:42:59,440
um these wasps they're also they're

1225
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:00,960
they're also they're insects right um

1226
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:03,119
and there are other predators of

1227
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:05,280
caterpillars too so

1228
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:06,800
so basically anything that's living that

1229
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:08,160
would attack the thing you don't want

1230
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:12,960
whether it's a bacteria

1231
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:17,679
a fungus another bug what about the soil

1232
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:17,679
does it begin there um i mean

1233
00:43:17,838 --> 00:43:22,078
soil i mean that that's where everything

1234
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:25,119
starts right

1235
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:28,240
um you know the um

1236
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:29,519
plants evolved in soil right so and we

1237
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:32,879
know that nutrition

1238
00:43:29,519 --> 00:43:35,119
and um the right kind of soil but

1239
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:37,039
but something like a caterpillar would

1240
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:41,838
love to eat a super healthy plant well

1241
00:43:37,039 --> 00:43:41,838
that's what you know yeah

1242
00:43:43,358 --> 00:43:47,519
is a tough one to say that the soil soil

1243
00:43:46,239 --> 00:43:50,959
plays a big

1244
00:43:47,519 --> 00:43:52,239
big part of it but you know you have

1245
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:54,880
good soil

1246
00:43:52,239 --> 00:43:56,559
you can have a healthy plant with better

1247
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:59,599
defenses to fight off

1248
00:43:56,559 --> 00:44:00,559
certain things like the botrytis let's

1249
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:03,680
say you had

1250
00:44:00,559 --> 00:44:04,239
a flower that was grown in very good

1251
00:44:03,679 --> 00:44:05,838
soil

1252
00:44:04,239 --> 00:44:07,598
you know and by good it's a broad

1253
00:44:05,838 --> 00:44:09,199
definition of what we mean by good which

1254
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:11,119
includes microbiota

1255
00:44:09,199 --> 00:44:12,799
right but we're talking also struck

1256
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:15,838
structure of the soil and

1257
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:17,760
you know the food and

1258
00:44:15,838 --> 00:44:19,358
as well as the microbiology going on

1259
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,760
there but any number of these things

1260
00:44:19,358 --> 00:44:22,078
that can

1261
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:24,160
strengthen the plant one of the ways

1262
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:25,440
that the plant is strengthened is by its

1263
00:44:24,159 --> 00:44:28,399
tissues

1264
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:28,960
uh it's its cell walls thickening you

1265
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,960
know

1266
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:33,280
and what's that mean that means it's a

1267
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:36,559
lot tougher for a disease

1268
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:38,160
to to injure to actually some of these

1269
00:44:36,559 --> 00:44:39,838
diseases actually send

1270
00:44:38,159 --> 00:44:41,759
what are called these fungal diseases

1271
00:44:39,838 --> 00:44:43,759
send what's called an aprosoria

1272
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:45,839
which is like a drill and they'll drill

1273
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:48,640
right into tissue

1274
00:44:45,838 --> 00:44:48,960
um into the cell cells of the plant well

1275
00:44:48,639 --> 00:44:51,440
if they

1276
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:52,720
like hold on to and just to get in and

1277
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:55,838
start and then start

1278
00:44:52,719 --> 00:44:56,959
proliferating inside of it right they

1279
00:44:55,838 --> 00:45:00,159
don't even need an

1280
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:01,519
opening for them but uh you know if you

1281
00:45:00,159 --> 00:45:03,838
have

1282
00:45:01,519 --> 00:45:04,719
uh tissue that's that's more you know

1283
00:45:03,838 --> 00:45:07,119
that's that's

1284
00:45:04,719 --> 00:45:07,919
tougher right because you took care of

1285
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:11,039
giving it

1286
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:14,159
absolute perfect soil conditions

1287
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:15,920
then you have some level of there's less

1288
00:45:14,159 --> 00:45:17,679
susceptibility right and so you've

1289
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:18,639
weakened that one component of the

1290
00:45:17,679 --> 00:45:20,639
susceptible

1291
00:45:18,639 --> 00:45:22,318
sure makes sense to me yeah a little

1292
00:45:20,639 --> 00:45:23,279
disappointed because that was what this

1293
00:45:22,318 --> 00:45:26,559
was all about

1294
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:29,200
was you know yeah our trump to really

1295
00:45:26,559 --> 00:45:31,440
you know yeah builds really strong well

1296
00:45:29,199 --> 00:45:33,439
again this gets back to my question with

1297
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:34,960
is like i don't i think a super healthy

1298
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:37,358
plant a caterpillar would

1299
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:38,960
love to eat yeah sure and and at that

1300
00:45:37,358 --> 00:45:39,759
point you're you know you're talking it

1301
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:42,240
um the the

1302
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:43,520
the these things you remember these

1303
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:46,559
things looked amazing

1304
00:45:43,519 --> 00:45:47,440
two weeks ago they were just like yeah

1305
00:45:46,559 --> 00:45:49,759
that's why

1306
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:50,880
that's why botrytis and and caterpillars

1307
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:53,760
are are a bane

1308
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:55,838
in outdoor growing so okay so so

1309
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:58,000
botrytis is that something that lingers

1310
00:45:55,838 --> 00:45:59,199
like doesn't fusarium linger in the soil

1311
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,039
so even if you like

1312
00:45:59,199 --> 00:46:03,199
clear all your plants out and you plant

1313
00:46:01,039 --> 00:46:07,599
again it's just like sweet

1314
00:46:03,199 --> 00:46:10,399
yeah um so a lot of fungi will go into

1315
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:12,800
we were talking about earlier the the

1316
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:15,680
state of suspended animation

1317
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:16,800
um you know normally called a survival

1318
00:46:15,679 --> 00:46:18,480
skill to have

1319
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:20,480
yeah a survival structure so like

1320
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:23,760
powdery mildew has one

1321
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:25,280
um that it can occasionally at the end

1322
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:27,040
of its life

1323
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:30,000
form one of these structures that keeps

1324
00:46:27,039 --> 00:46:32,079
it essentially alive in this structure

1325
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:35,199
ambitious definitely has one and matter

1326
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:37,680
of fact one of the managing techniques

1327
00:46:35,199 --> 00:46:39,598
for managing strategies for managing

1328
00:46:37,679 --> 00:46:42,639
botrytis and strawberry

1329
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:45,760
is to remove infected fruit

1330
00:46:42,639 --> 00:46:46,400
from from the rose so dead fruit from

1331
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:48,240
the rose

1332
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:50,000
when you harvest the harvesters go

1333
00:46:48,239 --> 00:46:50,959
through and if they spot both try to say

1334
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,719
may i leave it

1335
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:56,800
or cut it into or they may see a

1336
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:58,480
they may drop strawberries that are

1337
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:59,359
infected with protitis well that's a

1338
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:00,960
source

1339
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:02,400
for more botrytis for the well you're

1340
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:03,679
saying they're doing this accidentally

1341
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:05,680
right not intentionally

1342
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:07,199
some sometimes they they cut them to to

1343
00:47:05,679 --> 00:47:08,879
squash them and keep them from you know

1344
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:11,039
being at least above the ground

1345
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:12,800
right so others if you ever see a

1346
00:47:11,039 --> 00:47:14,239
harvest in a strawberry field it's

1347
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,880
riddled with you know dead fruit

1348
00:47:14,239 --> 00:47:16,000
afterwards

1349
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:17,760
if you don't get in there and clean it

1350
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,400
up soon and you have infection in that

1351
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:20,480
tissue

1352
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:22,639
then you're just risking the next flush

1353
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:24,960
of strawberries right

1354
00:47:22,639 --> 00:47:26,799
same thing if you grow outdoors in an

1355
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:29,199
environment where you leave filthy

1356
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:31,039
plant residue after a harvest let's say

1357
00:47:29,199 --> 00:47:33,039
you're an outdoor grower and you happen

1358
00:47:31,039 --> 00:47:34,239
to be growing in soil and you don't do

1359
00:47:33,039 --> 00:47:37,279
something about

1360
00:47:34,239 --> 00:47:40,799
the survival structures that botrytis

1361
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:42,720
may have left in dead tissue

1362
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:44,880
you know you you you'll have it there

1363
00:47:42,719 --> 00:47:47,679
for next year and it's just waiting for

1364
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:50,000
so so the physical manifestation of

1365
00:47:47,679 --> 00:47:50,639
botrytis is bud rot basically right yeah

1366
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,559
you got it

1367
00:47:50,639 --> 00:47:54,879
that's good that's a good way to look at

1368
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:56,480
it and then what about fusarium what

1369
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:59,519
would be its physical

1370
00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:00,159
manifestation that's a number of

1371
00:47:59,519 --> 00:48:03,759
different

1372
00:48:00,159 --> 00:48:05,679
uh symptoms um

1373
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:07,359
the most common so fusarium is one of

1374
00:48:05,679 --> 00:48:09,598
the wilt diseases

1375
00:48:07,358 --> 00:48:11,358
right so the plant everyone knows what a

1376
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:13,760
wilting plant looks like

1377
00:48:11,358 --> 00:48:14,960
um what's interesting about fusarium is

1378
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:17,200
you know if you have a plant that

1379
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:18,880
that wilted because you forgot to turn

1380
00:48:17,199 --> 00:48:20,558
the water on for an hour

1381
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:22,400
and you run out there you turn it back

1382
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:24,400
on it'll it'll pops right back

1383
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:26,480
up but you you won't do that it won't do

1384
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:27,119
that if it's in affected with fusarium

1385
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:29,199
right because

1386
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:30,720
because what fusarium does it it gets in

1387
00:48:29,199 --> 00:48:33,759
from the soil

1388
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:36,799
and it um it actually plugs the vac

1389
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:39,839
vascular system of plants right

1390
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:40,400
so even if the water even if the soil is

1391
00:48:39,838 --> 00:48:42,318
wet

1392
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:43,838
they just can't pull water up and so

1393
00:48:42,318 --> 00:48:45,838
there's just

1394
00:48:43,838 --> 00:48:47,039
chronic wilt where they're not getting

1395
00:48:45,838 --> 00:48:49,838
the water they need

1396
00:48:47,039 --> 00:48:52,400
right that's typical the other one the

1397
00:48:49,838 --> 00:48:55,358
other fusarium

1398
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:57,358
symptom would be when a plant dies and

1399
00:48:55,358 --> 00:48:59,838
let's say it didn't even die from wilt

1400
00:48:57,358 --> 00:49:01,119
you can cut the the base of the stem

1401
00:48:59,838 --> 00:49:03,759
usually

1402
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:05,119
usually the further down you go the the

1403
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:07,760
pith the inside

1404
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:09,039
is is is brown it's not the healthy

1405
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:11,119
light green color or

1406
00:49:09,039 --> 00:49:12,159
almost you know yellow color it's brown

1407
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:15,200
and soft

1408
00:49:12,159 --> 00:49:18,000
right and that that could be

1409
00:49:15,199 --> 00:49:18,399
one of these wilt diseases best thing to

1410
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,480
do

1411
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:21,760
you know you know we know we know

1412
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:24,800
fusarium

1413
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:26,720
um lives in soil too and that's how it

1414
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:30,400
moves around through the roots

1415
00:49:26,719 --> 00:49:33,279
um you know if you have old soil

1416
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:34,000
and it's in there you know you're you're

1417
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:36,400
risking

1418
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,760
the next crop right so what can you do

1419
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:39,838
there's a lot of things you can do

1420
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:41,680
right i just that was going to be my

1421
00:49:39,838 --> 00:49:43,199
question yeah so

1422
00:49:41,679 --> 00:49:44,960
let's think about what the strawberry

1423
00:49:43,199 --> 00:49:47,118
growers do they suffer from these wilt

1424
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:49,119
diseases as well

1425
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:51,119
they conventional strawberry growers

1426
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:52,960
will use what's called methyl bromide

1427
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:55,200
have you heard of that

1428
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:56,159
substance that's been it doesn't sound

1429
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:58,558
good it's close

1430
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:59,838
it's it's close to being to being banned

1431
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:02,960
completely but

1432
00:49:59,838 --> 00:50:04,078
um if they did my understanding is if

1433
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:06,079
they banned it out right

1434
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:07,359
strawberry the strawberry uh industry

1435
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:09,599
would really suffer

1436
00:50:07,358 --> 00:50:10,960
uh because so like everybody's using it

1437
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:12,800
yeah well no no

1438
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:14,639
not everyone's using it but but it's

1439
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:15,359
still it's still something that could i

1440
00:50:14,639 --> 00:50:16,960
think

1441
00:50:15,358 --> 00:50:18,480
really hurt the strawberry industry if

1442
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:20,159
somebody just organized strawberry

1443
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:23,199
growers no you can't okay

1444
00:50:20,159 --> 00:50:25,519
it's a toxic so buy organic strawberries

1445
00:50:23,199 --> 00:50:26,799
it's a toxin that's actually fumigated

1446
00:50:25,519 --> 00:50:28,639
into the soil

1447
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:30,160
and there are fields out there where if

1448
00:50:28,639 --> 00:50:33,679
you didn't do that

1449
00:50:30,159 --> 00:50:35,199
within a maybe two cycles you're you're

1450
00:50:33,679 --> 00:50:37,759
just losing money you might as well not

1451
00:50:35,199 --> 00:50:41,039
climb what is it combating a a rot

1452
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:43,920
the the uh the storage uh the the uh

1453
00:50:41,039 --> 00:50:44,800
the survival structures the fusarium in

1454
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:46,880
this oil and

1455
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:48,079
other other soil diseases not just

1456
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:50,079
fusing what um

1457
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:51,280
when apples rot what is it that's

1458
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:53,920
rotting them the

1459
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:55,280
famous oh there are a lot there's a lot

1460
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:57,920
of rotten uh

1461
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:59,920
uh apple rot diseases out there um i'm

1462
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:01,519
not an apple expert but there there's

1463
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:03,039
there's quite a few fire blights a big

1464
00:51:01,519 --> 00:51:06,000
one that bacteria

1465
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:07,039
um that that well so how come banana

1466
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,519
growers are so

1467
00:51:07,039 --> 00:51:11,440
fucked with a fusarium is it like more

1468
00:51:09,519 --> 00:51:12,639
vicious once it gets into soil that

1469
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:14,159
bananas are in because it

1470
00:51:12,639 --> 00:51:15,519
seems like you're like oh strawberry

1471
00:51:14,159 --> 00:51:17,519
growers get it all the time but they're

1472
00:51:15,519 --> 00:51:19,599
not like we need to abandon these 10

1473
00:51:17,519 --> 00:51:22,000
acres for the next 30 years

1474
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:23,359
not 30 years or like burn the fields not

1475
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,280
30 years but they will

1476
00:51:23,358 --> 00:51:27,358
they will take breaks and grow something

1477
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:27,839
else because if you just keep it going

1478
00:51:27,358 --> 00:51:29,679
you don't

1479
00:51:27,838 --> 00:51:31,838
you just don't not allow enough time for

1480
00:51:29,679 --> 00:51:32,558
that fungus to those survival structures

1481
00:51:31,838 --> 00:51:35,199
to

1482
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:36,319
to you know not you know but i thought

1483
00:51:35,199 --> 00:51:38,719
that period is like

1484
00:51:36,318 --> 00:51:40,480
years and years and years it's like like

1485
00:51:38,719 --> 00:51:42,159
i'll just hang out until you come back

1486
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:44,800
but it depends on the pathogen

1487
00:51:42,159 --> 00:51:45,199
right where does fusion feed on it it's

1488
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:47,680
a

1489
00:51:45,199 --> 00:51:48,399
it's a bacteria yeah so it's a fungus

1490
00:51:47,679 --> 00:51:51,598
that gets

1491
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:54,960
yeah it gets into the plant through um

1492
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:56,720
through the roots makes its way up the

1493
00:51:54,960 --> 00:52:01,199
vascular system

1494
00:51:56,719 --> 00:52:04,639
feeds on whatever sap is going through

1495
00:52:01,199 --> 00:52:08,318
begins to multiply as it grows

1496
00:52:04,639 --> 00:52:09,719
it causes clogging of the vascular it's

1497
00:52:08,318 --> 00:52:11,519
kind of like i guess

1498
00:52:09,719 --> 00:52:13,039
arthrosclerosis kind of yeah i was gonna

1499
00:52:11,519 --> 00:52:15,358
say getting like uh

1500
00:52:13,039 --> 00:52:18,880
yeah like clogged arteries or whatever

1501
00:52:15,358 --> 00:52:23,039
yeah yeah pre-heart attack

1502
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:25,039
wow okay but the good news is tom

1503
00:52:23,039 --> 00:52:25,759
doesn't have fusarium in addition to

1504
00:52:25,039 --> 00:52:28,159
betraytus

1505
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:29,599
and butter and yeah we wouldn't know but

1506
00:52:28,159 --> 00:52:31,279
you know

1507
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:33,119
going back to our conversation we had

1508
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:35,280
last sunday with uh

1509
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:36,318
with chris you know we talked again

1510
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:38,880
about

1511
00:52:36,318 --> 00:52:40,239
endophytes and you know relationships

1512
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:43,519
and

1513
00:52:40,239 --> 00:52:44,199
you know we we ourselves have all kinds

1514
00:52:43,519 --> 00:52:47,199
of

1515
00:52:44,199 --> 00:52:47,919
microorganisms living in us right and on

1516
00:52:47,199 --> 00:52:50,399
us

1517
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:53,039
you know the the micro flora in some

1518
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:56,079
cases they're beneficial in other cases

1519
00:52:53,039 --> 00:52:58,079
they could kill us but

1520
00:52:56,079 --> 00:53:00,240
they may not they may just be living in

1521
00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:00,240
us

1522
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:04,559
because we have a nutrient nutritional

1523
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:08,240
source for them but they don't

1524
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:10,880
explode to such levels of infection that

1525
00:53:08,239 --> 00:53:12,639
they will harm us you know so we could

1526
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:14,720
have all kinds of pathogens in us that

1527
00:53:12,639 --> 00:53:16,799
could kill us

1528
00:53:14,719 --> 00:53:17,838
and and the way it happens with with

1529
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:19,440
humans is

1530
00:53:17,838 --> 00:53:21,119
it's the same thing that happens in

1531
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:24,000
plants is

1532
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:25,200
um some kind of susceptibility is

1533
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:28,480
increase in the human

1534
00:53:25,199 --> 00:53:30,960
can be from a stress it could be um

1535
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:31,519
from another disease for example um some

1536
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:35,440
of the

1537
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:37,280
um immuno some of these diseases that

1538
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:39,920
affect the immune system for example

1539
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:40,880
um aids aids affects the immune system

1540
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:42,400
right lupus

1541
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:43,838
and then it's something else that kills

1542
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:45,039
it and then something that was already

1543
00:53:43,838 --> 00:53:47,119
in you

1544
00:53:45,039 --> 00:53:48,318
that was being kept at bay because

1545
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:51,200
you're mowing yeah

1546
00:53:48,318 --> 00:53:51,679
yeah and it pops up same deal so um i

1547
00:53:51,199 --> 00:53:54,078
mentioned

1548
00:53:51,679 --> 00:53:55,118
a plant pathologist that i've worked

1549
00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:58,160
with for years now

1550
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:59,838
um steve koike and he's seen enough he's

1551
00:53:58,159 --> 00:54:01,679
seen enough plants now i mean

1552
00:53:59,838 --> 00:54:03,519
i've asked him this question a number of

1553
00:54:01,679 --> 00:54:04,960
times and last i saw him was about a

1554
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:07,039
month ago and

1555
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:08,800
he he was still wondering about that is

1556
00:54:07,039 --> 00:54:10,079
how much fusarium is there out there

1557
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:11,839
we're just not seeing

1558
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:13,280
is it really a problem or is it a

1559
00:54:11,838 --> 00:54:16,558
problem

1560
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:19,680
under certain circumstances is

1561
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:22,960
is this host susceptibility do we mean

1562
00:54:19,679 --> 00:54:23,679
probably yeah or in humans uh no no in

1563
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:26,240
in plants

1564
00:54:23,679 --> 00:54:26,799
yeah so in cannabis specifically yeah i

1565
00:54:26,239 --> 00:54:29,439
mean we

1566
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:31,359
found um we found fusarium but it was

1567
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:32,400
interesting uh it was first time i took

1568
00:54:31,358 --> 00:54:34,480
it to the lab

1569
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:35,680
uh i think we collected 30 plants that

1570
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:37,119
had symptoms

1571
00:54:35,679 --> 00:54:39,838
we sent them in and two of them had

1572
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:39,838
fusarium

1573
00:54:40,159 --> 00:54:43,679
you know none of the rest could be

1574
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:46,159
detected by any of the

1575
00:54:43,679 --> 00:54:47,199
symptoms i mean steve plated them out

1576
00:54:46,159 --> 00:54:49,118
for us

1577
00:54:47,199 --> 00:54:50,639
once once it grows a few days it's

1578
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:52,400
pretty easy for any

1579
00:54:50,639 --> 00:54:54,078
microbiologist plant pathologist can

1580
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:56,000
identify usually

1581
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:58,318
by looking at the the petri dish it was

1582
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:02,159
grown in right

1583
00:54:58,318 --> 00:55:04,239
so you know okay so what's the deal here

1584
00:55:02,159 --> 00:55:07,039
these do these have it obvi it sounds to

1585
00:55:04,239 --> 00:55:08,719
me like the symptoms in these plants

1586
00:55:07,039 --> 00:55:10,318
even though the same as in these two

1587
00:55:08,719 --> 00:55:11,199
plants is the same as these eight over

1588
00:55:10,318 --> 00:55:14,400
here

1589
00:55:11,199 --> 00:55:17,838
um it may not be related to fusarium

1590
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:18,400
right so 30 of the 32 plants did not

1591
00:55:17,838 --> 00:55:19,920
have it

1592
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:21,599
even though they all expressed the sound

1593
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:23,838
yeah yeah it was so did they know what

1594
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:25,440
those other plants had

1595
00:55:23,838 --> 00:55:27,440
they didn't test you know they had

1596
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:30,720
mosaic appearance of the leaves you've

1597
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:34,480
you've heard about the mosaic viruses uh

1598
00:55:30,719 --> 00:55:36,798
you know also affecting the the crop um

1599
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:38,159
they looked like mosaic they did not

1600
00:55:36,798 --> 00:55:38,639
have any mosaic he put them through a

1601
00:55:38,159 --> 00:55:41,759
panel

1602
00:55:38,639 --> 00:55:42,798
of of different pathogens and basically

1603
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:44,640
all he found was

1604
00:55:42,798 --> 00:55:46,079
fusarium now this was before we knew

1605
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:48,480
about the viroid so

1606
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:49,200
if that my expression would be hotplate

1607
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:51,358
and viroid

1608
00:55:49,199 --> 00:55:52,318
we don't know because at that at that

1609
00:55:51,358 --> 00:55:55,519
time

1610
00:55:52,318 --> 00:55:57,279
i don't think the viroid um i think

1611
00:55:55,519 --> 00:56:00,480
they're called the primers which is

1612
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:01,519
the what you need for the test wasn't

1613
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:03,599
really

1614
00:56:01,519 --> 00:56:06,000
commonly available because it was just

1615
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:09,359
kind of we were barely learning about it

1616
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:12,480
i i very clearly remember coming back

1617
00:56:09,358 --> 00:56:15,358
from that uh you know from

1618
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:16,880
when we sampled um it wasn't until

1619
00:56:15,358 --> 00:56:19,119
months or probably even a year later

1620
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:22,400
when i first heard about the viroid

1621
00:56:19,119 --> 00:56:24,480
right and um had you seen what turned

1622
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:26,079
out to be the viroid much earlier and

1623
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:27,920
then when people told you that there was

1624
00:56:26,079 --> 00:56:28,480
this viroid and this is what it does you

1625
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:30,639
were like

1626
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:32,880
i've seen you know you know the testing

1627
00:56:30,639 --> 00:56:36,318
the heavy testing for viroid

1628
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:38,960
happened after i left

1629
00:56:36,318 --> 00:56:40,480
um where i worked and and moved to

1630
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:42,159
beneficial insectary

1631
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:44,960
that was really when everyone started to

1632
00:56:42,159 --> 00:56:46,960
really key in on testing and um

1633
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:49,358
some places went out and tested all

1634
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:51,760
their um you know their mother tissue

1635
00:56:49,358 --> 00:56:52,639
every single plant and eliminated every

1636
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:55,119
one that

1637
00:56:52,639 --> 00:56:57,440
that had the virate in it so it was it

1638
00:56:55,119 --> 00:57:00,559
was a it was some time ago that you know

1639
00:56:57,440 --> 00:57:02,400
i i learned about fusarium actually

1640
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:04,079
you know potentially being a problem in

1641
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:05,920
cannabis before i learned about the

1642
00:57:04,079 --> 00:57:06,720
virus it's like every year there's some

1643
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:08,639
new diseases

1644
00:57:06,719 --> 00:57:10,318
oh yeah it's not even every year it's

1645
00:57:08,639 --> 00:57:11,039
everything i went in on this cannabis

1646
00:57:10,318 --> 00:57:13,039
party too

1647
00:57:11,039 --> 00:57:14,159
and fusarium where does it come from

1648
00:57:13,039 --> 00:57:15,838
like where would it

1649
00:57:14,159 --> 00:57:17,838
come from how would it be introduced it

1650
00:57:15,838 --> 00:57:20,318
could also be a survival structure

1651
00:57:17,838 --> 00:57:22,159
a mommy and a daddy pusarium have a baby

1652
00:57:20,318 --> 00:57:23,519
for cereal

1653
00:57:22,159 --> 00:57:26,879
yeah i mean how do they get into your

1654
00:57:23,519 --> 00:57:26,880
garden i mean brought in

1655
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:34,480
it could be in there could be that

1656
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:35,599
some other plant here in your garden is

1657
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:38,000
susceptible to it

1658
00:57:35,599 --> 00:57:40,000
and there are survival structures and

1659
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:42,318
you were watering your lawn one day yeah

1660
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:44,400
so the same strain of fusarium could be

1661
00:57:42,318 --> 00:57:45,039
infecting other plants species yeah well

1662
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:48,240
okay well

1663
00:57:45,039 --> 00:57:51,519
um there i know of at least two

1664
00:57:48,239 --> 00:57:52,558
i think it's three species of fusarium

1665
00:57:51,519 --> 00:57:56,480
that we found

1666
00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:57,920
at in our soil right one of them

1667
00:57:56,480 --> 00:58:00,240
the one that's thought to be the main

1668
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:03,200
culprit is fusarium oxysporum

1669
00:58:00,239 --> 00:58:04,399
and that's the the same one that hits

1670
00:58:03,199 --> 00:58:06,159
other crops

1671
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:07,680
like give me an example of another crop

1672
00:58:06,159 --> 00:58:09,519
that it loves i like that's strawberries

1673
00:58:07,679 --> 00:58:12,719
that's the main fusion but

1674
00:58:09,519 --> 00:58:14,639
so basically it's like yeah i mean

1675
00:58:12,719 --> 00:58:16,000
that that's like a super disease that

1676
00:58:14,639 --> 00:58:19,039
can like you know how

1677
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:21,119
like uh coronavirus it's like

1678
00:58:19,039 --> 00:58:22,798
they don't think necessarily cats and

1679
00:58:21,119 --> 00:58:23,119
dogs like we couldn't transmit it to a

1680
00:58:22,798 --> 00:58:25,358
cat

1681
00:58:23,119 --> 00:58:26,880
they can transmit it to a person but

1682
00:58:25,358 --> 00:58:27,759
with this it's like it could go from

1683
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:29,599
like

1684
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:31,359
tom's cannabis plant to like the

1685
00:58:29,599 --> 00:58:33,039
neighbors strawberries and then like the

1686
00:58:31,358 --> 00:58:34,318
next neighbor is growing weed and it's

1687
00:58:33,039 --> 00:58:36,798
like what's that like

1688
00:58:34,318 --> 00:58:39,199
exactly so you do yes i can find food

1689
00:58:36,798 --> 00:58:41,039
sources yeah there's uh there are

1690
00:58:39,199 --> 00:58:43,118
there are really interesting

1691
00:58:41,039 --> 00:58:45,759
strawberries and wheat and socal

1692
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:47,519
well like fusarium i got one for you in

1693
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:48,240
the middle of the state where you have

1694
00:58:47,519 --> 00:58:50,159
all these different

1695
00:58:48,239 --> 00:58:52,558
central coasts well you're surrounded by

1696
00:58:50,159 --> 00:58:57,118
them um i got another one for you

1697
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:58,720
okay um so so think about this so the um

1698
00:58:57,119 --> 00:59:00,559
i was talking about grapes and botrytis

1699
00:58:58,719 --> 00:59:02,078
right um

1700
00:59:00,559 --> 00:59:03,839
so the grape that the grapes are

1701
00:59:02,079 --> 00:59:04,720
typically affected by botrytis are the

1702
00:59:03,838 --> 00:59:06,000
pinot noir

1703
00:59:04,719 --> 00:59:08,798
and chardonnay grape those are very

1704
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:10,480
commonly that's a very common fungal

1705
00:59:08,798 --> 00:59:11,679
problem these are thin skin grapes

1706
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:12,240
remember we talked about that they're

1707
00:59:11,679 --> 00:59:15,199
not very

1708
00:59:12,239 --> 00:59:16,879
tolerant of very high temperatures so

1709
00:59:15,199 --> 00:59:17,679
they could easily get sunburned and

1710
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:20,000
damaged

1711
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:20,960
so that's why they're normal specific

1712
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:24,079
regions

1713
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:25,039
still coastal cool climates that also

1714
00:59:24,079 --> 00:59:28,240
happen to have

1715
00:59:25,039 --> 00:59:30,000
a high humidity so that they have a very

1716
00:59:28,239 --> 00:59:32,318
susceptible host with the thin

1717
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:34,079
cluster thin skins that are clustered

1718
00:59:32,318 --> 00:59:36,480
tight and then they have the

1719
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:38,160
the perfect environment and then as soon

1720
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:39,039
as that spore lands there guess what you

1721
00:59:38,159 --> 00:59:42,879
have the disease

1722
00:59:39,039 --> 00:59:46,960
the triangle components right so

1723
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:46,960
but try this scenario is

1724
00:59:47,679 --> 00:59:52,399
yeah yeah at some point there had to

1725
00:59:50,798 --> 00:59:55,599
have been some kind of weather

1726
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:57,440
event um i'm pretty convinced it was the

1727
00:59:55,599 --> 01:00:00,240
the heat wave because okay how about

1728
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:02,240
this so we have a new batch of auto

1729
01:00:00,239 --> 01:00:05,519
babies that i just brought over

1730
01:00:02,239 --> 01:00:07,358
so they'll be susceptible yeah

1731
01:00:05,519 --> 01:00:08,719
but wouldn't it imply that they need the

1732
01:00:07,358 --> 01:00:11,279
same shitty like

1733
01:00:08,719 --> 01:00:11,759
weather event yeah but let's think about

1734
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:13,440
this

1735
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:15,920
we can talk about macro environments

1736
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:18,400
right since it's already here

1737
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:19,838
it could easily get to them okay so so

1738
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:21,440
let's talk about the macro environment

1739
01:00:19,838 --> 01:00:23,039
right that was behind you as well don't

1740
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:24,960
forget the other we got it everywhere

1741
01:00:23,039 --> 01:00:26,159
yeah yeah so there's there's not a plant

1742
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:28,880
that does not essentially there

1743
01:00:26,159 --> 01:00:29,358
it's like covered right yeah even in the

1744
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:32,480
white house

1745
01:00:29,358 --> 01:00:34,239
okay yeah um have you have you ever

1746
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:36,480
noticed how your biggest

1747
01:00:34,239 --> 01:00:38,719
buds that top cola are the ones that are

1748
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:42,639
normally first affected by

1749
01:00:38,719 --> 01:00:45,279
botrytis right so you can see it

1750
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:46,318
have you and then second question is um

1751
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:47,920
those were the ones that you were

1752
01:00:46,318 --> 01:00:49,358
trimming where you saw it first

1753
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:50,960
right you cut those off because they

1754
01:00:49,358 --> 01:00:52,960
were the top bud yeah right

1755
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:54,318
that's usually a really big bud up there

1756
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:55,920
right well we

1757
01:00:54,318 --> 01:00:58,079
cut those because tom didn't want the

1758
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:58,639
neighbor to see his gigantic plants so

1759
01:00:58,079 --> 01:01:00,559
okay

1760
01:00:58,639 --> 01:01:02,239
all right so you injured the plant we

1761
01:01:00,559 --> 01:01:03,680
gave it to them gave their botrytis and

1762
01:01:02,239 --> 01:01:06,959
entry

1763
01:01:03,679 --> 01:01:06,960
but uh but yeah so

1764
01:01:07,039 --> 01:01:10,318
what about that micro environment inside

1765
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:11,920
the flower have you noticed that

1766
01:01:10,318 --> 01:01:14,558
botrytis starts from

1767
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:16,079
inside the flower right the gray mold

1768
01:01:14,559 --> 01:01:17,839
usually i mean i'm not saying it doesn't

1769
01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:18,559
on occasion start on the outside tissue

1770
01:01:17,838 --> 01:01:21,838
even

1771
01:01:18,559 --> 01:01:23,680
even on stems you'll see botrytis

1772
01:01:21,838 --> 01:01:24,880
i haven't seen that routinely but i have

1773
01:01:23,679 --> 01:01:27,919
seen it

1774
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:28,400
that big flower which is tight um that's

1775
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:30,318
not one

1776
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:31,599
solid piece of plant there's nooks and

1777
01:01:30,318 --> 01:01:33,519
crannies in there right

1778
01:01:31,599 --> 01:01:35,519
and we're talking about microscopic

1779
01:01:33,519 --> 01:01:36,079
spores right so we're talking about a

1780
01:01:35,519 --> 01:01:37,838
very

1781
01:01:36,079 --> 01:01:39,359
humid environment in there right and

1782
01:01:37,838 --> 01:01:42,719
it's also dark and co

1783
01:01:39,358 --> 01:01:44,880
and you know so even something like

1784
01:01:42,719 --> 01:01:46,318
raising the humidity for a few hours at

1785
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:48,798
the wrong to oh

1786
01:01:46,318 --> 01:01:49,599
that that big bud once it's closed up

1787
01:01:48,798 --> 01:01:52,000
and gotten tight

1788
01:01:49,599 --> 01:01:53,359
that's close to harvest right what

1789
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:56,639
happens to fruit once it

1790
01:01:53,358 --> 01:01:59,199
it's closer to harvest it softens right

1791
01:01:56,639 --> 01:02:01,358
all of a sudden now that hose is much

1792
01:01:59,199 --> 01:02:04,239
more susceptible

1793
01:02:01,358 --> 01:02:06,239
because it's began to it started to

1794
01:02:04,239 --> 01:02:08,879
decompose it's part of the

1795
01:02:06,239 --> 01:02:09,759
natural plant process to decompose

1796
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:12,480
tissues get

1797
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:13,599
thinner and more easy to for the for the

1798
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:15,119
week

1799
01:02:13,599 --> 01:02:16,880
fungus what's happening it's weak it's

1800
01:02:15,119 --> 01:02:19,760
vulnerable it's weaker

1801
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:20,480
it's softer it's full of sugar it's it's

1802
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:22,559
it's

1803
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:24,880
it's got spores inside it's like a

1804
01:02:22,559 --> 01:02:26,480
salmon that swum all the way upstream

1805
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:26,960
and the bear is just sitting there being

1806
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:30,318
like

1807
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:32,960
this is too easy right you got it it's

1808
01:02:30,318 --> 01:02:34,000
tired good analogy good analogy so so

1809
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:36,400
each part of these this

1810
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:38,719
triangle can can can give you a

1811
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:41,440
different impact in this case you had

1812
01:02:38,719 --> 01:02:42,318
a the susceptible host was caused you

1813
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:44,159
know

1814
01:02:42,318 --> 01:02:45,920
if you notice it started on your biggest

1815
01:02:44,159 --> 01:02:47,920
buds so the ones that were the ripest

1816
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:49,039
were more susceptible and the

1817
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:52,079
caterpillars came

1818
01:02:49,039 --> 01:02:55,119
bit holes into them and allowed faster

1819
01:02:52,079 --> 01:02:57,200
entry into the flower and

1820
01:02:55,119 --> 01:02:58,798
you you basically you got susceptibility

1821
01:02:57,199 --> 01:03:01,519
of hose maybe the environment didn't

1822
01:02:58,798 --> 01:03:03,838
have as much to do with it

1823
01:03:01,519 --> 01:03:06,400
this time around um you know but there

1824
01:03:03,838 --> 01:03:08,159
was presence there of of the uh

1825
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:09,440
of the fungus there was uh

1826
01:03:08,159 --> 01:03:11,358
susceptibility

1827
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:13,119
and and the environment had to have been

1828
01:03:11,358 --> 01:03:17,199
at some point perfect for it to have

1829
01:03:13,119 --> 01:03:19,920
um germinated yeah we did it tom

1830
01:03:17,199 --> 01:03:19,919
we're so proud

1831
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:24,240
actually you know this is the biggest

1832
01:03:22,159 --> 01:03:27,279
colders the ones at the top were the

1833
01:03:24,239 --> 01:03:29,118
last ones they see yeah i don't know

1834
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:30,640
i don't know they were pretty brown up

1835
01:03:29,119 --> 01:03:33,519
there well now they are

1836
01:03:30,639 --> 01:03:34,798
yeah you you've got i mean i it's kind

1837
01:03:33,519 --> 01:03:38,159
of remarkable i don't know

1838
01:03:34,798 --> 01:03:41,358
um like to see

1839
01:03:38,159 --> 01:03:43,920
i mean how much feces is out there it's

1840
01:03:41,358 --> 01:03:45,279
practically every bud have you never

1841
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:48,559
seen have you

1842
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:51,280
is this like the most feces in a like

1843
01:03:48,559 --> 01:03:52,880
yeah plant that you've seen my god we

1844
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:55,119
are breaking records

1845
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:56,960
and you've seen a lot of commercial

1846
01:03:55,119 --> 01:03:59,039
facilities hey listen you learn you

1847
01:03:56,960 --> 01:04:01,119
learn about a really important symptom

1848
01:03:59,039 --> 01:04:03,039
and um you know now you know to monitor

1849
01:04:01,119 --> 01:04:06,079
for mods early you know okay right

1850
01:04:03,039 --> 01:04:08,400
so the recap for next year's start what

1851
01:04:06,079 --> 01:04:11,680
what's our prescriptive strategy again

1852
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:12,480
what i do what i do is that your

1853
01:04:11,679 --> 01:04:14,639
daughter

1854
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:16,719
gemma yeah give her a quarter for every

1855
01:04:14,639 --> 01:04:19,199
caterpillar she brings to you

1856
01:04:16,719 --> 01:04:21,358
right and then get everyone and maybe it

1857
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:23,199
is only cornea worm right now you know

1858
01:04:21,358 --> 01:04:24,639
now we can use cream sandwiches there

1859
01:04:23,199 --> 01:04:26,159
you go

1860
01:04:24,639 --> 01:04:27,440
now we can look for what does that moth

1861
01:04:26,159 --> 01:04:29,358
look like now you're gonna have to set

1862
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:31,920
up traps probably at some point

1863
01:04:29,358 --> 01:04:33,279
right start setting up uh light traps

1864
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:34,480
are a good way you know a lot mods are

1865
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:36,798
attracted to light

1866
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:38,639
um is there a pheromone trap that's like

1867
01:04:36,798 --> 01:04:40,880
literally the zapping light

1868
01:04:38,639 --> 01:04:41,920
oh any light right mods fly around these

1869
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:43,760
light bulbs right

1870
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:45,519
no no but but you're saying put a trap

1871
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:47,440
out yeah you don't have to put a zapping

1872
01:04:45,519 --> 01:04:49,038
trap that'll destroy it but a sticky

1873
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:50,639
card trap or something like that

1874
01:04:49,039 --> 01:04:52,160
you can buy moth traps that are based on

1875
01:04:50,639 --> 01:04:53,598
glue to you know so

1876
01:04:52,159 --> 01:04:55,199
maybe that's a way to do it there's also

1877
01:04:53,599 --> 01:04:56,880
what are called the delta traps you may

1878
01:04:55,199 --> 01:04:57,279
have seen them the county puts them out

1879
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:59,200
for

1880
01:04:57,280 --> 01:05:00,720
different flying pests it's a little

1881
01:04:59,199 --> 01:05:01,598
folded looks like a little tent little

1882
01:05:00,719 --> 01:05:04,399
paper tent

1883
01:05:01,599 --> 01:05:06,079
that's hung in the tree that has glue

1884
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:07,760
all on the inside and it has a little

1885
01:05:06,079 --> 01:05:09,440
pheromone which is actually intended to

1886
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:11,200
attract the male now if you capture some

1887
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:12,639
of those moths that'll tell you what

1888
01:05:11,199 --> 01:05:14,000
kind of caterpillars you're going to

1889
01:05:12,639 --> 01:05:17,279
wind up with right maybe

1890
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:20,639
yeah maybe perhaps maybe well

1891
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:21,200
okay so um i'm never i'm never a sleep

1892
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:23,598
roller

1893
01:05:21,199 --> 01:05:24,719
is it a problem in cannabis i've never

1894
01:05:23,599 --> 01:05:27,760
heard of any of these

1895
01:05:24,719 --> 01:05:30,239
leaf roller families being a problem

1896
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:31,839
in cannabis i have heard of them showing

1897
01:05:30,239 --> 01:05:33,679
up and feeding a bit

1898
01:05:31,838 --> 01:05:35,038
um right but what's the what's the one

1899
01:05:33,679 --> 01:05:37,759
tom has but here

1900
01:05:35,039 --> 01:05:39,440
it's a corn ear worm and what what's the

1901
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:41,119
adult version of that called

1902
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:42,960
it's uh this is the same coordinate

1903
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:45,559
cornea yeah it's a corner of moth

1904
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:47,280
current cornea butterfly it's

1905
01:05:45,559 --> 01:05:49,039
helicoverpasea what's the difference

1906
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:52,160
between a moth and a butterfly

1907
01:05:49,039 --> 01:05:55,440
uh mostly mods are

1908
01:05:52,159 --> 01:05:56,558
night flyers mostly okay that makes

1909
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:58,798
sense yeah yeah

1910
01:05:56,559 --> 01:05:59,839
but um likewise most most butter i think

1911
01:05:58,798 --> 01:06:02,159
that's i mean there's there's

1912
01:05:59,838 --> 01:06:03,838
families there's i mean there's there's

1913
01:06:02,159 --> 01:06:05,838
i'm i'm really nice yeah i never really

1914
01:06:03,838 --> 01:06:08,000
see caterpillars flying around at night

1915
01:06:05,838 --> 01:06:10,480
i'm not good at what i call the the

1916
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:12,400
order lepidoptera it's a tough one it's

1917
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:14,400
i mean distinguishing leaf roller mods

1918
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:17,280
from each other

1919
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:18,720
that gave me fits in school um to turn

1920
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:21,280
them over that'll be all training

1921
01:06:18,719 --> 01:06:21,919
i'll train gemma in that skill yeah well

1922
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:24,798
so

1923
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:26,880
we we don't know but but we i've never

1924
01:06:24,798 --> 01:06:28,798
seen mealybug in in

1925
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:30,720
in cannabis and i've heard some people

1926
01:06:28,798 --> 01:06:32,239
say oh yeah i've seen it and

1927
01:06:30,719 --> 01:06:33,919
i kind of found it hard to believe it's

1928
01:06:32,239 --> 01:06:35,838
like i've never seen it well

1929
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:37,280
that's that's a little bit arrogant um

1930
01:06:35,838 --> 01:06:40,798
just because i haven't seen it

1931
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:44,000
um i got a photo of some from texas

1932
01:06:40,798 --> 01:06:45,599
a few months ago so maybe leaf rollers

1933
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,318
aren't a problem in california cannabis

1934
01:06:45,599 --> 01:06:48,318
but

1935
01:06:46,318 --> 01:06:49,358
what's it going to do to oklahoma right

1936
01:06:48,318 --> 01:06:50,639
so

1937
01:06:49,358 --> 01:06:52,400
knowing what's around and what's going

1938
01:06:50,639 --> 01:06:54,558
on regional pests

1939
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:56,960
so so what were you seeing a lot of in

1940
01:06:54,559 --> 01:06:58,079
in norcal well actually on socal too

1941
01:06:56,960 --> 01:07:00,400
you're up and down the coast so what

1942
01:06:58,079 --> 01:07:02,400
were you saying

1943
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:03,760
oh so we have what everyone's getting

1944
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:04,160
it's it's not the only one they're

1945
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:07,200
getting

1946
01:07:04,159 --> 01:07:10,318
i um actually but like this is

1947
01:07:07,199 --> 01:07:11,519
a noticeable uptick in this across

1948
01:07:10,318 --> 01:07:14,960
california

1949
01:07:11,519 --> 01:07:16,318
from previous years no no

1950
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:18,318
in fact it could could have been a

1951
01:07:16,318 --> 01:07:19,838
pretty okay year but

1952
01:07:18,318 --> 01:07:21,679
actually the some of the lake county

1953
01:07:19,838 --> 01:07:26,239
growers i work with

1954
01:07:21,679 --> 01:07:28,000
they they are reporting um

1955
01:07:26,239 --> 01:07:29,439
they are reporting a bad caterpillar

1956
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:31,838
like okay lake county

1957
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:34,000
yeah so like the caterpillars are honed

1958
01:07:31,838 --> 01:07:36,318
into some different regions so i was at

1959
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,280
um a greenhouse operation in salinas

1960
01:07:36,318 --> 01:07:39,759
there's a caterpillar

1961
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:41,280
um and you know we found the damage we

1962
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:42,000
found the damage i could see it it's

1963
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:44,480
like okay it's a matter

1964
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:45,039
of time no turds i don't see any feces

1965
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:46,318
at all

1966
01:07:45,039 --> 01:07:48,079
just a matter of looking around and

1967
01:07:46,318 --> 01:07:51,759
there he was about that long

1968
01:07:48,079 --> 01:07:53,280
this is not does not look like a cornea

1969
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:54,079
worm but i'm not positive like i said a

1970
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:55,440
lot of

1971
01:07:54,079 --> 01:07:57,599
a lot of these wait is that the one from

1972
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:58,960
here no this is from a grown salinas

1973
01:07:57,599 --> 01:08:01,119
like i caught it yesterday

1974
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:02,079
because it could be younger it could be

1975
01:08:01,119 --> 01:08:04,240
a younger one

1976
01:08:02,079 --> 01:08:05,680
yeah it was bright green it even painted

1977
01:08:04,239 --> 01:08:07,919
that you have alcohol greens

1978
01:08:05,679 --> 01:08:09,358
vials do you have like hundreds of vials

1979
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:10,079
with different insects in them not

1980
01:08:09,358 --> 01:08:11,838
anymore

1981
01:08:10,079 --> 01:08:13,200
not hundreds what are you gonna do with

1982
01:08:11,838 --> 01:08:15,920
that well so

1983
01:08:13,199 --> 01:08:17,679
i'm gonna take it back and i'm gonna

1984
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:19,520
look at it under a scope

1985
01:08:17,679 --> 01:08:21,199
and i'm gonna look at features sorry

1986
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:22,640
where where was that one from it was a

1987
01:08:21,198 --> 01:08:24,960
selena screenshot

1988
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:26,159
do you need to uh develop a program from

1989
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:28,239
them based on

1990
01:08:26,158 --> 01:08:30,158
that it helps because then you can

1991
01:08:28,238 --> 01:08:30,559
target to the most effective wasps right

1992
01:08:30,158 --> 01:08:33,278
right

1993
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:34,000
right um that that so okay so so by the

1994
01:08:33,279 --> 01:08:37,199

on plant sap and feeds on them

2072
01:11:20,079 --> 01:11:26,719
and wow is a problem in

2073
01:11:23,198 --> 01:11:29,839
some crops citrus has

2074
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:31,600
the um california citrus scales we

2075
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:33,199
have pathogens within them and it looks

2076
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:35,280
like a little know a lot about

2077
01:11:33,198 --> 01:11:36,799
scales you know what it look at this

2078
01:11:35,279 --> 01:11:38,559
photo is gonna look like a raisin does

2079
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:40,159
it look like a turtle shell to you

2080
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:41,920
yeah kind of yeah that's what they look

2081
01:11:40,158 --> 01:11:43,599
like they're little and what is it

2082
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:48,158
it's a it's a soft scale i don't know

2083
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:48,159
which one oh that's the type of insect

2084
01:11:49,119 --> 01:11:52,319
what's like that family common for like

2085
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:55,920
known for

2086
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:58,960
well they'll feed on plant sap right um

2087
01:11:55,920 --> 01:12:00,239
but do they become a problem

2088
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:02,399
you don't know enough yet but that's

2089
01:12:00,238 --> 01:12:02,399
bran

2090
01:12:02,719 --> 01:12:06,158
yes these the adults are the adults can

2091
01:12:04,719 --> 01:12:08,158
fly right

2092
01:12:06,158 --> 01:12:09,839
um the males can fly i believe it is

2093
01:12:08,158 --> 01:12:10,960
mostly but there's they're they're so

2094
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:13,119
small that they'll

2095
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:15,198
be carried on yeah and if there's

2096
01:12:13,119 --> 01:12:17,519
females around then they'll mate and um

2097
01:12:15,198 --> 01:12:20,559
the females will lay eggs

2098
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:22,560
these these often actually these have a

2099
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:24,560
these actually are have keep their eggs

2100
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:26,080
inside of them so if you flip them over

2101
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:27,600
in fact if you had a scope we could do

2102
01:12:26,079 --> 01:12:28,719
it although i think it's fried now

2103
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:31,199
because it's sat in the sun

2104
01:12:28,719 --> 01:12:31,760
yeah but um was it so it was alive

2105
01:12:31,198 --> 01:12:33,119
before

2106
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:35,119
yeah well look at the color difference

2107
01:12:33,119 --> 01:12:36,079
look at the color difference it's this

2108
01:12:35,119 --> 01:12:37,840
was a green leaf

2109
01:12:36,079 --> 01:12:40,238
like half hour ago right yeah that

2110
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:41,760
thing's been big yeah and um

2111
01:12:40,238 --> 01:12:43,439
it's cool it's i probably still have

2112
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:44,880
enough to make some kind of close

2113
01:12:43,439 --> 01:12:48,839
identification of it

2114
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:50,079
um but yeah is it right there uh no it

2115
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:52,480
is

2116
01:12:50,079 --> 01:12:54,000
where'd it go right here oh there it is

2117
01:12:52,479 --> 01:12:56,000
that

2118
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:57,359
yeah it still kind of looks like a like

2119
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:00,800
a a turtle right

2120
01:12:57,359 --> 01:13:03,198
but now it's more shriveled wow yeah

2121
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:04,239
good eye man and so you haven't really

2122
01:13:03,198 --> 01:13:07,119
seen that

2123
01:13:04,238 --> 01:13:08,238
i haven't ever i mean we suspected a

2124
01:13:07,119 --> 01:13:10,158
possible

2125
01:13:08,238 --> 01:13:12,479
this is amazing i suspect they're

2126
01:13:10,158 --> 01:13:12,479
possible

2127
01:13:13,279 --> 01:13:18,079
my my colleagues and i had had a few

2128
01:13:16,719 --> 01:13:21,439
photos that a grower

2129
01:13:18,079 --> 01:13:25,359
sent that we argued was is it scale

2130
01:13:21,439 --> 01:13:27,919
is it is it um a seed a seed

2131
01:13:25,359 --> 01:13:28,479
that that's uh i'm sure if i went to a

2132
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:32,158
scale

2133
01:13:28,479 --> 01:13:34,079
expert they'd be able to id that

2134
01:13:32,158 --> 01:13:35,279
that's that's an okay photo right there

2135
01:13:34,079 --> 01:13:38,158
you can see that's

2136
01:13:35,279 --> 01:13:39,759
that could be this little dot here could

2137
01:13:38,158 --> 01:13:41,519
be where it's uh

2138

01:14:22,719 --> 01:14:26,880
you're rubbing it in now now you're

2159
01:14:24,319 --> 01:14:29,039
rubbing it in you had the scale bug

2160
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:30,640
right yeah which again we don't know if

2161
01:14:29,039 --> 01:14:31,840
this is even a problem right could have

2162
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:33,920
been a confused

2163
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:35,600
but you've never seen it before so not

2164
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:37,199
this no even if it's not causing

2165
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:39,199
problems it's never been seen

2166
01:14:37,198 --> 01:14:41,119
no yeah but we're so new at this right

2167
01:14:39,198 --> 01:14:41,359
i'm sure i'm sure someone else has seen

2168
01:14:41,119 --> 01:14:43,198
it

2169
01:14:41,359 --> 01:14:45,119
oftentimes they'll see it but not be i'm

2170
01:14:43,198 --> 01:14:47,119
just saying like it hasn't been

2171
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:48,800
like if you've never seen it it hasn't

2172
01:14:47,119 --> 01:14:50,238
probably been commonly seen like maybe

2173
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:52,560
one guy's seen it a couple times so that

2174
01:14:50,238 --> 01:14:54,158
bodes well right if if no one's seen it

2175
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:57,440
and you find one

2176
01:14:54,158 --> 01:14:59,039
uh there's uh there's a a bug that is

2177
01:14:57,439 --> 01:15:01,279
particularly like what what's the last

2178
01:14:59,039 --> 01:15:03,439
thing that's kind of been like the uh

2179
01:15:01,279 --> 01:15:04,399
what's the asian wasp like the big

2180
01:15:03,439 --> 01:15:07,519
garbage

2181
01:15:04,399 --> 01:15:11,198
that's what's it called yeah the that

2182
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:11,199
like the killer killer wasabi

2183
01:15:12,479 --> 01:15:16,559
but anyway like something where someone

2184
01:15:14,399 --> 01:15:19,198
saw the first one and then it's like

2185
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:19,760
shit like i guess it would have to be

2186
01:15:19,198 --> 01:15:21,678
you know

2187
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:23,039
most recently was that the cannabis

2188
01:15:21,679 --> 01:15:26,158
aphid you know

2189
01:15:23,039 --> 01:15:29,359
that that blew up uh so i

2190
01:15:26,158 --> 01:15:31,039
i heard about it and again i'm like what

2191
01:15:29,359 --> 01:15:31,599
what was the last year no one talked

2192
01:15:31,039 --> 01:15:34,719
about it

2193
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:35,039
no one talked about it in in salinas

2194
01:15:34,719 --> 01:15:39,039
because

2195
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:42,399
keep in mind tiny area that i worked in

2196
01:15:39,039 --> 01:15:45,600
nobody talked about it um let's see not

2197
01:15:42,399 --> 01:15:48,960
18 we saw it um

2198
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:50,320
17 sometime around 2016. sometime around

2199
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:52,158
2016 nobody was talking about

2200
01:15:50,319 --> 01:15:54,639
and then suddenly like some people were

2201
01:15:52,158 --> 01:15:56,879
talking about no no oregon and colorado

2202
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:59,440
and um it had been described it's not

2203
01:15:56,880 --> 01:16:01,840
like it got discovered on cannabis it

2204
01:15:59,439 --> 01:16:02,559
it um it's a hemp aphid you know it

2205
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:04,880
evolved

2206
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:06,960
on hemp but were oregon growers and

2207
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:08,480
colorado growers seen it even earlier

2208
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:09,679
than 2016.

2209
01:16:08,479 --> 01:16:11,678
you know i don't have to go back and

2210
01:16:09,679 --> 01:16:14,319
sort of notice that i'm not i'm not

2211
01:16:11,679 --> 01:16:15,039
great about exactly when it happened but

2212
01:16:14,319 --> 01:16:18,238
there was

2213
01:16:15,039 --> 01:16:20,238
there was a bulletin sent out by the the

2214
01:16:18,238 --> 01:16:21,919
oregon department of agriculture to all

2215
01:16:20,238 --> 01:16:24,158
the cannabis growers

2216
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:25,039
they legalized a little earlier right um

2217
01:16:24,158 --> 01:16:27,599
they they're

2218
01:16:25,039 --> 01:16:28,479
that hey this is a passive cannabis be

2219
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:32,159
wary of it

2220
01:16:28,479 --> 01:16:34,000
um it it got to salinas like i said the

2221
01:16:32,158 --> 01:16:37,519
first infestation i experienced was

2222
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:39,439
in 2018 we were

2223
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:41,120
at first it was difficult to figure out

2224
01:16:39,439 --> 01:16:42,559
what to do about it

2225
01:16:41,119 --> 01:16:44,640
now we have some strategies how

2226
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:46,640
problematic was it at first was it

2227
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:49,280
destroying whole crops

2228
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:51,280
that's a problem is we never we never

2229
01:16:49,279 --> 01:16:52,079
took the data and that's again i want to

2230
01:16:51,279 --> 01:16:54,238
stress that

2231
01:16:52,079 --> 01:16:55,920
is we really really need the growers to

2232
01:16:54,238 --> 01:16:57,919
get diligent about that

2233
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:59,520
um there was like reporting it yeah

2234
01:16:57,920 --> 01:17:00,480
there was a situation where that first

2235
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:02,640
infestation

2236
01:17:00,479 --> 01:17:04,158
hit me it was about probably an area of

2237
01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:07,360
about 500 square feet

2238
01:17:04,158 --> 01:17:10,000
that it was a mess it was a total mess

2239
01:17:07,359 --> 01:17:11,359
and i begged that we harvested it

2240
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,079
earlier so it wouldn't spread to the

2241
01:17:11,359 --> 01:17:13,679
rest of the crop

2242
01:17:12,079 --> 01:17:15,600
in the end we were able to contain it to

2243
01:17:13,679 --> 01:17:18,719
one area but it was bad

2244
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:19,760
um it was really really bad um where to

2245
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:21,198
the point where

2246
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:23,039
they crawled off of i mean it looked

2247
01:17:21,198 --> 01:17:26,639
like an army crawling off it when it was

2248
01:17:23,039 --> 01:17:29,119
um where it's drying

2249
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:30,560
uh where when we were drying the buds um

2250
01:17:29,119 --> 01:17:32,640
they crawled off

2251
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:33,920
and you know i i that's right right when

2252
01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:37,119
i left harbor side

2253
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:38,719
and i said hey i beg you

2254
01:17:37,119 --> 01:17:41,279
check the potency and yield on this

2255
01:17:38,719 --> 01:17:42,960
please you know but unfortunately nobody

2256
01:17:41,279 --> 01:17:44,880
went that next step and said hey let's

2257
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:46,399
go let's look at what this aphid in this

2258
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:47,920
extreme situation

2259
01:17:46,399 --> 01:17:49,920
did to this bud i mean we're not going

2260
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:51,520
to know what it what potential it had

2261
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:53,039
you mean did well that's what i was

2262
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:53,360
going to say was there a baseline of

2263
01:17:53,039 --> 01:17:55,359
like

2264
01:17:53,359 --> 01:17:57,679
no but you could rest itself this

2265
01:17:55,359 --> 01:17:59,599
amazingly last

2266
01:17:57,679 --> 01:18:01,520
where's that you could you could compare

2267
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:03,600
it to the rest of that crop in that and

2268
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:05,440
the different maybe there was a the same

2269
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:06,320
exact strain in the same exact

2270
01:18:05,439 --> 01:18:08,960
greenhouse

2271
01:18:06,319 --> 01:18:10,238
but in another corner it's like years

2272
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:11,760
and wine grapes right

2273
01:18:10,238 --> 01:18:14,479
like there are certain years that are

2274
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:16,400
like yeah exceptional years and the

2275
01:18:14,479 --> 01:18:18,799
bottles reflect that in their price

2276
01:18:16,399 --> 01:18:20,000
yeah some some like that i guess yeah so

2277
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:21,119
but you know that would have been a

2278
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:24,000
great one where

2279
01:18:21,119 --> 01:18:26,079
okay take good record of the yield of

2280
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:27,679
that particular strain

2281
01:18:26,079 --> 01:18:30,000
and then do it again the next time you

2282
01:18:27,679 --> 01:18:32,158
grow that strain and then do it once

2283
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:34,079
you know keep them under you know keep

2284
01:18:32,158 --> 01:18:34,960
them from being attacked maybe put

2285
01:18:34,079 --> 01:18:38,719
special

2286
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:39,600
special um you know more resources into

2287
01:18:38,719 --> 01:18:42,640
keeping

2288
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:44,560
that strain from being attacked and then

2289
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:46,159
now grow on where you have okay i had a

2290
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:48,080
successful crop with it here

2291
01:18:46,158 --> 01:18:49,759
and compare your yields per square foot

2292
01:18:48,079 --> 01:18:53,279
and compare your potency

2293
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:56,960
in the flower and then if you found

2294
01:18:53,279 --> 01:18:59,759
a drop in one percent yield

2295
01:18:56,960 --> 01:19:01,198
and half of a percent of potency was it

2296
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:04,480
a problem

2297
01:19:01,198 --> 01:19:06,479
it looked ugly right and yeah it made it

2298
01:19:04,479 --> 01:19:08,158
stick around in your garden in your grow

2299
01:19:06,479 --> 01:19:09,359
and it moved to other crops so yeah

2300
01:19:08,158 --> 01:19:11,920
that's a problem

2301
01:19:09,359 --> 01:19:13,119
but how problematic is it really how

2302
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:15,440
damaging is it's just

2303
01:19:13,119 --> 01:19:17,279
really early although at a certain point

2304
01:19:15,439 --> 01:19:19,198
you know we know in other crops

2305
01:19:17,279 --> 01:19:20,719
aphid infestations when when you see a

2306
01:19:19,198 --> 01:19:21,439
plant covered with aphid that can't be

2307
01:19:20,719 --> 01:19:24,319
good

2308
01:19:21,439 --> 01:19:25,678
right but how many are tolerable right

2309
01:19:24,319 --> 01:19:26,719
we just don't we just don't know the

2310
01:19:25,679 --> 01:19:29,920
resources

2311
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:33,840
what is that the point of like some

2312
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:36,800
pests is good lots like of a species

2313
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:38,560
like having a couple aphids like

2314
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:40,239
i wouldn't use good but like not

2315
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:41,600
negative let's put it this way and then

2316
01:19:40,238 --> 01:19:44,479
like but having a ton

2317
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:46,000
is obviously the nature's typically

2318
01:19:44,479 --> 01:19:49,119
balanced right you don't see

2319
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:51,760
massive infestations you know well

2320
01:19:49,119 --> 01:19:53,359
unless like somehow humans might have

2321
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:54,640
been you know interfered but you do see

2322
01:19:53,359 --> 01:19:56,639
them on occasion but

2323
01:19:54,640 --> 01:19:57,679
nature balances itself right populations

2324
01:19:56,640 --> 01:19:59,920
of predators

2325
01:19:57,679 --> 01:20:01,119
climb with the populations of the pests

2326
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:03,440
pest populations drop

2327
01:20:01,119 --> 01:20:05,599
off populations of predators drop off

2328
01:20:03,439 --> 01:20:06,319
it's a sign it's like my compost bin

2329
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:09,120
where like

2330
01:20:06,319 --> 01:20:10,799
there's a food source outside my house

2331
01:20:09,119 --> 01:20:13,920
where there never had been one

2332
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:15,760
and now black soldier flies are like

2333
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:17,840
and they're larva i mean it's like

2334
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:21,039
millions of or not millions but like

2335
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:22,480
hundreds of them in in like in my worm

2336
01:20:21,039 --> 01:20:24,238
bin they're in there too the worms

2337
01:20:22,479 --> 01:20:26,000
aren't very they're just like

2338
01:20:24,238 --> 01:20:27,759
i love those guys i gotta tell you i

2339
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:29,439
gotta tell you a story sometime about

2340
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:30,960
those because i was i was planning about

2341
01:20:29,439 --> 01:20:32,000
worms or black soldier flies surge of

2342
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:35,359
fry larva yeah

2343
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:37,520
and cannabis i love them but they keep

2344
01:20:35,359 --> 01:20:39,759
the the larva keep finding their way

2345
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:40,639
under the the floorboards into the house

2346
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:43,440
and so

2347
01:20:40,639 --> 01:20:44,480
my wife sees like these larva crawling

2348
01:20:43,439 --> 01:20:46,559
across the floor

2349
01:20:44,479 --> 01:20:48,238
and that is i was i was growing them

2350
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:50,320
indoors myself and i would

2351
01:20:48,238 --> 01:20:52,319
like when i see them i'm like sweet like

2352
01:20:50,319 --> 01:20:54,799
let me release you outside yeah

2353
01:20:52,319 --> 01:20:55,920
that's cool do your job and she's like

2354
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:57,760
the fuck but yeah

2355
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:58,960
it's it's like that's something's gonna

2356
01:20:57,760 --> 01:21:01,199
come you plant something

2357
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:02,880
something's going to come and you know

2358
01:21:01,198 --> 01:21:04,079
we've you've made something artificial

2359
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:06,639
here right

2360
01:21:04,079 --> 01:21:09,198
um some of the pests it's less

2361
01:21:06,639 --> 01:21:12,000
artificial than just the grass though

2362
01:21:09,198 --> 01:21:14,719
it is yeah it's getting back to but

2363
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:16,800
you've brought a a non-native plant

2364
01:21:14,719 --> 01:21:18,000
into this environment it's true and who

2365
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:20,480
was here waiting

2366
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:21,279
corneirwin was here waiting susceptible

2367
01:21:20,479 --> 01:21:23,519
all the native

2368
01:21:21,279 --> 01:21:24,559
pests that have been waiting for worm

2369
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:26,320
was probably

2370
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:28,639
around here for since you bought the

2371
01:21:26,319 --> 01:21:30,399
house you know it's been here forever

2372
01:21:28,639 --> 01:21:32,560
where has it been feeding i don't know

2373
01:21:30,399 --> 01:21:36,319
maybe your neighbor has some corn or

2374
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:39,199
uh oh does it love corn yeah okay

2375
01:21:36,319 --> 01:21:40,799
yeah they're critical it actually likes

2376
01:21:39,198 --> 01:21:43,678
corn ears

2377
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:45,119
ah interesting yeah so it focuses

2378
01:21:43,679 --> 01:21:45,920
specifically would the ear be the

2379
01:21:45,119 --> 01:21:49,599
outside part

2380
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:51,440
no the ears uh is the actual kernels so

2381
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:54,079
it'll it'll do the same thing it'll

2382
01:21:51,439 --> 01:21:54,719
go inside it'll go into the the court

2383
01:21:54,079 --> 01:21:55,920
like yeah

2384
01:21:54,719 --> 01:21:57,439
i'll tell you what go to your farmer's

2385
01:21:55,920 --> 01:21:59,119
market if there's anyone here that grows

2386
01:21:57,439 --> 01:22:04,079
corn locally

2387
01:21:59,119 --> 01:22:04,079
you know that bacillus thuringiensis

2388
01:22:04,719 --> 01:22:11,359
is that bacteria i told you about one of

2389
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:14,719
the first successful monsanto gmos

2390
01:22:11,359 --> 01:22:15,119
they they took corn and and inserted the

2391
01:22:14,719 --> 01:22:17,198
gene

2392
01:22:15,119 --> 01:22:19,519
of the bacillus thuringiensis into the

2393
01:22:17,198 --> 01:22:21,919
corn so the corn naturally produces the

2394
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:22,960
bt toxin and when the corn earworm feeds

2395
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:25,840
on it

2396
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:26,880
it dies the corn is poisonous to it but

2397
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:28,319
not to us

2398
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:30,239
but anything we know that it's about to

2399
01:22:28,319 --> 01:22:33,679
eat poison potentially

2400
01:22:30,238 --> 01:22:36,399
that's exactly what monsanto will yeah

2401
01:22:33,679 --> 01:22:39,279
yeah like it starts munching on the buds

2402
01:22:36,399 --> 01:22:39,279
if you make a bt

2403
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:43,760
make a bt cannabis and then you you you

2404
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:47,039
if it's a ct

2405
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:49,280
short for a bacillus thuringiensis

2406
01:22:47,039 --> 01:22:50,238
so and they've done it for corn and

2407
01:22:49,279 --> 01:22:52,559
guess what in

2408
01:22:50,238 --> 01:22:53,439
it made the difference between people in

2409
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:55,600
africa

2410
01:22:53,439 --> 01:22:56,960
you know having something to eat having

2411
01:22:55,600 --> 01:23:00,480
crops and not

2412
01:22:56,960 --> 01:23:04,639
you know oh yeah but it's it's a

2413
01:23:00,479 --> 01:23:06,000
around here but but on that front of tom

2414
01:23:04,639 --> 01:23:09,119
what if you grow some bt

2415
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:11,039
corn out here yeah around the corner

2416
01:23:09,119 --> 01:23:13,119
ah as like uh what do you call it a

2417
01:23:11,039 --> 01:23:14,960
banker plan

2418
01:23:13,119 --> 01:23:17,559
right yeah yeah see what i'm getting

2419
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:21,039
that would be the power move some

2420
01:23:17,560 --> 01:23:23,920
monsanto corn yeah on the perimeter

2421
01:23:21,039 --> 01:23:25,198
yeah not to even eat just for it's it is

2422
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:27,039
keep in mind it it

2423
01:23:25,198 --> 01:23:29,039
it evolved we think it evolved on

2424
01:23:27,039 --> 01:23:30,639
grasses

2425
01:23:29,039 --> 01:23:35,840
gross put some not to grow out here

2426
01:23:30,639 --> 01:23:35,840
because these same caterpillars

2427
01:23:36,238 --> 01:23:39,519
you just couldn't like breed and then

2428
01:23:38,399 --> 01:23:41,279
sell them to other people

2429
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:42,880
or use them grow it actually that's the

2430
01:23:41,279 --> 01:23:45,198
phrase the moss

2431
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:46,719
will fly to it lay its eggs on it as

2432
01:23:45,198 --> 01:23:48,559
soon as the caterpillar hatches and

2433
01:23:46,719 --> 01:23:50,560
starts feeding

2434
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:52,719
and it doesn't move into your crop it's

2435
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:54,639
possible that cornier worm moth

2436
01:23:52,719 --> 01:23:57,359
likes the smell of corn better than

2437
01:23:54,639 --> 01:24:00,079
cannabis so maybe more moths will go

2438
01:23:57,359 --> 01:24:00,719
who would i mean that doesn't i mean

2439
01:24:00,079 --> 01:24:04,238
they were

2440
01:24:00,719 --> 01:24:05,760
so pungent you know they were amazing

2441
01:24:04,238 --> 01:24:07,439
they're still playing they had huge

2442
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:10,159
potential but but

2443
01:24:07,439 --> 01:24:12,879
but gmo crops that's uh i don't know

2444
01:24:10,158 --> 01:24:14,799
that's not really sexy in cannabis right

2445
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:16,319
but but it's interesting to have it as

2446
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:17,600
the trap plant

2447
01:24:16,319 --> 01:24:19,359
yeah you have to be like i'm not even

2448
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:21,600
going to eat the corn yeah there are

2449
01:24:19,359 --> 01:24:23,439
other bt crops out there too

2450
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:26,159
you know again i don't want to be well

2451
01:24:23,439 --> 01:24:29,039
gmo cannabis is an inevitability

2452
01:24:26,158 --> 01:24:31,920
you know heck it could be you know but

2453
01:24:29,039 --> 01:24:33,519
not in tom's backyard

2454
01:24:31,920 --> 01:24:35,279
no but you know there's genetic

2455
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:38,639
modifications that are not

2456
01:24:35,279 --> 01:24:40,559
tom may be rethinking that remember

2457
01:24:38,639 --> 01:24:42,159
remember that there is more than just

2458
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:43,360
outdoor growing cannabis you have

2459
01:24:42,158 --> 01:24:46,399
greenhouse and indoor

2460
01:24:43,359 --> 01:24:47,359
cannabis and typically they have that

2461
01:24:46,399 --> 01:24:50,559
extra

2462
01:24:47,359 --> 01:24:51,599
protection of exclusions so they have

2463
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:53,120
screening

2464
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:55,520
the question is is there are there

2465
01:24:53,119 --> 01:24:56,158
unintended consequences to making the bt

2466
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:58,080
corn

2467
01:24:56,158 --> 01:25:00,479
that oh yeah they're gonna be very yeah

2468
01:24:58,079 --> 01:25:03,119
they're we don't know for sure yet but

2469
01:25:00,479 --> 01:25:03,519
there there can be you know that that

2470
01:25:03,119 --> 01:25:05,840
that

2471
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:06,639
yeah you're making it resistant to these

2472
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:08,719
you know

2473
01:25:06,639 --> 01:25:10,079
to these disease to these diseases and

2474
01:25:08,719 --> 01:25:12,158
this this predator

2475
01:25:10,079 --> 01:25:13,760
but you know what's the trade-off are

2476
01:25:12,158 --> 01:25:15,599
you killing there's a lot of trade-offs

2477
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:18,560
nutrients

2478
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:19,280
and what it does to your body well we

2479
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:21,360
don't know that

2480
01:25:19,279 --> 01:25:23,039
yet but you know imagine you've you've

2481
01:25:21,359 --> 01:25:25,839
heard these stories right a farmer down

2482
01:25:23,039 --> 01:25:28,719
the road from a monsanto farmer

2483
01:25:25,840 --> 01:25:29,440
pollinated and then it's the fucking

2484
01:25:28,719 --> 01:25:31,840
like

2485
01:25:29,439 --> 01:25:33,119
his fault it's the wind's fault and he

2486
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:35,039
can't use his seed

2487
01:25:33,119 --> 01:25:37,359
there are no laws i guess between from

2488
01:25:35,039 --> 01:25:40,880
pollen flying from one farm to another

2489
01:25:37,359 --> 01:25:41,839
so you trespassed onto my property and

2490
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:43,760
now i have to pay you

2491
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:45,440
you stole yeah i have to pay you now i

2492
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:48,639
can't use my own seed

2493
01:25:45,439 --> 01:25:51,359
you know but you know

2494
01:25:48,639 --> 01:25:52,000
it's it's it's all handled in the in the

2495
01:25:51,359 --> 01:25:53,359
courts and

2496
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:55,039
if you've got the money you've got the

2497
01:25:53,359 --> 01:25:58,238
lawyers

2498
01:25:55,039 --> 01:26:00,639
yeah yeah i think that was monsanto's

2499
01:25:58,238 --> 01:26:02,638
strategy just to bulldoze legally

2500
01:26:00,639 --> 01:26:03,920
yeah so there are those and then and

2501
01:26:02,639 --> 01:26:04,480
then you know you could you could

2502
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:06,960
consider

2503
01:26:04,479 --> 01:26:09,119
you know corn has wild relatives out

2504
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:10,399
there and if then if you

2505
01:26:09,119 --> 01:26:12,559
you know if there was some kind of

2506
01:26:10,399 --> 01:26:14,000
cross-pollination with a wild relative i

2507
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:16,639
mean that's possible

2508
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:18,880
now you created this wild plant that

2509
01:26:16,639 --> 01:26:20,800
with that defense that is protected from

2510
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:22,400
caterpillars and then

2511
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:24,719
what happens with that can it now

2512
01:26:22,399 --> 01:26:25,359
dominate and out compete other plants in

2513
01:26:24,719 --> 01:26:29,359
the same

2514
01:26:25,359 --> 01:26:33,359
you know yeah corn abyss corn abuse

2515
01:26:29,359 --> 01:26:33,359
it's a crop yeah fuzzy bear

2516
01:26:33,439 --> 01:26:38,158
i don't know it's a it's a topic it's a

2517
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:41,760
it's fun to talk about it but

2518
01:26:38,158 --> 01:26:44,960
um yeah you'd have this wild uh

2519
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:48,320
mutant gene that's like

2520
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:51,439
sees its path to like total freedom by

2521
01:26:48,319 --> 01:26:53,519
not being controlled right so right

2522
01:26:51,439 --> 01:26:55,919
yeah exactly but again you know like i

2523
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:59,199
said uh ear

2524
01:26:55,920 --> 01:27:01,039
caterpillars are are a problem usually

2525
01:26:59,198 --> 01:27:02,879
an outdoor cannabis and then

2526
01:27:01,039 --> 01:27:04,158
the next would be in greenhouse you

2527
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:05,840
could get pro you can have

2528
01:27:04,158 --> 01:27:07,599
problems tom's going to move into that

2529
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:10,560
well we are going to maybe this is our

2530
01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:12,800
inspiration to finally set up the uh

2531
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:14,000
the yeah well yeah they're they're tough

2532
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:15,679
to battle

2533
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:17,198
but the strategy is once again

2534
01:27:15,679 --> 01:27:20,239
monitoring and

2535
01:27:17,198 --> 01:27:22,319
and acting early you know as soon as you

2536
01:27:20,238 --> 01:27:24,799
have any hint that it's time to act

2537
01:27:22,319 --> 01:27:25,599
with these guys with these with these

2538
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:28,639
bugs

2539
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:29,360
then then act you know start your bt

2540
01:27:28,639 --> 01:27:34,159
sprays

2541
01:27:29,359 --> 01:27:37,439
um start uh this is hemp right

2542
01:27:34,158 --> 01:27:39,039
no no this can't this is high thc

2543
01:27:37,439 --> 01:27:40,479
is it oh okay for some reason i thought

2544
01:27:39,039 --> 01:27:42,719
you said it was this high cbd

2545
01:27:40,479 --> 01:27:45,198
why not start all right this one's like

2546
01:27:42,719 --> 01:27:48,000
right down the middle

2547
01:27:45,198 --> 01:27:49,359
the autos are actually you're selling it

2548
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:51,198
as thc cannabis

2549
01:27:49,359 --> 01:27:52,479
or i mean you're growing it fresh yeah

2550
01:27:51,198 --> 01:27:53,839
if you were growing it commercially

2551
01:27:52,479 --> 01:27:57,039
you'd be selling it as th

2552
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:58,639
as yeah right right so so yeah because i

2553
01:27:57,039 --> 01:28:00,158
was gonna say in hemp i'm not

2554
01:27:58,639 --> 01:28:01,520
i'm not as aware of the laws but then

2555
01:28:00,158 --> 01:28:03,198
you still have that other weapon that

2556
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:05,199
that spin assad i told you about i

2557
01:28:03,198 --> 01:28:06,638
i'm not sure if that's legal in hemp

2558
01:28:05,198 --> 01:28:09,039
still i know it's not good

2559
01:28:06,639 --> 01:28:10,560
if not in cannabis but in hemp it might

2560
01:28:09,039 --> 01:28:12,639
be so you have another weapon

2561
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:13,760
and you got your sprays start your wasp

2562
01:28:12,639 --> 01:28:15,679
releases early

2563
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:16,960
they're really not that expensive you

2564
01:28:15,679 --> 01:28:18,079
know just we

2565
01:28:16,960 --> 01:28:19,600
you know we recommend a certain

2566
01:28:18,079 --> 01:28:20,238
frequency and a certain amount some

2567
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:21,520
growers say

2568
01:28:20,238 --> 01:28:23,519
i'm going to double the frequency and

2569
01:28:21,520 --> 01:28:24,960
i'm going to triple the amount

2570
01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:27,280
that's how bad i want to protect and

2571
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:28,000
that's how that's the kind of investment

2572
01:28:27,279 --> 01:28:30,880
i want to make to

2573
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:32,479
to just have one more weapon uh to throw

2574
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:33,600
at them well you deal mostly with

2575
01:28:32,479 --> 01:28:36,959
obviously with with

2576
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:38,560
commercial drugs um but obviously

2577
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:41,439
everything would be less

2578
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:42,239
i mean oh yeah for just a little growth

2579
01:28:41,439 --> 01:28:43,759
so our

2580
01:28:42,238 --> 01:28:45,759
the smallest container we sell the

2581
01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:48,480
trigger grandma wash is going to be

2582
01:28:45,760 --> 01:28:49,199
you know ten fold more than more than

2583
01:28:48,479 --> 01:28:51,919
for that yeah

2584
01:28:49,198 --> 01:28:55,039
right so how much so what does that cost

2585
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:57,319
oh i'd have to dig into it

2586
01:28:55,039 --> 01:28:58,800
um well go go to our website um

2587
01:28:57,319 --> 01:29:00,079
greenmethods.com and

2588
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:02,079
and that's cool that's kind of the

2589
01:29:00,079 --> 01:29:02,960
retail that's our retail website so you

2590
01:29:02,079 --> 01:29:04,559
can see what that

2591
01:29:02,960 --> 01:29:06,239
but of course if you're commercial then

2592
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:08,960
there's hundreds of dollars oh

2593
01:29:06,238 --> 01:29:10,158
i mean no they're you know we rear them

2594
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:12,399
ourselves

2595
01:29:10,158 --> 01:29:13,519
uh you know we're yeah they're not

2596
01:29:12,399 --> 01:29:15,359
they're not that expensive

2597
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:16,800
it's it's totally worth it let's put it

2598
01:29:15,359 --> 01:29:19,439
that way for prevention it's

2599
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:20,480
i mean you can see this i go through

2600
01:29:19,439 --> 01:29:22,319
count

2601
01:29:20,479 --> 01:29:23,839
cut your heart i would if you're gonna

2602
01:29:22,319 --> 01:29:24,639
harvest this for oils or whatever you're

2603
01:29:23,840 --> 01:29:26,880
gonna do with it

2604
01:29:24,639 --> 01:29:28,319
but take the time to to give them to

2605
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:31,039
your to your daughter and

2606
01:29:28,319 --> 01:29:32,880
and have her go through every one and

2607
01:29:31,039 --> 01:29:33,840
and see how many of them have the turds

2608
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:37,039
in them because

2609
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:37,600
i i saw i don't think i saw one that

2610
01:29:37,039 --> 01:29:40,719
didn't

2611
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:42,800
it seems like they all hit you and um

2612
01:29:40,719 --> 01:29:44,239
you know it's and it could just be the

2613
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:47,360
drying of the of the

2614
01:29:44,238 --> 01:29:49,039
the chewed up bud too you know it's

2615
01:29:47,359 --> 01:29:52,238
yeah so it's well worth it look at look

2616
01:29:49,039 --> 01:29:52,238
for other caterpillars

2617
01:29:52,399 --> 01:29:55,759
i mean the question is then also where's

2618
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:58,079
it where are all the caterpillars

2619
01:29:55,760 --> 01:29:59,199
or the question or could one caterpillar

2620
01:29:58,079 --> 01:30:01,840
i bet if we started

2621
01:29:59,198 --> 01:30:02,238
digging in there can they they can they

2622
01:30:01,840 --> 01:30:04,159
can

2623
01:30:02,238 --> 01:30:05,279
but normally they don't move like they

2624
01:30:04,158 --> 01:30:07,039
don't move they kind of like

2625
01:30:05,279 --> 01:30:08,399
yeah but this could have been any number

2626
01:30:07,039 --> 01:30:11,439
of events i mean i

2627
01:30:08,399 --> 01:30:14,559
i did not see classic botrytis

2628
01:30:11,439 --> 01:30:16,960
you know mycelia you know the the

2629
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:17,600
hyphy i didn't see it so you know i'm

2630
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:19,679
still like

2631
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:21,280
what what what the hell it's dry so does

2632
01:30:19,679 --> 01:30:23,679
that mean that potentially it's not

2633
01:30:21,279 --> 01:30:25,759
betrayed us at all you know it looks a

2634
01:30:23,679 --> 01:30:27,760
lot it looks like botrytis

2635
01:30:25,760 --> 01:30:29,679
um it looks like that end stage of

2636
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:31,520
botrytis i was in here

2637
01:30:29,679 --> 01:30:32,719
you know a few weeks a week ago to see

2638
01:30:31,520 --> 01:30:37,600
what it was like but

2639
01:30:32,719 --> 01:30:41,600
but uh yeah i broke up

2640
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:43,840
yeah yeah the um

2641
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:43,840
see

2642
01:30:45,198 --> 01:30:52,000
yeah there's some gray there

2643
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:53,840
it's tough i am i've seen a lot of

2644
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:56,880
botrytis but this is

2645
01:30:53,840 --> 01:30:58,159
this is odd so but yeah look for more

2646
01:30:56,880 --> 01:31:01,199
caterpillars

2647
01:30:58,158 --> 01:31:03,039
just find as many as you can and

2648
01:31:01,198 --> 01:31:05,039
send them my way or i can pick them up

2649
01:31:03,039 --> 01:31:08,479
when i'm out here again

2650
01:31:05,039 --> 01:31:09,600
um so you live in l.a yeah i live in

2651
01:31:08,479 --> 01:31:12,879
palms just

2652
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:15,039
north of culver city yeah so i

2653
01:31:12,880 --> 01:31:17,199
i have a few growers out here in the

2654
01:31:15,039 --> 01:31:19,760
valley i was just here last week

2655
01:31:17,198 --> 01:31:20,238
or the week before visiting some of you

2656
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:22,800
guys

2657
01:31:20,238 --> 01:31:24,559
indoor guys yeah yeah and what do they

2658
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:28,000
have to deal with

2659
01:31:24,560 --> 01:31:31,039
well indoor and greenhouse pet pest

2660
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:31,679
complex is a lot more it's a lot more

2661
01:31:31,039 --> 01:31:34,960
similar

2662
01:31:31,679 --> 01:31:38,319
um indoor guys have a really

2663
01:31:34,960 --> 01:31:40,960
a harder time with rude aphid than than

2664
01:31:38,319 --> 01:31:42,399
maybe the greenhouse ones do and then

2665
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:44,639
outdoor guys have

2666
01:31:42,399 --> 01:31:46,158
very little problem with rude aphid so

2667
01:31:44,639 --> 01:31:47,359
it seems to be like the opposite with

2668
01:31:46,158 --> 01:31:50,079
the caterpillar right

2669
01:31:47,359 --> 01:31:51,359
with the that you get a lot of indoor

2670
01:31:50,079 --> 01:31:52,479
growers that are saying i can't get rid

2671
01:31:51,359 --> 01:31:54,399
of these root aphid

2672
01:31:52,479 --> 01:31:55,519
whereas in greenhouses you might have

2673
01:31:54,399 --> 01:31:57,519
easier control and then

2674
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:58,960
outdoors are rarely a problem i've not

2675
01:31:57,520 --> 01:32:00,960
heard of a problem

2676
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:02,560
outdoors usually what happens is an

2677
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:04,158
infested plant if it gets

2678
01:32:02,560 --> 01:32:06,239
if it's got them in the pot and it gets

2679
01:32:04,158 --> 01:32:09,198
transplanted to the soil

2680
01:32:06,238 --> 01:32:11,039
they'll that'll end that'll often end

2681
01:32:09,198 --> 01:32:13,359
the infestation of root aphid

2682
01:32:11,039 --> 01:32:14,479
just transplanting outdoors you know so

2683
01:32:13,359 --> 01:32:16,319
it's like

2684
01:32:14,479 --> 01:32:17,839
um it's a different environment that's

2685
01:32:16,319 --> 01:32:19,920
interesting so people who are like

2686
01:32:17,840 --> 01:32:21,679
propagating in greenhouses for outdoor

2687
01:32:19,920 --> 01:32:23,920
grows they could have root aphids in the

2688
01:32:21,679 --> 01:32:27,039
indoor part and then bring them out and

2689
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:29,920
it's been seen before and we have

2690
01:32:27,039 --> 01:32:30,479
hypotheses on why that's the case you

2691
01:32:29,920 --> 01:32:31,840
know so

2692
01:32:30,479 --> 01:32:33,919
well that's a clue right there there's

2693
01:32:31,840 --> 01:32:36,319
something in that indoor environment

2694
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:37,039
that is conducive that the root aphid

2695
01:32:36,319 --> 01:32:39,759
likes

2696
01:32:37,039 --> 01:32:40,319
i tend to think more so my my hypothesis

2697
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:43,920
is

2698
01:32:40,319 --> 01:32:44,719
um those are not very good diggers the

2699
01:32:43,920 --> 01:32:47,520
aphids are

2700
01:32:44,719 --> 01:32:48,399
root aphid it's rice root aphid actually

2701
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:52,159
came from rice

2702
01:32:48,399 --> 01:32:53,679
um it was a pest of rice let's say

2703
01:32:52,158 --> 01:32:55,198
that's how it was identified so it was

2704
01:32:53,679 --> 01:32:58,239
called rice root aphid

2705
01:32:55,198 --> 01:33:01,279
but it does like so this is a

2706
01:32:58,238 --> 01:33:04,158
it jumps plant species too yeah

2707
01:33:01,279 --> 01:33:05,198
i know it's a problem in you know the

2708
01:33:04,158 --> 01:33:07,920
the monocots

2709
01:33:05,198 --> 01:33:08,399
like the grasses rice being one of them

2710
01:33:07,920 --> 01:33:10,480
so

2711
01:33:08,399 --> 01:33:12,479
would it be a problem with corn i don't

2712
01:33:10,479 --> 01:33:14,158
know but i know it's also a problem

2713
01:33:12,479 --> 01:33:16,079
in broadleaf because i know it's a

2714
01:33:14,158 --> 01:33:19,039
problem in

2715
01:33:16,079 --> 01:33:20,479
salinas celery right the same exact

2716
01:33:19,039 --> 01:33:24,000
aphid and we know that it

2717
01:33:20,479 --> 01:33:27,039
it effects it infests uh cannabis but

2718
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:29,039
what i was getting to is is i don't i

2719
01:33:27,039 --> 01:33:30,639
mean i'd like more data on this but

2720
01:33:29,039 --> 01:33:32,399
i've done a lot of this where you know

2721
01:33:30,639 --> 01:33:34,960
found infested pots of aphid

2722
01:33:32,399 --> 01:33:36,158
and then after harvest cut the cut the

2723
01:33:34,960 --> 01:33:38,480
um

2724
01:33:36,158 --> 01:33:39,679
the root ball in half and looked for

2725
01:33:38,479 --> 01:33:43,599
them and they weren't

2726
01:33:39,679 --> 01:33:46,800
in inside the pot they were populating

2727
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:50,239
that space between the soil

2728
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:50,560
and the pot that that which makes it

2729
01:33:50,238 --> 01:33:53,198
that

2730
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:54,000
that border there which makes it a lot

2731
01:33:53,198 --> 01:33:56,559
easier with

2732
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:58,158
all those spaces and caverns in there

2733
01:33:56,560 --> 01:34:00,480
for them to move around

2734
01:33:58,158 --> 01:34:02,559
and for them to find roots so that's

2735
01:34:00,479 --> 01:34:04,799
their optimal place to hang out

2736
01:34:02,560 --> 01:34:06,880
once yeah if you notice indoor gorgeous

2737
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:08,880
doors rockwool growers

2738
01:34:06,880 --> 01:34:09,920
you know the the rockwell cubes are

2739
01:34:08,880 --> 01:34:11,279
wrapped

2740
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:13,520
guess where they are they're in between

2741
01:34:11,279 --> 01:34:15,279
that plastic and they might have gone

2742
01:34:13,520 --> 01:34:17,120
into you know the rockwool's just like

2743
01:34:15,279 --> 01:34:20,000
fiberglass right it's a bunch of

2744
01:34:17,119 --> 01:34:21,760
laminate you know of just layers of

2745
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:23,520
where they can feed on the roots

2746
01:34:21,760 --> 01:34:25,760
yeah they feed it on the roots yeah they

2747
01:34:23,520 --> 01:34:28,480
can get into some of those little

2748
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:30,079
those little crevices too so but so

2749
01:34:28,479 --> 01:34:32,638
hydro growers deal with them too

2750
01:34:30,079 --> 01:34:33,439
hydro growers deal with them too um i i

2751
01:34:32,639 --> 01:34:36,480
often say

2752
01:34:33,439 --> 01:34:39,759
um like

2753
01:34:36,479 --> 01:34:41,678
soil is probably the best because um

2754
01:34:39,760 --> 01:34:43,679
like like i would be hard-pressed to

2755
01:34:41,679 --> 01:34:46,960
think that you're ever gonna find

2756
01:34:43,679 --> 01:34:49,118
your root aphid become a problem in that

2757
01:34:46,960 --> 01:34:51,198
setup because

2758
01:34:49,118 --> 01:34:52,238
they have to they don't dig well like i

2759
01:34:51,198 --> 01:34:57,118
said they can

2760
01:34:52,238 --> 01:34:59,198
they can move in those cracks

2761
01:34:57,118 --> 01:35:01,118
to get to the roots well roots are a

2762
01:34:59,198 --> 01:35:02,638
little bit farther away from the walls

2763
01:35:01,118 --> 01:35:05,039
and by the time the roots do get to the

2764
01:35:02,639 --> 01:35:08,400
walls of the of those pots there

2765
01:35:05,039 --> 01:35:09,039
i mean that plant might be large enough

2766
01:35:08,399 --> 01:35:11,359
to yeah

2767
01:35:09,039 --> 01:35:12,319
where it's not a problem yeah so the the

2768
01:35:11,359 --> 01:35:15,039
environment

2769
01:35:12,319 --> 01:35:15,840
really defines where the vulnerabilities

2770
01:35:15,039 --> 01:35:18,158
are it could

2771
01:35:15,840 --> 01:35:20,480
yeah it could tom i remember this same

2772
01:35:18,158 --> 01:35:21,759
view two weeks ago was beautiful and

2773
01:35:20,479 --> 01:35:24,399
epic

2774
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:25,119
of these lush plants and and you know

2775
01:35:24,399 --> 01:35:28,158
what that's

2776
01:35:25,118 --> 01:35:30,479
actually i mean hate to learn from this

2777
01:35:28,158 --> 01:35:32,719
experience but

2778
01:35:30,479 --> 01:35:33,839
how long really was that two weeks ago

2779
01:35:32,719 --> 01:35:35,600
you said yeah

2780
01:35:33,840 --> 01:35:39,119
what if you'd cut what would your yield

2781
01:35:35,600 --> 01:35:39,119
have been if you'd cut last weekend

2782
01:35:40,639 --> 01:35:44,719
double what you have now right so it's

2783
01:35:43,600 --> 01:35:46,639
it's a lesson for

2784
01:35:44,719 --> 01:35:48,000
some growers i mean most growers they

2785
01:35:46,639 --> 01:35:49,039
they're aware of this as soon as they

2786
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,479
see

2787
01:35:49,039 --> 01:35:52,079
one flower they're they're in their

2788
01:35:50,479 --> 01:35:54,638
cutting um

2789
01:35:52,079 --> 01:35:56,479
lesson is if if this was botrytis it

2790
01:35:54,639 --> 01:36:00,159
looks like it and

2791
01:35:56,479 --> 01:36:02,799
um you know it

2792
01:36:00,158 --> 01:36:03,839
it may be i always used to say salinas

2793
01:36:02,800 --> 01:36:05,920
is a hard place

2794
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:08,079
to grow cannabis if you don't have good

2795
01:36:05,920 --> 01:36:11,359
good environmental control

2796
01:36:08,079 --> 01:36:13,198
and i'll just say if you know without

2797
01:36:11,359 --> 01:36:14,639
the the good environmental control we

2798
01:36:13,198 --> 01:36:15,439
don't call the harvest but try this

2799
01:36:14,639 --> 01:36:17,760
cause a harvest

2800
01:36:15,439 --> 01:36:18,799
right it's the one that decides you

2801
01:36:17,760 --> 01:36:21,119
either pick me

2802
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:23,119
you either harvest me now or i will lose

2803
01:36:21,118 --> 01:36:26,719
everything or i'll take it all

2804
01:36:23,118 --> 01:36:28,000
right so and you know sometimes growers

2805
01:36:26,719 --> 01:36:30,399
that's tough to do you've gone through

2806
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,880
the whole life and then the last week or

2807
01:36:30,399 --> 01:36:33,039
two

2808
01:36:30,880 --> 01:36:33,920
is when this starts up and you're like

2809
01:36:33,039 --> 01:36:36,079
what the hell and

2810
01:36:33,920 --> 01:36:37,520
at that point it's smartest thing we did

2811
01:36:36,079 --> 01:36:38,719
once when we did have a little problem

2812
01:36:37,520 --> 01:36:41,920
was

2813
01:36:38,719 --> 01:36:44,960
was harvest early and send that out

2814
01:36:41,920 --> 01:36:46,800
fresh frozen to live resin and yeah the

2815
01:36:44,960 --> 01:36:49,039
yields suffered but it was

2816
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:49,840
not as bad as if we had let the cola go

2817
01:36:49,039 --> 01:36:53,840
to a dried up

2818
01:36:49,840 --> 01:36:53,840
crumbly you know

2819
01:36:54,158 --> 01:36:58,479
i mean this might still have thc in it

2820
01:36:56,319 --> 01:37:00,880
and

2821
01:36:58,479 --> 01:37:02,238
you can use the the turbo over there

2822
01:37:00,880 --> 01:37:05,359
yeah there's there's mech

2823
01:37:02,238 --> 01:37:08,000
there's i mean we we probably all smoke

2824
01:37:05,359 --> 01:37:10,319
mexican weed that looked worse than that

2825
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,319
right

2826
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:15,920
yeah but uh yeah i don't

2827
01:37:14,479 --> 01:37:18,399
i don't think unfortunately not for a

2828
01:37:15,920 --> 01:37:20,800
very long time

2829
01:37:18,399 --> 01:37:21,599
yeah well this is has been really

2830
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:24,400
interesting

2831
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:26,400
um i i mean i thought about that but i

2832
01:37:24,399 --> 01:37:28,638
didn't even know i mean how i mean

2833
01:37:26,399 --> 01:37:30,559
because the flowering cycle was really

2834
01:37:28,639 --> 01:37:32,319
started relatively recently

2835
01:37:30,560 --> 01:37:35,199
too and that was really fast too

2836
01:37:32,319 --> 01:37:35,198
everything was beautiful

2837
01:37:38,800 --> 01:37:42,239
that's what you know you know now yeah

2838
01:37:40,719 --> 01:37:44,719
as soon as you see it

2839
01:37:42,238 --> 01:37:46,079
a moth you know you gotta set up traps

2840
01:37:44,719 --> 01:37:48,800
next year once you

2841
01:37:46,079 --> 01:37:49,279
as soon as you you start as soon as you

2842
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:52,159
take it

2843
01:37:49,279 --> 01:37:52,960
like rocky knocked down by apollo creed

2844
01:37:52,158 --> 01:37:55,039
and it's an eight

2845
01:37:52,960 --> 01:37:56,719
count and he's getting back up to plant

2846
01:37:55,039 --> 01:37:58,158
again next season

2847
01:37:56,719 --> 01:37:59,840
yeah well it's not too late right

2848
01:37:58,158 --> 01:38:01,519
couldn't you do anything

2849
01:37:59,840 --> 01:38:03,600
but yeah you just uh you know the other

2850
01:38:01,520 --> 01:38:05,360
thing we talked about is uh if we are

2851
01:38:03,600 --> 01:38:07,119
talking about botrytis which

2852
01:38:05,359 --> 01:38:08,639
you know again i'm not i'm not really

2853
01:38:07,118 --> 01:38:12,319
convinced yet

2854
01:38:08,639 --> 01:38:13,840
um wait you're not getting 100

2855
01:38:12,319 --> 01:38:16,399
that that's what's going on you're like

2856
01:38:13,840 --> 01:38:17,199
98 yeah it's just i don't see like

2857
01:38:16,399 --> 01:38:19,118
typical

2858
01:38:17,198 --> 01:38:22,079
structures of the fungus it's all dried

2859
01:38:19,118 --> 01:38:24,639
out and the fact that i see all that

2860
01:38:22,079 --> 01:38:26,158
you're seeing a unique disease maybe in

2861
01:38:24,639 --> 01:38:28,719
addition to the scale

2862
01:38:26,158 --> 01:38:31,839
which is unique we also have well i mean

2863
01:38:28,719 --> 01:38:31,840
that is

2864
01:38:35,920 --> 01:38:39,279
but it's like a disease rather than just

2865
01:38:38,238 --> 01:38:41,279
like it's just

2866
01:38:39,279 --> 01:38:42,719
it's just again break those buds open

2867
01:38:41,279 --> 01:38:45,439
and if you find

2868
01:38:42,719 --> 01:38:47,118
feces and every one i mean i did i

2869
01:38:45,439 --> 01:38:47,359
looked at a lot a few quite a few of

2870
01:38:47,118 --> 01:38:49,679
them

2871
01:38:47,359 --> 01:38:51,519
you saw a lot of females then it is the

2872
01:38:49,679 --> 01:38:53,520
cat yeah and then where are they

2873
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:54,880
where did they go did they finish their

2874
01:38:53,520 --> 01:38:55,840
that you know they've got to go into it

2875
01:38:54,880 --> 01:38:58,960
and you've become an

2876
01:38:55,840 --> 01:39:01,039
expert in identification of the

2877
01:38:58,960 --> 01:39:03,600
different fecal matter from different

2878
01:39:01,039 --> 01:39:05,600
uh species of caterpillar no but you

2879
01:39:03,600 --> 01:39:08,159
know there's a difference between like

2880
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:09,840
snails you aspire to that skill set

2881
01:39:08,158 --> 01:39:12,879
eventually i'll get there i guess

2882
01:39:09,840 --> 01:39:15,279
maybe that's one of our gemma trainings

2883
01:39:12,880 --> 01:39:16,319
to be able to identify the different uh

2884
01:39:15,279 --> 01:39:18,880
caterpillar poop

2885
01:39:16,319 --> 01:39:18,880
by flavor

2886
01:39:19,359 --> 01:39:24,000
cornea where cornea worm tastes a little

2887
01:39:21,600 --> 01:39:24,000
corny

2888
01:39:24,158 --> 01:39:30,799
all right well i think that was a good

2889
01:39:27,840 --> 01:39:32,000
well yeah that's a good deep dive and i

2890
01:39:30,800 --> 01:39:34,320
think we have a

2891
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:35,600
a semi game plan for earlier in the

2892
01:39:34,319 --> 01:39:37,920
season next year

2893
01:39:35,600 --> 01:39:38,880
oh yeah i mean just start monitoring

2894
01:39:37,920 --> 01:39:41,520
look into

2895
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:43,199
again first step let's id those collect

2896
01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:44,480
as many as you can and put them in jars

2897
01:39:43,198 --> 01:39:47,919
i left you these

2898
01:39:44,479 --> 01:39:49,839
and then uh you know because that that's

2899
01:39:47,920 --> 01:39:51,520
where it starts and then okay well we we

2900
01:39:49,840 --> 01:39:53,440
have at least we know who's hitting us

2901
01:39:51,520 --> 01:39:55,840
yeah we know the one we had on the table

2902
01:39:53,439 --> 01:39:59,198
uh uh

2903
01:39:55,840 --> 01:40:02,319
uh what is it what does a caterpillar do

2904
01:39:59,198 --> 01:40:04,158
inched it inched away yeah

2905
01:40:02,319 --> 01:40:06,000
anyway it's it's you let's say you know

2906
01:40:04,158 --> 01:40:07,439
you have three of them eating your buds

2907
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,719
three different species in your buds

2908
01:40:07,439 --> 01:40:09,359
then you go look for what the adults

2909
01:40:08,719 --> 01:40:11,359
look like

2910
01:40:09,359 --> 01:40:12,799
you figure out how to identify them and

2911
01:40:11,359 --> 01:40:14,079
that's what you that's what you look for

2912
01:40:12,800 --> 01:40:14,960
in your traps as soon as you see that

2913
01:40:14,079 --> 01:40:16,639
one of those adults

2914
01:40:14,960 --> 01:40:18,639
that would be epic if we actually

2915
01:40:16,639 --> 01:40:20,880
identified two different

2916
01:40:18,639 --> 01:40:22,880
dis specific species what happened we're

2917
01:40:20,880 --> 01:40:24,800
totally

2918
01:40:22,880 --> 01:40:26,480
we actually discover them so then we can

2919
01:40:24,800 --> 01:40:28,880
create and get they're also new

2920
01:40:26,479 --> 01:40:29,678
on discovery yeah well right now i think

2921
01:40:28,880 --> 01:40:31,359
i'm uh

2922
01:40:29,679 --> 01:40:33,359
jet well i have to name them what's it

2923
01:40:31,359 --> 01:40:35,920
the uh corn ear

2924
01:40:33,359 --> 01:40:36,399
yeah the corn ear worm yeah that's

2925
01:40:35,920 --> 01:40:38,399
that's

2926
01:40:36,399 --> 01:40:39,759
our worm of choice yeah it's a common

2927
01:40:38,399 --> 01:40:41,198
one in the valley

2928
01:40:39,760 --> 01:40:43,039
of los angeles but it's not the only one

2929
01:40:41,198 --> 01:40:44,158
though gemma can a killer or something

2930
01:40:43,039 --> 01:40:46,079
like that right well

2931
01:40:44,158 --> 01:40:48,000
nate we'll name the new discovery after

2932
01:40:46,079 --> 01:40:49,039
gemma or we'll let her name it when

2933
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:51,679
you're called in

2934
01:40:49,039 --> 01:40:53,439
is it uh is it i would assume it's

2935
01:40:51,679 --> 01:40:56,960
better for you to be working with

2936
01:40:53,439 --> 01:40:59,759
grows like from the get-go yeah so

2937
01:40:56,960 --> 01:41:01,600
i do i i work for a biochemistry brought

2938
01:40:59,760 --> 01:41:03,119
in once there is a problem yeah

2939
01:41:01,600 --> 01:41:04,960
is that your least favorite time to come

2940
01:41:03,118 --> 01:41:07,118
in that's probably one year well i

2941
01:41:04,960 --> 01:41:08,399
work yeah unfortunately so that's that's

2942
01:41:07,118 --> 01:41:10,399
a big message too

2943
01:41:08,399 --> 01:41:11,679
um so i work for a bio control company

2944
01:41:10,399 --> 01:41:14,559
right we we sell

2945
01:41:11,679 --> 01:41:16,239
insects for crop protection and other

2946
01:41:14,560 --> 01:41:20,880
predators for crop protection

2947
01:41:16,238 --> 01:41:24,638
right so um in in our industry

2948
01:41:20,880 --> 01:41:26,960
it's it's all about vigilance because

2949
01:41:24,639 --> 01:41:29,359
if we rely on sprays and try to

2950
01:41:26,960 --> 01:41:30,480
integrate a biological control program

2951
01:41:29,359 --> 01:41:34,079
you will struggle

2952
01:41:30,479 --> 01:41:36,079
because some of those sprays will hurt

2953
01:41:34,079 --> 01:41:37,920
the predators you've put into like how

2954
01:41:36,079 --> 01:41:41,279
are the marone products

2955
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:44,719
um i have some experience with them

2956
01:41:41,279 --> 01:41:46,960
they um they do say i've attended some

2957
01:41:44,719 --> 01:41:47,920
of their presentations some of their

2958
01:41:46,960 --> 01:41:49,760
webinars

2959
01:41:47,920 --> 01:41:51,679
and they do say that they are softer on

2960
01:41:49,760 --> 01:41:53,920
beneficials but i personally haven't

2961
01:41:51,679 --> 01:41:56,079
seen the research so i don't know

2962
01:41:53,920 --> 01:41:57,840
so they're like while this may do

2963
01:41:56,079 --> 01:42:01,279
something to beneficials

2964
01:41:57,840 --> 01:42:02,159
uh it is not as bad as what it's doing

2965
01:42:01,279 --> 01:42:03,759
to the thing you don't

2966
01:42:02,158 --> 01:42:05,198
yeah and that's a it's a tough one you

2967
01:42:03,760 --> 01:42:06,719
got to say okay well give

2968
01:42:05,198 --> 01:42:09,039
give me the mode of action how is it

2969
01:42:06,719 --> 01:42:11,760
behaving because for example um

2970
01:42:09,039 --> 01:42:13,118
bt basilisk or in genesis if you told me

2971
01:42:11,760 --> 01:42:14,400
you know what this is dangerous to your

2972
01:42:13,118 --> 01:42:16,880
to the caterpillars

2973
01:42:14,399 --> 01:42:18,158
but it's not dangerous to aphid that's

2974
01:42:16,880 --> 01:42:18,800
absolutely true because the mode of

2975
01:42:18,158 --> 01:42:21,439
action is

2976
01:42:18,800 --> 01:42:22,960
only for caterpillars right so if we

2977
01:42:21,439 --> 01:42:25,279
knew the mode of action of some of these

2978
01:42:22,960 --> 01:42:26,399
other products that claim that they are

2979
01:42:25,279 --> 01:42:28,399
harmful to

2980
01:42:26,399 --> 01:42:29,920
pests but not to the beneficials and we

2981
01:42:28,399 --> 01:42:31,679
find that it made sense and there's some

2982
01:42:29,920 --> 01:42:33,118
research and made sense that

2983
01:42:31,679 --> 01:42:34,719
they would they would hurt your pests

2984
01:42:33,118 --> 01:42:35,759
and not your beneficials and you could

2985
01:42:34,719 --> 01:42:37,279
say all right well

2986
01:42:35,760 --> 01:42:39,280
you know there's something to this right

2987
01:42:37,279 --> 01:42:42,719
you know

2988
01:42:39,279 --> 01:42:45,519
tom i'm digging those uh flavored waters

2989
01:42:42,719 --> 01:42:46,158
uh i don't i think we're out oh she got

2990
01:42:45,520 --> 01:42:48,639
more

2991
01:42:46,158 --> 01:42:48,638
i don't know

2992
01:42:49,840 --> 01:42:53,199
i thought they were new purchases when

2993
01:42:51,760 --> 01:42:55,600
they uh

2994
01:42:53,198 --> 01:42:57,118
showed up mysteriously in front of me i

2995
01:42:55,600 --> 01:42:57,760
drank both of them oh did you already

2996
01:42:57,118 --> 01:43:00,799
have one

2997
01:42:57,760 --> 01:43:00,800
i had two oh

2998
01:43:02,319 --> 01:43:07,118
no i didn't well so you do you take the

2999
01:43:05,520 --> 01:43:08,560
the video and then you do it you add it

3000
01:43:07,118 --> 01:43:09,279
out and everything all that kind of

3001
01:43:08,560 --> 01:43:11,600
stuff

3002
01:43:09,279 --> 01:43:12,880
yeah like a two camera i mean this is

3003
01:43:11,600 --> 01:43:14,800
like it actually

3004
01:43:12,880 --> 01:43:16,800
i mean this camera i think overheated

3005
01:43:14,800 --> 01:43:20,800
but uh

3006
01:43:16,800 --> 01:43:23,600
like it's effective and it's budget like

3007
01:43:20,800 --> 01:43:24,960
i can easily carry two iphones around

3008
01:43:23,600 --> 01:43:27,039
and two microphones

3009
01:43:24,960 --> 01:43:29,439
and be like i could actually do a cool

3010
01:43:27,039 --> 01:43:32,560
conversation

3011
01:43:29,439 --> 01:43:34,719

it's not tom we should also know what

3044
01:44:49,279 --> 01:44:52,158
the adult form looks like so you don't

3045
01:44:51,118 --> 01:44:53,439
kill

3046
01:44:52,158 --> 01:44:56,479

3049
01:44:59,439 --> 01:45:02,319
not

3050
01:44:59,760 --> 01:45:04,880
knock to it i think is a family noctuaty

3051
01:45:02,319 --> 01:45:04,880
thing looks big

3052
01:45:06,319 --> 01:45:12,639
my noctuads can be very did you see any

3053
01:45:09,679 --> 01:45:12,639
of these around tom

3054
01:45:13,439 --> 01:45:16,479
that's what the adult looks like it's a

3055
01:45:15,198 --> 01:45:19,919
brown

3056
01:45:16,479 --> 01:45:21,919
tannish brown moth you know beyond the

3057
01:45:19,920 --> 01:45:24,639
lookout for that one

3058
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:25,279
yeah that thing isn't okay what size is

3059
01:45:24,639 --> 01:45:27,840
it you know

3060
01:45:25,279 --> 01:45:29,439
it's kind of big again i've it's not a

3061
01:45:27,840 --> 01:45:33,039
pest that i commonly battle

3062
01:45:29,439 --> 01:45:35,118
uh look at this this wedge shape is like

3063
01:45:33,039 --> 01:45:37,340
that's it's a knock to it right i think

3064
01:45:35,118 --> 01:45:39,039
it is even though it'll look for him

3065
01:45:37,340 --> 01:45:40,400
[Laughter]

3066
01:45:39,039 --> 01:45:41,519
yeah well that's it you know that is

3067
01:45:40,399 --> 01:45:42,638
what that's the other place where we

3068
01:45:41,520 --> 01:45:44,960
come in

3069
01:45:42,639 --> 01:45:44,960
like all

3070
01:45:47,520 --> 01:45:51,360
for example after i came two weeks ago

3071
01:45:49,840 --> 01:45:52,880
i'm bummed that like i didn't come

3072
01:45:51,359 --> 01:45:54,960
five days later because we would have

3073
01:45:52,880 --> 01:45:57,440
started to notice stuff

3074
01:45:54,960 --> 01:45:59,118
here's a good photo it's it's it shows

3075
01:45:57,439 --> 01:46:01,759
you that kind of triangular

3076
01:45:59,118 --> 01:46:02,479
yes yeah yeah you know they look very

3077
01:46:01,760 --> 01:46:03,840
like that

3078
01:46:02,479 --> 01:46:05,519
you gotta look for things like the

3079
01:46:03,840 --> 01:46:08,000
spotting on them

3080
01:46:05,520 --> 01:46:08,560
and you know you see this on the on the

3081
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,238
second

3082
01:46:08,560 --> 01:46:12,159
wing so there's two wings like that

3083
01:46:10,238 --> 01:46:14,079
right is that male or female

3084
01:46:12,158 --> 01:46:16,158
i don't know i'd have to look but you

3085
01:46:14,079 --> 01:46:16,880
see the brown you see the second wing

3086
01:46:16,158 --> 01:46:18,559
you know how

3087
01:46:16,880 --> 01:46:20,880
butterflies have two wings this bottom

3088
01:46:18,560 --> 01:46:23,039
wing has that browning on the edge

3089
01:46:20,880 --> 01:46:24,880
that could be a big identifying feature

3090
01:46:23,039 --> 01:46:26,719
well what happens when it lands

3091
01:46:24,880 --> 01:46:29,359
is it going to last i'm just generally

3092
01:46:26,719 --> 01:46:31,279
any big moth take out

3093
01:46:29,359 --> 01:46:33,359
well don't kill them don't kill them

3094
01:46:31,279 --> 01:46:34,319
catch them catch them because we can id

3095
01:46:33,359 --> 01:46:36,559
them if you if

3096
01:46:34,319 --> 01:46:38,439
you catch them on glue right but once

3097
01:46:36,560 --> 01:46:41,119
the idea

3098
01:46:38,439 --> 01:46:42,559
yeah put them in there put the glue in

3099
01:46:41,118 --> 01:46:46,319
the refrigerator

3100
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:48,639
and and a guy a guy um i work with a

3101
01:46:46,319 --> 01:46:50,719
another cannabis grower he's indoor and

3102
01:46:48,639 --> 01:46:54,000
out there up in santa cruz county

3103
01:46:50,719 --> 01:46:56,480
he um last time i visited him he's

3104
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:58,399
like hey um time you put the pin through

3105
01:46:56,479 --> 01:47:00,959
it i found a bud

3106
01:46:58,399 --> 01:47:02,879
he said i found a bug a a weird red bug

3107
01:47:00,960 --> 01:47:05,118
i'd never seen before

3108
01:47:02,880 --> 01:47:06,239
at the base of one of my plants and it

3109
01:47:05,118 --> 01:47:09,439
it was just

3110
01:47:06,238 --> 01:47:11,039
like a hundred of them just at the base

3111
01:47:09,439 --> 01:47:13,359
and i said did you catch and he said

3112
01:47:11,039 --> 01:47:15,439
yeah and he caught it but the mistake he

3113
01:47:13,359 --> 01:47:17,679
made is he didn't put it in alcohol

3114
01:47:15,439 --> 01:47:19,359
so it just shriveled up to it shriveled

3115
01:47:17,679 --> 01:47:20,880
in the fridge at least he put it in the

3116
01:47:19,359 --> 01:47:23,839
fridge so when i id'd it

3117
01:47:20,880 --> 01:47:25,760
luckily this bug is so distinctive it

3118
01:47:23,840 --> 01:47:26,079
was easy to tell what it was and it was

3119
01:47:25,760 --> 01:47:28,159
a

3120
01:47:26,079 --> 01:47:30,559
bug called the bagrata bug which is

3121
01:47:28,158 --> 01:47:31,839
common in cold crops and a problem in

3122
01:47:30,560 --> 01:47:33,600
cold crops

3123
01:47:31,840 --> 01:47:35,520
bro i found it on his cannabis on

3124
01:47:33,600 --> 01:47:37,520
cannabis so okay so does that come in

3125
01:47:35,520 --> 01:47:38,719
first sighting of bagrata bug that i

3126
01:47:37,520 --> 01:47:42,080
know of okay

3127
01:47:38,719 --> 01:47:43,520
but and when was this it was on the base

3128
01:47:42,079 --> 01:47:46,158
of the plant

3129
01:47:43,520 --> 01:47:46,639
and this like the trunk of it the very

3130
01:47:46,158 --> 01:47:50,799
bottom

3131
01:47:46,639 --> 01:47:54,000
trunk right and and it it

3132
01:47:50,800 --> 01:47:56,960
was a gl what is it you know

3133
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:58,719
gathering there but how could it be

3134
01:47:56,960 --> 01:48:00,880
feeding on such

3135
01:47:58,719 --> 01:48:03,118
tough tissue i mean hemp tissue is

3136
01:48:00,880 --> 01:48:04,880
really strong and this was a nymphal

3137
01:48:03,118 --> 01:48:09,279
stage this was just a nymph

3138
01:48:04,880 --> 01:48:11,840
um no it had not molded to an adult yet

3139
01:48:09,279 --> 01:48:13,118
it was in the process of molting um so

3140
01:48:11,840 --> 01:48:14,560
it didn't have its wings yet you could

3141
01:48:13,118 --> 01:48:15,118
tell it was a nymph that's how you can

3142
01:48:14,560 --> 01:48:16,480
id that

3143
01:48:15,118 --> 01:48:18,639
okay you can tell okay this looks like

3144
01:48:16,479 --> 01:48:20,158
the second stage yeah

3145
01:48:18,639 --> 01:48:22,159
yeah and you can find you can id them

3146
01:48:20,158 --> 01:48:22,799
with their eggs so what could have

3147
01:48:22,158 --> 01:48:25,599
happened

3148
01:48:22,800 --> 01:48:26,159
is a bagrata bug from a local cabbage

3149
01:48:25,600 --> 01:48:29,760
farm

3150
01:48:26,158 --> 01:48:32,079
or some wild mustard out there flew in

3151
01:48:29,760 --> 01:48:33,440
got confused laid its eggs that's what

3152
01:48:32,079 --> 01:48:35,519
could happen with that scale

3153
01:48:33,439 --> 01:48:37,519
oh and maybe won't eat the plan no i

3154
01:48:35,520 --> 01:48:40,239
mean well my problem at all

3155
01:48:37,520 --> 01:48:42,000
it's like it's like a whale that went up

3156
01:48:40,238 --> 01:48:43,279
the river and then like couldn't figure

3157
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,719
out how to get back yeah

3158
01:48:43,279 --> 01:48:46,719
that doesn't mean that we should block

3159
01:48:44,719 --> 01:48:47,439
all rivers so the whales won't go in

3160
01:48:46,719 --> 01:48:50,480
right

3161
01:48:47,439 --> 01:48:52,559
um where's when's it a problem right

3162
01:48:50,479 --> 01:48:54,718
it's uh although i could see california

3163
01:48:52,560 --> 01:48:58,080
doing that

3164
01:48:54,719 --> 01:48:58,079
let's over regulate this

3165
01:48:58,880 --> 01:49:05,118
cripple everybody so um yeah

3166
01:49:02,479 --> 01:49:05,599
yeah so yeah do most props like they

3167
01:49:05,118 --> 01:49:08,639
they

3168
01:49:05,600 --> 01:49:11,679
like they do they lose a percentage

3169
01:49:08,639 --> 01:49:14,239
to uh to stuff like this

3170
01:49:11,679 --> 01:49:17,039
like do they have like an acceptable

3171
01:49:14,238 --> 01:49:17,519
percentage of crop loss to yeah so great

3172
01:49:17,039 --> 01:49:19,198
i mean

3173
01:49:17,520 --> 01:49:21,360
you're you're hitting on you're hitting

3174
01:49:19,198 --> 01:49:22,960
on the subject that i like to talk about

3175
01:49:21,359 --> 01:49:24,479
we're asking good questions so they're

3176
01:49:22,960 --> 01:49:28,000
on fire yeah so

3177
01:49:24,479 --> 01:49:31,279
okay so you know obviously um we

3178
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:31,840
have we can see what pests can do right

3179
01:49:31,279 --> 01:49:34,000
um

3180
01:49:31,840 --> 01:49:35,840
they they'll harm your they harm your

3181
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:38,399
property and they harm your

3182
01:49:35,840 --> 01:49:39,440
your yields and therefore your you know

3183
01:49:38,399 --> 01:49:41,519
what you make

3184
01:49:39,439 --> 01:49:42,638
what what what you what you're money

3185
01:49:41,520 --> 01:49:46,159
maker yeah right

3186
01:49:42,639 --> 01:49:49,279
so but tom shakes but but

3187
01:49:46,158 --> 01:49:50,000
but bt is not free right you have to pay

3188
01:49:49,279 --> 01:49:53,279
for it so

3189
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:56,319
at what point is using bt

3190
01:49:53,279 --> 01:49:59,439
a good idea right right all year long

3191
01:49:56,319 --> 01:50:01,439
every you know from start to finish

3192
01:49:59,439 --> 01:50:03,519
yeah you probably stand more chance

3193
01:50:01,439 --> 01:50:05,759
protecting from

3194
01:50:03,520 --> 01:50:07,679
caterpillar if you do it that way but

3195
01:50:05,760 --> 01:50:11,360
did you

3196
01:50:07,679 --> 01:50:13,199
did you really make more money or

3197
01:50:11,359 --> 01:50:15,118
did you throw it away in your material

3198
01:50:13,198 --> 01:50:16,879
you use right so there's

3199
01:50:15,118 --> 01:50:18,960
there's what we call the co the concept

3200
01:50:16,880 --> 01:50:21,199
of the economic injury level

3201
01:50:18,960 --> 01:50:22,560
which is like well like first of all you

3202
01:50:21,198 --> 01:50:26,719
have to figure that out so

3203
01:50:22,560 --> 01:50:29,920
say you have so what is the cost of uh

3204
01:50:26,719 --> 01:50:33,439
of the bt for say you know

3205
01:50:29,920 --> 01:50:34,960
i don't know uh you know 100 plant drugs

3206
01:50:33,439 --> 01:50:36,559
i'd have to i'd have to really look that

3207
01:50:34,960 --> 01:50:38,480
up honestly or is it

3208
01:50:36,560 --> 01:50:40,320
like percentage-wise like you're going

3209
01:50:38,479 --> 01:50:42,559
okay you know i mean is it

3210
01:50:40,319 --> 01:50:43,519
in the single digit percentages that

3211
01:50:42,560 --> 01:50:46,400
you're

3212
01:50:43,520 --> 01:50:50,719
you know i mean usually a lot of these

3213
01:50:46,399 --> 01:50:54,158
soft materials are pretty inexpensive so

3214
01:50:50,719 --> 01:50:57,198
but um but again you know it's

3215
01:50:54,158 --> 01:50:59,118
you put labor into it also

3216
01:50:57,198 --> 01:51:00,238
you know you you put you had to put

3217
01:50:59,118 --> 01:51:02,880
labor into it

3218
01:51:00,238 --> 01:51:03,919
you um there's all that involved in it

3219
01:51:02,880 --> 01:51:06,159
and and

3220
01:51:03,920 --> 01:51:07,359
that's why we've developed this concept

3221
01:51:06,158 --> 01:51:09,439
of the

3222
01:51:07,359 --> 01:51:11,439
economic injury level where at a certain

3223
01:51:09,439 --> 01:51:15,039
point it pays to do

3224
01:51:11,439 --> 01:51:16,238
something before that point it doesn't

3225
01:51:15,039 --> 01:51:19,679
pay to do something so

3226
01:51:16,238 --> 01:51:20,079
okay so this is an extreme situation

3227
01:51:19,679 --> 01:51:22,639
because

3228
01:51:20,079 --> 01:51:23,599
everything here has been impacted by

3229
01:51:22,639 --> 01:51:25,679
this but you

3230
01:51:23,599 --> 01:51:26,960
but if you and this is not a commercial

3231
01:51:25,679 --> 01:51:29,440
but in commercial you

3232
01:51:26,960 --> 01:51:31,198
certainly would would not want this

3233
01:51:29,439 --> 01:51:34,079
which is why i asked about

3234
01:51:31,198 --> 01:51:35,439
is is there a percentage like that like

3235
01:51:34,079 --> 01:51:38,238
if there's a trade-off but

3236
01:51:35,439 --> 01:51:40,000
if but how does how does a farmer know

3237
01:51:38,238 --> 01:51:40,959
what percentage of their crop they might

3238
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,800
lose

3239
01:51:40,960 --> 01:51:44,880
to a situation like this before they

3240
01:51:42,800 --> 01:51:46,159
happen it's a very simple solute very

3241
01:51:44,880 --> 01:51:49,118
simple answer

3242
01:51:46,158 --> 01:51:51,839
research university research and how

3243
01:51:49,118 --> 01:51:55,039
long have we been researching this crop

3244
01:51:51,840 --> 01:51:57,199
at the university level now

3245
01:51:55,039 --> 01:51:58,719
let's talk about other lucrative

3246
01:51:57,198 --> 01:51:59,919
california crops let's talk about the

3247
01:51:58,719 --> 01:52:03,279
top two

3248
01:51:59,920 --> 01:52:04,800
almonds and grapes right do they have

3249
01:52:03,279 --> 01:52:06,800
guidelines

3250
01:52:04,800 --> 01:52:09,360
they actually do you could get on go

3251
01:52:06,800 --> 01:52:12,400
online there's resources available

3252
01:52:09,359 --> 01:52:13,279
where they'll tell you if you have x

3253
01:52:12,399 --> 01:52:17,039
amount of

3254
01:52:13,279 --> 01:52:17,920
this pest per leaf after sampling 20

3255
01:52:17,039 --> 01:52:21,519
leaves

3256
01:52:17,920 --> 01:52:21,920
in a 100 square foot area then you must

3257
01:52:21,520 --> 01:52:24,960
act

3258
01:52:21,920 --> 01:52:25,760
but before then you don't see what i'm

3259
01:52:24,960 --> 01:52:27,359
saying

3260
01:52:25,760 --> 01:52:29,599
we don't we just don't know yet so we

3261
01:52:27,359 --> 01:52:30,079
don't have those and the guidelines for

3262
01:52:29,599 --> 01:52:32,319
the crop

3263
01:52:30,079 --> 01:52:34,238
are very can be very detailed i mean for

3264
01:52:32,319 --> 01:52:36,719
grapes and uh for grapes and

3265
01:52:34,238 --> 01:52:37,279
almonds um you know they're they're

3266
01:52:36,719 --> 01:52:40,399
fairly

3267
01:52:37,279 --> 01:52:42,719
this is really interesting for other

3268
01:52:40,399 --> 01:52:45,118
crops there's guidelines so if you see a

3269
01:52:42,719 --> 01:52:48,158
certain percentage of pests

3270
01:52:45,118 --> 01:52:51,759
um in a certain uh

3271
01:52:48,158 --> 01:52:54,158
area then it's then it's a time to act

3272
01:52:51,760 --> 01:52:57,360
and those are very specific guidelines

3273
01:52:54,158 --> 01:52:58,879
it's it's a it's a mathematical equation

3274
01:52:57,359 --> 01:53:00,639
but that none of those guidelines

3275
01:52:58,880 --> 01:53:03,520
haven't been established for cannabis

3276
01:53:00,639 --> 01:53:05,599
not yet not and that's uh i think we

3277
01:53:03,520 --> 01:53:07,679
blew past these safe caterpillar

3278
01:53:05,599 --> 01:53:09,520
thresholds there's no question that we

3279
01:53:07,679 --> 01:53:11,520
did but that's why i asked it's like

3280
01:53:09,520 --> 01:53:13,280
like this is just a home grow but for a

3281
01:53:11,520 --> 01:53:14,480
commercial you wouldn't want to lose

3282
01:53:13,279 --> 01:53:17,198
your entire right

3283
01:53:14,479 --> 01:53:18,638
and neither did we neither did we so

3284
01:53:17,198 --> 01:53:21,279
it's not all loss you could

3285
01:53:18,639 --> 01:53:21,840
you could still still you can pretty

3286
01:53:21,279 --> 01:53:24,479
close

3287
01:53:21,840 --> 01:53:25,920
you can get some live resin out of that

3288
01:53:24,479 --> 01:53:26,799
we can make some but if we don't know

3289
01:53:25,920 --> 01:53:28,319
how we have bridges

3290
01:53:26,800 --> 01:53:30,000
is there still anything that's small

3291
01:53:28,319 --> 01:53:31,840
like would you make hash out of that

3292
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:33,679
sure yeah you can make like like like

3293
01:53:31,840 --> 01:53:35,360
ice water hash yeah like you would

3294
01:53:33,679 --> 01:53:36,960
there's there's trichomes on the leaves

3295
01:53:35,359 --> 01:53:39,039
there's you know

3296
01:53:36,960 --> 01:53:40,800
but there's also a whole lot of botrytis

3297
01:53:39,039 --> 01:53:43,359
right yeah but you're filtering

3298
01:53:40,800 --> 01:53:45,039
it you're filtering it out right your

3299
01:53:43,359 --> 01:53:47,920
bags filter that out

3300
01:53:45,039 --> 01:53:49,679
a lot of it um not the spores okay what

3301
01:53:47,920 --> 01:53:52,880
what do the spores do when you burn them

3302
01:53:49,679 --> 01:53:54,079
i don't inhale them i i would i would

3303
01:53:52,880 --> 01:53:56,639
venture to guess

3304
01:53:54,079 --> 01:54:00,399
not much you'd probably have less

3305
01:53:56,639 --> 01:54:00,400
botrytis spores yeah into your life

3306
01:54:00,960 --> 01:54:04,239
i mean if we're talking about

3307
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:05,760
aspergillus lungs yeah

3308
01:54:04,238 --> 01:54:08,158
if we're talking about aspergillus mold

3309
01:54:05,760 --> 01:54:09,360
then don't forget does aspergillus grow

3310
01:54:08,158 --> 01:54:12,319
on plants

3311
01:54:09,359 --> 01:54:13,359
that dying tissue yeah so i can

3312
01:54:12,319 --> 01:54:14,639
guarantee you that

3313
01:54:13,359 --> 01:54:16,799
i know but that would be only like you

3314
01:54:14,639 --> 01:54:18,239
could eat it it's just if you smoked or

3315
01:54:16,800 --> 01:54:20,560
actually no the sport is inhaling the

3316
01:54:18,238 --> 01:54:22,319
spores yeah well i mean if you if you

3317
01:54:20,560 --> 01:54:22,639
think about it you you have a joint

3318
01:54:22,319 --> 01:54:24,880
right

3319
01:54:22,639 --> 01:54:27,359
and you light it or pre-roll you light

3320
01:54:24,880 --> 01:54:28,079
it that first puff isn't all burning

3321
01:54:27,359 --> 01:54:29,679
smoke

3322
01:54:28,079 --> 01:54:32,719
there's some whatever spores were in

3323
01:54:29,679 --> 01:54:34,639
there went right into your lungs

3324
01:54:32,719 --> 01:54:36,960
alive and they got shot right into your

3325
01:54:34,639 --> 01:54:40,480
legs nice

3326
01:54:36,960 --> 01:54:43,520
so you know but yeah i mean in a resin

3327
01:54:40,479 --> 01:54:44,000
you know in a in a in a live resin

3328
01:54:43,520 --> 01:54:45,840
you're going to

3329
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:47,198
go through all this purification i know

3330
01:54:45,840 --> 01:54:50,960
live resin i'm saying

3331
01:54:47,198 --> 01:54:53,039
ice water happens i couldn't tell you i

3332
01:54:50,960 --> 01:54:54,158
you know dive into the research but try

3333
01:54:53,039 --> 01:54:56,560
this lung

3334
01:54:54,158 --> 01:54:58,158
problems and i'm sure someone's done

3335
01:54:56,560 --> 01:54:59,039
something but i haven't heard that it's

3336
01:54:58,158 --> 01:55:02,799
prominent

3337
01:54:59,039 --> 01:55:04,800
right all right well let's uh

3338
01:55:02,800 --> 01:55:06,960
so i just realized that gemma missed not

3339
01:55:04,800 --> 01:55:08,000
only her three-hour chinese class this

3340
01:55:06,960 --> 01:55:10,960
morning but

3341
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:11,520
she also just missed her uh dance class

3342
01:55:10,960 --> 01:55:13,840
too oh

3343
01:55:11,520 --> 01:55:15,119
is she happy from that she does the

3344
01:55:13,840 --> 01:55:17,440
dance she yeah she

3345
01:55:15,118 --> 01:55:18,799
she hates she hates it yeah so she

3346
01:55:17,439 --> 01:55:21,279
wasn't going to remind you

3347
01:55:18,800 --> 01:55:22,880
she wasn't going to remind you four and

3348
01:55:21,279 --> 01:55:26,000
a half hours of

3349
01:55:22,880 --> 01:55:28,239
zoom oh so it's all online

3350
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:31,039
the dance class too yeah the dance class

3351
01:55:28,238 --> 01:55:33,198
was and i and i knew it was 2 45 and i

3352
01:55:31,039 --> 01:55:35,599
texted her mom being like what like is

3353
01:55:33,198 --> 01:55:36,238
there a zoom link for her 245 class

3354
01:55:35,599 --> 01:55:37,920
she's like

3355
01:55:36,238 --> 01:55:40,319
i'll check on the link i think class is

3356
01:55:37,920 --> 01:55:43,118
at 3 45 so i was like oh okay

3357
01:55:40,319 --> 01:55:44,479
and then i come back and yeah like she

3358
01:55:43,118 --> 01:55:45,759
forwarded something from the teacher

3359
01:55:44,479 --> 01:55:48,799
that's like we'll see you at 2

3360
01:55:45,760 --> 01:55:51,760
45 and it's now

3361
01:55:48,800 --> 01:55:51,760
like 4 10.

3362
01:55:51,920 --> 01:55:57,679
well you learned about cornea worm

3363
01:55:55,439 --> 01:55:58,839
that's right well yeah it was a good use

3364
01:55:57,679 --> 01:56:03,039
of my time

3365
01:55:58,840 --> 01:56:05,119
yeah yeah i mean my interest in this was

3366
01:56:03,039 --> 01:56:07,760
like really literally first of all doing

3367
01:56:05,118 --> 01:56:09,519
it experiencing it but then

3368
01:56:07,760 --> 01:56:11,760
well yeah i've been smoking it and all

3369
01:56:09,520 --> 01:56:14,080
that but like

3370
01:56:11,760 --> 01:56:15,840
it's the homegrow aspect it's trying you

3371
01:56:14,079 --> 01:56:17,840
know it's trying to

3372
01:56:15,840 --> 01:56:19,599
bypass having to go and pay all those

3373
01:56:17,840 --> 01:56:20,560
taxes and you do all of that so

3374
01:56:19,599 --> 01:56:22,239
obviously

3375
01:56:20,560 --> 01:56:24,000
there's risks and there's all of that

3376
01:56:22,238 --> 01:56:24,399
and there's costs and there's time and

3377
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,079
there's

3378
01:56:24,399 --> 01:56:28,559
there's all of that but and it's a

3379
01:56:26,079 --> 01:56:29,679
learning process but generally there's

3380
01:56:28,560 --> 01:56:32,000
sadness right now

3381
01:56:29,679 --> 01:56:32,960
well yeah i mean this is not you know

3382
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:36,399
the outcome

3383
01:56:32,960 --> 01:56:37,599
that you want right now my my dominant

3384
01:56:36,399 --> 01:56:39,679
feeling is

3385
01:56:37,599 --> 01:56:41,440
like a lot of other people who might you

3386
01:56:39,679 --> 01:56:42,079
know like and everyone's doing their

3387
01:56:41,439 --> 01:56:44,799
gardening

3388
01:56:42,079 --> 01:56:46,639
now and you know there's a big argument

3389
01:56:44,800 --> 01:56:48,400
for like people probing their own

3390
01:56:46,639 --> 01:56:50,239
cannabis especially if you need

3391
01:56:48,399 --> 01:56:52,399
more you know if you wanna you know if

3392
01:56:50,238 --> 01:56:55,598
you're a patient and you wanna do that

3393
01:56:52,399 --> 01:56:57,839
but you you really gotta get past this

3394
01:56:55,599 --> 01:56:59,760
it takes a while there's yeah there's a

3395
01:56:57,840 --> 01:57:01,599
there's a learning curve

3396
01:56:59,760 --> 01:57:03,360
you just have to remember we've taken a

3397
01:57:01,599 --> 01:57:08,560
plant from nature

3398
01:57:03,359 --> 01:57:10,799
and have we have bred it for

3399
01:57:08,560 --> 01:57:12,719
a certain characteristic right

3400
01:57:10,800 --> 01:57:15,920
production of

3401
01:57:12,719 --> 01:57:19,520
cannabinoids and terpenes high in oils

3402
01:57:15,920 --> 01:57:21,039
right um well there's a cost to that

3403
01:57:19,520 --> 01:57:23,360
right there's a cost to that it's the

3404
01:57:21,039 --> 01:57:24,319
same as um you know like we've taken

3405
01:57:23,359 --> 01:57:26,880
cows and

3406
01:57:24,319 --> 01:57:28,399
it used to be a wild animal that that

3407
01:57:26,880 --> 01:57:29,440
used to have better defenses against

3408
01:57:28,399 --> 01:57:31,039
predators

3409
01:57:29,439 --> 01:57:33,039
and nowadays we've you know we've

3410
01:57:31,039 --> 01:57:34,639
created cows their entire life is

3411
01:57:33,039 --> 01:57:35,359
intended you know they're just producing

3412
01:57:34,639 --> 01:57:38,480
milk

3413
01:57:35,359 --> 01:57:41,279
well and they're also in like cow cities

3414
01:57:38,479 --> 01:57:42,959
we're creating um plants with less with

3415
01:57:41,279 --> 01:57:44,800
fewer defenses potentially

3416
01:57:42,960 --> 01:57:47,599
yeah and if you look if you compare

3417
01:57:44,800 --> 01:57:49,360
indoor growing with outdoor growing um

3418
01:57:47,599 --> 01:57:51,840
you know a lot of indoor grows you're

3419
01:57:49,359 --> 01:57:53,519
you're further coddling the plant right

3420
01:57:51,840 --> 01:57:55,360
you're giving it everything it needs

3421
01:57:53,520 --> 01:57:56,480
you're making it an indoor plant and now

3422
01:57:55,359 --> 01:57:58,719
you've got a caudal

3423
01:57:56,479 --> 01:57:59,598
totally dependent little baby yeah yeah

3424
01:57:58,719 --> 01:58:01,840
yeah so

3425
01:57:59,599 --> 01:58:04,159
that's often this is why these these

3426
01:58:01,840 --> 01:58:06,159
plants are more susceptible i mean

3427
01:58:04,158 --> 01:58:09,198
there there's there's i told my wife

3428
01:58:06,158 --> 01:58:09,198
she's an indoor plant

3429
01:58:10,238 --> 01:58:15,359
she lives inside the brentwood bubble

3430
01:58:12,238 --> 01:58:17,198
yeah i mean you can see the difference

3431
01:58:15,359 --> 01:58:19,279
you can see the difference in indoor

3432
01:58:17,198 --> 01:58:20,960
grown plants versus outdoor grown plants

3433
01:58:19,279 --> 01:58:22,960
and their susceptibility to

3434
01:58:20,960 --> 01:58:25,279
certain things it's you know it's an

3435
01:58:22,960 --> 01:58:28,079
artificial these are cultivars that were

3436
01:58:25,279 --> 01:58:29,759
artificially produced right would they

3437
01:58:28,079 --> 01:58:31,920
do as well if you put them back out in

3438
01:58:29,760 --> 01:58:32,480
the wild probably not as well as their

3439
01:58:31,920 --> 01:58:35,679
you know

3440
01:58:32,479 --> 01:58:37,198
wild type relatives out there right run

3441
01:58:35,679 --> 01:58:39,760
free chihuahua

3442
01:58:37,198 --> 01:58:40,479
yeah exactly we ready to be tiny and

3443
01:58:39,760 --> 01:58:43,039
helpless

3444
01:58:40,479 --> 01:58:43,678
at one point that chihuahua was hunting

3445
01:58:43,039 --> 01:58:45,679
rabbit

3446
01:58:43,679 --> 01:58:48,399
right you know but also they've been

3447
01:58:45,679 --> 01:58:49,679
bred to have these extremely desirable

3448
01:58:48,399 --> 01:58:52,319
characteristics yeah

3449
01:58:49,679 --> 01:58:54,239
look the smell and other creatures are

3450
01:58:52,319 --> 01:58:56,238
equally as attractive

3451
01:58:54,238 --> 01:58:58,799
or even better i mean more attracted

3452
01:58:56,238 --> 01:59:01,759
it's uh you know there's there's a

3453
01:58:58,800 --> 01:59:02,000
what's starting to you know like come

3454
01:59:01,760 --> 01:59:04,079
out

3455
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:05,760
of a lot of you know the growers that

3456
01:59:04,079 --> 01:59:07,439
are paying attention is

3457
01:59:05,760 --> 01:59:09,280
is you know the susceptibility of

3458
01:59:07,439 --> 01:59:11,439
certain strains with certain

3459
01:59:09,279 --> 01:59:12,960
terpene profiles yeah i think i

3460
01:59:11,439 --> 01:59:15,439
mentioned this at the uh

3461
01:59:12,960 --> 01:59:16,000
it's high with one terpene it would it

3462
01:59:15,439 --> 01:59:18,799
potentially

3463
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:19,520
could attract a certain pest it could or

3464
01:59:18,800 --> 01:59:22,639
a certain

3465
01:59:19,520 --> 01:59:24,320
terpene profile represents a a plant

3466
01:59:22,639 --> 01:59:24,880
that's more susceptible not just to

3467
01:59:24,319 --> 01:59:27,840
insects

3468
01:59:24,880 --> 01:59:29,440
it represents a female to the male moth

3469
01:59:27,840 --> 01:59:30,880
i mean the breeze is picking up i can

3470
01:59:29,439 --> 01:59:34,000
totally smell them yeah

3471
01:59:30,880 --> 01:59:34,319
so we just don't know enough yet that's

3472
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,479
just

3473
01:59:34,319 --> 01:59:38,639
it is interesting like like terpene

3474
01:59:36,479 --> 01:59:39,359
profiles are kind of like frequencies

3475
01:59:38,639 --> 01:59:41,279
and at different

3476
01:59:39,359 --> 01:59:43,198
like for example the mod like are

3477
01:59:41,279 --> 01:59:45,279
pheromones with like

3478
01:59:43,198 --> 01:59:47,678
is it a smell which would imply it's a

3479
01:59:45,279 --> 01:59:49,118
terpene they're hormones

3480
01:59:47,679 --> 01:59:51,199
they're actually hormones that you and i

3481
01:59:49,118 --> 01:59:53,359
can't smell but the male moth can

3482
01:59:51,198 --> 01:59:54,319
but does that imply that it does have a

3483
01:59:53,359 --> 01:59:57,198
smell to

3484
01:59:54,319 --> 01:59:58,238
to him or is it a chemical that they say

3485
01:59:57,198 --> 01:59:59,919
it's a pheromone

3486
01:59:58,238 --> 02:00:01,759
it's a pheromone so it's not a smell

3487
01:59:59,920 --> 02:00:02,239
thing okay so it's not a terpene it's

3488
02:00:01,760 --> 02:00:04,400
like it's

3489
02:00:02,238 --> 02:00:06,638
but it's a in the same way you think

3490
02:00:04,399 --> 02:00:07,679
about terpenes with smell a pheromone is

3491
02:00:06,639 --> 02:00:09,520
to like a chemical

3492
02:00:07,679 --> 02:00:12,000
yeah i mean it could be that but let's

3493
02:00:09,520 --> 02:00:14,239
let's keep in mind that a lot of these

3494
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:15,359
trail with the ants so mods for example

3495
02:00:14,238 --> 02:00:19,039
let's just look at the single mop

3496
02:00:15,359 --> 02:00:22,079
mods and and what does the butterfly eat

3497
02:00:19,039 --> 02:00:24,719
well the the adult nectar and water

3498
02:00:22,079 --> 02:00:25,519
so would it make sense for nectar for

3499
02:00:24,719 --> 02:00:28,880
adult

3500
02:00:25,520 --> 02:00:31,920
flying moths and uh butterflies

3501
02:00:28,880 --> 02:00:33,440
which are nectar feeders to have the

3502
02:00:31,920 --> 02:00:37,440
ability to smell

3503
02:00:33,439 --> 02:00:38,079
flowers nectar find the nectar that way

3504
02:00:37,439 --> 02:00:40,879
i say yes

3505
02:00:38,079 --> 02:00:42,319
right but if you put like a gallon of

3506
02:00:40,880 --> 02:00:42,560
nectar in front of me i would probably

3507
02:00:42,319 --> 02:00:44,559
be

3508
02:00:42,560 --> 02:00:46,400
able to but what if they're not what if

3509
02:00:44,560 --> 02:00:47,920
they're not only focusing on nectar what

3510
02:00:46,399 --> 02:00:49,198
if they can smell

3511
02:00:47,920 --> 02:00:51,840
terpenes that those flowers are

3512
02:00:49,198 --> 02:00:54,879
producing wow and what if they prefer

3513
02:00:51,840 --> 02:00:55,840
a certain plant that produces a certain

3514
02:00:54,880 --> 02:00:58,319
flower that's right

3515
02:00:55,840 --> 02:01:00,079
so you could in breeding cultivars which

3516
02:00:58,319 --> 02:01:01,519
all kind of are going off and like the

3517
02:01:00,079 --> 02:01:02,479
berries and the desserts and the

3518
02:01:01,520 --> 02:01:06,800
whatever

3519
02:01:02,479 --> 02:01:07,839
but like you may cross paths with some

3520
02:01:06,800 --> 02:01:09,279
insect and you're

3521
02:01:07,840 --> 02:01:11,760
and the insect's like holy shit that's

3522
02:01:09,279 --> 02:01:13,519
my favorite smells good or maybe it

3523
02:01:11,760 --> 02:01:14,239
smells like something that you really

3524
02:01:13,520 --> 02:01:16,080
like

3525
02:01:14,238 --> 02:01:17,279
so it smells like it i mean limonene

3526
02:01:16,079 --> 02:01:19,920
what is limonene

3527
02:01:17,279 --> 02:01:22,000
it's a terpene that's in lemon in every

3528
02:01:19,920 --> 02:01:26,000
can in cannabis right but it's

3529
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:28,639
it's prominent in in limes and

3530
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:30,639
citrus fruits right it's one of the i

3531
02:01:28,639 --> 02:01:32,319
mean it smells like limes

3532
02:01:30,639 --> 02:01:34,239
that's why it's called limonene right it

3533
02:01:32,319 --> 02:01:37,279
smells lemony right

3534
02:01:34,238 --> 02:01:38,399
um could could that lemon smell be

3535
02:01:37,279 --> 02:01:42,079
something that attracts

3536
02:01:38,399 --> 02:01:45,118
a a a you know a a

3537
02:01:42,079 --> 02:01:47,118
citrus pest to the citrus trees

3538
02:01:45,118 --> 02:01:48,880
we just don't know is it it could be

3539
02:01:47,118 --> 02:01:51,279
right um

3540
02:01:48,880 --> 02:01:53,039
and if it is with more limonene attract

3541
02:01:51,279 --> 02:01:54,880
them to or a plant with more lime that

3542
02:01:53,039 --> 02:01:57,439
produces more limonene attract

3543
02:01:54,880 --> 02:01:59,279
that same pest i just you know and then

3544
02:01:57,439 --> 02:02:00,799
and that is the idea that they taste a

3545
02:01:59,279 --> 02:02:02,399
leaf that they've never tasted before

3546
02:02:00,800 --> 02:02:04,159
and are like i actually like this

3547
02:02:02,399 --> 02:02:06,079
yeah but this study is really important

3548
02:02:04,158 --> 02:02:08,879
to crop management and all of that

3549
02:02:06,079 --> 02:02:09,359
so is this type of research so get to it

3550
02:02:08,880 --> 02:02:12,400
so

3551
02:02:09,359 --> 02:02:13,279
okay so yeah well what are you doing

3552
02:02:12,399 --> 02:02:16,960
sitting here with us

3553
02:02:13,279 --> 02:02:18,880
getting high i'm not

3554
02:02:16,960 --> 02:02:20,158
part smoking your research yeah i mean

3555
02:02:18,880 --> 02:02:22,880
it's it is i mean

3556
02:02:20,158 --> 02:02:24,319
okay we work close with um a lot of

3557
02:02:22,880 --> 02:02:27,199
people that are in

3558
02:02:24,319 --> 02:02:29,118
the research side of it right um and um

3559
02:02:27,198 --> 02:02:30,879
you know so you mentioned steve as one

3560
02:02:29,118 --> 02:02:32,799
person he would be one easy

3561
02:02:30,880 --> 02:02:35,199
give me some other people um well you

3562
02:02:32,800 --> 02:02:36,400
know um uh we we know uh

3563
02:02:35,198 --> 02:02:38,319
people at you know different

3564
02:02:36,399 --> 02:02:40,479
universities that that are animals like

3565
02:02:38,319 --> 02:02:43,279
i would assume uc davis is very strong

3566
02:02:40,479 --> 02:02:43,919
uc davis is strong um are there any like

3567
02:02:43,279 --> 02:02:46,079
professors

3568
02:02:43,920 --> 02:02:46,960
cornell is also um there's a lot of

3569
02:02:46,079 --> 02:02:48,880
these these

3570
02:02:46,960 --> 02:02:51,198
these universities that you know we have

3571
02:02:48,880 --> 02:02:54,560
some contacts there i mean um

3572
02:02:51,198 --> 02:02:55,118
there was um the recent find of the

3573
02:02:54,560 --> 02:02:58,239
cannabis

3574
02:02:55,118 --> 02:03:00,719
aphid we up until it came to salinas we

3575
02:02:58,238 --> 02:03:04,158
weren't sure whether one specific

3576
02:03:00,719 --> 02:03:06,319
species of a wasp was capable of

3577
02:03:04,158 --> 02:03:08,079
parasitizing the aphid

3578
02:03:06,319 --> 02:03:10,319
until we were actually able to put them

3579
02:03:08,079 --> 02:03:13,679
together until we were actually able to

3580
02:03:10,319 --> 02:03:14,158
have some adult wasps emerge from a dead

3581
02:03:13,679 --> 02:03:16,480
aphid

3582
02:03:14,158 --> 02:03:18,719
and send it to an expert in that

3583
02:03:16,479 --> 02:03:21,519
particular family of wasps

3584
02:03:18,719 --> 02:03:22,960
in florida and they came back because

3585
02:03:21,520 --> 02:03:24,320
there was no one in california who had

3586
02:03:22,960 --> 02:03:26,560
that specific expertise

3587
02:03:24,319 --> 02:03:28,559
or maybe that's the only person we knew

3588
02:03:26,560 --> 02:03:30,480
who was an expert in bricant so they

3589
02:03:28,560 --> 02:03:32,080
they um well i didn't know them but i

3590
02:03:30,479 --> 02:03:34,079
was introduced to them we sent them

3591
02:03:32,079 --> 02:03:35,840
the emerged adults and they came back

3592
02:03:34,079 --> 02:03:38,079
and told us yes in fact it is this

3593
02:03:35,840 --> 02:03:39,360
wasp that is commercially produced from

3594
02:03:38,079 --> 02:03:40,800
us probably heard about it the

3595
02:03:39,359 --> 02:03:42,319
affidavits called money wasp

3596
02:03:40,800 --> 02:03:44,320
up until then we really weren't sure if

3597
02:03:42,319 --> 02:03:45,279
kalamani did do it so yeah the research

3598
02:03:44,319 --> 02:03:46,960
is ongoing

3599
02:03:45,279 --> 02:03:50,479
and that's when you guys were like we

3600
02:03:46,960 --> 02:03:52,480
got a new bug we're going to breathe

3601
02:03:50,479 --> 02:03:54,000
well when they get it they'll spend a

3602
02:03:52,479 --> 02:03:56,638
million dollars a day

3603
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:58,000
yeah research and that's what they'll do

3604
02:03:56,639 --> 02:04:00,239
and then they'll knock it out

3605
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:01,520
i found this yesterday as well which is

3606
02:04:00,238 --> 02:04:04,319
exciting

3607
02:04:01,520 --> 02:04:06,400
um you've got all sorts of violence see

3608
02:04:04,319 --> 02:04:10,479
that aphid right there it's black

3609
02:04:06,399 --> 02:04:13,598
yeah it's actually dead and it could be

3610
02:04:10,479 --> 02:04:15,359
it could be that uh it is one particular

3611
02:04:13,599 --> 02:04:17,679
species of wasp

3612
02:04:15,359 --> 02:04:19,279
that when it puts its egg in the aphid

3613
02:04:17,679 --> 02:04:21,840
the if it turns black

3614
02:04:19,279 --> 02:04:24,319
if it is we might have another weapon uh

3615
02:04:21,840 --> 02:04:25,119
so you may see a wasp emerge from there

3616
02:04:24,319 --> 02:04:26,559
like in the next

3617
02:04:25,118 --> 02:04:28,000
i collected it that's what i wanted to

3618
02:04:26,560 --> 02:04:28,800
do with the that's what i want to do

3619
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:30,319
with this i want to

3620
02:04:28,800 --> 02:04:32,000
cut it out and look underneath to see

3621
02:04:30,319 --> 02:04:33,759
what there is down there

3622
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:35,760
and you're like this may be a wasp that

3623
02:04:33,760 --> 02:04:37,760
we don't currently have in our lineup

3624
02:04:35,760 --> 02:04:39,199
i suspect it's one that is commercially

3625
02:04:37,760 --> 02:04:41,119
reared okay

3626
02:04:39,198 --> 02:04:43,039
um that's my suspicion he's dead right

3627
02:04:41,118 --> 02:04:44,399
there right that if it's dead yeah he's

3628
02:04:43,039 --> 02:04:46,158
dead but he's not dried up and he's

3629
02:04:44,399 --> 02:04:49,279
black and actually

3630
02:04:46,158 --> 02:04:50,158
it looks like the cannabis aphid it

3631
02:04:49,279 --> 02:04:53,759
could be

3632
02:04:50,158 --> 02:04:55,839
another aphid um but this grower had

3633
02:04:53,760 --> 02:04:58,000
the cannabis aphid that's about all they

3634
02:04:55,840 --> 02:04:58,880
had um and it doesn't look like the

3635
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:02,319
other black

3636
02:04:58,880 --> 02:05:04,078
colored aphid that i've seen um

3637
02:05:02,319 --> 02:05:05,359

3640
02:05:07,760 --> 02:05:11,039

3641
02:05:08,010 --> 02:05:14,639

02:05:26,238 --> 02:05:28,959
crew

3649
02:05:26,880 --> 02:05:30,078

02:05:36,560 --> 02:05:39,440

02:05:38,078 --> 02:05:41,439
i could send you actually i have a

3655
02:05:39,439 --> 02:05:42,799
picture of it on my uh leaf hoppers are

3656
02:05:41,439 --> 02:05:44,638
interesting we were just talking about

3657
02:05:42,800 --> 02:05:48,400
beat curly top virus right

3658
02:05:44,639 --> 02:05:49,599
yeah last week um now a reason to start

3659
02:05:48,399 --> 02:05:50,960
really thinking about

3660
02:05:49,599 --> 02:05:53,199
whether or not leaf hopper is going to

3661
02:05:50,960 --> 02:05:55,279
be a pest of cannabis

3662
02:05:53,198 --> 02:05:56,799
because it we had them it's what

3663
02:05:55,279 --> 02:05:59,039
transmits that virus

3664
02:05:56,800 --> 02:06:00,400
but yeah and by the way we had them too

3665
02:05:59,039 --> 02:06:02,000
and that's when we had we had like the

3666
02:06:00,399 --> 02:06:03,679
praying mantis were like what's

3667
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:05,920
up this place is amazing so you can

3668
02:06:03,679 --> 02:06:06,880
imagine a situation uh where a farm is

3669
02:06:05,920 --> 02:06:11,039
infested with

3670
02:06:06,880 --> 02:06:13,279
uh the beet curly top virus and uh those

3671
02:06:11,039 --> 02:06:14,399
that's being transmitted uh within the

3672
02:06:13,279 --> 02:06:17,679
farm by a

3673
02:06:14,399 --> 02:06:18,879
a leaf hopper and that somebody decides

3674
02:06:17,679 --> 02:06:21,039
to put a farm of

3675
02:06:18,880 --> 02:06:22,239
of hemp right like in the same way that

3676
02:06:21,039 --> 02:06:24,639
a mosquito

3677
02:06:22,238 --> 02:06:26,959
transmits from canada okay got it got it

3678
02:06:24,639 --> 02:06:29,599
it's it's exactly that it's maybe

3679
02:06:26,960 --> 02:06:31,198
the virus has been around forever and

3680
02:06:29,599 --> 02:06:33,279
the leaf hopper's been around forever

3681
02:06:31,198 --> 02:06:36,399
but it wasn't until you put

3682
02:06:33,279 --> 02:06:38,399
the virus that got into the

3683
02:06:36,399 --> 02:06:40,238
plant that the leaf hopper was feeding

3684
02:06:38,399 --> 02:06:42,638
on you know what i never

3685
02:06:40,238 --> 02:06:45,519
posted a picture of it i posted a

3686
02:06:42,639 --> 02:06:48,560
picture of a different one from home

3687
02:06:45,520 --> 02:06:52,320
leaf hoppers this one was uh yeah

3688
02:06:48,560 --> 02:06:54,880
um i was like you're kind of cute

3689
02:06:52,319 --> 02:06:56,960
yeah there's a but no yeah that reminds

3690
02:06:54,880 --> 02:07:00,239
me

3691
02:06:56,960 --> 02:07:03,760
it's beat curly top virus it's uh well

3692
02:07:00,238 --> 02:07:07,118
um it makes the tops of beats curly

3693
02:07:03,760 --> 02:07:09,599
oh okay yeah

3694
02:07:07,118 --> 02:07:10,479
it's it was it was found in b just like

3695
02:07:09,599 --> 02:07:12,560
the name says

3696
02:07:10,479 --> 02:07:14,319
i guess and that's where they came up

3697
02:07:12,560 --> 02:07:14,880
with the name be curly top virus we're

3698
02:07:14,319 --> 02:07:17,840
very

3699
02:07:14,880 --> 02:07:18,800
literal in the naming of uh pests of

3700
02:07:17,840 --> 02:07:21,760
insects and

3701
02:07:18,800 --> 02:07:23,039
uh tomato spotted wilt virus what do you

3702
02:07:21,760 --> 02:07:26,159
think it does

3703
02:07:23,039 --> 02:07:28,880
right so but yeah but it's not

3704
02:07:26,158 --> 02:07:30,399
exclusive to beats it has other hosts um

3705
02:07:28,880 --> 02:07:34,960
apparently now

3706
02:07:30,399 --> 02:07:34,960
cannabis or hemp is a host nice

3707
02:07:36,479 --> 02:07:40,238
plain that thing is cool looks like it's

3708
02:07:39,359 --> 02:07:42,319
made of wood

3709
02:07:40,238 --> 02:07:44,000
it's probably it's like a wood plane

3710
02:07:42,319 --> 02:07:44,719
right for the wildfires maybe i don't

3711
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:47,439
know

3712
02:07:44,719 --> 02:07:49,118
now that seems more like a vintage like

3713
02:07:47,439 --> 02:07:53,359
yeah

3714
02:07:49,118 --> 02:07:56,078
all right well let's uh that's a strong

3715
02:07:53,359 --> 02:07:57,679
yes strong ending tom's mind's blown he

3716
02:07:56,078 --> 02:07:59,599
has a lot to think about

3717
02:07:57,679 --> 02:08:01,359
that's right in the next season we'll

3718
02:07:59,599 --> 02:08:03,679
develop a game plan

3719
02:08:01,359 --> 02:08:04,399
right well hey you know you know i i

3720
02:08:03,679 --> 02:08:06,639
didn't know you

3721
02:08:04,399 --> 02:08:08,238
we'll start this we'll take this disease

3722
02:08:06,639 --> 02:08:09,440
now you know him intimately do you feel

3723
02:08:08,238 --> 02:08:13,598
like that kind of like

3724
02:08:09,439 --> 02:08:15,839
uh like you get to come and intimately

3725
02:08:13,599 --> 02:08:17,279
evaluate people's gardens like their

3726
02:08:15,840 --> 02:08:18,560
grow operations essentially yeah that's

3727
02:08:17,279 --> 02:08:20,238
my job they're basically burying

3728
02:08:18,560 --> 02:08:21,599
themselves

3729
02:08:20,238 --> 02:08:23,598
that's why i don't mention names of

3730
02:08:21,599 --> 02:08:24,400
people i work with right i don't want to

3731
02:08:23,599 --> 02:08:26,159
tell anyone

3732
02:08:24,399 --> 02:08:29,118
where whoever who i might be selling

3733
02:08:26,158 --> 02:08:30,000
bugs to so this specific grower had this

3734
02:08:29,118 --> 02:08:32,399
dessert yeah that's

3735
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:33,679
the way it was terrible yeah this grower

3736
02:08:32,399 --> 02:08:35,839
and selena

3737
02:08:33,679 --> 02:08:38,319
i wouldn't buy their weed in a shop yeah

3738
02:08:35,840 --> 02:08:40,960
exactly it's like no that's uh

3739
02:08:38,319 --> 02:08:41,759
yeah there's no reason to mention anyone

3740
02:08:40,960 --> 02:08:44,639
under the bus

3741
02:08:41,760 --> 02:08:45,199
yeah everyone has them i mean every one

3742
02:08:44,639 --> 02:08:47,440
time you're

3743
02:08:45,198 --> 02:08:48,319
burying everyone else's thousands of

3744
02:08:47,439 --> 02:08:50,960
people right now

3745
02:08:48,319 --> 02:08:51,920
so you're very brave yeah i mean but

3746
02:08:50,960 --> 02:08:53,439
then again there's

3747
02:08:51,920 --> 02:08:55,199
there's a reason for this right you're

3748
02:08:53,439 --> 02:08:57,039
learning you learn through you know now

3749
02:08:55,198 --> 02:09:00,158
you have one more strategy but

3750
02:08:57,039 --> 02:09:02,639
hey you know we didn't know each other

3751
02:09:00,158 --> 02:09:04,078
we were sacrificing you to teach others

3752
02:09:02,639 --> 02:09:06,719
for the perspective

3753
02:09:04,078 --> 02:09:08,639
like my perspective it will always be a

3754
02:09:06,719 --> 02:09:11,198
non-commercial perspective

3755
02:09:08,639 --> 02:09:11,760
that's not what this is about so you

3756
02:09:11,198 --> 02:09:14,399
know

3757
02:09:11,760 --> 02:09:16,800
so everything is considered from a home

3758
02:09:14,399 --> 02:09:18,238
grow point of view into the cost what

3759
02:09:16,800 --> 02:09:20,239
i'm going to do how can i

3760
02:09:18,238 --> 02:09:21,919
protect this and that doesn't mean the

3761
02:09:20,238 --> 02:09:24,238
grief isn't you know

3762
02:09:21,920 --> 02:09:26,158
this is real you know in the sense of

3763
02:09:24,238 --> 02:09:26,559
the grief israel and the time and all of

3764
02:09:26,158 --> 02:09:28,638
that

3765
02:09:26,560 --> 02:09:30,000
but you know whether that changes your

3766
02:09:28,639 --> 02:09:32,400
decisions

3767
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:33,118
maybe not because the lessons are still

3768
02:09:32,399 --> 02:09:36,559
the same

3769
02:09:33,118 --> 02:09:39,118
you know uh you have to you have to

3770
02:09:36,560 --> 02:09:41,039
be vigilant from the beginning the

3771
02:09:39,118 --> 02:09:42,960
question for me has always been is there

3772
02:09:41,039 --> 02:09:45,519
something i can do even before all

3773
02:09:42,960 --> 02:09:46,158
oh yeah like preventative you know yeah

3774
02:09:45,520 --> 02:09:49,520
what

3775
02:09:46,158 --> 02:09:51,198
so i'm not a bio control specialist

3776
02:09:49,520 --> 02:09:52,880
although i i know a bit about bio

3777
02:09:51,198 --> 02:09:54,319
control i'm an ipm

3778
02:09:52,880 --> 02:09:56,159
specialist and that stands for

3779
02:09:54,319 --> 02:09:57,039
integrated pest management the keywords

3780
02:09:56,158 --> 02:09:59,198
integrated

3781
02:09:57,039 --> 02:10:00,719
it means one not one strategy like one

3782
02:09:59,198 --> 02:10:02,960
of my props used to say

3783
02:10:00,719 --> 02:10:04,399
all right if you had a boxer come out if

3784
02:10:02,960 --> 02:10:06,239
you had mike tyson come out and all he

3785
02:10:04,399 --> 02:10:08,799
knew how to do was throw an uppercut

3786
02:10:06,238 --> 02:10:09,439
it wouldn't take long before his his

3787
02:10:08,800 --> 02:10:11,440
fighter knew

3788
02:10:09,439 --> 02:10:13,598
the fight so that is the killer punch

3789
02:10:11,439 --> 02:10:14,960
and punch-out it is his killer punch but

3790
02:10:13,599 --> 02:10:15,599
he but he's also throwing everything

3791
02:10:14,960 --> 02:10:17,279
else at you

3792
02:10:15,599 --> 02:10:18,880
but if all he did is that the one where

3793
02:10:17,279 --> 02:10:21,118
it's like left left right right

3794
02:10:18,880 --> 02:10:22,800
i i never played i never played it and i

3795
02:10:21,118 --> 02:10:23,759
i think i did once and then and he

3796
02:10:22,800 --> 02:10:25,360
killed me like

3797
02:10:23,760 --> 02:10:27,440
in the first round and then i stopped

3798
02:10:25,359 --> 02:10:28,880
but um

3799
02:10:27,439 --> 02:10:30,638
but let's say all he did was come out

3800
02:10:28,880 --> 02:10:31,118
with an uppercut and he just like wound

3801
02:10:30,639 --> 02:10:33,840
himself

3802
02:10:31,118 --> 02:10:34,639
up soon you'd know how to how to defeat

3803
02:10:33,840 --> 02:10:36,078
him right

3804
02:10:34,639 --> 02:10:37,679
it's the same idea you got to use

3805
02:10:36,078 --> 02:10:40,078
everything you got to use right crosses

3806
02:10:37,679 --> 02:10:41,520
jabs the pests are like we saw that

3807
02:10:40,078 --> 02:10:42,319
strategy last year you're not going to

3808
02:10:41,520 --> 02:10:43,520
fool us again

3809
02:10:42,319 --> 02:10:45,519
yeah you just have to throw everything

3810
02:10:43,520 --> 02:10:47,040
at them so there's so there's all kinds

3811
02:10:45,520 --> 02:10:48,800
of it's not just about

3812
02:10:47,039 --> 02:10:50,880
when we talk about pesticides and when

3813
02:10:48,800 --> 02:10:51,760
we talk about biological control we're

3814
02:10:50,880 --> 02:10:55,118
talking about

3815
02:10:51,760 --> 02:10:57,840
one arm one strategy in ipm

3816
02:10:55,118 --> 02:10:58,479
that's the eradication strategy that's

3817
02:10:57,840 --> 02:11:00,639
kill it

3818
02:10:58,479 --> 02:11:01,598
that's the last thing you do believe it

3819
02:11:00,639 --> 02:11:03,679
or not that's a

3820
02:11:01,599 --> 02:11:04,719
that's like your last straw kill it

3821
02:11:03,679 --> 02:11:06,399
right you know

3822
02:11:04,719 --> 02:11:07,920
you have things like keep them out of

3823
02:11:06,399 --> 02:11:10,399
the ground how do you do that

3824
02:11:07,920 --> 02:11:11,920
or under control select select strains

3825
02:11:10,399 --> 02:11:14,000
that are more resistant right

3826
02:11:11,920 --> 02:11:15,279
right how what about hitting their life

3827
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:17,279
cycle something that

3828
02:11:15,279 --> 02:11:18,719
you know the disease triangle we talked

3829
02:11:17,279 --> 02:11:20,238
about that yeah you can think of

3830
02:11:18,719 --> 02:11:21,359
strategies right off the bat we talked

3831
02:11:20,238 --> 02:11:23,118
about strategies

3832
02:11:21,359 --> 02:11:24,960
if you control the if you control the

3833
02:11:23,118 --> 02:11:26,399
caterpillar you make it less susceptible

3834
02:11:24,960 --> 02:11:27,279
to the disease because there's less

3835
02:11:26,399 --> 02:11:30,319
injury

3836
02:11:27,279 --> 02:11:32,319
right so there's all these it's a myriad

3837
02:11:30,319 --> 02:11:34,559
it's going to become a black belt in the

3838
02:11:32,319 --> 02:11:36,078
understanding of the disease triangle

3839
02:11:34,560 --> 02:11:37,920
well it you know it takes a lot of

3840
02:11:36,078 --> 02:11:39,279
reading and time and but to think

3841
02:11:37,920 --> 02:11:41,039
thinking about it but you know that's

3842
02:11:39,279 --> 02:11:43,920
kind of my job is

3843
02:11:41,039 --> 02:11:44,719
you know design a program that is you

3844
02:11:43,920 --> 02:11:47,118
know more

3845
02:11:44,719 --> 02:11:49,039
bio-intensive in other words trying to

3846
02:11:47,118 --> 02:11:51,039
work around bio control

3847
02:11:49,039 --> 02:11:53,679
so that we can reduce or eliminate

3848
02:11:51,039 --> 02:11:54,158
sprays but at the same time integrate as

3849
02:11:53,679 --> 02:11:56,319
many

3850
02:11:54,158 --> 02:11:57,839
strategies as i can think of and it also

3851
02:11:56,319 --> 02:11:59,679
again coming back if you're dealing with

3852
02:11:57,840 --> 02:12:00,078
commercial grows these are grows that

3853
02:11:59,679 --> 02:12:02,639
will

3854
02:12:00,078 --> 02:12:04,880
have different strains in in different

3855
02:12:02,639 --> 02:12:07,359
you know seasons and all of that so

3856
02:12:04,880 --> 02:12:09,840
but i assume that what they don't want

3857
02:12:07,359 --> 02:12:13,519
is to have to fight the same battle

3858
02:12:09,840 --> 02:12:15,360
year after year or face

3859
02:12:13,520 --> 02:12:17,040
i mean i guess this is just the

3860
02:12:15,359 --> 02:12:20,158
challenge of agriculture

3861
02:12:17,039 --> 02:12:23,760
anyway yeah yep so

3862
02:12:20,158 --> 02:12:25,839
um it just seems that that the cannabis

3863
02:12:23,760 --> 02:12:28,719
in particular which is not only now

3864
02:12:25,840 --> 02:12:29,599
really starting to scale up is dealing

3865
02:12:28,719 --> 02:12:32,719
with these

3866
02:12:29,599 --> 02:12:35,360
issues on truly commercial scale

3867
02:12:32,719 --> 02:12:36,078
you got it and um there are things we're

3868
02:12:35,359 --> 02:12:38,319
doing

3869
02:12:36,078 --> 02:12:39,679
that are good and they're probably more

3870
02:12:38,319 --> 02:12:42,960
things we're doing that

3871
02:12:39,679 --> 02:12:44,800
are bad it's um it took a couple of

3872
02:12:42,960 --> 02:12:47,599
years before the cannabis safe it really

3873
02:12:44,800 --> 02:12:49,599
became a problem in salinas from when i

3874
02:12:47,599 --> 02:12:50,480
first was it on a different plant like

3875
02:12:49,599 --> 02:12:52,078
do people know

3876
02:12:50,479 --> 02:12:53,519
like it came from this or it just came

3877
02:12:52,078 --> 02:12:57,118
out of nowhere no

3878
02:12:53,520 --> 02:12:59,520
it's uh um i mean obviously the name

3879
02:12:57,118 --> 02:13:02,399
implies i talked a bit about it on that

3880
02:12:59,520 --> 02:13:04,480
last sunday right remember totally

3881
02:13:02,399 --> 02:13:05,759
the whole time ford on the the totally

3882
02:13:04,479 --> 02:13:07,439
honest david's a g

3883
02:13:05,760 --> 02:13:09,039
in the genus ford on and it has a

3884
02:13:07,439 --> 02:13:11,919
relative that's very

3885
02:13:09,039 --> 02:13:12,880
closely related to it which is the hops

3886
02:13:11,920 --> 02:13:15,599
aphid

3887
02:13:12,880 --> 02:13:16,000
hops and hemp are related so the pests

3888
02:13:15,599 --> 02:13:18,400
that feed

3889
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:19,359
on them happen to also be related so is

3890
02:13:18,399 --> 02:13:21,359
it

3891
02:13:19,359 --> 02:13:23,198
is it outside the realm of possibility

3892
02:13:21,359 --> 02:13:26,000
that the hop safe it can

3893
02:13:23,198 --> 02:13:27,279
host on cannabis and vice versa is it

3894
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:30,800
outside that like

3895
02:13:27,279 --> 02:13:33,118
it did a neanderthal like diverging to

3896
02:13:30,800 --> 02:13:34,560
what are we homing what are we we're

3897
02:13:33,118 --> 02:13:37,759
hominids hominids

3898
02:13:34,560 --> 02:13:40,880
anderson was dominant too but but it but

3899
02:13:37,760 --> 02:13:42,719
we're not neanderthals so my point is

3900
02:13:40,880 --> 02:13:45,599
do you think maybe in a short period of

3901
02:13:42,719 --> 02:13:48,560
time the hop aphid like

3902
02:13:45,599 --> 02:13:49,840
like diverged like well no they're

3903
02:13:48,560 --> 02:13:50,880
they're they're they are clearly

3904
02:13:49,840 --> 02:13:52,719
different species

3905
02:13:50,880 --> 02:13:54,719
right we don't know and we don't have

3906
02:13:52,719 --> 02:13:55,520
one point like a million years ago or

3907
02:13:54,719 --> 02:13:58,399
even a thousand

3908
02:13:55,520 --> 02:14:00,239
like because bugs recycles like they

3909
02:13:58,399 --> 02:14:00,719
they have so many cycles yeah in the in

3910
02:14:00,238 --> 02:14:03,279
a year

3911
02:14:00,719 --> 02:14:05,118
versus us i don't know how many foradon

3912
02:14:03,279 --> 02:14:05,840
aphid there are out there but it is a

3913
02:14:05,118 --> 02:14:08,238
family

3914
02:14:05,840 --> 02:14:08,960
of aphid and so they're they're related

3915
02:14:08,238 --> 02:14:12,559
in some of their

3916
02:14:08,960 --> 02:14:15,279
genetics didn't they recently find um

3917
02:14:12,560 --> 02:14:16,000
like amber of and i want to say

3918
02:14:15,279 --> 02:14:19,920
something like

3919
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:20,238
uh why wasn't it did you see some giant

3920
02:14:19,920 --> 02:14:23,199
news

3921
02:14:20,238 --> 02:14:23,598
in the past of of what i think it was a

3922
02:14:23,198 --> 02:14:25,839
fly

3923
02:14:23,599 --> 02:14:26,960
insect right wasn't it it was a sperm of

3924
02:14:25,840 --> 02:14:28,719
an insect right

3925
02:14:26,960 --> 02:14:30,000
and it was i think it was still stuck to

3926
02:14:28,719 --> 02:14:32,880
the female i think

3927
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:34,319
she i think that she could so does that

3928
02:14:32,880 --> 02:14:35,520
mean that they could design she was

3929
02:14:34,319 --> 02:14:36,559
inseminated and

3930
02:14:35,520 --> 02:14:38,639
but what does that mean could they

3931
02:14:36,560 --> 02:14:41,280
recreate that fly

3932
02:14:38,639 --> 02:14:43,359
like in vitro at this point the

3933
02:14:41,279 --> 02:14:43,840
technology is not there yet as far as i

3934
02:14:43,359 --> 02:14:46,238
know

3935
02:14:43,840 --> 02:14:48,319
you know um oh sure it's there like a a

3936
02:14:46,238 --> 02:14:51,359
prehistoric flight yeah i was here

3937
02:14:48,319 --> 02:14:53,840
it's probably like this big

3938
02:14:51,359 --> 02:14:54,960
no but you know it's firm inside is it

3939
02:14:53,840 --> 02:14:57,760
possible that

3940
02:14:54,960 --> 02:14:58,960
the hop safe it can can is it is it

3941
02:14:57,760 --> 02:15:00,880
possible that the hops

3942
02:14:58,960 --> 02:15:02,560
aphid can bring hopslate and vira to

3943
02:15:00,880 --> 02:15:06,159
cannabis well definitely because

3944
02:15:02,560 --> 02:15:07,840
basically if you like beer you like weed

3945
02:15:06,158 --> 02:15:09,039
and everybody by the way this is our

3946
02:15:07,840 --> 02:15:11,520
tom's expert opinion

3947
02:15:09,039 --> 02:15:12,639
[Laughter]

3948
02:15:11,520 --> 02:15:14,960
what about those of us who like

3949
02:15:12,639 --> 02:15:16,639
disclaimer well

3950
02:15:14,960 --> 02:15:18,319
tom is not an expert you can like weed

3951
02:15:16,639 --> 02:15:20,159
too you like weed too yeah

3952
02:15:18,319 --> 02:15:22,158
beer and buds and we didn't want if i

3953
02:15:20,158 --> 02:15:24,000
liked hot yeah i do like beer and i do

3954
02:15:22,158 --> 02:15:26,000
like weed so

3955
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:28,238
yeah so i am like these so that but the

3956
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:31,520
cannabis safe it's known

3957
02:15:28,238 --> 02:15:32,559
only to host on um on the cannabis

3958
02:15:31,520 --> 02:15:34,480
although you know

3959
02:15:32,560 --> 02:15:35,679
it obviously has to follow some some

3960
02:15:34,479 --> 02:15:38,559
somewhat of the lifestyle

3961
02:15:35,679 --> 02:15:39,039
life cycle of like the hop safid which

3962
02:15:38,560 --> 02:15:43,679
goes

3963
02:15:39,039 --> 02:15:47,039
which hosts between cannabis and

3964
02:15:43,679 --> 02:15:48,880
um stone fruit prunus prunus species

3965
02:15:47,039 --> 02:15:50,800
okay but sorry before cannabis was

3966
02:15:48,880 --> 02:15:52,480
around the hops aphid was going

3967
02:15:50,800 --> 02:15:54,880
obviously hops are grown all over i mean

3968
02:15:52,479 --> 02:15:58,078
not all over but like

3969
02:15:54,880 --> 02:16:00,159
where what's the other one dragon what

3970
02:15:58,078 --> 02:16:01,599
uh the the you're talking about the

3971
02:16:00,158 --> 02:16:04,638
trees that no no

3972
02:16:01,599 --> 02:16:06,639
you mentioned another yeah like prunes

3973
02:16:04,639 --> 02:16:08,319
and peaches and all that

3974
02:16:06,639 --> 02:16:10,239
okay that's the definition and it hosts

3975
02:16:08,319 --> 02:16:10,960
on on both yeah because it's got the so

3976
02:16:10,238 --> 02:16:13,359
when there are no

3977
02:16:10,960 --> 02:16:14,158
hops fields around it's like i'll hang

3978
02:16:13,359 --> 02:16:16,399
out on the

3979
02:16:14,158 --> 02:16:18,000
peaches you know i still don't

3980
02:16:16,399 --> 02:16:20,879
understand it although i do know

3981
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:21,920
that it will can overwinter basically

3982
02:16:20,880 --> 02:16:24,560
feed and

3983
02:16:21,920 --> 02:16:25,118
actually also you know believe it can it

3984
02:16:24,560 --> 02:16:27,840
can

3985
02:16:25,118 --> 02:16:28,799
you know reproduce on prunus you know

3986
02:16:27,840 --> 02:16:32,079
like

3987
02:16:28,800 --> 02:16:33,040
the stone fruit and then back to hemp or

3988
02:16:32,079 --> 02:16:34,799
hops

3989
02:16:33,040 --> 02:16:36,080
you know we i'm not sure about this

3990
02:16:34,799 --> 02:16:39,119
aphid whether whether

3991
02:16:36,079 --> 02:16:41,519
eliminating and there is no way yet but

3992
02:16:39,120 --> 02:16:42,240
eliminating all the prunus trees in the

3993
02:16:41,519 --> 02:16:44,880
area will

3994
02:16:42,239 --> 02:16:45,280
just break its ability to overwinter and

3995
02:16:44,879 --> 02:16:47,518
then

3996
02:16:45,280 --> 02:16:49,040
help with control i i don't know oh

3997
02:16:47,519 --> 02:16:51,599
because hops die at the end of the

3998
02:16:49,040 --> 02:16:54,080
season and those trees linger on

3999
02:16:51,599 --> 02:16:55,040
and it's in temperate climate like do

4000
02:16:54,079 --> 02:16:57,439
those trees mo

4001
02:16:55,040 --> 02:17:00,399
like let's say i assume they grow well

4002
02:16:57,439 --> 02:17:02,000
in like the central coast

4003
02:17:00,398 --> 02:17:03,760
do they lose their leaves in the winter

4004
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:06,718
are they just going full year

4005
02:17:03,760 --> 02:17:08,159
you know it's um it's it's even just it

4006
02:17:06,718 --> 02:17:09,839
doesn't necessarily have to feed on

4007
02:17:08,159 --> 02:17:12,159
leaves right it could be feeding on

4008
02:17:09,840 --> 02:17:12,880
on branch tissue or something you know i

4009
02:17:12,159 --> 02:17:14,239
don't

4010
02:17:12,879 --> 02:17:16,398
a lot of aphids when they overwinter

4011
02:17:14,239 --> 02:17:17,119
will overwinter on a naked tree that's

4012
02:17:16,398 --> 02:17:19,840
you know in

4013
02:17:17,120 --> 02:17:21,679
in the bark or you know um how about in

4014
02:17:19,840 --> 02:17:22,478
cold environments like i grew up in new

4015
02:17:21,679 --> 02:17:24,799
england

4016
02:17:22,478 --> 02:17:26,558
yeah i mean because here it's like like

4017
02:17:24,799 --> 02:17:28,558
if you survive all year long in

4018
02:17:26,558 --> 02:17:30,000
l.a where did prune where did prune

4019
02:17:28,558 --> 02:17:30,558
trees come from originally yeah you know

4020
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:33,920
i haven't

4021
02:17:30,558 --> 02:17:37,438
researched it but um at some point they

4022
02:17:33,920 --> 02:17:38,239
bred them to grow in different climates

4023
02:17:37,439 --> 02:17:40,880
right

4024
02:17:38,239 --> 02:17:42,318
in iran so they were bred to grow in

4025
02:17:40,879 --> 02:17:45,199
different climates and

4026
02:17:42,318 --> 02:17:46,638
that you know if there could be you know

4027
02:17:45,200 --> 02:17:48,000
there could be a prune that grows here

4028
02:17:46,638 --> 02:17:50,000
prune a species that grows here that

4029
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:53,679
doesn't back yeast and

4030
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:55,359
vice versa yeah this is very interesting

4031
02:17:53,679 --> 02:17:58,079
i mean i think have you dealt with a lot

4032
02:17:55,359 --> 02:18:00,559
of any these large grows where the

4033
02:17:58,079 --> 02:18:01,519
farmers transitioned over to hemp from

4034
02:18:00,558 --> 02:18:04,959
other crops

4035
02:18:01,519 --> 02:18:06,318
and so yeah so you know

4036
02:18:04,959 --> 02:18:09,438
because we've been hearing about this

4037
02:18:06,318 --> 02:18:11,199
for for years you know large growth and

4038
02:18:09,439 --> 02:18:12,639
a lot of them didn't make it they kind

4039
02:18:11,200 --> 02:18:13,679
of didn't know what they were doing they

4040
02:18:12,638 --> 02:18:15,438
didn't know what they were going to do

4041
02:18:13,679 --> 02:18:16,000
with their crops after they harvested

4042
02:18:15,439 --> 02:18:17,840
them

4043
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:20,000
but now there's this other component

4044
02:18:17,840 --> 02:18:21,359
where did they know what pests they were

4045
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:23,679
up against with this

4046
02:18:21,359 --> 02:18:24,800
with these brand new crops and and and

4047
02:18:23,679 --> 02:18:26,879
all of that

4048
02:18:24,799 --> 02:18:28,478
yeah now you you to grow something

4049
02:18:26,879 --> 02:18:29,598
completely new there's definitely i mean

4050
02:18:28,478 --> 02:18:32,159
the the blueberry

4051
02:18:29,599 --> 02:18:34,719
farmer up i think in washington state uh

4052
02:18:32,159 --> 02:18:38,318
i talked to a couple months ago

4053
02:18:34,718 --> 02:18:39,598
he then grew hemp at scale and he was

4054
02:18:38,318 --> 02:18:41,519
like my first season

4055
02:18:39,599 --> 02:18:42,719
and he's like a world-class blueberry

4056
02:18:41,519 --> 02:18:46,079
farmer

4057
02:18:42,718 --> 02:18:47,119
um and he was like it just slapped me

4058
02:18:46,079 --> 02:18:49,200
around

4059
02:18:47,120 --> 02:18:50,960
yeah i mean if you're not ready for it

4060
02:18:49,200 --> 02:18:53,120
you know it's like anyone you know

4061
02:18:50,959 --> 02:18:54,478
there's a there's a uh a learning curve

4062
02:18:53,120 --> 02:18:56,880
for every crop

4063
02:18:54,478 --> 02:18:58,959
there are some easy crops to grow how

4064
02:18:56,879 --> 02:19:00,959
would you like go away from a crop you

4065
02:18:58,959 --> 02:19:02,398
know blueberry go oh here's this new one

4066
02:19:00,959 --> 02:19:05,438
i'm gonna make a killing

4067
02:19:02,398 --> 02:19:06,159
and you know i i don't understand the

4068
02:19:05,439 --> 02:19:08,559
mentality

4069
02:19:06,159 --> 02:19:10,239
because here's like a smart person how

4070
02:19:08,558 --> 02:19:10,799
could you not even how could you do that

4071
02:19:10,239 --> 02:19:14,318
and not

4072
02:19:10,799 --> 02:19:17,920
do your bottom line research

4073
02:19:14,318 --> 02:19:20,000
you know again there's

4074
02:19:17,920 --> 02:19:21,200
the bottom line research isn't there um

4075
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:22,718
you have to remember

4076
02:19:21,200 --> 02:19:24,319
and then if it's not there then you're

4077
02:19:22,718 --> 02:19:26,239
taking a real challenge

4078
02:19:24,318 --> 02:19:27,599
yeah well it's like all the people who

4079
02:19:26,239 --> 02:19:29,039
are growing hemp and then we're like

4080
02:19:27,599 --> 02:19:30,558
shit i have nowhere to store all this

4081
02:19:29,040 --> 02:19:32,000
stuff once i cut it down what we were

4082
02:19:30,558 --> 02:19:33,438
saying they didn't they didn't know

4083
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:35,040
where they're gonna store it they didn't

4084
02:19:33,439 --> 02:19:36,398
know how to cure it they didn't know how

4085
02:19:35,040 --> 02:19:38,080
to then manufacture you have to

4086
02:19:36,398 --> 02:19:39,679
try and cure this if you want to sell

4087
02:19:38,079 --> 02:19:40,959
the flower why would you make that

4088
02:19:39,679 --> 02:19:43,760
investment if you don't know

4089
02:19:40,959 --> 02:19:46,079
could it be could it be that the

4090
02:19:43,760 --> 02:19:47,840
investor for the cannabis operation

4091
02:19:46,079 --> 02:19:49,359
is a different animal altogether could

4092
02:19:47,840 --> 02:19:50,559
it be that somebody that wants to switch

4093
02:19:49,359 --> 02:19:54,559
let's say from

4094
02:19:50,559 --> 02:19:56,159
ornamental flower production to cannabis

4095
02:19:54,559 --> 02:19:58,318
here we're talking about the people who

4096
02:19:56,159 --> 02:20:00,159
are doing hemp farms at scale

4097
02:19:58,318 --> 02:20:02,079
like not cannabis but like well same

4098
02:20:00,159 --> 02:20:04,879
same deal um but it's

4099
02:20:02,079 --> 02:20:06,318
such a bigger scale of like what you've

4100
02:20:04,879 --> 02:20:08,639
never done this before

4101
02:20:06,318 --> 02:20:10,239
and you haven't thought out like and you

4102
02:20:08,639 --> 02:20:11,358
didn't bring someone in who knows what

4103
02:20:10,239 --> 02:20:13,280
they're doing

4104
02:20:11,359 --> 02:20:15,600
but but see so that's what i was getting

4105
02:20:13,280 --> 02:20:18,000
at is you have it the chance of success

4106
02:20:15,600 --> 02:20:19,920
for somebody that has grown another crop

4107
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:21,600
and has done it for years and

4108
02:20:19,920 --> 02:20:23,359
understands everything that goes into

4109
02:20:21,600 --> 02:20:25,040
the business of farming

4110
02:20:23,359 --> 02:20:26,479
having success with hemp i think is

4111
02:20:25,040 --> 02:20:28,720
greater than you know some

4112
02:20:26,478 --> 02:20:31,840
somebody that's just investing to try to

4113
02:20:28,719 --> 02:20:31,840
oh 100

4114
02:20:36,478 --> 02:20:39,599
is that there's a body of knowledge

4115
02:20:38,719 --> 02:20:41,920
unique to

4116
02:20:39,600 --> 02:20:44,000
every different thing that you grow that

4117
02:20:41,920 --> 02:20:46,960
you know if you're not aware of it'll

4118
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:47,920
fight you know yeah absolutely on the

4119
02:20:46,959 --> 02:20:50,799
pest side

4120
02:20:47,920 --> 02:20:51,200
i i ten i focus on cannabis i've i've

4121
02:20:50,799 --> 02:20:53,279
had

4122
02:20:51,200 --> 02:20:55,280
what three years now just almost

4123
02:20:53,280 --> 02:20:55,760
exclusively focusing on this crop

4124
02:20:55,280 --> 02:20:58,640
because

4125
02:20:55,760 --> 02:20:59,520
it's a new crop and so you know it's

4126
02:20:58,639 --> 02:21:02,639
like i'm

4127
02:20:59,520 --> 02:21:05,359
i am learning more and more about

4128
02:21:02,639 --> 02:21:06,159
you know different indoor outdoor

4129
02:21:05,359 --> 02:21:08,559
greenhouse

4130
02:21:06,159 --> 02:21:09,920
uh you know environment environments

4131
02:21:08,559 --> 02:21:12,239
pest compasses

4132
02:21:09,920 --> 02:21:13,840
different different states and their

4133
02:21:12,239 --> 02:21:15,520
pests but you're learning

4134
02:21:13,840 --> 02:21:17,600
the curve my learning curve is like that

4135
02:21:15,520 --> 02:21:17,920
yeah so that's so that's kind of my goal

4136
02:21:17,600 --> 02:21:20,640
is

4137
02:21:17,920 --> 02:21:22,559
focus on this niche um i know i couldn't

4138
02:21:20,639 --> 02:21:25,119
tell you anything about plant nutrition

4139
02:21:22,559 --> 02:21:27,359
you know other than what a basic

4140
02:21:25,120 --> 02:21:28,160
botany class or plant physiology class

4141
02:21:27,359 --> 02:21:30,159
taught me

4142
02:21:28,159 --> 02:21:32,079
you know but going forward that would

4143
02:21:30,159 --> 02:21:33,039
probably be really helpful to you

4144
02:21:32,079 --> 02:21:35,760
because oh sure

4145
02:21:33,040 --> 02:21:36,560
that not like yeah you know when you're

4146
02:21:35,760 --> 02:21:39,040
talking about

4147
02:21:36,559 --> 02:21:41,519
well don't get me wrong i mean i do know

4148
02:21:39,040 --> 02:21:42,080
i did take i mean aphid afib is known to

4149
02:21:41,520 --> 02:21:45,600
blow up

4150
02:21:42,079 --> 02:21:46,959
and uh plants are excessively you know

4151
02:21:45,600 --> 02:21:49,200
they have excessive nitrogen right

4152
02:21:46,959 --> 02:21:50,398
exactly right so so why wouldn't that

4153
02:21:49,200 --> 02:21:51,840
apply to this

4154
02:21:50,398 --> 02:21:53,519
i don't know if we're sure about that

4155
02:21:51,840 --> 02:21:55,439
yet but it's something i follow

4156
02:21:53,520 --> 02:21:56,720
you know and we we definitely you know

4157
02:21:55,439 --> 02:21:58,159
you can't get you can't get into

4158
02:21:56,719 --> 02:22:01,279
agricultural pest management without

4159
02:21:58,159 --> 02:22:04,239
knowing something about plant physiology

4160
02:22:01,280 --> 02:22:05,520
yeah because of those relationships or

4161
02:22:04,239 --> 02:22:07,280
but i would never jump into growing

4162
02:22:05,520 --> 02:22:09,280
let's put it that way i'm not

4163
02:22:07,280 --> 02:22:10,399
i i would land fl i could probably

4164
02:22:09,280 --> 02:22:12,479
protect the plant but

4165
02:22:10,398 --> 02:22:15,358
it would be a spindly you know weak

4166
02:22:12,478 --> 02:22:15,358
plant low yield

4167
02:22:15,760 --> 02:22:19,920
but it'd survive unlike times it might

4168
02:22:17,920 --> 02:22:23,200
be pest free oh yeah

4169
02:22:19,920 --> 02:22:25,359
yeah robusto that then

4170
02:22:23,200 --> 02:22:27,200
right i'm still letting them go it's so

4171
02:22:25,359 --> 02:22:28,239
funny because even some of these back

4172
02:22:27,200 --> 02:22:30,079
there are sort of like

4173
02:22:28,239 --> 02:22:31,680
they have a will to live well keep in

4174
02:22:30,079 --> 02:22:33,600
mind if there is a disease there

4175
02:22:31,680 --> 02:22:36,239
you're harboring that you know

4176
02:22:33,600 --> 02:22:38,159
potentially harboring botrytis so

4177
02:22:36,239 --> 02:22:39,760
all that dead tissue when when you get

4178
02:22:38,159 --> 02:22:40,879
it you want it you want to clean up yeah

4179
02:22:39,760 --> 02:22:41,680
you're going to want to clean that whole

4180
02:22:40,879 --> 02:22:44,159
area

4181
02:22:41,680 --> 02:22:45,760
you know yeah um burn it strawberry

4182
02:22:44,159 --> 02:22:48,840
growers like i was telling you

4183
02:22:45,760 --> 02:22:50,159
they pick up the the strawberries and

4184
02:22:48,840 --> 02:22:52,639
toms

4185
02:22:50,159 --> 02:22:53,439
yeah they clean up get rid of them get

4186
02:22:52,639 --> 02:22:57,039
them far away

4187
02:22:53,439 --> 02:23:00,079
yeah it's uh because you've you've uh

4188
02:22:57,040 --> 02:23:01,600
you basically have a propagule something

4189
02:23:00,079 --> 02:23:04,159
that can

4190
02:23:01,600 --> 02:23:05,680
come back to life once it has a

4191
02:23:04,159 --> 02:23:08,000
susceptible host

4192
02:23:05,680 --> 02:23:08,880
right right and a and the and the

4193
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:12,079
environment

4194
02:23:08,879 --> 02:23:14,159
and then the toastmasters like airborne

4195
02:23:12,079 --> 02:23:18,000
like spore life right

4196
02:23:14,159 --> 02:23:20,478
and if botrytis is a problem in tomatoes

4197
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:22,079
and you have those there or if it's you

4198
02:23:20,478 --> 02:23:23,199
know a problem in any one of these other

4199
02:23:22,079 --> 02:23:27,120
crops of yours which

4200
02:23:23,200 --> 02:23:29,600
this one looks like a poo with leaves uh

4201
02:23:27,120 --> 02:23:29,600
coming out

4202
02:23:30,559 --> 02:23:35,600
it looks like a poo with leaves coming

4203
02:23:33,200 --> 02:23:35,600
out of it

4204
02:23:35,680 --> 02:23:40,720
yeah you you um you know you

4205
02:23:38,879 --> 02:23:42,959
if you have spores that landed on your

4206
02:23:40,719 --> 02:23:44,318
lawn there and you watered with a

4207
02:23:42,959 --> 02:23:46,959
sprinkler

4208
02:23:44,318 --> 02:23:48,639
and this is one way that spores can move

4209
02:23:46,959 --> 02:23:51,199
from plant to plant

4210
02:23:48,639 --> 02:23:52,799
the drops of water hit the ground pick

4211
02:23:51,200 --> 02:23:56,240
up the spores and splash

4212
02:23:52,799 --> 02:23:56,719
onto the growing bed and then it happens

4213
02:23:56,239 --> 02:23:58,559
again

4214
02:23:56,719 --> 02:24:00,079
and or the wind dries that spore now

4215
02:23:58,559 --> 02:24:00,639
that it's gotten closer to the plant and

4216
02:24:00,079 --> 02:24:02,639
the

4217
02:24:00,639 --> 02:24:05,840
spore flies up and lands let's say on a

4218
02:24:02,639 --> 02:24:08,159
pistol as it's just beginning to show

4219
02:24:05,840 --> 02:24:08,960
signs of like the flower primordia right

4220
02:24:08,159 --> 02:24:11,600
that's all you need

4221
02:24:08,959 --> 02:24:12,639
that's spores there and that could be

4222
02:24:11,600 --> 02:24:14,640
exactly what happened

4223
02:24:12,639 --> 02:24:16,159
it could be the death of watched it

4224
02:24:14,639 --> 02:24:16,639
happen it was like i knew it was

4225
02:24:16,159 --> 02:24:19,200
happening

4226
02:24:16,639 --> 02:24:20,559
because it's like you know you can see

4227
02:24:19,200 --> 02:24:22,399
it happening it's obvious

4228
02:24:20,559 --> 02:24:23,600
but i didn't know i mean there's nothing

4229
02:24:22,398 --> 02:24:25,920
i could do to prevent it

4230
02:24:23,600 --> 02:24:28,000
i didn't know i mean you know i mean it

4231
02:24:25,920 --> 02:24:30,960
was so fast literally within a few

4232
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:32,719
days and also i'm like i i need like

4233
02:24:30,959 --> 02:24:34,239
rather than go in and do that i'm like

4234
02:24:32,719 --> 02:24:35,679
oh right this is the first one i know

4235
02:24:34,239 --> 02:24:37,359
what's happening but i need i want to

4236
02:24:35,680 --> 02:24:39,200
have someone come here

4237
02:24:37,359 --> 02:24:40,399
you know that's what we're going to do

4238
02:24:39,200 --> 02:24:42,880
yeah so that's why i

4239
02:24:40,398 --> 02:24:43,599
saw we're setting up next year i think

4240
02:24:42,879 --> 02:24:46,398
it's the plan

4241
02:24:43,600 --> 02:24:47,359
go in and rip everything you know like

4242
02:24:46,398 --> 02:24:49,760
all the brown

4243
02:24:47,359 --> 02:24:50,960
because i i bent that with a few of them

4244
02:24:49,760 --> 02:24:52,318
and there's nothing left

4245
02:24:50,959 --> 02:24:54,159
yeah there's a chance that if you had

4246
02:24:52,318 --> 02:24:56,639
harvested this last week

4247
02:24:54,159 --> 02:24:58,398
gotten rid of all the dead dry brown and

4248
02:24:56,639 --> 02:25:00,159
got it got in on maybe some kind of

4249
02:24:58,398 --> 02:25:00,719
really aggressive drying of everything

4250
02:25:00,159 --> 02:25:03,760
else

4251
02:25:00,719 --> 02:25:05,279
that you'd have saved half of it but

4252
02:25:03,760 --> 02:25:07,359
yeah i know i mean that's uh

4253
02:25:05,280 --> 02:25:08,640
i think once peter and i met that was

4254
02:25:07,359 --> 02:25:11,439
kind of the

4255
02:25:08,639 --> 02:25:12,799
the idea is if i become part of this

4256
02:25:11,439 --> 02:25:15,439
thing

4257
02:25:12,799 --> 02:25:17,119
you know i'll be around next year or

4258
02:25:15,439 --> 02:25:19,760
next time in l.a

4259
02:25:17,120 --> 02:25:20,560
yeah yeah yeah to to to see what we

4260
02:25:19,760 --> 02:25:23,760
could do to

4261
02:25:20,559 --> 02:25:24,639
you know do our best to protect you know

4262
02:25:23,760 --> 02:25:27,920
there's this other thing

4263
02:25:24,639 --> 02:25:30,079
we need eric nugshot to come uh

4264
02:25:27,920 --> 02:25:32,000
i'm so like such an advocate for

4265
02:25:30,079 --> 02:25:33,760
homegrown i've had this i'm gonna admire

4266
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:36,799
this with the camera and like

4267
02:25:33,760 --> 02:25:38,318
you know like tending to people you know

4268
02:25:36,799 --> 02:25:40,559
that's why there was another part of

4269
02:25:38,318 --> 02:25:42,639
this like let's see if we can

4270
02:25:40,559 --> 02:25:44,959
and we have an indoor thing here can we

4271
02:25:42,639 --> 02:25:47,358
uh successfully do some home grows

4272
02:25:44,959 --> 02:25:48,079
oh no doubt and then i thought well you

4273
02:25:47,359 --> 02:25:51,200
know take

4274
02:25:48,079 --> 02:25:52,000
ten of them for people you know um and i

4275
02:25:51,200 --> 02:25:55,120
think that actually

4276
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:56,639
with with with cannabis um you know

4277
02:25:55,120 --> 02:25:59,040
people should want their home growth but

4278
02:25:56,639 --> 02:26:00,719
it's a lot of work i'm realizing it's

4279
02:25:59,040 --> 02:26:03,359
really a lot of work because

4280
02:26:00,719 --> 02:26:05,279
you know you almost have to have daily

4281
02:26:03,359 --> 02:26:08,720
eyeballs on them

4282
02:26:05,280 --> 02:26:10,880
and um i was wasn't really aware of that

4283
02:26:08,719 --> 02:26:11,840
and even something as small as this it's

4284
02:26:10,879 --> 02:26:15,599
like

4285
02:26:11,840 --> 02:26:18,639
you know like catching like seeing

4286
02:26:15,600 --> 02:26:19,200
like catching like it's it's work it's

4287
02:26:18,639 --> 02:26:21,439
work

4288
02:26:19,200 --> 02:26:23,280
like you you know and and i even got one

4289
02:26:21,439 --> 02:26:26,479
of these

4290
02:26:23,280 --> 02:26:30,479
like this just so i can get in real

4291
02:26:26,478 --> 02:26:32,239
close nice um i still didn't touch all

4292
02:26:30,478 --> 02:26:34,719
of them but that's what it takes so

4293
02:26:32,239 --> 02:26:35,280
it does and there are all kinds of tools

4294
02:26:34,719 --> 02:26:37,760
for it

4295
02:26:35,280 --> 02:26:39,359
and um you know if you if you know me

4296
02:26:37,760 --> 02:26:42,960
long enough you'll know

4297
02:26:39,359 --> 02:26:45,600
i'm a pre i preach monitoring i preach

4298
02:26:42,959 --> 02:26:46,639
it's it's you preach mono what

4299
02:26:45,600 --> 02:26:50,720
monitoring

4300
02:26:46,639 --> 02:26:53,840
monitoring if you don't spend

4301
02:26:50,719 --> 02:26:55,519
the labor resources on monitoring um you

4302
02:26:53,840 --> 02:26:58,559
could end up with

4303
02:26:55,520 --> 02:27:02,239
you know a really bad situation quick

4304
02:26:58,559 --> 02:27:05,439
yeah and um really quick yeah

4305
02:27:02,239 --> 02:27:07,760
like within two weeks last year

4306
02:27:05,439 --> 02:27:09,520
even even more than that because when i

4307
02:27:07,760 --> 02:27:12,159
i let him know

4308
02:27:09,520 --> 02:27:13,600
right away what was going on and he has

4309
02:27:12,159 --> 02:27:15,439
the text

4310
02:27:13,600 --> 02:27:17,120
it was and i was like i think i've lost

4311
02:27:15,439 --> 02:27:18,800
the whole thing yeah i think

4312
02:27:17,120 --> 02:27:21,040
that was a week and a half ago easily i

4313
02:27:18,799 --> 02:27:21,840
go i i'm pretty sure this entire thing

4314
02:27:21,040 --> 02:27:24,240
is gone

4315
02:27:21,840 --> 02:27:25,280
because i saw what was happening and

4316
02:27:24,239 --> 02:27:27,439
that was a weekend

4317
02:27:25,280 --> 02:27:29,680
yeah i was in rhode island yeah yeah

4318
02:27:27,439 --> 02:27:30,880
that that that hot event could have also

4319
02:27:29,680 --> 02:27:31,760
been something to do with it right

4320
02:27:30,879 --> 02:27:34,639
although

4321
02:27:31,760 --> 02:27:36,318
yeah the heavy presence of so when he

4322
02:27:34,639 --> 02:27:39,760
texted me that

4323
02:27:36,318 --> 02:27:41,600
my response was keep an eye on the other

4324
02:27:39,760 --> 02:27:42,239
buds look into them with a knife and

4325
02:27:41,600 --> 02:27:44,239
eyes

4326
02:27:42,239 --> 02:27:45,600
to see if you can find any caterpillars

4327
02:27:44,239 --> 02:27:47,439
like pri prime of

4328
02:27:45,600 --> 02:27:48,640
like look closely to see if there are

4329
02:27:47,439 --> 02:27:50,559
any caterpillars in there

4330
02:27:48,639 --> 02:27:52,559
well now you know to look for the poop

4331
02:27:50,559 --> 02:27:54,799
and the feeding the leaf feeding damage

4332
02:27:52,559 --> 02:27:55,600
right but clearly once you you you know

4333
02:27:54,799 --> 02:27:57,840
what you need to

4334
02:27:55,600 --> 02:28:00,559
you need you know you need to you have

4335
02:27:57,840 --> 02:28:04,159
older bodies on that smell

4336
02:28:00,559 --> 02:28:06,799
and then have her bark

4337
02:28:04,159 --> 02:28:08,719
when she smells it that specific worm

4338
02:28:06,799 --> 02:28:10,318
poop i mean uh caterpillar poo maybe the

4339
02:28:08,719 --> 02:28:12,318
cats will be better

4340
02:28:10,318 --> 02:28:13,840
that's right that's an interesting idea

4341
02:28:12,318 --> 02:28:16,559
using dogs yeah

4342
02:28:13,840 --> 02:28:18,799
dogs for scouting yeah you're pests yeah

4343
02:28:16,559 --> 02:28:18,799
yeah

4344
02:28:19,040 --> 02:28:22,800
i mean yeah okay i gotta go home and

4345
02:28:21,920 --> 02:28:25,829
cook dinner

4346
02:28:22,799 --> 02:28:27,759
but uh this was awesome

4347
02:28:25,829 --> 02:28:31,920
[Music]

4348
02:28:27,760 --> 02:28:34,960
you are like uh jesus

4349
02:28:31,920 --> 02:28:36,960
sacrificing himself for the good of

4350
02:28:34,959 --> 02:28:39,839
other home growers everywhere i'm a

4351
02:28:36,959 --> 02:28:39,839
homegrown martyr

4352
02:28:41,760 --> 02:28:45,760
and next year we'll bring some new

4353
02:28:43,359 --> 02:28:47,399
diseases and plagues well i'll tell you

4354
02:28:45,760 --> 02:28:49,920
to attack your plants it's so

4355
02:28:47,398 --> 02:28:52,239
demoralizing because that feeling like

4356
02:28:49,920 --> 02:28:54,960
two weeks ago when i was like you know

4357
02:28:52,239 --> 02:28:54,959
because i've gone

4358
02:28:59,200 --> 02:29:03,200
and just not even because i don't like

4359
02:29:00,879 --> 02:29:06,799
touching them but and so

4360
02:29:03,200 --> 02:29:08,319
like so sticky and i'm like oh my god

4361
02:29:06,799 --> 02:29:10,159
i made this happen because i've been

4362
02:29:08,318 --> 02:29:10,959
taking so much good care of them and i'm

4363
02:29:10,159 --> 02:29:14,478
like

4364
02:29:10,959 --> 02:29:16,159
and so that feeling was beyond

4365
02:29:14,478 --> 02:29:17,679
if you're a cannabis lover and go and

4366
02:29:16,159 --> 02:29:19,039
because that's how they work like

4367
02:29:17,680 --> 02:29:20,720
i wouldn't even touch them and my

4368
02:29:19,040 --> 02:29:21,520
fingers would come away i'm not even

4369
02:29:20,719 --> 02:29:23,119
touching them

4370
02:29:21,520 --> 02:29:24,800
and contrast that with your current

4371
02:29:23,120 --> 02:29:26,880
feeling

4372
02:29:24,799 --> 02:29:28,719
so how how how long have you been

4373
02:29:26,879 --> 02:29:31,039
growing here's the thing

4374
02:29:28,719 --> 02:29:32,639
this is my first yeah so you just have

4375
02:29:31,040 --> 02:29:34,240
to talk to a few cannabis growers and

4376
02:29:32,639 --> 02:29:36,079
ask them the messes they've had to deal

4377
02:29:34,239 --> 02:29:37,280
with oh you know i already know i mean i

4378
02:29:36,079 --> 02:29:39,520
know i mean i know

4379
02:29:37,280 --> 02:29:41,439
there's a learning curve yeah no i

4380
02:29:39,520 --> 02:29:43,680
there's always a learning curve i know

4381
02:29:41,439 --> 02:29:44,398
this loss is relevant all i'm saying is

4382
02:29:43,680 --> 02:29:46,398
like

4383
02:29:44,398 --> 02:29:47,760
that coming from that feeling down to

4384
02:29:46,398 --> 02:29:49,519
the other one you really have to do a

4385
02:29:47,760 --> 02:29:52,239
little work to

4386
02:29:49,520 --> 02:29:53,600
to revisit that you know to jump back in

4387
02:29:52,239 --> 02:29:57,600
and go okay

4388
02:29:53,600 --> 02:29:58,720
but um but like all the growers i've

4389
02:29:57,600 --> 02:30:00,960
talked to you know who've done it

4390
02:29:58,719 --> 02:30:03,599
they're like you know you know

4391
02:30:00,959 --> 02:30:04,079
well your plant's done yes they don't

4392
02:30:03,600 --> 02:30:06,318
you know

4393
02:30:04,079 --> 02:30:08,719
yep you know uh and then you grow new

4394
02:30:06,318 --> 02:30:11,760
ones and it's the cycle of life and

4395
02:30:08,719 --> 02:30:13,840
you know yeah

4396
02:30:11,760 --> 02:30:15,359
so but here's the other thing he brought

4397
02:30:13,840 --> 02:30:17,120
these things over the experience

4398
02:30:15,359 --> 02:30:18,239
even even the one on the left just like

4399
02:30:17,120 --> 02:30:18,880
i didn't think it was going to make it

4400
02:30:18,239 --> 02:30:20,478
it was like

4401
02:30:18,879 --> 02:30:23,119
sickly it was nothing and it's like

4402
02:30:20,478 --> 02:30:24,959
every day so they're like little babies

4403
02:30:23,120 --> 02:30:26,479
and nursing them back and it became this

4404
02:30:24,959 --> 02:30:29,039
beautiful little plant only then

4405
02:30:26,478 --> 02:30:29,840
he's bonded with them i have bonded with

4406
02:30:29,040 --> 02:30:33,040
them

4407
02:30:29,840 --> 02:30:34,719
i have it's sad i know yeah i've um

4408
02:30:33,040 --> 02:30:36,720
but here's the other thing these were

4409
02:30:34,719 --> 02:30:39,840
also designed it's not a

4410
02:30:36,719 --> 02:30:43,039
it's not living soil it's like but

4411
02:30:39,840 --> 02:30:45,840
and we everything was according to

4412
02:30:43,040 --> 02:30:47,359
uh these guys you know organics alive

4413
02:30:45,840 --> 02:30:50,799

4415
02:30:50,799 --> 02:30:53,759
just uh yeah

4416
02:30:51,840 --> 02:30:55,040

4417
02:30:53,760 --> 02:30:56,639
ignored it's it's

4418
02:30:55,040 --> 02:30:58,399
life that came so it's sort of like

4419
02:30:56,639 --> 02:31:00,000
finding the balance you know

4420
02:30:58,398 --> 02:31:01,439
i don't want to fill the caterpillar if

4421

02:31:51,439 --> 02:31:54,318
was

4447
02:31:51,840 --> 02:31:57,680
the idea so when you come back next year

4448
02:31:54,318 --> 02:32:03,680
tom's gonna have a 4x60 bed

4449
02:31:57,680 --> 02:32:05,520
in those lines she was at his 22nd

4450
02:32:03,680 --> 02:32:06,960
i think cultivation in that's in that

4451
02:32:05,520 --> 02:32:08,960
same soil

4452
02:32:06,959 --> 02:32:11,519
and so he's supposed to get richer and

4453
02:32:08,959 --> 02:32:14,559
richer as it goes on 22 is a lot

4454
02:32:11,520 --> 02:32:19,120
yeah it's like years you know it's

4455
02:32:14,559 --> 02:32:22,318
it's really i think it's foreign

4456
02:32:19,120 --> 02:32:23,439
over five i think uh i think we did the

4457
02:32:22,318 --> 02:32:24,478
math might have been four and a half

4458
02:32:23,439 --> 02:32:28,000
it's on the table

4459
02:32:24,478 --> 02:32:31,199
yeah yeah it's it's all it's a science

4460
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:33,439
um and it's an art um you know people

4461
02:32:31,200 --> 02:32:36,800
have to have worked with a crop in a

4462
02:32:33,439 --> 02:32:38,960
specific growing system to really

4463
02:32:36,799 --> 02:32:40,159
figure out how to make it work some

4464
02:32:38,959 --> 02:32:43,599
people are gifted

4465
02:32:40,159 --> 02:32:44,559
um yeah it's uh and everything was

4466
02:32:43,600 --> 02:32:47,280
consistent which

4467
02:32:44,559 --> 02:32:48,639
is always impressive to go and see the

4468
02:32:47,280 --> 02:32:52,000
plants everything was a

4469
02:32:48,639 --> 02:32:54,959
beautiful grow not even terribly

4470
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:56,639
large and he has his hands on everything

4471
02:32:54,959 --> 02:32:57,039
this guy who was a mixed martial as guy

4472
02:32:56,639 --> 02:32:58,639
and now

4473
02:32:57,040 --> 02:33:00,560
and his knowledge is so he's totally

4474
02:32:58,639 --> 02:33:02,398
into it and so that was basically the

4475
02:33:00,559 --> 02:33:04,719
question because everything he

4476
02:33:02,398 --> 02:33:06,000
produces he sells right he's got a sweet

4477
02:33:04,719 --> 02:33:07,599
little small business

4478
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:09,120
but everyone wants to get bigger we're

4479
02:33:07,600 --> 02:33:11,120
not selling any of this no

4480
02:33:09,120 --> 02:33:12,640
no none of this but how do you get

4481
02:33:11,120 --> 02:33:15,680
bigger and maintain

4482
02:33:12,639 --> 02:33:16,799
quality control maybe go slow maybe go

4483
02:33:15,680 --> 02:33:19,600
slow

4484
02:33:16,799 --> 02:33:20,959
i've seen i've seen so i've seen so many

4485
02:33:19,600 --> 02:33:23,600
people fall

4486
02:33:20,959 --> 02:33:25,119
flat on their face just biting off more

4487
02:33:23,600 --> 02:33:27,680
than they could chew

4488
02:33:25,120 --> 02:33:29,200
um and if you're making it with a small

4489
02:33:27,680 --> 02:33:30,559
business if you're paying your people

4490
02:33:29,200 --> 02:33:33,280
you're making some money

4491
02:33:30,559 --> 02:33:34,239
what's wrong with that right that's why

4492
02:33:33,280 --> 02:33:37,280
people go to

4493
02:33:34,239 --> 02:33:37,520
um and and major in in and get degrees

4494
02:33:37,280 --> 02:33:40,239
in

4495
02:33:37,520 --> 02:33:42,560
agricultural business because you know

4496
02:33:40,239 --> 02:33:44,879
that teaches you how to do that

4497
02:33:42,559 --> 02:33:46,000
how to start a farm yeah and make it

4498
02:33:44,879 --> 02:33:48,799
successful and

4499
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:49,520
and grow and and eventually become rich

4500
02:33:48,799 --> 02:33:51,759
from it yeah

4501
02:33:49,520 --> 02:33:53,120
you know but you you jump into it

4502
02:33:51,760 --> 02:33:56,318
without really knowing

4503
02:33:53,120 --> 02:33:59,280
what's involved you you've kind of

4504
02:33:56,318 --> 02:34:01,439
you've set yourself up you know um well

4505

i mean would be interesting i i think

4506
02:34:01,439 --> 02:34:05,760

this

4565
02:36:21,439 --> 02:36:24,960
like the gardener it's a totally

4566
02:36:23,600 --> 02:36:28,479
different

4567
02:36:24,959 --> 02:36:30,719
this plant over here brought it to me

4568
02:36:28,478 --> 02:36:32,079
the gardener brought that like from his

4569
02:36:30,719 --> 02:36:35,279
house

4570
02:36:32,079 --> 02:36:36,959
tom that's like a vector of in fact he's

4571
02:36:35,280 --> 02:36:39,200
it probably has like

4572
02:36:36,959 --> 02:36:40,398
mites and yeah that's a that's like a

4573
02:36:39,200 --> 02:36:41,920
spider mite and

4574
02:36:40,398 --> 02:36:44,559
actually i would love for you to look at

4575
02:36:41,920 --> 02:36:48,239
that right now and be like dude this has

4576
02:36:44,559 --> 02:36:48,239
all sorts of stuff you don't want to be

4577
02:36:48,840 --> 02:36:51,840
introducing

4578
02:36:54,559 --> 02:37:01,760
wait so the gardener was like

4579
02:36:57,600 --> 02:37:04,880
what is it looks like

4580
02:37:01,760 --> 02:37:05,920
that looks like dirt actually yeah you

4581
02:37:04,879 --> 02:37:07,759
know i mean it's

4582
02:37:05,920 --> 02:37:09,359
totally different so he was like

4583
02:37:07,760 --> 02:37:10,960
flowering all right he was like you're

4584
02:37:09,359 --> 02:37:13,680
growing weed i'm growing some wheat

4585
02:37:10,959 --> 02:37:15,358
he goes here really well and he had it

4586
02:37:13,680 --> 02:37:17,359
in terrible soil

4587
02:37:15,359 --> 02:37:18,479
and i so i put it into this and put some

4588
02:37:17,359 --> 02:37:20,479
better dirt in there

4589
02:37:18,478 --> 02:37:22,318
tom you are such a caregiver to these

4590
02:37:20,478 --> 02:37:23,599
plants well i wanted to try to help him

4591
02:37:22,318 --> 02:37:25,600
but i think i'm gonna give it back to

4592
02:37:23,600 --> 02:37:27,359
him it's doing okay but i couldn't mess

4593
02:37:25,600 --> 02:37:28,960
with the roots so i couldn't mess with

4594
02:37:27,359 --> 02:37:31,040
his original

4595
02:37:28,959 --> 02:37:33,199

02:37:55,520 --> 02:37:58,079
it looked like it was burning a little

4611
02:37:56,478 --> 02:38:00,318
bit so i took it out of the sun but it's

4612
02:37:58,079 --> 02:38:01,840
been getting plenty of brought in there

4613
02:38:00,318 --> 02:38:04,559
what's that there's definitely rot in

4614
02:38:01,840 --> 02:38:08,239
there nice not nice

4615
02:38:04,559 --> 02:38:12,239
we're not the only ones it just got here

4616
02:38:08,239 --> 02:38:15,520
just got here tom you are like the grim

4617
02:38:12,239 --> 02:38:17,680
reaper for well yeah yeah weed plants

4618
02:38:15,520 --> 02:38:19,200
but this was it was it wasn't doing this

4619
02:38:17,680 --> 02:38:22,000
they're like i don't want to go to tom's

4620
02:38:19,200 --> 02:38:22,000
house yeah

4621
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:31,200
why not harvest it yes baby girl

4622
02:38:28,079 --> 02:38:31,840
crackers and cereal you can see them oh

4623
02:38:31,200 --> 02:38:35,120
my god

4624
02:38:31,840 --> 02:38:36,880
you're you're taking food to go yeah

4625
02:38:35,120 --> 02:38:42,160
my god she gave it to you you just took

4626
02:38:36,879 --> 02:38:45,039
it quickly yeah

4627
02:38:42,159 --> 02:38:46,159
yeah get it uh ground up i mean these do

4628
02:38:45,040 --> 02:38:47,920
look like

4629
02:38:46,159 --> 02:38:50,959
a little bit like turds but no i think

4630
02:38:47,920 --> 02:38:50,960
this is just dirt

4631
02:38:52,239 --> 02:38:56,559
yeah now we're finding them left and

4632
02:38:53,439 --> 02:38:58,960
right so show me how many uh

4633
02:38:56,559 --> 02:39:00,239
it's probably one minute about a minute

4634
02:38:58,959 --> 02:39:02,159
of scouting

4635
02:39:00,239 --> 02:39:04,079
how many are in there i don't know i

4636
02:39:02,159 --> 02:39:06,079
lost count probably ten yeah

4637
02:39:04,079 --> 02:39:08,079
and it just took about a minute so i

4638
02:39:06,079 --> 02:39:09,439
mean we've yet to see one bud here that

4639
02:39:08,079 --> 02:39:12,478
doesn't have

4640
02:39:09,439 --> 02:39:12,720
the poop in it so all right so basically

4641
02:39:12,478 --> 02:39:15,438
in

4642
02:39:12,719 --> 02:39:16,799
better non-blinding light we're finding

4643
02:39:15,439 --> 02:39:19,280
tons of caterpillars

4644
02:39:16,799 --> 02:39:19,840
they they're probably going to hide when

4645
02:39:19,280 --> 02:39:23,280
it's hot

4646
02:39:19,840 --> 02:39:24,960
right right so

4647
02:39:23,280 --> 02:39:26,800
uh now that it's cooling off they're

4648
02:39:24,959 --> 02:39:28,079
coming out to feed they might they might

4649
02:39:26,799 --> 02:39:31,279
be more likely to

4650
02:39:28,079 --> 02:39:34,799
come out and start chewing on social

4651
02:39:31,280 --> 02:39:34,800
green parts meat

4652
02:39:35,439 --> 02:39:42,318
yeah i mean if there is botrytis here

4653
02:39:39,600 --> 02:39:43,680
that's i'm more and more convinced

4654
02:39:42,318 --> 02:39:45,199
convinced

4655
02:39:43,680 --> 02:39:47,280
it's not the real problem the problem

4656
02:39:45,200 --> 02:39:51,200
with all this so we have

4657
02:39:47,280 --> 02:39:54,319
predominantly a caterpillar infestation

4658
02:39:51,200 --> 02:39:54,319
yeah now that you look well

4659
02:39:54,719 --> 02:39:58,159
you know then you can you'll find them

4660
02:39:56,879 --> 02:40:01,199
and

4661
02:39:58,159 --> 02:40:03,439
i mean that's that's a lot for

4662
02:40:01,200 --> 02:40:05,439
like a minute of scouting right yeah

4663
02:40:03,439 --> 02:40:08,479
this is uh

4664
02:40:05,439 --> 02:40:10,880
but the turds give it away interesting

4665
02:40:08,478 --> 02:40:12,559
that the leaves weren't focused on they

4666
02:40:10,879 --> 02:40:15,679
just came at the right time the moth

4667
02:40:12,559 --> 02:40:17,600
laid that's eggs at the right time

4668
02:40:15,680 --> 02:40:19,040
uh so sometimes they lay their eggs much

4669
02:40:17,600 --> 02:40:20,720
earlier and then you start i mean

4670
02:40:19,040 --> 02:40:22,640
you see like a lot more of this yeah i

4671
02:40:20,719 --> 02:40:24,318
mean you see normally what i see is a

4672
02:40:22,639 --> 02:40:25,519
lot of leaf chewing damage which leads

4673
02:40:24,318 --> 02:40:27,600
you to the area where you

4674
02:40:25,520 --> 02:40:28,800
like this here which which leads you to

4675
02:40:27,600 --> 02:40:32,079
where to look for them

4676
02:40:28,799 --> 02:40:34,398
you know so um okay i see that leaf

4677
02:40:32,079 --> 02:40:36,239
chewed i see that leaf chewed there

4678
02:40:34,398 --> 02:40:38,719
there's got to be a caterpillar here i

4679
02:40:36,239 --> 02:40:40,799
look but normally

4680
02:40:38,719 --> 02:40:43,119
where you don't see leaf chewing you

4681
02:40:40,799 --> 02:40:44,959
don't expect them to be there so

4682
02:40:43,120 --> 02:40:46,560
i'm wondering if what happened they they

4683
02:40:44,959 --> 02:40:49,438
hatched by the time there was

4684
02:40:46,559 --> 02:40:50,559
significant amount of flower tissue and

4685
02:40:49,439 --> 02:40:54,479
started feeding

4686
02:40:50,559 --> 02:40:57,680
unbeknownst to tom and

4687
02:40:54,478 --> 02:40:58,639
by the time you got to this stage they

4688
02:40:57,680 --> 02:41:02,079
were everywhere

4689
02:40:58,639 --> 02:41:03,760
they were just hiding here's one see

4690
02:41:02,079 --> 02:41:06,559
it's uh

4691
02:41:03,760 --> 02:41:08,398
well i mean i have had people out here

4692
02:41:06,559 --> 02:41:10,719
who were more knowledgeable than me

4693
02:41:08,398 --> 02:41:11,840
but they didn't well i think when we saw

4694
02:41:10,719 --> 02:41:15,039
that first one

4695
02:41:11,840 --> 02:41:18,239
was kind of like the early days of them

4696
02:41:15,040 --> 02:41:19,120
exactly when i would have started i mean

4697
02:41:18,239 --> 02:41:20,799
if i'd known

4698
02:41:19,120 --> 02:41:22,479
but you know what there peter does make

4699
02:41:20,799 --> 02:41:24,799
a very important point is

4700
02:41:22,478 --> 02:41:25,599
when you scout is important i tend to

4701
02:41:24,799 --> 02:41:28,239
like

4702
02:41:25,600 --> 02:41:29,600
cooler part of the morning for scouting

4703
02:41:28,239 --> 02:41:31,359
for exactly this reason

4704
02:41:29,600 --> 02:41:33,439
when we first came out here was nothing

4705
02:41:31,359 --> 02:41:36,559
like this and now we're seeing them

4706
02:41:33,439 --> 02:41:39,279
i mean i'm picking them out of practice

4707
02:41:36,559 --> 02:41:39,278
one-handed

4708
02:41:40,079 --> 02:41:44,318
yeah so they got you good but you'll be

4709
02:41:43,279 --> 02:41:48,560
ready next year

4710
02:41:44,318 --> 02:41:51,519
that's right shake it off tom

4711
02:41:48,559 --> 02:41:54,639
okay i'm gonna bring gemma home actually

4712
02:41:51,520 --> 02:41:56,640
i've already shaken it off this has been

4713
02:41:54,639 --> 02:41:59,519
uh i mean the thing is is like you just

4714
02:41:56,639 --> 02:42:02,799
need to know i could ba i

4715
02:41:59,520 --> 02:42:04,880
i could that that is you you can i could

4716
02:42:02,799 --> 02:42:06,799
deal with that i can

4717
02:42:04,879 --> 02:42:09,039
i'm already dealing with with

4718
02:42:06,799 --> 02:42:13,199
caterpillars next time yeah look at this

4719
02:42:09,040 --> 02:42:15,600
look at why not just like the

4720
02:42:13,200 --> 02:42:15,600
turds

4721
02:42:16,719 --> 02:42:22,559
yeah knowledge is power right absolutely

4722
02:42:20,879 --> 02:42:25,199
i'm not scared of that so we know the

4723
02:42:22,559 --> 02:42:27,119
strategy scares me is not no

4724
02:42:25,200 --> 02:42:30,399
good thing is so far it's just been that

4725
02:42:27,120 --> 02:42:33,680
corny like miniature rabbit

4726
02:42:30,398 --> 02:42:35,680
pellets all right cool

4727
02:42:33,680 --> 02:42:39,920
i'll leave you guys to you guys are like

4728
02:42:35,680 --> 02:42:39,920
uh gorillas grooming the uh

4729
02:42:48,318 --> 02:42:52,398
a lot of unhappy caterpillars and

4730
02:42:50,559 --> 02:42:54,959
alcohol

4731
02:42:52,398 --> 02:42:56,239
so you basically id these and be like

4732
02:42:54,959 --> 02:42:57,599
they're all the same thing

4733
02:42:56,239 --> 02:43:01,520
it looks like it's all the same

4734
02:42:57,600 --> 02:43:04,720
caterpillar all right that's crazy

4735
02:43:01,520 --> 02:43:06,960
okey-dokey all right it's hard to walk

4736
02:43:04,719 --> 02:43:06,959
away

4737
02:43:07,120 --> 02:43:11,359
it's like it's like when did we find the

4738
02:43:09,680 --> 02:43:15,200
last easter egg we don't

4739
02:43:11,359 --> 02:43:16,000
really funny so young a very young larva

4740
02:43:15,200 --> 02:43:18,399
there

4741
02:43:16,000 --> 02:43:19,200
brownish yellowish brown all the way to

4742
02:43:18,398 --> 02:43:23,599
this

4743
02:43:19,200 --> 02:43:25,120
big fat green one but it's all the same

4744
02:43:23,600 --> 02:43:27,040
appears to be all the same did you get

4745
02:43:25,120 --> 02:43:29,600
that piece in one thing that was

4746
02:43:27,040 --> 02:43:30,960
just we have some more caterpillar okay

4747
02:43:29,600 --> 02:43:32,159
you have to dig in there and you'll find

4748
02:43:30,959 --> 02:43:34,318
them

4749
02:43:32,159 --> 02:43:38,239
more than likely if if you find this

4750
02:43:34,318 --> 02:43:39,680
many oh here's one i forgot that one

4751
02:43:38,239 --> 02:43:42,478
that one's a baby and they're all the

4752
02:43:39,680 --> 02:43:42,479
same species

4753
02:43:44,398 --> 02:43:49,920
okay so that is the uh corn ear

4754
02:43:48,318 --> 02:43:51,920
that's what it looks like to me i'm like

4755
02:43:49,920 --> 02:43:54,639
i said no what is the corner

4756
02:43:51,920 --> 02:43:55,359
it's the striping that that um i showed

4757
02:43:54,639 --> 02:43:57,358
you the photo

4758
02:43:55,359 --> 02:43:59,359
okay i'll show you the two stripes that

4759
02:43:57,359 --> 02:44:05,840
go down it's it's back

4760
02:43:59,359 --> 02:44:05,840
it's uh

4761
02:44:08,398 --> 02:44:10,478
you
