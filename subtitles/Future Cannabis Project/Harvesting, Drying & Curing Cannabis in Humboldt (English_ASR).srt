1
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:17,649
[Music]

2
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:19,929
so get into you know traditional methods

3
00:00:17,649 --> 00:00:22,359
especially for us that are more fans of

4
00:00:19,929 --> 00:00:24,189
outdoor growth in California nothing

5
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:26,169
against the perpetual crops coming out

6
00:00:24,189 --> 00:00:28,000
of indoor grows in Canada and Colorado

7
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:29,890
and everywhere else but this is crop

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,719
tober as we grow up knowing it right

9
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:34,808
this is when everything starts popping

10
00:00:31,719 --> 00:00:36,488
off so so where are you at and where are

11
00:00:34,808 --> 00:00:38,409
the folks you work with as far as your

12
00:00:36,488 --> 00:00:41,459
your dry and cure from bringing down the

13
00:00:38,409 --> 00:00:43,328
crops biggest challenge of the year yeah

14
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:45,579
especially when you're having a really

15
00:00:43,329 --> 00:00:48,160
good year and actually having really

16
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:49,929
good weather so the rains haven't really

17
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:51,759
hit we've had like one maybe two rains

18
00:00:49,929 --> 00:00:55,000
we roam we're gonna probably good

19
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:57,579
weather to October which means more

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,128
plant more yield and that's one of the

21
00:00:57,579 --> 00:01:02,739
hardest issues when especially when

22
00:01:00,128 --> 00:01:06,039
people are plotting new growth and I'm

23
00:01:02,738 --> 00:01:07,329
gonna grow 24,000 square foot and you

24
00:01:06,039 --> 00:01:08,890
got to really make sure you know where

25
00:01:07,329 --> 00:01:12,219
you're gonna hang and dry and cure all

26
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:15,819
that proper properly or you're gonna be

27
00:01:12,219 --> 00:01:17,438
devastated and I've been doing this a

28
00:01:15,819 --> 00:01:19,809
long time and I'm almost done same high

29
00:01:17,438 --> 00:01:22,599
devastation mode because we've expanded

30
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:24,850
in the way Humboldt County has done it

31
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:27,609
is we can't get any building permits

32
00:01:24,849 --> 00:01:30,399
until my final cannabis permit is issued

33
00:01:27,609 --> 00:01:33,219
I just got one last month so it's almost

34
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,719
to building up right now and I have one

35
00:01:33,219 --> 00:01:37,269
that's gonna get approved November 1st

36
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:39,908
so I'm having to make do with the space

37
00:01:37,269 --> 00:01:42,489
I have when you're trying to put 1,500

38
00:01:39,909 --> 00:01:45,189
pounds of weed into a 1600 square foot

39
00:01:42,489 --> 00:01:48,429
building it is an extreme challenge

40
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:50,349
yeah that's balancing the quality you

41
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:54,100
don't want to rush care anything

42
00:01:50,349 --> 00:01:58,119
you're having you meet you know more

43
00:01:54,099 --> 00:01:59,649
humid and humid days foggy mornings what

44
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:01,000
I'm trying to get at Marina Leo there's

45
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:03,820
more humidity in there

46
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,920
you know we're middle of the year we

47
00:02:03,819 --> 00:02:08,409
could even dry outside yeah light dips

48
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,599
so you can hang those in a shaded forest

49
00:02:08,409 --> 00:02:12,069
and it's gonna be great quality when you

50
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:13,780
come into October you got too much

51
00:02:12,069 --> 00:02:15,400
humidity too much moisture the

52
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:17,650
temperatures are drop your hitting mid

53
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,510
forties at night you got to have a

54
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:22,150
controlled environment you're talking

55
00:02:19,509 --> 00:02:24,219
about the marine layer and it's it's the

56
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:25,569
outdoor growers biggest friend yet the

57
00:02:24,219 --> 00:02:27,370
biggest enemy right I mean that's one

58
00:02:25,569 --> 00:02:29,349
thing that people don't understand is I

59
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:31,360
talk to I travel internationally for

60
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:33,069
work and most are familiar to the mo

61
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,900
triangle Mendocino is built a great

62
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:37,000
brand Humboldt is now building a great

63
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:39,400
brand as well a Trinity will probably

64
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,050
come around but people don't understand

65
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:43,330
it's not just the location the locale

66
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:45,580
and the altitude but it is that marine

67
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:48,219
layer that just is a perfect makes this

68
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:49,959
perfect eco right really factors into I

69
00:02:48,219 --> 00:02:52,180
know the phenotype beyond the genotype

70
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:53,890
of the plant but to your point yeah it's

71
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:55,870
tough and that's I was sharing earlier

72
00:02:53,889 --> 00:02:58,059
we were talking to a guy who he's just

73
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:59,709
got through 25 acres but he's he's

74
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:02,830
growing 11 acres right now and he's like

75
00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:04,780
I don't have a place to put 11 acres for

76
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:06,580
drying he's like I don't I'm trying to

77
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:08,739
find land sea containers but even then

78
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:11,230
only one side has doors so I'm not

79
00:03:08,739 --> 00:03:12,730
getting the proper ventilation so people

80
00:03:11,229 --> 00:03:14,229
don't recognize that you guys have this

81
00:03:12,729 --> 00:03:16,659
epidemic the more successful you are the

82
00:03:14,229 --> 00:03:17,768
more yield the more places you need to

83
00:03:16,659 --> 00:03:19,689
have and you're hanging on anything and

84
00:03:17,769 --> 00:03:21,459
sit still right very much and that's I

85
00:03:19,689 --> 00:03:23,859
try to avoid the cargo containers

86
00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:25,150
because unless you customize them they

87
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:27,930
just sweat you're gonna you're gonna

88
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:30,700
have problems but getting refrigerated

89
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:32,739
containers and fresh frozen and just

90
00:03:30,699 --> 00:03:34,449
lining up him so we're trying to get in

91
00:03:32,739 --> 00:03:36,159
that mode I have you know containers

92
00:03:34,449 --> 00:03:38,259
showing up this week and next week and

93
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:40,750
getting is a refrigeration a product

94
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:43,870
fresh frozen finding outlets for that

95
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:45,539
material and basically she's trying to

96
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:48,688
cycle through you know

97
00:03:45,539 --> 00:03:50,959
that's a big part of early when you have

98
00:03:48,688 --> 00:03:53,729
limitations on harvesting and curing

99
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:55,140
strain allotment is a huge thing so if I

100
00:03:53,729 --> 00:03:57,030
know I have a seven-week strain an

101
00:03:55,139 --> 00:03:58,979
8-week strain and nine weeks dream I

102
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:01,469
know I can have some balance I can cycle

103
00:03:58,979 --> 00:04:02,938
through the earlier stuff if you grow

104
00:04:01,469 --> 00:04:05,188
all the same thing that's gonna be

105
00:04:02,938 --> 00:04:08,250
harvested at the same time you're gonna

106
00:04:05,188 --> 00:04:10,769
screw yourself so working with all the

107
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:13,438
parameters I guess you just get used to

108
00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:15,150
it over the time and so focus on and

109
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:17,969
alright I got a seven week an eight week

110
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:21,389
a nine week a ten week and I'll be able

111
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:23,060
to bundle in and transition out the

112
00:04:21,389 --> 00:04:26,668
trimmers busy and keep the whole

113
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:28,019
processing keep it moving yeah and you

114
00:04:26,668 --> 00:04:30,659
can't rush some of that stuff right

115
00:04:28,019 --> 00:04:32,639
because you can't rush the the flush on

116
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:34,979
the plant you need to pace it you can't

117
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,120
rush the dry and obviously you want to

118
00:04:34,978 --> 00:04:38,310
spend time you have a little more room

119
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,598
to work with on the Cure yeah but your

120
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:41,699
point you're getting into this space and

121
00:04:39,598 --> 00:04:43,589
in the human capital do we have enough

122
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:45,410
people that are ready to trim as soon as

123
00:04:43,589 --> 00:04:47,969
I'm done my cure you know a lot of

124
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:50,880
logistical issues that can come about

125
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:53,430
right yeah so and I think in in general

126
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:56,129
for a longer cure on a on the larger

127
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:58,410
scale production is keeping the plan and

128
00:04:56,129 --> 00:05:00,240
intact as much as possible yeah even

129
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:02,310
when it's dried there's something about

130
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,978
being on the stock in the stand percent

131
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:07,589
that just really preserves the quality

132
00:05:04,978 --> 00:05:09,478
of the product as soon as you'd destem

133
00:05:07,589 --> 00:05:12,119
it that's when you start to lose your

134
00:05:09,478 --> 00:05:14,879
aggravation and degradation so I saw

135
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:17,009
that you know we were over want to say

136
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:19,168
which LP but at an LP in Israel and Tel

137
00:05:17,009 --> 00:05:20,098
Aviv and was looking at how they were

138
00:05:19,168 --> 00:05:22,680
modeling

139
00:05:20,098 --> 00:05:23,908
they're trying cure and they they

140
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,889
weren't bucking they were literally

141
00:05:23,908 --> 00:05:27,329
pulling every single butt off and

142
00:05:25,889 --> 00:05:28,889
putting them on these racks almost like

143
00:05:27,329 --> 00:05:31,259
cookies yeah I mean if you could replace

144
00:05:28,889 --> 00:05:32,340
those buds with little little bite size

145
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:34,918
of cookie so that's what they're doing

146
00:05:32,339 --> 00:05:37,769
I'm like have you guys read any books

147
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:39,120
yeah on how to do this because I know it

148
00:05:37,769 --> 00:05:41,158
sounds old-school and retro about

149
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,800
snapping stems to let people know when

150
00:05:41,158 --> 00:05:44,788
it's ready to go to cure from try but

151
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,978
these people have been doing it for

152
00:05:44,788 --> 00:05:48,629
decades and they've mastered this craft

153
00:05:46,978 --> 00:05:50,158
you might want to kind of take a page

154
00:05:48,629 --> 00:05:51,749
from what's happening in north

155
00:05:50,158 --> 00:05:54,629
pornea what you're describing yeah

156
00:05:51,749 --> 00:05:56,119
because again it might seem efficient to

157
00:05:54,629 --> 00:05:59,309
get it down to but as quick as possible

158
00:05:56,119 --> 00:06:01,409
it was not ready just for yeah yeah same

159
00:05:59,309 --> 00:06:03,088
with wet trimming here your products is

160
00:06:01,408 --> 00:06:05,188
gonna do degrade that much faster

161
00:06:03,088 --> 00:06:07,399
yep I mean no matter you know even if

162
00:06:05,189 --> 00:06:10,099
you use the Beauvais Aveda pack I mean

163
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:12,899
if you get it off that stalk and stem

164
00:06:10,098 --> 00:06:16,079
sooner than it needs to be then you're

165
00:06:12,899 --> 00:06:17,639
you're shortening the lifespan of that

166
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:19,468
exactly and that's what we try itself

167
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:21,059

168
00:06:19,468 --> 00:06:23,248
we were just we talked about some of

169
00:06:21,059 --> 00:06:24,959
these big shows MJ biz that's where I

170
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:26,639
kinda came up with the term from cure to

171
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:27,929
consumption so trying to explain to

172
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,749
people we can come in and help you

173
00:06:27,928 --> 00:06:33,058
fine-tune the cure in store for long

174
00:06:30,749 --> 00:06:34,979
term all the way up to retail maintain

175
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:37,139
the quality maintain the weight which is

176
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:38,278
important we're singing our overfilling

177
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:40,709
especially now that you have the

178
00:06:38,278 --> 00:06:42,868
variance issues yeah it's a whole other

179
00:06:40,709 --> 00:06:46,288
whole other topic for me to lose weight

180
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:48,119
just in yeah moving around from NorCal

181
00:06:46,288 --> 00:06:50,009
to SoCal you could lose grams a week

182
00:06:48,119 --> 00:06:51,509
exactly and I try to explain people to

183
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:53,879
they're like well what you know for us

184
00:06:51,509 --> 00:06:54,838
we have 58 62 they're like what's I'm

185
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:56,158
like well it's a bit of personal

186
00:06:54,838 --> 00:06:59,519
preference if you're a traditionalist

187
00:06:56,158 --> 00:07:01,678
like me we roll up 58 percent perfect on

188
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:03,929
the grind 62 is better for your Jeep in

189
00:07:01,678 --> 00:07:06,299
your dryer vape but I said also if

190
00:07:03,928 --> 00:07:08,248
you're south of Santa Barbara I the

191
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,899
desert rather be loads as la is a desert

192
00:07:08,249 --> 00:07:12,059
like people don't understand you just

193
00:07:09,899 --> 00:07:13,490
pointed out it's so arid it's so dry

194
00:07:12,059 --> 00:07:15,569
even though we're next to the ocean

195
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:17,009
compared to Northern California

196
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:18,899
I mean Northern California have this

197
00:07:17,009 --> 00:07:21,449
great humidity you have this perfect

198
00:07:18,899 --> 00:07:23,009
balance of sunlight and it changes from

199
00:07:21,449 --> 00:07:24,569
out there to down here oh no it's still

200
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:25,979
California the same thing like that's

201
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:27,389
just the name of the state it could be

202
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:29,278
two different states oh yeah

203
00:07:27,389 --> 00:07:33,389
based on the conditions so and even if

204
00:07:29,278 --> 00:07:36,120
it field it still yeah not foolproof

205
00:07:33,389 --> 00:07:38,658
yeah some control factor in there it's

206
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,658
definitely helpful

207
00:07:39,589 --> 00:07:48,729
