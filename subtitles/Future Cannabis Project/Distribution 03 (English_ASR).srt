1
00:00:16,939 --> 00:00:22,250
I said because I need to make sure I can

2
00:00:20,028 --> 00:00:25,039
I can get rid of product for my

3
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:26,989
cultivators and pay my cultivators

4
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,189
before I ask him for another set of it

5
00:00:26,989 --> 00:00:30,199
there and they say well those are great

6
00:00:28,189 --> 00:00:31,730
those are great strains they're gonna go

7
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:34,129
to another distributor I said it's more

8
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:35,628
important for me to write up to hand a

9
00:00:34,128 --> 00:00:38,750
chunk of money or write a check to the

10
00:00:35,628 --> 00:00:41,238
cultivator and and and miss the market

11
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:44,030
and not have enough product going into

12
00:00:41,238 --> 00:00:45,588
phase 2 and phase 3 then for me not to

13
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:48,018
be able to look somebody in the eyes

14
00:00:45,588 --> 00:00:51,198
that I love dearly and say I can't pay

15
00:00:48,018 --> 00:00:52,698
him I'm sorry you know there's too much

16
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:55,579
of that going on but that was the right

17
00:00:52,698 --> 00:00:57,768
decision at the table because none of us

18
00:00:55,579 --> 00:01:00,289
and I could probably speak for all of us

19
00:00:57,768 --> 00:01:02,058
didn't realize how large did how hard

20
00:01:00,289 --> 00:01:04,400
the distribution model was gonna be I

21
00:01:02,058 --> 00:01:05,750
don't know anybody actually if there's

22
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,090
anybody that tells you they know this

23
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:09,650
game she said in the beginning man turn

24
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:11,930
around and walk away cuz that guy knows

25
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:16,189
the littlest okay hands down they don't

26
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:18,049
know nothing so very difficult being a

27
00:01:16,188 --> 00:01:21,709
dis in the distributor because you're

28
00:01:18,049 --> 00:01:23,810
the middleman so and the other thing I'm

29
00:01:21,709 --> 00:01:26,030
a broker like I've been broker in my

30
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:28,368
whole life right this is no new game

31
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:31,218
this is the exact same situation I'm

32
00:01:28,368 --> 00:01:32,868
just I'm in bed I'm in business with the

33
00:01:31,218 --> 00:01:34,759
government now the state of California

34
00:01:32,868 --> 00:01:36,560
cities and everybody else but it's the

35
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:38,118
same game you know you have integrity

36
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,579
back then you always had the product I

37
00:01:38,118 --> 00:01:42,138
always pay everybody pays up front we

38
00:01:40,578 --> 00:01:44,029
pay everything gets paid in my channel

39
00:01:42,138 --> 00:01:45,530
that's why I'm here today right it was a

40
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:49,069
bunch of money but fronting a bunch of

41
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:51,920
stuff on stuff I never seen so at the

42
00:01:49,069 --> 00:01:55,340
end of the day I forget what the

43
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:57,049
questions were but uh you know I didn't

44
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:59,929
honestly she did say I think at the last

45
00:01:57,049 --> 00:02:01,670
one which is important was what are we

46
00:01:59,929 --> 00:02:03,439
doing now for the cultivator but what

47
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:05,868
are we plan on doing for the cultivator

48
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:07,788
next and I'm really excited to tell you

49
00:02:05,868 --> 00:02:10,849
that we're doing remediation we're doing

50
00:02:07,789 --> 00:02:12,709
flower remediation we're handling that

51
00:02:10,849 --> 00:02:15,919
like this is going to be kicking in gear

52
00:02:12,709 --> 00:02:18,580
pretty pretty soon here we're gonna take

53
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:21,079
care of a lot of flower remediation and

54
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:22,730
you know it's going to be another

55
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,440
service it's gonna go to me and go back

56
00:02:22,729 --> 00:02:26,719
to your distributor I'm willing to work

57
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:28,009
with everybody it's not like I'm a

58
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:29,599
distributor that wants to hold

59
00:02:28,009 --> 00:02:30,739
everything if you're a cultivator and

60
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:33,919
you did an hour

61
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:35,540
detest and you found some some powdery

62
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:37,429
mildews or some molds are some Petridis

63
00:02:35,539 --> 00:02:39,469
or something on your flower on your Rd

64
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:40,849
test what do you do with it I'll tell

65
00:02:39,469 --> 00:02:42,439
you all right all those other big

66
00:02:40,849 --> 00:02:44,359
distributors out there gonna say yeah

67
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:46,759
it's worth 100 bucks a pound

68
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:48,140
we're gonna run it all into a BH no

69
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:49,519
extract that's where they're gonna tell

70
00:02:48,139 --> 00:02:51,739
you they're gonna make huge margins

71
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:54,250
right but we're gonna help you

72
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:57,350
remediated and find a solution that is

73
00:02:54,250 --> 00:03:00,590
still putting money back in your product

74
00:02:57,349 --> 00:03:02,269
your pocket by doing a service taking it

75
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:04,099
back to you transporting it to another

76
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:06,650
distributor or bringing in one of our

77
00:03:04,099 --> 00:03:08,960
sub or other you know ways of extracting

78
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:11,780
it so I mean there's and that's a need

79
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:13,969
that's a fit so and also pre-rolls we do

80
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:16,009
pre-rolls white labeling we do okay all

81
00:03:13,969 --> 00:03:17,509
kinds of stuff I think this is why I

82
00:03:16,009 --> 00:03:19,489
find it so fascinating it's just like

83
00:03:17,509 --> 00:03:22,129
fascinating you know what you guys are

84
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:25,760
doing for the market and how deep it

85
00:03:22,129 --> 00:03:27,620
gets and so it's super exciting and one

86
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:29,329
of the questions that I have is like a

87
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:31,700
lawyer you know we want to see a lot of

88
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:33,350
written agreements like what does it

89
00:03:31,699 --> 00:03:35,629
look like the contracts that you're

90
00:03:33,349 --> 00:03:37,099
seeing today with the farmers are their

91
00:03:35,629 --> 00:03:39,469
written agreements what are the primary

92
00:03:37,099 --> 00:03:41,180
terms like what are the just kind of

93
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:46,609
basics that you're seeing in terms of

94
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:49,219
these you know whatever the agreements

95
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:51,800
with farmers or manufacturers are as for

96
00:03:49,219 --> 00:03:53,689
distro when do you take title when do

97
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:55,130
you not take title do you need a motor

98
00:03:53,689 --> 00:03:56,900
carrier permit if you're gonna go pick

99
00:03:55,129 --> 00:03:59,569
it up from them and not buy it so they

100
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:01,250
get you know until after a CoA like what

101
00:03:59,569 --> 00:04:03,259
are the weirdness that you're seeing in

102
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:05,750
the actual agreement that you're

103
00:04:03,259 --> 00:04:08,719
wrestling out right now cuz I imagine

104
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:09,620
it's got to be complex and so novel and

105
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:11,359
it's the first time it's ever happened

106
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:12,980
there is no industry that does it quite

107
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,120
like this so what are you guys seeing in

108
00:04:12,979 --> 00:04:17,329
terms of those written agreements and

109
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:18,590
how does that work so my only experience

110
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:21,649
have written agreements are the ones

111
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:23,269
coming from our company the so far from

112
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:26,389
all the transactions we've done I have

113
00:04:23,269 --> 00:04:27,949
not seen yet seen one document come from

114
00:04:26,389 --> 00:04:32,089
any other entity so that's been really

115
00:04:27,949 --> 00:04:34,310
bizarre as far as our contracts with our

116
00:04:32,089 --> 00:04:36,679
supply chain partners we do a

117
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:39,530
consignment contract so we can come pick

118
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:42,168
up your flower or your product bring

119
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:43,639
that in-house have a target price and

120
00:04:42,168 --> 00:04:43,968
then be able to sell that the supply

121
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:46,579
chain

122
00:04:43,968 --> 00:04:49,428
we pay bi-weekly depending on what sells

123
00:04:46,579 --> 00:04:52,158
that's one contract that we have then we

124
00:04:49,428 --> 00:04:54,558
have a direct purchase contract so we

125
00:04:52,158 --> 00:04:56,389
pay upfront you know when we take in the

126
00:04:54,559 --> 00:04:59,389
money from the buyer and bring it into

127
00:04:56,389 --> 00:05:01,819
our distro as an escrow obviously do the

128
00:04:59,389 --> 00:05:03,978
QC and the rnd test before we procure it

129
00:05:01,819 --> 00:05:06,679
and all that procurement work bring that

130
00:05:03,978 --> 00:05:07,878
in and then pay the farmer so that seems

131
00:05:06,678 --> 00:05:09,408
to be pretty black-and-white and

132
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:12,110
straightforward now we're developing

133
00:05:09,408 --> 00:05:14,598
contracts around this integrated

134
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:16,939
partnership model that I spoke of so you

135
00:05:14,598 --> 00:05:18,408
know depending on that farmers business

136
00:05:16,939 --> 00:05:20,419
model they're all very very different

137
00:05:18,408 --> 00:05:22,098
you would think it's oh you know growing

138
00:05:20,418 --> 00:05:24,019
wheat but know everybody's kind of got

139
00:05:22,098 --> 00:05:26,088
their own strengths in it so now we're

140
00:05:24,019 --> 00:05:28,759
really trying to streamline our contract

141
00:05:26,088 --> 00:05:31,249
for either a split contract toll

142
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:33,679
processing to where you can give me your

143
00:05:31,249 --> 00:05:36,110
flower we extract the whole thing and

144
00:05:33,678 --> 00:05:38,028
then we split the revenues depending on

145
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:41,598
the operational cost those comes off the

146
00:05:38,028 --> 00:05:43,728
top or we can do an output model so

147
00:05:41,598 --> 00:05:45,079
depending on the yield the grams that

148
00:05:43,728 --> 00:05:46,668
come out the farmers get paid

149
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:49,129
accordingly that's another type of toll

150
00:05:46,668 --> 00:05:50,718
processing and then there's a few

151
00:05:49,129 --> 00:05:52,189
different companies actually a couple of

152
00:05:50,718 --> 00:05:54,379
distribution companies that are industry

153
00:05:52,189 --> 00:05:56,509
pioneers as well as a processing company

154
00:05:54,379 --> 00:05:58,759
who's really moving forward on this

155
00:05:56,509 --> 00:06:01,338
really unique model that I like they

156
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:04,639
have anything in the name of the

157
00:06:01,338 --> 00:06:06,259
structure but it's they manage the farms

158
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,869
in a way where they'll come to the farm

159
00:06:06,259 --> 00:06:11,449
once a month make sure everything is

160
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:12,769
passing test look at their IPM make sure

161
00:06:11,449 --> 00:06:15,049
everything's gonna pass to us and

162
00:06:12,769 --> 00:06:17,538
provide that that management service in

163
00:06:15,048 --> 00:06:20,328
a way that oversight along with

164
00:06:17,538 --> 00:06:22,968
potential capital injection initially so

165
00:06:20,329 --> 00:06:24,799
subsidizing the farm with either clones

166
00:06:22,968 --> 00:06:26,959
or capital to maintain their their

167
00:06:24,798 --> 00:06:28,908
operations and then at the end of the

168
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:30,949
harvest it's kind of a set price per

169
00:06:28,908 --> 00:06:33,110
square foot that sold back to that other

170
00:06:30,949 --> 00:06:34,999
entity and then they take that flower

171
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:37,309
and either extract it or sell it for top

172
00:06:34,999 --> 00:06:38,719
depending on the relationship so I think

173
00:06:37,309 --> 00:06:40,519
it's really interesting out there

174
00:06:38,718 --> 00:06:42,528
there's a lot of really great ways that

175
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:44,179
all the supply chain partners are

176
00:06:42,528 --> 00:06:46,278
linking together and figuring it out

177
00:06:44,178 --> 00:06:48,408
depending on you know whatever ones

178
00:06:46,278 --> 00:06:50,370
focus is so if you want to talk more

179
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:51,779
about it we have a booth over there

180
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:53,490
and it kind of spells out our three

181
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:55,679
different models for these integrated

182
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:57,569
partnerships for farms and we'll have

183
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,668
our contracts ready for those very

184
00:06:57,569 --> 00:07:02,040
shortly in addition to that we also have

185
00:06:59,668 --> 00:07:03,719
a nursery in mindo so supplying genetics

186
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:06,419
and making sure all of these clones are

187
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:08,850
clean really offsets that upfront cost

188
00:07:06,418 --> 00:07:10,560
for farmers to and just streamline

189
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:12,030
everyone's everyone's integration and

190
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,100
tensions for the year so we're really

191
00:07:12,029 --> 00:07:16,168
excited about that and we need to keep

192
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,970
our machines fed we need to have exact

193
00:07:16,168 --> 00:07:20,329
oils for all of our brands and products

194
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:22,800
and then the brands we work with need

195
00:07:20,329 --> 00:07:25,800
specific strains so there's a lot of

196
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,569
opportunity to really sync up depending

197
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:31,250
on what your focus is and so where

198
00:07:27,569 --> 00:07:31,250
you're growing for a purpose every year

199
00:07:32,209 --> 00:07:38,519
so we've been moving towards more of a

200
00:07:35,089 --> 00:07:40,409
once once once we receive COAS cashing

201
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:42,899
out then before we're doing in terms

202
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:44,580
model and so now we've contracts I'm a

203
00:07:42,899 --> 00:07:46,439
presence a lawyer so she's been managing

204
00:07:44,579 --> 00:07:48,089
a lot of that I literally just managed

205
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:50,069
law just the sales end so I can't really

206
00:07:48,089 --> 00:07:51,509
tell you a lot of the contracts comes

207
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:53,219
from when were procuring but I'll tell

208
00:07:51,509 --> 00:07:55,349
you that like we've seen an evolution of

209
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:57,300
like contracts with manufacturers and

210
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:58,979
about what splits in the mid what

211
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:01,470
happens after split one thing that we

212
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:02,939
found kind of hard figure out I mean he

213
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:05,880
was Uzi figure out but was Harlan they

214
00:08:02,939 --> 00:08:07,379
didn't have the velocity was we wanted

215
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:10,319
them and take all the product and then

216
00:08:07,379 --> 00:08:11,879
do a split afterwards because we're

217
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,560
distributor in sales and that just

218
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:15,300
became kind of hard so going through

219
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,769
contacts kind of figuring out where the

220
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:19,720
weak points are that's them they're

221
00:08:16,769 --> 00:08:21,539
doing special involvement partners

222
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:23,770
[Music]

223
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:26,050
contracts are great handshakes are

224
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:28,289
better but contracts are great I'll

225
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:31,329
never give up the handshake

226
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:33,250
yeahit's we do a split for all of our

227
00:08:31,329 --> 00:08:36,659
extracts we can do we do the split

228
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:38,710
there's a or we'll / do a purchase

229
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:42,279
number different ways you hit it really

230
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:44,440
well we do a consignment a consignment

231
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:47,350
first of all our contracts are thorough

232
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:51,250
they've been you know crafted and

233
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:53,110
created from our attorneys and they're

234
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:54,850
legit like they really are and other

235
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:57,310
attorneys I've read them and called us

236
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:58,600
up and said am yeah you not only cover

237
00:08:57,309 --> 00:08:59,889
yourself which is good like I said

238
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:02,860
earlier we want to cover the whole

239
00:08:59,889 --> 00:09:04,720
relationship with a cultivator too so a

240
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:05,200
lot of contracts that I've written I've

241
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,779
written

242
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:10,060
I mean I've written I've read are

243
00:09:07,779 --> 00:09:11,980
completely one-sided that cultivators

244
00:09:10,059 --> 00:09:15,459
are signing and they are losing their

245
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:17,110
asses it's bad it's so sad but there's a

246
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:18,940
lot of distributors out there that do

247
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:21,430
not care about you know that right out

248
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:24,010
the gate but there's some and I know

249
00:09:21,429 --> 00:09:25,019
these ones sitting up here we do care

250
00:09:24,009 --> 00:09:28,600
about you

251
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:31,509
probably why we're invited to this but

252
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:35,409
for for contracts we could do it we do

253
00:09:31,509 --> 00:09:38,799
we started out with a 60 after after

254
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:41,169
testing was approved right but 60 day

255
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:42,849
payout or if it comes out earlier than

256
00:09:41,169 --> 00:09:44,409
that it comes there's been at one

257
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:46,029
instance that we had some issues it

258
00:09:44,409 --> 00:09:48,100
extended out but for the most part we've

259
00:09:46,029 --> 00:09:51,579
we've held and we paid pretty pretty

260
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:53,680
well or before that we did do some we

261
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:55,720
have purchased contracts as well for

262
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:56,919
those you know great value you need to

263
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:59,529
get rid of something you know we have a

264
00:09:56,919 --> 00:10:01,329
purchase contract set up and then the

265
00:09:59,529 --> 00:10:03,759
same thing with the extracts we do a lot

266
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:05,230
of different biomass contracts you know

267
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:07,360
I have a lot of different markets for a

268
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:10,690
lot of different things to land but the

269
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:13,750
problem is logistics and and price point

270
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:18,340
and negotiating that at the

271
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:19,690
manufacturing level for for a biomass

272
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:21,220
and all and everything's so change

273
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:25,300
there's no model that's been set or

274
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:27,580
created yet and for me I self I'm

275
00:10:25,299 --> 00:10:29,409
self-made right I don't have any there's

276
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:31,250
no venture capitalist you know on me

277
00:10:29,409 --> 00:10:32,899
whatsoever every penny

278
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:34,909
ever made I threw it in front of me and

279
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:37,699
I'm standing here today still owning

280
00:10:34,909 --> 00:10:39,469
myself so I'm not sitting where I can

281
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:41,990
write a you know 200 thousand dollar

282
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:44,660
check to buy a cultivators product up

283
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:47,210
front but I'm also gonna pay you within

284
00:10:44,659 --> 00:10:49,639
the time of the contract so you know

285
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:52,100
it's it's still it's a crazy it's a

286
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:54,470
crazy model out there there's everything

287
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:56,509
and it's ever it's it's always changing

288
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:58,670
I'm sure you guys can see us what worked

289
00:10:56,509 --> 00:11:01,819
two weeks ago is totally different now

290
00:10:58,669 --> 00:11:04,399
right because it's it hasn't been done I

291
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:07,100
don't care what distributor who has 30

292
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:08,509
years in the alcohol industry and he's

293
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:10,879
telling you he knows what they're doing

294
00:11:08,509 --> 00:11:13,069
or she knows what they're doing yeah

295
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:14,659
this industry hasn't been done if one if

296
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:16,820
a person says I've been in alcohol

297
00:11:14,659 --> 00:11:21,469
industry and I know distribution walk

298
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:23,300
away immediately walk away I think to

299
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:25,279
one of the things that really concerns

300
00:11:23,299 --> 00:11:27,349
me sometimes as some of the distributors

301
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,370
or purchasers it doesn't necessarily

302
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:30,050
need to be a distributor where the

303
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:31,940
contracts don't make sense like they're

304
00:11:30,049 --> 00:11:33,859
not written in plain language they're

305
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:36,380
run in very legalese it's hard to like

306
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:38,930
connect with usually that's a red flag

307
00:11:36,379 --> 00:11:41,179
to me like if we can't understand it as

308
00:11:38,929 --> 00:11:43,459
just humans you know it sounds nada

309
00:11:41,179 --> 00:11:45,500
songs not right so it's something to

310
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:47,509
think about in terms of like looking at

311
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,889
contracts and also having a distributor

312
00:11:47,509 --> 00:11:51,080
who's willing to negotiate those terms

313
00:11:48,889 --> 00:11:52,580
with you because like you said you know

314
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:55,280
we're here for the first time like

315
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:56,930
nobody's done this before so you know we

316
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:58,669
can present some kind of language but

317
00:11:56,929 --> 00:12:00,229
doesn't necessarily mean that when we

318
00:11:58,669 --> 00:12:02,360
present it and somebody says well what

319
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:03,920
about this scenario you know we haven't

320
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:05,269
thought about that scenario so we think

321
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:06,529
about it together and then we create

322
00:12:05,269 --> 00:12:08,539
something together that works for all of

323
00:12:06,529 --> 00:12:09,889
us that's kind of how I feel those good

324
00:12:08,539 --> 00:12:13,099
relationships are going to be born out

325
00:12:09,889 --> 00:12:17,000
you know it's recently seen a distro

326
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:20,629
contract that said they had a 40% on

327
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:23,089
their contract disto dystrophy 40%

328
00:12:20,629 --> 00:12:24,799
they held 200 pounds and couldn't get

329
00:12:23,089 --> 00:12:26,180
rid of it I'm taking the product away

330
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:27,679
from that district I'm not going to name

331
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:32,809
it what it is but what are the other

332
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:34,159
douchebags in the industry okay so it's

333
00:12:32,809 --> 00:12:36,229
time for us to get off but just a quick

334
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:38,600
closing thought like are you guys seeing

335
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:40,250
any trends and distribution anything

336
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:42,350
that you're seeing that is a positive

337
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:44,870
it's a negative what do you guys see you

338
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:45,500
just like a two-second summary of what

339
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:47,480
your company

340
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:48,769
it's providing and what you guys see

341
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:50,120
we're going for the future and just

342
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:51,730
something that we can kind of latch on

343
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:53,810
to and look forward to in the future

344
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:57,019
yeah I'm really excited to see a lot

345
00:12:53,809 --> 00:12:59,209
more collaboration last year you know

346
00:12:57,019 --> 00:13:01,129
with coming out of the shadows as you

347
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:02,450
call it it's really nerve-racking for a

348
00:13:01,129 --> 00:13:04,669
lot of people who've been in the space

349
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:06,200
not only that but seeing all the big

350
00:13:04,669 --> 00:13:08,659
capital coming in the new companies

351
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:10,100
coming in and everyone's really used to

352
00:13:08,659 --> 00:13:11,809
being very private

353
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:14,629
not necessarily trusting and really

354
00:13:11,809 --> 00:13:16,699
working by themselves over the last year

355
00:13:14,629 --> 00:13:19,370
I've seen that dramatically shift people

356
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:21,980
are coming together in cooperatives as

357
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:24,019
Hezekiah was talking about other supply

358
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:26,330
chain and stakeholder partners who were

359
00:13:24,019 --> 00:13:28,309
sharing information and linking arms

360
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:30,080
together a big distributors that are all

361
00:13:28,309 --> 00:13:31,699
pioneers want to work with only the

362
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:34,430
pioneer companies and really stick to

363
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:36,410
that model so I'm really really happy to

364
00:13:34,429 --> 00:13:38,509
see the collaboration I think it's one

365
00:13:36,409 --> 00:13:40,279
thing that has been missing in the last

366
00:13:38,509 --> 00:13:42,679
couple of decades that I've been in

367
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:44,899
cannabis in a way of really sharing

368
00:13:42,679 --> 00:13:46,250
resources creating coops for

369
00:13:44,899 --> 00:13:48,199
efficiencies and what you're purchasing

370
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:50,090
streamlining genetics and really keeping

371
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:52,460
that operational cost as low as as

372
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:54,769
possible at the end of the day it's very

373
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:56,509
important for cultivation so I am

374
00:13:54,769 --> 00:13:58,189
excited to see that people coming

375
00:13:56,509 --> 00:14:00,860
together I think Humboldt has really led

376
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:02,180
the way in that regard and they were one

377
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:04,519
of the first counties to allow

378
00:14:02,179 --> 00:14:06,469
cultivation and I've got several events

379
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:07,970
up there and the hcg a the humble

380
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:09,920
Growers Association and you see these

381
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:11,990
just old-school farmers coming together

382
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:14,360
and it's stronger together you know is

383
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:15,740
that mission and we've really are so

384
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:18,019
they've really paved the way and it's

385
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:20,299
exciting to see Nevada County now taking

386
00:14:18,019 --> 00:14:22,460
steps towards that as well I'm excited

387
00:14:20,299 --> 00:14:24,379
to see who's you know come forward and

388
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:27,470
got licensing and we're here to support

389
00:14:24,379 --> 00:14:29,299
we're based out in about a city happy to

390
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:31,009
have anybody come in and talk to any of

391
00:14:29,299 --> 00:14:33,409
us about ways that we can plug in

392
00:14:31,009 --> 00:14:35,090
together and integrate your farms and

393
00:14:33,409 --> 00:14:39,370
with all of all of the sales and the

394
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:39,370
supply chain efforts so thank you

395
00:14:45,649 --> 00:14:47,708
you
