2
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:30,179
one of the things that I've really

3
00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:32,878
noticed about this industry is moving

4
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:36,929
from kind of the shadows into the

5
00:00:32,878 --> 00:00:41,609
corporate world is not an easy walk and

6
00:00:36,929 --> 00:00:43,979
some of you have difficulty in really

7
00:00:41,609 --> 00:00:46,109
understanding the kind of regulations

8
00:00:43,979 --> 00:00:48,988
the laws that you are now bound by

9
00:00:46,109 --> 00:00:50,119
because it's legal congratulations and

10
00:00:48,988 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm sorry

11
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:57,448
so it's it's a double-edged sword

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
so you know when I talked to you the

13
00:00:57,448 --> 00:01:02,218
owner of a cannabis company and I say

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,209
you can't call every single one of your

15
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:08,519
employees contractors or you can't give

16
00:01:06,209 --> 00:01:10,319
everyone a salary and call it a day you

17
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:13,199
just can't do that anymore because of

18
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:15,689
wage and hour laws I get a little

19
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,820
pushback and what I hear most is well

20
00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:20,429
that's the way I've always done it and I

21
00:01:17,819 --> 00:01:23,669
get it totally get it totally understand

22
00:01:20,429 --> 00:01:26,609
and and really it's my job to to help

23
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:29,549
you understand to very gently help you

24
00:01:26,609 --> 00:01:32,400
understand why now that you are legal

25
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:34,380
you're in a legal industry you really

26
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,540
have to start paying attention to some

27
00:01:34,379 --> 00:01:39,569
of this stuff and it's not it's not

28
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:42,630
interesting it is not sexy it's not fun

29
00:01:39,569 --> 00:01:45,179
it's it's the law and we'll have Rocco

30
00:01:42,629 --> 00:01:48,118
go into that into more detail but really

31
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:50,790
my purpose in helping out the cannabis

32
00:01:48,118 --> 00:01:54,030
industry is to really look at the little

33
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:56,460
guy the up-and-comer that has a small

34
00:01:54,030 --> 00:02:00,570
company has you know maybe a couple

35
00:01:56,459 --> 00:02:04,500
three ten employees and we need to get

36
00:02:00,569 --> 00:02:06,658
you poised to really to grow and to grow

37
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:09,179
in a way that you're going to be

38
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:11,189
protected because there's a lot of

39
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:14,129
little nuances out there that you have

40
00:02:11,189 --> 00:02:16,229
to be aware of you know now you're

41
00:02:14,129 --> 00:02:18,509
looking at wage and hour laws now you're

42
00:02:16,229 --> 00:02:20,578
looking at you know employee versus

43
00:02:18,509 --> 00:02:22,409
versus consultant you're looking at a

44
00:02:20,579 --> 00:02:24,510
lot of things now that you didn't have

45
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:25,650
to look at before you know I'm not

46
00:02:24,509 --> 00:02:28,739
physically May

47
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:30,510
you money but in the long run we save

48
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:32,789
you money you know by making sure that

49
00:02:30,509 --> 00:02:34,739
you're compliant I'm a labor and

50
00:02:32,789 --> 00:02:37,109
employment lawyer by trade and I'm

51
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:40,469
geeking out in sort of a nerdy way that

52
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:42,659
there is an event like this happening in

53
00:02:40,469 --> 00:02:45,120
the cannabis space I came to cannabis

54
00:02:42,658 --> 00:02:46,408
through labor employment law with a lot

55
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,590
of my traditional clients outside

56
00:02:46,408 --> 00:02:51,269
cannabis saying hey somebody who came to

57
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:52,469
work and they tested positive for

58
00:02:51,269 --> 00:02:54,510
cannabis I heard it's legal in

59
00:02:52,469 --> 00:02:57,060
California can we still screen them out

60
00:02:54,509 --> 00:02:58,620
from employment standpoint a lot of our

61
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:01,139
clients were doing business with the

62
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:03,930
cannabis industry selling them bags or

63
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:05,700
glass or other materials and saying how

64
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:08,700
do we how do we work with this industry

65
00:03:05,699 --> 00:03:11,128
so coming into it several years ago and

66
00:03:08,699 --> 00:03:14,009
and then launching a cannabis practice

67
00:03:11,128 --> 00:03:16,138
group and being really focused on the

68
00:03:14,009 --> 00:03:18,658
front end with regulatory reforms and

69
00:03:16,139 --> 00:03:20,400
licensing and whispering in people's

70
00:03:18,658 --> 00:03:21,750
ears for the last five years hey you

71
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,120
probably should pay attention to labor

72
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:25,829
and employment law at some point it's

73
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,599
it's exciting that we're actually there

74
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:30,750
and people are getting past the

75
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:34,138
licensing point and and now starting to

76
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:35,939
look at these issues in addition to

77
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:38,099
being a labor employment lawyer and a

78
00:03:35,939 --> 00:03:40,469
partner and a firm here in Los Angeles I

79
00:03:38,098 --> 00:03:42,479
also serve as the HR committee chair for

80
00:03:40,469 --> 00:03:45,389
the California cannabis Industry

81
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:48,869
Association and if there's anybody here

82
00:03:45,389 --> 00:03:51,269
who works in HR or who wears the HR hat

83
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:53,759
for their organization I would plead

84
00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:56,908
with you beg you

85
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:59,608
please come see me so that we can get

86
00:03:56,908 --> 00:04:01,769
you wrapped into that group there's some

87
00:03:59,609 --> 00:04:03,799
very good people some very sophisticated

88
00:04:01,769 --> 00:04:06,150
some very smart people on that committee

89
00:04:03,799 --> 00:04:07,590
but the thing that I have trouble with

90
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:10,139
is reaching out and getting a lot of

91
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:11,699
industry participants to come and share

92
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:16,049
sort of their headaches and what's going

93
00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:17,728
on and as a as a CCI a chair we're

94
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:19,649
really trying to deliver information and

95
00:04:17,728 --> 00:04:21,689
practical advice to the the industry so

96
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:23,189
I can tell you what I think is important

97
00:04:21,689 --> 00:04:25,129
but if it doesn't really land for you

98
00:04:23,189 --> 00:04:28,160
guys

99
00:04:25,129 --> 00:04:32,810
it's it's a waste of time in those

100
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:34,700
discussions with the CCIA the work that

101
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:37,040
I'm being asked to do for clients inside

102
00:04:34,699 --> 00:04:39,709
the cannabis industry my number one

103
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:42,770
concern is as Lynn alluded to is the way

104
00:04:39,709 --> 00:04:45,979
people are paying people in cannabis and

105
00:04:42,769 --> 00:04:49,159
I get why it happened it's a banking

106
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:51,439
issue and people came out of a cash

107
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:53,570
based system with with no ability to

108
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:56,089
bank and a lot of cash sitting around

109
00:04:53,569 --> 00:04:58,849
and it's just easier to start calling

110
00:04:56,089 --> 00:05:01,609
people paid volunteers which is sort of

111
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:02,900
an oxymoron or a contractor or or

112
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:05,480
whatever you want to call them and pay

113
00:05:02,899 --> 00:05:08,179
them cash and quite frankly a lot of

114
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:10,490
times pay them very well in cash but no

115
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:12,680
good deed goes unpunished to businesses

116
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:14,030
in a regulated market and I will tell

117
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:17,509
you without going too deep in the weeds

118
00:05:14,029 --> 00:05:19,879
if you're not if you have employees that

119
00:05:17,509 --> 00:05:21,589
are working for you people that are

120
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:23,839
doing what it is you do as a business

121
00:05:21,589 --> 00:05:25,939
people that don't work for companies

122
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:27,769
outside of you

123
00:05:25,939 --> 00:05:29,149
those people are employees if you're not

124
00:05:27,769 --> 00:05:31,279
treating them as employees if you're not

125
00:05:29,149 --> 00:05:32,439
calling them employees and if you're not

126
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:35,329
paying them the right way

127
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:36,949
today it's okay but the statute of

128
00:05:35,329 --> 00:05:40,099
limitations on a wage and hour claim is

129
00:05:36,949 --> 00:05:41,839
for years and it's not unheard of for us

130
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:43,189
to settle class actions for wage and

131
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:45,859
hour liability in the millions of

132
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:48,769
dollars they will kill your business and

133
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:50,750
it's little things along the way in

134
00:05:48,769 --> 00:05:52,370
terms of the way that you classify them

135
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:54,199
the way that you track their hours if

136
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:57,620
they're they're eligible for overtime

137
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:59,060
wages the way that you pay them those

138
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:00,769
little things can be set up on the front

139
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:02,839
end for you to be successful in the long

140
00:06:00,769 --> 00:06:03,979
run and for those of you that think well

141
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:05,839
Dean I can't get a banking relationship

142
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:08,720
or I have difficulty with the payroll

143
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:11,869
solution I will tell you that it's an

144
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,820
increasingly problem of the past so come

145
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:15,949
find me come find some of the other

146
00:06:13,819 --> 00:06:18,920
people that are out here we can help you

147
00:06:15,949 --> 00:06:21,860
solve that sort of a problem so the wage

148
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:25,400
and hour piece is a very very big

149
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:27,590
problem for the industry I see a

150
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:29,509
receptiveness to changing but but we

151
00:06:27,589 --> 00:06:31,489
have to get better there and the other

152
00:06:29,509 --> 00:06:33,500
part beyond the way we pay people the

153
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:35,269
way that companies are set up from an HR

154
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:38,089
standpoint in terms of onboarding people

155
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:40,389
having policies and procedures dealing

156
00:06:38,089 --> 00:06:43,459
with issues as they come up

157
00:06:40,389 --> 00:06:45,228
quite frankly a lot of small cannabis

158
00:06:43,459 --> 00:06:47,089
companies were started on a handshake

159
00:06:45,228 --> 00:06:50,539
with a couple of friends who knew each

160
00:06:47,089 --> 00:06:52,310
other from past business dealings the

161
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:53,780
more sophisticated you get the more

162
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:56,209
money you take in from private

163
00:06:53,779 --> 00:06:57,500
investment the bigger you grow the more

164
00:06:56,209 --> 00:06:59,509
employees are going to have that no

165
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:01,490
longer went to college with you that

166
00:06:59,509 --> 00:07:05,300
were no longer or referral from your

167
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:06,620
relatives and family members and if god

168
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,360
forbid there's a downturn in the market

169
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:11,449
and you have to start laying people off

170
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:13,430
or firing them the tide will come out

171
00:07:11,449 --> 00:07:15,949
and if you're not doing things right in

172
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:18,530
terms of the way that you manage people

173
00:07:15,949 --> 00:07:20,240
as employees talk to them about their

174
00:07:18,529 --> 00:07:22,579
performance issues when you go to fire

175
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,800
them if it's a surprise you're going to

176
00:07:22,579 --> 00:07:27,050
get wrongful termination discrimination

177
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,759
retaliation claims and so there's a lot

178
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:31,520
of again very simple things that you can

179
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:34,039
do on the front end to build your HR

180
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:36,709
function to have policies and procedures

181
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:38,390
in place to teach your managers how to

182
00:07:36,709 --> 00:07:41,120
deal with people on performance issues

183
00:07:38,389 --> 00:07:42,860
that can really manage a lot of that so

184
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,079
those are really the two big things that

185
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:47,060
I see on the front end is we come out of

186
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:48,800
licensing and everybody's cheerful that

187
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:52,370
we got that license that we've been

188
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,449
struggling to get for the last year now

189
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:55,160
that you go back to running your

190
00:07:53,449 --> 00:07:57,079
business and trying to move at a profit

191
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:58,310
those are the main two things that I

192
00:07:57,079 --> 00:08:02,060
would encourage everybody in this room

193
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:04,040
to focus on in a short time and I would

194
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:06,649
also like to add that in through my

195
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:08,990
years of experience one of the saddest

196
00:08:06,649 --> 00:08:12,569
things that I've seen you know in in

197
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:14,280
businesses just any kind of business is

198
00:08:12,569 --> 00:08:16,199
the people that you're closest to

199
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:19,889
building it are the people that

200
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:22,979
sometimes you have a really severe

201
00:08:19,889 --> 00:08:26,519
falling out with I've seen so many

202
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:29,460
managers that have had one employee and

203
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:32,100
they're just the best best of friends

204
00:08:29,459 --> 00:08:34,439
and then something in the in the

205
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:36,180
business changes maybe financially

206
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:38,720
you're having to make cutbacks maybe

207
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:40,620
you're having to decrease pay because

208
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:43,470
financially you're just it's either

209
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:47,419
decrease pay or lay people off and I've

210
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:51,389
seen really strong relationships go sour

211
00:08:47,419 --> 00:08:54,029
quickly and it's so hurtful to everybody

212
00:08:51,389 --> 00:08:56,939
involved so in order to protect that

213
00:08:54,029 --> 00:08:59,759
it's it's really a good thing to put

214
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:02,790
policies and procedures in place and and

215
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:05,159
the one the one word that I encourage

216
00:09:02,789 --> 00:09:08,519
you to stay away from for your entire

217
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:11,909
career is special it's a special deal

218
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:14,460
he's a special case that word will get

219
00:09:11,909 --> 00:09:17,189
you in more trouble because everyone in

220
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:19,560
the company will want to be special so

221
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:22,110
it's really good to put policies and

222
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:23,969
procedures in place and I don't live and

223
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:25,830
die by policies I don't care what

224
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:28,080
policies you put in place but once you

225
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:30,450
put them there you know you really need

226
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:33,240
to try and adhere to them and it's

227
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:36,330
really it's it's Italy it's give a

228
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,889
spirit of fairness to your staff and you

229
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:38,879
know if you're fair to your staff

230
00:09:37,889 --> 00:09:42,379
company-wide

231
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:45,000
you kind of alleviate a lot of issues

232
00:09:42,379 --> 00:09:47,519
throughout your entire you know

233
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,549
experience in a company so the one word

234
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:53,069
you want to stay away from is special no

235
00:09:50,549 --> 00:09:55,409
special treatment no special people

236
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:57,540
those are the those are the issues that

237
00:09:55,409 --> 00:10:00,779
will you will see yourself in so many

238
00:09:57,539 --> 00:10:02,909
meetings with other employees because

239
00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:04,709
you you treated somebody else better or

240
00:10:02,909 --> 00:10:06,289
you know you can tell them don't tell

241
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:08,939
how much you make

242
00:10:06,289 --> 00:10:10,919

243
00:10:08,938 --> 00:10:13,919

that anybody that manufactures cannabis

258
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:57,420

within 90 days for any one of their

261
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:05,039
employees who is part of the process of

262
00:11:02,549 --> 00:11:08,878
creating your cannabis manufactured

263
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:11,240
goods as of today in the state of

264
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:14,308
California we have certified

265
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:18,209
approximately 11 manufacturers of

266
00:11:14,308 --> 00:11:19,948
cannabis Goods that number sucks so I

267
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:22,558
know that there's at least 11 of you

268
00:11:19,948 --> 00:11:24,419
here and I've only seen one person in

269
00:11:22,558 --> 00:11:26,219
this audience that I've actually given

270
00:11:24,419 --> 00:11:29,519
the serf safety certification class to

271
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:31,110
how many of you guys have 30 is how many

272
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,558
of you guys have had your employees do

273
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:38,419
the serve sake certification class oh

274
00:11:33,558 --> 00:11:40,620
come on so you guys are talking about HR

275
00:11:38,419 --> 00:11:43,708
we have been providing these surf safe

276
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:45,870
certification classes for decades it's

277
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:48,138
the traditional service aid class we

278
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:50,730
customized it completely for cannabis

279
00:11:48,139 --> 00:11:52,799
and it's a traditional three and a half

280
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:54,300
hour class it's good for three years

281
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:56,128
your employees can take that

282
00:11:54,299 --> 00:11:59,429
certification to any manufacturing

283
00:11:56,129 --> 00:12:02,490
facility that they go to and we also

284
00:11:59,429 --> 00:12:06,388
have for the dispensary owners we

285
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:08,250
provide a class that is a similar to

286
00:12:06,389 --> 00:12:10,680
responsible alcohol program it's a

287
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:12,620
responsible vendor program and we teach

288
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:15,250
your employees your main

289
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:17,990
and sometimes owners of dispensaries

290
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:21,730
invert in regards to the state

291
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:25,070
regulations for safety checking IDs

292
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:26,779
security what the law is about selling

293
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:29,690
cannabis so we basically have a

294
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:32,659
responsible vendor program that helps

295
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:34,640
you keep your employees trained at the

296
00:12:32,659 --> 00:12:36,559
state level it does not require or say

297
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:38,929
anything in specifics about what the

298
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:41,869
training needs to be but the local level

299
00:12:38,929 --> 00:12:44,059
is where the requirements are for a

300
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:46,190
responsible vendor program we actually

301
00:12:44,059 --> 00:12:48,889
have had several counties reach out to

302
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:50,570
us because in their local jurisdiction

303
00:12:48,889 --> 00:12:53,480
in their cannabis regulations at the

304
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:54,650
local level they have a responsive ended

305
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:57,529
program written into their local

306
00:12:54,649 --> 00:13:00,889
regulations that requires the employees

307
00:12:57,529 --> 00:13:03,379
to be trained at a local level excuse me

308
00:13:00,889 --> 00:13:05,689
of a budtender level or even manager

309
00:13:03,379 --> 00:13:08,600
level before that employee starts

310
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:10,190
working on the floor so we have had

311
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,960
those counties reach out to us we've

312
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:14,180
provided them our curriculum they've

313
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:16,250
approved it and we have gone all the way

314
00:13:14,179 --> 00:13:18,829
out to Mono County in Mammoth Mountain

315
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:20,179
and done responsible vendor programs to

316
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:21,740
two of the dispensaries out there

317
00:13:20,179 --> 00:13:25,009
there's several more of them that are

318
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:27,379
coming on board the reason why training

319
00:13:25,009 --> 00:13:29,990
your employees is a value is that it

320
00:13:27,379 --> 00:13:32,360
creates a retention for you as an

321
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:35,330
employer so if you train your employees

322
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:38,330
and they know what's expected of them

323
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:40,400
they're more than likely to stay you

324
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:42,080
have provided camp key performance

325
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:43,610
indicators for them to know what's

326
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:46,610
expected of them when they arrive at

327
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:48,200
work and also what the law is what the

328
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:49,759
regulations are and what the

329
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:52,100
requirements are for what they need to

330
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:53,689
do to do their job like I said at the

331
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:55,790
surf safe requirement for the food

332
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:57,080
safety class that's a requirement of the

333
00:13:55,789 --> 00:14:00,379
California Department of Public Health

334
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:02,389
and you have 90 days to have your

335
00:14:00,379 --> 00:14:05,360
employees trained in that servsafe

336
00:14:02,389 --> 00:14:08,149
certification and when the regulator's

337
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:10,490
walk in to do a certification of your

338
00:14:08,149 --> 00:14:12,019
facility and they give you a pass at the

339
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:14,049
Department of Public Health level and

340
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:15,980
they see a whole bunch of servsafe

341
00:14:14,049 --> 00:14:19,009
certifications all over your kitchen

342
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:21,230
they smile because they know that this

343
00:14:19,009 --> 00:14:23,360
this manufacturer has taken the

344
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:24,528
necessary steps to certify their

345
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,930
employees for food

346
00:14:24,528 --> 00:14:29,360
I mean I've walked into some food safety

347
00:14:26,929 --> 00:14:32,508
into some manufacturers and there's been

348
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:35,449
barrels of acetone with no lids on them

349
00:14:32,509 --> 00:14:37,370
in the kitchen and I'm like what are you

350
00:14:35,448 --> 00:14:39,549
guys doing you can't have this in your

351
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:42,769
kitchen this is like completely

352
00:14:39,549 --> 00:14:45,708
prohibitive and they're like what like

353
00:14:42,769 --> 00:14:47,269
what right back get it out you can't

354
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:49,758
have this in your kitchen so her

355
00:14:47,269 --> 00:14:51,259
question was it does an individual have

356
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:53,600
to be part of a company or a

357
00:14:51,259 --> 00:14:55,308
manufacturer of cannabis goods to take

358
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,290
the serve safe certification class and

359
00:14:55,308 --> 00:15:00,318
the answer is no they do not have to be

360
00:14:57,289 --> 00:15:01,490
part of a manufacturer a cannabis

361
00:15:00,318 --> 00:15:04,370
manufacturer they can come take the

362
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:07,159
class anytime my name is Jacqueline

363
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:10,149
shuttin I'm a researcher with UFCW Local

364
00:15:07,159 --> 00:15:13,278
770 we're in labor union that represents

365
00:15:10,149 --> 00:15:16,519
retail and food workers along with

366
00:15:13,278 --> 00:15:18,759
pharmacists in LA County Ventura County

367
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:21,948
Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo County

368
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:24,499
we've been fighting for legalization

369
00:15:21,948 --> 00:15:27,008
marijuana legalization since 2011 so

370
00:15:24,499 --> 00:15:29,629
we've been very invested in this fight

371
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:33,500
we do currently represent cannabis

372
00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:34,789
workers and I think I imagined a lot of

373
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,708
people want to know about the LPA

374
00:15:34,789 --> 00:15:41,240
requirement is that what you were about

375
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:44,028
to ask as you probably all know you have

376
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,720
to have a signed labor peace agreement

377
00:15:44,028 --> 00:15:48,879
with a bonafide

378
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:52,519
labor union in order to get your your

379
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:54,860
annual license what that means is you

380
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:59,839
have to sign an agreement preferably

381
00:15:54,860 --> 00:16:03,370
with us to UFCW that says that in the

382
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:05,899
event that we organize your facility you

383
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:08,568
have to remain neutral

384
00:16:05,899 --> 00:16:10,549
you can't talk bad about the union you

385
00:16:08,568 --> 00:16:12,948
can't you know managers can't try to

386
00:16:10,549 --> 00:16:15,328
influence both in exchange we want

387
00:16:12,948 --> 00:16:18,269
strike we want boycott we want in

388
00:16:15,328 --> 00:16:20,248
your business this is a requirement for

389
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:23,039
anyone in the city of Los Angeles to

390
00:16:20,249 --> 00:16:25,739
have 10 or more employees and in the

391
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:27,988
state of California it's 20 or more and

392
00:16:25,739 --> 00:16:32,399
San Francisco is also 10 or more I doubt

393
00:16:27,989 --> 00:16:33,959
anyone's here from there though oh okay

394
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:38,850
well there you go

395
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:40,558
so so this signing this labor peace

396
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:43,379
agreement does not say that we're gonna

397
00:16:40,558 --> 00:16:46,428
come into your facility the next week or

398
00:16:43,379 --> 00:16:50,009
the next day to organize your workers

399
00:16:46,428 --> 00:16:52,889
it's safe you know this is an agreement

400
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:55,259
that lasts three years of the week and

401
00:16:52,889 --> 00:16:57,600
so you know we we have a team of about

402
00:16:55,259 --> 00:17:00,239
six that's not enough to go in and

403
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:03,808
organize every every dispensary or

404
00:17:00,239 --> 00:17:06,870
manufacturer even this year really you

405
00:17:03,808 --> 00:17:09,259
know our goal is to have a strong Union

406
00:17:06,869 --> 00:17:12,989
workforce in cannabis from seed to

407
00:17:09,259 --> 00:17:15,778
retail location to set you know good

408
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:17,609
wages to set the standard you know to

409
00:17:15,778 --> 00:17:19,318
make sure that the people that are doing

410
00:17:17,609 --> 00:17:22,438
the work in this industry are taken

411
00:17:19,318 --> 00:17:24,990
cared for are you know that no one's

412
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:26,639
violating labor law which you know

413
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:28,199
there's hopefully there's other people

414
00:17:26,638 --> 00:17:30,979
that are involved that are trying to

415
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:33,330
make sure that doesn't happen and

416
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:35,220
essentially just to make sure that the

417
00:17:33,329 --> 00:17:38,369
workers who in a lot of ways have been

418
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:43,200
with this industry for years you know

419
00:17:38,369 --> 00:17:44,969
continue to grow in it and continue to

420
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,190
it's a it's an industry where you can

421
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:50,000
raise a family you can have a dependable

422
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:52,889
paycheck that you can you know get paid

423
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,480
by a payroll company that if you do get

424
00:17:52,888 --> 00:17:56,609
laid off you can collect unemployment

425
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:59,220
just you know things like that to make

426
00:17:56,609 --> 00:18:04,079
sure that there is a standard in the

427
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:05,639
industry so that's that's kind of the

428
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:06,960
basis for it I think a lot of you are

429
00:18:05,638 --> 00:18:11,219
probably I don't know if anyone's

430
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:12,960
applying in phase two in LA but that

431
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:15,329
would be you would have to you know

432
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:18,019
either sign that labor peace agreement

433
00:18:15,329 --> 00:18:20,460
before submitting your application or

434
00:18:18,019 --> 00:18:22,798
essentially make a promise to sign one

435
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:23,610
if you know your business isn't up and

436
00:18:22,798 --> 00:18:26,819
running yet

437
00:18:23,609 --> 00:18:32,699
I just want to maybe have deemed touch

438
00:18:26,819 --> 00:18:36,210
on the ability now to get a bank account

439
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:39,210
to to pay your taxes to pay your

440
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:40,769
employees through a payroll company and

441
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:43,980
you said that there's been a lot of

442
00:18:40,769 --> 00:18:45,569
strides and making it more accessible to

443
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:50,179
the cannabis industry can you talk about

444
00:18:45,569 --> 00:18:50,178
that a little please I'm sorry

445
00:19:06,159 --> 00:19:14,720
you can make yeah you want to sign a

446
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:17,210
labor peace agreement with a union we

447
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,230
you know then fighting for legal is date

448
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:21,440
we're the only union that's been

449
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:23,960
fighting for legalization it makes the

450
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:27,320
most sense we already represent workers

451
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:30,558
you know we have no union is dedicated a

452
00:19:27,319 --> 00:19:32,089
team to cannabis like us we think it

453
00:19:30,558 --> 00:19:34,940
makes the most sense not just you know

454
00:19:32,089 --> 00:19:38,240
for us but for our you for the workers I

455
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:43,278
mean so but yes you could choose any

456
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:46,220
union you want it's about a six page

457
00:19:43,278 --> 00:19:48,919
agreement that states you know it lists

458
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:52,009
out particulars if we send a letter of

459
00:19:48,919 --> 00:19:53,629
intent to organize for example you would

460
00:19:52,009 --> 00:19:58,490
have to send us an employee list within

461
00:19:53,628 --> 00:20:02,418
10 days it states that you know if we if

462
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:05,269
we if basically it outlines what happens

463
00:20:02,419 --> 00:20:07,788
if we if we submit an intent to organize

464
00:20:05,269 --> 00:20:11,149
so it just lays out that process it lays

465
00:20:07,788 --> 00:20:13,038
out you know within how many days we you

466
00:20:11,148 --> 00:20:14,658
you know both the company and the union

467
00:20:13,038 --> 00:20:19,329
has to provide each other with certain

468
00:20:14,659 --> 00:20:22,549
information it just it's really and

469
00:20:19,329 --> 00:20:24,859
normally we don't have to actually even

470
00:20:22,548 --> 00:20:28,819
refer to the labor peace agreement we

471
00:20:24,859 --> 00:20:30,740
have good relationships with cannabis

472
00:20:28,819 --> 00:20:32,898
business owners we've been working

473
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:35,149
alongside each other so this is really

474
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:39,048
in the case that things you know get

475
00:20:35,148 --> 00:20:40,729
really ugly but it's really just kind of

476
00:20:39,048 --> 00:20:43,730
a lot of common sense things that we

477
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:45,558
would get you know an hour of time to

478
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:47,690
talk to the employees about the union at

479
00:20:45,558 --> 00:20:49,009
some point so just you know some

480
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:52,200
particulars like that and I'm happy to

481
00:20:49,009 --> 00:20:54,480
forward an example of the labor peace

482
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:56,610
to anyone to any business owners who are

483
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,950
interested come talk to me at the break

484
00:20:56,609 --> 00:21:01,379
and I'm happy to share information and

485
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:03,690
share the share the agreement just to

486
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:07,169
piggyback off that so if you're a member

487
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:11,130
of CCI a we can reach out to the CCI a

488
00:21:07,169 --> 00:21:13,710
HR committee and there's a model

489
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:15,630
agreement that CCA's or has sort of

490
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:18,028
blessed and we can talk with you about

491
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:19,049
that there are certain just answer your

492
00:21:18,028 --> 00:21:21,630
question there are certain things that

493
00:21:19,048 --> 00:21:22,798
the law says have to be considered and a

494
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:24,630
number of other things that are sort of

495
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:29,339
open to negotiation between the Union

496
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:32,039
and cannabis business so but yeah there

497
00:21:29,339 --> 00:21:34,558
are some forms floating around it so the

498
00:21:32,038 --> 00:21:36,750
question is whether our goal is to is to

499
00:21:34,558 --> 00:21:39,329
organize all the workers in the industry

500
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:42,028
or just essentially workers who need it

501
00:21:39,329 --> 00:21:43,980
the most who have been victim of labor

502
00:21:42,028 --> 00:21:46,619
law violations we would like to organize

503
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:48,360
the whole industry we want to set the

504
00:21:46,619 --> 00:21:50,969
standards we want to make sure that

505
00:21:48,359 --> 00:21:52,349
every workers you know getting paid more

506
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:54,149
than minimum wage getting paid overtime

507
00:21:52,349 --> 00:21:56,699
you know doesn't have to deal with

508
00:21:54,148 --> 00:21:58,408
sexual harassment you know eventually

509
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:59,940
you know you have to sign the labor

510
00:21:58,409 --> 00:22:01,740
piece if you have ten or more but if you

511
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:04,110
have fewer workers that doesn't mean

512
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:06,230
that you're you were never gonna try to

513
00:22:04,109 --> 00:22:10,648
organize your shop it just means that

514
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:13,048
process won't be we won't have you know

515
00:22:10,648 --> 00:22:16,739
we won't be bound by the process of the

516
00:22:13,048 --> 00:22:18,750
LPA but you know it's our I mean that's

517
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:20,099
you know labor unions as a goal that's

518
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:22,079
you know that's what they they're

519
00:22:20,099 --> 00:22:23,969
looking to organize an industry to make

520
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:26,009
sure that there aren't certain bad

521
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:28,230
actors who get away with taking

522
00:22:26,009 --> 00:22:29,908
advantage of their workers and you know

523
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:33,360
it's really to set a floor for for

524
00:22:29,909 --> 00:22:35,789
everyone and again just to sort of echo

525
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:36,990
that I I think if you are sitting in the

526
00:22:35,788 --> 00:22:38,579
room and you're worried about being

527
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:41,730
unionized or you're not sure about it

528
00:22:38,579 --> 00:22:43,349
the easiest way to get unionized is to

529
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:46,740
not pay your employees the right way

530
00:22:43,349 --> 00:22:48,449
have dangerous working conditions don't

531
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:51,240
carry workers comp have somebody get

532
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:52,740
injured at work it's very easy for a

533
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:54,058
union to come in and address all the

534
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:55,888
things that you just laid out to say

535
00:22:54,058 --> 00:22:57,599
they're not taking care of it so we'll

536
00:22:55,888 --> 00:23:00,599
take care of it for you

537
00:22:57,599 --> 00:23:03,059
as an employee group so there is a

538
00:23:00,599 --> 00:23:04,859
there's definitely a balance real

539
00:23:03,059 --> 00:23:09,569
quickly if you could just touch on the

540
00:23:04,859 --> 00:23:11,579
banking and peril in taxes yeah so one

541
00:23:09,569 --> 00:23:13,289
of the things that the federal

542
00:23:11,579 --> 00:23:15,269
government has kept in place

543
00:23:13,289 --> 00:23:18,649
notwithstanding the revocation of the

544
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:23,039
Cole memo is the Department of Treasury

545
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:25,410
is still requiring banks who bank

546
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:28,500
cannabis money to file marijuana and

547
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:29,970
Limited suspicious activity reports and

548
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:31,759
they're actually encouraging banks to

549
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:34,829
bank it so that there is some certainty

550
00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:38,490
and people aren't sort of hiding loads

551
00:23:34,829 --> 00:23:41,369
of cash under mattresses if you look

552
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:44,910
that the fencing department that is

553
00:23:41,369 --> 00:23:47,279
involved in receiving and outlining what

554
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:49,710
those reports look like publishes

555
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:51,180
statistics on how many banking

556
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:53,279
institutions are actually filing

557
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:55,920
marijuana suspicious activity reports

558
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:57,889
and contrary to the news that you're

559
00:23:55,920 --> 00:24:01,019
hearing that nobody's banking marijuana

560
00:23:57,890 --> 00:24:04,050
hundreds of banks are filing suspicious

561
00:24:01,019 --> 00:24:06,779
activity reports right now so the

562
00:24:04,049 --> 00:24:10,680
banking has happening and even if you

563
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:12,240
can't go into your current bank there

564
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:15,330
are probably other banks that if you're

565
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:17,039
out in the open about it and you tell

566
00:24:15,329 --> 00:24:19,199
them what you're doing will bank it I

567
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:20,819
know for example with the unions if

568
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,950
that's a solution and a partnership that

569
00:24:20,819 --> 00:24:24,839
you want to make some of the unions will

570
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:27,450
allow you to use the unions banking

571
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:29,009
facilities to do the payroll for their

572
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:30,200
unionized employees so there's a lot of

573
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:34,140
solutions that are out there

574
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:36,150
my without endorsing any single one of

575
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:38,370
them my message to everyone in this room

576
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:40,410
is just go find one

577
00:24:38,369 --> 00:24:42,659
so that you understand if you're not

578
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:45,150
paying you can pay people cash by the

579
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:47,370
way and still give them a pay stub it's

580
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:49,019
complicated as hell it's a pain in the

581
00:24:47,369 --> 00:24:50,428
ass and you'll probably go through an HR

582
00:24:49,019 --> 00:24:51,808
director every three weeks because

583
00:24:50,429 --> 00:24:54,600
they're having to do payroll on killing

584
00:24:51,808 --> 00:24:57,298
them so right okay she's she's for

585
00:24:54,599 --> 00:24:58,829
hire she's right but you can still do

586
00:24:57,298 --> 00:25:02,789
that at least give them a pay stub but

587
00:24:58,829 --> 00:25:04,019
if you set up a pay roll relationship it

588
00:25:02,789 --> 00:25:07,319
will give you the ability to track

589
00:25:04,019 --> 00:25:10,319
people's hours and then pay people based

590
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:13,048
on the hours that they actually work and

591
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:15,480
if they work over eight a day or work

592
00:25:13,048 --> 00:25:16,529
over 40 in a week your payroll system

593
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:18,298
will be set up in a way that it'll

594
00:25:16,529 --> 00:25:21,509
automatically calculate the overtime

595
00:25:18,298 --> 00:25:23,759
hours and all of the deductions and

596
00:25:21,509 --> 00:25:26,519
state payroll taxes will be set up and

597
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:28,769
we'll go through that bosses all of that

598
00:25:26,519 --> 00:25:30,569
is going to give you documentation of

599
00:25:28,769 --> 00:25:32,220
what you're doing you'll be able to show

600
00:25:30,569 --> 00:25:34,798
that you're paying your employees the

601
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:36,900
right way and so if people leave and

602
00:25:34,798 --> 00:25:39,539
they're jaded or they're there they're

603
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:41,669
upset with you and they go to see a

604
00:25:39,539 --> 00:25:44,009
labor attorney or they go downtown to

605
00:25:41,669 --> 00:25:46,530
Los Angeles and they file a claim with

606
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:48,179
the DL SC and they go in and talk to an

607
00:25:46,529 --> 00:25:49,259
agent and the agents first question is

608
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:51,600
going to be let me see your payroll

609
00:25:49,259 --> 00:25:53,039
records and if you're doing some of

610
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:54,839
these basic things this is not

611
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:57,178
complicated stuff if you're doing some

612
00:25:54,839 --> 00:25:58,949
of those basic things the DL se is not

613
00:25:57,179 --> 00:26:00,929
going to take that claim that that

614
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:02,400
plaintiff lawyer down the street is

615
00:26:00,929 --> 00:26:05,190
going to tell them it looks like they're

616
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:06,780
doing things right but if they walk into

617
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:08,880
the DL se or they walk into a lawyer's

618
00:26:06,779 --> 00:26:10,769
office and they say well they pay me in

619
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,900
cash and I don't get a pay stub and they

620
00:26:10,769 --> 00:26:15,179
don't record the hours that I work that

621
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:17,548
lawyers once you start drooling and

622
00:26:15,179 --> 00:26:20,669
you're going to see a multi plaintiff

623
00:26:17,548 --> 00:26:23,009
case land on your doorstep and they're

624
00:26:20,669 --> 00:26:25,110
gonna say pay up or we're gonna take you

625
00:26:23,009 --> 00:26:26,069
to court and put you to put this out

626
00:26:25,109 --> 00:26:28,079
into the public

627
00:26:26,069 --> 00:26:30,240
maybe expose your business that maybe is

628
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:33,418
not fully licensed yet the government

629
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:34,919
scrutiny I'm a lawyer but I can I guess

630
00:26:33,419 --> 00:26:36,000
that means I can tell a bad lawyer jokes

631
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:38,340
lawyers are not very nice people

632
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:41,220
sometimes and this is not by the way

633
00:26:38,339 --> 00:26:42,509
always for the benefit of your employees

634
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:44,069
it's for those lawyers to get lawyers

635
00:26:42,509 --> 00:26:45,660
fees out of it right they're trying to

636
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:48,659
collect money

637
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:51,240
you're paying so if you give them a

638
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:52,680
low-hanging fruit piece of a piece of

639
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:55,170
fruit case where they can just go this

640
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:56,340
is a slam-dunk winner they're going to

641
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:59,039
take you and they're gonna extort

642
00:26:56,339 --> 00:27:01,079
they're going to maximum settlement

643
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:03,359
ality so those are the sort of things

644
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:05,639
that a banking relationship a payroll

645
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:09,500
relationship just naturally will blossom

646
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:12,150
those those sort of compliance issues

647
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:15,569
another thing to take that just a little

648
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:17,790
bit further is forget about the lawsuit

649
00:27:15,569 --> 00:27:20,399
that the employee is going to put on you

650
00:27:17,789 --> 00:27:23,609
but the state of California payroll tax

651
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:25,920
is going to come after you and the state

652
00:27:23,609 --> 00:27:28,409
of California when you are not paying

653
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:30,330
payroll taxes on your employee they look

654
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:32,670
at that as you're stealing money not

655
00:27:30,329 --> 00:27:35,039
just from the state of California but

656
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:37,080
also the employee and they're far more

657
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:39,629
ruthless than the IRS in the state of

658
00:27:37,079 --> 00:27:41,549
California if you owe them money from

659
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:44,340
the federal government of the state so

660
00:27:41,549 --> 00:27:46,259
not paying your employees appropriately

661
00:27:44,339 --> 00:27:48,839
not just gets you in trouble with a

662
00:27:46,259 --> 00:27:50,490
lawsuit from your employee but the state

663
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:51,990
of California is going to definitely

664
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:54,660
come after you for that

665
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:57,359
I've spoken with several of them some of

666
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:59,279
the some of the the EDD officers and

667
00:27:57,359 --> 00:28:02,009
they sit in the they used to sit in the

668
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:04,170
parking lots of dispensaries and count

669
00:28:02,009 --> 00:28:06,210
how many people walk in go in as a

670
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:08,190
patient count how many employees there

671
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:10,170
are go back to their office look up the

672
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:13,470
address and see how much payroll tax has

673
00:28:10,170 --> 00:28:15,930
been paid and file right then so this is

674
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:19,259
a this is not a joke this is something

675
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:22,200
that's very serious and I know all about

676
00:28:19,259 --> 00:28:24,680
that stuff so please you know take this

677
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,680
stuff very seriously

678
00:28:25,299 --> 00:28:31,899
again piggyback off of that I've sat in

679
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:35,279
so many conference rooms across the

680
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:38,890
attorneys like him and he's going to ask

681
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:40,359
for every document every the first thing

682
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:42,580
he's going to ask for is your handbook

683
00:28:40,359 --> 00:28:45,250
the next thing he's going to ask you for

684
00:28:42,579 --> 00:28:46,659
is your payroll records so you know even

685
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:49,660
though it's a pain in the butt

686
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:51,820
and again it's not fun it's something

687
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:54,519
that you really as an employer need to

688
00:28:51,819 --> 00:28:56,799
have I've talked to several of the very

689
00:28:54,519 --> 00:28:58,059
large payroll companies out there and

690
00:28:56,799 --> 00:29:02,279
asked them if they would take on

691
00:28:58,059 --> 00:29:05,139
cannabis clients and they say yeah

692
00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:06,940
they're not really excited about it yet

693
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:08,380
they say they can take on a cannabis

694
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:10,299
company as long as they don't have a

695
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:11,830
conspicuous name so it has to be

696
00:29:10,299 --> 00:29:15,789
something that has nothing to do with

697
00:29:11,829 --> 00:29:17,980
cannabis itself which I don't know how

698
00:29:15,789 --> 00:29:20,230
they determine that but I know that

699
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:21,819
there is one company and if you ever

700
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:25,660
want to get in touch with me that that

701
00:29:21,819 --> 00:29:27,970
does handle cannabis industry but it

702
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:32,769
really is better

703
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:35,289
to to to just get this taken care of get

704
00:29:32,769 --> 00:29:38,230
somebody in who knows how to do it knows

705
00:29:35,289 --> 00:29:39,970
how to handle it and just get it taken

706
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:42,460
care of I promise you in the long run

707
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:45,039
when you do get sued because these

708
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:46,870
employees have just as much access to

709
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:49,720
the law

710
00:29:46,869 --> 00:29:51,819
and they research and if you make them

711
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:55,230
mad they're going to start coming at you

712
00:29:51,819 --> 00:29:55,230
so you want to protect yourself

713
00:29:59,579 --> 00:30:01,639
you

714
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:10,950
