00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,640

00:00:42,878 --> 00:00:46,558
that we've done out of all of them

events you know it's a secret you really

6
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,359
can't

7
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,679
can't tell people too much about it you

8
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:55,439
know just can't say none

9
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:57,439
this has been a dream of mine to be able

10
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:59,198
to do these events it's super super

11
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:00,799
great to be able to

12
00:00:59,198 --> 00:01:03,039
dream up something like this and then

13
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:05,118
sit back and and see it

14
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:07,680

it was taking some scary ass risks it

19
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,560
really was but the reward was great

20
00:01:19,118 --> 00:01:22,400
because it felt like we carved out a

21
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,719
little piece of the world and made it

22
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,840
exactly how we wanted to

23
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:27,840

contest that puts the voting power in

most people already know that cannabis

53
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:44,560
grows from a seed but the part of the

54
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:47,039
plant we use for medicine comes

55
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,120
primarily from the oil in the trichomes

56
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:52,400
which are formed on the outside of the

57
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:54,800
flowers and leaves hashish is simply oil

58
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,360
extracted from the flowers and leaves

59
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,599
trichomes can be separated many ways the

60
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,760
oldest is to use a sifting technique to

61
00:02:59,598 --> 00:03:04,158
separate the resin heads and make what

62
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:06,560
is commonly called keith one of the most

63
00:03:04,158 --> 00:03:09,120
popular extraction techniques is to use

64
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,920
low heat and pressure to simply squish

65
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:15,360
the oil out of the buds keep or water

66
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:15,359
hash and make rosin

67
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:22,719
water hash is made using a system of

68
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:24,878
bags filled with ice water and cannabis

69
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:26,878
the contents are carefully stirred to

70
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:28,560
separate out the plant material from the

71
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:31,280
trichomes

72
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:34,640
once properly dried and cured water hash

73
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:36,479
results in a quality product

74
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:38,719
hash oils have become one of the most

connoisseurs

77
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,400
usually made with common solvents and

78
00:03:42,158 --> 00:03:45,359
involves a closed-looped extraction

79
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,480
process

80
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,319
often called oil shatter wax or butter

81
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:53,518
these products have proven both the

82
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:55,438
safety and effectivity of cannabis as a

83

universal medicine

84
00:03:55,438 --> 00:04:00,318
while the recipe is simple the results

85
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:02,798
are amazing

86
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:05,679
the secret cup is the only competition

87
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:07,840
where the extract makers are the judges

88
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,920
coming together as a community and

89
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,319
sharing techniques with their peers to

90
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:14,318
advance their craft before ultimately

91
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:17,199
deciding whose entry is the

92
00:04:14,318 --> 00:04:19,599
international champion i guess for me

93
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:22,240
the secret cup is many things

94
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,800
it has become a way that i get to

95
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:27,960
celebrate with my friends and so we have

96
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,960
a family

97
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,199
yeah so i started making hash um

98
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,560
i'm actually a grower been in the

99
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:38,280
industry for

100
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,280
since solidly 1998.

[Music]

102
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,840
i get like a lime taste

103
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:54,559
it's good but it's just kind of low in

104
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:57,519
taste i got this inspiration by coming

105
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,918
to the cup to the secret cup in 2012 and

106
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:02,079
i took last place man and it

107
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:03,599
it uh burned inside of me like no other

108
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:05,279
and i met i was around a bunch of guys

109
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,639
that were from my area

110
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:08,719
that were probably like the best

111
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,478
hashmakers on the planet you know like

112
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,240
and it just was super inspiring being

113
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:13,599
around them and um haven't really looked

114
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,600
back

115
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,080
i have been making hash since i was a

116
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,080
kid we would grow outdoor and because of

117
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:21,918
the climate uh and where we were at we

118
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:24,159
weren't getting very dense nugs and so

119
00:05:21,918 --> 00:05:25,680
what we would end up doing is hashing it

120
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,600
because that was the way we could make

121
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,439
any money off of what we grew

122
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,360
so that's how it kind of started and

123
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:34,399
then it just progressed from there i

124
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,520
ended up preferring hash to uh to

125
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:37,758
flowers

126
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:40,159
just because it really lets me know

127
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,840
where the terpene profile stands and and

128
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,360
where the grower was at when he when he

129
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:44,560
made his when he made his product you

130
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,400
know it lets me know everything about

131
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,478
the grower you know just from the taste

132
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:50,959
flavor and so you know that's that's why

133
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:53,199
i prefer hash that and and it's a health

134
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:54,959
thing you know less is more you know

135
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,800
when it comes to hash and you don't end

136
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:58,560
up smoking flowers all day long every

137
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,079
day stinking and wasting your time you

138
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,800
know take a dab and it's done my

139
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:05,439
favorite thing about the secret cup is

140
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,879
the friends and the people that have

141
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:08,959
and they're all from different areas in

142
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:10,879
the country but we can all keep in touch

143
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:13,918
on the internet or whatever and

144
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:14,879
we all share an unhealthy obsession with

145
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:17,120
dabbing

146
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:19,439
the culture that surrounds it this is a

147
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:22,079
real organic

148
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:24,160
community experience this is done with a

149
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:25,839
lot of effort a lot of love there's

150
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,560
something here that you won't find in

151
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:30,478
the corporate element of other events it

152
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,000
doesn't really have that feel of people

153
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:34,478
trying to make money it more or less has

154
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,560
the feel of a community trying to

155
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:38,639
really become more tight-knit

156
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,038
and

00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,038
attending a lot of their events events

171
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,879
like this progress the movement because

172
00:07:21,038 --> 00:07:25,038
really nobody else is doing anything

173
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:27,038
like this we strive for

174
00:07:25,038 --> 00:07:30,560
perfection in our work but at the secret

175
00:07:27,038 --> 00:07:32,000
cups there's a little bit more of a i

176
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,918
don't know like a brotherhood where we

177
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,038
can talk about things and share our tech

178
00:07:33,918 --> 00:07:39,198
rather than try to um hoard it or keep

179
00:07:37,038 --> 00:07:41,038
it as like a secret society or something

180
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:44,160
that

181
00:07:41,038 --> 00:07:45,598
to me the the secret cup is my family

182
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:49,280
not just my friends

183
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:51,279
um wherever we are if you

184
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:52,399
catch the vision and you're a part of it

185
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:54,000
then

186
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:55,839
you're part of the family

187
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,439

188
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:59,679

[Music]

206
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,240
we get to celebrate the things that we

207
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,680
love the culture of cannabis

208
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,479
concentrates

209
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,958
and

210
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:46,000
all the good things that we want to see

211
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:48,079
go further in the community it was like

212
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,039
summer camp for hashmakers

213
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,639
it was like the the best symposium we

214
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:54,799
could come up with

215
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:56,000
it's cool that the event kind of grew

216
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:58,000
with

217
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,320
the movement you know and it grew at the

218
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,799
times it's really developed into its own

219
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:05,519
beast um i go to all types of wheat

220
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:07,838

223
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:14,159
i've been attending almost every secret

224
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:16,480
cup since the inception and i've also

225
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:19,199
performed at several of them or hosted

226
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:21,519

00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,680
capacity another for a lot of the shows

228
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:26,399
but i can't take credit for any of it

229
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:28,159
it's all definitely jeremy and daniel's

230
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,159
i'm really really happy that we were

231

00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,759
experiencing superior work

242
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:55,439
so it's for the kind of sewers and it's

243
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,159
for the patients

244
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,800

248

253
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:16,479
the best bringing everybody together

254
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:17,599
you know it's somebody's cool house and

255
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,879
we're hanging out and you're just

256
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,440
chilling like you're with your friends

257
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:23,278
at home you know i like being able to

258
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,720
meet people on a one-on-one basis

259
00:10:23,278 --> 00:10:26,639
sometimes when you meet someone in their

260
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,639
booth they're so riddled with other

261
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:30,879
people and stress and everything that

262
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:32,480
they got going on it's hard to get on a

263
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:33,838
personal basis with someone and really

264
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,159
talk to them about their tech or what

265
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,839
they're doing or or how where they stand

266
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:39,679
in the oil industry or even in the

267
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,200
cannabis industry period when it's a

268
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:42,879
much more personal level like this and

269
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,240
you have a lot more time to hang out

270
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:46,159
with everyone and hear where they come

271
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,600
from and hear their story you meet a lot

272
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:49,120
of great people from all around the

273
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,680
world that you never would have had the

274
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,759
chance to meet and you know that's

275
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:54,719
that's probably one of the better things

276
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:57,200
about

277
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:00,079
the nationals is that here in vegas you

278
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,680
know you have the top three from every

279
00:11:00,078 --> 00:11:04,319
region around the world essentially the

280
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:06,239
20 best hash makers in the united states

281
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,600
and you know to have them all sit down

282
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,519
at the same table and compare each

283
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,278
other's stuff in and of itself is is

284
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,720
just making history in the cannabis

285
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:16,000
movement fuck yeah i think we're the

286
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,600
best you know maybe not me but the group

287
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,958
of people are probably hands down the

288
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,959
best you know

289
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:23,759
i'm a very lucky person i get to travel

290
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:25,599
all over the country and now the world

291
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:27,838
doing these competitions bringing

292
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,680
like-minded people together it's such a

293
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:31,040
joy to be able to experience all these

294
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:32,000
different places and all these different

295
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:33,919
people

296
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,559
we don't make a lot of money

297
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:38,958
but the the experiences we get in being

298
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:40,799
able to go to the event ourselves that

299
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:43,518
we want to go to even though we had to

300
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:45,199
create it uh it's priceless

301
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:46,560
it's the thing i'm most proud of

302
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,000
in life

303
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:51,759
i don't want to thank haggard for just

304
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,759
djing for like two days straight

305
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:56,240
[Applause]

306
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,600
i think jeremy has a few things too we

307
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,919
wanted to throw out there before we

308
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,839
start announcing the winners myself and

309
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:04,719
daniel met at a

310
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:06,959
dispensary it was called kind meds

311
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:09,278
they were the premier

312
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:11,759
dispensary for concentrates in the

313
00:12:09,278 --> 00:12:13,679
valley at the time when i was growing up

314
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:16,720
the there was a definite stigma against

315
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:18,399
cannabis my mother she was a smoker and

316
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:21,120
was actually smoking until she was about

317
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:23,679
five months pregnant but my grandmother

318
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,839
was definitely against it even though

319
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:28,000
she owned a bar when i moved from

320
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:29,680
arizona to california to live with her

321
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,078
she broke it down for me to like see

322
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:34,479
that bench right there in blythe me and

323
00:12:32,078 --> 00:12:36,319
your stepdad smoked a joint there and at

324
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,480
first it was completely shocking to me

325
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:41,040
the fact that she my mother smoked pot

326
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:43,120
you know but for the next five years i

327
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:46,240
was living with her and you know got

328
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:49,278
very exposed to it and

329
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:51,039
yeah i never really

330
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:52,879
had a stigma after i was nine years old

331
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:53,679
i mean it was just a part of regular

332
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:55,360
life

333
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:57,599
so there were no brand names or

334
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,519
companies known for cannabis there were

335
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,839
strains that you'd heard about like maui

336
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,600
wowie was this famous hawaiian strain or

337
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:05,920
thai stick when you're going to buy

338
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,159
cannabis in the old days it was like

339
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:09,919
good bud or bad

340
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:12,399
cheap or expensive

341
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:14,159
there were not a lot of choices and it

342
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:16,078
wasn't the same every time you went back

343
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:17,838
to the same person even

344
00:13:16,078 --> 00:13:19,199
sometimes they would have this sometimes

345
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,959
they would have that

346
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,040
you got a little bit of variety but they

347
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:24,958
were limited in what they grew or who

348
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:27,679
they were able to get from too

349
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:29,599
so we didn't have any of the brands here

350
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:31,679
in the united states when you went

351
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,000
overseas though they had seed companies

352
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:35,838
and coffee shops so certain genetics

353
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,078
started to come from people who had

354
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:40,880
established themselves in amsterdam and

355
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:43,198
other places at sea companies

356
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:45,198
and the strains they came out with

357
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:48,240
would generate recognition and those

358
00:13:45,198 --> 00:13:49,838
would become sought after as well but

359
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,919
even then from grower to grower the

360
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:54,000
plants can be very different

361
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:56,078
even though it's the same genetics and

362
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,919
even from seed to seed of the same

363
00:13:56,078 --> 00:13:59,519
strain they can be very different your

364
00:13:57,919 --> 00:14:01,759
experience with cannabis was very

365
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,600
limited and very unique

366
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:05,919
if you were even able to get some of

367
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:08,159
this stuff so as cannabis grew and

368
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:10,479
became more of a mainstream thing

369
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:12,639
now you saw it was easier to establish

370
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,480
and popularize a brand

371
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:17,278
then the change went away from the

372
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:19,278
emphasis being really the genetics and

373
00:14:17,278 --> 00:14:21,120
now it's more the brands with certain

374
00:14:19,278 --> 00:14:23,838
genetics being associated with those

375
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:26,720
brands it's really fascinating

376
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:28,480
it was all uh in college for me

377
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,320
see when i was 16 years old i was living

378
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,240
in a foster home i joined a christian

379
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,079
fundamentalist church

380
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,360
and was in there until i was 19 years

381
00:14:34,078 --> 00:14:38,078
old

382
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:41,360
and then uh when i was 19 years old

383
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:42,958
i decided that you know i met a girl and

384
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,800
i decided i wanted to be with her not

385
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:47,518
with the church so

386
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:50,078
i uh i left it there was this weird kid

387
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:53,120
who was an obvious stoner um

388
00:14:50,078 --> 00:14:55,120
i was about to cross the street and he

389
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,399
was crossing the street too and he was

390
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,320
and we ran into each other he was like

391
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:00,078
hey can you try to buy us some beer at

392
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,160
the store we're both 19. and i'm like

393
00:15:00,078 --> 00:15:04,719
sure i'll give it a shot i walk right in

394
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:06,958
there i get his 240s and come out and

395
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:09,120
he's like hey i i want to roll up this

396
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:11,039
blunt you know do you want to smoke and

397
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,600
i'm like yeah so we go back to his

398
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:16,240
apartment um he got one of those giant

399
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:18,320
cigars and announced a swag and he broke

400
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,799
it all up pulled the seeds and stems out

401
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:23,040
and rolled the fattest blunt i smoked

402
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:24,958
half of it slept on his couch like for

403
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:26,958
two days and i just woke up and i think

404
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:29,278
i've smoked every weed every single day

405
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:29,278
since

406
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,159
look at that guy go lugs of steels

407
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,680
after his philosopher's stones and

408
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:46,559
everything

409
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:48,399
cannabis helped me socially tremendously

410
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:51,439
i wasn't one of the popular kids growing

411
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:53,360
up and all i ever wanted was to just be

412
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:56,240
one of the cool kids for the longest

413
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:58,480
time i did not embrace being different

414
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,959
i saw it as a negative thing growing up

415
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,720
not being part of the in crowd knowing

416
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:05,119
that i was different from everybody else

417
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,879
it was a struggle as i smoked cannabis i

418
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,560
started to realize that being different

419
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:11,278
could be something really cool and

420
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:11,278
really special

421
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,600
and i was able to have this life that i

422
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:18,480
dreamed about growing up and travel all

423
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,480
over the world do all these crazy things

424
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,440
that was all because of cannabis i think

425
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,159
for me um it was the entire lifestyle of

426
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,120
it

427
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:27,278
i

428
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,519
sold weed because you know i was a

429
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:30,879
foster kid that went straight into a

430
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:33,278
university

431
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:35,198
and lived on financial aid

432
00:16:33,278 --> 00:16:36,958
and i wanted to smoke and have fun and

433
00:16:35,198 --> 00:16:39,359
you know live like the other college

434
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:41,758
kids so this afforded me the opportunity

435
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,440
to do it what i liked about it the most

436
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:45,199
is how it just brought so many different

437
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,120
people together

438
00:16:45,198 --> 00:16:49,439
like you know when you're 18 19 years

439
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,120
old you have these sessions where

440
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,959
you know you have black people white

441
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,720
people people from korea that are

442
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:57,119
exchange students people from europe

443
00:16:54,720 --> 00:17:00,000
that are exchange students you know

444
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,759
all together smoking weed and it was

445
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,880
really cool and it was really fun and it

446
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:07,199
was really nice and i felt like i was on

447
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:09,039
the path to some sort of

448
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:10,490
like some sort of thing something was

449
00:17:09,038 --> 00:17:13,568
coming

450
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:13,568
[Applause]

451
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,480
almost shattered kids it doesn't like to

452
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,759
stick to a fucking dabber

453
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,120
so if you get shattered in your eyes

454
00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:22,640
please do not sue me i don't have that

455
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:24,479
much money

456
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,559
the idea for the secret cup came from a

457
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,480
trip that i took to california right

458
00:17:26,558 --> 00:17:30,480
after i won

459
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,798
first place the denver high times

460
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,400
medical cannabis cup for concentrate it

461
00:17:32,798 --> 00:17:36,400
gave me a little bit of notoriety and i

462
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,160
was doing well financially so i took a

463
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,798
trip all up down the coast when i went

464
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:42,320
to san jose i was hanging out with a

465
00:17:40,798 --> 00:17:44,000
bunch of people that

466
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:45,918
were part of this group online called

467
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,279
extract artists you know we were talking

468
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:49,520
about cups and we wanted to make the

469
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:51,359
best event possible so one thing that we

470
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:53,279
decided was you know we really had to

471
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:54,959
have qualified people judging it and

472
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:57,279
then we decided that

473
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,079
the most qualified people of all would

474
00:17:57,279 --> 00:18:00,079
be

475
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:02,879
um actual

476
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:04,879
extract artist the first seeker cup

477
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,960
daniel was throwing it

478
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:09,840
when i went to cover the

479
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,759
event at his house i realized he was

480
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:13,038
overwhelmed and i started helping out

481
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:15,519
right away

482
00:18:13,038 --> 00:18:18,558
being the person that i am in the

483
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:21,440
industry i've been on a lot of different

484
00:18:18,558 --> 00:18:22,399
teams and i can recognize something

485
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,000
as

486
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,480
truly wonderful

487
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,319
and truly special when i see it

488
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,679
and i immediately recognized that the

489
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:31,759
seeker cup was going to be something

490
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:33,679
very special that the people who were

491
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:36,400
entering were different they weren't the

492
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:38,240
typical people that enter

493
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,640
a lot of these other events

494
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:43,120
the idea came sort of evolved into you

495
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,880
know the actual you know competitors

496
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:47,519
would be judging

497
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,880
the people they were competing against

498
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:51,119
because the fact is i wanted to make it

499
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,960
educational i want everyone who competes

500
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:54,239
to learn i want them to see what's

501
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,960
possible i want them to see what they're

502
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,400
competing against and uh you know if

503
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,880
they need to just change what they're

504
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:03,840
doing to be better the whole

505
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:06,640
sentiment of the competition was not the

506
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:08,959
same there was almost a level of sharing

507
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,480
and and camaraderie that was part of

508
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,919
this competition

509
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:15,839
versus like

510
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:18,960
a typical competition was very like

511
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:22,159
segregated and tribal you know

512
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:23,919
i'm versus you were enemies

513
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:26,160
but at the secret cup people were

514
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:28,640
sharing ideas they were talking about

515
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,519
these concepts in a different way

516
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,559
it was

517
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:34,400
kind of to raise the bar for everyone

518
00:19:32,558 --> 00:19:36,558
it's kind of my legacy it's kind of like

519
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,720
what i'm trying to do i won a lot of

520
00:19:36,558 --> 00:19:39,918
prizes and uh

521
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,558
contests

522
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:44,240
previously and i find that i like giving

523
00:19:42,558 --> 00:19:46,399
out the prizes even better than i liked

524
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:49,038
winning them just because

525
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,960
it's fun to be able to find new talent

526
00:19:49,038 --> 00:19:53,519
in something and

527
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:55,120
a lot of the hashmakers that are doing

528
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:56,079
really well today and making great

529
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:57,359
products

530
00:19:56,079 --> 00:19:59,759
um were

531
00:19:57,359 --> 00:20:01,119
not discovered by the secret cup but you

532
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:02,158
know that was the first contest they

533
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:04,319
ever won

534
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:05,520
when i saw that in colorado at the first

535
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:07,678
seeker cup

536
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:11,359
i told daniel i said i want to do this

537
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:14,080
in los angeles our community was

538
00:20:11,359 --> 00:20:16,079
potentially deeper and

539
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:18,240
doing better work than the work they

540
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:21,119
were doing in colorado and i wanted to

541
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:23,359
showcase that right away you know i had

542
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:25,759
been to the amsterdam cannabis cups many

543
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:28,079
times and a common sentiment when you're

544
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:29,599
going there from california

545
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:31,279
is that you're not very impressed with

546
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:33,519
the quality of cannabis or the quality

547
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:35,038
of hash or you know the quality of a lot

548
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:36,798
of the products that are being entered

549
00:20:35,038 --> 00:20:38,480
some of it is definitely very impressive

550
00:20:36,798 --> 00:20:40,158
if you're lucky enough to get

551
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:43,360
uh introduced to that

552
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:45,520
and so i i came to daniel and i said i

553
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:46,798
wanted to do it and then when he gave me

554
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:49,119
the green light

555
00:20:46,798 --> 00:20:52,000
to go ahead and do it i took that ball

556
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:52,000
and i ran with it

557
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:59,679
the big event in cannabis when i was

558
00:20:57,119 --> 00:21:01,759
growing up was high times cannabis cup

559
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:02,880
and they would do that every year in

560
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:04,319
amsterdam

561
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,240
there was a part of the whole business

562
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:08,000
side that was really odd to me as a

563
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,599
consumer at the time

564
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,159
when you're meeting these cannabis

565
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:13,839
celebrities and people you looked up to

566
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:16,240
there was all this beef that was going

567
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:18,798
on in the cannabis industry

568
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,480
adam from th seeds i heard refer to it

569
00:21:18,798 --> 00:21:22,960
as politics

570
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,240
seems so ridiculous from the outside

571
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,919
looking in

572
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,159
these people were openly working in

573
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:29,679
cannabis they were growing weed for a

574
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:31,520
living

575
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:33,360
isn't this the most wonderful dream job

576
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:35,359
that anybody could have

577
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:37,359
but somehow they all had these little

578
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:39,199
chips on their shoulders to a certain

579
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:41,119
degree and it was kind of this whole

580
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,640
shady side of the business

581
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:44,399
if you win a cannabis cup you get to be

582
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,159
a judge so i got to see behind the doors

583
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,280
and see that whole process

584
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:48,880
and the coolest part of the whole

585
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:51,519
experience was getting a whole bunch of

586
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:53,760
different weed of course

587
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:55,359
and being actually being chilling in

588
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:56,158
what was called the judge house at the

589
00:21:55,359 --> 00:21:57,199
time

590
00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:00,159
um

591
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,759
felt really exclusive you know uh

592
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:04,240
hanging out with like method man and red

593
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:05,519
men smoking weed with like famous people

594
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,200
was kind of cool

595
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:09,038
but you know it kind of occurred to me

596
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,558
like coming from the perspective of a

597
00:22:09,038 --> 00:22:11,839
competitor

598
00:22:10,558 --> 00:22:13,119
that these people were just not

599
00:22:11,839 --> 00:22:14,639
qualified

600
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:17,119
like it was

601
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,880
a few of us winners and then

602
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:21,199
like everybody else was just like

603
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:23,280
buddies and stuff that had known certain

604
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:25,759
staff members for a long time there's a

605
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:26,399
lot of events right now and

606
00:22:25,759 --> 00:22:29,919
they

607
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:31,840
are a new thing for a lot of people

608
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:34,159
the high times event is the one that's

609
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:36,079
been around for the longest time and

610
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:38,159
we're all just figuring it out as we go

611
00:22:36,079 --> 00:22:41,199
along and different people have

612
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:44,320
different core ideals involved with when

613
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:46,400
they're doing the shows you know

614
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:48,879
different people do it for furthering

615
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:51,200
their companies or for some vision that

616
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:53,440
they might have but i think we have a

617
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:55,759
really special place that we come from

618
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,919
where we're doing it because we've

619
00:22:55,759 --> 00:22:59,839
attended and done all the other shows

620
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:02,080
and we know what it is that we're

621
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:03,599
missing and we're trying to fill that

622
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:04,480
gap for people

623
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:07,038
and

624
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:09,519
show everyone how great it can really be

625
00:23:07,038 --> 00:23:11,759
like yeah like you have people like our

626
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:14,319
boy brett and maine uh he was the

627
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:16,158
coordinator over in maine and he started

628
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:18,960
doing his own event out there at the

629
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:21,039
same venue that he found this like cool

630
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,720
little farm area and they had like a big

631
00:23:21,038 --> 00:23:25,038
barn where you can throw stuff in and

632
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,400
like the owner smokes so it's cool

633
00:23:25,038 --> 00:23:28,640
yeah he started doing a community

634
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:30,559
bonfire like two or three times a year

635
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,880
and that's awesome you know

636
00:23:30,558 --> 00:23:34,639
i'm very happy to inspire something like

637
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,559
that and then you have the people that

638
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:39,280
we inspired that only saw

639
00:23:36,558 --> 00:23:40,960
the expo part of it thinking like

640
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:42,558
that was the thing

641
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,558
right when

642
00:23:42,558 --> 00:23:47,119
our events like were about like a week

643
00:23:44,558 --> 00:23:49,440
or two weeks leading up to

644
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:51,599
the the actual public expo the public

645
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:53,919
expo was the award show

646
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:55,759
that we also had booths at

647
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:57,679
but that wasn't the thing

648
00:23:55,759 --> 00:23:59,759
you know that was the end of the thing

649
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:02,960
but they saw they saw that and they were

650
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:05,679
like okay we give if we find a venue and

651
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:08,000
make a swap meet people will come

652
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:09,038
and that's good too you know that is

653
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,159
good too

654
00:24:09,038 --> 00:24:14,960
but this is like you know the

655
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:16,960
the lowest aspect of it all the the the

656
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,640
buying and the selling not the hanging

657
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,720
out not the community you might have a

658
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:22,799
dj or comedian making some jokes but

659
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:25,200
there's nowhere for you to sit you walk

660
00:24:22,798 --> 00:24:26,558
around in a circle you buy what you want

661
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,640
you go home

662
00:24:26,558 --> 00:24:30,399
and that's cool too that's cool too

663
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,679
actually it started when high time

664
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:35,278
started coming around i think it was

665
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:36,960
like 2010 2011 um high time started

666
00:24:35,278 --> 00:24:39,440
coming to the u.s

667
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:41,679
the medical scene in california and in

668
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,960
denver and washington had had progressed

669

i

681
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:10,960
started going to the competitions um and

682
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:12,639
i had friends that owned different

683
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:15,120
companies and i had helped them with

684
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:17,038
different entries and or entered my own

685
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:18,239
stuff and just kind of progressed from

686
00:25:17,038 --> 00:25:20,400
there i started to make a name for

687
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:22,240
myself when people started to see what i

688

707

have and it was that right there was my

712
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:07,759
motivation to continue with what i was

713
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,600
doing and to go even harder and try to

714
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:11,440

716
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:15,519
myself there's a lot of people that work

717
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:17,038
every day and they make a lot of money

718
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:18,480
but they might not feel too good about

719
00:26:17,038 --> 00:26:19,919
what they do for a living you know like

720
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,200

721
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:24,320
about what i do there's a lot of people

722
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:26,159

723
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:28,000
the people that love them is better

724
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:29,520

725
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,919
that right there is what makes me want

726
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:33,839
to help as many people as i can and try

727
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:35,679
to make sure that you know everyone

728
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:37,199
understands that you know a lot of

729
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:38,559
things have been purported a lot of way

730
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,880
you know there's a lot of pharmaceutical

731
00:26:38,558 --> 00:26:43,359
drugs that really increase problems

732
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:45,520
instead of alleviate them and cbd's is a

733
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:46,798
way for people to really

734
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:48,639
change

735
00:26:46,798 --> 00:26:49,918
what's wrong with them change issues

736
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,919
that they're having and alleviate

737
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:54,240

741
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:03,679
behind it we just now have everything we

742
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:05,679

people that lives are improved and the

746
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,960
more people that see that

747
00:27:11,119 --> 00:27:14,798
is the change that we can make in the

748
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,558
world you know we got to start with

749
00:27:14,798 --> 00:27:20,359
ourselves and hope that other people

750
00:27:16,558 --> 00:27:20,359
follow suit you know

751
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:27,439
definitely not my first secret cup uh i

752
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:29,519
heard about the secret cup a while ago

753
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:32,000
and then finally they came to the east

754
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:34,000
coast did the secret cup beast coast

755
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,759
when i entered in as dabber hashery

00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,440
extracts and

757
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:39,359
got to meet all the good boys at the cup

758
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:43,278
the competition element of it is sort of

759
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:43,278
like it's like an american idol

760
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:46,839
of hash making

761
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:57,119
and now

762
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:59,359
the award for highest terps

763
00:27:57,119 --> 00:28:00,319
surprisingly goes to a high cbd entry as

764
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:05,038

765
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:07,278

00:28:07,278 --> 00:28:12,720

768
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:15,278
to provide 20 grams of concentrate or 60

769
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:17,120
grams of flour evening the playing field

770
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:18,960
for smaller producers

771
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:21,439
their submission is broken down into

772
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:24,640
judges packs at intake and distributed

773
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,640
just a few hours later

774
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:30,960
the competitors will have a week to

775
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,799

776
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,558
ceremony

777
00:28:32,798 --> 00:28:37,038
are you excited to judge it oh yeah

778
00:28:34,558 --> 00:28:39,918
definitely they will score the entries 1

779
00:28:37,038 --> 00:28:42,398
to 10 in various categories some places

780
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:45,038
have more competitors than others but

781
00:28:42,398 --> 00:28:47,038
who will win is always a mystery all

782
00:28:45,038 --> 00:28:49,278
that is known for sure is that the

783
00:28:47,038 --> 00:28:51,599
competition will be stiff between these

784
00:28:49,278 --> 00:28:54,880
masters of the cannabis craft everybody

785
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:56,398
in this in this competition was

786
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,679
like

787
00:28:56,398 --> 00:28:59,519
everybody knocked it out of the park

788
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:00,480
they're all there for a reason it's all

789
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:01,519
good

790
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,200
so it's

791
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:05,200
you know they call it extract art for a

792
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:07,120
reason because it's people's art and you

793
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:09,120
know it's it's hard to say which one is

794
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:11,599
better you know i i was an attendee

795
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:13,359
always at the original and the cannabis

796
00:29:11,599 --> 00:29:15,519
cup in amsterdam was the only event you

797
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:17,759
wait one year and you fly across the

798
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:20,480
seas and you got to go to one event a

799
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:22,720
year in amsterdam and

800
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:25,120
now now we're here there's all kinds of

801
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,720
events and it's all changing and i think

802
00:29:25,119 --> 00:29:27,918
it's really really great

803
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,079
when high time started doing their

804
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:33,038
events in the united states they were

805
00:29:30,079 --> 00:29:35,439
now allowing the boost to sell cannabis

806
00:29:33,038 --> 00:29:37,119
actually a few other events did this too

807
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:40,000
on a smaller scale

808
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:41,839
but i times did it really big and i

809
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,558
remember going to that event and

810
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:46,158
thinking oh my god this is really new

811
00:29:44,558 --> 00:29:47,519
and different from even the amsterdam

812
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:49,278
events

813
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:51,759
it still wasn't as cool as that

814
00:29:49,278 --> 00:29:54,720
experience really but it was the best we

815
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:58,158
got so far for the us i'm one of very

816
00:29:54,720 --> 00:30:00,159
few people that got my love for events

817
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:02,559
by going to events

818
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:04,320
and being inspired and building these

819
00:30:02,558 --> 00:30:06,879
friendships

820
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:09,119
i think that's really unique

821
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:12,080
and most of the people that are involved

822
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:14,158
in them now never spent a dollar to just

823
00:30:12,079 --> 00:30:16,398
go to enjoy the event without promoting

824
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:18,720
some business or something entirely

825
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:20,879
business related growing up not being

826
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:23,120
part of anybody's tribe

827
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:25,600
feeling like you're an outcast and very

828
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:27,038
different then you go to this event

829
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:28,079
and there's all these different kinds of

830
00:30:27,038 --> 00:30:29,440
people

831
00:30:28,079 --> 00:30:31,439
but

832
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:33,440
they're somehow like you

833
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:36,480
and you start to feel like

834
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:38,798
it's okay to be the way that i am like

835
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:40,960
these things that i like

836
00:30:38,798 --> 00:30:43,200
and in fact maybe i'm gonna get more

837
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:45,679
into it start enjoying these things in a

838
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,440
more celebratory way not just in the

839
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:49,038
shadows

840
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:53,360
and that shouldn't be something that you

841
00:30:49,038 --> 00:30:53,359
get only once a year in amsterdam

842
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:05,919
when events started to happen in

843
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:07,840
california i was all for it and i wanted

844
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:09,600
to support all of those events and see

845
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:11,199
where they went

846
00:31:09,599 --> 00:31:13,199
but for high times

847
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:15,600
there was a stigma that followed their

848
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:17,120
competition

849
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:19,199
over in amsterdam

850
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:22,639
people had started to say that the

851
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,640
competitions were fixed

852
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:28,558
i can say the winners were not the

853
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:29,840
authentic best in the competition so how

854
00:31:28,558 --> 00:31:33,119
were they winning

855
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:35,038
these big companies obviously people

856
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:36,639
thought they were paying or cheating in

857
00:31:35,038 --> 00:31:38,398
some sort of way

858
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:41,038
and i have enough experience now that i

859
00:31:38,398 --> 00:31:42,479
could say that's not true

860
00:31:41,038 --> 00:31:44,398
may have happened

861
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:46,880
but it was marketing that was mostly

862
00:31:44,398 --> 00:31:49,439
winning the events because it's much

863
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:52,080
easier to convince people that you have

864
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:53,200
the best than to authentically produce

865
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:55,918
the best

866
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,880
and high times got a bunch of bad press

867
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:58,799
just because of the way their

868
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,080
competitions worked it was all about

869
00:31:58,798 --> 00:32:02,000
building your brand there so these

870
00:32:00,079 --> 00:32:03,599
people would like some of the a lot of

871
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,119
the attendees were fans of these

872
00:32:03,599 --> 00:32:07,199
hashmakers so they'd go out and they'd

873
00:32:05,119 --> 00:32:08,879
actually be able to meet them and dab

874
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,720
their personal stuff and like form

875
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,720
personal connections with these brands

876
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:14,399
that you know sometimes they had they'd

877
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,480
already been supporting

878
00:32:14,398 --> 00:32:19,518
sometimes that they had just seen and

879
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,519
really wanted to try

880
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:24,240
[Music]

881
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:25,839
this event i'm all about having each

882
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:29,919
event have their

883
00:32:25,839 --> 00:32:32,158
have its own unique you know terms or

884
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:34,080
you know judging rules or whatever you

885
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:35,440
know like every event i like that it's

886
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:38,158
its own thing

887
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:41,278
um and this clearly wasn't just like

888
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:43,278
regurgitation of uh high times or

889
00:32:41,278 --> 00:32:44,960
anything like that it was its own unique

890
00:32:43,278 --> 00:32:46,880
thing from the get-go and like knowing

891
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:49,519
jeremy and dan i know they just really

892
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:51,760
care about hash and um you know like

893
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:53,440
they're very caring people jeremy helps

894
00:32:51,759 --> 00:32:56,480
me with chalice

895
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:58,240
you know the chalice festival and he

896
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,919
does it for the community and he does it

897
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,120
because he cares you know

898
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:03,038
and uh

899
00:33:01,119 --> 00:33:05,278
that's what i love about these two guys

900
00:33:03,038 --> 00:33:06,558
you know and they really uh they're fr

901
00:33:05,278 --> 00:33:08,839
it's from the heart

902
00:33:06,558 --> 00:33:11,278
we have a really good mix of people who

903
00:33:08,839 --> 00:33:13,439
compete and

904
00:33:11,278 --> 00:33:16,558
everyone kind of works together to make

905
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,558
the secret cup happen

906
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:23,440
wasted to taste it

907
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,679
it's about the taste

908
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:27,440
and people bring all these great things

909
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:29,600
to the table they they

910
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:31,440
for free you know they'll give

911
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:32,639
their product or something from

912
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:35,120
themselves

913
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:36,960
and and just to make it better for their

914
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:39,599
city or the other people that are

915
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:41,120
attending and so

916
00:33:39,599 --> 00:33:43,199
that's probably the thing that's the

917
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:45,599
same and it's amazing that we are able

918
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:48,558
to find these really unique and

919
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:51,038
helpful people in every city that make

920
00:33:48,558 --> 00:33:52,960
it possible i think it's the bond with

921
00:33:51,038 --> 00:33:54,640
like the brothers that we have here with

922
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,919
all the hashmakers and

923
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:58,480
the knowledge that actually is being

924
00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:00,240
spread amongst uh amongst us now and

925
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,759
well like i said 2012 was a lot

926
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:03,440
different where people were i think

927
00:34:01,759 --> 00:34:04,798
scared to give their technique out and

928
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,640
all these things because of business you

929
00:34:04,798 --> 00:34:08,239
know and now everyone i think is getting

930
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,599
it like there's a lot of business and

931
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:11,519
man we can all teach each other and

932
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:13,359
maybe grow from this and at least that's

933
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:15,358
where my mindset is i can't really speak

934
00:34:13,358 --> 00:34:16,960
for everyone else but i feel like if you

935
00:34:15,358 --> 00:34:18,960
want change right then that has to be

936
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:20,240
within yourself so if i really want

937
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:22,079
something to be different then i need to

938
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:23,759
change it from right here

939
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:25,519
and that's what we're doing i saw it as

940
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:28,320
a networking event a lot of people saw

941
00:34:25,519 --> 00:34:30,639
it as a party uh but this was like

942
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:32,480
high-level networking that was like

943
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:35,200
causing lanes to open up all over the

944
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:37,838
country

945
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:39,519
when we developed the event we

946
00:34:37,838 --> 00:34:40,719
tried to think about the things that we

947
00:34:39,519 --> 00:34:42,079
didn't like

948
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:45,118
that

949
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:46,960
weren't just personal opinion uh things

950
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:48,399
that we didn't like about the other

951
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,878
events

952
00:34:48,398 --> 00:34:52,159
we tried to think fundamentally what was

953
00:34:50,878 --> 00:34:54,878
wrong with them

954
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:57,358
if we could improve the fairness

955
00:34:54,878 --> 00:35:00,239
we wanted to make them more accurate

956
00:34:57,358 --> 00:35:02,000
representations of what our culture is

957
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:03,279
really about i've entered a lot of high

958
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,880
times cups i've entered a lot of

959
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:06,480
different competitions what always ends

960
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:09,680
up happening is nine times out of ten

961
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:12,159
they hire someone like wiz khalifa or

962
00:35:09,679 --> 00:35:14,399
snoop dogg the judge and he doesn't know

963
00:35:12,159 --> 00:35:16,399
a thing about growing he may know what

964
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,680
weed he likes and what wedi doesn't like

965
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,920
but he doesn't know anything about

966
00:35:17,679 --> 00:35:21,838
growing and so you get a lot of things

967
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:24,880
and like for instance it's a lot harder

968
00:35:21,838 --> 00:35:27,599
to take a wee a 16-week sativa full all

969
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:29,519
the way cure it properly and have it be

970
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:31,519
dense hard resonance that's a lot harder

971
00:35:29,519 --> 00:35:33,838
to do than it is to grow cookies at

972
00:35:31,519 --> 00:35:35,440
eight weeks which frosts up for everyone

973
00:35:33,838 --> 00:35:37,358
so you know there's a lot of things that

974
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:39,838
aren't taken into consideration because

975
00:35:37,358 --> 00:35:41,440
the people judging aren't hands on when

976
00:35:39,838 --> 00:35:44,078
it comes to the secret cup everyone

977
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:46,000
judging is also entering so they do this

978
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:47,920
on a daily basis they understand what to

979
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,358
look for they understand what not to

980
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:51,280
look for what they like what they don't

981
00:35:49,358 --> 00:35:53,838
like and it reflects in the judging you

982
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:55,280
know nine times out of ten you know when

983
00:35:53,838 --> 00:35:56,880
you look at the people that win first

984
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:59,040
second or third place they deserve to be

985
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:02,480
there and that's that says something

986
00:35:59,039 --> 00:36:02,480
about the competition in and of itself

987
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:06,800
so when we were first doing the events

988
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,880
we had

989
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:11,440
really a lot of support from everyone in

990
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:13,838
the industry so the well-known brands

991
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:16,559
were entering the well-known hashmakers

992
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:17,679
all the biggest companies wanted to be a

993
00:36:16,559 --> 00:36:20,239
part of it

994
00:36:17,679 --> 00:36:22,239
and then as we started doing the events

995
00:36:20,239 --> 00:36:23,919
and they couldn't even place in the top

996
00:36:22,239 --> 00:36:25,919
three

997
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:28,000
you started to realize these big brands

998
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:30,240
had a lot to lose by entering these

999
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,119
competitions with these smaller

1000
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:33,838
more

1001
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:35,838
passionate growers and hashmakers and

1002
00:36:33,838 --> 00:36:38,239
they were universally defeating these

1003
00:36:35,838 --> 00:36:41,119
big companies at every event in every

1004
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:42,799
part of the country even internationally

1005
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:46,000
when we did our events

1006
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:47,920
in spain and in amsterdam both times

1007
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,559
people from the uk

1008
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:53,119
traveled there and won the events and

1009
00:36:50,559 --> 00:36:56,559
there's no medical cannabis in the uk

1010
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:58,480
there's no legal cannabis of any kind in

1011
00:36:56,559 --> 00:37:00,799
the uk so

1012
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:03,599
these people are risking their lives

1013
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:05,359
and when they would show up at the event

1014
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:07,760
they reminded me of all of our people in

1015
00:37:05,358 --> 00:37:09,679
california they were at that level and

1016
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:12,160
you're going to start to see that as

1017
00:37:09,679 --> 00:37:14,319
cannabis becomes more open without you

1018
00:37:12,159 --> 00:37:16,719
guys in the community we would not be

1019
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:18,240
able to throw an event anywhere so give

1020
00:37:16,719 --> 00:37:20,480
yourselves a big round of applause for

1021
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:21,759
being part of the 17th community

1022
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,920
remember when we first started throwing

1023
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:26,480
them we would put really really really

1024
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:28,159
long tables with like power outlets

1025
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:30,400
underneath the tables and set them up

1026
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:32,319
and like throw out like candy and waters

1027
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,920
and stuff for people just to go at it

1028
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:35,599
like we could have made so much more

1029
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:37,200
money they wouldn't have remembered it

1030
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:39,599
the rest of their lives and the people

1031
00:37:37,199 --> 00:37:42,078
that got to go remember it this is why i

1032
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:45,440
wanted a secret cup here in dc i have

1033
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:46,480
been traveling forever outside of dc uh

1034
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,320
going to

1035
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:51,358
cannabis cups going to events going to

1036
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:53,200
the west coast where it's really

1037
00:37:51,358 --> 00:37:54,559
you know three times ahead of where

1038
00:37:53,199 --> 00:37:56,480
we're at because you have the

1039
00:37:54,559 --> 00:38:00,239
temperature you have the ability for

1040
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:01,599
people to flex that experience and um i

1041
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:03,279
wanted to see how that would have

1042
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:05,680
happened over here

1043
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:07,119
and just as i you know kind of saw it in

1044
00:38:05,679 --> 00:38:09,519
my head

1045
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:10,880
um you know first out of dc you know

1046
00:38:09,519 --> 00:38:12,320
most of the things that you saw were

1047
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:16,400
just fairly

1048
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:18,320
okay and homegrown um i wanted people to

1049
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:20,960
understand that there's more out there

1050
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:22,960
um there's gold oils there are you know

1051
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:25,039
trees that look like christmas you know

1052
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:27,440
uh you know a christmas tree dusted in

1053
00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:29,599
snow the secret cup was like

1054
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:33,240
a party that made you feel exclusive

1055
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:33,240
just because you were there

1056
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:46,280
i got it

1057
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,400
oh

1058
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:58,599
[Music]

1059
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:02,400
i mean it was something different you

1060
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:04,800
know than the high times events which

1061
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:06,240
i'd been to and i'm a fan of i i enjoyed

1062
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,519
it but this was another level you had a

1063
00:39:06,239 --> 00:39:09,199
lot of the people that came out that

1064
00:39:07,519 --> 00:39:11,358
were smokers that

1065
00:39:09,199 --> 00:39:12,719
they just wanted to you know they just

1066
00:39:11,358 --> 00:39:14,400
wanted to smoke weed and they weren't

1067
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:16,159
really about

1068
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,680
the higher end of things and that's

1069
00:39:16,159 --> 00:39:19,358
where the secret cup came into places

1070
00:39:17,679 --> 00:39:20,480
and that's where it gave a place for

1071
00:39:19,358 --> 00:39:23,039
people that weren't into that kind of

1072
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:24,639
stuff so i asked dan if i could you know

1073
00:39:23,039 --> 00:39:26,320
put together a song for him i wanted to

1074
00:39:24,639 --> 00:39:28,239
do a top shelf song

1075
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:30,320
for appreciation and he said no i got

1076
00:39:28,239 --> 00:39:31,199
this secret cup mixtape that i wanted to

1077
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,640
put out

1078
00:39:31,199 --> 00:39:34,000
so you should do a song about the secret

1079
00:39:32,639 --> 00:39:37,598
cup because we're about to start doing

1080
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,960
them in other cities and expanding so

1081
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:41,039
so i ended up putting together the

1082
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:43,039
secret cup anthem i came out to denver

1083
00:39:41,039 --> 00:39:45,199
for the finals and i had two verses done

1084
00:39:43,039 --> 00:39:46,719
in the hook and i wrapped it for dan and

1085
00:39:45,199 --> 00:39:48,319
jeremy and they're like oh this shit is

1086
00:39:46,719 --> 00:39:49,519
amazing all right i'll put together the

1087
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:51,920
third verse

1088
00:39:49,519 --> 00:39:54,000
after the event from the experiences and

1089
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:56,800
that's really what it is it's just the

1090
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,559
songs are all like a story of my life

1091
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:00,560
so this was what that was it was just

1092
00:39:58,559 --> 00:40:02,159
documenting my times at the secret cup

1093
00:40:00,559 --> 00:40:05,199
and especially that third verse was just

1094
00:40:02,159 --> 00:40:07,118
like soaking up that finals event

1095
00:40:05,199 --> 00:40:09,519
mortimer out there rocking her belt that

1096
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:11,358
energy of everybody in the place just uh

1097
00:40:09,519 --> 00:40:14,000
having a great time it's always peaceful

1098
00:40:11,358 --> 00:40:16,318
there's never problems at the events

1099
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,480
just being around so many like-minded

1100
00:40:16,318 --> 00:40:21,599
people so many people that are into the

1101
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:23,838
same thing you are that appreciate the

1102
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:26,318
same things you do

1103
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:28,000
and it's not just it's not just the hash

1104
00:40:26,318 --> 00:40:29,920
i mean it's uh it's everything else too

1105
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,960
it's all the trappings of the culture

1106
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,960
um

1107
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:35,599
intense love of glass art

1108
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:37,599
that everybody shares a chance to meet

1109
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:39,119
people that are actually making medicine

1110
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:41,380
the chance to meet people that are

1111
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:43,309
actually making the glass art

1112
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:46,360
[Music]

1113
00:40:43,309 --> 00:40:46,360
[Applause]

1114
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:50,800
so when we were doing the secret cup one

1115
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:53,359
of the things that i wanted to

1116
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:55,599
incorporate into it were some of the

1117
00:40:53,358 --> 00:40:58,559
stereotypical

1118
00:40:55,599 --> 00:41:01,200
things about cannabis that go along with

1119
00:40:58,559 --> 00:41:03,119
the whole culture i myself i believe

1120
00:41:01,199 --> 00:41:05,199
really strongly that

1121
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:07,920
cannabis and art are

1122
00:41:05,199 --> 00:41:10,879
really closely connected you've all

1123
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:13,760
heard stories of this musician talking

1124
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:15,358
about cannabis influencing their art so

1125
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:18,480
we wanted to incorporate some of that

1126
00:41:15,358 --> 00:41:18,480
into the seeker cup

1127
00:41:18,639 --> 00:41:23,519
we had live glassblowing at almost all

1128
00:41:20,719 --> 00:41:26,239
of the events and glassblowing for me is

1129
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:29,519
a really important part of the culture

1130
00:41:26,239 --> 00:41:32,838
for a long long time head shops

1131
00:41:29,519 --> 00:41:35,679
were the main meeting point for

1132
00:41:32,838 --> 00:41:37,119
stoners when you

1133
00:41:35,679 --> 00:41:39,039
got in trouble

1134
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:41,039
a lot of times that was your only

1135
00:41:39,039 --> 00:41:42,880
opportunity to still be in the cannabis

1136
00:41:41,039 --> 00:41:45,599
industry in some sort of way you could

1137
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:47,599
work at a head shop and that was okay

1138
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:50,318
the glass

1139
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:52,160
aspects of cannabis has been one of the

1140
00:41:50,318 --> 00:41:54,079
things that pushed the culture forward

1141
00:41:52,159 --> 00:41:57,039
so so glass was very simple in the very

1142
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:59,599
beginning and as it has innovated and

1143
00:41:57,039 --> 00:42:01,039
become more intricate and more diverse

1144
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:03,519
in the colors and all the different

1145
00:42:01,039 --> 00:42:05,920
things it's pushed the whole culture

1146
00:42:03,519 --> 00:42:08,480
forward in a classy and really

1147
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:10,079
respectable way the first secret cup i

1148
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:11,440
did was the first one they did in

1149
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:12,560
california

1150
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,920
and

1151
00:42:12,559 --> 00:42:16,559
i mean that's one of my favorite

1152
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:18,720
memories blowing glass live because i've

1153
00:42:16,559 --> 00:42:20,559
done it before but for head shop owners

1154
00:42:18,719 --> 00:42:21,679
and they appreciate it but this was the

1155
00:42:20,559 --> 00:42:22,480
crowd of

1156
00:42:21,679 --> 00:42:24,480
like

1157
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:26,400
virgin eyes for that kind of thing so

1158
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:28,318
you had a whole bunch of people just

1159
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:30,480
staring at you and i mean

1160
00:42:28,318 --> 00:42:33,358
i remember the event

1161
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:35,440
the crowd was at the glass demo i mean

1162
00:42:33,358 --> 00:42:37,119
that was where the most of the people

1163
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:39,519
that attended the event they had music

1164
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:41,599
going on and the the vendor booths with

1165
00:42:39,519 --> 00:42:43,358
the different hashes and flowers and

1166
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:45,280
things to buy and people were buying for

1167
00:42:43,358 --> 00:42:48,639
sure i'm sure it was a lucrative event

1168
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:49,440
for them but i just remember seeing

1169
00:42:48,639 --> 00:42:51,358
this

1170
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:54,000
like really big crowd of people that

1171
00:42:51,358 --> 00:42:55,519
were all focused on us taking pictures

1172
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,400
and videos and

1173
00:42:55,519 --> 00:42:58,239
um

1174
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:59,680
i see the pictures from that event and i

1175
00:42:58,239 --> 00:43:01,919
mean it just looks cool we were blowing

1176
00:42:59,679 --> 00:43:04,239
glass in front of this huge

1177
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:06,720
graffiti murals on these train tracks

1178
00:43:04,239 --> 00:43:08,639
that were defunct um but i mean we were

1179
00:43:06,719 --> 00:43:10,399
literally set up on the train tracks and

1180
00:43:08,639 --> 00:43:11,199
the pictures are just really cool it

1181
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:14,079
wasn't

1182
00:43:11,199 --> 00:43:15,598
a huge area so the crowd looks tight you

1183
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:16,880
know it looks like there's a lot more

1184
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:19,519
people there that may have been there

1185
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:22,240
but it was still a really large crowd

1186
00:43:19,519 --> 00:43:23,440
super huge fan of glassblowing

1187
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:25,598
i grew up

1188
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:26,960
around some really amazing glassblowers

1189
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:28,800
that i'm like

1190
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:30,559
in a way baffled that they're not taking

1191
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:32,480
advantage of all this like what's going

1192
00:43:30,559 --> 00:43:33,679
on around them you know and some of them

1193
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:35,280
have money and some of them were growing

1194
00:43:33,679 --> 00:43:37,039
whatever else but i just

1195
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:38,640
i felt like they're like missing out on

1196
00:43:37,039 --> 00:43:42,400
this like huge

1197
00:43:38,639 --> 00:43:42,400
opportunity in the glass world right now

1198
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:51,838
and growing up like even before i was

1199
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,480
really deep into the scene like you

1200
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:56,559
would buy glass pipe that you liked at a

1201
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:58,240
head shop or somewhere it would have a

1202
00:43:56,559 --> 00:44:00,239
special meaning to you because you would

1203
00:43:58,239 --> 00:44:01,838
take it around throughout your life and

1204
00:44:00,239 --> 00:44:03,759
you would have all these special moments

1205
00:44:01,838 --> 00:44:05,440
that you shared with this piece and with

1206
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:07,920
other people and

1207
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:10,000
it became kind of part of your whole

1208
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:12,639
journey and then when you would break it

1209
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,920
it was like a loss it was a real tragic

1210
00:44:12,639 --> 00:44:16,078
loss

1211
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:17,760
you would maybe buy a new piece or

1212
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:19,039
something like that and it would start a

1213
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:20,839
new journey

1214
00:44:19,039 --> 00:44:24,079
it was something that

1215
00:44:20,838 --> 00:44:26,719
um you know became really special

1216
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:27,760
and and as i learn more and more about

1217
00:44:26,719 --> 00:44:29,919
glass

1218
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:31,839
you know i think that that is something

1219
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:33,440
that's under appreciated

1220
00:44:31,838 --> 00:44:35,358
people kind of don't even realize that

1221
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:37,200
they have this relationship with their

1222
00:44:35,358 --> 00:44:39,039
glass pipe or their glass bong or

1223
00:44:37,199 --> 00:44:41,439
whatever it is

1224
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:43,199
i mean i think that concentrates had a

1225
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:45,440
big role on how

1226
00:44:43,199 --> 00:44:46,639
glass manufacturing has been changed

1227
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,760
you've watched

1228
00:44:46,639 --> 00:44:50,719
you know

1229
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:54,160
pieces go from being the four foot bong

1230
00:44:50,719 --> 00:44:54,159
to being the four inch rig

1231
00:44:54,960 --> 00:45:01,440
that you you it's very hard to walk into

1232
00:44:57,838 --> 00:45:03,199
a head shop and find a piece that has a

1233
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:05,920
down stem for a flower bowl now

1234
00:45:03,199 --> 00:45:08,639
everything's got a male ground joint for

1235
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:10,720
a dome or a domeless nail

1236
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:12,799
so it's it's been interesting to watch

1237
00:45:10,719 --> 00:45:15,759
it evolve and obviously the internet's

1238
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:18,318
had its role in that by

1239
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:20,640
giving everybody the immediate access to

1240
00:45:18,318 --> 00:45:22,719
information

1241
00:45:20,639 --> 00:45:23,679
where it would normally take word of

1242
00:45:22,719 --> 00:45:25,679
mouth

1243
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:27,838
a long time to spread

1244
00:45:25,679 --> 00:45:30,000
geographically the internet allows it to

1245
00:45:27,838 --> 00:45:32,880
just spread like overnight

1246
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:35,280
i think this is what's putting us uh the

1247
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:37,200
whole the hashmakers and all that kind

1248
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:39,119
of in the forefront and it's vice it's

1249
00:45:37,199 --> 00:45:40,799
like we're piggybacking off each other

1250
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:44,240
because they go hand in hand and this

1251
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:47,119
revolution is like it's amazing

1252
00:45:44,239 --> 00:45:48,879
glass had to change when the kind of

1253
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:52,000
hash that we smoked

1254
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:54,960
started to turn into a liquid and so the

1255
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:57,358
tools that were being used originally

1256
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:58,400
became much more diverse

1257
00:45:57,358 --> 00:46:00,400
and

1258
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:02,639
when we entered the cannabis cup we were

1259
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:04,800
entering with one of the very first

1260
00:46:02,639 --> 00:46:06,318
dabbing tools that were

1261
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:10,560
out there

1262
00:46:06,318 --> 00:46:13,838
and as time progressed those tools have

1263
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:16,400
become so innovative that that original

1264
00:46:13,838 --> 00:46:19,440
tool is basically obsolete nobody uses

1265
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:23,200
it anymore just hitting it purely off

1266
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:25,679
the the titanium device

1267
00:46:23,199 --> 00:46:28,239
all you were getting was that oil

1268
00:46:25,679 --> 00:46:30,318
and it was getting vaporized super quick

1269
00:46:28,239 --> 00:46:32,399
it wasn't smoke it's not setting it on

1270
00:46:30,318 --> 00:46:35,679
fire you're just getting it so hot that

1271
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:39,119
it changes from a plasma to a gas and

1272
00:46:35,679 --> 00:46:41,118
you inhale it and it bypasses your

1273
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:43,599
the the what is it the blood brain

1274
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:44,800
barrier and just instantly

1275
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:47,440
high

1276
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:49,200
and the thing is it's really easy to

1277
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:50,800
you know sort of regulate your dosage

1278
00:46:49,199 --> 00:46:53,039
too

1279
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:55,280
oh you smoked on my dab

1280
00:46:53,039 --> 00:46:57,519
you smoke all of my dab

1281
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:58,720
when dabbing came onto the scene it

1282
00:46:57,519 --> 00:47:00,880
really uh

1283
00:46:58,719 --> 00:47:03,919
it changed everything it gave

1284
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:05,280
us artists a new outlet to make things

1285
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:07,680
because now we're coming up with

1286
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:09,760
entirely new accessories that haven't

1287
00:47:07,679 --> 00:47:11,519
been thought up before

1288
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:14,319
all right so

1289
00:47:11,519 --> 00:47:17,280
this right here kind of

1290
00:47:14,318 --> 00:47:20,239
changed everything for

1291
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:21,839
the glass industry this is dabbing

1292
00:47:20,239 --> 00:47:23,679
what this is is

1293
00:47:21,838 --> 00:47:26,159
um concentrated

1294
00:47:23,679 --> 00:47:27,519
thc oil or hash oil

1295
00:47:26,159 --> 00:47:29,519
and

1296
00:47:27,519 --> 00:47:31,280
so we're heating up this nail

1297
00:47:29,519 --> 00:47:32,960
which is made of quartz on one of our

1298
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:37,480
glass rigs

1299
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:37,480
let me get this nail nice and hot

1300
00:47:41,039 --> 00:47:44,079
there's no combustion you're not burning

1301
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:46,640
any

1302
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:48,880
any plant material at all the first time

1303
00:47:46,639 --> 00:47:51,279
i saw someone take a dab

1304
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:54,079
i was at uh

1305
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:56,559
at mers house and he's since passed away

1306
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:58,640
but he was a well-known glassblower in

1307
00:47:56,559 --> 00:48:02,240
our industry and um

1308
00:47:58,639 --> 00:48:04,480
i showed up at his house and i see this

1309
00:48:02,239 --> 00:48:06,799
torch in this rig just like that except

1310
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:07,920
we had titanium at the time and it was a

1311
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:09,680
swing

1312
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:11,358
and they're heating it up and taking

1313
00:48:09,679 --> 00:48:13,279
dabs and i'm like oh my gosh are you

1314
00:48:11,358 --> 00:48:15,199
guys doing drugs here you know that's

1315
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:17,280
what i was thinking because you know i

1316
00:48:15,199 --> 00:48:19,598
never associate cannabis with that kind

1317
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:20,400
of thought but yeah i didn't know what's

1318
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:23,039
going on

1319
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:25,280
they explained to me the process and

1320
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:27,119
i mean it's like a whole different way

1321
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:29,599
to consume cannabis

1322
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:31,519
and now we have a whole different

1323
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:35,359
line of things we need to make we made

1324
00:48:31,519 --> 00:48:38,079
these like swings um it was basically a

1325
00:48:35,358 --> 00:48:40,239
funnel that was bent and you'd

1326
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:42,640
sell these swings like this to other

1327
00:48:40,239 --> 00:48:45,118
companies and they would wrap them with

1328
00:48:42,639 --> 00:48:46,558
metal in fact um

1329
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:48,160
this is one

1330
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:50,319
that

1331
00:48:48,159 --> 00:48:53,279
was one of the first companies that kind

1332
00:48:50,318 --> 00:48:55,279
of marketed the swings they asked me

1333
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:56,800
to make and i did pattern work ones and

1334
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:58,800
then i did these

1335
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:00,839
sculpted ones and looking back i mean

1336
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:03,680
these are really

1337
00:49:00,838 --> 00:49:06,239
rough um but what they were doing was

1338
00:49:03,679 --> 00:49:08,078
wrapping this titanium pad

1339
00:49:06,239 --> 00:49:10,479
around the swing

1340
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:12,480
around the glass and calling it a swing

1341
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:14,400
because it swings back and forth so

1342
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:16,159
you'd heat this up

1343
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:18,000
and once it was glowing you'd swing it

1344
00:49:16,159 --> 00:49:20,159
back down and get your dab ready and you

1345
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,679
just drop it and that's what this little

1346
00:49:20,159 --> 00:49:24,078
opening was for so you could get your

1347
00:49:21,679 --> 00:49:25,440
dab tool in there and vaporize it and

1348
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:27,680
you don't see

1349
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:29,599
very many people use using the swings

1350
00:49:27,679 --> 00:49:31,358
anymore um

1351
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:33,200
you know every now and then i probably

1352
00:49:31,358 --> 00:49:34,558
make one a year

1353
00:49:33,199 --> 00:49:37,039
someone will hit me up and they want

1354
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:39,680
like a classic rig so we started making

1355
00:49:37,039 --> 00:49:42,079
the swings and then nails came out and

1356
00:49:39,679 --> 00:49:44,799
domes and uh

1357
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:47,599
that's a whole thing that's like

1358
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:49,599
come and gone like that that time that

1359
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:50,640
time it's weird because it's still so

1360
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:52,720
new

1361
00:49:50,639 --> 00:49:55,279
um but there's

1362
00:49:52,719 --> 00:49:58,000
trends that have come and gone

1363
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:59,119
and now everyone uses some form of a

1364
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,119
banger

1365
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:03,838
and even those are becoming a little

1366
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:06,559
different and taking on different shapes

1367
00:50:03,838 --> 00:50:09,519
and cannabis in general is just a very

1368
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:11,599
fast-moving innovative business

1369
00:50:09,519 --> 00:50:13,759
the thing that is popular this year

1370
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:15,680
might be completely obsolete by the end

1371
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:18,000
of the next year so

1372
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:19,118
you have to stay on top of it really

1373
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,838
really

1374
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:24,079
all the time and having these events and

1375
00:50:21,838 --> 00:50:27,358
all the different cities that helped us

1376
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:30,318
to constantly be on the pulse of where

1377
00:50:27,358 --> 00:50:30,318
cannabis was going

1378
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:42,499
now we're thinking

1379
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:42,499
[Music]

1380
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:49,839
you know the rigs and the dab

1381
00:50:47,519 --> 00:50:52,880
scene is big so a lot of the more higher

1382
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:52,880
end pieces are going to be

1383
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:58,559
uh styled and engineered to do dabs

1384
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:59,920
whereas a lot of the flower pieces are

1385
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:02,000
made differently they have a different

1386
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:03,599
way the diffusers go in and things like

1387
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:06,480
that it's because you know without the

1388
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:08,960
dabbing rigs like i said in 1999 we were

1389
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:10,719
making oil there wasn't no dab rigs then

1390
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:12,960
though like we're pouring that shit on

1391
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:14,719
on buds and like killing our throat and

1392
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:16,720
lungs and it was a horrible way to do

1393
00:51:14,719 --> 00:51:18,000
oil and some people tried to hot knife

1394
00:51:16,719 --> 00:51:20,159
it and stuff but

1395
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,920
um i just think that that's

1396
00:51:20,159 --> 00:51:23,358
like i said it's piggybacking off each

1397
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:26,639
other so it's like a

1398
00:51:23,358 --> 00:51:27,519
it's a beautiful dynamic you know like

1399
00:51:26,639 --> 00:51:30,159
it's

1400
00:51:27,519 --> 00:51:32,400
it's future it's what it is you know

1401
00:51:30,159 --> 00:51:34,399
i think vaporizing the oil and stuff is

1402
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:36,720
the future like no more smoking the

1403
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:38,480
flower and i love flowers of death but i

1404
00:51:36,719 --> 00:51:40,719
just really feel like vaporizing even

1405
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:42,159
vaporizing flower i guess is better than

1406
00:51:40,719 --> 00:51:44,480
not you know

1407
00:51:42,159 --> 00:51:45,679
i think dabbing is still the future dude

1408
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:47,679
there's all these youngsters that want

1409
00:51:45,679 --> 00:51:49,519
to be a part of it still like haven't

1410
00:51:47,679 --> 00:51:51,919
got to experience all this you know and

1411
00:51:49,519 --> 00:51:54,239
now these certain states are becoming 21

1412
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:56,880
years of age to partake these kids are

1413
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:59,439
like wow i can't wait to be 21.

1414
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:00,960
people need to see the the stuff if it's

1415
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:04,240
made properly

1416
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:06,559
it's not dangerous and in fact can

1417
00:52:04,239 --> 00:52:07,759
really approach like connoisseur grade

1418
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:10,240
levels

1419
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:12,079
um i want people to know what's possible

1420
00:52:10,239 --> 00:52:13,358
like the magic that you can get out of

1421
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:14,960
this plant

1422
00:52:13,358 --> 00:52:17,119
i want people to

1423
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:19,920
know how to smoke it know how to judge

1424
00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:22,318
the quality of it um have better access

1425
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:24,880
to meds wherever they're from um i want

1426
00:52:22,318 --> 00:52:27,199
all that stuff to happen

1427
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:29,358
so when you attended a secret cup a lot

1428
00:52:27,199 --> 00:52:32,480
of times you're being exposed to the

1429
00:52:29,358 --> 00:52:34,639
next new trend in cannabis people would

1430
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:35,679
show up to the secret cup

1431
00:52:34,639 --> 00:52:37,118
and

1432
00:52:35,679 --> 00:52:38,719
sometimes they would have worked on

1433
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:41,760
something for like

1434
00:52:38,719 --> 00:52:44,318
you know maybe a year long and they'd

1435
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:46,480
have this wonderful story of the plant

1436
00:52:44,318 --> 00:52:48,800
that they grew or where their

1437
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:50,800
concentrate came from sometimes it was

1438
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:52,000
like a new technique

1439
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:53,039
and

1440
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,920
i've even

1441
00:52:53,039 --> 00:52:56,239
had

1442
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:58,400
you know my eyes opened on things that i

1443
00:52:56,239 --> 00:52:59,838
didn't think were possible like i've had

1444
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:03,200
a alcohol

1445
00:52:59,838 --> 00:53:04,480
extraction oil that was phenomenal

1446
00:53:03,199 --> 00:53:05,838
tasting

1447
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:07,519
and

1448
00:53:05,838 --> 00:53:09,440
you know there's just been

1449
00:53:07,519 --> 00:53:10,559
numerous things that

1450
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:11,440
um

1451
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:14,240
even

1452
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:17,200
me as somebody who had experienced quite

1453
00:53:14,239 --> 00:53:18,000
a lot in cannabis

1454
00:53:17,199 --> 00:53:20,078
i

1455
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,838
constantly am having my eyes open to new

1456
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:24,400
things and i love that about the secret

1457
00:53:21,838 --> 00:53:27,519
cup the innovation the real innovation

1458
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:29,519
because people that were into that whole

1459
00:53:27,519 --> 00:53:31,358
part of the events

1460
00:53:29,519 --> 00:53:32,880
the the seeker cup was the kind of event

1461
00:53:31,358 --> 00:53:34,480
that attracted a true cannabis

1462
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:36,240
connoisseur somebody that had really

1463
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:37,599
learned the history

1464
00:53:36,239 --> 00:53:40,078
and

1465
00:53:37,599 --> 00:53:42,559
a lot of people that were doing really

1466
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:44,318
really cutting edge innovation that's

1467
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:46,480
what i love about these two guys you

1468
00:53:44,318 --> 00:53:49,279
know and they really uh they're it's

1469
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:50,559
from the heart you know and uh

1470
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:52,640
that's

1471
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:54,640
i feel a little more rare

1472
00:53:52,639 --> 00:53:56,480
you know in in

1473
00:53:54,639 --> 00:53:58,719
industry events or whatever that it's

1474
00:53:56,480 --> 00:54:01,280
from someone from the movement from the

1475
00:53:58,719 --> 00:54:03,759
industry it's from you know the soul

1476
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:06,400
and i think everybody notices that

1477
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:08,800
um and and the energy the event has now

1478
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:11,039
and like it means something to win the

1479
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:13,839
event if i don't win first second or

1480
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:16,239
third or any anything um at least i got

1481
00:54:13,838 --> 00:54:18,558
to present myself and my side of the

1482
00:54:16,239 --> 00:54:20,318
story and show people

1483
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:22,480
maybe something that they haven't had

1484
00:54:20,318 --> 00:54:24,880
the opportunity to try and you know

1485
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:27,599
that's a win to me but you know winning

1486
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:30,240
actually winning that would be a large

1487
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:32,079
statement to where the cannabis industry

1488
00:54:30,239 --> 00:54:35,039
is progressing and how

1489
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:36,720
much extract artists care about quality

1490
00:54:35,039 --> 00:54:39,358
clean meds because when you enter a

1491
00:54:36,719 --> 00:54:41,919
solvent-less entry it's zero ppm zero

1492
00:54:39,358 --> 00:54:44,239
it's zero you know solvent is there's no

1493
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:46,079
nothing that can harm you and so when

1494
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:48,639
you have something as loud as my entry

1495
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:51,519
and as flavorful as my entry you know

1496
00:54:48,639 --> 00:54:53,838
and and and to have them recognize that

1497
00:54:51,519 --> 00:54:56,159
recognize what it is as a medicine and

1498
00:54:53,838 --> 00:54:57,440
vote for me to win that would be

1499
00:54:56,159 --> 00:55:00,159
probably one of the highlights of my

1500
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:02,000
life i'd be really stoked not just for

1501
00:55:00,159 --> 00:55:05,440
myself but for the cannabis industry and

1502
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:08,000
where we stand as extract artists

1503
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:10,318
i don't want it to get big

1504
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:12,639
a lot of the other events their goal is

1505
00:55:10,318 --> 00:55:14,960
to get bigger and make more money and

1506
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:17,519
that's never been my goal

1507
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:19,599
my goal has been to provide the best

1508
00:55:17,519 --> 00:55:21,519
experience for the people

1509
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:24,000
that attend the event

1510
00:55:21,519 --> 00:55:25,519
and as we've done the events i know

1511
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,599
where we're lacking

1512
00:55:25,519 --> 00:55:30,239
and i know where we're strong

1513
00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:32,240
and i just want to focus on those kinds

1514
00:55:30,239 --> 00:55:34,959
of things and bring

1515
00:55:32,239 --> 00:55:36,639
to the people some more of the

1516
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:38,960
experiences that they're looking for

1517
00:55:36,639 --> 00:55:40,159
that's one of the hardest things

1518
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:42,480
is uh

1519
00:55:40,159 --> 00:55:44,639
the budget that we're facing but i

1520
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:46,240
believe that people see what we're

1521
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:48,558
trying to do now

1522
00:55:46,239 --> 00:55:51,118
and that's going to open the doors to a

1523
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:52,559
much greater experience for all the

1524
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:54,798
people involved

1525
00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:56,559
i'm really excited that you know i think

1526
00:55:54,798 --> 00:55:58,079
the face of the secret cup's changing a

1527
00:55:56,559 --> 00:56:00,240
little bit and the more knowledge the

1528
00:55:58,079 --> 00:56:01,839
more things are like this we get to

1529
00:56:00,239 --> 00:56:04,558
express it to each other you know i

1530
00:56:01,838 --> 00:56:07,519
really want to break new ground so

1531
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:09,680
uh i like to do different things with

1532
00:56:07,519 --> 00:56:11,358
the events if i keep getting caught up

1533
00:56:09,679 --> 00:56:14,480
in the same pattern

1534
00:56:11,358 --> 00:56:15,920
a lot of times that can be not so fun

1535
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:17,358
you know

1536
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:20,318
the other thing is i want to see

1537
00:56:17,358 --> 00:56:22,480
everybody uh happy and i want to push

1538
00:56:20,318 --> 00:56:24,798
the education so

1539
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:27,519
this message that we've got i want to

1540
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:29,119
get to everyone and

1541
00:56:27,519 --> 00:56:32,079
it's difficult you know we don't have

1542
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:33,119
the platform to speak just yet

1543
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:35,200
and

1544
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:37,200
we're slowly building you know

1545
00:56:35,199 --> 00:56:39,439
i would recommend it to anybody who's a

1546
00:56:37,199 --> 00:56:40,639
connoisseur or someone who strives to

1547
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:42,240
know what

1548
00:56:40,639 --> 00:56:44,719
real

1549
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:46,239
medicine in the cannabis community is

1550
00:56:44,719 --> 00:56:48,399
there's a lot of people that try to pass

1551
00:56:46,239 --> 00:56:51,519
off

1552
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:52,318
you know nugrum or these other terms of

1553
00:56:51,519 --> 00:56:54,318
what

1554
00:56:52,318 --> 00:56:56,639
high quality things should be when

1555
00:56:54,318 --> 00:56:58,880
they're really not anywhere close to it

1556
00:56:56,639 --> 00:57:00,558
and the competitors are a good example

1557
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:02,240
of what

1558
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:04,079
the perfect concentrates or what we

1559
00:57:02,239 --> 00:57:06,078
strive to have should be like and what

1560
00:57:04,079 --> 00:57:07,359
real medicine should be for people that

1561
00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:09,760
need it you know

1562
00:57:07,358 --> 00:57:12,170
and uh yeah i think that's pretty much

1563
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:16,240
it

1564
00:57:12,170 --> 00:57:18,159
[Music]

1565
00:57:16,239 --> 00:57:21,118
the goal was to make it a part of

1566
00:57:18,159 --> 00:57:22,399
regular life and we were successful and

1567
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:24,559
it is now

1568
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:25,440
but what was special

1569
00:57:24,559 --> 00:57:27,680
was

1570
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:29,679
the fact that we were on the fringes on

1571
00:57:27,679 --> 00:57:32,078
the front lines making something happen

1572
00:57:29,679 --> 00:57:36,159
for the first time um and that there was

1573
00:57:32,079 --> 00:57:36,160
risk involved and that was exciting

1574
00:57:37,199 --> 00:57:40,318
how's it going everyone uh i just

1575
00:57:39,119 --> 00:57:42,880
started uh fresh off the butt

1576
00:57:40,318 --> 00:57:44,558
extractions a little while ago uh first

1577
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:47,280
i want to foremost thank uh dan and

1578
00:57:44,559 --> 00:57:49,839
nicotine for hosting this event

1579
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:50,960
there have been a number of times in my

1580
00:57:49,838 --> 00:57:53,119
career

1581
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:54,639
in the cannabis industry

1582
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:57,200
where i

1583
00:57:54,639 --> 00:57:58,798
almost had to pinch myself where i i'm

1584
00:57:57,199 --> 00:58:00,399
like

1585
00:57:58,798 --> 00:58:03,679
think about what you're doing think

1586
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:03,680
about where you are

1587
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:09,119
thanks

1588
00:58:09,199 --> 00:58:13,598
i mean the only way i could compare it

1589
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:15,359
is it's like having like a rock star

1590
00:58:13,599 --> 00:58:16,960
lifestyle you're like

1591
00:58:15,358 --> 00:58:18,159
traveling to these

1592
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:20,480
strange

1593
00:58:18,159 --> 00:58:24,318
unknown places

1594
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:25,440
people are like bringing you into like

1595
00:58:24,318 --> 00:58:27,119
these

1596
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:29,440
grows or these

1597
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:31,358
you know farms that

1598
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:33,280
they don't bring people into and i'm

1599
00:58:31,358 --> 00:58:34,159
gonna bring them attention this is some

1600
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:37,440
sort of

1601
00:58:34,159 --> 00:58:40,159
value a new value to their company that

1602
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:42,798
wasn't something that existed before

1603
00:58:40,159 --> 00:58:44,000
and here i am thankfully i am an

1604
00:58:42,798 --> 00:58:45,599
authentic

1605
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:48,318
cannabis fan

1606
00:58:45,599 --> 00:58:50,559
so they could talk to me and know

1607
00:58:48,318 --> 00:58:51,838
that i'm truly passionate about

1608
00:58:50,559 --> 00:58:53,280
everything and

1609
00:58:51,838 --> 00:58:56,480
they felt a lot more comfortable

1610
00:58:53,280 --> 00:59:00,160
bringing me into these places but it was

1611
00:58:56,480 --> 00:59:00,960
strange you know you could feel

1612
00:59:00,159 --> 00:59:03,199
the

1613
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:06,000
danger and some of the situations you

1614
00:59:03,199 --> 00:59:07,358
know and i'm in oakland

1615
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:09,519
going to this

1616
00:59:07,358 --> 00:59:10,239
different place or that different place

1617
00:59:09,519 --> 00:59:12,239
and

1618
00:59:10,239 --> 00:59:14,159
you know here i am

1619
00:59:12,239 --> 00:59:16,318
you know little me

1620
00:59:14,159 --> 00:59:17,838
and uh some of these people are heavily

1621
00:59:16,318 --> 00:59:20,639
armed

1622
00:59:17,838 --> 00:59:22,880
going to other countries like

1623
00:59:20,639 --> 00:59:24,318
spain dealing with the military police

1624
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:25,200
in spain

1625
00:59:24,318 --> 00:59:27,440
like

1626
00:59:25,199 --> 00:59:29,519
they have cannabis over there but they

1627
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:33,280
they don't necessarily have like legal

1628
00:59:29,519 --> 00:59:34,880
cannabis the way that we have so

1629
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:38,319
it's

1630
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:40,400
constantly an evolving process and

1631
00:59:38,318 --> 00:59:42,400
you know it's it's stressful and

1632
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:43,920
a lot of times you're hating it a lot of

1633
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:47,039
times you're thinking i should have done

1634
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:49,760
a regular job that these risks that i'm

1635
00:59:47,039 --> 00:59:52,960
taking are not worth it

1636
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:55,280
that i'm not getting financially

1637
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:57,039
something that's going to get me set up

1638
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:58,480
for life out of this

1639
00:59:57,039 --> 01:00:00,239
this is just some sort of like

1640
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:01,920
passionate thing that i've got myself

1641
01:00:00,239 --> 01:00:03,679
into because of how much i believe in

1642
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:05,920
this you know for some reason a lot of

1643
01:00:03,679 --> 01:00:08,000
credit comes my way but the fact of the

1644
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:10,079
matter is the the secret cup wouldn't

1645
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:12,239
exist the uh i wouldn't have been able

1646
01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:14,400
to accomplish any of this without jeremy

1647
01:00:12,239 --> 01:00:15,679
i mean he has a he has a mind for events

1648
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:18,160
and he puts in

1649
01:00:15,679 --> 01:00:20,000
all the tough work and anytime he needs

1650
01:00:18,159 --> 01:00:23,519
uh someone needs to be an asshole like

1651
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:23,519
this guy is the one who does it

1652
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:29,200
you know you question well i think it's

1653
01:00:26,719 --> 01:00:30,879
pretty normal to have those moments

1654
01:00:29,199 --> 01:00:32,798
but it's also pretty awesome to have

1655
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:35,680
those triumphs when

1656
01:00:32,798 --> 01:00:37,920
you've won or you you've done something

1657
01:00:35,679 --> 01:00:39,759
especially the events like we've thrown

1658
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:42,720
an event in some sort of

1659
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:44,400
unique place and

1660
01:00:42,719 --> 01:00:46,879
people have like

1661
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:48,798
won awards it's been this really

1662
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:50,480
wonderful thing for

1663
01:00:48,798 --> 01:00:52,880
a lot of people and

1664
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:55,440
a really amazing adventure you feel a

1665
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:58,559
triumph that's not really

1666
01:00:55,440 --> 01:01:00,400
explainable i mean i've vacationed to

1667
01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:03,599
amsterdam many times

1668
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:04,960
when i threw an event in amsterdam

1669
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:07,920
i felt

1670
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:09,280
like a totally different feeling

1671
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:11,760
and

1672
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:14,079
those kind of things are really special

1673
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:14,880
i'm glad to have been a part of it and i

1674
01:01:14,079 --> 01:01:16,559
think

1675
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:17,760
even just for the people that attend the

1676
01:01:16,559 --> 01:01:19,680
events

1677
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:23,450
that they've had some of those really

1678
01:01:19,679 --> 01:01:26,480
special moments too

1679
01:01:23,449 --> 01:01:29,199
[Music]

1680
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:31,760
local laws are what determines what

1681
01:01:29,199 --> 01:01:33,439
we're able to do as far as an event goes

1682
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:35,440
because we don't want to run a foul of

1683
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:36,798
them so that determines how you know

1684
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:39,440
like any kind of distribution if

1685
01:01:36,798 --> 01:01:40,480
possible happens that determines whether

1686
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:41,679
we have a

1687
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:43,838
big

1688
01:01:41,679 --> 01:01:46,078
expo that's public or we have a small

1689
01:01:43,838 --> 01:01:49,199
private event like this one

1690
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:50,559
vegas laws right now until they go fully

1691
01:01:49,199 --> 01:01:52,159
recreational

1692
01:01:50,559 --> 01:01:54,480
means that you know we can totally rent

1693
01:01:52,159 --> 01:01:56,719
a house and have a private event but we

1694
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:58,639
can't you know like just invite the

1695
01:01:56,719 --> 01:02:01,118
public to it because uh they had an

1696
01:01:58,639 --> 01:02:02,639
event here recently and uh totally had

1697
01:02:01,119 --> 01:02:04,559
cops show up to it shut down the

1698
01:02:02,639 --> 01:02:06,400
medicating area they weren't quite done

1699
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:08,400
with it yet yeah that was that was a

1700
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:10,160
message you know one of the things also

1701
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:12,318
at the secret cup was because we were

1702
01:02:10,159 --> 01:02:13,838
experts at all this stuff

1703
01:02:12,318 --> 01:02:16,480
you know we might be consuming these

1704
01:02:13,838 --> 01:02:18,960
large amounts but the idea was not to be

1705
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:20,639
like trashy about it it was to be classy

1706
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:22,960
about it and to show that cannabis

1707
01:02:20,639 --> 01:02:25,199
didn't have to be this like

1708
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:27,119
get fucked up and

1709
01:02:25,199 --> 01:02:29,279
be a mess you know like this

1710
01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:31,440
stereotypical negative thing that a lot

1711
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:33,200
of people look at it as that you could

1712
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:35,679
enjoy it and still be like a functioning

1713
01:02:33,199 --> 01:02:37,439
adult and do all kinds of things i mean

1714
01:02:35,679 --> 01:02:39,358
there's a lot of things you can do to

1715
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:41,599
like leave a good impression on the city

1716
01:02:39,358 --> 01:02:42,798
that you're working with um

1717
01:02:41,599 --> 01:02:44,720
one thing that we did in rhode island

1718
01:02:42,798 --> 01:02:46,318
that worked really well is we went to

1719
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:48,078
the city government we told them exactly

1720
01:02:46,318 --> 01:02:49,440
what we were going to do we broke it

1721
01:02:48,079 --> 01:02:51,440
down for them they were completely on

1722
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:52,960
board we got all the permits we needed

1723
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:55,200
and we were able to

1724
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:58,159
on top of all that um

1725
01:02:55,199 --> 01:03:00,318
raise a whole bunch of stuff for the

1726
01:02:58,159 --> 01:03:02,000
homeless so we had people bringing food

1727
01:03:00,318 --> 01:03:03,759
and clothes and we had two truckloads

1728
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:05,358
full of stuff that we dropped off to the

1729
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:07,440
local

1730
01:03:05,358 --> 01:03:10,239
homeless shelter

1731
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:13,358
even with the secret cup i will say like

1732
01:03:10,239 --> 01:03:15,118
as as bad as the situation was with the

1733
01:03:13,358 --> 01:03:17,440
law enforcement my interactions with

1734
01:03:15,119 --> 01:03:19,838
them were all fine you know nobody did

1735
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:22,639
anything to me that was inappropriate

1736
01:03:19,838 --> 01:03:24,159
they definitely put a lot of attention

1737
01:03:22,639 --> 01:03:25,920
on events

1738
01:03:24,159 --> 01:03:27,920
simply because we were smoking cannabis

1739
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:29,358
there and that was the entire reason

1740
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:31,200
they had a problem with our event we

1741
01:03:29,358 --> 01:03:33,199
could have done almost

1742
01:03:31,199 --> 01:03:36,318
the exact same events

1743
01:03:33,199 --> 01:03:38,480
minus the actual cannabis part of them

1744
01:03:36,318 --> 01:03:41,838
and they would have had no problem with

1745
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:43,519
the event the problem was the smoking

1746
01:03:41,838 --> 01:03:46,480
cannabis part

1747
01:03:43,519 --> 01:03:47,679
not even the sales the sales obviously i

1748
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:50,480
could see

1749
01:03:47,679 --> 01:03:52,239
sometimes those being problems you know

1750
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:53,199
or issues

1751
01:03:52,239 --> 01:03:55,439
uh

1752
01:03:53,199 --> 01:03:57,679
that was not the issue the issue was

1753
01:03:55,440 --> 01:04:00,480
smoking cannabis

1754
01:03:57,679 --> 01:04:03,038
and that to me is staggering i can't

1755
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:05,519
believe that that's still a problem

1756
01:04:03,039 --> 01:04:07,920
uh people don't see all the wrestling

1757
01:04:05,519 --> 01:04:10,079
that we have to do with regulations and

1758
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:12,000
laws when we throw one of these events

1759
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:13,680
we have to contract a lawyer and make

1760
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,960
sure this is even possible to do it

1761
01:04:13,679 --> 01:04:16,480
first of all

1762
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:17,679
then it comes to actually putting the

1763
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:19,519
event together

1764
01:04:17,679 --> 01:04:21,118
that means that we have to like raise a

1765
01:04:19,519 --> 01:04:24,079
lot of money and we have to have the

1766
01:04:21,119 --> 01:04:26,720
trust of the community in order to do so

1767
01:04:24,079 --> 01:04:28,559
primarily what pays for these events is

1768
01:04:26,719 --> 01:04:30,719
people that pay for the enhanced

1769
01:04:28,559 --> 01:04:32,480
experience of like you know the the

1770
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:34,239
chance to come to the vip event the

1771
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:36,559
chance gift bag that kind of thing the

1772
01:04:34,239 --> 01:04:38,798
chance to try the entries you know

1773
01:04:36,559 --> 01:04:41,200
they're all paying extra for that stuff

1774
01:04:38,798 --> 01:04:42,960
and we use that money that we raised

1775
01:04:41,199 --> 01:04:44,719
from them to like throw this event we

1776
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:46,159
don't have major sponsors we're a

1777
01:04:44,719 --> 01:04:48,558
grassroots event

1778
01:04:46,159 --> 01:04:50,159
and so as far as manpower goes

1779
01:04:48,559 --> 01:04:52,079
we have a lot of volunteers a lot of

1780
01:04:50,159 --> 01:04:54,399
people that really believe in this they

1781
01:04:52,079 --> 01:04:56,960
might not be able to shell out the 300

1782
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:59,039
necessary to get a ticket but you know

1783
01:04:56,960 --> 01:05:01,280
they are definitely willing to put their

1784
01:04:59,039 --> 01:05:03,520
heart and you know their their efforts

1785
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:06,240
into making sure the event goes well

1786
01:05:03,519 --> 01:05:07,838
like we have people doing like web work

1787
01:05:06,239 --> 01:05:09,759
photography

1788
01:05:07,838 --> 01:05:12,000
people that are cooking people that are

1789
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:13,359
serving people that are cleaning up

1790
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:15,760
people that are running errands and

1791
01:05:13,358 --> 01:05:16,480
putting out any fire that pops up

1792
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:18,960
so

1793
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:20,480
it's a it's a 100 a group effort it's

1794
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:23,760
like you know the family comes together

1795
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:25,838
and then we get it done

1796
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:28,240
the very first secret cup was targeted

1797
01:05:25,838 --> 01:05:30,400
to just kind of be one event

1798
01:05:28,239 --> 01:05:32,000
and then as i wanted to do my own event

1799
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:33,680
in los angeles

1800
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:36,239
other people that had gone to the first

1801
01:05:33,679 --> 01:05:37,759
one wanted to do their own in their own

1802
01:05:36,239 --> 01:05:39,598
cities too

1803
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:40,960
but they were having trouble so dan

1804
01:05:39,599 --> 01:05:42,160
contacted me

1805
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:43,838
brought me on

1806
01:05:42,159 --> 01:05:46,480
so from that point on

1807
01:05:43,838 --> 01:05:48,558
i became involved with throwing all of

1808
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:51,440
the events all over the world

1809
01:05:48,559 --> 01:05:53,839
and ultimately i'm the only person

1810
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:57,599
that was at every secret cup in every

1811
01:05:53,838 --> 01:05:58,480
city and every state and every country

1812
01:05:57,599 --> 01:06:01,039
and that's

1813
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:01,920
actually a very proud accomplishment

1814
01:06:01,039 --> 01:06:04,079
and

1815
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:05,599
one of the best adventures of my life

1816
01:06:04,079 --> 01:06:07,599
everywhere we went

1817
01:06:05,599 --> 01:06:09,119
people would just you know jump in and

1818
01:06:07,599 --> 01:06:12,000
help out like when we had the beast

1819
01:06:09,119 --> 01:06:14,160
coast thing um we ordered hundreds of

1820
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:16,000
lobsters and it just turned out that we

1821
01:06:14,159 --> 01:06:17,920
had a chef there he's now one of my good

1822
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:19,519
friends ben

1823
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:21,440
had a chef there with his knives and

1824
01:06:19,519 --> 01:06:23,358
stuff and he started cooking them for

1825
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:25,280
everybody you know it was that it was

1826
01:06:23,358 --> 01:06:26,798
that level of pitching in all the time

1827
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:28,640
everybody was just

1828
01:06:26,798 --> 01:06:30,960
everywhere we went like we had people

1829
01:06:28,639 --> 01:06:33,759
just step up and help out give us places

1830
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:35,920
to stay drive around work for free

1831
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:37,280
i mean there's so many people

1832
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:39,039
like uh

1833
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:40,880
yeah everyone we did it was the

1834
01:06:39,039 --> 01:06:43,359
community and like we really

1835
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:45,358
what we did was facilitate you know

1836
01:06:43,358 --> 01:06:49,119
everybody coming together that's what we

1837
01:06:45,358 --> 01:06:52,400
did you know we we created a lane and

1838
01:06:49,119 --> 01:06:52,400
everybody else had to pitch into work

1839
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:59,839
so eventually there were little events

1840
01:06:57,599 --> 01:07:02,079
that just focused on money

1841
01:06:59,838 --> 01:07:04,078
vending aspects of the event scene

1842
01:07:02,079 --> 01:07:05,359
and they started popping up every day

1843
01:07:04,079 --> 01:07:07,839
basically

1844
01:07:05,358 --> 01:07:09,440
and there were huge concert-based events

1845
01:07:07,838 --> 01:07:11,599
every month or so

1846
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:14,798
when we were first doing the events

1847
01:07:11,599 --> 01:07:17,280
and this is also true for chalice

1848
01:07:14,798 --> 01:07:19,199
we had the community all coming together

1849
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:20,798
it was really a special thing

1850
01:07:19,199 --> 01:07:22,159
it was a whole movement it was

1851
01:07:20,798 --> 01:07:24,559
incredible

1852
01:07:22,159 --> 01:07:26,719
and we were powerful

1853
01:07:24,559 --> 01:07:28,880
but as these things happen and people

1854
01:07:26,719 --> 01:07:30,078
would go to all these other events all

1855
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:31,519
the time

1856
01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:33,760
we lost that feeling that what we were

1857
01:07:31,519 --> 01:07:35,679
doing was something special

1858
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:37,839
and now most of the other events are

1859
01:07:35,679 --> 01:07:40,798
gone

1860
01:07:37,838 --> 01:07:43,599
in fact there's only a handful of events

1861
01:07:40,798 --> 01:07:45,519
all over the world that i really think

1862
01:07:43,599 --> 01:07:48,160
are worth going to

1863
01:07:45,519 --> 01:07:49,920
uh it seemed that as time went on there

1864
01:07:48,159 --> 01:07:53,838
was less of an interest from the

1865
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:56,559
community um to help and we had always

1866
01:07:53,838 --> 01:07:59,759
relied on the community's help it's one

1867
01:07:56,559 --> 01:08:00,640
thing to find a venue that is making no

1868
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:02,720
money and you're going to give them

1869
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:05,519
thousands of dollars to like use their

1870
01:08:02,719 --> 01:08:07,279
event space for a big ass event like

1871
01:08:05,519 --> 01:08:09,119
that's a little easier it seemed like

1872
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:11,359
over time than finding an intimate space

1873
01:08:09,119 --> 01:08:13,280
for 100 friends to hang out

1874
01:08:11,358 --> 01:08:14,558
you know like airbnb was up on the whole

1875
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:15,599
party thing

1876
01:08:14,559 --> 01:08:16,880
um

1877
01:08:15,599 --> 01:08:18,480
it just got harder and harder to do the

1878
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:20,159
vip stuff to like put out the money

1879
01:08:18,479 --> 01:08:21,759
ahead of time you know i've been to a

1880
01:08:20,158 --> 01:08:23,358
lot of these things since the first one

1881
01:08:21,759 --> 01:08:25,920
in seattle that

1882
01:08:23,359 --> 01:08:27,359
uh i was able to go to

1883
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:29,279
and there was kinks then too you know

1884
01:08:27,359 --> 01:08:32,000
what i mean but it's just

1885
01:08:29,279 --> 01:08:33,359
you know you learn to expect it and it's

1886
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:36,000
you know it's a bunch of stoners putting

1887
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:37,600
together a party you know what i mean so

1888
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:39,359
as we were doing the secret cup we ran

1889
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:41,440
into all these problems

1890
01:08:39,359 --> 01:08:43,279
all these different ways and

1891
01:08:41,439 --> 01:08:45,198
one that was common was legal problems

1892
01:08:43,279 --> 01:08:47,920
with the police from the first event in

1893
01:08:45,198 --> 01:08:49,838
los angeles we had police called in who

1894
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:51,520
showed up in riot gear

1895
01:08:49,838 --> 01:08:53,838
that same year we had issues with them

1896
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:56,000
in san francisco involving our venue and

1897
01:08:53,838 --> 01:08:58,238
we had to switch that last minute that

1898
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:00,079
happened often the worst time was

1899
01:08:58,238 --> 01:09:02,559
probably colorado where it happened

1900
01:09:00,079 --> 01:09:04,399
twice in a week and we had to switch

1901
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:08,239
cities because at one venue i had to

1902
01:09:04,399 --> 01:09:10,639
talk to detectives who had a file on us

1903
01:09:08,238 --> 01:09:13,119
the second event in arizona was the only

1904
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:14,719
event they forced us to cancel

1905
01:09:13,119 --> 01:09:16,640
but in humboldt they showed up to the

1906
01:09:14,719 --> 01:09:18,480
second event with k-9 units and wanted

1907
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:21,199
to arrest everyone they could

1908
01:09:18,479 --> 01:09:23,439
in spain they met me as i was exiting

1909
01:09:21,198 --> 01:09:25,519
the plane with my picture and wanted to

1910
01:09:23,439 --> 01:09:27,678
look through my luggage because all the

1911
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:30,159
trophies and prizes made them suspicious

1912
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:32,560
of me the last event we even did had a

1913
01:09:30,158 --> 01:09:34,639
local cannabis advocacy group take a

1914
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:36,798
public sand against the event

1915
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:38,480
simply for coming to their town

1916
01:09:36,798 --> 01:09:39,920
there were so many times we had to deal

1917
01:09:38,479 --> 01:09:41,678
with problems like these

1918
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:43,359
all of it made it really difficult to

1919
01:09:41,679 --> 01:09:45,119
continue with the events

1920
01:09:43,359 --> 01:09:47,759
and it also led us to having to do

1921
01:09:45,119 --> 01:09:48,640
refunds and cover losses from dropouts

1922
01:09:47,759 --> 01:09:50,640
and

1923
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:52,880
deal with all the negativity surrounding

1924
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:54,640
all those kinds of things

1925
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:56,079
caught a few people trying to cheat and

1926
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:57,840
the support from the community just

1927
01:09:56,079 --> 01:09:59,760
became much less

1928
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:01,440
we weren't making a bunch of money we're

1929
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:04,159
doing these events for the love of

1930
01:10:01,439 --> 01:10:05,678
cannabis and recognizing the really true

1931
01:10:04,158 --> 01:10:07,599
achievement and innovations in the

1932
01:10:05,679 --> 01:10:09,520
cannabis industry when we started to run

1933
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:10,800
into so many problems especially

1934
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:12,560
financially

1935
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:14,159
and people just not appreciating what we

1936
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:17,840
were trying to do

1937
01:10:14,158 --> 01:10:17,839
we decided to stop doing it

1938
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:22,960
to sum it up there's there's two aspects

1939
01:10:21,198 --> 01:10:25,359
of how we inspired people we inspired

1940
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:27,119
people with the spirit of the secret cup

1941
01:10:25,359 --> 01:10:29,279
and we inspired them with the business

1942
01:10:27,119 --> 01:10:30,640
of the secret cup spirit of the secret

1943
01:10:29,279 --> 01:10:31,679
cup was

1944
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:33,119
for me

1945
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:35,440
um it was

1946
01:10:33,119 --> 01:10:37,039
freedom it was like it was almost like

1947
01:10:35,439 --> 01:10:39,439
being a kid again

1948
01:10:37,039 --> 01:10:43,198
you know it was like a summer camp like

1949
01:10:39,439 --> 01:10:46,719
a getaway um like a convention

1950
01:10:43,198 --> 01:10:49,359
for a very niche society of people that

1951
01:10:46,719 --> 01:10:51,439
were making hash for

1952
01:10:49,359 --> 01:10:53,198
um for the community

1953
01:10:51,439 --> 01:10:55,198
that had built fans that were like

1954
01:10:53,198 --> 01:10:57,839
celebrity chefs that were

1955
01:10:55,198 --> 01:11:00,319
you know he had some notoriety so we

1956
01:10:57,840 --> 01:11:02,000
were able to just

1957
01:11:00,319 --> 01:11:04,000
bring all these people together and it

1958
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:05,920
was great you know and that that that

1959
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,800
was the best part of it for me they you

1960
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:08,158
know

1961
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:09,840
you do stuff you do at other events

1962
01:11:08,158 --> 01:11:12,399
listen to music like

1963
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:14,319
uh eat food like all that stuff but you

1964
01:11:12,399 --> 01:11:15,920
know the the love of the cannabis was

1965
01:11:14,319 --> 01:11:16,880
like why everybody was there and that

1966
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:18,960
was great

1967
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:21,279
that was great does that live on

1968
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:23,520
it sure does live on but in

1969
01:11:21,279 --> 01:11:25,519
but not like it was

1970
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:27,360
now that it's been a couple years since

1971
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:28,800
we've done an event

1972
01:11:27,359 --> 01:11:31,359
right around the time we did the

1973
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:33,440
campouts there is a group of people who

1974
01:11:31,359 --> 01:11:35,519
start talking about doing another secret

1975
01:11:33,439 --> 01:11:36,479
cup when i run into people at other

1976
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:38,560
events

1977
01:11:36,479 --> 01:11:40,718
it's very common for them to tell me

1978
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:42,560
about how their company owes some of

1979
01:11:40,719 --> 01:11:43,520
their success to the secret hub in some

1980
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:45,600
way

1981
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:47,920
they got their first booth there

1982
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:49,920
they made some important connection

1983
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:52,239
and the love for the positive

1984
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:53,840
experiences is still strong and that

1985
01:11:52,238 --> 01:11:55,759
makes me super happy for all those

1986
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:57,199
people who are still doing it

1987
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:59,119
and big d

1988
01:11:57,198 --> 01:12:00,639
you made it all possible for me so thank

1989
01:11:59,119 --> 01:12:02,880
you very very much i really appreciate

1990
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:02,880
it yeah

1991
01:12:03,039 --> 01:12:06,319
but yeah the you know there were more

1992
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:08,400
events after this we inspired a lot of

1993
01:12:06,319 --> 01:12:10,319
people to do this on their own in fact

1994
01:12:08,399 --> 01:12:12,479
like one thing that i said every one of

1995
01:12:10,319 --> 01:12:15,198
the cups we had was like look

1996
01:12:12,479 --> 01:12:17,839
we did this we're just like you do this

1997
01:12:15,198 --> 01:12:19,599
too you know they give

1998
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:20,480
your people a place to

1999
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:23,440
buy

2000
01:12:20,479 --> 01:12:25,198
better medicine cheaper you know

2001
01:12:23,439 --> 01:12:28,799
directly from the people that are making

2002
01:12:25,198 --> 01:12:31,519
it build these relationships that will

2003
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:33,679
carry over after legalization after the

2004
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:35,120
chads come in and steal it from you you

2005
01:12:33,679 --> 01:12:37,199
know

2006
01:12:35,119 --> 01:12:39,039
i really did my best to like spread

2007
01:12:37,198 --> 01:12:41,198
those seeds everywhere i went

2008
01:12:39,039 --> 01:12:44,158
and like we didn't even like ask for

2009
01:12:41,198 --> 01:12:44,158
credit from anybody

2010
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:49,039
a lot of times people get

2011
01:12:47,039 --> 01:12:52,000
really upset

2012
01:12:49,039 --> 01:12:53,840
and they start to see into things that

2013
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:55,600
aren't there and

2014
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:56,880
then they start to believe these stories

2015
01:12:55,600 --> 01:13:00,320
that they've kind of

2016
01:12:56,880 --> 01:13:02,000
created for themselves

2017
01:13:00,319 --> 01:13:04,079
like we had people that entered our

2018
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:05,198
event lots of different times and they

2019
01:13:04,079 --> 01:13:08,158
never won

2020
01:13:05,198 --> 01:13:09,839
you know they get really frustrated

2021
01:13:08,158 --> 01:13:10,799
and uh

2022
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:12,800
you know

2023
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:14,719
it's it's hard to accept that you just

2024
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:15,440
aren't doing the best work that's out

2025
01:13:14,719 --> 01:13:17,520
there

2026
01:13:15,439 --> 01:13:19,198
it's a lot easier to say

2027
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:20,880
that there's some sort of conspiracy

2028
01:13:19,198 --> 01:13:21,759
against you and that's why you're not

2029
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:23,359
winning

2030
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:25,760
any time that you do something that

2031
01:13:23,359 --> 01:13:27,439
somebody else isn't doing

2032
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:29,360
even if it's a failure it's still a

2033
01:13:27,439 --> 01:13:30,799
progression because in that failure

2034
01:13:29,359 --> 01:13:32,559
you're going to learn from it and you're

2035
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:34,480
going to learn something that you would

2036
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:36,080
have never learned had you not taken the

2037
01:13:34,479 --> 01:13:38,639
step anyway so

2038
01:13:36,079 --> 01:13:40,559
so anything that's a progression towards

2039
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:43,920
what something hasn't been done before

2040
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:45,920
in my mind is is an advancement towards

2041
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:47,359
uh towards something better even if it's

2042
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:49,920
not something that you initially

2043
01:13:47,359 --> 01:13:52,880
recognize is better

2044
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:56,560
we were operating in a great area

2045
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:58,560
between medical and recreational

2046
01:13:56,560 --> 01:14:01,440
they passed these laws and they were not

2047
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:03,600
very specific so you kind of had blanket

2048
01:14:01,439 --> 01:14:05,919
protection in order to put one of these

2049
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:07,760
on like a lot of times like the local

2050
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:09,840
authorities didn't even want to

2051
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:11,600
bother with us you know we put this

2052
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:13,920
together with our friends

2053
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:15,440
you know we made a movement that

2054
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:17,840
attracted people from all over the

2055
01:14:15,439 --> 01:14:20,000
country and all over the world that

2056
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:22,560
built up the mythos of this subculture

2057
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:24,079
to the point where it entered popular

2058
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:25,120
culture

2059
01:14:24,079 --> 01:14:27,760
um

2060
01:14:25,119 --> 01:14:29,359
but at the the end of the day

2061
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:32,719
we didn't have the resources to go on

2062
01:14:29,359 --> 01:14:32,719
anymore so we had to stop

2063
01:14:35,039 --> 01:14:38,960
you know the the movement still goes on

2064
01:14:37,359 --> 01:14:40,960
there are still other events that are

2065
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:43,119
kind of doing similar things to what we

2066
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:45,198
were doing and and some of the people

2067
01:14:43,119 --> 01:14:46,640
that used to attend our events are

2068
01:14:45,198 --> 01:14:50,158
headlining those

2069
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:53,640
uh other events in other places but

2070
01:14:50,158 --> 01:14:53,639
it's not the same

2071
01:14:56,158 --> 01:14:59,519
i think this is one of the

2072
01:14:57,840 --> 01:15:02,400
best events out there

2073
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:04,159
i really think that you know

2074
01:15:02,399 --> 01:15:05,920
we would love to to

2075
01:15:04,158 --> 01:15:07,839
to have more people that are purists and

2076
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:10,239
and people like us like-minded people

2077
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:11,440
get involved all over as as we're

2078
01:15:10,238 --> 01:15:12,879
opening up the doors of the united

2079
01:15:11,439 --> 01:15:14,879
states from our

2080
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:16,719
legal marijuana i think it's also going

2081
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:18,480
to open up the doors for more people to

2082
01:15:16,719 --> 01:15:20,480
become family in the secret cup so yeah

2083
01:15:18,479 --> 01:15:21,919
i would recommend it i would uh love to

2084
01:15:20,479 --> 01:15:23,759
see this family grow

2085
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:25,840
the best part about the secret cup is

2086
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:29,440
how it brings all the like-minded

2087
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:31,920
individuals together uh kind of in a

2088
01:15:29,439 --> 01:15:33,678
form of unity and it's not so much about

2089
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:35,840
the commercialization

2090
01:15:33,679 --> 01:15:37,279
it's more about the art it's more about

2091
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:39,039
the product

2092
01:15:37,279 --> 01:15:41,039
it's more about

2093
01:15:39,039 --> 01:15:41,920
the sense of community

2094
01:15:41,039 --> 01:15:44,238
you know everybody's going to have a

2095
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:46,880
good time no matter what because

2096
01:15:44,238 --> 01:15:48,799
we're all here together you know

2097
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:50,159
so all that's

2098
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:52,159
all that small stuff doesn't really

2099
01:15:50,158 --> 01:15:53,759
matter we all we all made it here we all

2100
01:15:52,158 --> 01:15:55,439
we're all having a good time

2101
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:57,760
you know it could be stressful because

2102
01:15:55,439 --> 01:15:59,039
of the logistics side of things but

2103
01:15:57,760 --> 01:16:01,360
in the end it

2104
01:15:59,039 --> 01:16:03,198
it always comes together i just i love

2105
01:16:01,359 --> 01:16:06,479
everybody gathering

2106
01:16:03,198 --> 01:16:08,000
and really man this this shit's like

2107
01:16:06,479 --> 01:16:10,158
it's like being in some magical

2108
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:12,000
wonderland that people just don't i mean

2109
01:16:10,158 --> 01:16:13,519
when my friends and my folks hear about

2110
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,960
how what we're how we're getting down

2111
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:17,840
out here they just can't believe it you

2112
01:16:14,960 --> 01:16:19,439
know it's nuts they see the videos it's

2113
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:20,960
it's really cool it's a blessing to be a

2114
01:16:19,439 --> 01:16:22,960
part of all of this and i can only

2115
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:24,880
relate it to when i was younger i

2116
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:26,399
thought man if we could only

2117
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:28,079
live in the times of when the hippies

2118
01:16:26,399 --> 01:16:30,158
were doing you know the 60s the 70s the

2119
01:16:28,079 --> 01:16:32,640
woodstock days how crazy that must have

2120
01:16:30,158 --> 01:16:35,439
been like where are we i think we're in

2121
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:38,000
that like blip of of our 60s 70s and

2122
01:16:35,439 --> 01:16:39,839
it's just cool to be a part of this have

2123
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:42,158
so many of the homies get down that we

2124
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:43,440
do get down with and uh you already know

2125
01:16:42,158 --> 01:16:46,158
it's just it's just the beginning it's

2126
01:16:43,439 --> 01:16:47,439
gonna keep going secret cup to infinity

2127
01:16:46,158 --> 01:16:49,439
and beyond

2128
01:16:47,439 --> 01:16:50,879
yeah i mean dude it just it erupted into

2129
01:16:49,439 --> 01:16:53,279
its own thing

2130
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:56,400
the cannabis scene from place to place

2131
01:16:53,279 --> 01:16:59,439
is unique and wonderful they have their

2132
01:16:56,399 --> 01:17:01,519
own genetics they have their own heroes

2133
01:16:59,439 --> 01:17:03,198
their own

2134
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:05,280
soldiers

2135
01:17:03,198 --> 01:17:07,599
they have their activists

2136
01:17:05,279 --> 01:17:08,559
there are really wonderful things going

2137
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:11,440
on

2138
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:13,120
all over the country all over the world

2139
01:17:11,439 --> 01:17:15,279
and when you go to these other places

2140
01:17:13,119 --> 01:17:17,519
and you start to learn these stories and

2141
01:17:15,279 --> 01:17:19,279
part of the story is the culture of the

2142
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:23,440
place that you're in and part of the

2143
01:17:19,279 --> 01:17:26,319
story is the cannabis history that

2144
01:17:23,439 --> 01:17:28,319
is from this location and surrounding

2145
01:17:26,319 --> 01:17:32,158
all of these kind of

2146
01:17:28,319 --> 01:17:35,119
genetics and these different growers and

2147
01:17:32,158 --> 01:17:37,279
um hashmakers

2148
01:17:35,119 --> 01:17:38,479
all of that stuff is

2149
01:17:37,279 --> 01:17:40,719
so rich

2150
01:17:38,479 --> 01:17:42,959
and for me as a cannabis enthusiast a

2151
01:17:40,719 --> 01:17:44,640
true person that loved cannabis like

2152
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:46,800
going to these places and hearing these

2153
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:49,440
stories and meeting these people

2154
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:51,279
it was awesome for me and

2155
01:17:49,439 --> 01:17:53,119
just as cool as it was for them to be a

2156
01:17:51,279 --> 01:17:54,719
part of our event it was cool for me to

2157
01:17:53,119 --> 01:17:57,039
be a part of their history and their

2158
01:17:54,719 --> 01:17:59,279
culture one thing i want to communicate

2159
01:17:57,039 --> 01:18:00,079
is like the best thing about it all for

2160
01:17:59,279 --> 01:18:02,639
me

2161
01:18:00,079 --> 01:18:04,719
um wasn't the the cannabis it was the

2162
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:06,400
freedom it was like traveling to a

2163
01:18:04,719 --> 01:18:09,039
different city

2164
01:18:06,399 --> 01:18:12,319
and people there you know greeting us

2165
01:18:09,039 --> 01:18:13,920
warmly and giving us gifts and feeding

2166
01:18:12,319 --> 01:18:16,079
us and taking to their us to their

2167
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:18,640
favorite spots and showing us their

2168
01:18:16,079 --> 01:18:20,238
zones like only a local could

2169
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:22,480
local people that would hear that you're

2170
01:18:20,238 --> 01:18:24,879
coming out and they would want to take

2171
01:18:22,479 --> 01:18:27,919
us to their grow or they would want to

2172
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:29,440
take us to some really local special

2173
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:31,119
food spot and

2174
01:18:29,439 --> 01:18:32,799
sometimes it had nothing to do with

2175
01:18:31,119 --> 01:18:35,760
cannabis they just wanted to show us the

2176
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:38,000
history of the town and i loved it it

2177
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:40,480
was so wonderful i

2178
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:42,158
enjoyed that probably the best out of

2179
01:18:40,479 --> 01:18:44,319
all the things that we did

2180
01:18:42,158 --> 01:18:46,960

2181
01:18:44,319 --> 01:18:48,719

2183
01:18:48,719 --> 01:18:52,719

2184
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:54,399
do we want to spread the movement you

2185

really believe in uh the medical value

2189
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:06,319
to what we do here it's uh pretty

2190
01:19:04,238 --> 01:19:09,039
commonly known that having friends and

2191
01:19:06,319 --> 01:19:11,679
having a good social life is healing for

2192
01:19:09,039 --> 01:19:13,519
people and uh they're constantly trying

2193
01:19:11,679 --> 01:19:15,119
to keep us away from each other they

2194
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:17,199
don't want us to be friends i don't know

2195
01:19:15,119 --> 01:19:18,158
what it's about but we're all here

2196
01:19:17,198 --> 01:19:20,238
together

2197
01:19:18,158 --> 01:19:22,879
and we're forming a family and they're

2198
01:19:20,238 --> 01:19:25,359
not gonna be able to keep us apart

2199
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:27,920
so thank you guys all for being out here

2200
01:19:25,359 --> 01:19:29,679
and uh i hope you had a great time when

2201
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:31,279
we first did the events

2202
01:19:29,679 --> 01:19:32,158
you know people were very skeptical

2203
01:19:31,279 --> 01:19:34,479
about

2204
01:19:32,158 --> 01:19:36,559
our ability to do them and and the whole

2205
01:19:34,479 --> 01:19:37,919
thing and they would have a lot to say

2206
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:39,440
and then as we were doing them and

2207
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:40,800
people were having these amazing

2208
01:19:39,439 --> 01:19:43,678
wonderful times and there were these

2209
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:46,719
colossal successes

2210
01:19:43,679 --> 01:19:49,679
people wanted to get on board and become

2211
01:19:46,719 --> 01:19:51,600
supporters and so we had

2212
01:19:49,679 --> 01:19:53,279
some people kind of just had play on our

2213
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:54,800
name you know they started their own

2214
01:19:53,279 --> 01:19:56,880
event and it had

2215
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:58,880
a similar name to our event

2216
01:19:56,880 --> 01:20:01,039
but that ultimately

2217
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:03,440
resulted in people just straight up

2218
01:20:01,039 --> 01:20:05,760
stealing our name there were multiple

2219
01:20:03,439 --> 01:20:08,319
events in other countries

2220
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:11,360
that were just called the secret cup

2221
01:20:08,319 --> 01:20:13,519
that we had no affiliation with at all

2222
01:20:11,359 --> 01:20:15,920
i guess that's flattering and kind of

2223
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:18,400
now where i'm standing i'm ready to give

2224
01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:20,079
the the title of seeker cup to the

2225
01:20:18,399 --> 01:20:21,839
to the world and everyone can go throw

2226
01:20:20,079 --> 01:20:22,800
their own secret cups and

2227
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:24,319
you know

2228
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:26,159
i wish everyone

2229
01:20:24,319 --> 01:20:27,679
all the success and all the happy times

2230
01:20:26,158 --> 01:20:29,679
that we had

2231
01:20:27,679 --> 01:20:32,000
okay let's get to it

2232
01:20:29,679 --> 01:20:33,840
like we were really lucky that we got to

2233
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:35,840
do it in the right time and we did it in

2234
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:36,639
the right time and

2235
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:37,679
we

2236
01:20:36,639 --> 01:20:39,199
a lot of people made a lot of

2237
01:20:37,679 --> 01:20:40,639
connections and we all made a lot of

2238
01:20:39,198 --> 01:20:42,000
memories and we all made a lot of

2239
01:20:40,639 --> 01:20:44,639
friendships

2240
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:47,039
but the thing we did could only happen

2241
01:20:44,639 --> 01:20:50,319
in the time period that it happened

2242
01:20:47,039 --> 01:20:50,319
and i'm glad we made it happen

2243
