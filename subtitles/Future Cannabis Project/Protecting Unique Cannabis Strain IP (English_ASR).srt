1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,899
how do you protect your IP and and I

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:05,790
think that's the pieces that you hold it

3
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:07,500
right now in for them Philo's doesn't

4
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:09,089
take your living material what they're

5
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,669
doing is they take a material that's in

6
00:00:09,089 --> 00:00:13,530
sap form basically cellular level they

7
00:00:11,669 --> 00:00:16,439
can't take it and utilize it any form

8
00:00:13,529 --> 00:00:18,118
other than map it on a galaxy what I did

9
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:20,400
with the galaxy is I mapped a tremendous

10
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:23,490
number of cultivars because I was

11
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:25,439
worried about losing the ability to run

12
00:00:23,489 --> 00:00:27,479
them if someone had a broad spectrum

13
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,579
patent so these broad utility patents

14
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,320
are pretty fucking big and they allow

15
00:00:29,579 --> 00:00:33,659
them to gather up many varieties so I

16
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:37,558
said listen if I can predate your work

17
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:39,449
in a marked form you can't fuck me so I

18
00:00:37,558 --> 00:00:41,488
did all this work and a lot of it was to

19
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:42,960
that a lot of the farmers were afraid of

20
00:00:41,488 --> 00:00:44,519
this tech but I said my mom's a

21
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,049
scientist so I'm like no no no this shit

22
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,239
isn't this isn't they're going to steal

23
00:00:46,049 --> 00:00:50,099
it they're gonna use your data but

24
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:51,779
they're not gonna take your material and

25
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,760
what it does it starts to allow us to

26
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:56,039
repeat pieces I use the galaxy to prove

27
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:57,960
varietals so when I build a new bed

28
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:59,939
before we release a piece I say just

29
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,649
send it in for mapping so we make sure

30
00:00:59,939 --> 00:01:03,119
that the stuff that we're sending did

31
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:05,368
you get it from the right mom because

32
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:07,530
this shit doesn't look the same map it

33
00:01:05,368 --> 00:01:09,868
and I map it it lets me come back but it

34
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:11,368
sets precedent so it says that you're

35
00:01:09,868 --> 00:01:14,909
the first person to put this up on a

36
00:01:11,368 --> 00:01:16,469
galaxy it states a genetic mark and then

37
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:18,930
what you can do is you're working with

38
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:21,810
laboratories like no these are micro

39
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:23,549
alarm then you would work on a contract

40
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:26,640
with them with all like all laboratories

41
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:27,659
where it's secure and so you take that

42
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,368
piece you don't have to put in

43
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:31,829
propagation you could work with them

44
00:01:29,368 --> 00:01:33,359
directly and never have me touch it see

45
00:01:31,828 --> 00:01:34,618
I don't have to touch your product to go

46
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:36,629
work with my other end of the company

47
00:01:34,618 --> 00:01:40,379
and so what it does it allows you to

48
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:43,259
scrub protect and then hold in vitro if

49
00:01:40,379 --> 00:01:45,629
you wanted in vitro hold but though most

50
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:47,790
of it is the mapping of that genetic

51
00:01:45,629 --> 00:01:49,228
material allows you to say what you're

52
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:50,820
working because people once it gets out

53
00:01:49,228 --> 00:01:53,340
in the world that less one it someone's

54
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:55,709
gonna s want it but s1 never comes back

55
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:56,790
as the same source material and then

56
00:01:55,709 --> 00:01:58,259
that's what we're doing it's trying to

57
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:00,420
build these pieces so we can set up

58
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:02,489
these legal contracts that say this is

59
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:04,590
the material we work with and as long as

60
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:07,408
it gives you a head start on the market

61
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:08,909
you run and typically s ones don't come

62
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:10,349
off the same because you're you're

63
00:02:08,909 --> 00:02:13,310
having to go through the Janek selection

64
00:02:10,348 --> 00:02:16,909
process no

65
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:20,420
there there there has been no its

66
00:02:16,909 --> 00:02:22,729
quality so the Biggers down s1 is where

67
00:02:20,419 --> 00:02:25,369
I take I take a plant and I self it into

68
00:02:22,729 --> 00:02:28,369
itself and so if I wanted to do self

69
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:31,610
incorrectly I could take a plant of a

70
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:33,890
dissimilar genomic form and I could FEM

71
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:37,130
it and go into it so I'm going female to

72
00:02:33,889 --> 00:02:40,129
female but because I'm not going keV -

73
00:02:37,129 --> 00:02:42,500
keV I'm going have the Ken I'm not

74
00:02:40,129 --> 00:02:45,560
having that vigor decrease as soon as I

75
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:47,360
start to Umbria much my overall vigour

76
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:49,849
levels decline dramatically that's the

77
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,950
same problem with the Royals so every

78
00:02:49,849 --> 00:02:53,599
now and then you'll have a huge pop up

79
00:02:51,949 --> 00:02:54,768
that comes off incredible but most of

80
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,269
the time you get some really freaky

81
00:02:54,769 --> 00:02:58,370
anomalies that you need to get rid of

82
00:02:56,269 --> 00:03:00,379
and so most of the stuff you're looking

83
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:02,840
at in genex today is someone got to

84
00:03:00,379 --> 00:03:04,340
cutting someone's self tit they said

85
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,979
look I have all these other cuts this is

86
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:10,459
my unique cut but it's never the same as

87
00:03:06,979 --> 00:03:12,289
the parental the p1 and so the marking

88
00:03:10,459 --> 00:03:14,060
situation allows you to begin it because

89
00:03:12,289 --> 00:03:15,620
none of us can patent this necessarily

90
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:17,870
because you can't just patent a plant

91
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:19,120
you've to patent a line and to patent a

92
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:21,049
line you have to have a 25%

93
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:26,629
reproducibility that's at a genetic

94
00:03:21,049 --> 00:03:27,680
level 25% that's what though you can you

95
00:03:26,629 --> 00:03:30,620
should be able to increase all of these

96
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:33,200
processes but 25% in normal agriculture

97
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:35,000
is patentable and so in normal

98
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:37,669
agriculture nothing to do with cannabis

99
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,979
just regular AG that's considered to

100
00:03:37,669 --> 00:03:43,518
where you are genetically stable so

101
00:03:39,979 --> 00:03:45,199
we're 25% of them are identical and I

102
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,359
mean identical right now you you're

103
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:49,399
similar and most of this poly high

104
00:03:47,359 --> 00:03:52,010
because you guys sift you pop it out and

105
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:53,959
you're like I did a thousand I got 900

106
00:03:52,009 --> 00:03:56,030
different looking plants and I got two

107
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:58,759
or three that looked the same right

108
00:03:56,030 --> 00:04:01,849
that's poly hybrid ISM too many parental

109
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:03,108
lines coming into one one swirl and so I

110
00:04:01,849 --> 00:04:04,879
think like for you guys

111
00:04:03,109 --> 00:04:06,409
what you do is you take these varieties

112
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:08,329
you have and if you're gonna put

113
00:04:06,409 --> 00:04:10,609
together your own micro problem Atari

114
00:04:08,329 --> 00:04:12,439
and get your own cryo scientists then

115
00:04:10,609 --> 00:04:14,840
just follow the advice where you're

116
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:16,639
gonna take it meristem cleanse it so

117
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:18,379
that you have no viral contamination on

118
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,379
it that you because it's a lot of these

119
00:04:18,379 --> 00:04:22,579
lines have them you just don't see it

120
00:04:20,379 --> 00:04:26,029
scrub it up so that it never comes out

121
00:04:22,579 --> 00:04:27,060
on you hold it in cryo hold it in a bio

122
00:04:26,029 --> 00:04:28,709
form someplace

123
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:31,649
Celso you have a triple redundancy I

124
00:04:28,709 --> 00:04:34,589
wanted in cryo I wanted in vitro I

125
00:04:31,649 --> 00:04:36,269
wanted it in biologics so that way I

126
00:04:34,589 --> 00:04:39,089
have it in three different locations

127
00:04:36,269 --> 00:04:40,620
three different forms of hold now you

128
00:04:39,089 --> 00:04:41,819
start to be able to have the ability

129
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:44,730
where if any one of those operations

130
00:04:41,819 --> 00:04:47,250
fails something happens catastrophe

131
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:49,139
occurs for us I used to say raid because

132
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:51,269
I lost rivers and other banks to raids

133
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:53,189
through all the hot operations good I've

134
00:04:51,269 --> 00:04:54,449
been doing this a long time so for all

135
00:04:53,189 --> 00:04:57,089
the years we were in the in the in the

136
00:04:54,449 --> 00:04:59,219
markets prior armed robberies and raids

137
00:04:57,089 --> 00:05:01,439
knocked out multiple libraries of shit

138
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:04,889
that I can never replace I can never

139
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:06,569
replace any of that stock and so for me

140
00:05:04,889 --> 00:05:08,040
when people tell me hey we can hold it

141
00:05:06,569 --> 00:05:09,870
in this form I'm like I want it held in

142
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:12,110
three different forms at three different

143
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:15,300
locations by three different people and

144
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:16,590
I need three that I trust and now we're

145
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:18,180
talking the hard part the three that you

146
00:05:16,589 --> 00:05:20,009
trust if you guys can do your own

147
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:22,650
banking then you don't have to worry

148
00:05:20,009 --> 00:05:24,990
about it but you start to use the galaxy

149
00:05:22,649 --> 00:05:27,779
to mark to map your situation to say

150
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:29,819
look this is my specific piece and then

151
00:05:27,779 --> 00:05:31,918
you can license it and then you could

152
00:05:29,819 --> 00:05:33,478
always go prove that if someone utilized

153
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:35,219
that you can do a cease-and-desist on

154
00:05:33,478 --> 00:05:37,620
that product because you have control

155
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:39,840
and I learned that from Michael buffer

156
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:41,550
so Michael buffer the guy that does

157
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:43,949
let's get ready to rumble do you know

158
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:46,800
how much that's worth half a billion

159
00:05:43,949 --> 00:05:49,228
dollars that that little phrase is a

160
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,850
half a billion dollar empire and the

161
00:05:49,228 --> 00:05:52,620
reason why it's a half a billion dollars

162
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:54,450
is because he puts lawyers on your ass

163
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:57,300
if you use it any context if he doesn't

164
00:05:54,449 --> 00:06:00,870
license it he goes at you aggressively

165
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:03,180
and so I realized from him that his

166
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:05,160
methodology is it's very easy to use it

167
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:06,660
but he finds out you're using it he's

168
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,850
going at you a cease-and-desist just

169
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:11,130
like hit man glass got nailed for the

170
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:12,689
Starbucks so lo and behold an 800

171
00:06:11,129 --> 00:06:14,939
thousand dollar fine later they're not

172
00:06:12,689 --> 00:06:16,709
doing Starbucks anymore you'd have the

173
00:06:14,939 --> 00:06:18,719
ability to do the same situation and

174
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:21,269
then for us what we're working with is

175
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,340
some individuals have some of the other

176
00:06:21,269 --> 00:06:25,769
large indoor facilities that we talked

177
00:06:23,339 --> 00:06:28,079
to that I know say hey would you be able

178
00:06:25,769 --> 00:06:30,149
to do my own genetics and then hold them

179
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:31,829
in in vitro and then release them back

180
00:06:30,149 --> 00:06:33,299
to us through micro because you can give

181
00:06:31,829 --> 00:06:35,519
it to us cheaper than we can produce in

182
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:37,288
ourselves with the new facility and I

183
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:40,139
said totally because we just signed the

184
00:06:37,288 --> 00:06:40,839
same contracts and and then it puts me

185
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:43,599
in a position

186
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:46,349
of getting watching language on tape

187
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,350
I'll get ripped
