1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,040
it was just like with nitro pack right

2
00:00:01,949 --> 00:00:07,108
everybody says nitro pack I I get a guy

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,550
flying to talk to me and so because

4
00:00:07,108 --> 00:00:10,740
Humble Connie's Big Timber region

5
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:12,210
there's a company called Simpson timber

6
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,669
their massive timber company a

7
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,560
multi-state timber company so the owner

8
00:00:14,669 --> 00:00:18,868
that the timber company comes to me to

9
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:20,608
get cannabis info so that he can

10
00:00:18,868 --> 00:00:23,359
understand what's house cannabis gonna

11
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:25,769
affect my world so I chop it up with him

12
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:27,810
and then he brings in people from other

13
00:00:25,768 --> 00:00:30,778
industries to talk to me but he brought

14
00:00:27,809 --> 00:00:33,058
a guy in that dries all the lumber for

15
00:00:30,778 --> 00:00:35,308
like Pacific lumber in Louisiana Pacific

16
00:00:33,058 --> 00:00:37,349
and I'm talking with with talking lumber

17
00:00:35,308 --> 00:00:39,808
fire us worth the lump but he does like

18
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:41,010
Purina dog food and so we're having a

19
00:00:39,808 --> 00:00:42,269
conversation he goes when's the last

20
00:00:41,009 --> 00:00:44,849
time you opened a bag of dog food and

21
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:47,070
saw mold on it and I said never and he

22
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:49,140
goes that's because we dry it you see

23
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:50,429
any nitrogen in that shit and I was like

24
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:50,759
no when he goes because you don't need

25
00:00:50,429 --> 00:00:52,799
it

26
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:54,960
he said nitrogen is for people who don't

27
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:57,448
know how to stabilize product he said

28
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,719
from professional dryers from people who

29
00:00:57,448 --> 00:01:03,570
are drying global level drying as an

30
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,460
industry you're not drying it right you

31
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:07,290
said it's stabilization bringing the

32
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:09,599
levels down and for me doing outdoor

33
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,060
biologicals has a higher hold ability so

34
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:14,250
when I do pro bio pot outside I have

35
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:16,969
less of an oxidization degradation than

36
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:20,009
I do if I run chemical so if you're

37
00:01:16,969 --> 00:01:22,709
doing outdoor organics it seems to hold

38
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:24,900
longer as a comparative where I get less

39
00:01:22,709 --> 00:01:27,329
oxidization and so if a variety is

40
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,618
moving like crazy not as important but

41
00:01:27,329 --> 00:01:29,938
if you got to sit on that stuff for a

42
00:01:28,618 --> 00:01:32,640
minute and it starts to gold at all

43
00:01:29,938 --> 00:01:34,019
you're dropping dollar value and so

44
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,969
people say well your nitro packet

45
00:01:34,019 --> 00:01:37,769
buttman nitro packing adds complexity

46
00:01:35,969 --> 00:01:40,259
and money and as soon as you crack it

47
00:01:37,769 --> 00:01:42,118
the degradation after nitro is fast and

48
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:43,859
so I'm talking to this guy that owns

49
00:01:42,118 --> 00:01:45,659
this massive company from the East Coast

50
00:01:43,859 --> 00:01:47,188
the Carolinas and so he flies out to

51
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:50,040
chop it up because he and I were trying

52
00:01:47,188 --> 00:01:52,500
to come up with modular drying chambers

53
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,689
that we can set it farms in the hills so

54
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,670
that the farmer could control the drying

55
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:58,319
of the product and then people use the

56
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:01,200
word curing the curing is actually a

57
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:02,968
process and it's not just holding it

58
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,159
it's actually a process of holding at a

59
00:02:02,968 --> 00:02:07,500
specific temperature and dropping the

60
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:09,868
humidity by 15 points over a multi-month

61
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,580
period and so with that multi-month

62
00:02:09,868 --> 00:02:14,069
period on a computer Grady

63
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:17,880
is what allows this product to actually

64
00:02:14,069 --> 00:02:19,409
stabilize and sustain for time and so

65
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:22,319
the you would be able to take the

66
00:02:19,409 --> 00:02:24,180
product rough bucket put it into your

67
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,909
drying chambers we were looking at

68
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:28,170
solarization so that we didn't have to

69
00:02:26,909 --> 00:02:29,849
you because he can't use Jenny's up in

70
00:02:28,169 --> 00:02:31,709
the hill a lot of these farms don't have

71
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:34,049
grid power and so I said look if we

72
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:36,270
could come up with containers that were

73
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:38,730
sealed that were climactically stable

74
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:40,830
and then we could have solarization now

75
00:02:38,729 --> 00:02:42,689
we could deliver them the farmer could

76
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:44,070
now use this to hold the product because

77
00:02:42,689 --> 00:02:45,300
I worried about the farm is sending

78
00:02:44,069 --> 00:02:47,069
their product all the people to work

79
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:48,750
with so you had a lot of these giant

80
00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:50,159
manufacturing facilities that are like

81
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:51,689
hey give us your product and we'll do it

82
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:53,789
and I'm like these guys can't even roll

83
00:02:51,689 --> 00:02:55,349
weed like I'm straight up they came in

84
00:02:53,789 --> 00:02:57,449
roll weed and I'm like you and it

85
00:02:55,349 --> 00:02:59,189
doesn't define you but it sure gives me

86
00:02:57,449 --> 00:03:01,310
a pretty goddamn good clue of how much

87
00:02:59,189 --> 00:03:04,259
pot you've touched and so when you can't

88
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:05,640
handle it at the consumption level how

89
00:03:04,259 --> 00:03:07,620
are you supposed to handle it at the

90
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:10,379
production level and so I'm like I

91
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:12,750
wouldn't let you do it and so I realized

92
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:15,329
there was a need for farmers to have an

93
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:17,669
ability to hold their varietals and hand

94
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:20,190
themselves but not use antiquated

95
00:03:17,669 --> 00:03:21,329
technology and then to have HEPA filter

96
00:03:20,189 --> 00:03:23,639
scrubbers so that you didn't have

97
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:25,950
pathogenic issues while you're holding

98
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:27,719
it and then once the facility had the

99
00:03:25,949 --> 00:03:30,238
ability to do your processing because an

100
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:33,419
humble most of the farms are off-site

101
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:35,129
processing how do you take the product

102
00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:36,329
now and then you just put it on they

103
00:03:35,129 --> 00:03:37,319
wanted to do buildings and I said it

104
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:39,750
won't work you'll have to move it too

105
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:41,699
many times put it into a container that

106
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:43,800
they can then haul onto the back of a

107
00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:45,810
truck and bring the truck back down the

108
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:48,900
hill drop the container at the facility

109
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:49,920
it sits in Lots under metal tag like you

110
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:52,590
do with you when you're shipping

111
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:53,639
overseas and that way it's been sealed

112
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:56,310
that's been sealed

113
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:57,719
it's Solarize you have digital gauges on

114
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:59,009
the outside that you can check the

115
00:03:57,719 --> 00:04:01,199
maintenance so you know the climactic

116
00:03:59,009 --> 00:04:03,179
situation inside this way when they're

117
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:04,949
ready to do the actual processing of it

118
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:06,480
from that point forward they can then

119
00:04:04,949 --> 00:04:09,709
crack it and what you have is really

120
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:12,689
high quality product ready to use and

121
00:04:09,709 --> 00:04:14,099
that is where we were working on it but

122
00:04:12,689 --> 00:04:15,750
it's trying to get the price points

123
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:18,600
right because as the margins keep

124
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:20,459
dropping in cannabis everybody who came

125
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,379
into cannabis had a price point of it's

126
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:23,939
going to be 2,000 a pound then the next

127
00:04:22,379 --> 00:04:24,689
group comes in it's going to be 1,400 a

128
00:04:23,939 --> 00:04:26,370
pound

129
00:04:24,689 --> 00:04:27,810
and then and and now these guys are like

130
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:29,069
look I told you I was gonna give you 14

131
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:31,110
for your outdoor and I need to give you

132
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:33,870
seven and so all of a sudden I'm like

133
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:35,430
wait a minute if you have to drop the

134
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:37,079
number by half you guys are gonna go out

135
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:38,939
of business in a minute and I wouldn't

136
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:40,289
want to give you any of my weed I don't

137
00:04:38,939 --> 00:04:40,949
want you to touch any of my products if

138
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:42,840
you're going to go out of business

139
00:04:40,949 --> 00:04:45,149
because what's my product gonna go and

140
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:46,859
so a lot of this is I'm working on all

141
00:04:45,149 --> 00:04:49,409
this R&amp;D with all these companies to

142
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:52,080
mess around but it's a matter of getting

143
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:54,300
some stabilization to occur in the

144
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:55,589
industry so that you have companies

145
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:57,660
they're actually going to be here in a

146
00:04:55,589 --> 00:04:59,209
year because half these cats I see how

147
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:01,560
gonna be here in two months and

148
00:04:59,209 --> 00:05:03,539
especially with legalization coming in

149
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:05,370
we're like careful State come in they're

150
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:07,650
gonna scrub you right out and so the

151
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:09,300
problem is on these processing

152
00:05:07,649 --> 00:05:11,009
facilities I think if all that materials

153
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:12,960
there and they come in they're not going

154
00:05:11,009 --> 00:05:14,219
to shut you down and let you move the

155
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:17,549
product they're gonna shut you down and

156
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:18,690
seize the product and so that's

157
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:20,370
something I couldn't recommend to a

158
00:05:18,689 --> 00:05:21,420
farmer because otherwise what you're

159
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:24,000
doing is you Center them down the road

160
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:26,310
to get screwed and it's it's a lot of

161
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,319
this stuff on on how do you get the

162
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:30,360
end-user to be able to get those price

163
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:31,889
points to where cured cannabis would be

164
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:36,270
at these upper echelon whether it's

165
00:05:31,889 --> 00:05:37,979
indoor or outdoor bio or or chemical all

166
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:39,449
of them can deliver ultra high quality

167
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:40,710
product there's no question we can get

168
00:05:39,449 --> 00:05:43,680
high quality for many different

169
00:05:40,709 --> 00:05:46,709
methodologies but it's all the secondary

170
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:49,110
production how was it processed and and

171
00:05:46,709 --> 00:05:50,519
how did you stabilize it those are some

172
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:51,840
of the next issues that you deal with

173
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:53,099
and that's not part of what I'm working

174
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:54,418
with is just what I'm working with with

175
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:57,000
companies that are coming in saying hey

176
00:05:54,418 --> 00:05:58,709
can you help us mess with this and try

177
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,449
to figure out what do we do because I

178
00:05:58,709 --> 00:06:04,259
need the farmers that I'm involved with

179
00:06:00,449 --> 00:06:07,168
to be able to have the crop grow it out

180
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:09,860
have a known destination but have an

181
00:06:07,168 --> 00:06:13,769
ability to hold it on their own property

182
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:14,879
safely until it gets trucked out yes

183
00:06:13,769 --> 00:06:16,349
until the disturbed get rid of it

184
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:18,180
because like I said all these guys are

185
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:19,950
popping up and popping out and I watched

186
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:21,300
a couple distributors come through last

187
00:06:19,949 --> 00:06:22,259
year when someone's the company was

188
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:24,870
doing this one I want to mention their

189
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:27,810
name man they ripped the number of

190
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:30,509
people off and I mean it was nutty where

191
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:31,560
the rivers of cats got robbed and then

192
00:06:30,509 --> 00:06:32,819
all these cats come to me and they're

193
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,720
like what's my recourse and I'm like

194
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:34,889
well you don't really have a legal

195
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,060
recourse because they've already dumped

196
00:06:34,889 --> 00:06:37,099
the company in there out here you want

197
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:39,319
recourse you have his old

198
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:40,670
recourse and I can't recommend that

199
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:44,300
really unless we're whispering in your

200
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:46,250
ear so it's problematic because most

201
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:48,889
people aren't from the old day and so

202
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:50,480
they don't see it the same way and you

203
00:06:48,889 --> 00:06:51,889
wouldn't recommend that anybody new

204
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:54,140
because that's something that they're

205
00:06:51,889 --> 00:06:56,870
completely uninvolved in and unaware of

206
00:06:54,139 --> 00:06:58,279
hata yeah and you can't make any

207
00:06:56,870 --> 00:07:00,050
mistakes and you can't put yourself in

208
00:06:58,279 --> 00:07:01,669
these terrible positions and so

209
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:02,960
basically you just get screwed and I'm

210
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:04,939
watching guys getting peeled for two

211
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:06,620
hundred pounds at a time you know that

212
00:07:04,939 --> 00:07:08,029
the the extractor was supposed to take

213
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:09,590
it boom extractor disappears all the

214
00:07:08,029 --> 00:07:11,059
stuffs going extract this business is

215
00:07:09,589 --> 00:07:13,519
out of here home he's moved out of the

216
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:14,629
area a new company picked it up and the

217
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:16,750
new company says we're not picking up

218
00:07:14,629 --> 00:07:19,399
any of the debt we've washed the debt

219
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:23,240
wears on my product we don't know but we

220
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:25,099
wash the debt and it's exhausting you

221
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:27,019
know and so a lot of it is trying to

222
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:28,939
find cats you can work with and trying

223
00:07:27,019 --> 00:07:30,979
to figure out how do you work because if

224
00:07:28,939 --> 00:07:33,949
we work in capacity and some in

225
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:35,450
sometimes tight sometimes loose but it

226
00:07:33,949 --> 00:07:37,579
lets us have an ability to continue

227
00:07:35,449 --> 00:07:39,170
going forward because once you really

228
00:07:37,579 --> 00:07:41,180
start to see the level that's coming

229
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:42,860
it's going to be mind-bending and when

230
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:44,240
they come in and start to whack this I

231
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:46,670
want to make sure that there's pieces

232
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:49,009
that existing appellations are existing

233
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:51,020
regions la has regions that are existing

234
00:07:49,009 --> 00:07:52,329
that an own spots of production people

235
00:07:51,019 --> 00:07:54,919
that are known for production

236
00:07:52,329 --> 00:07:57,889
proprietary methodologies strains

237
00:07:54,920 --> 00:08:01,009
selection and secondary post production

238
00:07:57,889 --> 00:08:02,479
handling processing all that stuff has

239
00:08:01,009 --> 00:08:04,730
value because nobody's just going to

240
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,480
come in and just take it over it's just

241
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:06,230
that they're going to come in and

242
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:08,270
they're going to come at you with

243
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:10,610
aggressive pricing and then lot egde and

244
00:08:08,269 --> 00:08:12,859
so we'll start to see it with genomics

245
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:14,780
where if we don't develop things that

246
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:17,240
work for us then they'll develop things

247
00:08:14,779 --> 00:08:19,129
that work in Kansas and Nebraska and

248
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:20,780
they'll be able to grow cannabis in

249
00:08:19,129 --> 00:08:22,670
those regions that have high heat and

250
00:08:20,779 --> 00:08:24,619
high humidity because they'll find the

251
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:27,140
cultivars at work and then they'll be

252
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:28,790
able to use other terpene methodologies

253
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:30,860
to enhance this for all the edible

254
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:32,659
markets for the for the pen markets and

255
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:35,180
um suddenly our markets getting

256
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:37,668
truncated and minimized and for me I'm

257
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:39,168
just like I just brawl it out right now

258
00:08:37,668 --> 00:08:41,120
as hard as I can and run as hard as I

259
00:08:39,168 --> 00:08:42,978
can and I just don't make any mistakes

260
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,889
by teaming up with anybody that's shady

261
00:08:42,979 --> 00:08:47,420
and anybody that's like you know we got

262
00:08:45,889 --> 00:08:48,939
big money I'm like you got big problems

263
00:08:47,419 --> 00:08:50,500
because in our world

264
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:53,020
we never just threw money at problems

265
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:57,820
like that I've never seen money wasted

266
00:08:53,019 --> 00:08:59,199
so much it's crazy but I'm like how did

267
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:01,180
you make this much money if you were

268
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,920
this stupid and it blows mind that's

269
00:09:01,179 --> 00:09:04,299
lucky and I'm like it it's real because

270
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:06,759
you weren't you were brilliant in a

271
00:09:04,299 --> 00:09:08,469
field but now you're taking it's called

272
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:09,610
I was I was a salvage diver for a while

273
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:12,009
right so I said do underwater

274
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:14,200
construction and you don't take data

275
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:16,689
from one table and extrapolate it to

276
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:18,280
another because you yes your residual

277
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:19,600
nitrogen's aren't the same and so all of

278
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:21,100
a sudden you start to find out you're

279
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,509
gonna die underwater because you took

280
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:24,909
data from one thing and applied it to

281
00:09:22,509 --> 00:09:27,580
another you don't have to do that in Nix

282
00:09:24,909 --> 00:09:28,389
gaslighted so I look at this and I'm let

283
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:30,190
me get this straight

284
00:09:28,389 --> 00:09:31,629
you did something here and you're gonna

285
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:34,660
apply it there and it's gonna be the

286
00:09:31,629 --> 00:09:36,639
same that's crazy and we've seen it

287
00:09:34,659 --> 00:09:39,219
every day and I'm almost grateful to

288
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:40,870
some respects because it allows some of

289
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:43,300
us to realize don't do that and run as

290
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:45,190
fast as you can but at the same time the

291
00:09:43,299 --> 00:09:47,289
money's so attractive to people who are

292
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:48,760
desperate that they believe that these

293
00:09:47,289 --> 00:09:50,289
guys with money are going to solve the

294
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:51,370
problem is these big new super

295
00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:53,319
distributors with all these massive

296
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:55,539
facilities are gonna solve your problems

297
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:57,310
I'm like these guys only got four stores

298
00:09:55,539 --> 00:10:00,639
they're moving to how the hell are gonna

299
00:09:57,309 --> 00:10:02,079
move 11 metric tons a week to four

300
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:04,059
stores and I got people that actually

301
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:05,590
say this to me I got seven acres outside

302
00:10:04,059 --> 00:10:07,869
like what are you gonna do with it I got

303
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:09,490
a store that's a good store do you have

304
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:10,870
because it better be the best store I'm

305
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:13,360
playing an earth because you know

306
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:15,730
because nobody's moving nobody's moving

307
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,500
a hundred thousand nobody's moving a

308
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:19,840
hundred thousand miles and they have a

309
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:21,309
flower market not distillate market

310
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,930
because in their mind they're you know

311
00:10:21,309 --> 00:10:26,529
and I'm just like I thought catching

312
00:10:22,929 --> 00:10:29,349
this that this is very directed and and

313
00:10:26,529 --> 00:10:31,269
you and you have to utilize individuals

314
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:33,970
that have careers in cannabis because we

315
00:10:31,269 --> 00:10:35,439
understand market yeah we understand

316
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:37,750
what people want to buy and we

317
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,400
understand that people are fickle and if

318
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,879
you don't have product twice they find a

319
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:41,588
new dealer

320
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:43,809
so they'll they'll come to you once

321
00:10:41,589 --> 00:10:45,040
you're gonna any fly now I'm out right

322
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:46,389
now all right I'll hit you again they

323
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:47,799
hit you twice I'm out they're going

324
00:10:46,389 --> 00:10:50,588
somewhere else and if that person

325
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:52,529
satisfies the deal and doesn't good you

326
00:10:50,589 --> 00:10:54,970
coming back you got to go and

327
00:10:52,529 --> 00:10:59,600
reestablish your whole distribution base

328
00:10:54,970 --> 00:11:01,490
and that's something I don't want to do

329
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,100
you know so what I'm what I'm doing now

330
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:06,230
is just doing some travel and and I'm

331
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:07,610
getting to meet people there in similar

332
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:10,009
situations where we're all trying to

333
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:11,480
chew our way through the system and our

334
00:11:10,009 --> 00:11:13,519
teeth are worn flat because we've been

335
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,930
chewing on it for so long already if you

336
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,940
have shiny sharp teeth

337
00:11:14,929 --> 00:11:18,500
you're too new I want to see a broken

338
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:20,720
tooth I want to see a couple of broken

339
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:22,818
what I mean the chipped one where you

340
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,500
fell on the ground and got kneed that

341
00:11:22,818 --> 00:11:27,110
lets me know that you at least

342
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:28,519
understand the ups and downs and then

343
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:29,959
what it does it puts you in a more

344
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:31,370
cautious position to where you're not

345
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:34,189
gonna run headlong right into failure

346
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:36,230
and then it lets us work with people

347
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:37,759
that are similar Minds you know and then

348
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:39,379
we have new facilities that are coming

349
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:40,550
online and it just lets us say listen

350
00:11:39,379 --> 00:11:42,439
these are the things you need to be

351
00:11:40,549 --> 00:11:43,939
aware of and if you want to mess with me

352
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:46,009
mess with me and if you don't don't

353
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:47,509
I'm building a whole new facility but

354
00:11:46,009 --> 00:11:48,860
it's not I'm getting into cannabis for

355
00:11:47,509 --> 00:11:50,419
the first time in my own goddamn life

356
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:52,940
all I'm doing is creating new

357
00:11:50,419 --> 00:11:55,669
methodologies so that I can keep up with

358
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:57,350
the pace of technology so that as it's

359
00:11:55,669 --> 00:12:00,289
moving it's just that my lawyer always

360
00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:03,470
says be the leading edge not the

361
00:12:00,289 --> 00:12:05,870
bleeding edge and so I I touch as much

362
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:07,790
tech as I can I touch as much scientific

363
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:09,049
shit as I can and because I got the

364
00:12:07,789 --> 00:12:11,509
message so many different University

365
00:12:09,049 --> 00:12:14,659
people and I do projects with

366
00:12:11,509 --> 00:12:16,669
universities on an intellectual sharing

367
00:12:14,659 --> 00:12:18,198
level it allows me for them to say hey

368
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:20,809
this is what we see this is where the

369
00:12:18,198 --> 00:12:23,750
problems are and then it lets me get

370
00:12:20,809 --> 00:12:26,299
awareness I wouldn't get you know and it

371
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:28,129
just helps it helps educate and I need

372
00:12:26,299 --> 00:12:29,809
it because otherwise I'm only as good as

373
00:12:28,129 --> 00:12:31,309
I am and I don't and I don't think I

374
00:12:29,809 --> 00:12:34,399
know the whole industry I'm not a master

375
00:12:31,309 --> 00:12:36,609
of distally that's not where I spent my

376
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,610
time
