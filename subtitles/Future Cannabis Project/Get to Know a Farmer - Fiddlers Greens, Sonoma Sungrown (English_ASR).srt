00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:35,859
let's start by smoking your flower

7
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:37,390
however you prefer to smoke it no guess

8
00:00:35,859 --> 00:00:40,119
I guess that would be rolling a joint

9
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:41,679
right that would and Andy we actually

10
00:00:40,119 --> 00:00:44,949
left the papers and the crutches over

11
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:47,640
there and you had one job to do that one

12
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:50,260
job to do got the ashtray clean though

13
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:52,390
as the funniest we've been smoking

14
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:58,530
cannabis all morning and preparation of

15
00:00:52,390 --> 00:01:02,469
smoking cannabis all afternoon my hands

16
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:04,808
just be shameful no no I love I love

17
00:01:02,469 --> 00:01:07,929
tools and utensils that I have had such

18
00:01:04,808 --> 00:01:10,209
a collection of different papers pipes

19
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:12,490
and bongs when I worked at the dive shop

20
00:01:10,209 --> 00:01:14,530
I used to make bongs and pipes out of

21
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:16,329
old scuba equipment because I'd sit in

22
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:19,659
this shed all day long waiting to fill

23
00:01:16,329 --> 00:01:22,060
scuba tanks for the Puerto Rican lobster

24
00:01:19,659 --> 00:01:23,679
fishermen on st. Croix and I'd be out

25
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:26,409
there all day long just sitting there

26
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,960
smoking joints and and working on scuba

27
00:01:26,409 --> 00:01:30,399
equipment and when I'd have leftover

28
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:45,339
parts I'd see how to make a smoking tour

29
00:01:30,399 --> 00:01:47,289
yeah hey get the regulator weed see ya

30
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:49,090

and have three Springs and a screw

32
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:53,560

33
00:01:51,938 --> 00:01:55,298
think we've already got some of the

34
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:58,840
Durban ready to go ground up this is one

35
00:01:55,299 --> 00:02:01,000
of our favorites Durban poison is what

36
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,509
people think of when they think of a

37
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,280
sativa

38
00:02:01,509 --> 00:02:06,759
this one's video it's originally from

39
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,830
Durban South Africa and it has been

40
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:12,280
grown in our family and friends of

41
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:13,660
cultivators for well over 20 years it's

42
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:15,099
one of my absolute favorite this smell

43
00:02:13,659 --> 00:02:17,229
is phenomenal well this is what like

44
00:02:15,099 --> 00:02:19,719
when Mel Frank talks about like I missed

45
00:02:17,229 --> 00:02:20,709
that original Durban poison I can't get

46
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:24,310
it again

47
00:02:20,709 --> 00:02:25,870
this is the 2017 Durban is well yeah

48
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:29,140
this is one of those things when you

49
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:31,090
talk to old school smokers and you open

50
00:02:29,139 --> 00:02:32,889
a jar of this you can just see the smile

51
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:34,359
on their face their eyes melt and

52
00:02:32,889 --> 00:02:36,458
they're just like all happy memories

53
00:02:34,359 --> 00:02:37,959
when people think of that happy giggly

54
00:02:36,459 --> 00:02:40,209
stuff they used to get way back in the

55
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:42,908
day we always light up a spliff of of

56
00:02:40,209 --> 00:02:43,569
the Durban and you know people it brings

57
00:02:42,908 --> 00:02:50,199
back memories

58
00:02:43,568 --> 00:02:52,179
I am the terpene Turpin allene so what

59
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:56,530
gives it that classic Durban smell to

60
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:58,120
love that unmistakable Durban and this

61
00:02:56,530 --> 00:03:01,719
is an early Durban so it's got a little

62
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:03,519
bit of a shorter flowering period but

63
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:06,579
it's we've been growing it in Sonoma

64
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:08,200
County for a long time and we're really

65
00:03:06,579 --> 00:03:10,090
trying to develop our own appellation

66
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:22,688
entire wah so we're gonna see how this

67
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:26,579
varies from everybody else like what

68
00:03:22,688 --> 00:03:26,578
French wines made their way to Sonoma

69
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:35,500
wines we have we love Sonoma County

70
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:38,769

81
00:03:59,829 --> 00:04:04,509

important people in the county right now

91
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:23,709
are women

92
00:04:21,098 --> 00:04:28,168
yeah like Shannon Cameron's wife our CEO

93
00:04:23,709 --> 00:04:29,659

94

just a rock star I've never seen anybody

102
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:48,470
be able to just grab a hold of a project

103
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:50,389
and this is something you know with all

104
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:52,610

construction and every little detail

110
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:08,480
there is we're in the position we are

111
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:10,699
because of Shannon's attention to detail

112
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:12,590
and just being a rock star animal and

113
00:05:10,699 --> 00:05:14,300
everything she does and she spent 20

114
00:05:12,589 --> 00:05:18,619
years as a project manager in telecom

115
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:20,150
and running massive projects and we've

116
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:21,860
built a restaurant together and ran that

117
00:05:20,149 --> 00:05:23,929
together we've rebuilt a sail boat

118
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:25,610
together and sailed that down the coast

119
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:28,790
and lived on it for almost two years

120
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:30,350
together and she's just amazing person

121
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:32,120
to work with you know it's a I have to

122
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:49,730
keep up you know she really makes me it

123
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:51,500
pushes me to Jody to well we just have

124
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:53,419
such there's no way you can do this

125
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:55,189
alone there is no way that anybody who

126
00:05:53,418 --> 00:05:57,229
was a small farmer and producer in the

127
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:58,969
beginning there's no way anybody can do

128
00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:00,560
this without a team and without a family

129
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:02,120
and that's why this is community we're

130
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,790
all trying to rally together to survive

131
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:06,560
this and it takes Jody and Andy and and

132
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:08,390
everybody else on our team we have

133
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,829
fantastic people that you know we have

134
00:06:08,389 --> 00:06:12,289
to hire the best the brightest and the

135
00:06:09,829 --> 00:06:14,240
smartest to run with things that we

136
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:16,480
never imagined we'd have to deal with I

137
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:24,889
just wanted to be a farmer and keeps

138
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:27,439
valedictorian so the Durbin that you

139
00:06:24,889 --> 00:06:30,289
said has been like between family and

140
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:34,189
friends for like 20-something years is

141
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:37,280
that kind of like the hero cultivar of

142
00:06:34,189 --> 00:06:39,620
your life if you had to pick one that

143
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:42,529
you want Fiddler's greens to be known

144
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:44,540
for that's a tricky question because we

145
00:06:42,529 --> 00:06:47,059
do different things for our Durban

146
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:49,460
flower for our heritage you know one of

147
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:50,810
those classic heirloom strains we

148
00:06:49,459 --> 00:06:52,549
absolutely want to be known for the

149
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:54,350
Durban especially to carry on the

150
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:57,020
tradition there are some great people

151
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:59,000
who started this before us and it's it's

152
00:06:57,019 --> 00:07:01,219
a real honor to continue to be growing

153
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,470
this because you know we weren't first

154
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:04,729
by any stretch of the imagination and we

155
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:06,410
just want to show respect to the people

156
00:07:04,728 --> 00:07:08,359
who got us here and brought us here so

157
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:11,300
can you talk about any of them and what

158
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:13,819
they taught you the people that taught

159
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:16,490
us the people who taught me to cultivate

160
00:07:13,819 --> 00:07:19,189
this is the primary strain we grew and I

161
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:21,530
started out you know lugging dirt and

162
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:23,870
trimming and washing pots and being the

163
00:07:21,529 --> 00:07:25,698
grunt laborer for these guys and yeah

164
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:28,490
all of us all of us learned you know

165
00:07:25,699 --> 00:07:30,500
working for these guys and you know they

166
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:32,720
they were just really neat people who

167
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:36,500
are travelers and we met we all met in

168
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,729
the Caribbean overtime and we run into

169
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:41,750
each other everywhere we go in the world

170
00:07:37,728 --> 00:07:43,339
I was not a part of that these guys have

171
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:50,300
a couple of years on me believe it or

172
00:07:43,339 --> 00:07:52,339
not but I mean I am in it now the hands

173
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:59,689
in the dirt part well

174
00:07:52,339 --> 00:08:01,219
metaphorically what I can say yeah and

175
00:07:59,689 --> 00:08:03,560
there's amazing people that are still

176
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:06,950
trying to survive you know the the new

177
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:08,089
regulation era and you know we just want

178
00:08:06,949 --> 00:08:09,228
to make sure that everybody survives

179
00:08:08,089 --> 00:08:11,478
that we're trying to make sure that the

180
00:08:09,228 --> 00:08:13,310
people who started this and got us here

181
00:08:11,478 --> 00:08:16,189
with this that they get recognition and

182
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:17,810
you know that they are given a place to

183
00:08:16,189 --> 00:08:20,538
carry on in this industry because it's

184
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:22,129
been so drastic you know the the

185
00:08:20,538 --> 00:08:26,389
regulations that it's difficult to

186
00:08:22,129 --> 00:08:29,050
survive I yeah I just went about that OC

187
00:08:26,389 --> 00:08:31,060
normal meeting where the guy

188
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:33,639
he started off talking about those

189
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:35,168
growing practices but the rest was

190
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:38,588
talking about the laws and what they're

191
00:08:35,168 --> 00:08:39,908
trying to do and and essentially how

192
00:08:38,589 --> 00:08:41,289
they're trying to survive and there's

193
00:08:39,908 --> 00:08:44,919
you can see kind of difference between

194
00:08:41,288 --> 00:08:46,629
them the LBC a but they both do separate

195
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:49,569
cool things ago BCA they have like a

196
00:08:46,629 --> 00:08:51,879
guarantee hire process essentially we're

197
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:55,230
like anyone who like they want to like

198
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:55,230
set up something where they have like a

199
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,890
they want people through a program and

200
00:08:58,269 --> 00:09:03,060
they kind of get certified and it's not

201
00:08:59,889 --> 00:09:05,708
an official certification is no actual

202
00:09:03,059 --> 00:09:07,509
but essentially you recognize than

203
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:10,059
anywhere throughout Long Beach any club

204
00:09:07,509 --> 00:09:12,549
they're prepared are you next to those

205
00:09:10,059 --> 00:09:14,500
systems in place to to protect the

206
00:09:12,549 --> 00:09:16,359
community and to give people you know

207
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:18,730
more incentive because when you're

208
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:19,839
bringing things to a city council

209
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:25,959
meeting you know you need to have

210
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:27,190
positive approach to beyond just we got

211
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:28,479
to keep doing that we got to keep going

212
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:29,950
to the City Council meetings we got to

213
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,528
go to the Board of Supervisors meetings

214
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:33,910
we got a call and right because these

215
00:09:32,528 --> 00:09:36,399
regulations aren't the end-all be-all

216
00:09:33,909 --> 00:09:37,809
it's the camels nose under the tent we

217
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,009
got to keep showing up about a keep

218
00:09:37,809 --> 00:09:41,289
fighting we've got to change the

219
00:09:39,009 --> 00:09:42,759
regulations so that they make sense

220
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:44,799
you know most of these people that wrote

221
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:46,480
the regulations have no idea what we do

222
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:50,259
they have no idea how the cannabis

223
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:52,509
business operates and they're they're

224
00:09:50,259 --> 00:09:53,889
writing rules blind but every time that

225
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:55,179
we contact them and we try to work with

226
00:09:53,889 --> 00:09:57,309
them we're getting good reception

227
00:09:55,179 --> 00:09:58,809
they're listening they're trying and so

228
00:09:57,309 --> 00:10:01,750
we need to you know yeah we need the

229
00:09:58,809 --> 00:10:03,549
angry activism but we also need to meet

230
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:05,950
people where their understanding is and

231
00:10:03,549 --> 00:10:08,078
guide them along into the right way and

232
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:09,670
we're pioneers for a reason you know

233
00:10:08,078 --> 00:10:13,899
it's if it was easy everybody would be

234
00:10:09,669 --> 00:10:16,719
doing it so we never answered your

235
00:10:13,899 --> 00:10:18,549
question yeah you were asking what we

236
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,750
would want to be known for but the other

237
00:10:18,549 --> 00:10:21,069
one that we would want to be known for

238
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:24,009
is our ACDC

239
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:26,500
we're seven the tincture here but the

240
00:10:24,009 --> 00:10:28,389
ACDC is a high CBD flower it stands for

241
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:30,549
alternative cannabinoid dietary

242
00:10:28,389 --> 00:10:34,360
consumption the alternative cannabinoid

243
00:10:30,549 --> 00:10:37,000
refers to CBD versus THC and the dietary

244
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:38,159
consumption meant that it was indicated

245
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,250
to be taken orally or

246
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:43,769
ingested as a whole flower and the ac/dc

247
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:46,860
is traditionally a fairly difficult

248
00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:48,809
plant to grow it's pretty spindly and it

249
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:51,060
flops around but we've been growing it

250
00:10:48,809 --> 00:10:52,529
for many years now and it really likes

251
00:10:51,059 --> 00:10:55,709
where we are in Sonoma County we've

252
00:10:52,529 --> 00:10:57,509
gotten it too you know the it's really

253
00:10:55,710 --> 00:11:00,660
thriving and we're hoping the longer we

254
00:10:57,509 --> 00:11:02,700
grow is a it's amazing that is what when

255
00:11:00,659 --> 00:11:04,889
you have something like that are you

256
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:09,060
still trying to kind of gently breed it

257
00:11:04,889 --> 00:11:13,649
in a direction or you like this is

258
00:11:09,059 --> 00:11:17,399
perfect as is now I just need to get it

259
00:11:13,649 --> 00:11:20,279
consistently like where every flowering

260
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:21,269
plant is like pretty much the same you

261
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:23,789
trying to take care of the soil

262
00:11:21,269 --> 00:11:25,259
differently better every year also at

263
00:11:23,789 --> 00:11:27,179
the plant you find out where it thrives

264
00:11:25,259 --> 00:11:29,939
in an ecosystem and then try to foster

265
00:11:27,179 --> 00:11:34,919
that ecosystem but your true but that's

266
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:37,080
addressing this iteration of that plant

267
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:39,569
are you are you like I'm happy with

268
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:41,639
where ac/dc is are you trying to breed

269
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:44,940
it in some sort of direction to express

270
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:46,980
itself slightly differently I don't

271
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:48,810
think we're there yet we're still you

272
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:50,009
know everybody's still learning on this

273
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:52,559
and this is a new form that we're

274
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:54,240
regenerating four years ago it was

275
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:57,179
almost a used-car lot there was a 12

276
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:59,940
jump cars everywhere the place was

277
00:11:57,179 --> 00:12:01,620
destroyed that it was nasty and so we've

278
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:03,240
been rehabilitating and cleaning up this

279
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:04,830
place but it was the one place that we

280
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:07,019
found that we could get permitted to

281
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:08,550
cultivate on and so we're rehabbing this

282
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:10,649
farm we're working on the soil we had

283
00:12:08,549 --> 00:12:12,629
this golden Ridge soil which was

284
00:12:10,649 --> 00:12:16,139
basically inert so we've been working

285
00:12:12,629 --> 00:12:18,029
with compost and to get it to a point

286
00:12:16,139 --> 00:12:19,409
where you felt comfortable plants

287
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:22,709
because you plants in the soil right

288
00:12:19,409 --> 00:12:25,379
yeah so what you need to do from

289
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:28,110
junkyard to feeling confident about

290
00:12:25,379 --> 00:12:29,610
planting that in the soil we're lucky

291
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:32,159
that in the space that we cleared for

292
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:34,379
cultivation was a little bit of ways

293
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:36,449
from where most of the junk cars were it

294
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:38,909
was where our parking is and things like

295
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:40,290
that that there is a bunch of junk cars

296
00:12:38,909 --> 00:12:41,879
that got hauled away and when we'd stick

297
00:12:40,289 --> 00:12:44,669
a shovel in the ground we'd find a box

298
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:48,389
of forks or it was odd restaurant things

299
00:12:44,669 --> 00:12:49,409
or a radiator little hotel room service

300
00:12:48,389 --> 00:12:51,299
salt and pepper shaker

301
00:12:49,409 --> 00:12:52,500
and we found them forever while we were

302
00:12:51,299 --> 00:12:54,779
cleaning all that out and we basically

303
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:56,850
accumulated all the junk but where our

304
00:12:54,779 --> 00:13:00,179
cultivation space is which were only

305
00:12:56,850 --> 00:13:02,100
allowed 10,000 square feet it's fairly

306
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:03,839
fresh and there wasn't much anything

307
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:08,070
else but it's this golden rich soil

308
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:09,509
which basically has nothing in it and so

309
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:11,820
we've been working with Google culture

310
00:13:09,509 --> 00:13:13,919
and we're slowly working ourselves

311
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:16,080
towards the North no-till and a

312
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:18,059
closed-loop system but every year we

313
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:20,280
plant cover crops and then we chop and

314
00:13:18,059 --> 00:13:23,639
drop we add compost we create our own

315
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:26,220
compost what what cover crops are you

316
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:30,960
growing for what kind of minerals or

317
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:32,730
nutrients like I'm not sure on that the

318
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:34,460
minerals and nutrients that we're

319
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:36,060
specifically trying to work on

320
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:37,530
unfortunately that's one of the things

321
00:13:36,059 --> 00:13:39,449
that's tough about what we're doing now

322
00:13:37,529 --> 00:13:41,850
is I don't get to spend time on the farm

323
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:43,440
anymore I had the guys that I learned

324
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:46,019
from the guys that I look up to as

325
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,450
cultivators are now in charge of our

326
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:52,049
cultivation team and so the only way I

327
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:56,070
get to follow up oh yeah everybody on

328
00:13:52,049 --> 00:13:58,859
earth yeah yeah some of our all of our

329
00:13:56,070 --> 00:14:00,480
cultivators I really look up to man they

330
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:01,830
know so much more than I do and it's

331
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,779
gone so much further than where we

332
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:10,710
started we'll talk about some of the

333
00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:12,659
things would you were asking what we

334
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:14,340
just did with the ac/dc two years ago

335
00:14:12,659 --> 00:14:16,289
went through through the ground we grew

336
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:19,350
them the best we could and they tested a

337
00:14:16,289 --> 00:14:21,329
20 to 1 CBD THC then they all went and

338
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:23,220
took classes on bio dynamics

339
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:26,070
permaculture and they dug Google beds

340
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:28,139
you know with dead oak boughs compost

341
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:29,610
grass clippings put the plants on top of

342
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:32,879
that with earthworm tubes and create

343
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:34,680
living soil so less water more about

344
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:37,889
that I was working together and the next

345
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:39,149
year it tested a 30 to 1 CBD to THC so

346
00:14:37,889 --> 00:14:40,259
that's a way that they've all been

347
00:14:39,149 --> 00:14:42,149
working together trying to figure out

348
00:14:40,259 --> 00:14:44,009
the new practices try to build this soil

349
00:14:42,149 --> 00:14:45,659
so that each year the plants are

350
00:14:44,009 --> 00:14:49,200
hopefully a better example of themselves

351
00:14:45,659 --> 00:14:51,539
yeah I'm actually wondering if we keep

352
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:53,190
going how long it'll take to I think we

353
00:14:51,539 --> 00:14:54,569
said this before get if you keep growing

354
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:56,730
a strain in the same place over and over

355
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:58,980
and over again and take it back to seed

356
00:14:56,730 --> 00:15:01,050
or regenerate it so it gets that memory

357
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:01,899
of that place how long before we create

358
00:15:01,049 --> 00:15:08,889
it back to another

359
00:15:01,899 --> 00:15:13,329
landrace in a new place what Durbin

360
00:15:08,889 --> 00:15:16,330
there it is what I assume you have like

361
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:17,889
mothers on site and you're doing your

362
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:19,660
own clippings like you're not buying

363
00:15:17,889 --> 00:15:22,090
from nurseries so like you're

364
00:15:19,659 --> 00:15:23,769
essentially your own breeder and nursery

365
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:26,230
yeah we have our own nursery committee

366
00:15:23,769 --> 00:15:27,730
in order for us to keep everything we've

367
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:29,740
had trouble finding people that we

368
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:32,289
wanted to work with that we felt could

369
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:34,840
do things as well as we could and so

370
00:15:32,289 --> 00:15:36,699
because of that we do our own nursery we

371
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:38,920
do our own manufacture we do our own

372
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:41,680
processing we do our own distribution

373
00:15:38,919 --> 00:15:44,079
and we do everything education first and

374
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:45,489
so everybody and everybody our team

375
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:47,800
whether you're a cultivator or whether

376
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:49,600
you work in processing we all go around

377
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:51,579
and do each other's jobs so we all know

378
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,170
what each other has to deal with these

379
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:54,940
guys went up and spent their time

380
00:15:53,169 --> 00:15:56,949
working on the farm and they've also

381
00:15:54,940 --> 00:16:02,470
spent time working on the manufacturing

382
00:15:56,950 --> 00:16:03,610
production line yeah grass is always

383
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:05,440
greener on the other side of the fence

384
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:09,519
in this world I like all the sudden

385
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:14,470
traffic is sounding funny guys were

386
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:15,699
digging holes out their last three years

387
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:17,649
in a row the hottest days of the year

388
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:22,660
have been when we're going in the ground

389
00:16:17,649 --> 00:16:28,899
yeah I wait the Tuesday after meadowland

390
00:16:22,659 --> 00:16:33,339
yes I was driving from I was driving

391
00:16:28,899 --> 00:16:36,840
like past Santa Cruz and Salinas

392
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:39,100
sunlight it was like a hundred and ten

393
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:40,980
was brutal they're all digging holes

394
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:43,180
like no no I have stuff to do inside

395
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:45,580
well so what does that do to the plan

396
00:16:43,179 --> 00:16:47,019
yeah we've been hurting the plants off

397
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:49,420
for quite a while so they've been

398
00:16:47,019 --> 00:16:50,889
outdoors and the plants really I mean

399
00:16:49,419 --> 00:16:52,269
that's the terroir that's the

400
00:16:50,889 --> 00:16:54,939
appellation that's what we're gonna get

401
00:16:52,269 --> 00:16:56,919
naturally because we're so as yeah we're

402
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:59,020
so closing to the coast so we're gonna

403
00:16:56,919 --> 00:17:01,569
have hot days we're gonna have cold

404
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:03,340
nights we're gonna have fog and that's

405
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:04,720
just what we produce and that's what's

406
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:06,910
gonna affect the planet it's gonna show

407
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:09,009
different expressions based on how that

408
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:11,470
plant lives we have high winds up there

409
00:17:09,009 --> 00:17:14,470
or in the Petaluma windgap and so the

410
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:16,538
Durban the Durban and the ACDC bow

411
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:18,640
seem to really love it's a harsher

412
00:17:16,538 --> 00:17:20,949
condition and we go full term too so

413
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,839
we're not trying to rush you know a

414
00:17:20,949 --> 00:17:25,089
finish we let the plants go and that's

415
00:17:22,838 --> 00:17:27,908
you know we won the girl off last year

416
00:17:25,088 --> 00:17:31,329
and that was white Tahoe cookies and we

417
00:17:27,909 --> 00:17:33,039
put it in these Google beds and did

418
00:17:31,329 --> 00:17:34,569
compost teas and pretty much just let

419
00:17:33,038 --> 00:17:36,429
the plant you know tell us what it

420
00:17:34,569 --> 00:17:39,759
needed and we pretty much left it all so

421
00:17:36,429 --> 00:17:41,320
these ladies are not hos plants it takes

422
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:42,490
you got to listen to him you really got

423
00:17:41,319 --> 00:17:44,470
to watch them pay attention and we're

424
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:46,509
learning as we go all the time I mean we

425
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:47,829
make anybody who's been a cultivator has

426
00:17:46,509 --> 00:17:49,419
made mistakes

427
00:17:47,829 --> 00:17:50,678
you know the lesson is just not to make

428
00:17:49,419 --> 00:17:53,080
the same mistakes twice or learn to

429
00:17:50,679 --> 00:17:54,610
notice ahead of time and then setting up

430
00:17:53,079 --> 00:17:57,129
your system so you don't have to you

431
00:17:54,609 --> 00:17:59,048
know plant lots of beneficial plants get

432
00:17:57,130 --> 00:18:01,299
beneficial insects create a very bio

433
00:17:59,048 --> 00:18:05,048
diverse area because if you haven't so

434
00:18:01,298 --> 00:18:07,058
you're mixing cannabis and you said

435
00:18:05,048 --> 00:18:09,908
cover oh yeah all sorts of different

436
00:18:07,058 --> 00:18:13,029
yeah we're gonna do clovers over to you

437
00:18:09,909 --> 00:18:14,559
know different heights right hmm I love

438
00:18:13,029 --> 00:18:18,099
using cosmos they're beautiful flower

439
00:18:14,558 --> 00:18:21,190
sunflowers I love those cat nips a great

440
00:18:18,099 --> 00:18:22,829
one to have as a companion plant and of

441
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:25,690
course with the traditional herbs we do

442
00:18:22,829 --> 00:18:27,490
basil and thyme and rosemary and do you

443
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:29,830
know why like what's I mean obviously

444
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:32,558
some attract the right insects push off

445
00:18:29,829 --> 00:18:34,869
the wrong and others when they die they

446
00:18:32,558 --> 00:18:36,759
have good nutrients yeah we're learning

447
00:18:34,869 --> 00:18:38,229
as we go and we're just trying to create

448
00:18:36,759 --> 00:18:40,150
a lot of biodiversity out there along

449
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:42,308
the fence line we're planning the three

450
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:45,250
sisters we're doing corn squash and

451
00:18:42,308 --> 00:18:48,038
beans the corn you know does a good job

452
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:51,099
of screening aphids and then we also

453
00:18:48,038 --> 00:18:52,900
just we like the the biodiversity of it

454
00:18:51,099 --> 00:18:54,908
we also plant our food and vegetables

455
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:57,538
around there too we do gardens we're

456
00:18:54,909 --> 00:19:01,690
trying to create a Clos lucé this system

457
00:18:57,538 --> 00:19:05,589
and it's it's a lot of fun so take the

458
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:08,950
ac/dc so its expression of itself as

459
00:19:05,589 --> 00:19:11,619
flower which is here but then also

460
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:13,360
you're you're pushing it in different

461
00:19:11,619 --> 00:19:17,079
directions meaning from flower to

462
00:19:13,359 --> 00:19:21,149
tincture from flower to so other types

463
00:19:17,079 --> 00:19:23,398
of products so talk about how a specific

464
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:27,038
cultivar sort of

465
00:19:23,398 --> 00:19:28,359
expresses itself as its extracted well

466
00:19:27,038 --> 00:19:30,819
we don't really do an extraction the

467
00:19:28,359 --> 00:19:34,000
most important thing is what we do is a

468
00:19:30,819 --> 00:19:35,710
long slow cure you can grow the best

469
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,690
flower in the world but if you rush it

470
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:39,370
out the door it's not gonna have time to

471
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:41,350
mature you know you can do things like

472
00:19:39,369 --> 00:19:43,298
you can fresh freeze it and that's gonna

473
00:19:41,349 --> 00:19:45,038
retain the brightness that freshness

474
00:19:43,298 --> 00:19:47,619
it's like a young tequila that hasn't

475
00:19:45,038 --> 00:19:49,929
been aged it's you know very zingy and

476
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:52,178
poppy and green and you can flash freeze

477
00:19:49,929 --> 00:19:53,500
it and then you can extract from that

478
00:19:52,179 --> 00:19:55,778
and you're gonna get some wonderful live

479
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:59,169
resin or or you know some of this gonna

480
00:19:55,778 --> 00:20:01,269
be very bright but as cannabis is like

481
00:19:59,169 --> 00:20:02,620
wine if you it's almost the opposite of

482
00:20:01,269 --> 00:20:05,649
what you do that's the opposite of what

483
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:07,689
we do is we want a long slow cure so we

484
00:20:05,648 --> 00:20:09,668
dry it very slowly in specific humidity

485
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:12,190
and temperature conditions lots of air

486
00:20:09,669 --> 00:20:16,269
flow and what we want plant to do is

487
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:18,639
slowly allow the the chlorophyll and

488
00:20:16,269 --> 00:20:20,950
things like that to degrade and the the

489
00:20:18,638 --> 00:20:23,709
terpenes to express themselves fully and

490
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:26,080
oxidize just a little bit and that's

491
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:28,720
gonna continue to change and grow and

492
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:29,949
grow in depth and especially if you cure

493
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,350
it long enough to where it becomes

494
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:33,909
stable and you seal it off you can get

495
00:20:32,349 --> 00:20:36,849
great expression of terpenes it'll

496
00:20:33,909 --> 00:20:38,350
change over the years we had at ang cush

497
00:20:36,849 --> 00:20:40,480
that we aged for three years that was

498
00:20:38,349 --> 00:20:42,009
just velvety and wonderful we have some

499
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,139
Durban I mean we just smoked two

500
00:20:42,009 --> 00:20:46,000
different harvested Durban and you could

501
00:20:44,138 --> 00:20:50,288
tell that it gets that richer more full

502
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:53,619
flavor yeah so what you're saying about

503
00:20:50,288 --> 00:20:55,929
how we show the expression of the ACDC

504
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:57,638
you use the word extraction and we don't

505
00:20:55,929 --> 00:21:03,038
do an extraction which is what makes

506
00:20:57,638 --> 00:21:05,879
this different from a lot of it's just

507
00:21:03,038 --> 00:21:08,829
how we are how pillars is different than

508
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:12,010
there's the cure and then there's like

509
00:21:08,829 --> 00:21:15,879
the slow decarboxylation right that's

510
00:21:12,009 --> 00:21:17,829
right it's gonna oxidize oxidize a

511
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:19,929
little bit but we don't want it to D

512
00:21:17,829 --> 00:21:21,339
karbalaa because a lot of like our ACDC

513
00:21:19,929 --> 00:21:23,230
in our tincture lines we work with rock

514
00:21:21,339 --> 00:21:26,619
and AB annoyed so we want to cure it so

515
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:28,210
that it's got that the the it expresses

516
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:30,158
the right terpenes and changes just

517
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:32,139
enough but then we infuse it into

518
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:35,440
organic olive oil so we we want to have

519
00:21:32,138 --> 00:21:36,459
CBD a and THC a and C B G a and the

520
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,529
acidic cannabinoids

521
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:40,600
one line of our tinctures and then we do

522
00:21:38,529 --> 00:21:42,430
decarboxylate for the other line because

523
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:47,559
all of the different cannabinoids and

524
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:51,460
terpenoids system differently between

525
00:21:47,559 --> 00:21:54,940
raw CITIC and decarboxylated randomly

526
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:58,569
are you sourcing the olive oil from like

527
00:21:54,940 --> 00:22:00,460
California from Greece from are you

528
00:21:58,569 --> 00:22:03,039
learning about that part - we're like we

529
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:06,519
have a preference for we are really

530
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:07,809
looking for local producers and we're

531
00:22:06,519 --> 00:22:09,190
trying to talk we're in talks with a

532
00:22:07,809 --> 00:22:11,079
couple different local hala voya

533
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:12,580
producers but one of the scary things is

534
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:14,889
we have to go through a lot of lab

535
00:22:12,579 --> 00:22:16,539
testing process because of the testing

536
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:18,400
we have to do for our final products if

537
00:22:16,539 --> 00:22:26,559
any of the ingredients along the way and

538
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:28,570
olive oil is your canvas can be cleaned

539
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:30,849
but you fail because your olive oil now

540
00:22:28,569 --> 00:22:32,619
which is scary you know and a handmade

541
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:34,240
you know boutique product like that no

542
00:22:32,619 --> 00:22:36,519
that's cool so it seems like they're

543
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,349
kind of like craft NorCal all those

544
00:22:36,519 --> 00:22:40,660
farmers that's what we're looking for

545
00:22:38,349 --> 00:22:43,719
that's and matching them with your fine

546
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:51,759
craft cameras we made all right so the

547
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:54,850
bong has thrown Durban this is 2018 how

548
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:59,460
is the ac/dc smoked well we're gonna do

549
00:22:54,849 --> 00:23:05,439
that next right yeah yeah it's delicious

550
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:07,360
and that's you said this version was now

551
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:10,269
thirty to one where you originally were

552
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:11,979
24 to 1 yeah anything that's gonna keep

553
00:23:10,269 --> 00:23:14,799
going like at some point it's gonna be

554
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:20,289
like all right this is maxed out on CBD

555
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:22,299
as I can and I think we want to have the

556
00:23:20,289 --> 00:23:26,829
full like the the CBD is just one part

557
00:23:22,299 --> 00:23:29,549
of the plant it's a single no well so

558
00:23:26,829 --> 00:23:32,169
that kind of guess my question is like

559
00:23:29,549 --> 00:23:33,789
you're gonna lose something else if you

560
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:36,250
keep pushing the CBD it's like when

561
00:23:33,789 --> 00:23:38,319
people push THC as far as it can go

562
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:40,839
other people are now pushing CBD is for

563
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:42,490
it this one goes to 11 it's like that

564
00:23:40,839 --> 00:23:44,049
may not be the best though no it's not

565
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:45,700
something we're intentionally trying to

566
00:23:44,049 --> 00:23:48,099
do what we're doing is trying to create

567
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:49,519
a great living soil and in that we're

568
00:23:48,099 --> 00:23:50,779
gonna create the environment where the

569
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:52,519
plants gonna want to grow so we're not

570
00:23:50,779 --> 00:23:54,680
doing specific anything specific to

571
00:23:52,519 --> 00:23:56,569
alter the plant we just have been

572
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:58,700
working with the same genetics and class

573
00:23:56,569 --> 00:24:01,669
when you pick which ones to turn into

574
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:05,120
moms you are kind of selecting for

575
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:07,940
something right so what in for example

576
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:10,599
the ACDC in the last round of selection

577
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:13,519
do you kind of like I like this

578
00:24:10,599 --> 00:24:16,789
characteristic that this plant has

579
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:19,069
versus all the other ones we've been

580
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:21,829
pretty consistent with for several years

581
00:24:19,069 --> 00:24:24,319
growing this strain of ac/dc and we've

582
00:24:21,829 --> 00:24:25,519
got it pretty well stabilized and so

583
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:27,470
generally it's just with the vigor of

584
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:28,849
the plant that we look at and we refresh

585
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:29,990
our mothers quite frequently this year

586
00:24:28,849 --> 00:24:32,179
we're flowering out a bunch of the

587
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:34,370
mothers and we're also using it for our

588
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:35,870
grow six big ones we're gonna we're

589
00:24:34,369 --> 00:24:37,549
trying to encourage anybody who wants to

590
00:24:35,869 --> 00:24:40,369
grow their six plants to grow six plants

591
00:24:37,549 --> 00:24:42,579
and then share with somebody that can't

592
00:24:40,369 --> 00:24:44,299
grow or can't afford it or zoned out

593
00:24:42,579 --> 00:24:45,949
that way we're just trying to teach

594
00:24:44,299 --> 00:24:47,629
everybody to grow it at so you know get

595
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:50,269
your hands in it right are you doing any

596
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:51,410
tissue culture we are looking into that

597
00:24:50,269 --> 00:24:56,809
where it's interesting we're all

598
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:58,640
researching and reading books well

599
00:24:56,809 --> 00:25:00,349
that's that's one of those things we

600
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:04,250
have to research everything we're doing

601
00:25:00,349 --> 00:25:06,049
this is just a you know gone yeah we're

602
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:07,400
back in school non-stop if we're not

603
00:25:06,049 --> 00:25:09,230
reading articles we're sharing articles

604
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:11,090
we're going to lectures we go to

605
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:13,039
community groups we go to medical

606
00:25:11,089 --> 00:25:14,269
lectures to listen to the doctors and

607
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:17,149
the research tell us what's actually

608
00:25:14,269 --> 00:25:19,369
happening when we ingest cannabis we go

609
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:20,690
and listen to these amazing cultivators

610
00:25:19,369 --> 00:25:22,639
and old school people who've been doing

611
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:24,080
it for generations and we're trying to

612
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,490
learn from everybody and I love it that

613
00:25:24,079 --> 00:25:27,439
we get to do this out in the open now

614
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:29,569
that we get to talk to everybody because

615
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:31,490
for years we had to do this and then you

616
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:32,539
know unless you knew somebody nobody was

617
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:34,549
going to share with you how they were

618
00:25:32,539 --> 00:25:36,289
growing you know I walked around for

619
00:25:34,549 --> 00:25:38,329
years with a copy of Jorge with duct

620
00:25:36,289 --> 00:25:42,980
tape over the cover so I can read it in

621
00:25:38,329 --> 00:25:44,990
public I know thirty to one CBD to THC

622
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:50,029
right out of the garden it's amazing

623
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:54,410
just infuse into all of us about so

624
00:25:50,029 --> 00:25:58,569
what's our next cultivar and let's

625
00:25:54,410 --> 00:26:00,700
compare these two

626
00:25:58,569 --> 00:26:04,629
all right yeah so let's do it let's do

627
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:06,880
the silver og the silver og I'll let you

628
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:09,550
break this out and we're gonna use the

629
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:12,910
Firefly to vaporizer and then we have

630
00:26:09,549 --> 00:26:15,609
then Firefly 2 plus so I didn't tell us

631
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:17,140
about the 2 and the 2 plus these are a

632
00:26:15,609 --> 00:26:20,469
great little vaporizer you could do both

633
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:22,360
flower and concentrate or hash in it and

634
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:23,319
I've been learning how to use this it's

635
00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:25,389
kind of fun there's a bit of a learning

636
00:26:23,319 --> 00:26:33,399
curve with all of them but this one's

637
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:37,600
convection about the flower yeah so this

638
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:42,130
is um silver og from Spring Creek Azhar

639
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:44,709
Vanna White our friends le drew this on

640
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:47,920
Cassidy Rose actually won third place in

641
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:50,259
the Emerald cup in 2017 this is indica

642
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:51,580
style like you like you read about let's

643
00:26:50,259 --> 00:26:53,319
say every time we smoke this it's

644
00:26:51,579 --> 00:26:54,250
exactly what you're looking for at the

645
00:26:53,319 --> 00:26:55,299
end of the night when you don't want to

646
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:58,029
do anything anymore

647
00:26:55,299 --> 00:27:01,419
sit down please I just want to sit on

648

house yeah like that you know at I'm at

652
00:27:06,609 --> 00:27:11,500

653
00:27:08,829 --> 00:27:13,960

see they feed this swirl I don't feed

657
00:27:18,279 --> 00:27:22,450
the plant and it's amazing like going in

658
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:24,340
this place their farm is unbelievable

659
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:25,990
it's just 1% biodynamic you know they're

660
00:27:24,339 --> 00:27:27,879
totally off the grid up there they're

661
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:29,740

662
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:31,330
light depth you know he's a welder so

663

containers and all these amazing

665

00:27:33,609 --> 00:27:38,319
an amazing year up there stay to

667
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:39,900
delicious cannabis so we're lucky enough

668
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:41,889
to have them in our portfolio and

669
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:44,140
represent someone who's doing things the

670
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:46,330
right way you know beyond organic beyond

671
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:48,820
biodynamic just the way I'm supposed to

672
00:27:46,329 --> 00:27:49,929
be protecting from the Sun to the ground

673
00:27:48,819 --> 00:27:51,009
and doing it exactly the way it's

674
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:53,500
supposed to be introducing the right

675
00:27:51,009 --> 00:27:55,269
bugs the right ecosystem around it it's

676
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:56,740
it's the farmers one of the coolest

677
00:27:55,269 --> 00:27:58,569
sponsor events it was really cool

678
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:59,089
have you guys ever done big lines of

679
00:27:58,569 --> 00:28:09,799
code

680
00:27:59,089 --> 00:28:12,519
I don't understand the question okay

681
00:28:09,799 --> 00:28:15,200
what's Jodi like after one coca-cola

682
00:28:12,519 --> 00:28:22,549
this is or or a cup of coffe is waking

683
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:25,400
up in the I know so Gunder what you

684
00:28:22,549 --> 00:28:27,919
would be like if you did not smoke weed

685
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:31,910
and you took something like coffee no I

686
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:33,590
don't know we don't I don't think we

687
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:37,570
want to see that I thought I was in

688
00:28:33,589 --> 00:28:37,569
violence today to get to here yeah

689
00:28:40,009 --> 00:28:43,950
[Laughter]

690
00:28:45,069 --> 00:28:49,339
promised him when he came to work with

691
00:28:47,539 --> 00:28:59,779
this whole time was you can have

692
00:28:49,339 --> 00:29:03,169
infinity we had so this is the Firefly -

693
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:04,940
yeah and so and the - plus I've got this

694
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:06,289
one set for temperature it has an app

695
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:09,309
that you put on your phone so you can

696
00:29:06,289 --> 00:29:11,329
control the temperature with it and go

697
00:29:09,309 --> 00:29:14,269
I'm just to change the temperature

698
00:29:11,329 --> 00:29:16,099
because I love flower and vaping flower

699
00:29:14,269 --> 00:29:18,139
you really get to taste the terpenes and

700
00:29:16,099 --> 00:29:19,429
you get to text taste the complexity of

701
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:22,370
the flower without getting the

702
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:24,259
combustion in there and you can also do

703
00:29:22,369 --> 00:29:26,599
concentrates and hash out of this and

704
00:29:24,259 --> 00:29:27,680
you can change the temperature for you

705
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:29,629
know if you want to do the higher

706
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:31,610
temperature for the hash around 480 is

707
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:33,440
what I like and then I do a lower one

708
00:29:31,609 --> 00:29:35,569
for the flower so what do you do for the

709
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:37,100
flower temperature what I'm trying to

710
00:29:35,569 --> 00:29:41,809
run what I have it on here for I think

711
00:29:37,099 --> 00:29:46,759
280 I think - it no no 420 420 that's

712
00:29:41,809 --> 00:29:48,799
right talk about when you this is what I

713
00:29:46,759 --> 00:29:52,759
like is that this is flower you group

714
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:57,009
right are not sorry this is but imagine

715
00:29:52,759 --> 00:29:59,720
this for the flower you grew when years

716
00:29:57,009 --> 00:30:00,769
smoking the joint of that versus this I

717
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:03,350
know you touched on some of the

718
00:30:00,769 --> 00:30:05,450
differences but like what do you do you

719
00:30:03,349 --> 00:30:07,819
like it as much in a different way it's

720
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:09,620
like I like red and white wine I don't

721
00:30:07,819 --> 00:30:11,990
like all one all the time or all the

722
00:30:09,619 --> 00:30:13,819
other ones so like do you like vaping

723
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:15,680
your own flower sometimes oh I do

724
00:30:13,819 --> 00:30:18,710
absolutely I love to vape my own flower

725
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:21,500
I like to vape other flowers too - you

726
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:23,329
got a smoke and vape it I you know I

727
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:25,789
used to smoke and I use cannabis to stop

728
00:30:23,329 --> 00:30:27,769
smoking tobacco yeah but I still enjoy

729
00:30:25,789 --> 00:30:29,450
the combustion and you can detect

730
00:30:27,769 --> 00:30:31,549
different things when you combust the

731
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:33,380
flower you watch the way it burns you

732
00:30:31,549 --> 00:30:36,259
listen to the way it burns you smell it

733
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:40,040
you see how the ashes you see how the

734
00:30:36,259 --> 00:30:41,750
the ash holds together to see when will

735
00:30:40,039 --> 00:30:44,329
one the quality of the roll but to the

736
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:47,029
quality of the flour to hold a nice long

737
00:30:44,329 --> 00:30:49,220
ash that turns and white and you can

738
00:30:47,029 --> 00:30:51,109
smell if somebody didn't you know if it

739
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:52,970
was grown indoors and they used Newt if

740
00:30:51,109 --> 00:30:54,859
it wasn't flesh properly or if there was

741
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:56,360
something on the flower and then the

742
00:30:54,859 --> 00:31:01,519
same thing with the vape but you get

743
00:30:56,359 --> 00:31:02,808
more of that it's more herbal let's see

744
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:05,089
you don't get the combustion with you so

745
00:31:02,808 --> 00:31:07,460
you don't have you know the hot ash and

746
00:31:05,089 --> 00:31:09,199
you know it's got a good mouthfeel it's

747
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:20,929
like you know really getting the bouquet

748
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:24,529
a glass of wine before you take it yeah

749
00:31:20,929 --> 00:31:29,000
I view you at the end of the day of

750
00:31:24,529 --> 00:31:31,339
smoking as like if a horse start like

751
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:34,670
god it's it slips on a table like

752
00:31:31,339 --> 00:31:36,409
remember in a bachelor party you guys

753
00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:38,870
see the movie back to the part yeah

754
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:43,000
where the donkey starts eating all like

755
00:31:38,869 --> 00:31:43,000
the tranquilizers like rug

756
00:31:44,549 --> 00:31:54,309
that's the movie text yeah so what all

757
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:57,250
right so there's a new one on the market

758
00:31:54,309 --> 00:32:00,669
though yeah this is they call it the

759
00:31:57,250 --> 00:32:01,869
Firefly palace and they change the air

760
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:03,820
flow through it

761
00:32:01,869 --> 00:32:07,119
this one is nice but I feel like you

762
00:32:03,819 --> 00:32:08,649
have to draw a little hard on it you

763
00:32:07,119 --> 00:32:10,750
have to pull a little more firmly with

764
00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:13,110
it and this one Jody and I have been

765
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:16,599
using this one for the last three days

766
00:32:13,109 --> 00:32:18,759
and we've been testing and sampling some

767
00:32:16,599 --> 00:32:21,039
of Frenchie cannolis hash out of it and

768
00:32:18,759 --> 00:32:24,730
it is can we do that out of this one

769
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:26,559
absolutely right absolutely and so so

770
00:32:24,730 --> 00:32:30,430
Jody what are our thoughts on the

771
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:32,109
difference between the two this is the

772
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:34,360
first time I've used this one we've

773
00:32:32,109 --> 00:32:36,399
worked on getting this one dialed in so

774
00:32:34,359 --> 00:32:39,000
I've been smoking out of that one

775
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:42,070
I see you've never used the older one

776
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:44,170
and this is the friend she had yeah this

777
00:32:42,069 --> 00:32:47,139
is somewhat French assassin strawberry

778
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:49,360
banana with that metal lens when we got

779
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:55,230
to do the hookah there that was amazing

780
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:58,389
from whose farm you know Oh flower it is

781
00:32:55,230 --> 00:33:01,509
so this is this so frenchie did that

782
00:32:58,390 --> 00:33:04,650
with his flower yes okay with flour it

783
00:33:01,509 --> 00:33:04,650
is farm flour

784
00:33:05,829 --> 00:33:10,628
yeah that's great you just touch the

785
00:33:07,878 --> 00:33:22,579
sides and the bowl heats up there and

786
00:33:10,628 --> 00:33:31,638
just take a nice easy pull on it oh man

787
00:33:22,579 --> 00:33:33,368
that tastes so good that's what's that

788
00:33:31,638 --> 00:33:36,858
tasting like for you

789
00:33:33,368 --> 00:33:38,808
they've it's that perfect hash flavor

790
00:33:36,858 --> 00:33:43,489
you know it's just a little bit floral

791
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:45,618
you can just taste its Hashashin I think

792
00:33:43,489 --> 00:33:48,159
our hash oisin is the the terpene that

793
00:33:45,618 --> 00:33:50,898
they're equated it to but beta was a

794
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:53,929
beta Kari awfully and I'm no beta mercy

795
00:33:50,898 --> 00:33:57,199
in beta Mersin when it's aged in hash it

796
00:33:53,929 --> 00:33:59,989
converts to a terpene hash machine which

797
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:02,798
gives the cannabis are the hash that

798
00:33:59,989 --> 00:34:02,798
hash flavor

799
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:19,599

987
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:47,789
yeah why should I get super high dude

988
00:45:48,449 --> 00:45:55,868
how long does it take and go alright so

989
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:59,889
for the temperature set it for dry herb

990
00:45:55,869 --> 00:46:02,740
we should be two flashing amber LEDs as

991
00:45:59,889 --> 00:46:04,659
the default heat sitting setting to

992
00:46:02,739 --> 00:46:07,149
increase vapor intensity select one of

993
00:46:04,659 --> 00:46:09,909
the higher presets for lighter vapor

994
00:46:07,150 --> 00:46:12,700
reduced to low indicated by one amber

995
00:46:09,909 --> 00:46:15,578
LED the concentrated preset is indicated

996
00:46:12,699 --> 00:46:18,659
by three flashing L red LEDs and should

997
00:46:15,579 --> 00:46:18,660
not be used for herbs

998
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:32,329
back to my bong wait it's a three

999
00:46:28,909 --> 00:46:33,949
passion if it's green flashing that's

1000
00:46:32,329 --> 00:46:35,539
giving the battery indication it says

1001
00:46:33,949 --> 00:46:38,089
press and hold the mode button to

1002
00:46:35,539 --> 00:46:39,529
display battery level release then press

1003
00:46:38,090 --> 00:46:50,870
and hold again to display the current

1004
00:46:39,530 --> 00:47:09,650
heat setting Cameron I'm loving your

1005
00:46:50,869 --> 00:47:16,250
focus right now I'm admiring it wow this

1006
00:47:09,650 --> 00:47:22,849
is the first time I go down there cuz I

1007
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:26,960
was all misty out before we don't wanna

1008
00:47:22,849 --> 00:47:32,139
go that high Oh damnit I think we had it

1009
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:32,139
but I went to concentrate focus alright

1010
00:47:33,489 --> 00:47:40,899
we need you now we've got it all right

1011
00:47:37,670 --> 00:47:40,900
we're on herb hi

1012
00:47:43,010 --> 00:47:47,630
how do you go into that mode where you

1013
00:47:44,989 --> 00:47:50,509
change the temperature alright so you

1014
00:47:47,630 --> 00:47:53,000
press and hold this mode button once and

1015
00:47:50,510 --> 00:47:54,560
then release press and hold again and

1016
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,869
then the second time it will show the

1017
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:59,750
heat level and then you click on it to

1018
00:47:56,869 --> 00:48:01,880
cycle through and with the three amber

1019
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:04,190
lights it's the high setting for herb

1020
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:11,480
and so I think we should set our phasers

1021
00:48:04,190 --> 00:48:40,429
for high we're on three clicks to start

1022
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:43,340
it one push here yeah I could taste it

1023
00:48:40,429 --> 00:48:45,858
didn't get much vapor yeah I smell you

1024
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:56,420
have to keep cranking it up so wait for

1025
00:48:45,858 --> 00:48:58,719
the long buzz go the champion of the

1026
00:48:56,420 --> 00:48:58,720
hookah

1027
00:49:04,090 --> 00:49:09,590
fantasy yeah it tastes it tastes good

1028
00:49:06,590 --> 00:49:11,210
you're not seeing a cloud but what was

1029
00:49:09,590 --> 00:49:13,930
that somebody told us if you see a big

1030
00:49:11,210 --> 00:49:17,090
cloud it's like spinning your beer out

1031
00:49:13,929 --> 00:49:18,829
no as we were told that it's what I was

1032
00:49:17,090 --> 00:49:20,119
told is you breathe it in naturally and

1033
00:49:18,829 --> 00:49:21,139
you breathe it out naturally and that's

1034
00:49:20,119 --> 00:49:22,190
gonna maximize the amount of

1035
00:49:21,139 --> 00:49:25,299
cannabinoids you're getting out of the

1036
00:49:22,190 --> 00:49:28,849
smoke holding it yes just creating a

1037
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:30,560
when I use that at home I never see

1038
00:49:28,849 --> 00:49:32,299
vapor but then I'm always like I'm

1039
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:33,590
really high right now so it's definitely

1040
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:37,170
worth

1041
00:49:33,590 --> 00:49:38,280
don't really say very same thing nut

1042
00:49:37,170 --> 00:49:42,510
tastes great

1043
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:44,610
I suppose say oh think maybe it's so

1044
00:49:42,510 --> 00:49:45,090
good that just shows it here air coming

1045
00:49:44,610 --> 00:49:47,190
up

1046
00:49:45,090 --> 00:49:50,570
it's just buzzing now it's going crazy

1047
00:49:47,190 --> 00:49:50,570
yeah it's going crazy

1048
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:57,090
[Laughter]

1049
00:49:54,050 --> 00:50:03,090
yeah it's guy it does seem to have been

1050
00:49:57,090 --> 00:50:05,100
effective certainly but wait a minute I

1051
00:50:03,090 --> 00:50:12,090
got to go back to my roots this is what

1052
00:50:05,099 --> 00:50:13,920
I carry with me everywhere man I think

1053
00:50:12,090 --> 00:50:16,170
that was the first thing I ever smoked

1054
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:21,420
out of I've been six grand or something

1055
00:50:16,170 --> 00:50:23,340
that and a profile of the pro I would

1056
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:28,470
always bend the poker and you could

1057
00:50:23,340 --> 00:50:30,300
never get it back into its holder if you

1058
00:50:28,469 --> 00:50:34,709
didn't clean everyone so what you do

1059
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:36,269
yeah yeah dugouts are the best I've

1060
00:50:34,710 --> 00:50:45,659
carried one of these for over 20 years

1061
00:50:36,269 --> 00:50:49,369
I carry my ball wherever I go really big

1062
00:50:45,659 --> 00:50:49,369
pockets yes you do

1063
00:50:51,699 --> 00:50:56,829
this thing's pretty nifty all right what

1064
00:50:54,550 --> 00:51:03,550
are we smoking under the battery the

1065
00:50:56,829 --> 00:51:04,900
baddie is Durban we've been it's been in

1066
00:51:03,550 --> 00:51:10,390
and out of the lineup tonight we have

1067
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:12,250
some gg4 it's delicious

1068
00:51:10,389 --> 00:51:15,750
all right so what do we have if we go

1069
00:51:12,250 --> 00:51:18,570
down the line what do we have

1070
00:51:15,750 --> 00:51:21,159
Vanna White take it away

1071
00:51:18,570 --> 00:51:22,380
these moltke from Yolo right for my guys

1072
00:51:21,159 --> 00:51:25,119
out there mm-hmm

1073
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:27,300
so yes we have a GG for and I'm endo

1074
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:30,099
breath from our friends in yellow County

1075
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:34,330
two three four it's great indica style

1076
00:51:30,099 --> 00:51:36,429
so this gets you nice nice body high

1077
00:51:34,329 --> 00:51:38,500
it's only 16% so it doesn't make you

1078
00:51:36,429 --> 00:51:40,059
stupid so you can still get up and go do

1079
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:42,789
things cuz I don't particularly care

1080
00:51:40,059 --> 00:51:44,949
about any Kara sativa so I try to keep

1081
00:51:42,789 --> 00:51:47,349
doing everything in my life for me no

1082
00:51:44,949 --> 00:51:48,579
matter what I'm smoking the meadow

1083
00:51:47,349 --> 00:51:50,739
brothers a little more sativa style

1084
00:51:48,579 --> 00:51:52,150
though a little higher THC as well great

1085
00:51:50,739 --> 00:51:56,139
uplifting makes you want to go them now

1086
00:51:52,150 --> 00:52:00,340
and do things yeah and then we smoke the

1087
00:51:56,139 --> 00:52:13,179
Silver Creek og from Spring Creek og

1088
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:14,260
Spring Creek from silver flower for

1089
00:52:13,179 --> 00:52:16,480
rosin yeah

1090
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:17,860
just for fun yeah I've never done

1091
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:20,800
anything on a commercial scale we're

1092
00:52:17,860 --> 00:52:22,930
learning we're talking to some people we

1093
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:25,539
would love to do something 100 meter

1094
00:52:22,929 --> 00:52:26,889
hash is what we call it all the farms

1095
00:52:25,539 --> 00:52:28,719
that we work with in all the farms that

1096
00:52:26,889 --> 00:52:30,759
are out there that grow and specialize

1097
00:52:28,719 --> 00:52:33,219
in their own strain we would love to see

1098
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:35,140
all of them make the top shelf hash from

1099
00:52:33,219 --> 00:52:36,549
all of their flour and call it the

1100
00:52:35,139 --> 00:52:37,839
hundred meter hash that's what we call

1101
00:52:36,550 --> 00:52:39,850
it's the hash that never makes it 100

1102
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:42,039
meters off the farm you know that's

1103
00:52:39,849 --> 00:52:43,239
something that's that specialty craft

1104
00:52:42,039 --> 00:52:45,909
right there that's something that's

1105
00:52:43,239 --> 00:52:47,529
gonna set each area apart is you know

1106
00:52:45,909 --> 00:52:49,989
just like you hear Frenchie talk about

1107
00:52:47,530 --> 00:52:51,519
the hash maker's he's met that they

1108
00:52:49,989 --> 00:52:53,500
don't care about the strain they care

1109
00:52:51,519 --> 00:52:55,509
about what valley it was grown in what

1110
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:57,070
altitude it was grown in what were the

1111
00:52:55,510 --> 00:52:59,110
weather condition where it was grown and

1112
00:52:57,070 --> 00:53:01,539
that determined the quality and the care

1113
00:52:59,110 --> 00:53:03,220
of the aging and the the processing of

1114
00:53:01,539 --> 00:53:03,820
the plant how much care you take through

1115
00:53:03,219 --> 00:53:07,329
it and how you

1116
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:10,030
Russia that's gonna make a lot of really

1117
00:53:07,329 --> 00:53:12,519
special places popped forward and the

1118
00:53:10,030 --> 00:53:16,450
people that really learn the craft well

1119
00:53:12,519 --> 00:53:19,780
it's funny I asked Frenchy is like la

1120
00:53:16,449 --> 00:53:21,789
creme right that what he considers to be

1121
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:26,110
the best out of like a hundred pound

1122
00:53:21,789 --> 00:53:28,750
batch does he keep it for himself still

1123
00:53:26,110 --> 00:53:30,610
or does he put is he like I really want

1124
00:53:28,750 --> 00:53:33,429
this just for me but I have to put it

1125
00:53:30,610 --> 00:53:35,920
into the market and I think he's the

1126
00:53:33,429 --> 00:53:38,440
firm's own self yeah yeah I get that

1127
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:40,090
that's my head's - for the year then

1128
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:42,880
like president gave me other seven or

1129
00:53:40,090 --> 00:53:44,829
eight times but yeah because it sounds

1130
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:46,660
like he eats a ton back Oh baby's gonna

1131
00:53:44,829 --> 00:53:47,489
take the best stuff off of the best of

1132
00:53:46,659 --> 00:53:50,259
the best

1133
00:53:47,489 --> 00:53:51,939
mm-hmm after but that's great I used

1134
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:53,500
when I was in Amsterdam I used to put

1135
00:53:51,940 --> 00:53:55,150
hash in my coffee every morning and

1136
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:57,699

1153
00:54:53,510 --> 00:54:56,420
too but that's part of the nice things

1154
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:58,639
about you know that's the way the

1155
00:54:56,420 --> 00:55:01,340
vaporizers is the vaporizers you can do

1156
00:54:58,639 --> 00:55:03,559
good hash or concentrates and vape it

1157
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:07,250
not have to have the blowtorch that's

1158
00:55:03,559 --> 00:55:21,949
why the putco peak is so badass no

1159
00:55:07,250 --> 00:55:24,139
freakin torch well that one's still the

1160
00:55:21,949 --> 00:55:24,619
strawberry banana you will start with

1161
00:55:24,139 --> 00:55:27,440
that one

1162
00:55:24,619 --> 00:55:35,029
well done both all right so that's what

1163
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:36,409
we did on in Firefly 2 plus yeah so this

1164
00:55:35,030 --> 00:55:37,040
will be a different experience than that

1165
00:55:36,409 --> 00:55:39,349
for sure

1166
00:55:37,039 --> 00:55:42,050
yeah so just a little bit in there this

1167
00:55:39,349 --> 00:55:45,110
thing's awesome you push it twice and

1168
00:55:42,050 --> 00:55:47,900
heats up for 20 seconds and then after

1169
00:55:45,110 --> 00:55:49,039
20 seconds it'll go green and then you

1170
00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:51,110
can started pulling it like a Bonnie

1171
00:55:49,039 --> 00:55:56,779
that's how simple that dab is I got a

1172
00:55:51,110 --> 00:56:00,140
blowtorch I'm shit fuckin Charlie butane

1173
00:55:56,780 --> 00:56:02,420
you're at a beauty it also does is it

1174
00:56:00,139 --> 00:56:04,989
gives you the ability to dab just like

1175
00:56:02,420 --> 00:56:11,710
every for say

1176
00:56:04,989 --> 00:56:17,099
you would do it puts mind-numbing davits

1177
00:56:11,710 --> 00:56:19,690
at your fingertips at any distance yeah

1178
00:56:17,099 --> 00:56:22,059
and then after about 20 seconds it beats

1179
00:56:19,690 --> 00:56:23,920
a opening yep that's it and beep so you

1180
00:56:22,059 --> 00:56:24,820
push it twice and it read does another

1181
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:27,070
20 seconds

1182
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:29,110
yeah so you can do that before hope you

1183
00:56:27,070 --> 00:56:43,930
like what channel is on because you're

1184
00:56:29,110 --> 00:56:46,900
not changing that is no and Joe do you

1185
00:56:43,929 --> 00:56:52,299
tell us the story of the dude who got

1186
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:54,190
skull belong to no it's just from

1187
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:57,550
Thailand where they do not care for

1188
00:56:54,190 --> 00:57:01,570
cannabis yet but I figured it would be a

1189
00:56:57,550 --> 00:57:02,980
good place to put you weed so I brought

1190
00:57:01,570 --> 00:57:08,559
back for camera and of course he put his

1191
00:57:02,980 --> 00:57:11,250
weed in the fucking eyeballs and not it

1192
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:11,250
was missing a little something

1193
00:57:14,099 --> 00:57:25,329
that's so tasty all right well so

1194
00:57:21,070 --> 00:57:32,010
compare the taste of the same Frenchy

1195
00:57:25,329 --> 00:57:32,009
hash out of the Firefly and the puff Co

1196
00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:36,989
we're gonna have to go back and visit

1197
00:57:42,150 --> 00:57:55,780
and when doing a concentrate you need to

1198
00:57:44,730 --> 00:58:01,059
give it a few pulls to get it melted and

1199
00:57:55,780 --> 00:58:04,920
you get there I was weak I need to put a

1200
00:58:01,059 --> 00:58:08,219
little more so much I need a little bit

1201
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:08,220
bigger part

1202
00:58:24,099 --> 00:58:32,210
yeah yeah yeah it's really tasty

1203
00:58:28,730 --> 00:58:38,349
I love the puffs go

1204
00:58:32,210 --> 00:58:46,610
that thing's awesome I feel like yeah

1205
00:58:38,349 --> 00:58:52,940
yeah we had this thing in Pebble Beach

1206
00:58:46,610 --> 00:58:57,650
is awesome you're getting when you took

1207
00:58:52,940 --> 00:59:08,619
the selfie in front of Tiger Woods and

1208
00:58:57,650 --> 00:59:08,619
we enjoins to I'm sure Tiger Woods time

1209
00:59:11,710 --> 00:59:17,769
it both great it's a similar concept

1210
00:59:13,909 --> 00:59:17,769
yeah it's almost the same thing

1211
00:59:21,510 --> 00:59:25,099
I was actually in balance

1212
00:59:27,210 --> 00:59:35,030
well the puff co felt more like a dabit

1213
00:59:29,550 --> 00:59:35,030
yeah you get us is the crew tapping out

1214
00:59:44,659 --> 00:59:50,789
mm-hmm and then pulled into stage screen

1215
00:59:48,389 --> 00:59:52,289
so it'll flash green a few times so you

1216
00:59:50,789 --> 00:59:58,139
got a hold on the up on the top will see

1217
00:59:52,289 --> 01:00:00,269
yeah very top and then yeah if they give

1218
00:59:58,139 --> 01:00:05,578
it like ten seconds oh yeah wait a

1219
01:00:00,269 --> 01:00:07,139
little bit just buzzed again yeah that

1220
01:00:05,579 --> 01:00:13,050
feels more like a dab experience that

1221
01:00:07,139 --> 01:00:16,348
it's Alegria you're good that's what

1222
01:00:13,050 --> 01:00:17,609
yeah when this thing is really ripping

1223
01:00:16,349 --> 01:00:20,609
it feels too good

1224
01:00:17,608 --> 01:00:23,759
like a fold dad yeah for sure

1225
01:00:20,608 --> 01:00:28,009
this is this is nice absolutely this

1226
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:28,010
makes a little bit more more modest

1227
01:00:33,559 --> 01:00:38,130
although this thing travels really well

1228
01:00:35,548 --> 01:00:39,568
to it come this little box is perfect

1229
01:00:38,130 --> 01:00:40,980
you know I claim it for a little water

1230
01:00:39,568 --> 01:00:44,608
in it you know I got problems

1231
01:00:40,980 --> 01:00:46,889
yeah it could be easier like yeah you're

1232
01:00:44,608 --> 01:00:48,298
not whipping out then or nothing like

1233
01:00:46,889 --> 01:00:50,730
that and you can sit there if they bring

1234
01:00:48,298 --> 01:00:53,699
it everywhere murders traveling where

1235
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:55,440
they don't even those that is yeah let's

1236
01:00:53,699 --> 01:00:57,088

1237
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:59,369

1241
01:01:04,650 --> 01:01:08,519

1243
