1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,740
I had a company back in the 90s I opened

2
00:00:08,669 --> 00:00:13,259
one of the first temp companies in 1990

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,580
and we started making hats wallets and

4
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:17,429
bags i think i'm going to told you that

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:21,089
and then i started the hie a hemp

6
00:00:17,429 --> 00:00:22,829
industries association in 1992 we saw

7
00:00:21,089 --> 00:00:24,899
her a bunch of hemp companies open up

8
00:00:22,829 --> 00:00:27,059
they were making hemp clothing and foods

9
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:29,368
so we decided to have an industry

10
00:00:27,059 --> 00:00:33,089
organization that we could Lobby and

11
00:00:29,368 --> 00:00:36,600
further you know open up you know the

12
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:39,989
hemp industry for America and then in

13
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:42,149
1994 I grew a field of hemp at the USDA

14
00:00:39,988 --> 00:00:44,669
research facility in an imperial valley

15
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:48,570
california and that was a historic

16
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:50,700
moment in time 1994 you know on federal

17
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:53,628
property growing you know half a million

18
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:58,640
plants you know over an acre of hemp and

19
00:00:53,628 --> 00:00:58,640
that was quite a milestone

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,450
this field you see behind me here is a

21
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:10,359
hempfield location you're looking at in

22
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:12,850
raleigh california this is an historical

23
00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:14,978
moment this is the first hempfield to be

24
00:01:12,849 --> 00:01:17,259
grown legally in america in over 30

25
00:01:14,978 --> 00:01:20,579
years what we're doing here is an

26
00:01:17,259 --> 00:01:22,719
experiment to enhance the fiber

27
00:01:20,579 --> 00:01:25,359
agricultural industry and also the seed

28
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:29,048
oil industry and create jobs at the same

29
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:31,810
time these fields are strictly for data

30
00:01:29,049 --> 00:01:35,350
research I was convinced within two or

31
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:38,379
three years hemp would be legal it took

32
00:01:35,349 --> 00:01:41,678
20 years it wasn't until 2014 our goal

33
00:01:38,379 --> 00:01:43,780
was to research hemp farming here in

34
00:01:41,679 --> 00:01:46,450
California and determine how much a

35
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:48,819
farmer could make per acre you know what

36
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:50,829
would the yields be of the fiber how

37
00:01:48,819 --> 00:01:53,829
many pounds of seed per acre there'd be

38
00:01:50,829 --> 00:01:55,810
able to get what the prices were and

39
00:01:53,829 --> 00:01:57,579
what the distribution model but more

40
00:01:55,810 --> 00:02:00,490
importantly what it would cost the

41
00:01:57,579 --> 00:02:02,978
farmer to grow we found out that the

42
00:02:00,489 --> 00:02:05,890
average farmer could make three times

43
00:02:02,978 --> 00:02:07,239
more than he was making for corn make

44
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:10,090
more than he was growing for cotton and

45
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:13,719
so when people start looking at the the

46
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:17,110
data from this research project you know

47
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:18,870
it was incredible and so you know it's

48
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:21,849
taken you know 20 years of lobbying

49
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:24,879
legislation and education of the people

50
00:02:21,848 --> 00:02:26,649
to grow hemp again in this country the

51
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:28,199
world has a monopoly on United States

52
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:30,400
United States is the only country

53
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:32,738
probably in the free world that doesn't

54
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,719
grow him I mean the English grow at the

55
00:02:32,739 --> 00:02:37,269
French grow it the Chinese draw it the

56
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:39,939
Russians grow it I mean I can go on and

57
00:02:37,269 --> 00:02:42,280
on and America we just started growing

58
00:02:39,939 --> 00:02:43,780
it last year at research you need a DEA

59
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,939
license so it's really restrictive

60
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:48,550
currently the Canadians control most of

61
00:02:45,939 --> 00:02:51,370
the food market and the Europeans

62
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:53,680
control most of the the CBD market and

63
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:55,750
the Chinese control most of the textile

64
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,950
market so you have these dynamics set up

65
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:59,408
but I think in the next three to five

66
00:02:56,949 --> 00:03:02,649
years if we can you know re kick-start

67
00:02:59,408 --> 00:03:05,109
this American hemp you know economic

68
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:07,659
model I think we'll see American

69
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:09,400
global leader in have products and

70
00:03:07,659 --> 00:03:12,520
cannabis will be leading the way it's

71
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:14,680
going to revitalize rural communities

72
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:16,719
here in America you know we have a lot

73
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,740
of rural farming communities and a lot

74
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:20,530
of them have been hit really hard

75
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:22,030
especially your family farms and this

76
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:23,650
country was you know found on an

77
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:26,110
agriculture you know we were a

78
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:27,819
carbohydrate based economy you know

79
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:31,180
we've switched over now to a petroleum

80
00:03:27,819 --> 00:03:34,689
based economy and if we can go back to

81
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:37,180
that original you know eco economical

82
00:03:34,689 --> 00:03:38,500
business model of being able to build

83
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:40,930
infrastructure in these rural

84
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:45,580
communities build these hemp processing

85
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:49,659
factories for seed oil for fiber for CBD

86
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:51,420
for CBG and we can pay the farmer ten

87
00:03:49,659 --> 00:03:54,340
times more than he's getting for cotton

88
00:03:51,419 --> 00:03:56,500
10 times morning's getting for corn a

89
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:59,170
matter of fact in Kentucky this year a

90
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:01,750
couple of the farmers from the research

91
00:03:59,169 --> 00:04:03,609
they're determined that they made three

92
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:07,360
times more than they did for tobacco and

93
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:10,150
ten times when they did for porn so

94
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,190
taking those numbers I mean economically

95
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:13,959
speaking what would it do for these

96
00:04:12,189 --> 00:04:16,358
communities would really enhance them

97
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:17,970
and create jobs and build factories and

98
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:21,430
I think that's what we need to do

99
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:25,120
kickstart the o hemp industry which

100
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:27,310
would revitalize family farms in

101
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:30,340
American agriculture it's considered

102
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:33,069
legalized in Kentucky and the reason

103
00:04:30,339 --> 00:04:35,909
being is the Department of Agriculture

104
00:04:33,069 --> 00:04:38,199
has contracted with local farmers and

105
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:40,240
Kentucky Department yeah the Kentucky

106
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:44,589
Department and so part of the research

107
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:46,960
not just in yields and you know tonnage

108
00:04:44,589 --> 00:04:49,149
per acre the research and sales and

109
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:52,269
marketing you know can you make a

110
00:04:49,149 --> 00:04:55,209
finished product from your farm and sell

111
00:04:52,269 --> 00:04:57,819
it in the American economy so that's

112
00:04:55,209 --> 00:05:00,909
research and development and so research

113
00:04:57,819 --> 00:05:02,769
of the sales and marketing shipping how

114
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:06,370
much in a caution is ship it you know

115
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:08,680
what was your customer base so the

116
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:13,149
legislation in Kentucky even the United

117
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:15,879
States is basically makes it legal in

118
00:05:13,149 --> 00:05:18,098
that sense and you're allowed to receive

119
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:18,719
money in profits for your research and

120
00:05:18,098 --> 00:05:20,729
developments

121
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,340
so Kentucky is still in the research

122
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:26,069
phase what's the next stage for Kentucky

123
00:05:23,339 --> 00:05:29,069
and are they going yeah the next stage

124
00:05:26,069 --> 00:05:34,259
would be for full-scale commercial

125
00:05:29,069 --> 00:05:38,779
operations probably next year the year

126
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:41,550
after so I mean technically next year if

127
00:05:38,779 --> 00:05:44,099
you had the money you could grow 10,000

128
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:45,329
acres in Kentucky as long as you checked

129
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:47,970
out okay with the Department of

130
00:05:45,329 --> 00:05:52,139
Agriculture and they would issue you a

131
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:56,490
MoU and once you had that MOU you would

132
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:59,639
basically be doing your research for

133
00:05:56,490 --> 00:06:03,090
sales marketing growing the whole whole

134
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:05,219
deal so could put that so hypothetically

135
00:06:03,089 --> 00:06:07,009
a year from now a Kentucky farmer can

136
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:10,590
legally grow industrial or agricultural

137
00:06:07,009 --> 00:06:13,769
hemp and he then sell the finish cared

138
00:06:10,589 --> 00:06:15,779
whether it's seeds or Mao currently

139
00:06:13,769 --> 00:06:18,180
right now they can sell anything that

140
00:06:15,779 --> 00:06:20,939
plant produces so within the federal law

141
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:23,759
if you read the definition of what's

142
00:06:20,939 --> 00:06:27,870
legal there's the word a and why any

143
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:30,029
part of the plants so you know my

144
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:33,649
interpretation of any means everything

145
00:06:30,029 --> 00:06:37,289
on the plants as long as a THC level is

146
00:06:33,649 --> 00:06:39,389
0.3% CBD level could be ten percent it

147
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:41,850
could be two percent you know so and

148
00:06:39,389 --> 00:06:44,819
you're you're getting so much investment

149
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:47,280
moving into Kentucky right now it's

150
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:49,199
amazing so we'll see what happens this

151
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:50,459
year in order for it to be research and

152
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,168
development of the sales and marketing

153
00:06:50,459 --> 00:06:54,659
you'd have to be up to ship to all 50

154
00:06:52,168 --> 00:06:55,978
states so you're allowed if you grow it

155
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:59,910
in Kentucky you could ship to alaska

156
00:06:55,978 --> 00:07:02,909
florida main nebraska one hundred

157
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:05,400
percent legal and you see sort of a race

158
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:08,580
among states that realize that economic

159
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:10,199
impact this crop could have to legalize

160
00:07:08,579 --> 00:07:11,789
different like Kentucky you're talking

161
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:13,680
about Kentucky's a different situation

162
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:16,710
you have the political will power there

163
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:19,079
you have politicians that are willing to

164
00:07:16,709 --> 00:07:21,659
fight the DEA they're willing to fight

165
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:24,319
the federal government in order to let

166
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:27,660
their farmers grow they don't they don't

167
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:30,360
scare very easy so most politicians in

168
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:32,280
my 25 years in the business once they

169
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:35,670
started moving forward with you know

170
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:37,859
legislation or hemp legalization you had

171
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:39,319
law enforcement you had DEA come and

172
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:42,060
visit them and they completely shut down

173
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:43,469
these are the only people in the last 25

174
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:47,430
years that I've seen that didn't back

175
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:48,570
down from law enforcement DEA and the

176
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:50,668
federal government they said we have a

177
00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:54,569
right to grow here's the law you do not

178
00:07:50,668 --> 00:07:57,000
scare us and we will not you know except

179
00:07:54,569 --> 00:08:00,449
your threats even the university's when

180
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,100
it was legal the DEA threatened to pull

181
00:08:00,449 --> 00:08:05,219
all their federal funding for the entire

182
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:08,010
school and so the politicians McConnell

183
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:10,140
Rand Paul representative Massie they

184
00:08:08,009 --> 00:08:12,629
stepped in and said you can't do this

185
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:15,899
that's a threat so you know I don't want

186
00:08:12,629 --> 00:08:17,610
to get political but you know cuenta de

187
00:08:15,899 --> 00:08:20,250
federal government then back down on

188
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:22,949
that threat oh yes because they had

189
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:24,839
politicians that wouldn't back down so

190
00:08:22,949 --> 00:08:27,120
what I was trying to say was in my 25

191
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:29,579
years every politician I've ever dealt

192
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:32,820
with has always backed down when the DEA

193
00:08:29,579 --> 00:08:35,309
threatens them so that this was just the

194
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:37,260
way it had to be done farmers don't have

195
00:08:35,309 --> 00:08:38,879
to go through the DEA to get their seeds

196
00:08:37,259 --> 00:08:40,529
you know they should be able to buy

197
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:44,038
their seeds like you buy corn seeds

198
00:08:40,529 --> 00:08:45,990
soybean seeds you know so you know as

199
00:08:44,038 --> 00:08:48,299
that changes as we move forward you know

200
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:51,330
and Kentucky Colorado is doing the same

201
00:08:48,299 --> 00:08:54,389
thing you have Tennessee that's growing

202
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:56,220
but again you know the momentum in

203
00:08:54,389 --> 00:08:58,649
Kentucky is like nothing I've seen in 25

204
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:01,470
years right but so notice we need like

205
00:08:58,649 --> 00:09:05,250
the three leading states Kentucky

206
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:06,509
Colorado than Tennessee for AG hemp well

207
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:08,070
if you look at Kentucky its unique

208
00:09:06,509 --> 00:09:11,850
situation you have all the coal mines

209
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:14,720
shut down you know you know mountaintop

210
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:17,639
removal is not happening anymore and so

211
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,200
the economy was based upon cold so

212
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:20,519
you've got unemployment rates somewhere

213
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:24,480
in the twenty percent in some counties

214
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:26,399
and then you taken the factor of tobacco

215
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,519
these guys are all the tobacco growers

216
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:31,549
and all those subsidies were gone

217
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:33,250
you know you know all these factors so

218
00:09:31,549 --> 00:09:36,289
you have really high unemployment rate

219
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:38,629
farming's down and this would supplement

220
00:09:36,289 --> 00:09:40,639
these communities that would really help

221
00:09:38,629 --> 00:09:43,240
the state yeah there's a lot of other

222
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:46,240
states or the same position but

223
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:46,240
specifically
