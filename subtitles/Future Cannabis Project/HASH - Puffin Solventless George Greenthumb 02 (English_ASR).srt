1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,449
I mean who's gonna be my first time

2
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:14,429
using it let's heat it up we'll start

3
00:00:12,449 --> 00:00:16,349
low that way he can do a press and we'll

4
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:18,990
bump the temp up for him

5
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:22,439
I did bring some material it has I

6
00:00:18,989 --> 00:00:23,820
didn't bring my apologize we've got some

7
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:30,329
here you can press them of ours because

8
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:31,800
I'd like let me go those are for a

9
00:00:30,329 --> 00:00:32,189
cottonmouth and they'd work very very

10
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,660
well

11
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:36,090
they're from See's candy and you know

12
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:38,578
what this is cool and if users like to

13
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:42,570
sponsor me at any point I've never seen

14
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:45,210
impressed my wash I've pressed other

15
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:47,640
people's washes and I don't I don't

16
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:53,039
prefer that I don't prefer wash you know

17
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:57,299
pressing up so this is gonna be fun

18
00:00:53,039 --> 00:01:00,989
because number one I've never used this

19
00:00:57,299 --> 00:01:02,939
machine number one right right using a

20
00:01:00,988 --> 00:01:05,069
new press is like driving somebody's car

21
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:07,319
else's car it's beyond driving someone

22
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:09,408
else's yeah so this particular situation

23
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:12,118
I have feel the same way I'm like okay

24
00:01:09,409 --> 00:01:14,159
how does it ever even provide a plate so

25
00:01:12,118 --> 00:01:17,790
small what makes it move it's a manual

26
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:19,890
perfect okay yeah manual I love that

27
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:22,020
it's when it's a hydraulic press is when

28
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:23,849
I have to dial it because yeah you you

29
00:01:22,019 --> 00:01:26,099
have to learn what it wants to do and

30
00:01:23,849 --> 00:01:28,109
how to control it where now it's your

31
00:01:26,099 --> 00:01:32,269
fingers so that's great so one cuz you

32
00:01:28,109 --> 00:01:33,509
logged I am alright yeah this heater up

33
00:01:32,269 --> 00:01:35,609
yeah

34
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:39,228
or bringing it back that way light one

35
00:01:35,609 --> 00:01:42,469
or so yeah that's manageable and then

36
00:01:39,228 --> 00:01:44,429
this top and bottom so it's basic simple

37
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:45,899
yeah it looks like you're just heating

38
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:49,970
it now we just got to see how it

39
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:53,159
performs with the material that I have

40
00:01:49,969 --> 00:02:00,000
no no that should be plenty so in the

41
00:01:53,159 --> 00:02:01,950
meantime I'm gonna you have gloves sweet

42
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,438
you can even go a little further if you

43
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:06,439
want well I gotta break this hash up

44
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:21,849
now this hash is not in your ideal

45
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:25,299
environment it's not in a freezer it has

46
00:02:21,848 --> 00:02:31,268
actually already gummed up so more than

47
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:35,560
likely yes and I'm okay with it good

48
00:02:31,269 --> 00:02:38,709
hash and gonna come out it's all in the

49
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:42,580
how well did you wash it is what it

50
00:02:38,709 --> 00:02:45,430
comes down to because I I can really

51
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:51,610
mess up this wash if I don't pay

52
00:02:45,430 --> 00:03:01,450
attention to it so I use a flux rosin

53
00:02:51,610 --> 00:03:05,860
press yeah it's huge I I think I have a

54
00:03:01,449 --> 00:03:10,469
couple of presses my preference okay my

55
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:15,430
my first press I got was made by CRD Inc

56
00:03:10,469 --> 00:03:17,169
they're out of Ventura and that was like

57
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:19,329
if you go to like the very bottom of his

58
00:03:17,169 --> 00:03:22,059
page I got like one of the first one or

59
00:03:19,329 --> 00:03:24,250
two that he made and that thing was a

60
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:25,420
workhorse I pressed a lot of rosin out

61
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:28,799
of that you'll see a lot of my big

62
00:03:25,419 --> 00:03:33,369
waterfalls were on that press and then

63
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:36,909
the real I og gifted us the Sasquatch v1

64
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:39,069
that's what Iraq the it's a v2 but it's

65
00:03:36,909 --> 00:03:41,709
so old that it doesn't have an OPA back

66
00:03:39,068 --> 00:03:45,608
like the back is like plated off

67
00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:47,500
I know over like the v1 it sucks like if

68
00:03:45,609 --> 00:03:49,420
you blow out a bag you almost have to

69
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:52,989
take it all apart to be able to clean

70
00:03:49,419 --> 00:03:55,599
behind it there was no they're super

71
00:03:52,989 --> 00:04:01,810
gnarly dude they're heavy as hell so and

72
00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:04,090
then with just not wanting to buy the

73
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:06,039
same presses that I've already got big

74
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:09,189
plates I decided to go with the Razzak

75
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:12,669
technologies which is a tiny little like

76
00:04:09,189 --> 00:04:15,969
this is the pup I'll show you this is

77
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:18,728
the puck you know I do 4 gram pucks so

78
00:04:15,969 --> 00:04:21,410
this is a puck maker alright but I press

79
00:04:18,728 --> 00:04:23,449
4 grams you know that allows me to do a

80
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:25,939
like you know there's more material

81
00:04:23,449 --> 00:04:27,979
you're pressing them the longer you have

82
00:04:25,939 --> 00:04:29,980
to press it it's just more material to

83
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:35,330
heat it up don't heat it up on this too

84
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:37,970
we have parchment paper there's some

85
00:04:35,329 --> 00:04:39,740
paper tada

86
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:53,420
and it came with it look at it matches

87
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:57,680
the company we're gonna press some Mac

88
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:59,720
one by la family farms they're the 90

89
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,490
you whoa we just smoked that was good by

90
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:03,770
the way it was really good and it's cool

91
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:05,629
to smoke somebody else's Mac like

92
00:05:03,769 --> 00:05:07,699
they're always very similar but they're

93
00:05:05,629 --> 00:05:09,949
also different because everyone uses a

94
00:05:07,699 --> 00:05:14,209
different rollers you know different

95
00:05:09,949 --> 00:05:16,930
techniques to grow so that guy's saying

96
00:05:14,209 --> 00:05:19,279
this is the night of you it's gummed up

97
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:21,829
there's a couple of ways to deal with it

98
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:25,429
no matter what in my opinion it's still

99
00:05:21,829 --> 00:05:28,099
gonna press the same not only just order

100
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:31,160
to get in the bag to say no just because

101
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:32,990
you know your material gums up doesn't

102
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,760
mean it's gonna be fired because there

103
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:43,960
could be contaminants in there you know

104
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:45,789
so don't want this car know that for you

105
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:48,829
just hold it

106
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:51,189
yeah I can hold the camera for you if

107
00:05:48,829 --> 00:05:51,189
you want

108
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:46,860
that's that great stopper not always the

109
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:50,729
funnest sorry I normally have all this

110
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:59,970
work prep but it's gonna take a minute

111
00:06:50,728 --> 00:07:00,620
here I'll prep mine might as well right

112
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:03,150
yeah

113
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:04,680
is that cool you really don't mind jump

114
00:07:03,149 --> 00:07:05,969
in there brother let's do that I want to

115
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,639
see as long as you're ok with it

116
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:16,560
I'm having a little bit like an excited

117
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:28,649
sergeants participate but the puffs go

118
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:30,449
peak get a quartz banger and something

119
00:07:28,649 --> 00:07:36,620
that Jolly Roger won't like me to talk

120
00:07:30,449 --> 00:07:40,740
about is get a get the puff Co rebuilt

121
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:42,750
it's called puff coil repair and your

122
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:45,288
atomizer will actually burn hotter and

123
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:48,329
better and use the same amount of

124
00:07:45,288 --> 00:07:52,199
battery life it's the same ohms it's

125
00:07:48,329 --> 00:07:53,609
just a better wiring so it actually just

126
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:56,569
conducts heat better

127
00:07:53,610 --> 00:08:02,310
[Applause]

128
00:07:56,569 --> 00:08:03,899
you can get online puff coil repair and

129
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:10,230
it's cheap too it's like 70 bucks and

130
00:08:03,899 --> 00:08:12,659
you get like 10 of them nope

131
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:15,750
you know what's happening we need it we

132
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:19,439

I always like something sweet you know

164
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:14,370
I'm just not all drink socially yeah

165
00:10:12,629 --> 00:10:17,129
yeah I go to the bar with like a friend

166
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:18,810
or whatever but I don't even have I

167
00:10:17,129 --> 00:10:21,740
don't even have a booze at my house

168
00:10:18,809 --> 00:10:22,859
yeah just fussy that's more like like a

169
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:24,149
preference

170
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:28,139
yeah preference thing and that's nothing

171
00:10:24,149 --> 00:10:29,730
to do with like getting drunk or fussy I

172
00:10:28,139 --> 00:10:34,350
just don't think it tastes good I just

173
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:37,740
think they all taste terrible don't have

174
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:40,379
to like everything yeah but yeah we're

175
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:43,169
gonna do a ten grand putt let's do that

176
00:10:40,379 --> 00:10:50,338
I think I could probably get like eight

177
00:10:43,169 --> 00:10:52,110
in here fold it good you have an extra

178
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:55,320
set of gloves I could steal yeah well

179
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:57,419
this is not my typical way of doing

180
00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:01,890
things I'll wait by the way we are on

181
00:10:57,419 --> 00:11:04,019
the fly so if you yeah mine would be

182
00:11:01,889 --> 00:11:05,549
like all fluffy and coldest if did but

183
00:11:04,019 --> 00:11:07,049
it's definitely gonna work yeah we're

184
00:11:05,549 --> 00:11:07,588
gonna still do it it's gonna be

185
00:11:07,049 --> 00:11:13,679
different

186
00:11:07,589 --> 00:11:15,839
oh don't mind if I do and I'm most

187
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:18,120
likely gonna end up going to about three

188
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,290
minutes on this press oh we should

189
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:23,970
probably you know what we should do we

190
00:11:19,289 --> 00:11:26,189
should turn on the press and a little

191
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:28,759
tip for the newbies put the plates

192
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:31,020
together it'll heat up faster and even

193
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:34,500
so they're both get to the same tent the

194
00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:39,480
same time it's not too tight just

195
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:42,299
together touch them yep ooh we got

196
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:47,550
Celsius to girl get the calculator

197
00:11:42,299 --> 00:11:50,278
Google what's it set up in my freezer

198
00:11:47,549 --> 00:11:51,240
okay I made my own cool bot okay I don't

199
00:11:50,278 --> 00:11:53,009
know if you know what the cool bot is

200
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:57,269
for hash makers cool bot is what makes

201
00:11:53,009 --> 00:12:00,330
your regular wall a/c your mini split

202
00:11:57,269 --> 00:12:02,189
any splits go below 60 degrees you could

203
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:03,900
take it down to 34 degrees however that

204
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:05,820
little device is like three four and a

205
00:12:03,899 --> 00:12:07,730
buck so I've made mine for like yeah I

206
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:10,709
made mine for like thirty bucks

207
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:12,209
however listen to this folks if he's

208
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:16,679
giving you information like this you

209
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:19,979
guys benefit that that controls the on

210
00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:21,809
and off of heating the thermostat to

211
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:24,909
trick it into thinking that the room is

212
00:12:21,809 --> 00:12:26,799
boundaries and the device that monitors

213
00:12:24,909 --> 00:12:29,079
the temperature my coil to make sure

214
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:29,829
that the coil doesn't freeze Ami's is in

215
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:33,340
Celsius

216
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:34,840
so I hate Celsius only because I don't

217
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:36,940
understand it that's the only thing

218
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:38,710
anytime I say I don't like nothing is

219
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:40,900
because I don't understand it and it's

220
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:46,780
just being lazy of not taking the time

221
00:12:40,899 --> 00:12:48,909
to learn what Celsius converts to so so

222
00:12:46,779 --> 00:12:51,939
no I just get a cell phone

223
00:12:48,909 --> 00:12:54,069
I just got additional thermostat thermal

224
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:56,170
copeland with the little line and i just

225
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:58,870
tap those and those read fahrenheit

226
00:12:56,169 --> 00:13:01,539
right above the celsius but now I got

227
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:03,759
two temperature sensors ones in Celsius

228
00:13:01,539 --> 00:13:05,919
ones in Fahrenheit the fahrenheits just

229
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:07,509
for me cuz I'm too damn already you're

230
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:09,389
just using it as literally like those

231
00:13:07,509 --> 00:13:12,850
are that's an extra 10 bucks

232
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:14,409
it cost me so I can just look at it and

233
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:16,720
know what the you know the temperature

234
00:13:14,409 --> 00:13:18,969
is because I I have other equipment that

235
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,800
is in Celsius and I got a cheat sheet of

236
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:26,230
all the temperature conversions on the

237
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:28,209
side in the story

238
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:30,519
learned Celsius you don't need to spend

239
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:35,950
on extra ten books it goes down pretty

240
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:38,379
quick just FYI it was set at 200 do you

241
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:41,170
want me to lower it to 180 oh yeah

242
00:13:38,379 --> 00:13:44,980
please 180 go one eight nine once every

243
00:13:41,169 --> 00:13:48,459
night I do that because it's I don't

244
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:50,830
know it's not 180 but but when people

245
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:52,180
say what do you press that I say 180 so

246
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:55,270
it's weird because it's like too many

247
00:13:52,179 --> 00:13:59,409
little numbers to say so it's like 179

248
00:13:55,269 --> 00:14:03,840
or 180 so but I set it at 179 and it's

249
00:13:59,409 --> 00:14:03,839
you're gonna see it's gonna be 180 181

250
00:14:04,529 --> 00:14:11,909
behringer so like like I set mine to 224

251
00:14:07,419 --> 00:14:11,909
and it's usually always says 225 so

252
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:20,019
alright it's already at 157 it says but

253
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:22,120
I would still let it this is what it's

254
00:14:20,019 --> 00:14:24,009
going up to the 35 I have no idea I

255
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:27,070
think it's like a second thing like a I

256
00:14:24,009 --> 00:14:29,409
don't know what this 35 is I don't have

257
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:32,160
like a manual for this thing I've never

258
00:14:29,409 --> 00:14:32,159
ran this company

259
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:38,260
I think it has something to do with this

260
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:40,600
timer because it says 35s like seconds

261
00:14:38,259 --> 00:14:44,230
is what move it no huh but I didn't hit

262
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:47,709
the timer yet let's see oh yeah see 34

263
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:49,720
oh is that a built-in timer okay what is

264
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:54,609
that doing it felt like it sounded like

265
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:56,560
something else turned on this little

266
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:59,740
light came on - do we have an

267
00:14:56,559 --> 00:15:03,250
instruction now my chance no cheatsheet

268
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:13,089
I think it's just a timer it's just a

269
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:14,948
time book maybe huh oh yeah check it out

270
00:15:13,089 --> 00:15:18,730
what wow that did heat up pretty quick

271
00:15:14,948 --> 00:15:35,919
that one yep that's it what is the 35s

272
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:37,420
mean evolution I'm a big fan of a lot of

273
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:40,448
their material

274
00:15:37,419 --> 00:15:44,289
I like their bags they're affordable

275
00:15:40,448 --> 00:15:46,479
number one number two they work there's

276
00:15:44,289 --> 00:15:50,379
other affordable options out there that

277
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:52,240
don't work so that's why I like their

278
00:15:50,379 --> 00:15:54,159
bags therefore I use rosin evolution

279
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:58,329
always I just switched over literally

280
00:15:54,159 --> 00:16:00,600
today I press my first press with rosin

281
00:15:58,328 --> 00:16:04,419
new ink

282
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:08,170
now I don't have my one ton arbor press

283
00:16:04,419 --> 00:16:12,309
that I would normally close this with to

284
00:16:08,169 --> 00:16:17,019
get a puck so I'm gonna use my 165

285
00:16:12,309 --> 00:16:22,028
pounds or whatever I can to press this

286
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:24,339
puck makes me want to do the old-school

287
00:16:22,028 --> 00:16:26,220
shoe hash you know like step on it

288
00:16:24,339 --> 00:16:28,300
remember that you guys never should have

289
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:29,560
put it in your shoe and walk around for

290
00:16:28,299 --> 00:16:36,129
a while hell yeah that should be all

291
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:38,309
gummy people don't know that back in the

292
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:38,309
day

293
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:51,720
it speeds up the process minimize your

294
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:55,170
mistakes when you're working with hash

295
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:58,440
it's too it's too precious to make

296
00:16:55,169 --> 00:17:07,170
mistakes oh so that's how I see it I'm

297
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:09,990
not trying to just waste material you

298
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:12,410
work so hard yeah it's bullshit it's

299
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:16,019
very just self-explanatory

300
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:18,089
it says thank you for purchasing it's

301
00:17:16,019 --> 00:17:24,740
about the same amount of info you get

302
00:17:18,088 --> 00:17:27,509
from rosin or from harvest right yeah I

303
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:33,240
can just set this time for the amount of

304
00:17:27,509 --> 00:17:37,500
time that he wants to press set the time

305
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:42,539
35 we're gonna do three I have a timer

306
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:44,880
you can do it right on here just let's

307
00:17:42,539 --> 00:17:47,369
use their gear then right yeah so when

308
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,400
I'm ready to hit it I just hit it yeah

309
00:17:47,369 --> 00:17:52,709
you literally just hit timer yeah okay

310
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:55,410
so now it's set to 180 seconds so this

311
00:17:52,710 --> 00:18:00,090
is our little snack puck that we just

312
00:17:55,410 --> 00:18:01,558
made okay so it's still gonna go good

313
00:18:00,089 --> 00:18:03,299
see that's what I'm like it's still good

314
00:18:01,558 --> 00:18:16,410
material you know it's still gonna do

315
00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:19,529
its thing well it's for the top band the

316
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:22,500
bottom plate yeah I don't know why I

317
00:18:19,529 --> 00:18:25,019
would do that why you would need to but

318
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:27,679
it's weird yeah it's weird though when

319
00:18:25,019 --> 00:18:29,940
you do click the timer button like watch

320
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:32,179
like something something something's

321
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:36,470
clicking I don't know if it's just a

322
00:18:32,179 --> 00:18:36,470
diode in there causing this

323

386
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:22,190
stand-up paddling like this specifically

387
00:22:18,579 --> 00:22:27,859
almost a year like specifically but I've

388
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:29,179
been making hash for 10-15 years growing

389
00:22:27,859 --> 00:22:33,769
for 10-15 years

390
00:22:29,179 --> 00:22:36,019
so making good high-quality hash rosin

391
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:38,240
and properly with a rosin press and

392
00:22:36,019 --> 00:22:40,220
learning the techniques and figuring

393
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:45,609
this whole thing out and trying to brand

394
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:48,769
it and and have people like what I do I

395
00:22:45,609 --> 00:22:59,599
was just making either BHO working in

396
00:22:48,769 --> 00:23:02,750
labs you know making pens no because I

397
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:05,148
mean I mean I'm doing the best I can

398
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:06,500
with what I got so but there are people

399
00:23:05,148 --> 00:23:08,418
that are like bothering me for these

400
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:09,859
massive orders from like up north that I

401
00:23:08,419 --> 00:23:11,870
don't even know who they are I'm like I

402
00:23:09,859 --> 00:23:13,819
can't provide you with like stuff I

403
00:23:11,869 --> 00:23:15,768
first of all don't even have that sort

404
00:23:13,819 --> 00:23:18,769
of quantity on hand I'm very I'm very

405
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:21,528
small batch and very like by myself I'm

406
00:23:18,769 --> 00:23:22,759
you know so but they're just seeing the

407
00:23:21,528 --> 00:23:24,740
quality that's coming out and it's like

408
00:23:22,759 --> 00:23:25,940
well that's because I am so small you

409
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:27,919
know if I really tried to do this on a

410
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:30,590
grand mass scale I believe that the

411
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:33,200
quality would hinder a bit you know

412
00:23:30,589 --> 00:23:35,298
cause if I feel like I'm not doing it

413
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,649
personally there's there's not too many

414
00:23:35,298 --> 00:23:39,908
people are out there that are gonna be

415
00:23:36,648 --> 00:23:42,018
as anal and and up to my specifications

416
00:23:39,909 --> 00:23:43,970
they could give it up to some of the big

417
00:23:42,019 --> 00:23:45,380
companies like 7/10 labs and stuff like

418
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:47,509
that that are out there just pumping out

419
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:49,610
so much consists in quality hash you

420
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:51,919
like the bro good on you guys you must

421
00:23:49,609 --> 00:23:53,609
have a good crew because it's hard to

422
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:56,759
trust a lot of people to to be

423
00:23:53,609 --> 00:23:58,168
careful with your product like takes so

424
00:23:56,759 --> 00:24:02,399
much time just to grow the wheat itself

425
00:23:58,169 --> 00:24:06,570
let alone process the hash making like

426
00:24:02,398 --> 00:24:09,928
every time I take on a new farmer it's

427
00:24:06,569 --> 00:24:13,168
it's it's scary and literally like I get

428
00:24:09,929 --> 00:24:16,230
nervous I get concerned that I'm gonna

429
00:24:13,169 --> 00:24:19,619
I'm gonna fuck it up oh yeah that's my

430
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:22,558
biggest fear is having to explain to

431
00:24:19,618 --> 00:24:25,319
them that I fucked up you know and then

432
00:24:22,558 --> 00:24:26,038
a lot of times I used to think that it

433
00:24:25,319 --> 00:24:28,138
was me

434
00:24:26,038 --> 00:24:29,878
sometimes it's them and they provided

435
00:24:28,138 --> 00:24:32,069
you with a shit product and then it's

436
00:24:29,878 --> 00:24:34,469
another and then another headache that

437
00:24:32,069 --> 00:24:40,408
you have to go talk to that about like I

438
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:41,909
did not you know and I'm not the kind of

439
00:24:40,409 --> 00:24:43,739
I'm not I'm not the kind of guy that

440
00:24:41,909 --> 00:24:46,409
wants to bring Brad news I don't I know

441
00:24:43,739 --> 00:24:48,538
I want I want I'm sorry I want to come

442
00:24:46,409 --> 00:24:51,090
back and be like look what the stuff you

443
00:24:48,538 --> 00:24:54,028
did I want to polish what you made you

444
00:24:51,089 --> 00:24:56,939
know and and unfortunately the biggest

445
00:24:54,028 --> 00:24:58,349
thing is you know so I'll usually be

446
00:24:56,940 --> 00:25:00,600
like you know what this is gonna be

447
00:24:58,349 --> 00:25:03,238
better off like diamonds or BHO

448
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:04,798
processed you know that's gonna be make

449
00:25:03,239 --> 00:25:18,509
them straight out I'm like so I was

450
00:25:04,798 --> 00:25:20,429
trying to like you have to have this and

451
00:25:18,509 --> 00:25:26,368
you know how hard it is to get 10 farms

452
00:25:20,429 --> 00:25:27,629
to employee at the farm I'm at yeah yeah

453
00:25:26,368 --> 00:25:30,949
yeah exactly

454
00:25:27,628 --> 00:25:34,648
there hasn't been a farm door I feel

455
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:36,929
confident that I can do the do the work

456
00:25:34,648 --> 00:25:38,638
at the level that I'm able to do I'm

457
00:25:36,929 --> 00:25:41,129
only able to produce this type of

458
00:25:38,638 --> 00:25:42,748
quality because the way they grow yeah

459
00:25:41,128 --> 00:25:45,418
yeah it's it's all about the starting

460
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:47,819
material really why it's like what

461
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:50,179
there's like fine vintages there's like

462
00:25:47,819 --> 00:25:53,878
it's like it's more it's like wine some

463
00:25:50,179 --> 00:25:56,220
some strains and some gears and some

464
00:25:53,878 --> 00:25:59,759
vintages will be better than others and

465
00:25:56,220 --> 00:26:02,009
of course absolutely and that

466
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:06,930
and it's based on the weather that year

467
00:26:02,009 --> 00:26:10,049
yeah so why it is very similar with

468
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:12,810
French Canada like Frenchie yes so has a

469
00:26:10,049 --> 00:26:15,690
very special little hatch and I learned

470
00:26:12,809 --> 00:26:20,700
from Frenchie that was my mentor we met

471
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:23,730
at Frenchy's events like I'm not I'm

472
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:26,549
just expressing what you did yeah I'm

473
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:28,470
just polishing what the farmer did I

474
00:26:26,549 --> 00:26:31,769
can't make their product look better

475
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:34,259
than what it already was I can just sew

476
00:26:31,769 --> 00:26:36,029
oh I'm doing really just makeup up

477
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:38,309
that'll know so it's like if I'll double

478
00:26:36,029 --> 00:26:44,670
bag it and we'll see what we can do this

479
00:26:38,309 --> 00:26:47,309
is 9.35 I believe just over 9 3 I'm just

480
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:49,080
trying to make the best square I can you

481
00:26:47,309 --> 00:26:53,159
want me to pucker you yet again I'll

482
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:55,980
just rock it ok it's good hash I can

483
00:26:53,160 --> 00:27:00,090
tell it's gonna be moldable and work

484
00:26:55,980 --> 00:27:04,680
well yeah I always that I always I

485
00:27:00,089 --> 00:27:07,799
always press and wash and music yeah

486
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:10,560
like I have to like when I wash I have

487
00:27:07,799 --> 00:27:12,779
to have music when I press like I have

488
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:15,359
to have music it's it's it's part of

489
00:27:12,779 --> 00:27:17,009
dude you don't need if you guys can see

490
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:19,500
what I do behind my press when I'm press

491
00:27:17,009 --> 00:27:21,960
I watch a lot of goofy cartoons - I do

492
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:31,099
I dance bro after impressed I fucking do

493
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:38,370
oh it's a good when you're by yourself

494
00:27:31,099 --> 00:27:39,419
get you get excited at least I do I'm

495
00:27:38,369 --> 00:27:41,250
ready I don't know if you try to move

496
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:47,019
the temp though so I'm ready to know

497
00:27:41,250 --> 00:28:16,049
it's at one 180 for you 179 that was ok

498
00:27:47,019 --> 00:28:18,879
have taken me in front of it for heavy

499
00:28:16,049 --> 00:28:20,289
or just some slides over no there we go

500
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:24,030
I just need to get a kneel down so I can

501
00:28:20,289 --> 00:28:38,889
I bother Oh Oh careful check that out

502
00:28:24,029 --> 00:28:39,849
all right where's our timer now let me

503
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:42,400
know when you want to start it it

504
00:28:39,849 --> 00:28:46,119
started now it's just gonna go up right

505
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:48,310
no it's dropping from three minutes 180

506
00:28:46,119 --> 00:28:52,809
seconds oh that's what three minutes is

507
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:58,269
I believe a 60 times three is 180 unless

508
00:28:52,809 --> 00:29:00,519
I'm not good with math and ask Google

509
00:28:58,269 --> 00:29:03,940
oh that rosin tech dude get get that

510
00:29:00,519 --> 00:29:10,420
dude cheap shameless plug by all means

511
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:12,910
I look good down sorry guys did

512
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:14,440
batteries getting low but oh my god

513
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:19,150
these gloves are so small for my hands

514
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:21,509
my fingers are turning now you got fat

515
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:21,509
fingers

516
00:29:23,509 --> 00:29:27,839
so yeah this is a slow process but it's

517
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:34,470
not it that's three minutes we're gonna

518
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:41,039
go like this

519
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:44,460
16 minutes thank you

520
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:46,470
I normally would like lights in there so

521
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:48,870
I wouldn't put yeah I have like a big

522
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:52,440
bright light in here yeah I like to see

523
00:29:48,869 --> 00:29:54,659
what's happening if you take close-up

524
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:56,730
it's starting it's melting break and

525
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:57,090
sway break and sweat see that right

526
00:29:56,730 --> 00:30:05,370
there

527
00:29:57,089 --> 00:30:08,309
we're breaking sweat a little better at

528
00:30:05,369 --> 00:30:10,439
least oh yeah anything now and we can

529
00:30:08,309 --> 00:30:12,419
show them I want to get my fingers full

530
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:14,850
of rosin but we're flowing and now we're

531
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:27,269
taking so I want to flow I don't want

532
00:30:14,849 --> 00:30:37,019
cake yeah it helps to have a stable

533
00:30:27,269 --> 00:30:39,869
table holding the table for you but this

534
00:30:37,019 --> 00:30:41,220
thing yeah I know I saw that you gotta

535
00:30:39,869 --> 00:30:43,079
hold it as I pull that do it if they

536
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:48,470
attack there you go get a little flow

537
00:30:43,079 --> 00:30:48,470
here early in two minutes

538
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:59,779
it's a dramatic picture the three of us

539
00:30:57,259 --> 00:31:01,970
each performing a very specific yes all

540
00:30:59,779 --> 00:31:02,629
important very important everything

541
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:05,960
matters

542
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:08,270
it's flown look great color great color

543
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:11,410
this could get better drop your childís

544
00:31:08,269 --> 00:31:13,940
in up thanks robot like the I always

545
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:19,550
brand-new present you do another one

546
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:21,620
great man but it'll get better I want to

547
00:31:19,549 --> 00:31:23,450
pull it for him it's a new press for him

548
00:31:21,619 --> 00:31:26,179
you know what I mean I don't see the

549
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:28,190
flow much I mean it is flowing but we

550
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:29,840
can maximize are you yeah we can pull

551
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:35,960
the best quality so we're pulling

552
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:36,500
quality right we almost did three

553
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:40,360
minutes

554
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:51,410
oh that's annoying yeah buttons alarm

555
00:31:40,359 --> 00:31:54,619
yeah we'll never do that we're doing it

556
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:56,090
because that's the way this one is well

557
00:31:54,619 --> 00:31:57,679
normally when I press he goes off to the

558
00:31:56,089 --> 00:31:59,869
sides and I don't open it until it's

559
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:02,779
cooled off so this right now I would

560
00:31:59,869 --> 00:32:03,259
prefer to put it on something cold it's

561
00:32:02,779 --> 00:32:08,329
all we got

562
00:32:03,259 --> 00:32:10,460
yeah sorry apologize because I again

563
00:32:08,329 --> 00:32:14,990
Terk preservation is what we're going

564
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:17,630
for right the dump it's it's hot so it's

565
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:19,640
just reeking and it's just everything's

566
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:21,920
changing right now everything's changing

567
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:25,040
so I want to stop it that's that's

568
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:26,840
that's how I make mine he preserves that

569
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:29,029
heat and allows that heat to create

570
00:32:26,839 --> 00:32:32,389
vacuum which actually creates more heat

571
00:32:29,029 --> 00:32:34,129
because vacuum and heat changes when

572
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:35,660
you're under vacuum 90 degrees is

573
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:36,800
equivalent to like a hundred and

574
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:39,410
something I don't know you gotta look

575
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:41,779
Google it again so different techniques

576
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:43,940
for your different textures so just

577
00:32:41,779 --> 00:32:45,379
because he went in at 225 and he vacuums

578
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:48,140
it he's probably at a higher temperature

579
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:50,330
for momentarily when he's at 80 he's

580
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:52,940
potentially at a higher temp what the

581
00:32:50,329 --> 00:32:56,539
melting effect is not affecting it as

582
00:32:52,940 --> 00:33:02,990
much if he had direct 220 degrees versus

583
00:32:56,539 --> 00:33:06,500
vacuum that oh yeah but I don't like to

584
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:08,038
I prefer not cured yeah like tomorrow or

585
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:09,929
it tastes the same he's not

586
00:33:08,038 --> 00:33:11,970
smell the same right now yeah it's high

587
00:33:09,929 --> 00:33:14,070
so it so it's almost like when you open

588
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:16,858
a bottle of red wine you let it breathe

589
00:33:14,069 --> 00:33:22,200
yeah yeah yeah yeah that's like I said

590
00:33:16,858 --> 00:33:26,308
why did balls yeah yeah I do not I do I

591
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:29,038
make coins my material they he said the

592
00:33:26,308 --> 00:33:32,038
best step of all he ever smoked 13 years

593
00:33:29,038 --> 00:33:34,829
old nice and cured on the inside if that

594
00:33:32,038 --> 00:33:37,229
shell creates a protective layer and

595
00:33:34,829 --> 00:33:40,319
everything on the inside is just like

596
00:33:37,229 --> 00:33:42,778
it's locked and it eats itself up and a

597
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:45,538
jar tech type of style so that inner

598
00:33:42,778 --> 00:33:47,759
texture is urinated over that's done

599
00:33:45,538 --> 00:33:50,788
properly yeah I'm sure it can happen but

600
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:53,220
it's not it's like so unlikely yeah so

601
00:33:50,788 --> 00:33:56,158
hurt like for something to happen in

602
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:58,229
that 13 years it's very likely that

603
00:33:56,159 --> 00:34:00,059
something can go wrong or it can get

604
00:33:58,229 --> 00:34:02,340
smashed or it can get you know

605
00:34:00,058 --> 00:34:06,989
compromised by weather or hot

606
00:34:02,339 --> 00:34:11,250
temperatures whatever texture that's

607
00:34:06,989 --> 00:34:12,898
yeah that matters I personally believe

608
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:15,358
there's a shelf life on this Ash for

609
00:34:12,898 --> 00:34:17,429
sure like six months I think has a

610
00:34:15,358 --> 00:34:19,469
shorter shelf life

611
00:34:17,429 --> 00:34:22,639
yeah when you're heating it up when you

612
00:34:19,469 --> 00:34:25,168
use a jar tech because you've already

613
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:28,470
accelerated the decarboxylation process

614
00:34:25,168 --> 00:34:30,000
you have changed the thca the majority

615
00:34:28,469 --> 00:34:32,489
of this material right here in this hash

616
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,798
is THC a majority of the cannabinoids

617
00:34:32,489 --> 00:34:37,648
that are in this hash are acids that's

618
00:34:34,798 --> 00:34:39,599
how it's white as we start the

619
00:34:37,648 --> 00:34:42,239
decarboxylation process the natural

620
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:44,369
process of nature yes the plant is

621
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:46,769
already changing those heads as it's

622
00:34:44,369 --> 00:34:49,798
finishing just in the percent ratios or

623
00:34:46,769 --> 00:34:52,289
different so once you cut it that plant

624
00:34:49,798 --> 00:34:55,349
dies that's still continuing its it

625
00:34:52,289 --> 00:34:58,170
intensifies the decarboxylation effect

626
00:34:55,349 --> 00:35:00,059
as it's hanging in drying so during that

627
00:34:58,170 --> 00:35:01,769
process you still have a lot of acids

628
00:35:00,059 --> 00:35:04,829
and that's why it's important to process

629
00:35:01,769 --> 00:35:06,000
fresh material the older it gets you can

630
00:35:04,829 --> 00:35:07,829
freeze it you can put in the

631
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:11,159
refrigerator you're only going to delay

632
00:35:07,829 --> 00:35:14,130
the inevitable it naturally will do that

633
00:35:11,159 --> 00:35:16,289
so just if you get fresh material just

634
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:18,298
process it as fast as you can don't

635
00:35:16,289 --> 00:35:21,318
think that your freezers gonna save it

636
00:35:18,298 --> 00:35:22,998
for a year think it's going to change

637
00:35:21,318 --> 00:35:25,458
you know it's gonna I don't I don't

638
00:35:22,998 --> 00:35:27,048
believe it's gonna it's gonna get

639
00:35:25,458 --> 00:35:30,708
screwed up in your freezer the longer

640
00:35:27,048 --> 00:35:34,759
you keep it in there for sure like I I

641
00:35:30,708 --> 00:35:36,440
know running BHO II I've had runs where

642
00:35:34,759 --> 00:35:38,829
that it's been a year later and it still

643
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:40,699
came out good but I think for this

644
00:35:38,829 --> 00:35:42,499
letting it freeze for that long

645
00:35:40,699 --> 00:35:44,920
something's there's something's

646
00:35:42,498 --> 00:35:47,988
happening to the heads

647
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:50,690
me I'm like almost immediate I cut it

648
00:35:47,989 --> 00:35:52,999
down and it's like wash within a week of

649
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:55,849
the cut down the longest that's only if

650
00:35:52,998 --> 00:35:56,558
I have a whole bunch of stuff going on

651
00:35:55,849 --> 00:36:01,088
with it

652
00:35:56,559 --> 00:36:05,719
we are not in the ideal temperature I

653
00:36:01,088 --> 00:36:07,909
like to be under like I like 65 degrees

654
00:36:05,719 --> 00:36:09,769
for my pressing room it allows me to

655
00:36:07,909 --> 00:36:12,139
handle the material without it getting

656
00:36:09,768 --> 00:36:14,929
too cold or the material gets brittle

657
00:36:12,139 --> 00:36:17,629
and like shatter like and just shatters

658
00:36:14,929 --> 00:36:19,068
and if it's too warm you can't

659
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:20,838
manipulate it with the fingers because

660
00:36:19,068 --> 00:36:22,818
we our hands are 98 degrees so even

661
00:36:20,838 --> 00:36:26,838
though we're wearing gloves in a 65

662
00:36:22,818 --> 00:36:29,150
degree room if I touch this for just 510

663
00:36:26,838 --> 00:36:32,478
seconds you know seconds matter it

664
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:34,999
starts to stick so and gum and now you

665
00:36:32,478 --> 00:36:37,429
got hats on your fingers and wasted hash

666
00:36:34,998 --> 00:36:58,368
that doesn't get accounted for at the

667
00:36:37,429 --> 00:37:01,818
end of your processing know he's going

668
00:36:58,369 --> 00:37:05,358
to 210 yeah but I'm not gonna use that

669
00:37:01,818 --> 00:37:08,058
stupid loud noise so someone says can

670
00:37:05,358 --> 00:37:10,219
you guys talk about plate sizes versus

671
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:13,609
bag sizes one pressing bubble also

672
00:37:10,219 --> 00:37:15,889
freeze drying times freeze dryer that

673
00:37:13,608 --> 00:37:17,929
excuse me the new freeze dryers kind of

674
00:37:15,889 --> 00:37:19,788
do it all on itself that pharmaceutical

675
00:37:17,929 --> 00:37:22,338
one is literally set up for almost hash

676
00:37:19,789 --> 00:37:24,528
basically and it it senses it what does

677
00:37:22,338 --> 00:37:25,880
that set it though what do you mean like

678
00:37:24,528 --> 00:37:28,039
what is it automatically said that

679
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:30,380
what's the hours that it runs like it's

680
00:37:28,039 --> 00:37:32,269
mine is different every time it does a

681
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:34,039
batch run so it's actually testing all

682
00:37:32,268 --> 00:37:34,629
this different stuff and then once it's

683
00:37:34,039 --> 00:37:37,028
over

684
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:38,979
yeah the harvest right yeah I was dry

685
00:37:37,028 --> 00:37:41,318
yeah yeah the new pharmaceutical one it

686
00:37:38,978 --> 00:37:43,118
actually says like doing batch test run

687
00:37:41,318 --> 00:37:45,429
so it's doing all these different tests

688
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:48,640
that I think there's like 24 of them and

689
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:50,528
then it literally kicks on and gives it

690
00:37:48,639 --> 00:37:52,118
like an automatic time based on how much

691
00:37:50,528 --> 00:37:53,498
hash you have in the freezer because

692
00:37:52,119 --> 00:37:56,380
I've had it where it kicks on and it's

693
00:37:53,498 --> 00:37:58,328
like 36-hour dry time when I had a ton

694
00:37:56,380 --> 00:38:00,039
of hash in there and then I put less

695
00:37:58,329 --> 00:38:17,910
hash in there and it dries a little bit

696
00:38:00,039 --> 00:38:17,910
faster and then they also asked about

697
00:38:21,809 --> 00:38:27,009
plate sites plate sizes are very

698
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:29,139
important to me yeah very everything

699
00:38:27,009 --> 00:38:31,960
every time your plate sizes change you

700
00:38:29,139 --> 00:38:34,568
have to change your method and you have

701
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:36,940
to create your own method based on the

702
00:38:34,568 --> 00:38:38,798
plate size for example this plate size I

703
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:42,068
would not want to press a 20 grand puck

704
00:38:38,798 --> 00:38:43,809
on here it's just it's too small for 20

705
00:38:42,068 --> 00:38:45,219
grand puck so when I looked at it my

706
00:38:43,809 --> 00:38:46,809
first thought I was like 10 grand puck

707
00:38:45,219 --> 00:38:48,219
boom that's why I brought different

708
00:38:46,809 --> 00:38:48,969
pucks because I didn't know what this

709
00:38:48,219 --> 00:38:50,858
guy was going to look like

710
00:38:48,969 --> 00:39:01,710
I brought a foreground puck I got a 20

711
00:38:50,858 --> 00:39:06,818
gram puck and I got a timber that's what

712
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:10,119
hash makers are craftsmen little figure

713
00:39:06,818 --> 00:39:13,268
now we are craftsmen we then what we got

714
00:39:10,119 --> 00:39:17,140
tool belts we are guys to get our hands

715
00:39:13,268 --> 00:39:22,028
dirty we like to do things with our

716
00:39:17,139 --> 00:39:23,889
hands you know so hundred percent then a

717
00:39:22,028 --> 00:39:25,449
hundred percent even if I see it out

718
00:39:23,889 --> 00:39:26,949
there in the market I'm like I'm gonna

719
00:39:25,449 --> 00:39:28,838
pay you foreigner bucks for that

720
00:39:26,949 --> 00:39:30,278
twenty-five dollar piece of crap

721
00:39:28,838 --> 00:39:32,440
you know what I mean sorry but that's

722
00:39:30,278 --> 00:39:35,018
that's how I look at stuff sometimes

723
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:36,548
like if I know that I can recreate that

724
00:39:35,018 --> 00:39:37,538
and like why would I spend the money

725
00:39:36,548 --> 00:39:39,248
then there's some times are you just

726
00:39:37,539 --> 00:39:41,289
like you know what just buy it why

727
00:39:39,248 --> 00:39:43,538
because I can't really do that like the

728
00:39:41,289 --> 00:39:46,359
rosin I could not do it it's not as easy

729
00:39:43,539 --> 00:39:48,100
well hell no technologies presses badass

730
00:39:46,358 --> 00:39:49,960
and there's no way

731
00:39:48,099 --> 00:39:57,250
well I can duplicate that so you drop

732
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:59,260
the money on it is this size there's a

733
00:39:57,250 --> 00:40:00,940
two by three yeah go for it's a two by

734
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:05,230
three size it's the size of this bottom

735
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:09,280
right here so I I like small presses I

736
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:12,340
prefer I can see what's happening with

737
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:14,140
my rosin I don't like the ability not to

738
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:16,180
see what's happening on the sides I

739
00:40:14,139 --> 00:40:17,889
don't mean I would like see what we're

740
00:40:16,179 --> 00:40:19,929
doing here we're trying to like look at

741
00:40:17,889 --> 00:40:21,609
what's happening and if I'm only doing

742
00:40:19,929 --> 00:40:24,309
that though because I'm not used to this

743
00:40:21,610 --> 00:40:27,809
press I press I don't have to do it cuz

744
00:40:24,309 --> 00:40:27,809
I've done it so many times that like

745
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:33,670
mines huge mine's like 16 inches by like

746
00:40:32,199 --> 00:40:35,589
seven or eight

747
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:38,740
that's massive yeah that's that's a big

748
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:40,570
one my largest is as 14 inches long four

749
00:40:38,739 --> 00:40:42,849
inches why that's the largest one that I

750
00:40:40,570 --> 00:40:44,320
have that's the one I used started on

751
00:40:42,849 --> 00:40:45,670
pressing flour you might want to get

752
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:50,559
close in here it looks pretty big she's

753
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:53,190
gonna dump oh he should have a higher

754
00:40:50,559 --> 00:41:02,769
flow yeah look at that

755
00:40:53,190 --> 00:41:04,539
Wow the fangs for at home and like small

756
00:41:02,769 --> 00:41:06,670
little press this thing's pretty bitchin

757
00:41:04,539 --> 00:41:10,320
yeah but you're not gonna be able to do

758
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:10,320
a massive workload thank you so much man

759
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:16,360
yeah and this should be bolted to a

760
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:16,930
table and like the tables yeah very

761
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:19,120
sturdy

762
00:41:16,929 --> 00:41:27,969
yes sir like the least ideal conditions

763
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:32,230
possible you see the whole table

764
00:41:27,969 --> 00:41:35,399
completely full and half like this is

765
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:35,400
why stoners can't have nice things

766
00:41:35,909 --> 00:41:40,690
that's about good I went for I only went

767
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:42,340
for like two and a half minutes because

768
00:41:40,690 --> 00:41:46,320
it's such a smaller press like in an

769
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:46,320
amount that that's still really good

770
00:41:47,010 --> 00:41:50,010
sorry

771
00:41:51,130 --> 00:41:55,630
yeah I'm not happy how you doing there

772
00:41:53,048 --> 00:42:01,028
Tom you okay boy alright alright just

773
00:41:55,630 --> 00:42:02,108
making sure that's why I don't like

774
00:42:01,028 --> 00:42:05,708
these double bags

775
00:42:02,108 --> 00:42:07,088
eh killed my yield we'll see what

776
00:42:05,708 --> 00:42:12,909
happened well I know what this this

777
00:42:07,088 --> 00:42:15,308
material has but the size of your plates

778
00:42:12,909 --> 00:42:17,649
affect the amount of pressure that you

779
00:42:15,309 --> 00:42:19,719
apply the smaller the plate you need

780
00:42:17,650 --> 00:42:21,639
less pressure the larger the plate you

781
00:42:19,719 --> 00:42:23,679
need more pressure and quality plates

782
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:25,708
really make a difference too because the

783
00:42:23,679 --> 00:42:28,838
if you're not getting even pressure

784
00:42:25,708 --> 00:42:31,298
throughout the entire plate and the

785
00:42:28,838 --> 00:42:33,400
plate will shift or twist you're not

786
00:42:31,298 --> 00:42:34,659
gonna have a good quality press yeah

787
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:37,239
especially when you're trying to do a

788
00:42:34,659 --> 00:42:38,739
lot at once this like buttered up

789
00:42:37,239 --> 00:42:44,619
immediately and looks so good I want to

790
00:42:38,739 --> 00:42:46,929
smoke this she only got 40% on my yield

791
00:42:44,619 --> 00:42:51,039
which is not good this is this is a

792
00:42:46,929 --> 00:42:53,858
sixty five-plus squirter 60 68 should be

793
00:42:51,039 --> 00:42:55,900
60 so that tells me on my next press I

794
00:42:53,858 --> 00:42:58,719
gotta go a little bit longer possible or

795
00:42:55,900 --> 00:43:01,778
lower I'm like and it's kind of hard to

796
00:42:58,719 --> 00:43:03,309
get a full like yeah this is mind hard

797
00:43:01,778 --> 00:43:06,159
to really get your pressure into that

798
00:43:03,309 --> 00:43:11,019
thing here this is what you want to see

799
00:43:06,159 --> 00:43:12,808
I got it I got it either way it still

800
00:43:11,018 --> 00:43:15,958
gonna tip somebody just has to hold it

801
00:43:12,809 --> 00:43:15,959
tell me now

802
00:43:24,568 --> 00:43:29,349
here should be a little bit more tacky

803
00:43:26,679 --> 00:43:31,088
because of the key it has to get a

804
00:43:29,349 --> 00:43:33,630
little bit easier to handle but that's

805
00:43:31,088 --> 00:43:34,929
why temperatures are so important in my

806
00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:36,910
situation

807
00:43:34,929 --> 00:43:40,478
I'll give you an exact percentage of

808
00:43:36,909 --> 00:43:42,429
what I got back all laying this because

809
00:43:40,478 --> 00:43:44,439
I can just weigh the bags do the math

810
00:43:42,429 --> 00:43:46,748
and then do the math of the nine point

811
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:48,759
three that I put in that was a total

812
00:43:46,748 --> 00:43:50,379
yeah you weighed the whole thing with

813
00:43:48,759 --> 00:43:53,949
the bags in there and nine points and I

814
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:54,278
put these inside out yeah seems in right

815
00:43:53,949 --> 00:43:56,858
now

816
00:43:54,278 --> 00:43:58,088
no you seemed out yeah I'm the only one

817
00:43:56,858 --> 00:44:00,190
that does that everyone thinks I'm crazy

818
00:43:58,088 --> 00:44:01,779
but I'd never you look at how flat that

819
00:44:00,190 --> 00:44:03,730
is it looks perfect

820
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:07,000
let's let's see what I got back you have

821
00:44:03,730 --> 00:44:08,860
two of those 25s two of those small 25s

822
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:17,320
I can borrow real quick to get a hoe so

823
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:23,559
lean oh yeah tear it out yeah oh man

824
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:24,940
you're the best oh yeah twenty-five

825
00:44:23,559 --> 00:44:26,739
hours should be in the bag you need

826
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:28,630
those knees exactly

827
00:44:26,739 --> 00:44:50,289
yeah the exact same just I'll put two on

828
00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:54,010
there all right oh my bad boom tear and

829
00:44:50,289 --> 00:44:57,130
then we'll see how much this weighs so

830
00:44:54,010 --> 00:45:02,200
there was nine point three now there's

831
00:44:57,130 --> 00:45:03,550
two left so I got like 75 76 % I think

832
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:05,230
that's that's off the top of my head

833
00:45:03,550 --> 00:45:08,280
that's more in line with what it should

834
00:45:05,230 --> 00:45:11,110
be doing let's see and I noticed that

835
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:12,610
from past experiences the bigger the

836
00:45:11,110 --> 00:45:15,099
plates the heart of the attempts you

837
00:45:12,610 --> 00:45:18,220
have to go to achieve the higher

838
00:45:15,099 --> 00:45:21,250
percentages so what I attempted to do

839
00:45:18,219 --> 00:45:25,089
was recreate what I normally would do on

840
00:45:21,250 --> 00:45:28,750
my smaller press which is at 180 degrees

841
00:45:25,090 --> 00:45:31,720
and my press is maxed out at 3,000

842
00:45:28,750 --> 00:45:34,869
pounds and I only use 80% of that I

843
00:45:31,719 --> 00:45:36,369
don't even go there without 76 exactly

844
00:45:34,869 --> 00:45:38,619
yeah that's that's that's it

845
00:45:36,369 --> 00:45:40,539
that's where it should be that's now

846
00:45:38,619 --> 00:45:42,339
it's like all right let's do that and

847
00:45:40,539 --> 00:45:44,590
keep doing it that's you know that's

848
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:49,320
that's and this looks really freaking

849
00:45:44,590 --> 00:45:49,320
good I want to smoke this right now like

850
00:45:49,559 --> 00:45:57,299
dude good job buddy thanks man you -

851
00:45:53,199 --> 00:46:00,099
dude that's nice fucking nothing spit

852
00:45:57,300 --> 00:46:01,360
that was that two minutes like I pressed

853
00:46:00,099 --> 00:46:02,500
for like four but I'm also doing a

854
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:06,519
little bit bigger of a bag you know

855
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:09,230
whatever but man what a good getting a

856
00:46:06,519 --> 00:46:18,869
round of applause from every country and

857
00:46:09,230 --> 00:46:20,340
thanks Tom it's all you but yeah and

858
00:46:18,869 --> 00:46:24,179
like I always say I always tend to be

859
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:27,630
safe on my first I just have it in me

860
00:46:24,179 --> 00:46:29,399
not to over squish not to overheat so

861
00:46:27,630 --> 00:46:30,809
it's like you you don't torture freak

862
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:32,220
out I mean though that with that like

863
00:46:30,809 --> 00:46:34,650
because I turn it up so hot they're like

864
00:46:32,219 --> 00:46:36,299
it's gonna burn it it's gonna burn it is

865
00:46:34,650 --> 00:46:37,710
that Brown and I used to press my you

866
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:40,860
know like my big plates so that's where

867
00:46:37,710 --> 00:46:44,220
I was at I was over 200 220 you know to

868
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:47,099
get a good good squeeze out you need to

869
00:46:44,219 --> 00:46:48,869
to the bigger plates production it's

870
00:46:47,099 --> 00:46:50,639
almost about the same the amount you

871
00:46:48,869 --> 00:46:54,239
know because the squish time I'm only

872
00:46:50,639 --> 00:46:56,369
doing 50 seconds you know per 4 grams so

873
00:46:54,239 --> 00:46:58,589
if you do 4 4 4 it's at 12 grams 3

874
00:46:56,369 --> 00:47:00,929
minutes you do 10 grams or roughly 3

875
00:46:58,590 --> 00:47:03,539
minutes so it's almost about the same

876
00:47:00,929 --> 00:47:04,949
time we're losing using one bag it's all

877
00:47:03,539 --> 00:47:08,219
preference though you know people like

878
00:47:04,949 --> 00:47:10,500
Nikes or adidas right like what do you

879
00:47:08,219 --> 00:47:14,459
like but it what work do drew for the

880
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:17,840
fact that it looks like butter so crazy

881
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:21,000
that looks so good dude

882
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:22,200
good job nice you know YouTube there's

883
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,599
collaboration right there

884
00:47:22,199 --> 00:47:27,480
I've never had anybody press my material

885
00:47:24,599 --> 00:47:30,029
that's what's cool that I've washed have

886
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:32,760
I mean I can go to me and can't say I've

887
00:47:30,030 --> 00:47:35,580
yeah nobody's ever came in and rest your

888
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:37,380
stuff where I've pressed other people's

889
00:47:35,579 --> 00:47:39,299
stuff that they've washed and I'm not

890
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:41,970
always excited about that opportunity

891
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:43,320
you know I asked for my first time I

892
00:47:41,969 --> 00:47:45,000
actually got asked that they're like hey

893
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:45,990
I have a bunch that I have a freeze

894
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,760
dryer of everything but I don't have a

895
00:47:45,989 --> 00:47:49,589
press we pressed for me I was like you

896
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:51,060
put in all that time and effort you grow

897
00:47:49,590 --> 00:47:53,280
and you have the freeze dryer but you

898
00:47:51,059 --> 00:47:57,449
don't have a press I was like yeah no

899
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:59,370
problem you know some people trip out

900
00:47:57,449 --> 00:48:00,989
but the more you do it it's like it's

901
00:47:59,369 --> 00:48:02,489
like snowboarding you going down the

902
00:48:00,989 --> 00:48:03,989
biggest hill on the first try yeah it

903
00:48:02,489 --> 00:48:07,619
sucks but once you've done it 30 times

904
00:48:03,989 --> 00:48:09,209
it's like cool let's go yeah it is your

905
00:48:07,619 --> 00:48:11,099
experience level you know you either

906
00:48:09,210 --> 00:48:11,610
doing the diamonds or you're doing the

907
00:48:11,099 --> 00:48:16,469
blues

908
00:48:11,610 --> 00:48:18,780
Green was a great return and this is

909
00:48:16,469 --> 00:48:19,889
only that's only that part that was all

910
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:29,280
right there's a whole another part over

911
00:48:19,889 --> 00:48:30,599
there and that's what you do you play

912
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:34,380
with temperatures you play with

913
00:48:30,599 --> 00:48:36,089
different things and it'll do different

914
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:37,950
and it'll look different you're gonna

915
00:48:36,090 --> 00:48:40,140
see his is different from this texture

916
00:48:37,949 --> 00:48:44,069
yeah mine's a little more buttery but

917
00:48:40,139 --> 00:48:53,029
that's just cuz it went hotter but this

918
00:48:44,070 --> 00:48:55,470
stuff looks insane good came out amazing

919
00:48:53,030 --> 00:49:05,130
I'm so surprised like it looks like

920
00:48:55,469 --> 00:49:09,230
butter but you can just grab it and it's

921
00:49:05,130 --> 00:49:09,230
nice and cold in here too yeah so

922
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:15,449
definitely got a dab on it you

923
00:49:14,099 --> 00:49:23,130
definitely got a DAB on your finger that

924
00:49:15,449 --> 00:49:26,339
all smoke speaking of dabs to smoke I'm

925
00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:28,230
about to try that man I'm not a fresh

926
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:36,150
pressed person but that looks really

927
00:49:28,230 --> 00:49:40,289
good is that okay George yes please

928
00:49:36,150 --> 00:49:42,930
well III do my cure I do my cure usually

929
00:49:40,289 --> 00:49:45,719
and like he said I believe you get less

930
00:49:42,929 --> 00:49:50,759
taste on the fresh press especially like

931
00:49:45,719 --> 00:49:53,789
directly after pressing but we all do it

932
00:49:50,760 --> 00:50:01,860
we all do it y'all curious you know

933
00:49:53,789 --> 00:50:03,809
you're wondering okay I've had some

934
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:05,670
stuff that was like it was like oranges

935
00:50:03,809 --> 00:50:07,230
it smelled like oranges it was amazing

936
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:08,789
and I still have the jar and it's about

937
00:50:07,230 --> 00:50:13,110
two months old and now it smells like

938
00:50:08,789 --> 00:50:14,880
salsa like insane hot spicy Tapatio

939
00:50:13,110 --> 00:50:16,950
salts or something you're like what

940
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:18,599
happened and it's still when you smoke

941
00:50:16,949 --> 00:50:21,569
it is it delicious

942
00:50:18,599 --> 00:50:23,730
still has that orange taste yeah well no

943
00:50:21,570 --> 00:50:25,470
it took it took that two months like

944
00:50:23,730 --> 00:50:26,639
every time I open it smell like

945
00:50:25,469 --> 00:50:28,230
gorgeous oranges just immediately

946
00:50:26,639 --> 00:50:29,460
oranges and then one day like I probably

947
00:50:28,230 --> 00:50:31,079
didn't open it for two weeks or

948
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:32,429
something and I opened it and it

949
00:50:31,079 --> 00:50:34,889
literally smelled like salsa and I'm

950
00:50:32,429 --> 00:50:36,509
like how did that happen and it's still

951
00:50:34,889 --> 00:50:38,279
amazing I wish I had brought it with me

952
00:50:36,510 --> 00:50:44,040
so you guys could smell it I feel like

953
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:45,420
all this stuff it's a lot of acids so

954
00:50:44,039 --> 00:50:47,279
you're good there's there's there's

955
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:49,200
partial D carbonyl air it's gonna make

956
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:57,390
me eat much more sticky than its gonna

957
00:50:49,199 --> 00:50:59,879
get you high yeah yeah little turkey huh

958
00:50:57,389 --> 00:51:01,348
get some of those jelly beans in you too

959
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:11,930
that would be a perfect little mix you

960
00:51:01,349 --> 00:51:14,309
know so there is a difference in what

961
00:51:11,929 --> 00:51:16,049
the textures tip you flatten that out

962
00:51:14,309 --> 00:51:18,900
and might look at this more like very

963
00:51:16,050 --> 00:51:21,599
close like yeah similar texture wise it

964
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:23,010
not sure I haven't touched it is

965
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:27,480
actually pretty damn stable I was

966
00:51:23,010 --> 00:51:29,849
surprised pardon me

967
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:33,210
they're both exactly the same this was

968
00:51:29,849 --> 00:51:37,250
addressed at 180 yeah yeah both yeah

969
00:51:33,210 --> 00:51:37,250
they're exactly the same pressed at 180

970
00:51:38,838 --> 00:51:46,679
yeah and what Bragg's did you use a 25

971
00:51:42,838 --> 00:51:49,588
to 25 and a 37 okay and you use 25 to 25

972
00:51:46,679 --> 00:51:51,779
yeah use 225 correct I did 25 and a 37

973
00:51:49,588 --> 00:51:54,059
and we're used and you're still worried

974
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:57,869
about you think that you're gonna lose

975
00:51:54,059 --> 00:51:59,940
at at the lower centage at the it's all

976
00:51:57,869 --> 00:52:01,858
about like again like re if we're gonna

977
00:51:59,940 --> 00:52:03,358
talk you know higher temps then you can

978
00:52:01,858 --> 00:52:04,679
actually push that out through your bags

979
00:52:03,358 --> 00:52:06,619
a lot right there because you got hotter

980
00:52:04,679 --> 00:52:09,029
temps it's gonna get higher flow rate

981
00:52:06,619 --> 00:52:11,670
lower a low rate yes

982
00:52:09,030 --> 00:52:14,099
so lower temps you have a slower flow

983
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:17,010
rate you have more hold back time I owe

984
00:52:14,099 --> 00:52:18,570
this that that when you fold your bags

985
00:52:17,010 --> 00:52:20,400
to and way you placing them in your

986
00:52:18,570 --> 00:52:22,650
parchment you can create channels and

987
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:24,750
flow and create it to just squeeze out

988
00:52:22,650 --> 00:52:26,970
questions to really pack them in there

989
00:52:24,750 --> 00:52:29,039
too much on it each other they'll tend

990
00:52:26,969 --> 00:52:32,338
to blow out I actually give myself space

991
00:52:29,039 --> 00:52:33,989
in between each bag a little bit and I

992
00:52:32,338 --> 00:52:36,989
and I notice it actually creates those

993
00:52:33,989 --> 00:52:37,549
channels for the the hash to through and

994
00:52:36,989 --> 00:52:39,259
it help

995
00:52:37,550 --> 00:52:44,600
a little bit yeah I'm gonna try it or

996
00:52:39,260 --> 00:52:46,190
what I believe it's just kind of hard to

997
00:52:44,599 --> 00:52:49,039
press that thing in the first place and

998
00:52:46,190 --> 00:52:51,380
then I think what you're doing - yeah

999
00:52:49,039 --> 00:52:53,449
you can't like on one of these you use

1000
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:55,099
your fingers that's all you got you know

1001
00:52:53,449 --> 00:52:58,699
and then when you're going down and then

1002
00:52:55,099 --> 00:53:04,610
it jerks on things goes off your game

1003
00:52:58,699 --> 00:53:06,259
for a minute but again it's like it's

1004
00:53:04,610 --> 00:53:09,010
like it's like double dare when you're

1005
00:53:06,260 --> 00:53:11,240
you know or something where so you know

1006
00:53:09,010 --> 00:53:17,750
the difference of the tools that's what

1007
00:53:11,239 --> 00:53:19,599
it comes down to our temperatures is

1008
00:53:17,750 --> 00:53:22,460
pretty much what he came down

1009
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:25,250
temperatures you know and and it creates

1010
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:28,880
a different consistency you know I like

1011
00:53:25,250 --> 00:53:31,280
to create a single consistent product so

1012
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:33,289
that's what I'm trying to eliminate the

1013
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:36,410
THC a kickin up because that's what

1014
00:53:33,289 --> 00:53:38,059
tends to occur at a lower temp at a

1015
00:53:36,409 --> 00:53:39,469
higher temperature you tend to melt it a

1016
00:53:38,059 --> 00:53:40,909
little better so it tends to come out a

1017
00:53:39,469 --> 00:53:45,079
little creamier comes out a little bit

1018
00:53:40,909 --> 00:53:46,670
shinier it all comes down to personal

1019
00:53:45,079 --> 00:53:48,559
preference and what your in customer

1020
00:53:46,670 --> 00:53:50,210
wants to a lot of time that's what it

1021
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:51,619
really comes down to and it's like yeah

1022
00:53:50,210 --> 00:53:52,909
somebody wants something to jar tech

1023
00:53:51,619 --> 00:53:54,589
then you got to change your game you got

1024
00:53:52,909 --> 00:53:58,819
to go up in temps like I know I've lost

1025
00:53:54,590 --> 00:54:00,650
customers that have bothered me for for

1026
00:53:58,820 --> 00:54:03,110
a full melt and I just don't make full

1027
00:54:00,650 --> 00:54:05,450
melt I don't take the time to pull those

1028
00:54:03,110 --> 00:54:07,490
mini bags and separate everything out

1029
00:54:05,449 --> 00:54:09,079
and then go you know have to call

1030
00:54:07,489 --> 00:54:11,569
everything oh it's not really full spec

1031
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:13,849
because I pulled this the the 70 to 90

1032
00:54:11,570 --> 00:54:15,289
out on the first wash I just don't even

1033
00:54:13,849 --> 00:54:18,019
have time for that I'm giving you like

1034
00:54:15,289 --> 00:54:20,750
everything here you go I don't even

1035
00:54:18,019 --> 00:54:24,250
smoke full note myself if you want pull

1036
00:54:20,750 --> 00:54:27,500
metal head up camera guy's got the bomb

1037
00:54:24,250 --> 00:54:27,500
[Laughter]

1038
00:54:30,108 --> 00:54:41,028
I am I am more than like three or four

1039
00:54:35,630 --> 00:54:43,039
days cured whipped up cold care yeah but

1040
00:54:41,028 --> 00:54:46,489
I like I said I it looks so good I want

1041
00:54:43,039 --> 00:54:50,690
to try it there's it's not gonna hurt to

1042
00:54:46,489 --> 00:54:52,159
to give it a go but but we do know that

1043
00:54:50,690 --> 00:54:53,480
it's gonna definitely have less of it

1044
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:58,759
taste yeah it's not gonna look like this

1045
00:54:53,480 --> 00:55:01,369
tomorrow depending on the conditions

1046
00:54:58,759 --> 00:55:04,608
that it's kept in yeah no it'll get

1047
00:55:01,369 --> 00:55:08,630
whiter this is the the end result yeah

1048
00:55:04,608 --> 00:55:10,518
it wider it's gonna get wider it would

1049
00:55:08,630 --> 00:55:15,170
go in the refrigerator Janna fridge in a

1050
00:55:10,518 --> 00:55:21,199
colder air conference yeah yeah that one

1051
00:55:15,170 --> 00:55:27,680
will for sure yeah it's gonna end up

1052
00:55:21,199 --> 00:55:32,808
looking like this fuck it so that see

1053
00:55:27,679 --> 00:55:37,909
the the how the color changes this one

1054
00:55:32,809 --> 00:55:40,489
yeah maybe three days now no no no this

1055
00:55:37,909 --> 00:55:48,199
has not been down what I carry in my bag

1056
00:55:40,489 --> 00:55:50,599
okay no not the reason I don't carry a

1057
00:55:48,199 --> 00:55:52,219
mini cooler or keep my Terps cool in my

1058
00:55:50,599 --> 00:55:54,289
bag is that I want to see the

1059
00:55:52,219 --> 00:55:55,788
degradation of what's gonna happen to my

1060
00:55:54,289 --> 00:55:57,980
product when someone doesn't take care

1061
00:55:55,789 --> 00:55:59,930
of it I know someone's gonna leave it in

1062
00:55:57,980 --> 00:56:02,269
the car I know someone's gonna put it in

1063
00:55:59,929 --> 00:56:03,588
their pocket so it's fun to see when you

1064
00:56:02,268 --> 00:56:06,018
have like such a good product that it

1065
00:56:03,588 --> 00:56:08,058
still stays badass no matter how much

1066
00:56:06,018 --> 00:56:13,308
you beat it up but it left in my car out

1067
00:56:08,059 --> 00:56:16,130
to the air open being open is not good

1068
00:56:13,309 --> 00:56:18,769
we're about every time you smell it and

1069
00:56:16,130 --> 00:56:20,630
you just evaporated Terps from here we

1070
00:56:18,768 --> 00:56:22,848
lost Turkey because they keep open-close

1071
00:56:20,630 --> 00:56:25,880
open-close in it now the reason I like

1072
00:56:22,849 --> 00:56:28,190
this texture is temple ball okay we're

1073
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:31,519
talking Temple Bar really it creates a

1074
00:56:28,190 --> 00:56:33,200
seal and right that was trim trim run

1075
00:56:31,518 --> 00:56:34,998
that's not the bus trim run dude it

1076
00:56:33,199 --> 00:56:38,169
tastes it tastes great funny dude tastes

1077
00:56:34,998 --> 00:56:38,169
great for trim run dude

1078
00:56:38,789 --> 00:56:43,930
good taste were really good for trim run

1079
00:56:41,199 --> 00:56:46,119
dude but like again I'm a big believer

1080
00:56:43,929 --> 00:56:48,518
in its it's all in the wash it couldn't

1081
00:56:46,119 --> 00:56:50,349
love zone that's not true it comes from

1082
00:56:48,518 --> 00:56:52,808
the genetics comes from the farmer comes

1083
00:56:50,349 --> 00:56:54,818
from the practices comes there's there's

1084
00:56:52,809 --> 00:56:58,089
a difference of harvesting flour which

1085
00:56:54,818 --> 00:57:00,219
everybody does and harvesting trikes and

1086
00:56:58,088 --> 00:57:02,498
flowers so there's a whole different

1087
00:57:00,219 --> 00:57:05,019
mindset of harvesting trikes you know

1088
00:57:02,498 --> 00:57:07,328
I'm a trike harvester and I love

1089
00:57:05,018 --> 00:57:09,518
harvesting flour and guess what trikes

1090
00:57:07,329 --> 00:57:11,380
are hauling off every moment just like

1091
00:57:09,518 --> 00:57:13,808
Frenchie cannoli was talking about the

1092
00:57:11,380 --> 00:57:16,358
analogy he uses is the trikes are like a

1093
00:57:13,809 --> 00:57:18,009
ripe apples on a tree and all you got to

1094
00:57:16,358 --> 00:57:19,900
do is this shake it and the right

1095
00:57:18,009 --> 00:57:22,358
baffles fall that's what's happening

1096
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:23,889
when you're doing a takedown so the way

1097
00:57:22,358 --> 00:57:25,688
that people sometimes there it is like

1098
00:57:23,889 --> 00:57:27,458
ripping things down here it's our Fox

1099
00:57:25,688 --> 00:57:29,949
feeling when you see him clip and then

1100
00:57:27,458 --> 00:57:31,958
they're just not you're like no no no be

1101
00:57:29,949 --> 00:57:38,108
very careful with what you're doing have

1102
00:57:31,958 --> 00:57:40,179
your bag open you know turn your trash

1103
00:57:38,108 --> 00:57:42,458
to cash over here no no now we're

1104
00:57:40,179 --> 00:57:44,198
turning we're turning extremely high

1105
00:57:42,458 --> 00:57:46,118
quality marijuana and it's a dream at

1106
00:57:44,199 --> 00:57:48,278
high quality it just has maintained its

1107
00:57:46,119 --> 00:57:50,499
shine we're taking high quality in this

1108
00:57:48,278 --> 00:57:52,958
bit shine in it because when you see the

1109
00:57:50,498 --> 00:57:54,788
flower next to it you're just like damn

1110
00:57:52,958 --> 00:57:56,798
that's like a fucking Lamborghini parked

1111
00:57:54,789 --> 00:57:59,229
next to a Ferrari now because it's like

1112
00:57:56,798 --> 00:58:02,288
they they they they complement each

1113
00:57:59,228 --> 00:58:05,919
other it shows off the clean the

1114
00:58:02,289 --> 00:58:09,219
cleanliness the the actual practices of

1115
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:13,179
that farmer and then it's the

1116
00:58:09,219 --> 00:58:15,579
craftsmanship of the hash maker that

1117
00:58:13,179 --> 00:58:18,459
helps guide the farmer and love

1118
00:58:15,579 --> 00:58:20,469
trichomes so it's like the farmer

1119
00:58:18,458 --> 00:58:21,938
already has a love for the flower so now

1120
00:58:20,469 --> 00:58:24,489
you just have to tell him now you have

1121
00:58:21,938 --> 00:58:26,618
to start loving the trichomes now so

1122
00:58:24,489 --> 00:58:30,309
there's a whole different process of

1123
00:58:26,619 --> 00:58:33,119
teaching and going through to produce

1124
00:58:30,309 --> 00:58:36,969
quality product out of trim

1125
00:58:33,119 --> 00:58:39,338
not everybody's trim can do this no I

1126
00:58:36,969 --> 00:58:41,499
guarantee definitely not I've ran trim

1127
00:58:39,338 --> 00:58:44,650
that comes out just like his the Mac

1128
00:58:41,498 --> 00:58:46,808
usually pumps a very white crystal and

1129
00:58:44,650 --> 00:58:48,309
it's very good even in trim and I've ran

1130
00:58:46,809 --> 00:58:49,630
other trim where it's so brown you're

1131
00:58:48,309 --> 00:58:50,690
just like dude I don't even will I give

1132
00:58:49,630 --> 00:58:52,430
it to somebody for edibles

1133
00:58:50,690 --> 00:58:54,349
I feel bad even though I know it's

1134
00:58:52,429 --> 00:58:57,199
really high-quality hash rosin is

1135
00:58:54,349 --> 00:59:00,230
extremely clean it's been sifted it's

1136
00:58:57,199 --> 00:59:03,949
been you know processed but it's just so

1137
00:59:00,230 --> 00:59:05,030
dark it's very unappealing yeah and

1138
00:59:03,949 --> 00:59:07,549
that's what it comes down to

1139
00:59:05,030 --> 00:59:10,640
aesthetically exactly that's like it is

1140
00:59:07,550 --> 00:59:12,829
focused on everybody is they want the

1141
00:59:10,639 --> 00:59:14,000
white rosin though they want the creamy

1142
00:59:12,829 --> 00:59:15,050
right didn't you give me a white rosin

1143
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,429
they want the creamy rod then you give

1144
00:59:15,050 --> 00:59:19,400
me cream they want the jam and the

1145
00:59:16,429 --> 00:59:21,710
orange kids in a candy store it's like

1146
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:24,349
no it's like you want to just tell them

1147
00:59:21,710 --> 00:59:26,449
what you get but it's like at the same

1148
00:59:24,349 --> 00:59:27,680
time it's like you know what it's a

1149
00:59:26,449 --> 00:59:30,230
different it's different it's a

1150
00:59:27,679 --> 00:59:33,710
challenge never-ending you know love

1151
00:59:30,230 --> 00:59:37,670
story so I I like that challenge do I

1152
00:59:33,710 --> 00:59:39,139
agree with it no do I do it yes you know

1153
00:59:37,670 --> 00:59:40,608
and that's life there's certain things

1154
00:59:39,139 --> 00:59:42,949
that we have to do that we just don't

1155
00:59:40,608 --> 00:59:44,719
like and we have to do it we want to be

1156
00:59:42,949 --> 00:59:47,179
an adult you have to pay your bills do

1157
00:59:44,719 --> 00:59:48,500
we like it not really but we do it and

1158
00:59:47,179 --> 00:59:50,809
you know what I mean so it's like that's

1159
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:53,300
the same mentality you have to have when

1160
00:59:50,809 --> 00:59:55,400
you get criticism I I don't like

1161
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:59,119
criticism it hurts my feelings I'll be

1162
00:59:55,400 --> 01:00:01,369
honest but without it I can't learn you

1163
00:59:59,119 --> 01:00:02,780
know I mean it hurts my feelings when

1164
01:00:01,369 --> 01:00:04,880
someone says dude this is not what I

1165
01:00:02,780 --> 01:00:07,280
want you know it only hurts my feelings

1166
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:08,990
because I put so much yeah we're really

1167
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:19,600
trying hard especially when you're like

1168
01:00:08,989 --> 01:00:22,669
trying to be honest about it's not

1169
01:00:19,599 --> 01:00:22,670
[Music]

1170
01:00:22,838 --> 01:00:27,828
that's my point

1171
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:30,440
it's not but the truth of the reality is

1172
01:00:27,829 --> 01:00:32,119
it does you know what I mean we all have

1173
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:35,059
a heart and we all get our feelings hurt

1174
01:00:32,119 --> 01:00:37,099
but do we expose that no but it's the

1175
01:00:35,059 --> 01:00:38,960
truth man if you love what you do and

1176
01:00:37,099 --> 01:00:40,880
somebody says this is not what I was

1177
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:44,119
looking for if you really love what you

1178
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:45,769
do it's gonna feel like you accomplished

1179
01:00:44,119 --> 01:00:48,068
the task that you were asked to do

1180
01:00:45,769 --> 01:00:50,838
absolutely and it's disappointing to

1181
01:00:48,068 --> 01:00:52,940
walk away from that and and all I want

1182
01:00:50,838 --> 01:00:55,369
to do after that is make up for it like

1183
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:57,619
I need to make up for it I failed and

1184
01:00:55,369 --> 01:00:59,690
and there is no failure it only if you

1185
01:00:57,619 --> 01:01:01,750
quit so it's like I'm not done like well

1186
01:00:59,690 --> 01:01:03,740
you know the shot you know kind of thing

1187
01:01:01,750 --> 01:01:04,880
but sometimes it doesn't

1188
01:01:03,739 --> 01:01:07,279
that way sometimes they're just

1189
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:08,840
disappointed and that's it you know like

1190
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:11,150
I said I've lost customers just because

1191
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:11,539
I'm not making full milt yeah come on

1192
01:01:11,150 --> 01:01:13,250
yeah

1193
01:01:11,539 --> 01:01:15,889
like trust me actually smoke my ass I

1194
01:01:13,250 --> 01:01:17,539
told me in my opinion I can produce a

1195
01:01:15,889 --> 01:01:19,579
beautiful product but that's not the

1196
01:01:17,539 --> 01:01:22,759
texture and the consistency that they

1197
01:01:19,579 --> 01:01:24,799
want so therefore you know it didn't it

1198
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:28,160
didn't work out for whatever reason you

1199
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:30,320
know so there's a lot of there's a lot

1200
01:01:28,159 --> 01:01:32,809
of other stuff that goes on in a hash

1201
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:34,369
makers life that we don't really expose

1202
01:01:32,809 --> 01:01:35,960
or talk about it like this

1203
01:01:34,369 --> 01:01:37,730
don't don't even get into like personal

1204
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:40,369
issues that everybody has to go through

1205
01:01:37,730 --> 01:01:41,690
every single person you know everybody's

1206
01:01:40,369 --> 01:01:43,670
fighting some battle you know nothing

1207
01:01:41,690 --> 01:01:45,769
about people have loved ones they lose

1208
01:01:43,670 --> 01:01:49,490
things all sorts of crazy shit out them

1209
01:01:45,769 --> 01:01:51,079
so it's like you never it sucks like you

1210
01:01:49,489 --> 01:01:52,609
said when someone talks about about you

1211
01:01:51,079 --> 01:01:54,829
but it's really nice to get all the

1212
01:01:52,610 --> 01:01:57,519
positive feedback it makes up for one

1213
01:01:54,829 --> 01:02:00,679
compliment makes all the time yeah yeah

1214
01:01:57,519 --> 01:02:03,380
shit you just like fuck yeah you know

1215
01:02:00,679 --> 01:02:06,949
they believe in me and that's what

1216
01:02:03,380 --> 01:02:09,200
drives me is anybody that believes in me

1217
01:02:06,949 --> 01:02:10,819
like if they're like dude yeah the

1218
01:02:09,199 --> 01:02:13,009
people that show me love that don't even

1219
01:02:10,820 --> 01:02:15,039
know me it's just it blows me away I'm

1220
01:02:13,010 --> 01:02:19,130
like there's no reason you guys should

1221
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:21,380
like like I'm just out there doing what

1222
01:02:19,130 --> 01:02:27,108
I love to I were used to work at a bank

1223
01:02:21,380 --> 01:02:29,150
for a long time I say I did the office

1224
01:02:27,108 --> 01:02:30,949
space life and it's just not for me I

1225
01:02:29,150 --> 01:02:33,349
like I like to create a product that

1226
01:02:30,949 --> 01:02:35,839
like I can make people happy with and

1227
01:02:33,349 --> 01:02:42,909
it's super it's so rewarding so like you

1228
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:44,350
say it's like the amount from the hash

1229
01:02:42,909 --> 01:02:47,500
[Applause]

1230
01:02:44,349 --> 01:02:50,980
so funny that's that the

1231
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:54,670
anti-inflammatory and the pain wanna try

1232
01:02:50,980 --> 01:02:54,670
yeah we'll try yours

1233
01:02:57,329 --> 01:03:02,849
now his is easier to work with off the

1234
01:03:00,150 --> 01:03:06,480
bat this is the consistency texture

1235
01:03:02,849 --> 01:03:10,319
other than the the caking I call this

1236
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:13,050
kicking in my opinion it's very taking

1237
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:16,080
it depending on what you're trying to do

1238
01:03:13,050 --> 01:03:17,760
he goes into a jar so that isn't and

1239
01:03:16,079 --> 01:03:19,289
that's not I'm robbing the hell out of

1240
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:24,390
it that's all that's probably out of him

1241
01:03:19,289 --> 01:03:27,000
I am making a nice solid temple ball

1242
01:03:24,389 --> 01:03:29,039
that's flat this stuff is so melty it

1243
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:31,139
can't stay in a temple ball

1244
01:03:29,039 --> 01:03:34,889
however it's gonna seep down theory

1245
01:03:31,139 --> 01:03:36,809
behind this is based on the temple ball

1246
01:03:34,889 --> 01:03:39,150
theory I am a true traditional hash

1247
01:03:36,809 --> 01:03:41,429
shishun from the beginning of temple

1248
01:03:39,150 --> 01:03:43,590
balls in the traditional dark hashes so

1249
01:03:41,429 --> 01:03:45,899
I still a lot of my methods freeze dryer

1250
01:03:43,590 --> 01:03:48,059
I run my freeze dry for eight hours I'm

1251
01:03:45,900 --> 01:03:49,980
done I'll put six pounds of fucking dry

1252
01:03:48,059 --> 01:03:53,070
ash in there and it'll be done in eight

1253
01:03:49,980 --> 01:03:55,710
hours why because I don't always do

1254
01:03:53,070 --> 01:03:56,970
things the same way you know I can

1255
01:03:55,710 --> 01:03:58,199
definitely cut it short I've cut them

1256
01:03:56,969 --> 01:04:00,329
short sometimes and they're like

1257
01:03:58,199 --> 01:04:02,579
everything's dry I'm like how did it dry

1258
01:04:00,329 --> 01:04:04,170
that click and it rocks it sometimes but

1259
01:04:02,579 --> 01:04:06,989
I've also ran other stuff where I

1260
01:04:04,170 --> 01:04:09,570
noticed usually the the crappie or the

1261
01:04:06,989 --> 01:04:11,729
heads are the ones that don't dry like

1262
01:04:09,570 --> 01:04:14,400
like if you saw like I'll save my food

1263
01:04:11,730 --> 01:04:17,789
grade you know what I mean my 182 to 219

1264
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:19,139
and that stuff won't freeze but I can

1265
01:04:17,789 --> 01:04:21,509
put that in the material because that's

1266
01:04:19,139 --> 01:04:24,539
all that material do and it's blowing

1267
01:04:21,510 --> 01:04:26,520
around it's blows around it's not in my

1268
01:04:24,539 --> 01:04:28,079
it's it's on a separate tray by itself

1269
01:04:26,519 --> 01:04:29,730
but it's still in the freeze dryer with

1270
01:04:28,079 --> 01:04:31,409
everything else and I pull all the other

1271
01:04:29,730 --> 01:04:33,630
trays and everything's fine and dry as a

1272
01:04:31,409 --> 01:04:35,069
bone and then I pull those and crappier

1273
01:04:33,630 --> 01:04:36,900
and rot and there's like yeah little

1274
01:04:35,070 --> 01:04:41,370
icebergs of rocks and cuz they're not

1275
01:04:36,900 --> 01:04:43,619
heads ya know it's all stock it's all

1276
01:04:41,369 --> 01:04:45,719
stocks it's totally awesome it's just

1277
01:04:43,619 --> 01:04:47,489
funny figuring that out along the way

1278
01:04:45,719 --> 01:04:49,409
then there's no damn book written no

1279
01:04:47,489 --> 01:04:52,169
one's telling you nothing I looked at

1280
01:04:49,409 --> 01:04:55,139
the harvester I called him up they told

1281
01:04:52,170 --> 01:04:56,099
me run it for fucking 36 hours they told

1282
01:04:55,139 --> 01:04:59,579
me that though you know the whole

1283
01:04:56,099 --> 01:05:02,279
process like 36 hours so we did it you

1284
01:04:59,579 --> 01:05:03,449
know and and then it's lying dude with

1285
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:04,650
all that you know I did the scooping

1286
01:05:03,449 --> 01:05:06,480
technique because that's what I saw

1287
01:05:04,650 --> 01:05:08,639
online you know I mean the Instagram

1288
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:08,940
people were scooping mom was scoop all

1289
01:05:08,639 --> 01:05:12,480
right

1290
01:05:08,940 --> 01:05:15,150
school and throw it in there and we do

1291
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:17,730
36 hours and you know it's done right

1292
01:05:15,150 --> 01:05:20,099
and damn that's a long time yeah and

1293
01:05:17,730 --> 01:05:23,400
then it's full of all this ice okay

1294
01:05:20,099 --> 01:05:25,800
right let's like take a chunk it up Tim

1295
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:27,420
this is turqu water fell yeah there's a

1296
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:30,240
fucking Turk trap over here this thing's

1297
01:05:27,420 --> 01:05:31,950
sucking Turks out oh by the minute this

1298
01:05:30,239 --> 01:05:34,169
is good ice you know it's Turk water

1299
01:05:31,949 --> 01:05:39,299
yeah yeah we sell this shit like we were

1300
01:05:34,170 --> 01:05:41,039
all that water that is oh so gnarly

1301
01:05:39,300 --> 01:05:43,470
I'm like why in the hell do I want to

1302
01:05:41,039 --> 01:05:45,960
put my product in a Terp trap when all

1303
01:05:43,469 --> 01:05:48,868
I'm trying to do is preserve Terps so I

1304
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:51,960
I played with different methods to

1305
01:05:48,869 --> 01:05:54,599
minimize the time that it's exposed in

1306
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:57,269
that machine and again I'm not a scooper

1307
01:05:54,599 --> 01:05:59,220
because I'm not making water I'm making

1308
01:05:57,269 --> 01:06:02,699
hash so I'm trying to just fill my fries

1309
01:05:59,219 --> 01:06:05,309
dryer with hash because 50% even my

1310
01:06:02,699 --> 01:06:08,399
amount that I put in there squeezed out

1311
01:06:05,309 --> 01:06:10,019
has 55 percent or 50 percent my numbers

1312
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:12,450
will usually come in there that's how I

1313
01:06:10,019 --> 01:06:15,059
know how I did on my wash that's

1314
01:06:12,449 --> 01:06:17,399
important to me I need to know did I do

1315
01:06:15,059 --> 01:06:19,019
my job did I did I get distracted and

1316
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:20,940
change the music too long and it's new

1317
01:06:19,019 --> 01:06:23,338
did I do my dance to my stupid little

1318
01:06:20,940 --> 01:06:25,588
things affect what you do in there so I

1319
01:06:23,338 --> 01:06:26,818
like to check my work and and that's the

1320
01:06:25,588 --> 01:06:28,710
squeezing out old-school traditional

1321
01:06:26,818 --> 01:06:31,679
method you chop it all up and I know

1322
01:06:28,710 --> 01:06:34,230
there's a particular layer that I cannot

1323
01:06:31,679 --> 01:06:35,338
go over cuz if I don't do my chopping up

1324
01:06:34,230 --> 01:06:37,530
and people like dude are you done yet

1325
01:06:35,338 --> 01:06:38,849
they say no because it ain't right so we

1326
01:06:37,530 --> 01:06:41,339
got to finish it and then you chop it

1327
01:06:38,849 --> 01:06:44,099
all up nice and even I know I can get

1328
01:06:41,338 --> 01:06:46,259
just over a pound on every tray of

1329
01:06:44,099 --> 01:06:48,420
quality dried hash it only has

1330
01:06:46,260 --> 01:06:50,369
approximately 50% so I'm like I'm okay

1331
01:06:48,420 --> 01:06:52,920
with that you know what I mean but I

1332
01:06:50,369 --> 01:06:54,869
don't like sending it in and not having

1333
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:57,150
an idea and I don't like having it in

1334
01:06:54,869 --> 01:06:59,730
there for 36 hours or more than eight at

1335
01:06:57,150 --> 01:07:02,818
that so again it's just playing with

1336
01:06:59,730 --> 01:07:05,608
your product you know having the ability

1337
01:07:02,818 --> 01:07:07,650
to process the amount of material that

1338
01:07:05,608 --> 01:07:09,929
we we were privileged enough to process

1339
01:07:07,650 --> 01:07:12,630
gives us the ability to be more creative

1340
01:07:09,929 --> 01:07:15,358
gives us the ability to try new things

1341
01:07:12,630 --> 01:07:17,190
because as a as a home person who does

1342
01:07:15,358 --> 01:07:19,019
this and makes hash they're gonna get

1343
01:07:17,190 --> 01:07:22,700
five grams you know what I mean it's

1344
01:07:19,019 --> 01:07:22,699
like of pressable hash

1345
01:07:22,820 --> 01:07:29,220
someone posted something I think maybe

1346
01:07:26,519 --> 01:07:36,289
earlier today but soluble and

1347
01:07:29,219 --> 01:07:36,289
non-soluble turkeys are some I've never

1348
01:07:37,039 --> 01:07:52,980
terpenes water-soluble that what they're

1349
01:07:39,630 --> 01:07:56,300
asking I mean there's Lysol there's pine

1350
01:07:52,980 --> 01:07:59,190
saw all of those are terpene derived

1351
01:07:56,300 --> 01:08:01,830
products so they're mixed with water so

1352
01:07:59,190 --> 01:08:04,110
they must be water soluble in some form

1353
01:08:01,829 --> 01:08:06,809
that's a guess though you know we'd have

1354
01:08:04,110 --> 01:08:15,180
to go to google I don't know exactly

1355
01:08:06,809 --> 01:08:19,048
what the question is there but soluble

1356
01:08:15,179 --> 01:08:22,139
they are cow is that nice right so is

1357
01:08:19,048 --> 01:08:25,710
like carry ethylene insoluble Mersin

1358
01:08:22,140 --> 01:08:28,859
insoluble limonene slightly soluble

1359
01:08:25,710 --> 01:08:31,579
right which is why insoluble humulin

1360
01:08:28,859 --> 01:08:34,740
virtually insoluble in a little

1361
01:08:31,579 --> 01:08:37,710
installable knurl it all slightly

1362
01:08:34,739 --> 01:08:40,229
soluble and that's just what they know

1363
01:08:37,710 --> 01:08:42,149
so far but what are you using it for and

1364
01:08:40,229 --> 01:08:43,889
what reference is it to and it's like is

1365
01:08:42,149 --> 01:08:46,769
that that ice water than the soluble

1366
01:08:43,890 --> 01:08:51,690
ones like I said you guys make some Turk

1367
01:08:46,770 --> 01:08:53,580
water yeah I don't know exactly how that

1368
01:08:51,689 --> 01:08:55,439
works you know and why it smells that

1369
01:08:53,579 --> 01:08:59,789
way but I've never noticed like a major

1370
01:08:55,439 --> 01:09:01,169
I came out really good dude it's not the

1371
01:08:59,789 --> 01:09:03,180
yield that I would have wanted I

1372
01:09:01,170 --> 01:09:07,949
probably should have pressed harder and

1373
01:09:03,180 --> 01:09:09,869
it still got you killed it though dude

1374
01:09:07,949 --> 01:09:11,460
you got what it should be getting up in

1375
01:09:09,869 --> 01:09:13,048
the you know hi number you got 70

1376
01:09:11,460 --> 01:09:14,730
something new that's the hell of it was

1377
01:09:13,048 --> 01:09:16,920
like 76 that's good

1378
01:09:14,729 --> 01:09:25,429
that's the one dude I get 90 back on my

1379
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:29,039
GMO damn yeah it's insane this is how I

1380
01:09:25,430 --> 01:09:31,588
this is not dirt this is hash guys I

1381
01:09:29,039 --> 01:09:34,460
hate showing my bite my nails so much I

1382
01:09:31,588 --> 01:09:34,460
don't have any in there

1383
01:09:36,810 --> 01:09:41,489
my feet are gonna kill cancer bro these

1384
01:09:39,929 --> 01:09:42,868
I got another fucking hash in here to

1385
01:09:41,488 --> 01:09:45,238
kill cancer but it's embarrassing

1386
01:09:42,868 --> 01:09:47,309
because they're almost like stained like

1387
01:09:45,238 --> 01:09:51,539
I can't fucking making things I'd rather

1388
01:09:47,310 --> 01:09:54,000
always have gloves on but it's it's it's

1389
01:09:51,539 --> 01:09:56,368
it's part of the process you know I I

1390
01:09:54,000 --> 01:10:01,469
like you know touching stuff with my

1391
01:09:56,368 --> 01:10:03,679
hands and yeah this is this little ball

1392
01:10:01,469 --> 01:10:03,679
here

1393
01:10:03,890 --> 01:10:09,440
more of consist different different

1394
01:10:07,579 --> 01:10:11,329
textures and they're definitely

1395
01:10:09,439 --> 01:10:14,149
different textures this is a little bit

1396
01:10:11,329 --> 01:10:15,920
stickier it's gonna melt that's why when

1397
01:10:14,149 --> 01:10:17,738
I try to make a temple ball it just

1398
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:20,590
slowly

1399
01:10:17,738 --> 01:10:23,679
what up what bags are you using in your

1400
01:10:20,590 --> 01:10:26,680
my Roger technology never know do you

1401
01:10:23,680 --> 01:10:30,190
have a have you seen bolts bags they're

1402
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:32,440
uh they're freeze dryer liners oh they

1403
01:10:30,189 --> 01:10:34,089
have some yeah they're sick dude they

1404
01:10:32,439 --> 01:10:35,500
worked so good and he was telling me

1405
01:10:34,090 --> 01:10:37,329
about him like when we met the last time

1406
01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:39,729
and I totally had to try them out and

1407
01:10:37,329 --> 01:10:41,738
they they rock dude and it's so nice now

1408
01:10:39,729 --> 01:10:44,529
I'm gonna cut parchment for your for

1409
01:10:41,738 --> 01:10:46,509
your tray liners and you just like you

1410
01:10:44,529 --> 01:10:48,519
pull them out and you just shake it out

1411
01:10:46,510 --> 01:10:50,340
and what are you using it's a bolt bag

1412
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:53,110
but it's a train liner it's a trail

1413
01:10:50,340 --> 01:10:54,940
evolution make me custom trailer trailer

1414
01:10:53,109 --> 01:10:55,899
15 that's all they did that's what I you

1415
01:10:54,939 --> 01:10:59,199
that's what he did

1416
01:10:55,899 --> 01:11:02,170
they don't sell him I just had another I

1417
01:10:59,199 --> 01:11:04,479
was using the so you have that's what I

1418
01:11:02,170 --> 01:11:06,159
use but I don't think he hasn't for sale

1419
01:11:04,479 --> 01:11:08,468
yet I just had to make him form Oh

1420
01:11:06,159 --> 01:11:09,849
nobody old bags people guys does he saw

1421
01:11:08,469 --> 01:11:11,710
me that I had to yellow because I was

1422
01:11:09,850 --> 01:11:13,390
using the yellow ones right and so he's

1423
01:11:11,710 --> 01:11:15,100
like dude you need to use food-grade and

1424
01:11:13,390 --> 01:11:16,989
I'm like all right bro he's like what

1425
01:11:15,100 --> 01:11:18,969
are your sizes you know so I told him

1426
01:11:16,988 --> 01:11:21,309
the sizes might race and so he was

1427
01:11:18,969 --> 01:11:22,899
really nice and he sent me the 15 this

1428
01:11:21,310 --> 01:11:24,730
quality material basically this is what

1429
01:11:22,899 --> 01:11:26,469
I use yeah but it covered my whole tray

1430
01:11:24,729 --> 01:11:30,939
yeah and it's even sewn up on the

1431
01:11:26,469 --> 01:11:32,890
corners almost it's one this is the same

1432
01:11:30,939 --> 01:11:34,659
material that they make their wash bags

1433
01:11:32,890 --> 01:11:36,730
out of except this is the 15 year it's

1434
01:11:34,659 --> 01:11:39,250
just super low you so the hash isn't

1435
01:11:36,729 --> 01:11:41,649
seeping through but it tends to dry them

1436
01:11:39,250 --> 01:11:43,810
I see I feel like it dries a little

1437
01:11:41,649 --> 01:11:46,210
quicker and I like the parchment paper

1438
01:11:43,810 --> 01:11:47,980
wicks especially when you just bring

1439
01:11:46,210 --> 01:11:50,079
them it gets all like you know the

1440
01:11:47,979 --> 01:11:52,929
humidity in your room will mess up your

1441
01:11:50,079 --> 01:11:55,000
batch like that like I was checked I got

1442
01:11:52,930 --> 01:11:58,210
there I got temperature gauges all over

1443
01:11:55,000 --> 01:12:00,219
like at the doorway on there over here

1444
01:11:58,210 --> 01:12:03,399
because there's different temperatures

1445
01:12:00,219 --> 01:12:05,890
everywhere so you pull it out and if

1446
01:12:03,399 --> 01:12:07,988
your humidity is like 60% you know 50%

1447
01:12:05,890 --> 01:12:09,940
it was a rainy day you can't leave your

1448
01:12:07,988 --> 01:12:11,769
