2
00:00:09,558 --> 00:00:16,469
we just watched a panel on tissue

3
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:21,660
culture and one of the very last

4
00:00:16,469 --> 00:00:24,868
comments was that in like three to five

5
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:27,829
years breeding will be done at a

6
00:00:24,868 --> 00:00:31,230
molecular level like other plants and

7
00:00:27,829 --> 00:00:34,349
that the role of the current breeder who

8
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:39,480
basically breeds actual plants won't

9
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:43,230
really exist so I think there is gonna

10
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:45,718
be a lot of people that you know

11
00:00:43,229 --> 00:00:47,009
breeders breeders now I mean it's a lot

12
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:49,439
of people say they're breeders a lot of

13
00:00:47,009 --> 00:00:51,210
pollen chuckers you know a little pollen

14
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:53,280
chucking is going on people just

15
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:55,109
backyard breeding not doing any

16
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,520
selection I think those type of people

17
00:00:55,109 --> 00:00:58,320
yeah they're they're gonna be done but I

18
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,270
feel like the actual breeders they did

19
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,219
the real ones right now they're relevant

20
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:05,338
will still be relevant in five years I

21
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:07,260
think they have that potential it's you

22
00:01:05,338 --> 00:01:09,688
know it's kind of like they're gonna

23
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:12,299
work beside my vision is they'll work

24
00:01:09,688 --> 00:01:14,188
side by side with the guys that are

25
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:17,820
doing molecular to help you know

26
00:01:14,188 --> 00:01:19,769
understand and develop the SOPs kind of

27
00:01:17,819 --> 00:01:22,469
drive drive the breeding because I feel

28
00:01:19,769 --> 00:01:24,658
like it's a kind of swore thing you know

29
00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:27,239
maybe I'll be proven wrong but I really

30
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:29,490
I really you know being a breeder I sure

31
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:32,459
hope I'm still relevant five years yeah

32
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:34,019
I mean I agree I think instead of

33
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:36,179
working with plants you'll be working

34
00:01:34,019 --> 00:01:37,859
with scientists sure but you'll still be

35
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:39,960
relevant in the same way you're relevant

36
00:01:37,859 --> 00:01:43,109
and turn like with plants you're still

37
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:46,289
the one to say we we bred it we grew it

38
00:01:43,109 --> 00:01:48,299
out I approve that's good shit yeah like

39
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:51,180
that scientist dude or the business guy

40
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:52,470
in that well in me I won't be the one to

41
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:55,310
make that decision I'm probably not

42
00:01:52,469 --> 00:01:58,468
going to be breeding the high THC or the

43
00:01:55,310 --> 00:02:00,090
minor cannabinoid you know breeding

44
00:01:58,468 --> 00:02:04,169
projects that some people will be able

45
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:06,060
to do with molecular processes you know

46
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:08,128
the caste 9 and CRISPR and stuff like

47
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:09,628
that yeah that's that's not my expertise

48
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:12,509
but working with those people and

49
00:02:09,628 --> 00:02:13,590
helping them understand the plant I feel

50
00:02:12,509 --> 00:02:14,818
like

51
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:18,090
they're stuffed it's gonna work

52
00:02:14,818 --> 00:02:19,949
synergistically I feel like a lot of

53
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:21,360
people were afraid of crisper and cast 9

54
00:02:19,949 --> 00:02:24,179
and the kind of direction that that's

55
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,709
going in you know these people GMO

56
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:27,300
they're freaked out about genetically

57
00:02:25,709 --> 00:02:29,069
modifying stuff but I feel like they're

58
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,660
they've been doing in hops they've been

59
00:02:29,068 --> 00:02:32,598
doing it a lot of things and I'm really

60
00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:38,310
interested to kind of see what it drinks

61
00:02:32,598 --> 00:02:42,628
talk about the man who just passed and

62
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:46,590
his contribution what he means to you

63
00:02:42,628 --> 00:02:49,768
and his legacy as a breeder so it's

64
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:51,539
funny because his impact was so great

65
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:53,909
and I feel like most people can't even

66
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:57,179
really comprehend how big of an impact

67
00:02:53,909 --> 00:02:59,068
nevels contributions were it took me an

68
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:00,480
actual date or right opposed about

69
00:02:59,068 --> 00:03:02,399
Instagram because I really want to think

70
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:04,348
about you know all the stuff all the

71
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,810
work he's done and you know the

72
00:03:04,348 --> 00:03:10,369
development of haze strains you know

73
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:12,870
solely responsible for a lot of it

74
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:14,189
Neville haze super Silver Haze the

75
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:16,890
development with green house was super

76
00:03:14,189 --> 00:03:19,139
Silver Haze I mean that's dream its

77
00:03:16,889 --> 00:03:22,078
impact he changed generations you know

78
00:03:19,139 --> 00:03:24,150
and he affected you know on a large

79
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:26,519
scale more than anybody else in the

80
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:28,560
industry anything else that anybody's

81
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:31,489
done like his contributions are greater

82
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:34,889
you know and we may so he's like the

83
00:03:31,489 --> 00:03:37,139
what is it the jingis con is like his

84
00:03:34,889 --> 00:03:40,310
DNA is attacked because he had sex with

85
00:03:37,139 --> 00:03:43,230
so many she's like a genius kind of

86
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:45,629
canopy on Europe especially you know and

87
00:03:43,229 --> 00:03:47,759
I feel like people in the states don't

88
00:03:45,629 --> 00:03:49,348
really have an appreciation for Hays and

89
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:51,388
most people that have seen it haven't

90
00:03:49,348 --> 00:03:52,738
seen it ground properly they like over

91
00:03:51,389 --> 00:03:56,969
in Europe if you've been able to spend

92
00:03:52,739 --> 00:04:00,180
time in Europe in you know Amsterdam the

93
00:03:56,969 --> 00:04:01,919
Netherlands in Spain in Italy even like

94
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:05,909
you'll see haze or you'll see haze

95
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:08,010
isolator or hashes and you know growing

96
00:04:05,909 --> 00:04:11,639
properly is some of the most amazing you

97
00:04:08,009 --> 00:04:15,449
know amazing strains on the earth it's a

98
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:16,978
but it's funny because haze is a

99
00:04:15,449 --> 00:04:18,329
particular thing that not everybody

100
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:22,680
agrees with because our bodies are so

101
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:24,960
unique it's something like my wife is

102
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,459
not a huge haze fan although she's big

103
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:27,430
and it's like if she'll smoke a little

104
00:04:26,459 --> 00:04:30,609
bit of haze so she can

105
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:32,228
the house stuff like that well yeah and

106
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:36,788
then other people it's like too much for

107
00:04:32,228 --> 00:04:38,589
them so it's really interesting the

108
00:04:36,788 --> 00:04:42,099
direction it's gone and I feel like we

109
00:04:38,589 --> 00:04:44,829
have guys like short Brooks and Mojave

110
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:46,780
and karma and these guys are gonna kind

111
00:04:44,829 --> 00:04:49,258
of continue with the breeding I mean

112
00:04:46,779 --> 00:04:51,429
I've done breeding with super silver and

113
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:52,930
would like to get so especially after

114
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:55,689
Neville's passing we'd like to get some

115
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:58,180
more genetics back into like the mix as

116
00:04:55,689 --> 00:04:59,889
well but yeah so I believe shorts doing

117
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:03,090
a huge breeding project on Hayes

118
00:04:59,889 --> 00:05:05,500
specifically isolating some phenotypes

119
00:05:03,089 --> 00:05:10,359
they're doing a huge Dino hunts down in

120
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:15,089
Arizona like if you reflect on him was

121
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:17,788
he like a mentor yeah I think I think

122
00:05:15,089 --> 00:05:21,879
were you friends with him too you know

123
00:05:17,788 --> 00:05:23,348
but I felt his impacts you know and I I

124
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:25,449
just I've appreciated the boys

125
00:05:23,348 --> 00:05:28,629
impressive lineage you know and yeah

126
00:05:25,449 --> 00:05:30,610
it's it's one thing that's you know it's

127
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:32,769
affected you know I feel like chem dog

128
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:33,610
also is another strain that was a bad

129
00:05:32,769 --> 00:05:36,009
seed by the way

130
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:38,650
haze was actually developed I feel like

131
00:05:36,009 --> 00:05:41,050
there's a handful of real breeders out

132
00:05:38,649 --> 00:05:42,819
there that have really bred the plant

133
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:45,129
and worked with the plant and improve

134
00:05:42,819 --> 00:05:46,629
the genetics over time Neville's one of

135
00:05:45,129 --> 00:05:48,848
them Simon from serious seeds actually

136
00:05:46,629 --> 00:05:51,250
took from like p1 landraces

137
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:54,939
he started with two land races created

138
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:57,069
real F ones most people think like f1 is

139
00:05:54,939 --> 00:05:58,990
something we see every day but it's what

140
00:05:57,069 --> 00:06:01,658
we're seeing these f1 poly hybrids that

141
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:03,639
have really complex genetics in them you

142
00:06:01,658 --> 00:06:05,139
know and a lot of over breeding then

143
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:07,329
with specific strains like og and

144
00:06:05,139 --> 00:06:09,728
cookies now it's kind of what's

145
00:06:07,329 --> 00:06:12,399
happening I think the interesting thing

146
00:06:09,728 --> 00:06:13,689
back over in Europe especially in the

147
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:15,579
Netherlands is there was a time where

148
00:06:13,689 --> 00:06:17,620
haze just dominated everything people

149
00:06:15,579 --> 00:06:20,529
found it they fell in love with it and

150
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:23,800
it went from these really long flowering

151
00:06:20,529 --> 00:06:27,158
Hayes's to amnesia but it was still haze

152
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:31,689
for a long time it's interesting to kind

153
00:06:27,158 --> 00:06:34,839
of see like the fragmentation globally

154
00:06:31,689 --> 00:06:36,788
of cannabis like what people appreciate

155
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:38,769
like you're saying in Europe they

156
00:06:36,788 --> 00:06:39,819
appreciate things that here people just

157
00:06:38,769 --> 00:06:41,859
it's

158
00:06:39,819 --> 00:06:45,579
subjective it's just like real Moroccan

159
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:47,740
hash or red Lebanon like the red

160
00:06:45,579 --> 00:06:49,000
Lebanese or you know any of these

161
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:50,439
different hashes like we don't

162
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,879
appreciate them in the States we don't

163
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:54,819
really have access to them like they do

164
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:57,040
in here but uh you know our standards

165
00:06:54,819 --> 00:06:58,569
are very different and what we think of

166
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:00,220
as quality is so different and that's

167
00:06:58,569 --> 00:07:02,259
one thing that makes Canada so beautiful

168
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:05,770
is it's so subjective just like food

169
00:07:02,259 --> 00:07:07,120
food wine beer it's so subjective to the

170
00:07:05,769 --> 00:07:08,049
actual individuals that there's almost

171
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:12,180
something for everybody

172
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:15,490
ya know my my introduction to hash was I

173
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:18,129
lived in France for two years the first

174
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:22,150
year was in high school when I was 16 so

175
00:07:18,129 --> 00:07:24,459
I was like by myself no family you're

176
00:07:22,149 --> 00:07:26,829
drinking and then like you're not

177
00:07:24,459 --> 00:07:31,089
smoking weed you're smoking spliff

178
00:07:26,829 --> 00:07:33,339
Moroccan hash with yeah tobacco and as

179
00:07:31,089 --> 00:07:38,339
someone who smokes weed that shit

180
00:07:33,339 --> 00:07:38,339
knocked me out like I couldn't handle it

181
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:47,829
I don't normally smoke tobacco but just

182
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:49,540
everything everything well the other

183
00:07:47,829 --> 00:07:52,839
thing is like there is never any weed

184
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:55,300
around no you're talking about like

185
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:57,339
stuff they're growing and a breeze or

186
00:07:55,300 --> 00:08:00,250
have grown and appreciate in Europe and

187
00:07:57,339 --> 00:08:02,909
in my head I'm like where was it all cuz

188
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:06,579
coffee shops coffee

189
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:07,930
you know Spain it was available in Spain

190
00:08:06,579 --> 00:08:10,959
but it was really people were in the

191
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:12,610
shadows for a long time until the last

192
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:14,349
five years when people started opening

193
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:17,699
coffee got coffee shops with social

194
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:20,260
clubs in Spain you know it's it's really

195
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:22,269
and it's funny because the quality has

196
00:08:20,259 --> 00:08:24,459
just progressed so much in Spain whereas

197
00:08:22,269 --> 00:08:28,089
Amsterdam is kind of stagnating it's

198
00:08:24,459 --> 00:08:30,250
regressed well it really hasn't grown I

199
00:08:28,089 --> 00:08:33,039
feel like I went to Amsterdam for the

200
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:34,330
first time in five years and when I went

201
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,968
back it was almost exactly the same

202
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:38,710
coffee shop same layout all my

203
00:08:36,969 --> 00:08:41,800
restaurants pretty much we're still

204
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:46,330
there so really interesting red light

205
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:50,169
was a lot smaller I'm still thinking

206
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:52,700
about like being 16 and then

207
00:08:50,169 --> 00:08:55,219
yeah it was probably think mostly was

208
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:57,259
mixing the tobacco yeah so I smoked

209
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:58,580
chili I don't smoke tobacco at all so my

210
00:08:57,259 --> 00:09:01,580
friend was diagnosed with esophageal

211
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:05,870
cancer last year and so I quit tobacco

212
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:07,639
completely no once you know just no

213
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:11,179
tobacco I don't you know I don't need it

214
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:13,309
and it doesn't really give me joy and if

215
00:09:11,179 --> 00:09:16,909
it's bad for me why would I consume it

216
00:09:13,309 --> 00:09:20,989
so cigar is nice yeah why so I have a

217
00:09:16,909 --> 00:09:25,129
humidor that has 500 cigars but if

218
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:26,180
you're not smart idea every time people

219
00:09:25,129 --> 00:09:28,939
come over my house I give them cigars

220
00:09:26,179 --> 00:09:30,500
but I quit smoking and then I go to

221
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:32,690
Europe and my friends like you want

222
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:34,429
smoke kill them and I'm like well I

223
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:36,260
don't smoke tobacco but fuck it let's

224
00:09:34,429 --> 00:09:38,659
let's do it it's you know and it's

225
00:09:36,259 --> 00:09:40,279
basically sterile to a degree the

226
00:09:38,659 --> 00:09:42,439
tobacco that goes in there it's just a

227
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:44,779
you know it's like a little basket to

228
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:46,160
put the hash in when you're smoking it

229
00:09:44,779 --> 00:09:48,769
but it still gets you really high like

230
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:50,569
that's some of the most high I've ever

231
00:09:48,769 --> 00:09:53,090
in my life is from smoking chilling with

232
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:56,060
friends my whole point like I went from

233
00:09:53,090 --> 00:10:00,050
like so I went in high school and then

234
00:09:56,059 --> 00:10:02,179
again in college and it was like you're

235
00:10:00,049 --> 00:10:05,389
like I smoked a lot of weed and then you

236
00:10:02,179 --> 00:10:07,639
go there and and we would go I'd go out

237
00:10:05,389 --> 00:10:10,549
with my French friends and before we go

238
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:12,500
into a club we'd smoke yeah and I'd be

239
00:10:10,549 --> 00:10:14,299
like you know what I'm just gonna hang

240
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,649
out in the car you guys go in the club

241
00:10:14,299 --> 00:10:17,659
like I couldn't move and they're like

242
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:19,730
all right dude you're sure you're cool

243
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:23,750
in the car like see you later and be

244
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:25,220
like now I'm good yeah it's a trip but

245
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:29,210
most of those guys can't hang with us

246
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:30,889
pure smokers right so like they're like

247
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:34,550
they'll take a hit at the pier there and

248
00:10:30,889 --> 00:10:36,830
that's it for the day well yeah and I

249
00:10:34,549 --> 00:10:39,459
really appreciate I get to smoke to 20

250
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:42,470
year old Moroccan when I was in Spain

251
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:44,720
yeah Martin barrows clubs so this brings

252
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:50,029
me to the Frenchy comment of hash gets

253
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:51,649
better with age so and go and go I don't

254
00:10:50,029 --> 00:10:53,629
it's a 20 year old house

255
00:10:51,649 --> 00:10:58,088
we smoked 20 year-old Moroccan it was

256
00:10:53,629 --> 00:10:58,088
held by a Moroccan that was there and

257
00:10:58,139 --> 00:11:03,689
it tasted good it tasted fair it didn't

258
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:05,580
have a lot of flavor I feel like it

259
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:07,650
loses something you know like I feel

260
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:09,389
like it just like wine wine has an

261
00:11:07,649 --> 00:11:13,709
expiration date where it goes over and

262
00:11:09,389 --> 00:11:15,569
they even red wine so it was smooth but

263
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:16,320
there wasn't a lot to it it wasn't like

264
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:19,470
that

265
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:21,629
I like that fresh creamy especially that

266
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:25,320
creamy smoke that you get from really

267
00:11:21,629 --> 00:11:28,259
good hash but since the sample size was

268
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:30,570
one you'd almost need like a hundred

269
00:11:28,259 --> 00:11:32,879
different sort of hashes to be stored

270
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:34,680
for twenty years and then to see if some

271
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:37,710
of them like because like with red wine

272
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:40,109
some peek seven years later seven to ten

273
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:41,400
somewhere like tell you can the lipid

274
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:44,129
content there are so many different

275
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:45,840
things like you're looking at lipids the

276
00:11:44,129 --> 00:11:47,370
tract the terpenes that are in there

277
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,950
terpenes will help degrade it depending

278
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:51,690
on what type of terpenes are in there

279
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:56,129
but you know I think the sweet point

280
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:59,160
that I know the cat's point is two years

281
00:11:56,129 --> 00:12:01,379
I smoked some two-year-old Moroccan hash

282
00:11:59,159 --> 00:12:04,079
that was probably the best hash I've

283
00:12:01,379 --> 00:12:06,029
ever smoked no and right up there with

284
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:08,820
in strength-wise right up there with the

285
00:12:06,029 --> 00:12:11,399
best Isolators that I've smoked but but

286
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:14,040
so to Frenchie's point that's huge

287
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:16,019
because that means that here's a product

288
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:19,409
within the cat the broad cannabis

289
00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:21,720
product sweet yeah that actually gets

290
00:12:19,409 --> 00:12:23,879
better with age yeah and Frenchy creates

291
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:27,420
a boutique product it's like you just

292
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:29,730
don't see it it's a it's a it's it's a

293
00:12:27,419 --> 00:12:30,750
lost art there's people definitely that

294
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:32,129
are trying to carry it out but it's like

295
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:34,019
glittery but trees another one of those

296
00:12:32,129 --> 00:12:35,639
things how many peopie debauchery but

297
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:36,990
how many people do you know that they

298
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:38,009
know how to breakdown animal well it's

299
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:41,000
also I think one of the interesting

300
00:12:38,009 --> 00:12:44,159
things I learned about butchery is like

301
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,899
in the u.s. supermarket we have all

302
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:49,829
these generic cuts but there's like

303
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:53,039
innovation and cuts right and like we we

304
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:57,900
only gravitate to like five six

305
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:59,639
different cuts that it's like finally

306
00:12:57,899 --> 00:13:00,840
understanding that there are more cuts

307
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:02,279
than the ones I always see in the

308
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,509
grocery store yeah and that they're

309
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:04,740
actually pretty cool I'm good

310
00:13:03,509 --> 00:13:06,330
when everywhere you go in the world the

311
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:07,320
cuts are different like being at you go

312
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:09,360
over to Europe they're completely

313
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:11,220
different from over here and then

314
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,089
they're called different things and the

315
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:14,339
way they section is

316
00:13:12,089 --> 00:13:16,649
a little bit differently but you know I

317
00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:20,220
totally forget why we were on the top

318
00:13:16,649 --> 00:13:22,438
again it's that Girl Scout cookies but

319
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:24,120
uh no so we were talking about it

320
00:13:22,438 --> 00:13:26,549
because French connote Frenchie yeah

321
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:28,589
it's a dying art it's something that

322
00:13:26,549 --> 00:13:32,338
will be preserved by some but only a

323
00:13:28,589 --> 00:13:35,160
handful you know it's like these people

324
00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:37,829
are stewards of the lost art of - making

325
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:40,620
what so I mean he's doing his courses so

326
00:13:37,828 --> 00:13:43,979
do you feel like in those court like he

327
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:46,799
spent what I love about his story is the

328
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:50,100
way I understand it is here's this crazy

329
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:51,958
old French dude who spent 40 years like

330
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:53,730
a hummingbird going to every hash

331
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:56,248
producing region of the world and

332
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:59,370
learning each of their respective hash

333
00:13:56,249 --> 00:14:01,680
making total methodologies and then

334
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:03,980
which none of them do like Moroccans

335
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:07,409
aren't hanging out in Thailand you're

336
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:10,230
right he's like the one guy in the world

337
00:14:07,409 --> 00:14:12,929
who's actually done that and now can

338
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:15,209
synthesize like what do you like it's

339
00:14:12,929 --> 00:14:18,799
it's like an MMA fighter who's fluent

340
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:22,138
and like wrestling my Thai kick boxing

341
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:24,328
Wing Chun in the quality of his stuff I

342
00:14:22,139 --> 00:14:26,278
mean the price of it speaks for itself

343
00:14:24,328 --> 00:14:28,799

367
00:15:25,419 --> 00:15:29,740
but he was talking about a new process

368
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:32,950

369
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:35,980
you as he talks so so you know so John

370
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:37,090
and I flew up to Oregon with a bunch of

371
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:38,649
other people with the company I work

372
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:40,240
with Newbridge they flew us up there and

373
00:15:38,649 --> 00:15:41,799
they John gave a president oh you're

374
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:45,340
working with new because he's with me

375
00:15:41,799 --> 00:15:47,079
but yeah I'm we're doing you are all

376
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:48,629
right so I got the same company we're

377
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:52,210
the same company yeah Jonathan all right

378
00:15:48,629 --> 00:15:56,950
we're good guys so it's funny cuz so

379
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:59,500
Newbridge is like this this team of like

380
00:15:56,950 --> 00:16:01,960
top industry elite people we got it

381
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:05,379
Silas his name's always weren't a dank

382
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:06,700
on Instagram but Silas is in my opinion

383
00:16:05,379 --> 00:16:09,399
one of the top cultivators in the world

384
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:11,830
it's the guy who started the company no

385
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:13,750
he is not guy so he is the cultivator I

386
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:15,690
do genetics Eric Tran is the guy who

387
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:19,350
started the company eric is also

388
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:22,600
industry elite very business minded

389
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:23,909
super professional and super calculating

390
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:28,029
it's a great guy to have on your side

391
00:16:23,909 --> 00:16:30,969
yeah yeah he said you actually respect

392
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:34,240
the guys who started the company I do

393
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:37,210
okay so yeah we're not thinking of like

394
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:38,710
all the big like yeah companies and it's

395
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:41,740
like all these finance guys and they

396
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:43,420
roll up a bunch of other companies and

397
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:45,940
so he's a black market guy like he came

398
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:48,429
from the black Eric Eric Eric came well

399
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:49,960
we all did yeah except John I came from

400
00:16:48,429 --> 00:16:51,339
one in that company but a lot of the

401
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,930
companies that's like dudes who came

402
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:55,180
from Goldman snags we came from wherever

403
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:57,629
yeah no and I think that's one thing

404
00:16:55,179 --> 00:17:00,399
that kind of separates us apart from

405
00:16:57,629 --> 00:17:02,620
some of these other big companies that's

406
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:04,569
an industry people industry people we're

407
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:08,890
on it the same we were in the shadows

408
00:17:04,569 --> 00:17:10,328
together you know and especially you

409
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:12,730
know Oakland was kind of an innovative

410
00:17:10,328 --> 00:17:15,039
place in its own in its own right

411
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:19,930
Oakland kind of was a boundary-pushing

412
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:22,680
community the Oaksterdam you know we

413
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:25,120
kind of paved the way for legalization

414
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:26,740
you know it's pretty impressive what's

415
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:28,239
going on over there but with Newbridge

416
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:31,660
Newbridge is kind of pushing boundaries

417
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:33,370
especially with putting together like

418
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:35,890
these superstar teams right so we got a

419
00:17:33,369 --> 00:17:38,769
lady who really knows what she's doing

420
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:40,509
her name's B B Scott she runs the

421
00:17:38,769 --> 00:17:42,639
she's part of the team so what she does

422
00:17:40,509 --> 00:17:45,250
is she runs the nursery's she does

423
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:48,640
large-scale you know nursery production

424
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:50,680
and she's all about better where she has

425
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:53,410
roots in Oakland that's coming out and

426
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:55,480
she has the Bay cloner II and the Bay

427
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:57,100
clownery is in Santa Rosa 12,000 square

428
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:58,930
foot facility that should be ready later

429
00:17:57,099 --> 00:18:00,639
this year where I'll be working with her

430
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:02,380
she's absolutely amazing and she how

431
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:05,770
long has she been running a nursery for

432
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:07,450
she's been I think around 10 years I've

433
00:18:05,769 --> 00:18:09,549
been working and then you know with

434
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:11,559
cultivation and nursery but her clones

435
00:18:09,549 --> 00:18:15,099
are by far like the best clones I've

436
00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:16,990
seen so she understands the process and

437
00:18:15,099 --> 00:18:19,719
she doesn't skip steps and I love her

438
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:22,150
was it Voltron where like all the

439
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:24,039
individual robots came together as one

440
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:25,570
big robot yeah and we're gonna create

441
00:18:24,039 --> 00:18:27,670
one badass boutique branding right

442
00:18:25,569 --> 00:18:30,220
that's two that's the metaphor or

443
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:33,759
analogy I'm painting yeah and I feel

444
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:37,110
like yeah and Eric is really basically

445
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:38,349
Eric's like I'm doping this skill set

446
00:18:37,109 --> 00:18:41,500
yeah

447
00:18:38,349 --> 00:18:43,240
you guys bring green and genetic so you

448
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:45,640
got the nursery skills you got to

449
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:47,019
whatever yeah okay so that's what the

450
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:51,660
company is all about and so you're all

451
00:18:47,019 --> 00:18:54,279
like everyone has equity and everyone is

452
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:56,320
exactly like Eric's the guy who started

453
00:18:54,279 --> 00:19:00,099
it but you're all really good what Eric

454
00:18:56,319 --> 00:19:03,669
is yeah he is uh he's the decision-maker

455
00:19:00,099 --> 00:19:07,179
the cheerleader the shows are like our

456
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:09,250
loud seeds under that umbrella so well I

457
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:12,100
can't really talk about that right now

458
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:15,849
so loud see it yeah you say loud ceases

459
00:19:12,099 --> 00:19:17,559
going with another direction they were

460
00:19:15,849 --> 00:19:19,569
we're working it out with the company

461
00:19:17,559 --> 00:19:21,609
called next Green Wave the acquiring of

462
00:19:19,569 --> 00:19:25,539
loud teeth so loud seeds may go with

463
00:19:21,609 --> 00:19:27,659
them we'll see okay well that's big so

464
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:30,039
that means that the company your baby

465
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:33,610
yeah they sell to someone else

466
00:19:30,039 --> 00:19:35,680
yes but it's it's funny because I have a

467
00:19:33,609 --> 00:19:38,079
the ganja farmer seed company I have

468
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:39,549

470
00:19:39,549 --> 00:19:43,149
little collaboration that we're actually

471

separately right I do

478
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:56,980
I do consulting like for cultivo so I

479
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:58,660
did genetic consulting for them yeah

480
00:19:56,980 --> 00:20:02,589
I've been in talks with several other

481
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:05,769
companies abroad and here for genetic

482
00:20:02,589 --> 00:20:08,589
consulting so I so talk about give me

483
00:20:05,769 --> 00:20:10,720
like a genetic consulting like example

484
00:20:08,589 --> 00:20:13,209
or case study like you watch so Columbia

485
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:15,940
so Columbia is interesting you know

486
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:17,590
getting genetics down there fee no

487
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:19,950
hunting potentially I think there's

488
00:20:17,589 --> 00:20:22,389
there's big talks of fee no hunting and

489
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:23,799
getting specific cultivars and stuff

490
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:25,330
that works within their climates I also

491
00:20:23,799 --> 00:20:27,549
do why are you still learning what works

492
00:20:25,329 --> 00:20:29,259
well there I think they are still

493
00:20:27,549 --> 00:20:32,139
learning I haven't been down there so

494
00:20:29,259 --> 00:20:34,240
I've because at some point you'll need

495
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:36,880
to like be like this is the shit that

496
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:39,609
will grow well here yeah first in your

497
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:41,170
perfect growing and so so we've been

498
00:20:39,609 --> 00:20:42,219
talking about Auto flowers in Columbia

499
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:43,779
and people are like why would you bring

500
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:45,279
out a flowers down to Columbia I also

501
00:20:43,779 --> 00:20:47,079
breed out a flowers that's one of the

502
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:49,450
things I do right now which is unique in

503
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:50,710
the US right it is unique in the US but

504
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:52,500
it's starting to become more popular

505
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:56,440
especially for large scale cultivation

506
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:58,660
it's very like Europe is bigger and

507
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:01,240
autoflowering than the US or like

508
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:03,190
history historically if it was a

509
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:05,319
complete like I mean in France and

510
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:06,730
you'll see people grow it like dime

511
00:21:05,319 --> 00:21:08,589
France but like in Barcelona there's

512
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:10,630
people in in their apartments that have

513
00:21:08,589 --> 00:21:12,039
Auto flowers just you know their porches

514
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:15,160
outside where you can look up and you

515
00:21:12,039 --> 00:21:16,990
see their autofocus so the typical

516
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:18,700
grower in America does not grow auto

517
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:20,349
Farsi will go buy feminized or they'll

518
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:23,710
go buy regular but the last thing most

519
00:21:20,349 --> 00:21:25,629
people do but it is catching up I mean I

520
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:28,029
think you can see statistically through

521
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:30,280
some of the seed banks that are selling

522
00:21:28,029 --> 00:21:31,779
the auto flower seeds like ISO these

523
00:21:30,279 --> 00:21:33,309
guys are starting to sell more auto

524
00:21:31,779 --> 00:21:35,200
flower seeds and some of these companies

525
00:21:33,309 --> 00:21:38,139
that make auto flower seeds in Europe

526
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:40,930
you know they'd be 50% of their sales in

527
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:46,660
Auto flour 50 percent in feminized no

528
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:50,170
regular so what's are you so me I'm

529
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:53,350
doing for large large scale for Ag so

530
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:56,320
that's auto flower I feel like is the

531
00:21:53,349 --> 00:21:57,789
future for certain scenarios I don't

532
00:21:56,319 --> 00:22:00,720
think it's right for everybody but I

533
00:21:57,789 --> 00:22:03,490
think in in the given circumstance where

534
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:05,289
your problems with mold and mildew if

535
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:06,730
you have to tarp in specific times a

536
00:22:05,289 --> 00:22:10,569
year Auto flowers are ideal

537
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:15,250
so if like October or like September

538
00:22:10,569 --> 00:22:17,859
October or super-moist sure you want to

539
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:19,839
come early you want to come early yeah

540
00:22:17,859 --> 00:22:22,599
okay well ah no flowers can also if you

541
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:27,009
start them in May you can do two seasons

542
00:22:22,599 --> 00:22:28,240
trip yeah I think there's people that

543
00:22:27,009 --> 00:22:30,819
are afraid of autumn flowers they think

544
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:33,220
they're shit I think for biomass they

545
00:22:30,819 --> 00:22:34,899
are one of the most ideal situations

546
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:36,519
especially if they're stabilized or

547
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:38,590
there's very little phenotypical

548
00:22:36,519 --> 00:22:41,170
variation so what's he smoking oh wait

549
00:22:38,589 --> 00:22:43,659
so yeah we're talking about one point we

550
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:45,789
were talking about live rosin so Silas

551
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:47,320
is the one in Sarnia really turned me on

552
00:22:45,789 --> 00:22:50,200
to live rods and especially in the last

553
00:22:47,319 --> 00:22:51,759
like six months I always run an egg so

554
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:54,220
trichome heavy extracts that's the

555
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:56,950
company he works with but he grows some

556
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:59,259
of the best best cannabis I've seen on

557
00:22:56,950 --> 00:23:01,210
the planet where does he grow he's gonna

558
00:22:59,259 --> 00:23:05,200
be growing for Newbridge so Silas

559
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:09,130
no-till organic living soil absolutely

560
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:11,710
amazing super super greasy pot like the

561
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:17,020
cannabis the flower is so greasy it's

562
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:20,680
ridiculous like next level but where so

563
00:23:17,019 --> 00:23:23,619
where was he growing so I believe he was

564
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:25,509
going on a medical side over he's in

565
00:23:23,619 --> 00:23:28,389
California in California oh yeah in like

566
00:23:25,509 --> 00:23:28,690
Mendocino or no I think more towards the

567
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:32,020
desert

568
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:33,940
so in the terpene profiles so so Silas

569
00:23:32,019 --> 00:23:35,589
but the thing is is like bee and Silas

570
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:38,019
and I we we all connect on this one

571
00:23:35,589 --> 00:23:39,789
level right where we all agree on GMO is

572
00:23:38,019 --> 00:23:41,410
amazing now I think there's a lot of

573
00:23:39,789 --> 00:23:44,259
people out there I don't know GMO

574
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:47,560
cookies if you're familiar with a garlic

575
00:23:44,259 --> 00:23:51,490
cookies it's a chem D times thin Nate

576
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:53,919
Girl Scouts and it has a very specific

577
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:55,769
terpene profile that they that he gets

578
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:58,330
from the chem dee not from the cookies

579
00:23:55,769 --> 00:24:01,299
the cookies add some back notes to it

580
00:23:58,329 --> 00:24:02,379
but it is just one of the it smells like

581
00:24:01,299 --> 00:24:04,509
dirty armpits

582
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:07,090
it smells like going to a Grateful Dead

583
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:08,619
show on a hot day that's how I feel

584
00:24:07,089 --> 00:24:11,500
about the smell it's like a cheese

585
00:24:08,619 --> 00:24:13,719
fountain not not cheese no no more like

586
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:17,220
more of like a fuck I think you can kind

587
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:17,220
of smell it with this this right here

588
00:24:17,339 --> 00:24:20,470
it's it almost burns your nose a little

589
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:28,048
bit right but it's

590
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:28,048
that yeah that's good right but it also

591
00:24:28,349 --> 00:24:34,808
yeah and I was like good armpit yeah but

592
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:35,319
yeah so I feel like it's an acquired

593
00:24:34,808 --> 00:24:38,908
taste

594
00:24:35,319 --> 00:24:41,408
it's it's a something that most new

595
00:24:38,909 --> 00:24:42,880
smokers don't appreciate you know it's

596
00:24:41,409 --> 00:24:44,409
like it's cat piss is another one where

597
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,289
like just the name turns people off

598
00:24:44,409 --> 00:24:48,789
they're like I want to smoke no Kappas

599
00:24:46,288 --> 00:24:51,069
we haven't seen campus in a while like

600
00:24:48,788 --> 00:24:54,490
the real one but that was like super

601
00:24:51,069 --> 00:24:56,798
ammonia it's a nl5 haze yeah it was

602
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:58,659
ammonia but the thing is is the the cat

603
00:24:56,798 --> 00:25:00,099
pissed that we had 20 years ago you

604
00:24:58,659 --> 00:25:01,539
would have 1/10 of a gram in your pocket

605
00:25:00,099 --> 00:25:02,709
and you Andy scrambling around your room

606
00:25:01,538 --> 00:25:05,319
trying to find it cuz it smelled so

607
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:06,900
strong sure there's no weed I know that

608
00:25:05,319 --> 00:25:09,908
if you have 1/10 of a gram right now

609
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:11,590
tenth of a gram that it's gonna smell

610
00:25:09,909 --> 00:25:13,120
your whole room up to where you start

611
00:25:11,589 --> 00:25:16,149
panicking because your parents are gonna

612
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:18,428
find it right so yeah it's funny and I

613
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:19,840
think that's the big the big step that

614
00:25:18,429 --> 00:25:23,590
people were gonna do next I mean I feel

615
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:26,500
like my buddy John that's up and then

616
00:25:23,589 --> 00:25:27,879
though he's doing it I'm trying to do it

617
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:30,250
we're trying to go to these landrace

618
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:32,620
varieties and incorporate them back in

619
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:34,960
or at least closer to Landry's I feel

620
00:25:32,619 --> 00:25:37,569
like the stuff that's going on with all

621
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:39,279
the wedding cakes and all the the

622
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:41,079
sherbert crosses and all these new

623
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:42,548
things they're great and people love

624
00:25:41,079 --> 00:25:45,009
them but what we need is genetic

625
00:25:42,548 --> 00:25:47,408
diversity back into the cannabis it's

626
00:25:45,009 --> 00:25:49,240
just it's the one thing that's missing

627
00:25:47,409 --> 00:25:51,340
and it's the one thing that over time it

628
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:53,710
causes genetic depression what's and

629
00:25:51,339 --> 00:25:55,808
does that come from something becoming

630
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:56,980
super popular in the market wanting it

631
00:25:55,808 --> 00:25:59,319
and then everyone thinking they need to

632
00:25:56,980 --> 00:26:02,019
cross with it to call it come up with

633
00:25:59,319 --> 00:26:04,029
their own version of it oh yeah that's

634
00:26:02,019 --> 00:26:07,210
exactly what it is and so what happens

635
00:26:04,029 --> 00:26:08,980
is we either are putting OGIS or cookies

636
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:10,900
and bringing everything it seems like

637
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:12,730
everybody's doing that it's like ok so

638
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:14,740
you just put it oh gee on another Oh

639
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:15,519
Jean you got a new oh gee well it

640
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:18,009
doesn't work like that

641
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:20,619
and then like Joan Rivers shoulder-pads

642
00:26:18,009 --> 00:26:24,339
it goes out of style as the 80s come to

643
00:26:20,619 --> 00:26:26,349
a close right and well and then the

644
00:26:24,339 --> 00:26:29,740
thing is is so many people are like I

645
00:26:26,349 --> 00:26:32,798
only like cookies or I only like og and

646
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:34,269
I have a very like open palette I like

647
00:26:32,798 --> 00:26:35,710
all that I like good cannabis

648
00:26:34,269 --> 00:26:38,289
doesn't matter whether it's a haze or

649
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:41,170
whether it's Sour Diesel whether it's OG

650
00:26:38,289 --> 00:26:42,609
or whether it's cookies if it's good if

651
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:44,259
it's grown properly you like your

652
00:26:42,609 --> 00:26:45,939
cannabis tapas a little bit of

653
00:26:44,259 --> 00:26:48,700
everything I do and I like having that

654
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:50,860
variety it's like over in Amsterdam when

655
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:53,080
I was over there last time we ended up

656
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:55,329
in Spain and I got some really good

657
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:56,799
gorilla glue and the gorilla goo was

658
00:26:55,329 --> 00:26:59,109
phenomenal where I wanted to smoke it in

659
00:26:56,799 --> 00:27:02,200
the morning and it was just such a

660
00:26:59,109 --> 00:27:04,149
strong smoke that I decided to switch

661
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:05,590
over to Liberty haze and herb walking to

662
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:07,809
the park we had an amazing time

663
00:27:05,589 --> 00:27:09,308
switching over and it's like the only

664
00:27:07,808 --> 00:27:13,210
difference is really the terpenes right

665
00:27:09,308 --> 00:27:15,879
but absolutely going back to haze

666
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:18,690
absolutely amazing but part of the

667
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:21,610
problem that they had was they basically

668
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:23,590
loved hay so much that was all they had

669
00:27:21,609 --> 00:27:25,119
over there for a long time - there was

670
00:27:23,589 --> 00:27:26,349
not a lot of diversity I mean I think

671
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:27,609
since he was bringing some stuff in

672
00:27:26,349 --> 00:27:30,189
there bringing some Durbin's and they're

673
00:27:27,609 --> 00:27:32,589
bringing some other unique things in but

674
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:35,350
people were like I want haze dr.

675
00:27:32,589 --> 00:27:39,579
Grinspoon 26 weeks okay well as you

676
00:27:35,349 --> 00:27:42,839
evaluate kind of Europe generically in

677
00:27:39,579 --> 00:27:45,970
the US right what trends are you seeing

678
00:27:42,839 --> 00:27:48,609
well I see things like history repeating

679
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:50,289
itself here well start with Europe

680
00:27:48,609 --> 00:27:53,229
because you're saying she's was there

681
00:27:50,289 --> 00:27:55,240
jamm what is there Jim now there Jim is

682
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:58,808
American strains they want so they wanna

683
00:27:55,240 --> 00:28:00,670
explore skittles okay they love skittles

684
00:27:58,808 --> 00:28:02,109
over there and you know how can you I

685
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:04,210
have skittles in my bag I got both

686
00:28:02,109 --> 00:28:05,769
extract and I got flour and I love

687
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:07,150
skittles skittles is any we grew it

688
00:28:05,769 --> 00:28:09,879
what's that who grew it

689
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:12,640
so the skittles that I have in my bag

690
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:15,280
was one of my my friends here in his

691
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:17,980
little little small growth but the

692
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:24,700
extract it came from a local place

693
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:27,549
around here maybe in Vegas yeah it's

694
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:30,840
it's some California stuff I got so but

695
00:28:27,549 --> 00:28:34,480
but it's like skittles skittles sherbert

696
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:36,189
people are wanting they want high trippy

697
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:40,029
and profiles and they want unique and

698
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:41,710
that's good yeah I think over in Europe

699
00:28:40,029 --> 00:28:43,629
and in the states we're looking for that

700
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:45,100
there's still a little bit behind us so

701
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:47,050
we kind of set the trend and then they

702
00:28:45,099 --> 00:28:47,740
try to scoop it up like the California

703
00:28:47,049 --> 00:28:51,308
more than any

704
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:53,470
it's a trip yeah I feel like what so so

705
00:28:51,308 --> 00:28:56,440
it's interested like I think of us

706
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:57,940
chocolate versus European chocolate yeah

707
00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:00,490
the Europeans are a little more

708
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:02,759
sophisticated and have what I consider a

709
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:09,120
better palate for things like chocolate

710
00:29:02,759 --> 00:29:12,129
with cannabis like I feel like here

711
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:14,409
everyone wanted the highest THC so like

712
00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:17,620
that there's the the appreciation of

713
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:19,960
sort of the full bouquet and body of

714
00:29:17,619 --> 00:29:22,299
what you're smoking like a wine or

715
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:24,730
whatever is I mean you do you appreciate

716
00:29:22,299 --> 00:29:26,589
it but your average person but did your

717
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:28,960
average European have a better

718
00:29:26,589 --> 00:29:32,230
appreciate like 5 10 20 years ago a

719
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:34,329
better appreciation for hash yeah that's

720
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:35,950
true perhaps you know they have our

721
00:29:34,329 --> 00:29:37,480
appreciation for hash on another level

722
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:40,960
we don't see that in the States we have

723
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:42,429
appreciation for extract but not like

724
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,079
that old school house and that

725
00:29:42,429 --> 00:29:46,720
old-school hash is kind of like smoking

726
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:48,039
a cigar it's got real nuances that if

727
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,089
you don't smoke ash all the time it all

728
00:29:48,039 --> 00:29:50,558
just tastes the same

729
00:29:49,089 --> 00:29:52,209
you know same thing with the cigar you

730
00:29:50,558 --> 00:29:54,190
don't smoke a cigar you pick one up it

731
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:56,140
just tastes like a fucking cigar but

732
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:57,460
back to the you know and it's funny

733
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:58,870
because I had a conversation with Lance

734
00:29:57,460 --> 00:30:02,170
I think a little bit about reference

735
00:29:58,869 --> 00:30:04,029
points you know going through life with

736
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:06,400
all the inbreeding I'm a chef as well

737
00:30:04,029 --> 00:30:08,289
and so the more things you taste the

738
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:11,730
more reference points you have the more

739
00:30:08,289 --> 00:30:14,230
you understand something and it's so

740
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:16,000
real interesting and I feel like I

741
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:19,960
breathe I try to breathe my reference

742
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:22,150
points I try to cook and understand

743
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:25,179
cultures by reference points than by

744
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:27,160
having a broad number of reference yeah

745
00:30:25,179 --> 00:30:30,009
and I'm constantly smelling jars so like

746
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:31,808
this I'm constantly smelling these

747
00:30:30,009 --> 00:30:33,819
flavor profiles to see kind of what

748
00:30:31,808 --> 00:30:36,399
would well would potentially go together

749
00:30:33,819 --> 00:30:38,049
you know and then you mix and match I do

750
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:39,940
some weird stuff we roll joints together

751
00:30:38,049 --> 00:30:42,639
of two strains and see if they taste

752
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:44,769
good as it looks

753
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:48,160
yeah a lot of those fun too and and

754
00:30:44,769 --> 00:30:50,910
sometimes one sometimes it's not so the

755
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:54,940
you're all right the Europeans are like

756
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:58,570
wanting an American sadly wanting

757
00:30:54,940 --> 00:31:01,039
American stuff the thing is is so you

758
00:30:58,569 --> 00:31:05,720
look at what it takes to Colton

759
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:08,539
and sell in Amsterdam compared to

760
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:10,220
California it's very difficult the

761
00:31:08,539 --> 00:31:12,349
systems that you like from a regulatory

762
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:14,960
standpoint yeah I mean from a regulatory

763
00:31:12,349 --> 00:31:16,849
standpoint just from a person wanting to

764
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:18,289
acquire good cannabis the process it

765
00:31:16,849 --> 00:31:19,879
goes through in California and the

766
00:31:18,289 --> 00:31:22,159
process it goes through to get it to

767
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:24,860
that same quality standard in Astra you

768
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:27,620
rarely see that a triple plus that you

769
00:31:24,859 --> 00:31:31,039
have in California in Amsterdam it's

770
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:35,059
it's rare but it's also humid and cold

771
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:37,220
and really really freakin cold and it's

772
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:39,679
also illegal to grow there so people are

773
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:40,880
basically you know they don't put people

774
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,720
in jail but there's take all your stuff

775
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,790
and they'll find you

776
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:45,529
so it's illegal to grow there whereas

777
00:31:43,789 --> 00:31:50,029
California people still have rooms in

778
00:31:45,529 --> 00:31:51,980
their houses and you know the standards

779
00:31:50,029 --> 00:31:53,809
are higher it's funny though that the

780
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:56,360
people that were growing that mediocre

781
00:31:53,809 --> 00:31:58,059
stuff five years ago that we're making

782
00:31:56,359 --> 00:32:03,319
money they're not making money anymore

783
00:31:58,059 --> 00:32:05,750
so so what about in the u.s. like are

784
00:32:03,319 --> 00:32:09,159
you seeing because one of the things for

785
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:11,539
example Kevin Jody talks about is like

786
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:14,450
you know different markets have

787
00:32:11,539 --> 00:32:17,389
different wants right like the East you

788
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:19,370
know I grew up selling in the East Coast

789
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:22,100
oh yeah so you grew up in Rhode Island

790
00:32:19,369 --> 00:32:25,219
right Austin Austin right I went to

791
00:32:22,099 --> 00:32:26,449
brown yeah so so you guys like Sour

792
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:28,970
Diesel and chem dawg

793
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:31,009
yeah pretty much exclusively like Sour

794
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:32,900
Diesel like me going to New York when I

795
00:32:31,009 --> 00:32:34,579
was younger it was like the Sour Diesel

796
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:36,440
was the best like people didn't give a

797
00:32:34,579 --> 00:32:39,710
shit about any OG nothing else our

798
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:42,230
Diesel was the one and you're paying 60

799
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:45,049
to 100 dollars an eighth straight up for

800
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:48,019
that stuff so what are you seeing so

801
00:32:45,049 --> 00:32:50,629
what do you seen either generically in

802
00:32:48,019 --> 00:32:53,539
the u.s. now so like where the trends

803
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:56,930
going so it used to be just like yeah it

804
00:32:53,539 --> 00:33:00,049
five years ago it was cookies oh gee

805
00:32:56,930 --> 00:33:02,720
basically Sour Diesel we had maybe some

806
00:33:00,049 --> 00:33:04,750
perps but it not specific right and that

807
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:08,870
was the black market the white market is

808
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:11,269
wedding cake lava cake birthday cake and

809
00:33:08,869 --> 00:33:13,729
all these trends right and the thing is

810
00:33:11,269 --> 00:33:14,788
is like we were breeding very stable

811
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:19,459
genetics

812
00:33:14,788 --> 00:33:21,778
you know before 2012 we focused on like

813
00:33:19,459 --> 00:33:24,570
stabilizing genetics releasing f4 is

814
00:33:21,778 --> 00:33:26,038
releasing f5 not releasing f2

815
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:28,678
like that was kind of against what we

816
00:33:26,038 --> 00:33:31,440
believed in at the time but nowadays

817
00:33:28,679 --> 00:33:32,699
people want F once and that's it and so

818
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:34,019
they want the latest and greatest in

819
00:33:32,699 --> 00:33:35,099

00:33:34,019 --> 00:33:36,618
something they kick that one of the

821
00:33:35,098 --> 00:33:39,779
curve and they like now I want this and

822
00:33:36,618 --> 00:33:52,169
it's because the white market

823
00:33:39,779 --> 00:33:52,170
