1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:12,709
[Music]

2
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:21,050
we're gonna dig into our panel now are

3
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:23,000
you ready are you ready for this yeah

4
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:25,460
all right I'm gonna go ahead and

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,469
introduce our panel we have james eikner

6
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:29,750
here from sauna packaging he's going to

7
00:00:27,469 --> 00:00:31,879
talk about hep based solutions for

8
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:34,369
packaging which is quite important we

9
00:00:31,879 --> 00:00:36,439
have our star Cristina Dempsey of the

10
00:00:34,369 --> 00:00:39,888
manufacturing cannabis safety branch

11
00:00:36,439 --> 00:00:41,599
this is the regulatory body from the

12
00:00:39,889 --> 00:00:44,629
Department of Health here in California

13
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:47,420
that regulates packaging Andrew Hopkins

14
00:00:44,628 --> 00:00:51,198
of the workshop and Julie Crockett of M

15
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:53,689
MLG consultancy here in Santa Monica so

16
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:55,608
let's start with you James can you talk

17
00:00:53,689 --> 00:00:57,649
to us a little bit about hemp based

18
00:00:55,609 --> 00:01:01,779
plastic and why it's a great alternative

19
00:00:57,649 --> 00:01:04,640
or could be for petroleum-based plastics

20
00:01:01,779 --> 00:01:06,439
so I'm with sauna packaging and we

21
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,358
design and develop hemp plastic

22
00:01:06,438 --> 00:01:12,679
packaging solutions for the cannabis

23
00:01:08,358 --> 00:01:15,099
industry simply put you can make plastic

24
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:17,179
out of a variety of bio-based materials

25
00:01:15,099 --> 00:01:20,750
hemp being one of them

26
00:01:17,179 --> 00:01:23,978
most bio plastic in the United States is

27
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:27,319
made out of corn and when we first

28
00:01:23,978 --> 00:01:29,688
started working on this we were

29
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:31,398
basically frustrated consumers looking

30
00:01:29,688 --> 00:01:32,989
at the amount of petroleum plastic

31
00:01:31,399 --> 00:01:36,549
packaging waste that we were creating

32
00:01:32,989 --> 00:01:39,949
and as we started to look into

33
00:01:36,549 --> 00:01:42,100
sustainable alternatives corn plastic

34
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:45,079
was the first thing we looked at but

35
00:01:42,099 --> 00:01:46,640
seeing the evolution of the hemp

36
00:01:45,078 --> 00:01:48,438
industry that's kind of been happening

37
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,659
in tandem with that at the cannabis

38
00:01:48,438 --> 00:01:53,839
industry we thought it would be a good

39
00:01:50,659 --> 00:01:55,850
idea to look into hemp based plastics

40
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:59,450
and that's kind of how we stumbled upon

41
00:01:55,849 --> 00:02:00,919
it a few years ago basically the the

42
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:04,939
plastic that we use to make our

43
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:08,420
packaging which is right here is a fiber

44
00:02:04,938 --> 00:02:12,889
reinforced biocomposite so we're using a

45
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:14,958
corn plastic resin which is a PLA as our

46
00:02:12,889 --> 00:02:15,439
base material and then we're infusing

47
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:17,240
that with

48
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:21,500
my critized tempered which is the

49
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:25,000
innards of the stock which is currently

50
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:28,449
very underutilized part of the plant and

51
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:32,120
it's a hundred percent plant-based and

52
00:02:28,449 --> 00:02:33,799
chemical free however I hope some of

53
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:35,539
what we'll get into this evening is

54
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:39,830
talking a little bit about waste

55
00:02:35,539 --> 00:02:43,459
recovery which is a large challenge for

56
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:46,190
all packaging for instance I believe

57
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:48,909
that only 40% of packaging is actually

58
00:02:46,189 --> 00:02:51,079
recovered where 60% is landfilled

59
00:02:48,909 --> 00:02:53,259
so recovery is a challenge for all

60
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:56,030
packaging materials but it's

61
00:02:53,259 --> 00:03:00,459
additionally complicated in the cannabis

62
00:02:56,030 --> 00:03:03,860
industry due to a number of factors the

63
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:05,870
largest of which is it'll be interesting

64
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:11,690
to see how it plays out in California

65
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:13,939
but for instance in Colorado even if the

66
00:03:11,689 --> 00:03:16,280
plastic that your cannabis packaging is

67
00:03:13,939 --> 00:03:18,560
made out of is recyclable recycling

68
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:23,000
facilities there do not accept cannabis

69
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:25,640
packaging so either a change needs to

70
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,699
happen where facilities can accept it or

71
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:31,359
there's a missing piece of the puzzle

72
00:03:27,699 --> 00:03:33,589
which would be you know a company that

73
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:37,160
sterilizes or cleans the packaging

74
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:39,950
before it goes to the facility so waste

75
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:42,469
recovery is a big challenge and you know

76
00:03:39,949 --> 00:03:45,859
regardless of how cool the materials are

77
00:03:42,469 --> 00:03:47,449
that we continue to develop that's

78
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:49,700
something that needs to be addressed

79
00:03:47,449 --> 00:03:52,939
before we can really solve the problem

80
00:03:49,699 --> 00:03:57,129
of waste within cannabis packaging and

81
00:03:52,939 --> 00:03:57,129
within sustainable packaging in general

82
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:03,709
can you speak to us about poison

83
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:06,110
prevention and what the what the testing

84
00:04:03,709 --> 00:04:08,360
is that's required to be considered

85
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:10,190
child resistant packaging because my

86
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:13,970
understanding is it does require quite a

87
00:04:10,189 --> 00:04:15,859
bit of testing and from my my research I

88
00:04:13,969 --> 00:04:18,079
believe that you can do your own testing

89
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:20,449
if you like but it's it's it's a

90
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,370
difficult endeavor and there are

91
00:04:20,449 --> 00:04:24,228
entities or agencies that will do that

92
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:29,269
for you I'd like to know a little bit

93
00:04:24,228 --> 00:04:32,839
more about that yeah so ASTM

94
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:35,689
the organization that kind of monitors

95
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:39,909
all of this however the testing can be

96
00:04:35,689 --> 00:04:44,480
done by a number of third-party testers

97
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:48,920
the poison Prevention Act I believe was

98
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:51,890
in 1970 I forget exactly what spawned it

99
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:56,810
but basically child resistant packaging

100
00:04:51,889 --> 00:04:59,120
was developed at that point and to stop

101
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:01,579
children under a certain age from be

102
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,899
able to access certain substances so it

103
00:05:01,579 --> 00:05:07,810
was pioneered in the pharmaceutical

104
00:05:02,899 --> 00:05:10,429
industry and now it affects cannabis and

105
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:13,459
as you would imagine

106
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:15,500
rather it's kind of exactly what you

107
00:05:13,459 --> 00:05:17,239
would imagine when you do the physical

108
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:21,709
testing whereas you actually get a room

109
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:24,189
full of you know 200 kids and under I

110
00:05:21,709 --> 00:05:27,289
believe it's 48 months or something and

111
00:05:24,189 --> 00:05:29,360
they have the way the testing actually

112
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:31,010
goes is they're giving they're given the

113
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,980
packaging samples they're given five

114
00:05:31,009 --> 00:05:35,779
minutes to try and open it and then

115
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:38,780
after those five minutes they're

116
00:05:35,779 --> 00:05:42,319
explained how to open it and then they

117
00:05:38,779 --> 00:05:45,579
have five additional minutes and you're

118
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:50,870
supposed to hit a threshold I believe of

119
00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:54,199
over eighty percent so if more than 20%

120
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:56,420
of the samples are open then you fail

121
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:58,810
the testing and that's kind of as as

122
00:05:56,420 --> 00:06:01,370
simply as I can put it but it is kind of

123
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:06,230
funny being there and watching all these

124
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:08,990
kids try and open packaging there are

125
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:11,509
allowances for elderly packaging in

126
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:12,769
other industries and unfortunately

127
00:06:11,509 --> 00:06:15,920
that's not something that's been made

128
00:06:12,769 --> 00:06:18,500
available to us potentially you can talk

129
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:21,050
to us about why that is that the the

130
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:28,610
elderly rosalie allowance was not part

131
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:29,629
of our regulatory basis sure so again my

132
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:31,910
name is Kristy and I'm the outreach

133
00:06:29,629 --> 00:06:33,889
manager for the California Department of

134
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:35,720
Public Health's manufactured cannabis

135
00:06:33,889 --> 00:06:39,589
safety branch was which is a whole lot

136
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:42,849
of words before I answer your question

137
00:06:39,589 --> 00:06:45,478
I'll just tell you my area of specialty

138
00:06:42,848 --> 00:06:47,498
is cannabis manufacturing and

139
00:06:45,478 --> 00:06:49,899
manufactured products so if there's a

140
00:06:47,499 --> 00:06:51,669
question that is asked in the audience

141
00:06:49,899 --> 00:06:55,718
or by Courtney

142
00:06:51,668 --> 00:06:57,908
that is falls under another state office

143
00:06:55,718 --> 00:07:00,189
I'll tell you which state office it is

144
00:06:57,908 --> 00:07:02,978
but I can't answer those questions so

145
00:07:00,189 --> 00:07:05,259
I'll try to be as clear as I can for

146
00:07:02,978 --> 00:07:06,908
answers that fall under our office and

147
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:09,699
I'll tell you where they fall if they

148
00:07:06,908 --> 00:07:13,088
don't so to answer your question about

149
00:07:09,699 --> 00:07:15,309
the elderly packaging allowances the

150
00:07:13,088 --> 00:07:17,829
medicinal and adult use cannabis

151
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:20,709
regulation and Safety Act or mal curse'

152
00:07:17,829 --> 00:07:22,748
which created the whole cannabis

153
00:07:20,709 --> 00:07:25,990
regulatory structure for both adult use

154
00:07:22,749 --> 00:07:28,269
and medicinal cannabis specifically

155
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:31,629
states child resistant packaging it

156
00:07:28,269 --> 00:07:34,179
doesn't refer to the poison prevention

157
00:07:31,629 --> 00:07:36,278
packaging act that's what our office did

158
00:07:34,178 --> 00:07:39,818
in talking about what would qualify as

159
00:07:36,278 --> 00:07:43,028
child resistant packaging but because

160
00:07:39,819 --> 00:07:44,830
the act itself refers to all cannabis

161
00:07:43,028 --> 00:07:46,569
and cannabis products being in child

162
00:07:44,829 --> 00:07:48,818
resistant packaging we didn't have any

163
00:07:46,569 --> 00:07:50,800
req regulatory authority to allow for

164
00:07:48,819 --> 00:07:52,449
something like that it's worth noting

165
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,519
that with the elderly allowance you

166
00:07:52,449 --> 00:07:57,218
would be able to say on the package this

167
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:59,439
is for households with no children in

168
00:07:57,218 --> 00:08:01,748
which instance you would not need the

169
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:03,218
child resistant packaging so that would

170
00:08:01,749 --> 00:08:05,860
be pretty nice for us it would also

171
00:08:03,218 --> 00:08:07,418
reduce them out of plastic because in

172
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,860
many of the solutions some of the

173
00:08:07,418 --> 00:08:11,168
solutions I passed around here today

174
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:13,088
you'll see that plastic is providing a

175
00:08:11,168 --> 00:08:15,278
solution with the child-resistant cap

176
00:08:13,088 --> 00:08:18,399
for example so potentially we can get

177
00:08:15,278 --> 00:08:20,408
around that another issue that I see is

178
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:24,038
that with pharmaceutical industry for

179
00:08:20,408 --> 00:08:26,199
example they can do shipments of bulk

180
00:08:24,038 --> 00:08:27,968
products so the pharmacy isn't getting

181
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:29,439
tiny bottles of child resistant

182
00:08:27,968 --> 00:08:31,360
packaging they're getting a bulk

183
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:33,879
shipment and then they are packaging at

184
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,589
the retail level and in our industry

185
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:37,750
unfortunately we're not packaging at the

186
00:08:35,589 --> 00:08:40,509
retail level and there's no bulk

187
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:42,519
packaging available to us is that

188
00:08:40,509 --> 00:08:44,110
something that we can also ask you about

189
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:50,139
Christina about what may be the

190
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:52,060
reasoning was for that or okay we're

191
00:08:50,139 --> 00:08:54,909
gonna talk to the bureau later

192
00:08:52,059 --> 00:08:57,309
all right let's let's turn to you guys

193
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:59,889
Andrew and Julie I know that you have

194
00:08:57,309 --> 00:09:01,809
different specialties but can we ask you

195
00:08:59,889 --> 00:09:03,939
about some of the issues you've seen

196
00:09:01,809 --> 00:09:06,609
with your clients that we didn't talk

197
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:08,860
about and potentially individuals in our

198
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:11,800
audience have had similar issues my name

199
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:14,589
is Julie Crockett I'm a director of

200
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:16,778
compliance for M MLG I was recruited to

201
00:09:14,589 --> 00:09:21,970
help launch a brand called W vapes a

202
00:09:16,778 --> 00:09:23,620
vaporizer brand in 2015 I very I mean I

203
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:25,960
had no experience in the cannabis

204
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:27,399
industry my previous job I was a

205
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:29,800
marketing director for an adult toy

206
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:35,889
company so that was my background with

207
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:38,588
dealing in fringe industries and I you

208
00:09:35,889 --> 00:09:40,899
know walked into as a civilian in Los

209
00:09:38,589 --> 00:09:43,510
Angeles I thought in knowing nothing

210
00:09:40,899 --> 00:09:44,709
about cannabis law I was like there's

211
00:09:43,509 --> 00:09:46,689
dispensaries everywhere it's been

212
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:49,810
illegal for years it's no big deal and

213
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:51,400
then I realized I walked into an empty

214
00:09:49,809 --> 00:09:52,989
warehouse an empty office building in an

215
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:54,959
extraction laboratory and was like

216
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:58,779
what's up guys what are you doing and

217
00:09:54,960 --> 00:10:00,790
and and realized that I was put in

218
00:09:58,779 --> 00:10:04,899
charge of an unlicensed business in Los

219
00:10:00,789 --> 00:10:06,909
Angeles and very quickly made myself

220
00:10:04,899 --> 00:10:09,069
their chief compliance officer and

221
00:10:06,909 --> 00:10:11,169
helped guide that company towards

222
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:13,810
compliance and did that for three years

223
00:10:11,169 --> 00:10:15,909
and then ended up doing a flip where I

224
00:10:13,809 --> 00:10:21,039
went to work with our compliance

225
00:10:15,909 --> 00:10:22,600
attorney at MLG and and now my my old

226
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:24,309
job became a client and now I get to

227
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:29,019
help a bunch more people go through this

228
00:10:24,309 --> 00:10:31,689
process so as a person what I do with

229
00:10:29,019 --> 00:10:33,429
them MLG is I am the do ongoing

230
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:35,440
compliance with all kinds of different

231
00:10:33,429 --> 00:10:38,708
operators so I work with cultivators and

232
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:41,500
manufacturers and retailers pretty much

233
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:44,049
every license type and and go in and

234
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:45,879
help them to figure out how to navigate

235
00:10:44,049 --> 00:10:50,740
and meet the requirements of these

236
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:55,120
regulations which is brutal enough like

237
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:58,480
the experience the real-world experience

238
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:01,690
of operators trying to adjust their

239
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:03,899
businesses and continually pivot to the

240
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:08,330
demands of these regulations

241
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:13,319
is heartbreaking and crucifying to watch

242
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:15,300
the the costs of compliance the costs of

243
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:18,300
lawyers and consultants and redesigning

244
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:20,549
your packaging and and the impossibility

245
00:11:18,299 --> 00:11:23,789
of competing with an illicit market at

246
00:11:20,549 --> 00:11:26,939
this moment is crushing the most

247
00:11:23,789 --> 00:11:31,259
compliant companies that I work with are

248
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:33,450
doing the worst our suffering are losing

249
00:11:31,259 --> 00:11:36,360
money their sales are down 60 to 90

250
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:41,040
percent they cannot sustain and compete

251
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:45,960
in this environment that said you know I

252
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:48,809
help them try to find a way so so some

253
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:51,900
of it is understanding like that this

254
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:54,389
you know this is an evolving system the

255
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:57,629
one thing that gives me hope as we go

256
00:11:54,389 --> 00:12:00,299
through this process is one cannabis

257
00:11:57,629 --> 00:12:03,419
folks are wily and creative and they

258
00:12:00,299 --> 00:12:07,409
will find a way so that's a good part

259
00:12:03,419 --> 00:12:11,219
and to that this is a living evolving

260
00:12:07,409 --> 00:12:13,980
process that is still happening that

261
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:16,170
there is like the the political

262
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:18,420
activation that has happened for me as

263
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:21,389
an individual by going through this

264
00:12:18,419 --> 00:12:23,939
process by working at the state level

265
00:12:21,389 --> 00:12:25,710
with organizations like CCI a and the

266
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:29,300
trade organizations with local

267
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:33,570
organizations like glocca like go seeing

268
00:12:29,299 --> 00:12:36,899
human beings inform policy and watch

269
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:38,580
laws change I saw a law change sitting

270
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:41,399
in a meeting with the Department of

271
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:43,590
Public Health because what it was

272
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:45,990
written is not what they meant and when

273
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:47,850
somebody from the industry explained to

274
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:49,860
them do you realize what the impact of

275
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:51,990
this law is gonna do to businesses they

276
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:54,360
went oh no that's not what we meant

277
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:57,629
let's change that so we're actually in

278
00:12:54,360 --> 00:13:00,389
this incredible moment of time where the

279
00:12:57,629 --> 00:13:02,519
agencies the state agencies know that

280
00:13:00,389 --> 00:13:05,189
they don't know everything and are

281
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:08,279
listening and willing to receive input

282
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:10,680
and they have to hear a voice that's

283
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:13,019
loud enough and clear enough and can

284
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:15,620
tell a concise enough story because

285
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:17,058
attention spans and time is short to

286
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:19,278
communicate

287
00:13:17,058 --> 00:13:20,838
like the real needs of this industry

288
00:13:19,278 --> 00:13:22,639
because it's a very short window that we

289
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:26,959
have right now really short window and

290
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:28,788
when this period comes up of the the

291
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:32,178
full regulatory language being

292
00:13:28,788 --> 00:13:34,938
introduced in operators have 45 days to

293
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:38,208
make a comment on it which the agencies

294
00:13:34,938 --> 00:13:40,218
have to respond to every single comment

295
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:42,168
that is submitted during that time there

296
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:43,909
has never been a better time to tell

297
00:13:42,168 --> 00:13:45,528
your story and state your experience and

298
00:13:43,908 --> 00:13:48,468
talk about what needs to be done and

299
00:13:45,528 --> 00:13:50,479
what's not working and and not receive

300
00:13:48,469 --> 00:13:52,519
this is something that's just happening

301
00:13:50,479 --> 00:13:54,439
to you but it's something that's

302
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:57,048
actually being participated in because

303
00:13:54,438 --> 00:14:00,408
for years I've been saying in these next

304
00:13:57,048 --> 00:14:03,889
like you know few months we're either

305
00:14:00,408 --> 00:14:05,989
going to see the cannabis industry wake

306
00:14:03,889 --> 00:14:08,298
up come together and become one of the

307
00:14:05,989 --> 00:14:10,609
biggest like political forces the world

308
00:14:08,298 --> 00:14:13,428
has ever seen to defend what has been

309
00:14:10,609 --> 00:14:15,889
built or see it get ripped out of our

310
00:14:13,428 --> 00:14:17,778
hands and become an industry like every

311
00:14:15,889 --> 00:14:22,178
other industry and Amazon will be like

312
00:14:17,778 --> 00:14:22,178
delivering vapes it'll be it'll suck so

313
00:14:22,298 --> 00:14:31,068
basically that's what I do I want to add

314
00:14:28,068 --> 00:14:32,598
to that I worked with a global cannabis

315
00:14:31,068 --> 00:14:34,908
manufacturer and I worked so hard

316
00:14:32,599 --> 00:14:38,329
through the winter holidays to bring

317
00:14:34,908 --> 00:14:40,759
medicine to patients and then in January

318
00:14:38,328 --> 00:14:44,418
discovered that there was 800 dollar fee

319
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:46,399
per unit for for the testing so when

320
00:14:44,418 --> 00:14:48,739
we're larger companies and we're going

321
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:51,918
to market and we're bringing large

322
00:14:48,739 --> 00:14:53,989
volumes of product it can make sense you

323
00:14:51,918 --> 00:14:55,759
kind of work it out in terms of the

324
00:14:53,989 --> 00:14:57,829
volume but if you have smaller volumes

325
00:14:55,759 --> 00:15:00,199
of product and you didn't know it's a

326
00:14:57,828 --> 00:15:02,269
huge it's a huge expense especially if

327
00:15:00,198 --> 00:15:04,608
you have multiple SCU's because of the

328
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:06,619
testing is per stew that means you have

329
00:15:04,609 --> 00:15:09,969
a different size product it's each size

330
00:15:06,619 --> 00:15:14,288
so that's something worth noting

331
00:15:09,969 --> 00:15:14,289
first of all tough act to follow

332
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:19,560
my name is Andrew Hopkins I work for the

333
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:21,329
workshop we are a laboratory front

334
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:24,000
pioneering some terpene development and

335
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:25,370
flavors in addition we do compliance

336
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,230
consulting up and down the entire

337
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:30,690
cannabis supply chain myself personally

338
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:32,759
I work a lot with the manufacturing side

339
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:34,220
of things so to answer the original

340
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:37,019
question what are some of the challenges

341
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:40,110
the workshop has observed with brands

342
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:42,000
and specific to packaging the biggest

343
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:45,120
challenge we're facing right now is with

344
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,529
the idea of preprinting potency as

345
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:49,379
Courtney mentioned before the only

346
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:52,709
requirements to list on your label are

347
00:15:49,379 --> 00:15:55,950
THC and CBD that's it you have a plus or

348
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:56,580
minus 10% variance on that those listed

349
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:58,320
cannabinoids

350
00:15:56,580 --> 00:16:00,570
now there's two caveats I want to

351
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,700
mention to this as Courtney mentioned if

352
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:05,340
you start to list other cannabinoids THC

353
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:08,460
a CBD a any of the others the same rules

354
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:10,139
apply 10% plus or minus and generally

355
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:12,509
speaking those cannabinoids are found at

356
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:15,299
much lower levels in your packaging the

357
00:16:12,509 --> 00:16:17,399
same it applied to CBD traditional vape

358
00:16:15,299 --> 00:16:19,109
cartridges let's just assume it's 700

359
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:21,449
milligrams it might that gives you

360
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:23,310
basically 70 milligrams plus or minus of

361
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:25,290
your variance on your testing so you

362
00:16:23,309 --> 00:16:28,709
have some wiggle room based on the BCC

363
00:16:25,289 --> 00:16:30,449
regulations however CBD if you only have

364
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:32,850
one milligram in your product you have

365
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:34,890
10% that gives you almost no wiggle room

366
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:38,730
in the BCC state testing laboratory

367
00:16:34,889 --> 00:16:41,279
requirements so what we recommend and

368
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:43,409
although brands generally do not like it

369
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:44,909
we recommend do not drink your potency

370
00:16:43,409 --> 00:16:47,339
on your permanent packaging

371
00:16:44,909 --> 00:16:48,929
apply some sort of sticker that you do

372
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:50,610
at the time of production because that

373
00:16:48,929 --> 00:16:52,199
way you do your final potency testing

374
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:53,930
and you'll know that hey it's going to

375
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,920
be within that 10% threshold

376
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:57,689
unfortunately if you go off and do a

377
00:16:55,919 --> 00:16:59,699
5,000 print run and preprint your

378
00:16:57,690 --> 00:17:01,680
potency due to manufacturing

379
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:03,210
complications we know that that potency

380
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:05,220
can change and now you're in a position

381
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:06,809
where they're stuck with packaging you

382
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:08,459
can't use or you're going to have to

383
00:17:06,809 --> 00:17:10,349
either label over it or sticker over it

384
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:12,630
in some way shape or form to make it

385
00:17:10,349 --> 00:17:15,569
compliant and so although it's not

386
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:18,000
aesthetically pleasing keep this in mind

387
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:19,470
as you go to your manufacturers that if

388
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,088
you want to pre print your potency you

389
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:22,078
better be darn sure you can not get

390
00:17:21,088 --> 00:17:23,638
block down that number

391
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:25,499
because if you can't your boxes are

392
00:17:23,638 --> 00:17:28,498
gonna look even worse with markers all

393
00:17:25,499 --> 00:17:29,850
over and stickers the Henry's package

394
00:17:28,499 --> 00:17:32,548
that I passed around has what is called

395
00:17:29,849 --> 00:17:35,069
the variable data label and you'll see

396
00:17:32,548 --> 00:17:37,288
on there that that's a solution for this

397
00:17:35,069 --> 00:17:39,118
problem that you're printing a variable

398
00:17:37,288 --> 00:17:41,278
label instead of printing the boxes

399
00:17:39,118 --> 00:17:43,678
themselves so that you don't have issues

400
00:17:41,278 --> 00:17:45,659
when you're trying to meet this variance

401
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,220
of five milligrams which is quite

402
00:17:45,659 --> 00:17:50,999
difficult when you work out the ratio

403
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:53,159
and the numbers so can we talk to you

404
00:17:50,999 --> 00:17:56,519
Christina about some of the issues

405
00:17:53,159 --> 00:17:58,859
facing the department Public Health I

406
00:17:56,519 --> 00:18:00,628
think I want to just piggyback on

407
00:17:58,858 --> 00:18:02,908
Julie's statement that the regulatory

408
00:18:00,628 --> 00:18:04,709
bodies do care about what we have to say

409
00:18:02,909 --> 00:18:09,269
as an industry that's another reason

410
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:11,190
we're here today we are here yes exactly

411
00:18:09,269 --> 00:18:13,409
as I was getting into that yes they are

412
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:15,629
very responsive we reached out to them

413
00:18:13,409 --> 00:18:17,730
and said would you please send a member

414
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:19,048
of your organization and she really

415
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:20,460
rallied for us to make sure that she

416
00:18:19,048 --> 00:18:22,888
could be here so thank you for that

417
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:24,869
again maybe you can talk to us about

418
00:18:22,888 --> 00:18:27,599
what are the issues for Public Health

419
00:18:24,868 --> 00:18:30,749
that are at the top of your list that we

420
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:32,519
need to to discuss I know that brass

421
00:18:30,749 --> 00:18:34,499
knuckles for example not to call them

422
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:37,308
out but we're gonna start to see some

423
00:18:34,499 --> 00:18:42,089
more litigation and pertaining to

424
00:18:37,308 --> 00:18:44,668
pesticides pesticides are a dire a dire

425
00:18:42,089 --> 00:18:46,528
issue for our planet they're much more

426
00:18:44,669 --> 00:18:50,399
prevalent now than they were 20 years

427
00:18:46,528 --> 00:18:53,368
ago and if you are an organic cultivator

428
00:18:50,398 --> 00:18:56,518
for example I'm using organic in the

429
00:18:53,368 --> 00:18:59,158
sense that you are cultivating without

430
00:18:56,519 --> 00:19:02,069
pesticides if you are cultivating

431
00:18:59,159 --> 00:19:04,799
organically you can be subject to what

432
00:19:02,069 --> 00:19:06,089
we call pesticide drift so other farms

433
00:19:04,798 --> 00:19:09,210
are using pesticides and now it

434
00:19:06,089 --> 00:19:10,798
compromises your cultivation so it's

435
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:13,108
something that's pretty serious and we

436
00:19:10,798 --> 00:19:14,638
want to we want to we want to keep an

437
00:19:13,108 --> 00:19:16,878
eye on that because it affects our

438
00:19:14,638 --> 00:19:19,439
children we're finding that there are

439
00:19:16,878 --> 00:19:22,048
residues of pesticides in the umbilical

440
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,850
cord it's causing brain damage this is a

441
00:19:22,048 --> 00:19:25,618
real issue and it's here today so just

442
00:19:23,849 --> 00:19:29,038
for example though I'll let you take it

443
00:19:25,618 --> 00:19:30,439
from here okay that was a lot of

444
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:32,740
different things but I'll give you some

445
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:37,660
public health issues that we're

446
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:40,450
are looking at because testing happens

447
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:42,759
in the final stage right before product

448
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:46,120
goes to retail which is different from

449
00:19:42,759 --> 00:19:49,779
some of the other states I think a lot

450
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:52,569
of the contaminated product issues that

451
00:19:49,779 --> 00:19:55,779
other states have seen will not happen

452
00:19:52,569 --> 00:19:58,000
in the same volume in California so as

453
00:19:55,779 --> 00:20:01,000
many headaches as the testing system

454
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,890
does create I think there's some public

455
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:07,450
health benefit to the way that it's set

456
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:10,090
up from one of the things that we've

457
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:12,700
been looking at is how manufacturing

458
00:20:10,089 --> 00:20:16,329
facilities are set up so we have quite a

459
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:20,410
number of extractors among our

460
00:20:16,329 --> 00:20:21,549
manufacturer population and one of the

461
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:25,210
things that our inspectors are looking

462
00:20:21,549 --> 00:20:28,149
at is do you know how to operate the

463
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:32,650
equipment that you have which shouldn't

464
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:34,509
be a tough question but it is with

465
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:36,790
people coming into this market we've

466
00:20:34,509 --> 00:20:38,410
seen people who order equipment and they

467
00:20:36,789 --> 00:20:40,359
read the instructions and they think oh

468
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:42,519
I know how to operate this and the

469
00:20:40,359 --> 00:20:45,939
reality is extraction is a chemical

470
00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:48,759
process in a lot of instances and you

471
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:52,480
have to understand chemistry or at least

472
00:20:48,759 --> 00:20:54,099
basic science so one of the things our

473
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,140
inspectors have been asking when they go

474
00:20:54,099 --> 00:20:58,089
into facilities is tell me how this

475
00:20:56,140 --> 00:21:01,030
equipment works how do you disassemble

476
00:20:58,089 --> 00:21:02,649
it to clean it some basic questions

477
00:21:01,029 --> 00:21:05,230
about it

478
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:07,769
so we've been looking at is it being

479
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:11,620
operated safely as it's set up safely

480
00:21:07,769 --> 00:21:14,200
are there any risks to the workforce and

481
00:21:11,619 --> 00:21:16,629
the surrounding communities

482
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:20,110
so that's products that's manufacturing

483
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:23,559
I don't know any other public health

484
00:21:20,109 --> 00:21:25,539
issues that are on your mind I think it

485
00:21:23,558 --> 00:21:29,190
might it might do some justice to share

486
00:21:25,539 --> 00:21:32,440
the fact that much of the regulatory

487
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:35,230
outline is based on historical context

488
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:39,130
so for example I don't know if you all

489
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:40,890
remember the tylenol murders of 1982 but

490
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:44,320
this is where this tamper-evident

491
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:46,150
packaging stems from individuals went to

492
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:47,529
the store they purchased tylenol

493
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:49,420
they took it for a headache and then

494
00:21:47,529 --> 00:21:51,940
unfortunately that was their demise

495
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:54,460
because it was poisoned and in that day

496
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:56,350
I think you know as a as a populace we

497
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:58,029
were much more trusting so there wasn't

498
00:21:56,349 --> 00:22:00,309
a concern about whether or not someone

499
00:21:58,029 --> 00:22:02,230
had tampered with your product of course

500
00:22:00,309 --> 00:22:03,669
now I think we've we've come to a point

501
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:07,269
where maybe it's a little excessive

502
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:09,850
however there are solutions we spoke

503
00:22:07,269 --> 00:22:12,879
about whether or not you can use a paper

504
00:22:09,849 --> 00:22:14,799
strip around your package to indicate

505
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:18,820
whether it's been tampered with and the

506
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:20,259
answer was yes also if you would like to

507
00:22:18,819 --> 00:22:23,230
go a little bit step another step

508
00:22:20,259 --> 00:22:24,940
further you can put your logo and print

509
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:27,579
that on the packaging so it's not just

510
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:29,529
an Avery label that anybody can pick up

511
00:22:27,579 --> 00:22:31,149
and put on top of a package it's a

512
00:22:29,529 --> 00:22:33,069
little bit more unique and descriptive

513
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:34,390
it's another branding component so

514
00:22:33,069 --> 00:22:36,639
that's something that you can leverage

515
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:39,250
you can also put on your packaging a

516
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:41,290
little note to indicate that hey by the

517
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:44,049
way there was a tamper-evident strip

518
00:22:41,289 --> 00:22:46,659
here if it's not here now then you

519
00:22:44,049 --> 00:22:51,159
should be cautious and in taking this

520
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:52,210
product I'll add one thing to the public

521
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,980
health side because I like that you

522
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:55,660
brought up packaging and labeling our

523
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:58,660
labeling requirements are fairly

524
00:22:55,660 --> 00:23:00,850
extensive and there's a reason for that

525
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:01,840
we really want consumers to be informed

526
00:23:00,849 --> 00:23:04,359
about the products that they're

527
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:07,230
consuming so it comes from a real place

528
00:23:04,359 --> 00:23:09,639
the tamper evident that's part of MRSA

529
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:11,079
but I think there's real value to

530
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:14,440
knowing when these products have been

531
00:23:11,079 --> 00:23:17,500
opened before and then the

532
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:21,309
child-resistant piece is comes from mal

533
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:23,049
Karsa because mal cursus says that one

534
00:23:21,309 --> 00:23:25,659
of the cornerstones of all of our

535
00:23:23,049 --> 00:23:28,240
regulations that we develop but the law

536
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:30,940
in general is protection of Public

537
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:33,000
Health and use in particular

538
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:35,620
so the child-resistant packaging

539
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:38,980
requirements while they can feel like a

540
00:23:35,619 --> 00:23:42,479
lot to grapple with as a business the

541
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:44,890
legislature was really keeping the

542
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:50,769
residents of the state of California in

543
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:53,380
mind for that I visited Oregon a few

544
00:23:50,769 --> 00:23:57,279
years ago and I took the opportunity to

545
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:58,530
go to a retail out a dispensary and when

546
00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:01,529
I went in they had

547
00:23:58,529 --> 00:24:03,509
a exit package so when you go there you

548
00:24:01,529 --> 00:24:05,399
can purchase an exit package II I don't

549
00:24:03,509 --> 00:24:08,400
say if that's the case now but at the

550
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:10,170
time okay thank you when you go in you

551
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:12,570
can purchase an exit package it's child

552
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:14,789
resistant and it creates a solution for

553
00:24:12,569 --> 00:24:17,189
all of your packaging needs so we don't

554
00:24:14,789 --> 00:24:19,289
have an instance where we're trying to

555
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:22,200
package a pre-roll for example to be

556
00:24:19,289 --> 00:24:24,809
child resistant sana James brought a

557
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:26,670
very nice example of a solution here

558
00:24:24,809 --> 00:24:28,740
it's similar to a Tylenol bottle when

559
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:31,500
you turn the cap and you align the notch

560
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:33,299
and then you can open it so we're

561
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:36,269
creating these solutions to to meet the

562
00:24:33,299 --> 00:24:39,029
demands but there there are solutions

563
00:24:36,269 --> 00:24:41,369
that other markets have presented Oregon

564
00:24:39,029 --> 00:24:43,889
being one if you don't if you don't

565
00:24:41,369 --> 00:24:45,839
purchase this exit package that's child

566
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:47,550
resistant you can bring your own so

567
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:49,949
similar to what we have here in

568
00:24:47,549 --> 00:24:51,509
California the ten cent bag requirement

569
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:53,460
if you bring your own package we're

570
00:24:51,509 --> 00:24:55,049
reducing waste where we're using and

571
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:57,059
that's something that we could be doing

572
00:24:55,049 --> 00:24:59,669
here in California as well we could be a

573
00:24:57,059 --> 00:25:00,750
model for the entire nation of course

574
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:03,690
Oregon's already done it

575
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:05,490
so here's a question if if I may is it

576
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:07,830
possible for you to elaborate on

577
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:12,329
potentially why we didn't choose that as

578
00:25:07,829 --> 00:25:14,699
a solution for California it's the way

579
00:25:12,329 --> 00:25:16,799
that Marisa was worded and I don't know

580
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:18,720
if it was intentionally or not but the

581
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:21,299
way mousekersize worded is is that that

582
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:24,269
child resistant packaging piece must be

583
00:25:21,299 --> 00:25:25,589
done before retail sale so our

584
00:25:24,269 --> 00:25:27,930
interpretation or the bureau's

585
00:25:25,589 --> 00:25:30,179
interpretation is that that means before

586
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:34,080
the time of sale so you're talking about

587
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:37,710
on the product quite a few other states

588
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:40,649
have used exit packaging that is child

589
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:43,559
resistant to do that same function to

590
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:45,690
protect consumers I I think it's a

591
00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:47,220
possibility here but our position is

592
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:49,350
that it would require a legislative

593
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:55,829
change to be able to allow us to change

594
00:25:49,349 --> 00:25:58,649
that in regulations I just want to add

595
00:25:55,829 --> 00:26:03,359
to that I think one of the issues with

596
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:07,470
the exit bag conundrum is that it causes

597
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:09,509
redundant packaging and if you have a

598
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:10,970
legislative environment where you're

599
00:26:09,509 --> 00:26:13,808
trying to

600
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:16,339
everyone comply to certain regulations

601
00:26:13,808 --> 00:26:19,149
to have the wiggle room of being able to

602
00:26:16,339 --> 00:26:22,149
use an exit bag just causes people to

603
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:25,580
not necessarily meet the regulations

604
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:27,590
because they can fall back on a retail

605
00:26:25,579 --> 00:26:29,418
outlet having to use an exit bag and

606
00:26:27,589 --> 00:26:31,279
that costs retail outlet and it also

607
00:26:29,419 --> 00:26:33,860
these exit bags are typically made out

608
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:37,490
of mylar which are very terrible for the

609
00:26:33,859 --> 00:26:41,298
environment and then even if you do have

610
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:43,880
someone for instance in Oregon it's

611
00:26:41,298 --> 00:26:46,220
about 50/50 there whether the actual

612
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:48,200
package that the product and is child

613
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:50,509
resistant and even if it is child

614
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:51,950
resistant the dispensaries they're just

615
00:26:50,509 --> 00:26:55,879
trying to cover their asses so they'll

616
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:57,679
still throw it in a mylar exit bag and

617
00:26:55,880 --> 00:27:00,530
so then you have a child resistant

618
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:02,570
packaging package and I just think it

619
00:27:00,529 --> 00:27:06,529
opens kind of a Pandora's box for

620
00:27:02,569 --> 00:27:09,918
inefficiency which leads me to my lower

621
00:27:06,529 --> 00:27:13,519
packaging so in case you all are not

622
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:16,850
aware mylar is a metallus eyes plastic

623
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:19,519
and there are only three recycling

624
00:27:16,849 --> 00:27:21,769
facilities in the entire country it's

625
00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:24,288
also one of the most prevalent used

626
00:27:21,769 --> 00:27:27,980
prevalent used packaging for cannabis

627
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:29,679
that we see so be aware that those

628
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:31,759
facilities are here in California

629
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:34,419
potentially we should be leveraging them

630
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:37,579
but if I may I would ask you to consider

631
00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:39,409
glass or some other renewable resource

632
00:27:37,579 --> 00:27:41,629
in your solutions

633
00:27:39,409 --> 00:27:45,020
I spoke to James and I said hey are you

634
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:48,530
guys gonna do a hemp hemp based solution

635
00:27:45,019 --> 00:27:50,720
for a CRP cap similar to what we talked

636
00:27:48,529 --> 00:27:52,369
about earlier and they said it's on

637
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,870
their agenda you know they've done a

638
00:27:52,369 --> 00:27:55,489
great service and in trying to bring

639
00:27:53,869 --> 00:27:57,500
these products to market and these

640
00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:59,329
solutions given that there is this

641
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:02,150
excessive testing that has to happen for

642
00:27:59,329 --> 00:28:05,149
example there's a cost associated and

643
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:09,320
I'd like to maybe can we talk a little

644
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:13,700
bit more on about the the hemp solution

645
00:28:09,319 --> 00:28:15,859
and how it affects the the landfills in

646
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:22,090
terms of the way that methane gas is

647
00:28:15,859 --> 00:28:25,990
released etc yeah absolutely so

648
00:28:22,089 --> 00:28:29,359
I'm plastic similar to corn plastic is

649
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:31,990
biodegradable however that is not to be

650
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:34,129
confused with compostable so

651
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:36,140
biodegradable just means that something

652
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:38,540
will break down in a reasonable amount

653
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:40,610
of time and it's literally defined as a

654
00:28:38,539 --> 00:28:43,548
reasonable amount of time so that's up

655
00:28:40,609 --> 00:28:46,250
for debate what reasonable is with

656
00:28:43,548 --> 00:28:50,359
exposure to light water and oxygen

657
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:52,519
similarly compostable products are

658
00:28:50,359 --> 00:28:54,798
defined that way but the reasonable

659
00:28:52,519 --> 00:29:00,109
amount of time is 180 days within

660
00:28:54,798 --> 00:29:02,319
certain conditions and where am I going

661
00:29:00,109 --> 00:29:02,319
with this

662
00:29:05,109 --> 00:29:11,479
methane gas exactly so what are the

663
00:29:07,849 --> 00:29:14,569
benefits of hemp plastic is if your

664
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:17,120
product does end up in a landfill the

665
00:29:14,569 --> 00:29:20,289
hemp will act as a carbon trap and it'll

666
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:23,418
trap that carbon so it won't release gas

667
00:29:20,289 --> 00:29:25,700
however if it does go to an appropriate

668
00:29:23,419 --> 00:29:28,009
composting facility it can also be

669
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:31,220
appropriately composted so it kind of

670
00:29:28,009 --> 00:29:33,410
offers a dual solution and in the short

671
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:35,630
term we're gonna be looking at most hemp

672
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:38,150
plastic going to landfills simply

673
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:40,640
because waste recovery is a huge issue

674
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:44,298
and it's not just with hemp plastic even

675
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:46,840
with you know your to go Starbucks cups

676
00:29:44,298 --> 00:29:49,789
that are made out of corn plastic about

677
00:29:46,839 --> 00:29:53,990
5% of composting facilities nationwide

678
00:29:49,789 --> 00:29:56,089
even accept that so it you know green

679
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:59,419
washing is the wrong term for it it's

680
00:29:56,089 --> 00:30:02,990
more just an issue of consumer education

681
00:29:59,419 --> 00:30:04,400
and consumer engagement and you know

682
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:06,500
goes back to the point I was saying

683
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:08,900
earlier about how we can keep innovating

684
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:11,599
materials and make materials more and

685
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:14,150
more sustainable but we're really not

686
00:30:11,599 --> 00:30:17,689
going to solve you know this like

687
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:22,220
circular puzzle until we really address

688
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:25,400
that recovery part and so what I think

689
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:27,319
makes them interesting is that in the

690
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:30,110
short term while products go to the

691
00:30:27,319 --> 00:30:32,329
landfill it'll act as a carbon trap and

692
00:30:30,109 --> 00:30:34,729
then once we do have

693
00:30:32,329 --> 00:30:38,298
the infrastructure required for all

694
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:42,250
sustainable packaging not just hemp it

695
00:30:38,298 --> 00:30:46,668
can then go to a composting facility

696
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:48,230
thank you I want to just point out that

697
00:30:46,669 --> 00:30:51,380
part of the reason we're here today is

698
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:52,610
to identify solutions so we're not just

699
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:54,080
talking about it we're not complaining

700
00:30:52,609 --> 00:30:56,479
and we're actually looking at how we can

701
00:30:54,079 --> 00:30:59,269
create solutions and and address some of

702
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:02,120
these issues Starbucks I want to point

703
00:30:59,269 --> 00:31:04,548
out their lids are of a specific type of

704
00:31:02,119 --> 00:31:07,158
plastic that extra can be toxic it's not

705
00:31:04,548 --> 00:31:09,798
recyclable and they've created a

706
00:31:07,159 --> 00:31:11,539
challenge they're offering 10 million

707
00:31:09,798 --> 00:31:14,839
dollars for companies to come together

708
00:31:11,538 --> 00:31:17,808
and make suggestions for alternatives so

709
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:20,269
that's something to be aware of also I

710
00:31:17,808 --> 00:31:22,668
know that Julie is part of the CCI a

711
00:31:20,269 --> 00:31:25,429
legislative committee pretend

712
00:31:22,669 --> 00:31:27,820
potentially you can also speak Andrew to

713
00:31:25,429 --> 00:31:30,380
how we can we can work to change

714
00:31:27,819 --> 00:31:33,678
regulations how we can move through the

715
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:52,760
legislature legislature and what those

716
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:55,278
steps are what can we do information

717
00:31:52,759 --> 00:31:58,730
have a child resistant packaging all of

718
00:31:55,278 --> 00:32:00,470
this so I'm wondering from the agency's

719
00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:04,069
perspective from the Department of

720
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:05,569
Public Health what are the plans if any

721
00:32:04,069 --> 00:32:10,129
that the Department of Public Health has

722
00:32:05,569 --> 00:32:13,069
for public education about why somebody

723
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:16,460
shouldn't buy that $10 gram and what's

724
00:32:13,069 --> 00:32:19,158
wrong with it and why consumers right

725
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:20,720
now where they're just coming to you

726
00:32:19,159 --> 00:32:22,309
know licensed operators and going why is

727
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,720
this so expensive and why do you use so

728
00:32:22,308 --> 00:32:27,048
much packaging and you're ruining the

729
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:29,240
earth and what's wrong with you like how

730
00:32:27,048 --> 00:32:31,700
the departments and agencies can help

731
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:33,558
the licensed operators with the

732
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:36,649
education of the public of why they

733
00:32:33,558 --> 00:32:39,408
should care that they're using you know

734
00:32:36,648 --> 00:32:43,009
really expensive but you know laboratory

735
00:32:39,409 --> 00:32:46,880
tested and well packaged products

736
00:32:43,009 --> 00:32:50,390
I think this the fact that licensed

737
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:52,880
products are laboratory tested has to be

738
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:54,950
a huge selling point for people so III

739
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:58,580
do think it's an area where there needs

740
00:32:54,950 --> 00:33:00,799
to be more education the bureau so

741
00:32:58,579 --> 00:33:02,869
there's three state offices for cannabis

742
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:04,609
we're one of them and then the Bureau of

743
00:33:02,869 --> 00:33:07,509
cannabis control which most people are

744
00:33:04,609 --> 00:33:10,909
familiar with is the lead agency for

745
00:33:07,509 --> 00:33:14,420
cannabis so the bureau put in their

746
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:17,570
budget request for this year money for a

747
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:21,320
public education campaign on that very

748
00:33:17,569 --> 00:33:23,329
issue so both consumer education and for

749
00:33:21,319 --> 00:33:26,299
educating people about how to come into

750
00:33:23,329 --> 00:33:27,949
the licensed market we're still all so

751
00:33:26,299 --> 00:33:29,329
this is part of the state process we're

752
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:31,940
still all going through our budgeting

753
00:33:29,329 --> 00:33:33,799
processes but I think something like

754
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:36,140
that would go a long way towards helping

755
00:33:33,799 --> 00:33:38,809
people understand how these products

756
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:40,820
that come from licensed companies are

757
00:33:38,809 --> 00:33:43,839
different not only for the product

758
00:33:40,819 --> 00:33:46,339
itself but because you know that that

759
00:33:43,839 --> 00:33:48,169
manufacturer located down the street

760
00:33:46,339 --> 00:33:50,480
from this place that you go to all the

761
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:52,400
time is not a safety risk for your

762
00:33:50,480 --> 00:34:00,259
community I think even things like that

763
00:33:52,400 --> 00:34:02,300
are important for people to know how do

764
00:34:00,259 --> 00:34:04,789
we make these changes what can we do as

765
00:34:02,299 --> 00:34:06,619
individuals to make those changes

766
00:34:04,789 --> 00:34:08,500
there's a Los Angeles City Council

767
00:34:06,619 --> 00:34:11,539
meeting tomorrow morning at 8:30 a.m.

768
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:15,019
everybody gonna be there all of you I'll

769
00:34:11,539 --> 00:34:18,099
be looking for you I mean those things I

770
00:34:15,019 --> 00:34:22,099
mean that's the thing that those things

771
00:34:18,099 --> 00:34:24,918
actually work the people who show up who

772
00:34:22,099 --> 00:34:26,329
make the public comments you know some

773
00:34:24,918 --> 00:34:29,000
of the things being discussed tomorrow

774
00:34:26,329 --> 00:34:31,159
that the state has introduced the s-type

775
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:33,409
license for shared facilities which is

776
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:36,590
huge for small businesses and smaller

777
00:34:33,409 --> 00:34:39,440
operators Los Angeles needs to introduce

778
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:41,059
this license type as a local option

779
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:43,369
because we don't have that license type

780
00:34:41,059 --> 00:34:44,809
there's many many facilities ready to go

781
00:34:43,369 --> 00:34:46,759
that could do it if they could get a

782
00:34:44,809 --> 00:34:50,269
shared license authorization there at

783
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:51,649
the local level you know Los Angeles I'm

784
00:34:50,269 --> 00:34:53,030
just speaking specifically Los Angeles

785
00:34:51,648 --> 00:34:55,039
Los Angeles doesn't have any testing

786
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:56,169
labs we got a test July 1st everything's

787
00:34:55,039 --> 00:34:58,119
gotta be tested we don't have a

788
00:34:56,168 --> 00:35:01,150
the lab in los angeles it's gonna be a

789
00:34:58,119 --> 00:35:04,780
problem i think there's what what like

790
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:08,588
eight 18 13 how many lab there's like 20

791
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:13,569
or so we're up to 20 or so great so you

792
00:35:08,588 --> 00:35:16,210
know 20 labs let's do it every product

793
00:35:13,568 --> 00:35:18,759
has to be tested so los angeles is

794
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:20,650
looking to mainline an emergency you

795
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:22,329
know licensing process for testing

796
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:26,380
laboratories in los angeles because we

797
00:35:22,329 --> 00:35:29,048
need them there are there were 55 i

798
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:30,760
think we're down to 37 bills currently

799
00:35:29,048 --> 00:35:33,338
going through at the state level that

800
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:36,880
have to do with cannabis issues some of

801
00:35:33,338 --> 00:35:38,019
these would impact operators like you

802
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,369
couldn't believe like there's a bill

803
00:35:38,019 --> 00:35:41,349
right now that's trying to define a

804
00:35:39,369 --> 00:35:45,130
mature plant as anything that's 18

805
00:35:41,349 --> 00:35:48,548
inches that doesn't work for a lot of

806
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:49,838
people that's arguable so so knowing

807
00:35:48,548 --> 00:35:51,639
that those things are happening at the

808
00:35:49,838 --> 00:35:53,380
local level at the state level you have

809
00:35:51,639 --> 00:35:56,078
to show up you have to say your opinion

810
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:57,849
you have to not be crazy when you show

811
00:35:56,079 --> 00:36:02,829
up and say your opinion i'm just gonna

812
00:35:57,849 --> 00:36:04,690
say that too like don't don't go up at

813
00:36:02,829 --> 00:36:07,000
the city council meeting and be like we

814
00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:08,099
want an unregulated market ship is

815
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,440
sailed

816
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:13,900
we want a regulated market i got a kid i

817
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:15,789
want good schools i want roads you know

818
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:18,160
i want things i want this money to be

819
00:36:15,789 --> 00:36:20,619
distributed well i want an equity

820
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:23,108
program i want social justice that's why

821
00:36:20,619 --> 00:36:25,240
I voted for it yes many people are

822
00:36:23,108 --> 00:36:28,150
having you know voters remorse about

823
00:36:25,239 --> 00:36:31,029
prop 64 we didn't know exactly how it

824
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:35,039
was gonna shake down but it was time and

825
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:38,559
the main thing is that it is a moving

826
00:36:35,039 --> 00:36:40,509
evolutionary process that is not over

827
00:36:38,559 --> 00:36:43,298
that is never even when the full

828
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:46,000
language comes out it's not over you can

829
00:36:43,298 --> 00:36:47,920
do like bills you can do like politics

830
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:52,358
everything we saw in School House Rock

831
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:54,880
is real like you can do it you can make

832
00:36:52,358 --> 00:36:57,159
a petition you know whatever it sounds

833
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:59,230
ridiculous but the world is you know

834
00:36:57,159 --> 00:37:01,358
crazy and anything's possible at this

835
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:05,909
point so the main thing is being engaged

836
00:37:01,358 --> 00:37:08,250
and the one thing that I will say again

837
00:37:05,909 --> 00:37:11,549
my feeling is you

838
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:14,639
the big thing right now is you know

839
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:17,070
pathways to compliance how do we get

840
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:18,049
more people participating in this

841
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:21,480
industry

842
00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:23,730
nobody genuinely who wants to

843
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:26,880
participate in the cannabis industry is

844
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:29,639
your enemy like the days of small groups

845
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:33,780
battling with other small groups is over

846
00:37:29,639 --> 00:37:36,089
the Giants at the gate are just hovering

847
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:39,420
you know you look at what I now call the

848
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:41,940
Canadian Menace the Canadian like most

849
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:48,150
major companies in Canada trace it back

850
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:50,900
who owns them this industry is changing

851
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:53,550
in front of our eyes there's huge

852
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:55,769
multinational corporations itching to

853
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:57,090
come by your companies you know some of

854
00:37:55,769 --> 00:37:58,949
that's great someone maybe that's what

855
00:37:57,090 --> 00:38:01,920
you want to do that's great but if you

856
00:37:58,949 --> 00:38:04,859
want to preserve the dream of the

857
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:08,849
industry that has kind of existed the

858
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:10,019
time for action is now it is gonna be

859
00:38:08,849 --> 00:38:12,329
over soon

860
00:38:10,019 --> 00:38:14,610
and as I've always said the main

861
00:38:12,329 --> 00:38:16,170
beautiful potential of this industry is

862
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:18,930
that the world has always been filled

863
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:21,180
with like healers and shamans and cool

864
00:38:18,929 --> 00:38:23,029
people but they've never been sitting on

865
00:38:21,179 --> 00:38:26,250
top of a multi-billion dollar industry

866
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:28,500
that they need to like own and get

867
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:29,909
politically active and like donate to

868
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:32,519
politicians you want to change some

869
00:38:29,909 --> 00:38:34,589
stuff donate to some politicians they

870
00:38:32,519 --> 00:38:35,610
will listen to you it's crazy doesn't

871
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:37,890
one thing I've learned at the state

872
00:38:35,610 --> 00:38:41,610
level it's pay to play it's like the

873
00:38:37,889 --> 00:38:44,489
Sunset Strip out there man but but when

874
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:45,539
you have the seat at the table have a

875
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:50,099
good story

876
00:38:45,539 --> 00:38:53,550
don't be crazy okay so I just wanted to

877
00:38:50,099 --> 00:38:55,559
tell you all before the panel Julie told

878
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:57,720
me that she has to be out of here at 8

879
00:38:55,559 --> 00:39:04,820
o'clock because she's going to theater

880
00:38:57,719 --> 00:39:07,529
and I feel like she's a show woman I

881
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:11,970
want to piggyback off of that a little

882
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:15,990
bit because I think especially because

883
00:39:11,969 --> 00:39:18,899
this is sort of Co marketed or whatever

884
00:39:15,989 --> 00:39:20,189
the relationship is with cc MA it's

885
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:22,380
important to talk about industry

886
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:25,200
associations so

887
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:28,140
see CMAC CIA there's a number of local

888
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:30,480
ones any sort of outlet like that where

889
00:39:28,139 --> 00:39:33,509
you come together and you make your

890
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:36,269
voice a little bit louder is really

891
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:38,070
valuable I think for us as regulators

892
00:39:36,269 --> 00:39:40,139
sometimes we look to industry groups and

893
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:42,420
we say hey what are all of your

894
00:39:40,139 --> 00:39:45,150
membership saying about this are all of

895
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:47,369
your membership confused about this is

896
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:49,619
there some issue that this collective

897
00:39:47,369 --> 00:39:53,750
group that you represent is having

898
00:39:49,619 --> 00:39:53,750
trouble with and that really helps us

899
00:39:54,469 --> 00:39:59,039
just to piggyback on Courtney's question

900
00:39:57,030 --> 00:40:01,230
on how to influence legislation and

901
00:39:59,039 --> 00:40:02,489
regulation change I think first of all

902
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:03,750
you're doing it right now you're here

903
00:40:02,489 --> 00:40:05,819
you're attending you're learning that's

904
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:10,500
that's the first step here yeah that's

905
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:12,960
really the first step in addition I know

906
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:15,480
Julie spoke to this earlier but you know

907
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:17,849
regulations changed again you know a few

908
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:19,530
weeks ago and by law not just with

909
00:40:17,849 --> 00:40:22,319
cannabis other regulations as well

910
00:40:19,530 --> 00:40:25,019
there's a public comment period not very

911
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:26,730
long especially this last one but yeah

912
00:40:25,019 --> 00:40:28,259
you know that's your time that's your

913
00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:30,210
time to talk and that's your time to get

914
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:33,600
your answers out there your questions

915
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:35,039
and your feedback and by law the state

916
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:37,199
has to listen doesn't mean they have to

917
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:38,340
act but they have to listen so that's

918
00:40:37,199 --> 00:40:40,889
the first thing you can do and that's

919
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:42,329
the public forum the next suggestion I

920
00:40:40,889 --> 00:40:45,179
would have for every single one of you

921
00:40:42,329 --> 00:40:47,369
out there is based on my experience so

922
00:40:45,179 --> 00:40:48,949
far in the last few months all three

923
00:40:47,369 --> 00:40:51,839
government agencies regulating cannabis

924
00:40:48,949 --> 00:40:53,849
wants people to be and companies to be

925
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:55,440
in the system I know it's a challenge

926
00:40:53,849 --> 00:40:57,329
know what's gonna cost money it's a

927
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:00,000
burden to entry but if all that being

928
00:40:57,329 --> 00:41:01,650
said they want us to get out of the gray

929
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,539
market in the black market they want us

930
00:41:01,650 --> 00:41:06,269
to be legit want us to be legal so all

931
00:41:03,539 --> 00:41:09,029
that being said submit your questions

932
00:41:06,269 --> 00:41:11,280
online there go to the BCC go to CD pH

933
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:13,170
go to CDFA there's website that just

934
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:15,540
says email for questions they will

935
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:18,360
answer you do not even have to be some

936
00:41:15,539 --> 00:41:20,789
huge corporation answers ask a question

937
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:22,349
is an individual why not what's the

938
00:41:20,789 --> 00:41:24,630
worst that can do not answer and again

939
00:41:22,349 --> 00:41:25,949
from my experience so far answers have

940
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:27,960
been excellent they've been timely

941
00:41:25,949 --> 00:41:30,750
they've been promptly and it's

942
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:32,820
effectively again everyone wants this to

943
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:34,050
happen in the right way so if you ask

944
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:36,180
the right questions in the right way

945
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:37,710
based on my experience so far

946
00:41:36,179 --> 00:41:40,528
the you know government agencies are

947
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:44,099
gonna respond in the right way thank you

948
00:41:40,528 --> 00:41:46,230
I asked Christina if it's possible for

949
00:41:44,099 --> 00:41:48,470
individuals or companies to send their

950
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:50,369
actual packaging and ask for input and

951
00:41:48,469 --> 00:41:53,278
unfortunately I think that time has

952
00:41:50,369 --> 00:41:57,000
passed I personally did send several

953
00:41:53,278 --> 00:41:58,769
emails asking for guidance and I did

954
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:01,260
receive prompt responses that were quite

955
00:41:58,769 --> 00:42:03,088
hopeful and there's one more thing I

956
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:04,710
want to talk about and then I think we

957
00:42:03,088 --> 00:42:06,210
should probably open up to questions so

958
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:08,699
start thinking about what you want to

959
00:42:06,210 --> 00:42:11,490
ask while you still listen to us lab

960
00:42:08,699 --> 00:42:14,699
testing so for a lab testing its pass or

961
00:42:11,489 --> 00:42:16,379
fail and when you said you're talking

962
00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:18,949
about your child and it just reminded me

963
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:21,838
that you know cannabis as medicine and

964
00:42:18,949 --> 00:42:24,179
cannabis is medicine for adults and for

965
00:42:21,838 --> 00:42:25,980
children so when we have a pass or a

966
00:42:24,179 --> 00:42:27,750
fail if we have some of this critical

967
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:29,400
illness there is a concern that those

968
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:32,190
trace amounts of pesticides can be

969
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:34,588
harmful so not all of us have healthy

970
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:37,559
immune systems I'm son of us are looking

971
00:42:34,588 --> 00:42:39,869
at what that what that can do to

972
00:42:37,559 --> 00:42:42,210
compromise our health and it's something

973
00:42:39,869 --> 00:42:44,068
worth noting so I just like to turn to

974
00:42:42,210 --> 00:42:45,778
love you and ask if you've had any

975
00:42:44,068 --> 00:42:48,389
instances where this is something that's

976
00:42:45,778 --> 00:42:49,829
come to your forefront or perhaps maybe

977
00:42:48,389 --> 00:42:51,900
there's other ways that we should be

978
00:42:49,829 --> 00:43:00,119
approaching lab testing besides a pass

979
00:42:51,900 --> 00:43:02,190
or fail anyone you know just to be

980
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:04,710
honest the latest regulations that pass

981
00:43:02,190 --> 00:43:06,510
by the BCC changes change some of the

982
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:10,679
tolerance levels for for some of the

983
00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:13,380
testing and it's a challenge it is it's

984
00:43:10,679 --> 00:43:16,919
a capital expense to buy that kind of

985
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:18,420
machinery to perform these tests I don't

986
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:21,450
really have a good answer unfortunately

987
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:22,619
but you know again as the laws of law

988
00:43:21,449 --> 00:43:25,078
and these are the these are the path

989
00:43:22,619 --> 00:43:26,460
that's been been directed so you know

990
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:28,680
you can either try to influence

991
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:30,599
legislation and hope it goes back or I

992
00:43:28,679 --> 00:43:33,028
hate to say it grin and bear it because

993
00:43:30,599 --> 00:43:34,410
it's probably going to be a reality you

994
00:43:33,028 --> 00:43:36,469
know I think that almost everything that

995
00:43:34,409 --> 00:43:39,690
gets passed that has to do with safety

996
00:43:36,469 --> 00:43:41,068
generally doesn't get taken back so when

997
00:43:39,690 --> 00:43:43,139
we talk about these pesticides solvents

998
00:43:41,068 --> 00:43:45,690
and these tests aside levels being you

999
00:43:43,139 --> 00:43:47,190
know very very stringent I just hate to

1000
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:48,780
admit it guys start finding clean

1001
00:43:47,190 --> 00:43:51,360
material I

1002
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:53,250
should put it I want to piggyback on

1003
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:54,900
that a little bit and say that one of

1004
00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:56,699
the most effective things you can do is

1005
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:59,190
vote for your dog vote with your dollar

1006
00:43:56,699 --> 00:44:01,319
and something you can do while you're

1007
00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:03,690
shopping is look for certain

1008
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:06,330
certifications I'm sure you're all aware

1009
00:44:03,690 --> 00:44:08,550
of the fact that you know not being a

1010
00:44:06,329 --> 00:44:12,119
federally regulated substance cannabis

1011
00:44:08,550 --> 00:44:15,090
is not subject to USDA certification so

1012
00:44:12,119 --> 00:44:16,859
kind of in the absence of those a number

1013
00:44:15,090 --> 00:44:18,870
of third-party certifications to the

1014
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:21,570
rose and something I always do when I'm

1015
00:44:18,869 --> 00:44:23,730
shopping for cannabis products is look

1016
00:44:21,570 --> 00:44:26,580
for either clean green certified or

1017
00:44:23,730 --> 00:44:28,380
certified kind or diem pure which is a

1018
00:44:26,579 --> 00:44:32,940
really cool one because it's for

1019
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:35,280
regenerative cannabis and that's I think

1020
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:37,530
a great way of kind of you know weeding

1021
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:42,740
out a lot of the shit that you otherwise

1022
00:44:37,530 --> 00:44:45,510
get Demeter is a 40-year organization

1023
00:44:42,739 --> 00:44:48,509
biodynamic cultivation it's a bit

1024
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:51,990
esoteric but in the very basic it's a

1025
00:44:48,510 --> 00:44:54,180
more stringent requirement than the FDA

1026
00:44:51,989 --> 00:44:56,009
would require if organic cultivation so

1027
00:44:54,179 --> 00:44:59,579
that's another avenue that you can

1028
00:44:56,010 --> 00:45:01,530
pursue with that let's open up our panel

1029
00:44:59,579 --> 00:45:05,690
to questions how are we doing on time

1030
00:45:01,530 --> 00:45:08,610
Julie okay we have like ten minutes guys

1031
00:45:05,690 --> 00:45:10,530
Jodi Kristina is there any kind of

1032
00:45:08,610 --> 00:45:12,870
certification that you foresee coming

1033
00:45:10,530 --> 00:45:16,320
down to give us more information about

1034
00:45:12,869 --> 00:45:19,949
the microbes or other issues pertaining

1035
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:22,680
into tests pesticides so her question is

1036
00:45:19,949 --> 00:45:26,129
really about labeling and and you know a

1037
00:45:22,679 --> 00:45:29,250
past past lab requirements kind of label

1038
00:45:26,130 --> 00:45:31,260
I don't see that coming because the

1039
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:34,260
truth is if it doesn't pass lab testing

1040
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:39,510
it will not be able to be sold there is

1041
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:42,180
some allowance for certain products if

1042
00:45:39,510 --> 00:45:44,460
they do not pass lab testing they can be

1043
00:45:42,179 --> 00:45:45,839
remediated which you mentioned that word

1044
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:49,740
so I wanted to talk about it a little

1045
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:54,990
bit so if a product fails lab testing

1046
00:45:49,739 --> 00:45:56,759
for any issue other than labeling THC

1047
00:45:54,989 --> 00:45:58,769
concentration something like that so it

1048
00:45:56,760 --> 00:46:01,980
passes because there are pesticides in

1049
00:45:58,769 --> 00:46:03,449
it or there's some mold and flowers a

1050
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:06,389
common

1051
00:46:03,449 --> 00:46:07,859
then it can be remediated if a plan is

1052
00:46:06,389 --> 00:46:09,900
sent to the Department of Public Health

1053
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:12,420
and approved it'll go back to a

1054
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:14,039
manufacturer the manufacturer usually

1055
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:16,110
it's like an extraction process that

1056
00:46:14,039 --> 00:46:18,509
they put it through to try and clear out

1057
00:46:16,110 --> 00:46:21,059
whatever contaminant is in there it

1058
00:46:18,510 --> 00:46:23,670
still has to go back through lab testing

1059
00:46:21,059 --> 00:46:25,349
to confirm that it works so at the end

1060
00:46:23,670 --> 00:46:27,630
of the day the products that you have on

1061
00:46:25,349 --> 00:46:29,099
the shelf are still products that have

1062
00:46:27,630 --> 00:46:33,750
passed lab testing

1063
00:46:29,099 --> 00:46:36,329
I asked Christina what happens if the

1064
00:46:33,750 --> 00:46:39,420
packaging is not compliant and it's past

1065
00:46:36,329 --> 00:46:41,849
the July first deadline and she notified

1066
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:43,680
me that that's a question for the PCC so

1067
00:46:41,849 --> 00:46:46,139
I want you all to be aware of that I

1068
00:46:43,679 --> 00:46:48,269
think at this point the BCC is intending

1069
00:46:46,139 --> 00:46:50,219
to provide education and guidance as

1070
00:46:48,269 --> 00:46:52,230
opposed to just laying down a hammer so

1071
00:46:50,219 --> 00:46:54,149
we can be a little flexible but we

1072
00:46:52,230 --> 00:46:57,539
should all really strive for this this

1073
00:46:54,150 --> 00:46:59,490
deadline of July 1st questions on that

1074
00:46:57,539 --> 00:47:03,420
really quickly I will say the Bureau has

1075
00:46:59,489 --> 00:47:05,279
a transition period and like a July 1st

1076
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:08,970
fact sheet up on their website that

1077
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:10,769
talks a little bit about I don't think

1078
00:47:08,969 --> 00:47:13,349
they're going to just look the other way

1079
00:47:10,769 --> 00:47:15,119
for packaging again this is a question

1080
00:47:13,349 --> 00:47:17,039
that asks them about how exactly they're

1081
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:19,980
gonna approach it what I can tell you

1082
00:47:17,039 --> 00:47:21,690
that I've seen is that we've had six

1083
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:24,449
months of a transition period and that's

1084
00:47:21,690 --> 00:47:27,900
a relatively short time for a business

1085
00:47:24,449 --> 00:47:31,019
to get up to date on regulations to

1086
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:36,030
order new packaging to in many ways

1087
00:47:31,019 --> 00:47:38,579
raise the bar for compliance but so my

1088
00:47:36,030 --> 00:47:42,510
team reviews every email that comes in

1089
00:47:38,579 --> 00:47:44,639
to our office we got almost no questions

1090
00:47:42,510 --> 00:47:47,580
about packaging and labeling maybe like

1091
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:50,039
a handful over the last the first five

1092
00:47:47,579 --> 00:47:52,259
months of the transition period in the

1093
00:47:50,039 --> 00:47:55,769
past two or three weeks we have been

1094
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:58,050
inundated with questions about packaging

1095
00:47:55,769 --> 00:48:02,070
and labeling can you review my label no

1096
00:47:58,050 --> 00:48:04,110
we cannot is this correct what about

1097
00:48:02,070 --> 00:48:06,150
this requirement and what that says to

1098
00:48:04,110 --> 00:48:08,370
me is that as far as packaging and

1099
00:48:06,150 --> 00:48:10,380
labeling goes I think it was one of the

1100
00:48:08,369 --> 00:48:14,699
last people and one of the last things

1101
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:16,190
on people's minds so I in some ways I'm

1102
00:48:14,699 --> 00:48:18,798
not sure if it's sort of

1103
00:48:16,190 --> 00:48:20,659
six month of a transition period that

1104
00:48:18,798 --> 00:48:24,469
opportunity was squandered a little bit

1105
00:48:20,659 --> 00:48:27,588
or it was an overwhelming everything

1106
00:48:24,469 --> 00:48:29,480
else was on the mind first but at some

1107
00:48:27,588 --> 00:48:31,369
point we have to have an end to the

1108
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:33,798
transition period and the date is July

1109
00:48:31,369 --> 00:48:36,920
1st that's what we announced in November

1110
00:48:33,798 --> 00:48:38,329
so again I would talk to the bureau

1111
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:40,639
about how they're going to enforce this

1112
00:48:38,329 --> 00:48:42,798
at a retail standpoint but at some point

1113
00:48:40,639 --> 00:48:45,230
it has to change over to compliant

1114
00:48:42,798 --> 00:48:47,449
packaging so we can start saying that

1115
00:48:45,230 --> 00:48:49,309
message about the products on the Shelf

1116
00:48:47,449 --> 00:48:52,279
here are different from the products on

1117
00:48:49,309 --> 00:48:54,380
that unlicensed shelf there and I think

1118
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:56,839
many of us know that retailers have

1119
00:48:54,380 --> 00:49:00,039
already stopped accepting packaging that

1120
00:48:56,838 --> 00:49:03,139
is not compliant a gentleman in the back

1121
00:49:00,039 --> 00:49:04,849
can we still use stickers to adjust the

1122
00:49:03,139 --> 00:49:07,250
packaging this has been an interesting

1123
00:49:04,849 --> 00:49:09,798
question because in our transition

1124
00:49:07,250 --> 00:49:11,690
period language in the CDP H emergency

1125
00:49:09,798 --> 00:49:14,179
regulations we talked about you can use

1126
00:49:11,690 --> 00:49:15,559
a sticker to satisfy patent to satisfy

1127
00:49:14,179 --> 00:49:18,019
labeling requirements during the

1128
00:49:15,559 --> 00:49:20,900
transition period and people some people

1129
00:49:18,019 --> 00:49:22,940
read that as you can only use a sticker

1130
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:24,858
during the transition period but that's

1131
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:27,318
not the case you can use a sticker at

1132
00:49:24,858 --> 00:49:29,210
any time as long as it's actually

1133
00:49:27,318 --> 00:49:33,849
adhered to your package and not one of

1134
00:49:29,210 --> 00:49:38,349
those peel away stickers great question

1135
00:49:33,849 --> 00:49:38,349
blue hat backwards

1136
00:49:45,619 --> 00:49:53,460
yes they they rip open so that's your

1137
00:49:48,630 --> 00:49:55,140
tamper evidence and the mylar packaging

1138
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:58,470
when it's heat sealed is that considered

1139
00:49:55,139 --> 00:50:01,558
tamper evident yes that's a good

1140
00:49:58,469 --> 00:50:06,239
indication that someone has been in your

1141
00:50:01,559 --> 00:50:09,630
bud so the only products that have to be

1142
00:50:06,239 --> 00:50:12,179
an opaque packaging are edibles flour

1143
00:50:09,630 --> 00:50:14,490
does not non-edible manufactured

1144
00:50:12,179 --> 00:50:16,699
products do not we get that question a

1145
00:50:14,489 --> 00:50:16,699
lot too

1146
00:50:16,940 --> 00:50:28,710
how about a ziplock if it's Ziploc if

1147
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:31,710
it's well it would have to be child

1148
00:50:28,710 --> 00:50:33,889
resistant reusable like this yes like

1149
00:50:31,710 --> 00:50:33,889
this

1150
00:50:44,030 --> 00:50:50,880
so it says that you can't use an exit

1151
00:50:47,579 --> 00:50:53,639
package so the product packaging itself

1152
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:55,950
is what has to be a child resistant we

1153
00:50:53,639 --> 00:50:58,710
have distinguished we use the term

1154
00:50:55,949 --> 00:51:01,649
secondary package because you could use

1155
00:50:58,710 --> 00:51:03,630
a bag like that to meet the child

1156
00:51:01,650 --> 00:51:04,950
resistant packaging requirements as long

1157
00:51:03,630 --> 00:51:07,050
as it has all of your labeling

1158
00:51:04,949 --> 00:51:10,769
requirements on it your package is

1159
00:51:07,050 --> 00:51:13,740
already packaged into that exit

1160
00:51:10,769 --> 00:51:16,139
packaging is what a retailer puts your

1161
00:51:13,739 --> 00:51:17,368
whole purchase in before you walk out

1162
00:51:16,139 --> 00:51:20,190
the door so that's different from

1163
00:51:17,369 --> 00:51:22,650
secondary packaging so what we're

1164
00:51:20,190 --> 00:51:25,590
looking at is is your product each

1165
00:51:22,650 --> 00:51:27,480
individual product sold in some sort of

1166
00:51:25,590 --> 00:51:28,920
child resistant packaging it could be a

1167
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:31,469
bag it could be something else

1168
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:34,530
so for pre-rolls for example let's IVA

1169
00:51:31,469 --> 00:51:36,899
pre-roll package if it's not if it's not

1170
00:51:34,530 --> 00:51:39,300
child resistant that solution to bring

1171
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:41,430
it to market by July first can be a

1172
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:44,039
child resistant package it would be an

1173
00:51:41,429 --> 00:51:45,569
additional expense but it will it will

1174
00:51:44,039 --> 00:51:56,789
bring you compliant so that's that's

1175
00:51:45,570 --> 00:51:59,300
something worth noting see the CBD and

1176
00:51:56,789 --> 00:52:01,940
THC will be kept separate or

1177
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:04,760
but are you working with the TTP at all

1178
00:52:01,940 --> 00:52:08,269
in on packaging with alcoholic beverages

1179
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:10,430
that are including CBDs and not nice

1180
00:52:08,269 --> 00:52:17,929
like non psychoactive effects with like

1181
00:52:10,429 --> 00:52:20,239
turkey so it's a it's a you repeat the

1182
00:52:17,929 --> 00:52:22,730
question so his question is about

1183
00:52:20,239 --> 00:52:30,529
alcoholic beverages being infused with

1184
00:52:22,730 --> 00:52:32,179
THC and/or CBD either way so that would

1185
00:52:30,530 --> 00:52:34,910
be a manufactured product if you're

1186
00:52:32,179 --> 00:52:37,009
talking about CBD from cannabis and we

1187
00:52:34,909 --> 00:52:40,099
specifically prohibit alcoholic

1188
00:52:37,010 --> 00:52:42,200
beverages from being sold as cannabis

1189
00:52:40,099 --> 00:52:44,089
products it doesn't matter if it's THC

1190
00:52:42,199 --> 00:52:46,789
or CBD

1191
00:52:44,090 --> 00:52:50,120
there's also CBD from industrial hemp

1192
00:52:46,789 --> 00:52:51,829
which Marisa specifically excludes from

1193
00:52:50,119 --> 00:52:53,630
the definition of cannabis so it doesn't

1194
00:52:51,829 --> 00:52:55,340
fall under our office

1195
00:52:53,630 --> 00:52:56,930
but from what I understand with the

1196
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:58,880
offices that it does fall under it's

1197
00:52:56,929 --> 00:53:00,619
still prohibited it's a good question

1198
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:02,750
because we are seeing a number of beers

1199
00:53:00,619 --> 00:53:05,719
that are including cannabis across the

1200
00:53:02,750 --> 00:53:09,289
nation young lady here with the blonde

1201
00:53:05,719 --> 00:53:11,839
hair please a physician endorsed formula

1202
00:53:09,289 --> 00:53:17,509
how would we add it to the label and who

1203
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:19,490
would we speak to so obviously I could

1204
00:53:17,510 --> 00:53:22,460
be corrected here but one of the

1205
00:53:19,489 --> 00:53:24,919
requirements for all manufactured labels

1206
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:26,809
is that the product that every claim

1207
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:30,230
must be truthful and factual on the

1208
00:53:26,809 --> 00:53:32,119
label so if you have a clinical study

1209
00:53:30,230 --> 00:53:35,329
from a physician that you could actually

1210
00:53:32,119 --> 00:53:37,039
document in sight as backup if some

1211
00:53:35,329 --> 00:53:39,319
regulatory agency came knocking on your

1212
00:53:37,039 --> 00:53:41,449
door I think that you would be okay to

1213
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:43,280
include that and as already previous men

1214
00:53:41,449 --> 00:53:45,109
should previously discussed there is no

1215
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:47,150
quote-unquote label approval that has to

1216
00:53:45,110 --> 00:53:50,019
go through the state with California now

1217
00:53:47,150 --> 00:53:52,700
that all being said I strongly

1218
00:53:50,019 --> 00:53:54,800
discourage this practice because what

1219
00:53:52,699 --> 00:53:57,079
you're doing is the moment we start

1220
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:59,900
making we as the industry start making

1221
00:53:57,079 --> 00:54:02,239
drug and health claims on our products

1222
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:06,019
you open the door for the FDA to come in

1223
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:07,579
and now look at you so you know we are

1224
00:54:06,019 --> 00:54:08,599
legal within the state of California and

1225
00:54:07,579 --> 00:54:10,279
we followed the rules within the state

1226
00:54:08,599 --> 00:54:12,589
of California but you start saying pain

1227
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:13,370
relief cures cancer you know all this

1228
00:54:12,590 --> 00:54:14,510
kind of stuff

1229
00:54:13,369 --> 00:54:15,859
you better have some sort of

1230
00:54:14,510 --> 00:54:17,030
documentation behind it to back it or

1231
00:54:15,860 --> 00:54:20,650
else you're just opening the door for

1232
00:54:17,030 --> 00:54:24,590
legislation you can say things like

1233
00:54:20,650 --> 00:54:25,880
there's a relaxing physical effect but

1234
00:54:24,590 --> 00:54:29,450
you have to be pretty cautious I'm sorry

1235
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:31,610
good yeah so there is a provision that

1236
00:54:29,449 --> 00:54:33,309
talks about health related statements so

1237
00:54:31,610 --> 00:54:36,620
if you're talking about one specific

1238
00:54:33,309 --> 00:54:39,829
physician said this one specific thing

1239
00:54:36,619 --> 00:54:41,809
and again backed up by a study maybe you

1240
00:54:39,829 --> 00:54:45,529
could get away with it I have to second

1241
00:54:41,809 --> 00:54:47,029
him I wouldn't do it the there the

1242
00:54:45,530 --> 00:54:49,190
provision about health related

1243
00:54:47,030 --> 00:54:54,110
statements so you're talking about

1244
00:54:49,190 --> 00:54:56,869
treats this disease cures insomnia

1245
00:54:54,110 --> 00:55:01,960
something like that those are only

1246
00:54:56,869 --> 00:55:05,059
permitted if there is a consensus of

1247
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:09,260
science I can't remember the exact

1248
00:55:05,059 --> 00:55:12,190
wording but it is a significant

1249
00:55:09,260 --> 00:55:15,590
scientific agreement and peer-reviewed

1250
00:55:12,190 --> 00:55:19,280
studies and at this point there is not

1251
00:55:15,590 --> 00:55:23,870
that there is a provision that allows

1252
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:26,710
you to include statements about what we

1253
00:55:23,869 --> 00:55:29,779
call characteristic anticipated effects

1254
00:55:26,710 --> 00:55:31,400
so that's like something that informs

1255
00:55:29,780 --> 00:55:32,900
the consumer about what they might feel

1256
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:35,570
if they take the product so might make

1257
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:37,670
you drowsy might have a relaxing effect

1258
00:55:35,570 --> 00:55:39,500
something like that but yeah the second

1259
00:55:37,670 --> 00:55:41,869
you start to get into anything disease

1260
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:45,789
related you are really inviting a level

1261
00:55:41,869 --> 00:55:49,339
of scrutiny that I don't think you want

1262
00:55:45,789 --> 00:55:52,730
this gentleman over here with the rosin

1263
00:55:49,340 --> 00:55:55,789
hat on so his question is about

1264
00:55:52,730 --> 00:55:58,789
characters cartoons it's essentially

1265
00:55:55,789 --> 00:56:00,769
there's a provision that one of the

1266
00:55:58,789 --> 00:56:04,340
labeling prohibitions is anything that

1267
00:56:00,769 --> 00:56:06,050
is intended to be or is attractive to

1268
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:10,130
children and it lists a couple of

1269
00:56:06,050 --> 00:56:12,680
examples cartoons are one the word candy

1270
00:56:10,130 --> 00:56:13,849
or candies is one there's a couple of

1271
00:56:12,679 --> 00:56:16,579
things so we've gotten a lot of

1272
00:56:13,849 --> 00:56:18,440
questions about this since the rules

1273
00:56:16,579 --> 00:56:20,360
originally came out and it was

1274
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:22,579
essentially the question that we usually

1275
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:24,289
get is something like can you tell me

1276
00:56:22,579 --> 00:56:26,869
exactly what this means

1277
00:56:24,289 --> 00:56:29,480
and that's a really hard question for us

1278
00:56:26,869 --> 00:56:32,750
to answer because every time we've tried

1279
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:35,990
to put really concrete regulatory terms

1280
00:56:32,750 --> 00:56:38,630
around it you either end up looping in

1281
00:56:35,989 --> 00:56:42,889
things that are not attractive to

1282
00:56:38,630 --> 00:56:48,140
children or not including things that

1283
00:56:42,889 --> 00:56:51,500
really are so the way it's worded is you

1284
00:56:48,139 --> 00:56:53,750
cannot include labeling or images that

1285
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:54,949
are attractive to children as determined

1286
00:56:53,750 --> 00:56:57,949
by the department on a case-by-case

1287
00:56:54,949 --> 00:57:00,109
basis if you have a question about

1288
00:56:57,949 --> 00:57:02,529
something on your label like that you

1289
00:57:00,110 --> 00:57:05,960
can send it to us and we'll look at it

1290
00:57:02,530 --> 00:57:08,530
but it's really challenging so I'll tell

1291
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:11,599
you what we sort of look for in general

1292
00:57:08,530 --> 00:57:14,360
the thing that I usually say is we look

1293
00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:16,639
at the totality of the package just

1294
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:20,450
because you include like a graphic on it

1295
00:57:16,639 --> 00:57:22,429
if it is an adult-themed package and it

1296
00:57:20,449 --> 00:57:23,899
just happens to have a drawing on it

1297
00:57:22,429 --> 00:57:25,759
that's not necessarily attractive to

1298
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:27,530
children there are some things that we

1299
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:30,770
look at in the market that are so

1300
00:57:27,530 --> 00:57:33,920
attractive to children and we're like

1301
00:57:30,769 --> 00:57:35,239
there's no question about it and then

1302
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:37,430
there's some things that are clearly

1303
00:57:35,239 --> 00:57:39,079
marketed to adults it's the gray area

1304
00:57:37,429 --> 00:57:40,579
that's a little bit harder so if you

1305
00:57:39,079 --> 00:57:42,949
want me to look at it you can bring it

1306
00:57:40,579 --> 00:57:48,469
up afterwards or you can email us that's

1307
00:57:42,949 --> 00:57:49,399
very kind thank you I have cards here if

1308
00:57:48,469 --> 00:57:52,759
anyone wants them

1309
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:55,760
great I think with that we need to

1310
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:59,030
