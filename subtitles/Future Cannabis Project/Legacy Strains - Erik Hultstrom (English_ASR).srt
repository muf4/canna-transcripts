1
00:00:00,869 --> 00:00:07,799
so Eric let's put you on the the

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:12,300
cannabis business psychiatrist chair so

3
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:15,528
to tell us I I want to dig into kind of

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:18,269
your path in your journey so so you're

5
00:00:15,528 --> 00:00:21,149
do you know anyone else who is as small

6
00:00:18,269 --> 00:00:23,789
as you are from a cultivation

7
00:00:21,149 --> 00:00:28,500
square-footage standpoint which is 2,500

8
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:30,179
square feet no no a lot a lot of my

9
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,518
friends that work with you know they

10
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:36,479
have been much larger facilities 10,000

11
00:00:32,518 --> 00:00:39,000
square feet you know I'm a bit of a liar

12
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:41,089
Lauren do you know any cultivators that

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,558
are only at 2500 square feet

14
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:46,500
[Music]

15
00:00:42,558 --> 00:00:49,409
Oh better hey I might know one or two

16
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:56,159
but not that I can think of it doesn't

17
00:00:49,409 --> 00:00:59,819
jump out at you all right is it by

18
00:00:56,159 --> 00:01:02,909
choice is it by necessity as a tactical

19
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:08,028
you're you're you're playing chess when

20
00:01:02,909 --> 00:01:10,078
everyone else is playing checkers yeah

21
00:01:08,028 --> 00:01:12,179
you know that's an interesting question

22
00:01:10,078 --> 00:01:14,038
how much how many businesses are like oh

23
00:01:12,179 --> 00:01:19,379
yeah I like being really really small

24
00:01:14,039 --> 00:01:21,179
you know going bigger if it's kind of

25
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:24,179
you know I've been in this since early

26
00:01:21,179 --> 00:01:27,118
2005 so I've kind of seen the evolution

27
00:01:24,179 --> 00:01:30,840
of this industry and I would say

28
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:33,090
probably around 2009 or 10 you started

29
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,579
noticing more outside money coming in

30
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:36,418
you know back in the Bush years

31
00:01:34,578 --> 00:01:39,748
everybody was scared to get into

32
00:01:36,418 --> 00:01:41,310
cannabis unless you were okay with the

33
00:01:39,748 --> 00:01:43,918
idea of going to jail for selling

34
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:46,469
cannabis you know a lot of a lot of

35
00:01:43,918 --> 00:01:48,718
people that's not okay with them you

36
00:01:46,468 --> 00:01:51,358
know it's kind of a few of us kind of

37
00:01:48,718 --> 00:01:53,519
nuts that hit that were okay with at a

38
00:01:51,358 --> 00:01:54,328
time but it's what we had to do so you

39
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:56,488
know when the when the Obama

40
00:01:54,328 --> 00:01:58,228
administration came in people started to

41
00:01:56,489 --> 00:02:00,058
get less fearful going to prison for

42
00:01:58,228 --> 00:02:02,459
cannabis he started seeing more people

43
00:02:00,058 --> 00:02:07,289
entering the space that were hesitant to

44
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:09,118
do it before and by about 2010 or 11 we

45
00:02:07,289 --> 00:02:11,430
I just started noticing more and more

46
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:14,430
money come in and where I saw that money

47
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:17,129
backing up were operating

48
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:18,480
is that you know to me I had known and

49
00:02:17,128 --> 00:02:20,908
they had been around and I wasn't very

50
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:25,408
confident in their abilities to scale up

51
00:02:20,908 --> 00:02:27,209
and so fast-forward further to 2014 you

52
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:29,310
know I got my small warehouse here and

53
00:02:27,209 --> 00:02:31,859
by 2014 a 5,000 square-foot warehouse

54
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:35,188
was not on the low end of things you

55
00:02:31,859 --> 00:02:37,260
know it was it was medium to small you

56
00:02:35,188 --> 00:02:38,908
know but you know people were just

57
00:02:37,259 --> 00:02:42,090
starting to look at 20,000 square-foot

58
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:44,548
warehouse and really going bigger so as

59
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:46,348
this is going even more money is coming

60
00:02:44,549 --> 00:02:49,409
in and these operations are kind of

61
00:02:46,348 --> 00:02:51,839
getting very inefficient and then as we

62
00:02:49,408 --> 00:02:54,120
were looking to expand about 2016 and we

63
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:57,359
started having to compete with the

64
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:59,280
really cheap money out there and we

65
00:02:57,359 --> 00:03:02,579
looked at a bunch of spaces we spent

66
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:05,340
about a year and we we landlord started

67
00:03:02,579 --> 00:03:07,109
charging exorbitant fees for space you

68
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:09,239
know we look at places with rent like a

69
00:03:07,109 --> 00:03:12,569
$3 a square foot and it was completely

70
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:15,150
unsustainable so for us we're a

71
00:03:12,568 --> 00:03:17,068
bootstrap operation we can't you know we

72
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:20,669
don't have a huge fund to operate at a

73
00:03:17,068 --> 00:03:23,158
loss and as we try to gain market share

74
00:03:20,669 --> 00:03:25,530
so basically just put my head down and

75
00:03:23,158 --> 00:03:28,590
we were just gonna work with what we had

76
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:30,299
and just try to weather the storm I knew

77
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:34,139
at some point the bubble would pop and

78
00:03:30,299 --> 00:03:36,719
if you have a large operation that is it

79
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:39,479
isn't making money it's just a lot more

80
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:41,489
to cover and so with us we've kept a

81
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:44,879
small lean operation so going through

82
00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:47,430
this you know we we've really had a easy

83
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:50,908
time managing the storm and at some

84
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:52,859
point when this pops my idea was some of

85
00:03:50,908 --> 00:03:56,298
these companies are not gonna make it

86
00:03:52,859 --> 00:03:58,799
because then they're just structurally

87
00:03:56,299 --> 00:04:00,810
incapable of surviving and so when that

88
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:03,209
happens permits are gonna be coming up

89
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:04,530
the price should drop from 3 bucks a

90
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:06,900
square foot down to something reasonable

91
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:11,370
even a dollar 50 which is still a little

92
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:13,769
overpriced but still can work so that's

93
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:16,858
the plan is just keeping solid with our

94
00:04:13,769 --> 00:04:20,038
small operation how running tight books

95
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:21,839
and you know we'll grab the opportunity

96
00:04:20,038 --> 00:04:23,339
when it makes sense and you know over

97
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:26,089
the last three four years looking at it

98
00:04:23,339 --> 00:04:28,339
it hasn't made sense and we looked at

99
00:04:26,089 --> 00:04:31,039
expansion would mean something

100
00:04:28,339 --> 00:04:33,918
sustainable and I would mean bringing on

101
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,720
more investors and you know I'm in this

102
00:04:33,918 --> 00:04:37,609
for the long run I want to have a

103
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:40,400
company ten years from now 20 years from

104
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:41,840
now and we're not you know when we

105
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:43,459
weren't trying to build something up and

106
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:47,119
just flip it and get on it you know I

107
00:04:43,459 --> 00:04:49,579
got I'm a lifer Eric this is super

108
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:53,870
interesting one of the themes that's

109
00:04:49,579 --> 00:04:58,370
raised it's interesting that in the

110
00:04:53,870 --> 00:05:01,340
current uncertain times smaller

111
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:04,399
operations may have an advantage over

112
00:05:01,339 --> 00:05:08,509
the larger ones and that smaller

113
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:10,759
operations kind of defines you what do

114
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:12,709
you feel about that and also do you

115
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:15,439
think that you might see real estate

116
00:05:12,709 --> 00:05:17,930
prices start to come down and maybe more

117
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:21,110
opportunities some spaces that were

118
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:26,930
previously unavailable become available

119
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:29,600
I think it has to happen i I can't

120
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:31,459
envision a scenario you know we we all

121
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,010
know there are some larger companies out

122
00:05:31,459 --> 00:05:38,629
there that are running pretty serious

123
00:05:34,009 --> 00:05:41,569
operating deficits and I think if the

124
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:44,209
laws of percentages you know it's a

125
00:05:41,569 --> 00:05:46,219
larger company if everybody's operating

126
00:05:44,209 --> 00:05:48,019
at the same loss percentage the larger

127
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:51,260
company it's really going to be a bigger

128
00:05:48,019 --> 00:05:53,418
number than a smaller company so I mean

129
00:05:51,259 --> 00:05:55,449
that's one thing where I think the

130
00:05:53,418 --> 00:05:57,889
smaller company does have an advantage

131
00:05:55,449 --> 00:05:59,930
obviously you have to do things well

132
00:05:57,889 --> 00:06:01,970
having a small company that's failing

133
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:04,250
versus large company failing it's all

134
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:06,320
failing you know it's just what's the

135
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:08,899
level of failure I mean I've always

136
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:11,779
likened this kind of to the late 90s

137
00:06:08,899 --> 00:06:14,269
dot-com boom where you know you can't

138
00:06:11,779 --> 00:06:17,179
have 10 companies selling pet food

139
00:06:14,269 --> 00:06:18,889
online but at the same time it's gonna

140
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:20,769
come down to just a couple of them some

141
00:06:18,889 --> 00:06:23,418
of them are gonna be inefficient but

142
00:06:20,769 --> 00:06:25,609
weathering the storm especially if all

143
00:06:23,418 --> 00:06:28,490
10 of those companies are operating at

144
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:30,560
deficits operating at the smallest

145
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:32,598
deficit is gonna be the advantage you

146
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,220
know at some point turning that into

147
00:06:32,598 --> 00:06:36,680
round you're going to be the quickest to

148
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:38,870
actually start operating on profits and

149
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:41,209
at that point I think the world's going

150
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:41,720
to be your oyster and with most cannabis

151
00:06:41,209 --> 00:06:44,779
called to be

152
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:47,120
I know I I don't I can't really think of

153
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:49,309
any of them that are really running on

154
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,259
profits right now everybody is some are

155
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:53,540
very close to breaking even and some are

156
00:06:51,259 --> 00:06:55,250
far away from breaking even but I don't

157
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:57,980
really know that any cultivators that

158
00:06:55,250 --> 00:07:00,470
are just you know absolutely destroying

159
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:02,420
it on their books it's you know it's me

160
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:04,760
I'm sure there might be one or two that

161
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:06,920
are kind of barely there but it's just

162
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:09,769
what the tax is where they are it's near

163
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:13,069
impossible so let's dig into this a

164
00:07:09,769 --> 00:07:14,959
little bit and we've talked before we're

165
00:07:13,069 --> 00:07:16,459
friends I've interviewed you and we've

166
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:18,859
talked about your business and you have

167
00:07:16,459 --> 00:07:22,879
tight margins right like you run a

168
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:25,009
really tight lean operation and I think

169
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:27,110
the last time we talked you said like as

170
00:07:25,009 --> 00:07:29,629
long as people are willing to spend you

171
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:33,379
know 50 bucks for an a you're gonna do

172
00:07:29,629 --> 00:07:35,418
okay so our people still willing to see

173
00:07:33,379 --> 00:07:38,120
that and what about the dynamics that

174
00:07:35,418 --> 00:07:40,699
are outside of your control price points

175
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:44,780
at the dispensary and and all of that

176
00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:47,810
all of that stuff that that you know

177
00:07:44,779 --> 00:07:51,319
could potentially affect you really

178
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:54,500
seriously have you had are you changing

179
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:57,409
a lot of shops is your product like what

180
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:58,220
do you you know how have you had to let

181
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:00,919
some people go

182
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:05,830
how have you survived you maintained

183
00:08:00,918 --> 00:08:09,289
with those thin margins we we actually

184
00:08:05,829 --> 00:08:11,269
we we brought one more person on so on

185
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:14,210
ours we haven't let anybody go we've

186
00:08:11,269 --> 00:08:18,049
hired one more person we have is the

187
00:08:14,209 --> 00:08:20,810
team right now we have seven seven

188
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:23,120
employees up from six to seven and then

189
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:26,660
there's three managers which I consider

190
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:29,240
myself a manager as well yeah in that

191
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:30,979
and that's part of it I do a lot of the

192
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:34,399
companies will have four people doing

193
00:08:30,978 --> 00:08:37,848
what I do you know I head of sales I

194
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:42,559
also handle the compliance the metric

195
00:08:37,849 --> 00:08:44,870
the accounting quality control and I and

196
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:47,629
I still do deliveries as well it which

197
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:49,549
is not as far as I know about the only

198
00:08:47,629 --> 00:08:51,230
owner of a company that shows up at

199
00:08:49,549 --> 00:08:53,838
dispensaries with the deliveries and

200
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:54,950
just like hey I'm own or two so but it's

201
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:57,740
great because you know

202
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:59,360
again I'm also I also do the marketing

203
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:01,190
and with no marketing budget you just

204
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:04,009
have to be creative you know and you

205
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:06,800
have to you know my a lot of my

206
00:09:04,009 --> 00:09:08,629
competitors have a large well they used

207
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:10,879
to have a large marketing budgets and I

208
00:09:08,629 --> 00:09:12,950
never had a marketing budget so it's

209
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:16,490
kind of my my strategy is always

210
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:17,840
asymmetrical warfare if if you're you

211
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:20,210
know if your opponents are doing one

212
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:21,800
thing and you can't do it you have to

213
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:23,960
figure out something that they can't do

214
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:26,509
and so with me it was just engagement on

215
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:28,580
the ground level of people at shops they

216
00:09:26,509 --> 00:09:31,250
can spend fifty thousand dollars a month

217
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:33,740
on marketing I can do that but I can go

218
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:35,299
into the shops and personally make

219
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:37,129
connections and bond with the staff

220
00:09:35,299 --> 00:09:39,319
there and get them to become believers

221
00:09:37,129 --> 00:09:40,399
in my product you know and that that's

222
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,650
something you can't do with the

223
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:44,750
marketing budget you know unless you

224
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:47,389
just can't because your team isn't going

225
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:50,299
to go to the same levels that an owner

226
00:09:47,389 --> 00:09:52,580
of company is gonna go to so so just

227
00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:55,549
quickly you're the one managing like the

228
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:57,980
Instagram and all that stuff yeah yeah

229
00:09:55,549 --> 00:10:00,409
yeah as you can see by my whopping 1,500

230
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:04,670
followers so I'm a better farmer than a

231
00:10:00,409 --> 00:10:07,490
social media guy yes I back to price

232
00:10:04,669 --> 00:10:10,789
points you're a quality grower you're

233
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:13,700
like where now do you lay in the in the

234
00:10:10,789 --> 00:10:17,419
in the scale of price points in the

235
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:18,440
shops and how sensitive are they to to

236
00:10:17,419 --> 00:10:23,179
that right now

237
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:25,430
so which which shelf are you on we're

238
00:10:23,179 --> 00:10:27,649

259
00:11:15,259 --> 00:11:19,549
without but but those are our direct

260
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,379
competitors or those companies they're

261
00:11:19,549 --> 00:11:23,569
also doing a very great job they're

262
00:11:21,379 --> 00:11:25,578
producing great flower and they're at

263
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:27,230
price point similar to us what I have

264
00:11:25,578 --> 00:11:28,789
noticed in the last two months is there

265
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:31,100
has been some volatility in the

266
00:11:28,789 --> 00:11:33,049
wholesale market price and I have

267
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:35,778
noticed some downward pressure just

268
00:11:33,049 --> 00:11:38,479
generally you know I think premium price

269
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:40,519
used to be you know about twenty one

270
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,019
dollars to twenty five or twenty six ol

271
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:44,450
sale and I see it starting to kind of

272
00:11:42,019 --> 00:11:46,278
fall to around eighteen to twenty and I

273
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:47,839
think it's starting to get hard no

274
00:11:46,278 --> 00:11:51,439
matter how good the product is to go

275
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:53,120
much over twenty some of them do so

276
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,920
we're starting to really look at

277
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,750
wholesale pricing and how it's gonna

278
00:11:54,919 --> 00:12:00,199
affect our margin as well

279
00:11:56,750 --> 00:12:02,600
and you know and as far as that just

280
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:06,560
getting efficiencies and yield increases

281
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:08,769
to offset any sort of a wholesale price

282
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:11,569
if we have to look that way but you know

283
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:13,759
analyzing wholesale prices is definitely

284
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:15,050
just just from talking to buyers we've

285
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:17,120
been looking new shops

286
00:12:15,049 --> 00:12:19,578
I just brought on a sales person as well

287
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:21,230
to start going to the San Diego area

288
00:12:19,578 --> 00:12:23,750
we're gonna start being carrying down

289
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:25,370
there you know this is always saying

290
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:27,559
we've actually in the last two months

291
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:30,320
been looking more at expanding than

292
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:31,489
contracting so you know it's a it's a

293
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,959
good thing is kind of the moment we've

294
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:36,169
been waiting for and I've been waiting

295
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:38,719
for the kind of crash to happen and this

296
00:12:36,169 --> 00:12:40,699
is for us and a small company I feel

297
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,800
like this is going to be our time here

298
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:44,870
to breakout so that's kind of what we're

299
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:46,609
we're pushing for us or we're definitely

300
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:49,730
be more aggressive right now than we

301
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:51,680
have been well as a tiny company you

302
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:56,959
don't need to be in a lot of shop so how

303
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:59,179
many shops are you in now we as of last

304
00:12:56,958 --> 00:13:02,778
week we were in 16 we are now in 18

305
00:12:59,179 --> 00:13:04,370
shops and you know we're optimistic

306
00:13:02,778 --> 00:13:06,259
we're gonna have three or four more by

307
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:07,639
next week and we're gonna be any close

308
00:13:06,259 --> 00:13:09,769
to our cap I think we can probably

309
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:13,039
sustain right now with our increase

310
00:13:09,769 --> 00:13:14,600
about 24 shops total so we're we're

311
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:16,219
bumping up to that next level and at

312
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,209
that point we're gonna have to stop or

313
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:19,240
else we're not going to be able to

314
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:21,369
supply our existing shops and

315
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:23,769
and then at that point is when we start

316
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:25,839
looking to expand and are you following

317
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:28,179
kind of the craft beer model which is

318
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:30,130
you you can centrically start with your

319
00:13:28,179 --> 00:13:33,159
home turf like you're not trying to sell

320
00:13:30,129 --> 00:13:36,700
up into Humboldt and the Bay Area and

321
00:13:33,159 --> 00:13:39,789
Sacramento as a tiny la brand or are you

322
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:42,070
spreading out yeah a little bit also

323
00:13:39,789 --> 00:13:44,588
about the legacy nature of your of yours

324
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:47,500
of your strains I mean legacy is an

325
00:13:44,589 --> 00:13:50,260
important part of your brand right yeah

326
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:52,240
yeah it is it is which is which is funny

327
00:13:50,259 --> 00:13:54,370
when I thought up the name legacy it

328
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:57,070
wasn't a term for the old heirloom

329
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:59,230
strains that it is now but it just kind

330
00:13:57,070 --> 00:14:01,629
of worked out but you know a big history

331
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:03,730
nerd I've been in shop since early 2005

332
00:14:01,629 --> 00:14:04,929
and I started noticing a lot of the

333
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:07,720
strains from that day were just

334
00:14:04,929 --> 00:14:10,899
disappearing and so pretty much what we

335
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:13,120
run is almost a history library we we

336
00:14:10,899 --> 00:14:15,429
run the heirloom streams most of our

337
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:18,610
stuff is 10 to 30 years old our genetics

338
00:14:15,429 --> 00:14:20,500
you know we have the master Kush which

339
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:22,000
nobody really has we have trainwreck

340
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,278
which is another one that's pretty much

341
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,500
disappeared

342
00:14:23,278 --> 00:14:28,809
we run Sour Diesel but the real the the

343
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:31,240
Massachusetts cunt chem dog from the 90s

344
00:14:28,809 --> 00:14:33,819
that's we run we have a Malibu 9u1 OTV

345
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:37,149
from Rick Shima we got you know we got

346
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:39,278
that from you know all the legendary 90s

347
00:14:37,149 --> 00:14:42,070
grower that passed away about nine years

348
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:44,679
ago but anybody around LA in the early

349
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:48,160
two-thousands knew who rich shiva was of

350
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:49,989
the early shops but yeah we really

351
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:53,230
specialize on the old classic Afghan

352
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:55,839
value always another one we have and you

353
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:58,060
know for me I'm 42 and I know a lot of

354
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:00,850
people who are late 30s and 40s remember

355
00:14:58,059 --> 00:15:03,939
these old strains and you know at some

356
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:07,269
point I lava cakes are good and the

357
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:09,190
various gelatos and sherbert sand it's

358
00:15:07,269 --> 00:15:11,528
great but sometimes you just want those

359
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:13,720
classic strains that you can find in the

360
00:15:11,528 --> 00:15:15,220
big book of buds or you read about you

361
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,570
know in High Times and Rosenthal was

362
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:18,519
going back in the day you know I think

363
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:21,550
there's a lot of appetite for the

364
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:23,169
nostalgia and I just would hate to see

365
00:15:21,549 --> 00:15:26,259
it disappear and since cannabis and

366
00:15:23,169 --> 00:15:27,819
genetics is such an oral history you

367
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:30,909
know it really just relies on kind of

368
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:32,920
storytellers to keep it alive you know

369
00:15:30,909 --> 00:15:36,909
and we're kind of a storyteller

370
00:15:32,919 --> 00:15:38,649
what we grow I think so sorry with 2500

371
00:15:36,909 --> 00:15:42,578
square feet you have how many different

372
00:15:38,649 --> 00:15:44,470
cultivars we have 12 which is not the

373
00:15:42,578 --> 00:15:46,569
most efficient thing and we don't run

374
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:48,730
all 12 at once you know some of them we

375
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:50,709
run more seasonally we probably have

376
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:53,440
four main strains that we do the most of

377
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:55,509
but will rotate in other ones here and

378
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,339
there again just because I just don't

379
00:15:55,509 --> 00:15:59,319
want to lose them and some point we a

380
00:15:57,339 --> 00:16:02,769
larger facility you know we can focus

381
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:04,810
more on it but does the seasonality work

382
00:16:02,769 --> 00:16:07,539
from a marketing standpoint where it's

383
00:16:04,809 --> 00:16:10,000
kind of like hey this this this strain

384
00:16:07,539 --> 00:16:11,860
dropped in this shot or in all the shops

385
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,659
and get it now because it won't be

386
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:17,589
around for long and people come running

387
00:16:13,659 --> 00:16:19,838
in because they know that they won't be

388
00:16:17,589 --> 00:16:21,550
able to get it in a month it's really

389
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:23,529
more you know and when you flash my

390
00:16:21,549 --> 00:16:24,909
social media with my small number on it

391
00:16:23,528 --> 00:16:27,299
the one thing with that is that

392
00:16:24,909 --> 00:16:30,789
everybody on that are very dedicated

393
00:16:27,299 --> 00:16:33,309
legacy fans and you know I can be very

394
00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:35,110
accessible with 1600 people when they

395
00:16:33,309 --> 00:16:37,000
message me I talked to him back we

396
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:43,720
totally will geek out on genetics all

397
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:46,600
the time on there but it's more like it

398
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:48,160
it's really more the rare ones like the

399
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:50,170
look like the legacy glue which is you

400
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:52,120
know gorilla glue for which can't call

401
00:16:50,169 --> 00:16:53,649
it that people will hit me up saying

402
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,339
when is this coming out and miss this

403
00:16:53,649 --> 00:16:56,440
strain

404
00:16:54,339 --> 00:16:58,420
but gorilla glue is still prevalent

405
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:59,949
enough that you can't you can't run it

406
00:16:58,419 --> 00:17:02,948
that much he just has trouble moving

407
00:16:59,948 --> 00:17:04,990
because it's so flooded so it's more

408
00:17:02,948 --> 00:17:06,938
people will hit me up say when is this

409
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:09,250
coming out when is this coming out or

410
00:17:06,939 --> 00:17:10,900
you know and it's more kind of the

411
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:14,019
demand picks up like that and of course

412
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:15,339
the second the second I stopped running

413
00:17:14,019 --> 00:17:17,889
something for a bit then everybody

414
00:17:15,338 --> 00:17:21,039
everybody hits me up for is the nature

415
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:21,280
of the beast that's a good problem to

416
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:25,178
have

417
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:27,428
alright so on an annual basis kind of

418
00:17:25,179 --> 00:17:29,500
what's your capacity for like how many

419
00:17:27,429 --> 00:17:32,110
pounds of flour are you producing per

420
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:34,380
year how many turns are you doing per

421
00:17:32,109 --> 00:17:34,379
year

422
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:42,850
this year we're on track to do right

423
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:46,250
around 300 pounds okay and and then are

424
00:17:42,849 --> 00:17:50,149
you sending kind of biomass

425
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:52,279
for extraction like are you is the whole

426
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:57,380
animal being eat killed and eaten and

427
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:59,509
used and or using it all yourself we use

428
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:01,730
it all ourselves views all of the animal

429
00:17:59,509 --> 00:18:05,150
and funny you said that these are our

430
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:06,710
pre roles that we are working on they go

431
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:09,500
and they go into these nice little

432
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:12,380
pre-roll boxes these are our small nugs

433
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:14,450
and our sugar leaf part of the

434
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:16,250
advantages of having a small crew is

435
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:18,580
that my processing team does everything

436
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:20,869
from harvest all the way to pre rolls

437
00:18:18,579 --> 00:18:23,960
they do you know they do the packaging

438
00:18:20,869 --> 00:18:25,459
they do the trimming so our process you

439
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:28,700
know as it comes down you have your big

440
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:30,288
families that don't have THC on it those

441
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:32,630
all get trimmed off for the drying

442
00:18:30,288 --> 00:18:34,279
process when the trimming happens the

443
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:37,010
sugar leaf that comes and gets combined

444
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:38,569
with the small bugs our sugar leaf when

445
00:18:37,009 --> 00:18:41,450
we used to get us out to processing

446
00:18:38,569 --> 00:18:44,019
tested already around 18% so it's very

447
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:47,179
good viable material along with our

448
00:18:44,019 --> 00:18:49,369
small buds with your tests around 22% so

449
00:18:47,179 --> 00:18:52,669
we blend those together our pre rolls

450
00:18:49,369 --> 00:18:54,949
tend to average about 20% THD and we use

451
00:18:52,669 --> 00:18:56,570
everything so we're not sending any

452
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:59,659
biomass out because the prices on

453
00:18:56,569 --> 00:19:01,038
biomass are pretty tough you know and we

454
00:18:59,659 --> 00:19:03,770
kind of came to this about four years

455
00:19:01,038 --> 00:19:06,429
ago when the prices on biomass was at

456
00:19:03,769 --> 00:19:09,619
probably the lowest has been which was

457
00:19:06,429 --> 00:19:12,350
150 a pound and I'm looking at my really

458
00:19:09,619 --> 00:19:15,619
nice indoor grown with lots of terpenes

459
00:19:12,349 --> 00:19:17,719
and a great aroma to it and 150 a pound

460
00:19:15,619 --> 00:19:19,189
and I just felt insulted by it and so I

461
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:21,558
was thinking what do I do with it you

462
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:24,080
know so we started working to create pre

463
00:19:21,558 --> 00:19:26,298
rolls and that's another thing is to say

464
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:29,240
no so aside from our 300 pounds we

465
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:32,779
generate about 120 pounds of material

466
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:35,599
that goes into pre rolls as well are you

467
00:19:32,779 --> 00:19:39,168
doing any kind of ice water hash or

468
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:42,230
anything like that or I don't we don't

469
00:19:39,169 --> 00:19:44,750
you know we are strictly a cultivator so

470
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:46,730
we are allowed to do pre rolls and flour

471
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:48,109
we're not allowed to do any extractions

472
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:50,269
with our permit so I would have to

473
00:19:48,109 --> 00:19:52,609
contract that out and then I'm competing

474
00:19:50,269 --> 00:19:54,200
with the biomass market and they look at

475
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:57,648
a pound of my stuff like I looked at

476
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:59,960
account of outdoor stuff if there

477
00:19:57,648 --> 00:20:02,359
weren't that regulatory issue

478
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:05,240
would you have a washing machine on site

479
00:20:02,359 --> 00:20:07,219
like if you could do it tomorrow if the

480
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:09,079
regular just wave the magic wand what

481
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:11,029
would you start doing that maybe do like

482
00:20:09,079 --> 00:20:15,679
hash and fuse pre-rolls or something

483
00:20:11,029 --> 00:20:20,480
like that I I used to do this back in

484
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:22,700
like 2008 or 9 which you know I I used

485
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:24,650
to get into extractions and I used to

486
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:27,080
take my trim and make hash out of it and

487
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:30,170
I kind of realized quickly on that what

488
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:32,119
I love to do is grow cannabis and I knew

489
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:35,269
other people out there that love to do

490
00:20:32,119 --> 00:20:37,339
extractions and so my passion with

491
00:20:35,269 --> 00:20:41,029
extractions doesn't come anywhere near

492
00:20:37,339 --> 00:20:42,500
matching theirs and so I felt like they

493
00:20:41,029 --> 00:20:44,599
are gonna do so much better of a job

494
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:47,509
than I can I don't want to compete with

495
00:20:44,599 --> 00:20:48,949
somebody is Patti in any area they're

496
00:20:47,509 --> 00:20:51,140
passionate about because what I'm

497
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:53,420
passionate about is growing flower you

498
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:56,660
know so I thought it's just really good

499
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:58,279
to stick to what I love to do and you

500
00:20:56,660 --> 00:21:03,019
know not do something that I'm not as

501
00:20:58,279 --> 00:21:04,849
into and then the pre-rolls moving for

502
00:21:03,019 --> 00:21:06,799
two pre-rolls instead just made sense

503
00:21:04,849 --> 00:21:09,109
and I really I think it was a great

504
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:11,859
decision that we did our pre-rolls are

505
00:21:09,109 --> 00:21:14,779
they're excellent pre-rolls if you know

506
00:21:11,859 --> 00:21:17,209
and and how many are gonna be in a pack

507
00:21:14,779 --> 00:21:27,589
like what's the and then the wholesale

508
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:30,230
on that yes yes yes in a pack we do a

509
00:21:27,589 --> 00:21:32,569
half gram we do seven of them again I'm

510
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:35,120
old school or so I like everything in

511
00:21:32,569 --> 00:21:38,089
eighth so our pure old packs are 1/8

512
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:40,699
joints 7 1/2 gram joints and they tend

513
00:21:38,089 --> 00:21:43,369
to retail around forty to forty five

514
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:45,830
dollars you know it's after-tax some

515
00:21:43,369 --> 00:21:48,229
places are as low as $35 plus tax retail

516
00:21:45,829 --> 00:21:51,049
typically $40 and they're all single

517
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:53,029
strain you know we have black hay is

518
00:21:51,049 --> 00:21:54,769
pretty rolls we have sour DT rolls every

519
00:21:53,029 --> 00:21:58,609
stream we grow we also do a pre-roll

520
00:21:54,769 --> 00:22:00,139
version of it bread and then just

521
00:21:58,609 --> 00:22:03,229
quickly getting back to the question I

522
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:06,170
asked a while ago which was you know

523
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:08,240
your your your strategy for dealing you

524
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:09,769
know if you could pick 20 retailers my

525
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,299
assumption is you kind of want to pick

526
00:22:09,769 --> 00:22:13,099
them where they're close you can go

527
00:22:11,299 --> 00:22:14,869
visit that I mean obviously not during

528
00:22:13,099 --> 00:22:18,139
lockdown but you know you can do

529
00:22:14,869 --> 00:22:20,989
FaceTime and you're not out and you know

530
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:26,690
on what what's the town on the corner of

531
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:29,120
the Arizona Nevada border needles yeah

532
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:31,548
you're not like like needles isn't your

533
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:35,178
starting point with winning shops over

534
00:22:31,548 --> 00:22:37,668
right no no although I am in some shops

535
00:22:35,179 --> 00:22:39,710
in the Monterey Bay Area a good buddy of

536
00:22:37,669 --> 00:22:42,559
mine I go back with oliver summers who

537
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:45,558
has try cannabis he has a shop in San

538
00:22:42,558 --> 00:22:47,269
Jose in Castroville so you know two

539
00:22:45,558 --> 00:22:49,849
weeks ago I got in my district van I

540
00:22:47,269 --> 00:22:50,750
left a 4:30 a.m. and I made a delivery

541
00:22:49,849 --> 00:22:53,298
to Santa Cruz

542
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:55,640
I'm Angela Brady Castroville drop

543
00:22:53,298 --> 00:22:56,929
samples off at a shop in Seaside and so

544
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:59,150
I'm hoping to do a little circuit up

545
00:22:56,929 --> 00:23:01,970
there as well but as far as shop

546
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:02,990
strategy you know and this is another

547
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:05,000
one where I have the advantage of being

548
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:07,220
a small company you know other companies

549
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:10,909
like THC designed with you know they

550
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:12,919
produce a lot of flour they they they

551
00:23:10,909 --> 00:23:16,789
have to try to be in almost every shop

552
00:23:12,919 --> 00:23:18,620
so for us since we only have for example

553
00:23:16,788 --> 00:23:20,750
right now we have a capacity for 24

554
00:23:18,619 --> 00:23:22,609
shops I don't I don't really want to

555
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:24,349
pick shops next to each other I would

556
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:26,839
like to pick shops like with a bit of

557
00:23:24,349 --> 00:23:28,699
radius one I'm a personal relationship

558
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:31,129
and a customer service guy at heart

559
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:33,230
so it allows me to have this like a

560
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:35,960
loyalty relationship with somebody else

561
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:37,400
they know that the next shop down the

562
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:39,740
street isn't going to carry legacy

563
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:41,720
strains if my people want legacy strains

564
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:43,609
they have to go to that shop the other

565
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:45,740
thing it does for me is it'll help me

566
00:23:43,609 --> 00:23:48,500
avoid slotting fees if I have an

567
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:50,779
instance where which which happened to

568
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:53,179
me where a shop I had been into a long

569
00:23:50,779 --> 00:23:55,069
time hired some new buyers that came in

570
00:23:53,179 --> 00:23:56,480
they tried to beat me down on my price

571
00:23:55,069 --> 00:24:00,288
they said you're gonna drop your price

572
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:02,210
or we're not gonna carry you so I ended

573
00:24:00,288 --> 00:24:04,250
up going a block and a half down the

574
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:05,569
street to the nearest shop that carried

575
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:08,269
them where a friend of mine became the

576
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:10,579
senior buyer and I took my whole catalog

577
00:24:08,269 --> 00:24:12,859
over there they didn't want to basically

578
00:24:10,579 --> 00:24:15,408
beat me on price or charge me a slotting

579
00:24:12,859 --> 00:24:18,048
fee and and that's what it is and I

580
00:24:15,409 --> 00:24:19,640
probably had a good 30 or 40 loyal

581
00:24:18,048 --> 00:24:21,230
customers that went to that shop that

582
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:23,740
just moved a block in half down the

583
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:26,380
street and went to the new shop so to me

584
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:29,170
having that sort of like an exclusive

585
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:31,210
is what I came up with the only leverage

586
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:34,360
I'm gonna have against slotting fees you

587
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:36,299
know not I'm not gonna go to the shop as

588
00:24:34,359 --> 00:24:40,179
slotting fees because it just won't work

589
00:24:36,299 --> 00:24:43,779
so Lauren you you know Eric is a small

590
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:46,060
company and I assume you're working with

591
00:24:43,779 --> 00:24:48,940
lots of kind of mom-and-pop operations

592
00:24:46,059 --> 00:24:51,279
as well or are you seeing kind of like

593
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:54,759
what what are you seeing with your

594
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:56,680
client base in terms of the the business

595
00:24:54,759 --> 00:25:00,129
and regulatory issues they're dealing

596
00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:02,350
with as small companies so I do deal

597
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:04,510
with a lot of small companies and I

598
00:25:02,349 --> 00:25:07,419
think you know some of the points that

599
00:25:04,509 --> 00:25:09,759
Eric made are certainly true for my

600
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:13,029
clients in law as well in terms of being

601
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:15,309
able to feel a little more nimble as a

602
00:25:13,029 --> 00:25:17,740
small company versus a larger company

603
00:25:15,309 --> 00:25:19,839
that may have a lot more employees to

604
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:22,390
have to worry about or something like

605
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:25,449
that but I also find that the small

606
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:28,870
farmers are struggling a lot there are

607
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:31,000
just a lot of burdens and requirements

608
00:25:28,869 --> 00:25:34,269
both from the state and from the local

609
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:38,769
governments the taxes are really a

610
00:25:34,269 --> 00:25:41,470
problem that is brought up often and you

611
00:25:38,769 --> 00:25:43,150
know that the lack of ability to get

612
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:45,009
some of this relief right now from the

613
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:48,940
federal government that's something that

614
00:25:45,009 --> 00:25:51,039
has you know folks are hurting more so

615
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:52,779
than other businesses despite you know

616
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:54,730
uh efforts to try to make this business

617
00:25:52,779 --> 00:25:57,730
treat it just like every other business

618
00:25:54,730 --> 00:26:01,150
that's not really happening right now

619
00:25:57,730 --> 00:26:04,930
so you know just the just the onerous

620
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:06,250
rules in the regulations the fear of

621
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:08,289
really not knowing what's going to

622
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:10,269
happen next you know in terms of is this

623
00:26:08,289 --> 00:26:11,740
going to be consolidated is it not going

624
00:26:10,269 --> 00:26:15,099
to be consolidated other changes that

625
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:18,069
keep happening and and there's the cost

626
00:26:15,099 --> 00:26:22,089
the cost is getting to be it's it's a

627
00:26:18,069 --> 00:26:24,909
lot for these farmers and so whatever

628
00:26:22,089 --> 00:26:28,480
you know whatever can be done to provide

629
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:30,790
some both financial relief and and just

630
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:35,079
other regulatory relief would be in

631
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:38,289
these these businesses interests that is

632
00:26:35,079 --> 00:26:39,788
you know the issue of dealing with

633
00:26:38,289 --> 00:26:42,428
having to deal with the distributor

634
00:26:39,788 --> 00:26:44,349
for example to do the COA testing I know

635
00:26:42,429 --> 00:26:46,450
a lot of small farmers that just aren't

636
00:26:44,349 --> 00:26:48,189
able to get attribution license due to

637
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:51,009
you know the specifics of their property

638
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:53,259
or financial constraints or anything and

639
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:57,009
it does put them in a situation where a

640
00:26:53,259 --> 00:26:58,389
lot of times they have the at least it

641
00:26:57,009 --> 00:27:00,460
seemed it feels like they have less

642
00:26:58,388 --> 00:27:02,048
power in the situation than this big

643
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:06,100
distribution company they're working

644
00:27:02,048 --> 00:27:09,278
with you know and something that our

645
00:27:06,099 --> 00:27:10,569
office what we do is we try to you know

646
00:27:09,278 --> 00:27:12,519
we do a lot of education to the

647
00:27:10,569 --> 00:27:14,348
community and to our clients and you

648
00:27:12,519 --> 00:27:16,419
know we've encountered lots of

649
00:27:14,348 --> 00:27:19,928
circumstances where small farmers were

650
00:27:16,419 --> 00:27:21,840
being taken advantage of by other you

651
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:24,220
know folks in the supply chain

652
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:27,189
distributors or retailers or

653
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:29,169
what-have-you and it's you know it's the

654
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:30,669
situation where we have folks in this

655
00:27:29,169 --> 00:27:33,429
industry that are coming out of really

656
00:27:30,669 --> 00:27:35,440
the shadows where people have been you

657
00:27:33,429 --> 00:27:38,710
know growing secretively for many years

658
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:40,629
because of the law folks were told for

659
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:43,298
many years not to write things down you

660
00:27:40,628 --> 00:27:44,918
know don't put it in a contract now

661
00:27:43,298 --> 00:27:47,769
things have changed you know weigh it

662
00:27:44,919 --> 00:27:49,690
down keep accurate records do it out in

663
00:27:47,769 --> 00:27:54,038
the open it's not hiding anymore and

664
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:56,798
it's it is quite a shift in terms of how

665
00:27:54,038 --> 00:27:59,579
you're operating how your mindset is you

666
00:27:56,798 --> 00:28:02,168
know a lot of times there are folks that

667
00:27:59,579 --> 00:28:04,058
you know just weren't necessarily from a

668
00:28:02,169 --> 00:28:06,249
traditional business world and maybe

669
00:28:04,058 --> 00:28:08,048
they can't afford to hire folks that

670
00:28:06,249 --> 00:28:09,759
specialize in each of these areas so

671
00:28:08,048 --> 00:28:11,470
they are having to take a lot of that

672
00:28:09,759 --> 00:28:14,378
responsibility on for themselves so

673
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:16,839
there is just the learning curve can be

674
00:28:14,378 --> 00:28:19,538
greater for certain businesses than

675
00:28:16,839 --> 00:28:21,238
others smaller businesses but they're

676
00:28:19,538 --> 00:28:25,210
super resilient too and I'm really

677
00:28:21,239 --> 00:28:26,919
hoping that the small operators are able

678
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:29,919
to survive and they have to do things

679
00:28:26,919 --> 00:28:33,099
like you know creating a great brand

680
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:35,019
that folks really appreciate and having

681
00:28:33,098 --> 00:28:36,898
an that following it is it is hard to

682
00:28:35,019 --> 00:28:39,788
compete with these massive operations

683
00:28:36,898 --> 00:28:42,069
but it's not impossible I think I think

684
00:28:39,788 --> 00:28:44,618
branding is is critical having a great

685
00:28:42,069 --> 00:28:47,999
product is critical educating the

686
00:28:44,618 --> 00:28:51,358
community about your product about your

687
00:28:47,999 --> 00:28:54,130
practices I'm excited about the ocal

688
00:28:51,358 --> 00:28:57,309
regulations that you know comfortable

689
00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:59,050
to organic certification I have lots of

690
00:28:57,309 --> 00:29:01,299
friends and clients who'd be interested

691
00:28:59,049 --> 00:29:03,639
in getting that on their product once

692
00:29:01,299 --> 00:29:04,779
it's available because at least let

693
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:06,430
people know we're doing this as

694
00:29:04,779 --> 00:29:08,319
organically as possible even though we

695
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:11,680
can't actually use that word on it are

696
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:14,589
the rules and so you know a lot of these

697
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:16,900
same challenges have been shared and my

698
00:29:14,589 --> 00:29:19,480
law office is a small office too we're a

699
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:22,780
small business there's you know three

700
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:25,509
attorneys and some support staff and so

701
00:29:22,779 --> 00:29:27,190
I feel that we've been pretty good at

702
00:29:25,509 --> 00:29:28,930
being nimble and adjusting to the

703
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:31,450
working from home environment and things

704
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:33,490
like that you know maybe more so than

705
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:35,110
some of the bigger firms are that are

706
00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:38,440
doing lots of layoffs and whatnot right

707
00:29:35,109 --> 00:29:41,349
now so that is you know just some kind

708
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:43,660
of observations you know for all these

709
00:29:41,349 --> 00:29:45,579
businesses right now they're gonna have

710
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:49,360
to make some adjustments going forward

711
00:29:45,579 --> 00:29:51,699
and that's just whether it's cannabis or

712
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:53,859
not and so it's important that we work

713
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:58,029
together as a community to provide

714
00:29:53,859 --> 00:30:00,009
assistance to each other and I think

715
00:29:58,029 --> 00:30:02,710
it's in in terms of other small

716
00:30:00,009 --> 00:30:05,559
operators it's it's in other small

717
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:07,029
operators interest if there's if it

718
00:30:05,559 --> 00:30:09,700
doesn't just become a situation that's

719
00:30:07,029 --> 00:30:10,960
dominated by the big players right and I

720
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:13,690
think something that really makes

721
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:16,509
California's cannabis culture unique is

722
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:18,910
how many different farmers there are and

723
00:30:16,509 --> 00:30:21,250
producers and the history just like Eric

724
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:23,200
and his legacy strains there's so many I

725
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:25,599
love the name of your company there's so

726
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:28,059
many legacy operators out there that

727
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:30,669
have that have made you know the

728
00:30:28,059 --> 00:30:32,200
cannabis culture what it is today so I'm

729
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:33,910
hoping they're able to survive this I

730
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:36,190
think there's both pluses and minuses

731
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:38,320
you know I guess plus I'd be more nimble

732
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:40,180
than a bigger company but the the

733
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:42,099
negative side is a lot of times these

734
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:44,110
smaller mom-and-pop don't have access to

735
00:30:42,099 --> 00:30:46,179
the same funding that the bigger

736
00:30:44,109 --> 00:30:47,829
companies do and so that can make it a

737
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:51,730
little more challenging to pivot in

738
00:30:47,829 --> 00:30:52,829
times like this but we'll see I've got

739
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:56,529
my fingers crossed

740
00:30:52,829 --> 00:30:58,389
okay so my takeaway from what you just

741
00:30:56,529 --> 00:31:00,940
said is that I should go into a

742
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:03,880
dispensary and buy weed from an out of

743
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:06,600
state MSO multi-state operator I should

744
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:06,600
go to support them

745
00:31:07,869 --> 00:31:17,559
so just quickly two questions for both

746
00:31:12,789 --> 00:31:21,519
of you well accounts payables has come

747
00:31:17,559 --> 00:31:24,849
up kind of operator chatter and are both

748
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:28,029
have you seen obviously cash on demand

749
00:31:24,849 --> 00:31:31,719
or on delivery would be nice but that's

750
00:31:28,029 --> 00:31:34,149
not always the case or you Lauren across

751
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:35,259
your client base or you see more kind of

752
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:37,390
delinquent

753
00:31:35,259 --> 00:31:40,119
you know accounts payables and and

754
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:42,130
either farmers or distributors or brands

755
00:31:40,119 --> 00:31:43,779
or retailers being like where's well

756
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:47,410
maybe not the retailer's but where's my

757
00:31:43,779 --> 00:31:49,059
money when am I gonna get paid because

758
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:51,850
obviously that puts a crunch on a

759
00:31:49,059 --> 00:31:53,619
business when when you know someone owes

760
00:31:51,849 --> 00:31:57,969
you money and you're relying on that

761
00:31:53,619 --> 00:32:02,319
cash so that's for both of you and then

762
00:31:57,970 --> 00:32:04,269
Eric just quickly I did if you're doing

763
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:07,659
three hundred pounds a year that's about

764
00:32:04,269 --> 00:32:09,670
averaging 25 pounds per your twelve

765
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:11,290
strains right I mean obviously some of

766
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:15,070
you grow more some of you grow less but

767
00:32:11,289 --> 00:32:17,289
the the minimum size for testing is

768
00:32:15,069 --> 00:32:20,490
fifties you're just kind of sucking up

769
00:32:17,289 --> 00:32:23,500
the cost of testing small batches right

770
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:25,390
so let's let's start with the accounts

771
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:28,059
payable but and then we can get on to

772
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:30,009
the batch size Lauren what are you

773
00:32:28,059 --> 00:32:31,480
seeing with your clients or is anybody

774
00:32:30,009 --> 00:32:34,869
frustrated that people aren't paying

775
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:37,779
them yes lots of people are frustrated

776
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:40,479
there is a lot of this happening just

777
00:32:37,779 --> 00:32:44,200
like you said lots of bills going unpaid

778
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:46,990
and folks getting not what they thought

779
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:50,049
that they had agreed to and it's

780
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:51,789
definitely it is really a problem and it

781
00:32:50,049 --> 00:32:53,069
doesn't just extend to the businesses it

782
00:32:51,789 --> 00:32:55,480
extends to

783
00:32:53,069 --> 00:32:58,210
ancillary businesses and whatnot the

784
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:59,860
whole system is kind of waiting to get

785
00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:02,769
paid because they're waiting for someone

786
00:32:59,859 --> 00:33:05,789
else to pay them and it's I think it's

787
00:33:02,769 --> 00:33:07,389
pretty unsustainable I think that

788
00:33:05,789 --> 00:33:08,740
there's some structural changes

789
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:12,340
obviously they need to happen for that

790
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:15,160
to get fixed and I also think that at

791
00:33:12,339 --> 00:33:16,389
least you know for for our clients you

792
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:18,100
know it's important that when you are

793
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:18,550
entering into these agreements with

794
00:33:18,099 --> 00:33:20,829
yours

795
00:33:18,549 --> 00:33:24,069
pliers or your producers that you have

796
00:33:20,829 --> 00:33:25,720
some terms in the contract that give

797
00:33:24,069 --> 00:33:28,179
some parameters as to when payment has

798
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:32,019
to be made right and there can be a

799
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:35,259
range but it is important that you have

800
00:33:32,019 --> 00:33:37,119
a system down for when you need to get

801
00:33:35,259 --> 00:33:39,430
paid and what happens if you don't get

802
00:33:37,119 --> 00:33:41,259
paid and there's a lot of folks that are

803
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:43,920
involved in handshake deals and that

804
00:33:41,259 --> 00:33:48,180
gets pretty fuzzy in those circumstances

805
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:51,009
can you give some examples of good good

806
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:55,920
clauses you would have in that one to

807
00:33:51,009 --> 00:33:59,319
expect payment section of the agreement

808
00:33:55,920 --> 00:34:01,090
well it's going to depend right on on

809
00:33:59,319 --> 00:34:03,669
what type of contract it is whether it's

810
00:34:01,089 --> 00:34:05,619
between a cultivator and the

811
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:09,250
manufacturer if it's between a

812
00:34:05,619 --> 00:34:11,049
distributor and a retailer and it based

813
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:14,559
on the parties obviously they can change

814
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:17,050
that however if the payment isn't made a

815
00:34:14,559 --> 00:34:20,049
you know immediately right at the time

816
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:21,910
of delivery then I would say there needs

817
00:34:20,050 --> 00:34:26,530
to be some kind of metric measured in

818
00:34:21,909 --> 00:34:28,239
either days or weeks when payment has to

819
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:29,470
be made by and if it's not paid by that

820
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:31,479
date then there's gonna be some

821
00:34:29,469 --> 00:34:33,099
penalties that kick in or maybe the the

822
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:34,119
contract is gonna get rescind that's

823
00:34:33,099 --> 00:34:36,369
it's hard to say there's no

824
00:34:34,119 --> 00:34:38,469
one-size-fits-all approach but really

825
00:34:36,369 --> 00:34:42,819
the key is you have to have something in

826
00:34:38,469 --> 00:34:45,519
concrete terms of a date whether it's a

827
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:47,350
specific date or a range and if payment

828
00:34:45,519 --> 00:34:49,780
is not made then there has to be some

829
00:34:47,349 --> 00:34:51,250
consequence that happens otherwise

830
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:52,300
people are just not going to get pay and

831
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:55,389
they're gonna think they're gonna a

832
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:59,470
beluga towei with that in the the

833
00:34:55,389 --> 00:35:01,329
specific license license categories of

834
00:34:59,469 --> 00:35:04,029
operators where are you seeing the most

835
00:35:01,329 --> 00:35:06,599
uptick in delinquent payments is it

836
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:09,280
distributors to farmers is it

837
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:11,739
distributors to brands is it retailers

838
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:16,019
to distributors is it kind of work where

839
00:35:11,739 --> 00:35:16,019
are you noticing the uptick the most i

840
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:23,170
probably cultivator is not getting paid

841
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:25,030
by distributors is what I'm seeing the

842
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:28,090
most but I've seen it in a difference

843
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:31,720
you know in different circumstances got

844
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:32,450
it and Eric what's uh does anyone know

845
00:35:31,719 --> 00:35:39,019
you money right

846
00:35:32,449 --> 00:35:41,509
now yeah i I'm nothing nothing that's so

847
00:35:39,019 --> 00:35:44,449
outside of the dorm that I'm concerned

848
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:48,410
about getting paid but you know this is

849
00:35:44,449 --> 00:35:50,539
another instance where I have have the

850
00:35:48,409 --> 00:35:54,559
benefit where being a smaller company is

851
00:35:50,539 --> 00:35:56,570
good and you know funny enough Lauren is

852
00:35:54,559 --> 00:35:58,789
an attorney will hate this because I am

853
00:35:56,570 --> 00:36:01,309
totally a handshake guy because I've

854
00:35:58,789 --> 00:36:03,710
been in this forever and most most of

855
00:36:01,309 --> 00:36:06,650
the shops I'm with a lot of my known the

856
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:10,130
owners for ten plus years because back

857
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:11,300
in the mid-2000s I've protested in front

858
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:13,608
of half of their shops when they're

859
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:15,619
getting da-rae so I just have great

860
00:36:13,608 --> 00:36:18,828
personal relationships and you know as

861
00:36:15,619 --> 00:36:21,170
it's just quickly can you give a shadow

862
00:36:18,829 --> 00:36:23,570
to some of your favorite shops you want

863
00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:27,019
to give some any shop some love yeah

864
00:36:23,570 --> 00:36:30,680
yeah my alma mater where I worked for

865
00:36:27,019 --> 00:36:32,960
nine years LA PCG and you know going

866
00:36:30,679 --> 00:36:33,769
away from the handshake Showgirl Long

867
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,630
Beach

868
00:36:33,769 --> 00:36:39,380
love that shop they have a great staff

869
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:41,599
the sweet flower shops where one of my

870
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:47,150
best friends became a senior buyer there

871
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:49,849
and I love the vibe of their shops yeah

872
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:52,039
let's let's go with the old Malibu Ning

873
00:36:49,849 --> 00:36:56,900
and high tides a great shop as well they

874
00:36:52,039 --> 00:36:59,869
go way back you know and try cannabis

875
00:36:56,900 --> 00:37:00,139
see yeah every one of herb delivery as

876
00:36:59,869 --> 00:37:02,088
well

877
00:37:00,139 --> 00:37:05,838
goddess delivers I'd do a lot of

878
00:37:02,088 --> 00:37:07,279
political work without ya shout outs to

879
00:37:05,838 --> 00:37:10,578
shout outs to every shop to crazed

880
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:13,760
legacy pretty much with terms it's

881
00:37:10,579 --> 00:37:16,400
everything everything these days is net

882
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:18,230
30 you know and part of that is the

883
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:20,088
shops still have quite a bit of leverage

884
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:22,789
because every day a shop is going to

885
00:37:20,088 --> 00:37:25,489
have a ten different sales people trying

886
00:37:22,789 --> 00:37:27,769
to generate new accounts of the shop and

887
00:37:25,489 --> 00:37:30,199
so from purchasing managers standpoint

888
00:37:27,769 --> 00:37:34,639
it's just you know it's just a cattle

889
00:37:30,199 --> 00:37:36,588
call every single day and so being a

890
00:37:34,639 --> 00:37:38,629
salesperson doing cold calls and

891
00:37:36,588 --> 00:37:41,929
cannabis shops is just it's just a

892
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:42,769
really brutal occupation it's just you

893
00:37:41,929 --> 00:37:45,759
gotta be able to deal with rejection

894
00:37:42,769 --> 00:37:48,639
after rejection after rejection and

895
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:52,390
so part of part of what makes it tough

896
00:37:48,639 --> 00:37:55,269
is if your net 30 start to come late you

897
00:37:52,389 --> 00:37:57,400
know you you have to be very careful how

898
00:37:55,269 --> 00:37:59,530
much of a fuss you put out up about it

899
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:01,420
because if you start putting up too much

900
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:03,250
of a fuss about it a lot of shops are

901
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:05,260
just gonna you know they're just gonna

902
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:07,300
decide to stop carrying your product and

903
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:09,130
go with somebody else I mean it's not so

904
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:10,480
much an issue with me but I do know it's

905
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:11,980
the issue with with a lot of other

906
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:14,559
brands that just really need to be in

907
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:16,510
every shop and so when that happens as

908
00:38:14,559 --> 00:38:19,719
well you know with a lot of these big

909
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:21,550
defaults you know that I have friends

910
00:38:19,719 --> 00:38:24,879
with companies that have kind of six

911
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:27,340
six-figure bills that Road by shops that

912
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:28,630
you know I you know they're trying to

913
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:32,130
figure out if they're ever didn't get it

914
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:35,530
back and you know throwing in laughing

915
00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:38,380
is that is that one shop that owes them

916
00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:43,690
six figures or in aggregate they're owed

917
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:47,680
six figures by a bunch of shops I hate

918
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:51,880
calling anybody out so I will merely say

919
00:38:47,679 --> 00:38:55,319
that it was a large chain that offered

920
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:59,559
them stock for their consignment debt

921
00:38:55,320 --> 00:39:16,750
Wow can I say a company name and you can

922
00:38:59,559 --> 00:39:19,389
blink if I guess correctly med men the

923
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:21,760
actual mechanics of getting paid do you

924
00:39:19,389 --> 00:39:23,559
get paid directly from the retailer or

925
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:26,890
coast through the distributor so how

926
00:39:23,559 --> 00:39:29,139
exactly does that work good it goes to

927
00:39:26,889 --> 00:39:32,109
the distributors so I don't actually get

928
00:39:29,139 --> 00:39:34,269
paid if I did get paid I would be on the

929
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:36,340
hook for paying tax on the excise tax

930
00:39:34,269 --> 00:39:37,539
which is on hold another thing

931
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:41,050
distributors have to go through but no

932
00:39:37,539 --> 00:39:42,670
it goes to my distributor dn8 event do

933
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:44,860
you have a single distributor or a

934
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:46,809
couple distributors I have a single

935
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:50,910
distributor I'm distributed through the

936
00:39:46,809 --> 00:39:50,909
same company that distributes tht design

937
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:59,599
okay and what company is that they are

938
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:03,009
13:46 la LLC

939
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:07,548
but yeah that's that's a company that

940
00:40:03,009 --> 00:40:09,949
distributes THC design you know uh I go

941
00:40:07,548 --> 00:40:11,719
way back the owners of THC designs are

942
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:13,278
really good friends of mine we've been

943
00:40:11,719 --> 00:40:16,099
doing political work together for six

944
00:40:13,278 --> 00:40:18,798
years you know and that's the benefit is

945
00:40:16,099 --> 00:40:20,630
you know and another thing like Lauren

946
00:40:18,798 --> 00:40:22,400
was saying with small businesses one of

947
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:25,160
the things we have with small businesses

948
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:26,690
I know TC designs is seems like a big

949
00:40:25,159 --> 00:40:28,728
business but I mean it's they're they're

950
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:31,249
a mom-and-pop - they started they

951
00:40:28,728 --> 00:40:34,129
started from absolutely nothing and they

952
00:40:31,248 --> 00:40:36,618
grew themselves self-funded to what they

953
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:38,269
are today you know so they're not like

954
00:40:36,619 --> 00:40:39,920
outside money they're not a Canadian

955
00:40:38,268 --> 00:40:43,189
fund company or anything like that

956
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:45,588
they're a independent company and so one

957
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:48,318
of the advantages I think that a lot of

958
00:40:45,588 --> 00:40:49,940
independent companies have more so is

959
00:40:48,318 --> 00:40:51,708
that we're really plugged into the

960
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:54,469
cannabis community and I think the

961
00:40:51,708 --> 00:40:56,719
cannabis community does treat their own

962
00:40:54,469 --> 00:41:01,269
much differently because we've always

963
00:40:56,719 --> 00:41:04,309
kind of been on a bit of a you know

964
00:41:01,268 --> 00:41:05,808
countercultural group and so I think we

965
00:41:04,309 --> 00:41:07,729
kind of stick together because we all

966
00:41:05,809 --> 00:41:10,339
have this counterculture nature to it

967
00:41:07,728 --> 00:41:11,689
and so I think when people who don't

968
00:41:10,338 --> 00:41:15,139
necessarily share those same

969
00:41:11,690 --> 00:41:16,670
counterculture ideas come into it you

970
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:18,528
know we kind of can spot them and I

971
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:20,719
think a lot of the small the small

972
00:41:18,528 --> 00:41:23,208
operators here because we love cannabis

973
00:41:20,719 --> 00:41:24,829
and we love the scene and we love the

974
00:41:23,208 --> 00:41:27,889
industry and people who are into it and

975
00:41:24,829 --> 00:41:30,619
so I think we kind of just naturally

976
00:41:27,889 --> 00:41:31,940
bond together as kindred spirits and

977
00:41:30,619 --> 00:41:33,548
this so I think the way we relate to

978
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:36,259
each other is much different than

979
00:41:33,548 --> 00:41:39,170
relating to people coming in from Wall

980
00:41:36,259 --> 00:41:40,929
Street or anywhere else you know anybody

981
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:43,190
wants into a great I don't mean to be

982
00:41:40,929 --> 00:41:45,588
disparaging people coming in from Wall

983
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:47,568
Street or a comedian fun but you know

984
00:41:45,588 --> 00:41:49,369
some of the some of them remind me of

985
00:41:47,568 --> 00:41:51,139
people who used to make fun of me and my

986
00:41:49,369 --> 00:41:53,420
friends for smoking weed at high school

987
00:41:51,139 --> 00:41:55,338
you know and it's and now the here they

988
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:57,588
are you know like you know these that

989
00:41:55,338 --> 00:41:59,719
cause losers and now they're running

990
00:41:57,588 --> 00:42:04,759
companies in our space and someone's

991
00:41:59,719 --> 00:42:08,269
like okay so what what are you doing

992
00:42:04,759 --> 00:42:11,358
with the rest and up-and-coming retail

993
00:42:08,268 --> 00:42:13,379
brands like High Times which obviously

994
00:42:11,358 --> 00:42:16,860
is an old school like

995
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:18,390
legacy brand but is now also big

996
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:22,370
corporate player are you gonna have a

997
00:42:18,389 --> 00:42:26,159
fuzzy relationship with those retailers

998
00:42:22,369 --> 00:42:28,139
no I mean you know again I'm a customer

999
00:42:26,159 --> 00:42:30,989
service person and one thing you do in

1000
00:42:28,139 --> 00:42:33,179
customer service is you never talk

1001
00:42:30,989 --> 00:42:34,949
poorly about your customer and these

1002
00:42:33,179 --> 00:42:40,529
shops are my customers if it's run by

1003
00:42:34,949 --> 00:42:44,579
high times if you know if let's I don't

1004
00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:46,920
know but let's say Dick Cheney decides

1005
00:42:44,579 --> 00:42:48,989
to buy some cannabis shops or no let's

1006
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:51,150
say John Bainer because he invested in

1007
00:42:48,989 --> 00:42:53,129
the space already if they're a customer

1008
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:54,990
they're gonna be a paying customer it

1009
00:42:53,130 --> 00:42:57,000
really does you no good to disparage

1010
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:59,459
them or talk poorly about them you know

1011
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:02,130
even the larger companies who you know

1012
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:04,710
we may or may not have alluded to before

1013
00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:06,840
you know that a lot of them have been

1014
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:08,760
customers of mine in the past and they

1015
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:09,750
have great people working there and you

1016
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:11,910
know when you're looking at the ground

1017
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:12,989
floor no matter who owns a company when

1018
00:43:11,909 --> 00:43:14,789
you go into a shop you deal with the

1019
00:43:12,989 --> 00:43:16,649
blood tenders those are the same

1020
00:43:14,789 --> 00:43:19,409
cannabis people that we've always had

1021
00:43:16,650 --> 00:43:21,450
you know so as far as as far as for

1022
00:43:19,409 --> 00:43:23,730
myself like I would love every single

1023
00:43:21,449 --> 00:43:26,309
cannabis shop no matter who owns it to

1024
00:43:23,730 --> 00:43:28,019
take a look at my brand and consider

1025
00:43:26,309 --> 00:43:30,119
carrying it like I would hate for

1026
00:43:28,019 --> 00:43:32,969
somebody to not like my brand because of

1027
00:43:30,119 --> 00:43:34,769
some egotistical reason or political

1028
00:43:32,969 --> 00:43:37,049
reason or anything like that you know

1029
00:43:34,769 --> 00:43:38,610
it's it's just good to value you have to

1030
00:43:37,050 --> 00:43:40,260
value your customers no matter who they

1031
00:43:38,610 --> 00:43:43,110
are or else you're not going to have a

1032
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:45,480
business you mentioned kind of getting

1033
00:43:43,110 --> 00:43:47,400
investment so you haven't taken on any

1034
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:49,320
outside funding beyond either yourself

1035
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:53,460
or maybe even just some family or

1036
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:56,100
friends correct yeah I have a partner

1037
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:58,139
who I started with back in 2014 that you

1038
00:43:56,099 --> 00:44:00,000
know we working our first space but yeah

1039
00:43:58,139 --> 00:44:02,460
I mean short of that and that's just an

1040
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,199
independent one and a lot of it was my

1041
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:06,840
savings that I built up I started

1042
00:44:04,199 --> 00:44:08,549
growing in 2006 I grew in a spare

1043
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:11,340
bedroom while I worked in the dispensary

1044
00:44:08,550 --> 00:44:13,650
and then I had a buddy who moved to

1045
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:15,570
Colorado from a loft downtown I took

1046
00:44:13,650 --> 00:44:17,250
over that and then I took over a garage

1047
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:19,470
and Sherman oh so at one point I had

1048
00:44:17,250 --> 00:44:23,670
three residential cultivations going on

1049
00:44:19,469 --> 00:44:25,949
in at about 2013 I was ready to jump up

1050
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:26,588
to industrial space and so I did not

1051
00:44:25,949 --> 00:44:31,389
want

1052
00:44:26,588 --> 00:44:34,239
no spots and yeah but otherwise so far

1053
00:44:31,389 --> 00:44:37,538
we've taken on no no investing we've

1054
00:44:34,239 --> 00:44:39,969
just bootstrapped it got it so getting

1055
00:44:37,539 --> 00:44:42,579
back to the question I had thrown out

1056
00:44:39,969 --> 00:44:46,059
there before about you know 300 pounds a

1057
00:44:42,579 --> 00:44:50,680
year 12 cultivars which breaks down to

1058
00:44:46,059 --> 00:44:52,900
about 25 pounds per cultivar which means

1059
00:44:50,679 --> 00:44:55,989
that you're you're not because I know a

1060
00:44:52,900 --> 00:45:00,039
lot of people who you know you'd love to

1061
00:44:55,989 --> 00:45:02,949
grow something random in a small batch

1062
00:45:00,039 --> 00:45:05,289
and get it out there but then you're

1063
00:45:02,949 --> 00:45:06,968
hammered with testing fees and so unless

1064
00:45:05,289 --> 00:45:08,650
you're growing at least 50 pounds in

1065
00:45:06,969 --> 00:45:12,729
that it doesn't make sense but you're

1066
00:45:08,650 --> 00:45:15,910
you're sending 25 pound or even maybe 15

1067
00:45:12,728 --> 00:45:17,528
pound batches out to get tested and and

1068
00:45:15,909 --> 00:45:23,978
what what are you paying for a test what

1069
00:45:17,528 --> 00:45:26,739
lab do you use well my so um my

1070
00:45:23,978 --> 00:45:28,268
distributor handle handles all the

1071
00:45:26,739 --> 00:45:30,940
testing and since they're such a

1072
00:45:28,268 --> 00:45:34,568
high-volume distributor we do get we do

1073
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:37,539
get pretty pretty good prices on it but

1074
00:45:34,568 --> 00:45:39,759
um our average batch size tent we tend

1075
00:45:37,539 --> 00:45:42,099
to do split room so yeah we we do

1076
00:45:39,759 --> 00:45:45,068
batches of like 12 pounds at a time

1077
00:45:42,099 --> 00:45:48,400
which is definitely brutal it really it

1078
00:45:45,068 --> 00:45:50,768
really cuts into our cuts into our

1079
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:52,749
margins in case some of our strains will

1080
00:45:50,768 --> 00:45:55,179
do full rooms up and then we'll end up

1081
00:45:52,748 --> 00:45:58,419
with about 20 pounds of it which is much

1082
00:45:55,179 --> 00:46:00,818
nicer but yeah lab lab testing eats up a

1083
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:02,769
big chunk of money from us you know just

1084
00:46:00,818 --> 00:46:04,690
again because we do a smaller thing and

1085
00:46:02,768 --> 00:46:07,508
part of the reason for that as well as

1086
00:46:04,690 --> 00:46:11,019
because I do the sales so if I'm growing

1087
00:46:07,509 --> 00:46:14,170
in my whole facility to two types that

1088
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:17,318
means that I'm going to have to have 40

1089
00:46:14,170 --> 00:46:19,930
accounts you know if I grow five types

1090
00:46:17,318 --> 00:46:22,960
then I can drop that down down

1091
00:46:19,929 --> 00:46:25,268
considerably because instead of taking a

1092
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:27,639
half pound of time at my one variety

1093
00:46:25,268 --> 00:46:29,949
they'll take a half pound of four

1094
00:46:27,639 --> 00:46:32,469
different varieties and so it's just

1095
00:46:29,949 --> 00:46:35,768
less it's less sales work for me to do I

1096
00:46:32,469 --> 00:46:37,568
think if I really only grew one type and

1097
00:46:35,768 --> 00:46:40,209
I grew larger batches I would probably

1098
00:46:37,568 --> 00:46:43,088
have to spend that money on one or two

1099
00:46:40,210 --> 00:46:48,699
our outside salespeople to reach the

1100
00:46:43,088 --> 00:46:52,960
extra shops that I could get got it deal

1101
00:46:48,699 --> 00:46:54,399
any of your of your product no no we

1102
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:56,050
don't hole so everything is everything

1103
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:59,710
is packaged in Branham you don't do any

1104
00:46:56,050 --> 00:47:02,500
wholesaling or white labeling because we

1105
00:46:59,710 --> 00:47:06,300
had just heard recently from actually it

1106
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:10,119
was Greg who said that he was actually

1107
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:13,260
making more money wholesaling than

1108
00:47:10,119 --> 00:47:16,180
putting his product on his own shells

1109
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:20,140
that that was the strength of the bulk

1110
00:47:16,179 --> 00:47:25,539
market for him it was the lunacy of the

1111
00:47:20,139 --> 00:47:29,949
of the tax and all this to create his

1112
00:47:25,539 --> 00:47:34,019
own put it in his own Brandon yeah yeah

1113
00:47:29,949 --> 00:47:37,659
the the the bulk the bulk market is

1114
00:47:34,019 --> 00:47:39,759
really has really strong prices right

1115
00:47:37,659 --> 00:47:41,559
now I'm not really sure why or what it

1116
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:43,510
is about this but over the last few

1117
00:47:41,559 --> 00:47:48,279
months definitely the bulk prices have

1118
00:47:43,510 --> 00:47:50,410
really have really been strong and this

1119
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:52,359
this would be a whole other issue for

1120
00:47:50,409 --> 00:47:54,190
somebody else other than me to tell you

1121
00:47:52,358 --> 00:47:57,338
why but but it's definitely is

1122
00:47:54,190 --> 00:48:01,210
definitely happening but does that play

1123
00:47:57,338 --> 00:48:05,650
a role in in your future plans at all

1124
00:48:01,210 --> 00:48:08,050
like if you were to expand I mean how do

1125
00:48:05,650 --> 00:48:11,800
you see that part of my if it continues

1126
00:48:08,050 --> 00:48:14,200
to be a strong market he's he's Greg

1127
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:16,359
Prince's is selling to a very well known

1128
00:48:14,199 --> 00:48:19,358
brand which I'm not going to say really

1129
00:48:16,358 --> 00:48:20,739
well-known and for a consumer that's

1130
00:48:19,358 --> 00:48:22,119
just you know for someone like me

1131
00:48:20,739 --> 00:48:24,368
walking in that shop it's kind of

1132
00:48:22,119 --> 00:48:28,420
telling me I don't know necessarily what

1133
00:48:24,369 --> 00:48:29,890
I'm getting but but that aside there's

1134
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:31,990
no reason to necessarily believe that

1135
00:48:29,889 --> 00:48:34,389
the strength of that bulk market is

1136
00:48:31,989 --> 00:48:41,199
going to necessarily go away because

1137
00:48:34,389 --> 00:48:44,858
demand seems to be there yeah I'm pretty

1138
00:48:41,199 --> 00:48:47,500
torn on this I do think that the most

1139
00:48:44,858 --> 00:48:50,460
successful operating model would involve

1140
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:52,539
you selling 100% of what you produce

1141
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:55,208
under your own brand

1142
00:48:52,539 --> 00:48:57,910
because otherwise if I'm if I'm selling

1143
00:48:55,208 --> 00:49:00,399
bulk to somebody they're paying bulk for

1144
00:48:57,909 --> 00:49:01,989
that and then they're doing additional

1145
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:04,479
things on top of that which is going to

1146
00:49:01,989 --> 00:49:08,188
increase their cost you know and and

1147
00:49:04,478 --> 00:49:10,088
also as more operators and more

1148
00:49:08,188 --> 00:49:12,788
facilities come online I think

1149
00:49:10,088 --> 00:49:14,679
especially larger ones you're gonna find

1150
00:49:12,789 --> 00:49:16,689
that the bulk market is one that's going

1151
00:49:14,679 --> 00:49:19,630
to be much more subject to general

1152
00:49:16,688 --> 00:49:21,759
commodity prices you know like with it

1153
00:49:19,630 --> 00:49:24,400
with everything looking at this you have

1154
00:49:21,759 --> 00:49:25,869
you know your your crude oil price and

1155
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:27,489
even you hear of your gasoline price

1156
00:49:25,869 --> 00:49:30,579
which is your finished refined product

1157
00:49:27,489 --> 00:49:32,559
and both of these markets are impacted

1158
00:49:30,579 --> 00:49:34,778
by each other but they're also both a

1159
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:36,819
little bit separate you know your

1160
00:49:34,778 --> 00:49:39,068
refining capacity is gonna dictate your

1161
00:49:36,818 --> 00:49:40,298
gas price just like the bulk price of

1162
00:49:39,068 --> 00:49:43,869
crude oil is you know they're not

1163
00:49:40,298 --> 00:49:45,788
necessarily in a vacuum and so having

1164
00:49:43,869 --> 00:49:48,369
everything going out and branded you can

1165
00:49:45,789 --> 00:49:50,499
control what you're getting but if if

1166
00:49:48,369 --> 00:49:51,818
50% of your inventory you have to bulk

1167
00:49:50,498 --> 00:49:54,818
price if there's a glut in the market

1168
00:49:51,818 --> 00:49:57,909
and the bulk price drops 1,100 a pound

1169
00:49:54,818 --> 00:50:00,429
all of a sudden all of a sudden half of

1170
00:49:57,909 --> 00:50:02,979
what you're selling you're you're

1171
00:50:00,429 --> 00:50:05,318
probably losing money at or you're not

1172
00:50:02,978 --> 00:50:07,568
making anything if the prices say strong

1173
00:50:05,318 --> 00:50:10,538
with 18 to 2,000 which is where they are

1174
00:50:07,568 --> 00:50:14,469
now then then you're doing fine but you

1175
00:50:10,539 --> 00:50:16,089
know with anything else if if there's if

1176
00:50:14,469 --> 00:50:18,458
there's a space for somebody to come in

1177
00:50:16,088 --> 00:50:20,469
and occupy because you know if it's

1178
00:50:18,458 --> 00:50:21,759
costing everybody a thousand bucks to

1179
00:50:20,469 --> 00:50:24,400
grow a pound but everybody is getting

1180
00:50:21,759 --> 00:50:25,900
1,800 on it without markup more people

1181
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:27,729
are gonna fill that space and produce

1182
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:30,068
those pounds until all of a sudden you

1183
00:50:27,728 --> 00:50:31,538
have over capacity and then the prices

1184
00:50:30,068 --> 00:50:33,188
are going to crash and then when they

1185
00:50:31,539 --> 00:50:35,319
hit 11 the inefficient people are gonna

1186
00:50:33,188 --> 00:50:37,389
pack up shop and it's gonna be cyclical

1187
00:50:35,318 --> 00:50:38,048
but if you're selling your product to

1188
00:50:37,389 --> 00:50:39,788
consumers

1189
00:50:38,048 --> 00:50:41,708
you're kind of immune from all that

1190
00:50:39,789 --> 00:50:44,640
because you're just getting your

1191
00:50:41,708 --> 00:50:48,219
wholesale price per package date so

1192
00:50:44,639 --> 00:50:50,739
that's the place to be I think relying

1193
00:50:48,219 --> 00:50:52,809
on bulk whole sales as a business model

1194
00:50:50,739 --> 00:50:55,269
is playing with fire or a hot potato

1195
00:50:52,809 --> 00:50:56,739
it's gonna work out sometimes but

1196
00:50:55,268 --> 00:50:59,018
there's gonna be times it doesn't work

1197
00:50:56,739 --> 00:51:01,028
and you're gonna have to figure out how

1198
00:50:59,018 --> 00:51:02,798
to adjust to that but I think most

1199
00:51:01,028 --> 00:51:04,659
people relying on bulk are trying to

1200
00:51:02,798 --> 00:51:06,070
figure out how to get a larger

1201
00:51:04,659 --> 00:51:07,930
percentage into retail

1202
00:51:06,070 --> 00:51:09,280
as fast as they can which may be that's

1203
00:51:07,929 --> 00:51:11,949
part of why we're seeing some downward

1204
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:16,300
pressure on wholesale prices in packaged

1205
00:51:11,949 --> 00:51:18,369
goods versus bullet yeah I was just

1206
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:21,670
gonna ask you what your projections are

1207
00:51:18,369 --> 00:51:25,150
for kind of let's say end of 2020 spot

1208
00:51:21,670 --> 00:51:28,329
market pricing for you know per pound on

1209
00:51:25,150 --> 00:51:29,800
both the regulated market and then what

1210
00:51:28,329 --> 00:51:33,250
are your friends in the traditional

1211
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:37,800
market telling you our is life is it la

1212
00:51:33,250 --> 00:51:40,239
dolce vita is life good right now or I

1213
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:43,090
mean I've been in this room I don't have

1214
00:51:40,239 --> 00:51:46,899
a lot of friends and uh outside in the

1215
00:51:43,090 --> 00:51:49,000
traditional market anymore you know your

1216
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:50,889
friends are all masochists they all like

1217
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:54,429
the pain of getting into the regulated

1218
00:51:50,889 --> 00:51:56,289
market you know I guess the people the

1219
00:51:54,429 --> 00:51:58,059
traditional market are too busy going on

1220
00:51:56,289 --> 00:52:00,400
exotic vacations around the world

1221
00:51:58,059 --> 00:52:02,679
whereas I'm just eating ramen and

1222
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:05,380
bitching about it with my regulated

1223
00:52:02,679 --> 00:52:07,980
market friends I don't know if they're

1224
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:10,269
doing that now

1225
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:14,019
so do you think in the regulated market

1226
00:52:10,269 --> 00:52:16,659
the per pound prices you know obviously

1227
00:52:14,019 --> 00:52:19,119
you have like top shelf mids whatever

1228
00:52:16,659 --> 00:52:21,909
but do you think on average prices are

1229
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:24,489
gonna go up at the end of the year do

1230
00:52:21,909 --> 00:52:26,349
you see more farms coming online and

1231
00:52:24,489 --> 00:52:28,929
prices going down by the end of the year

1232
00:52:26,349 --> 00:52:32,799
the prices are so strong right now on

1233
00:52:28,929 --> 00:52:35,230
wholesale I I don't see how it could

1234
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:38,289
last till the end of the year I mean if

1235
00:52:35,230 --> 00:52:40,570
it does I'll be mildly surprised I guess

1236
00:52:38,289 --> 00:52:42,429
I won't be totally shocked by it but I

1237
00:52:40,570 --> 00:52:45,430
mean the prices are really really strong

1238
00:52:42,429 --> 00:52:48,369
right now but might like it give me

1239
00:52:45,429 --> 00:52:52,149
ballpark pricing that you're seeing four

1240
00:52:48,369 --> 00:52:56,079
pounds of you know different caliber

1241
00:52:52,150 --> 00:52:58,660
flower of a top shelf and I know might

1242
00:52:56,079 --> 00:53:01,960
my knowledge is endure the greenhouse

1243
00:52:58,659 --> 00:53:03,969
stuff you know I so so let's do end or

1244
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:06,220
top shelf indoor what's the per prompt

1245
00:53:03,969 --> 00:53:10,959
rice I hope I have multiple friends with

1246
00:53:06,219 --> 00:53:13,989
brands yeah about $2,000 cod4 bulk

1247
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:16,659
pounds right now of good quality stuff

1248
00:53:13,989 --> 00:53:19,858
you know good testing you know we're

1249
00:53:16,659 --> 00:53:22,980
talking like 25% plus TAC like your top

1250
00:53:19,858 --> 00:53:25,818
Balt is going for mm sometimes 2,100

1251
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:29,699
pounds co d I have even heard of

1252
00:53:25,818 --> 00:53:31,588
distributors prepaying for future

1253
00:53:29,699 --> 00:53:33,210
harvests that haven't even come down yet

1254
00:53:31,588 --> 00:53:35,788
that's how hot the market is right now

1255
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:39,449
and I've never heard that and what was

1256
00:53:35,789 --> 00:53:42,079
it a year ago that same $2,000 pound was

1257
00:53:39,449 --> 00:53:46,348
a 14 okay

1258
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:51,239
14 and growers calling me asking if I

1259
00:53:46,349 --> 00:53:53,519
knew buyers now it's it's a broker's

1260
00:53:51,239 --> 00:53:56,088
calling me asking me if I can track down

1261
00:53:53,518 --> 00:53:59,159
any any pounds out there you know and

1262
00:53:56,088 --> 00:54:01,798
send and yeah and in deaths this

1263
00:53:59,159 --> 00:54:04,139
happened about three weeks ago a month

1264
00:54:01,798 --> 00:54:05,338
ago I had I had somebody call me who I

1265
00:54:04,139 --> 00:54:06,618
used to know somebody who I never

1266
00:54:05,338 --> 00:54:09,599
thought I would hear from again

1267
00:54:06,619 --> 00:54:12,019
calling me asking if I can if I can find

1268
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:14,940
them any farms that had any top shelf it

1269
00:54:12,018 --> 00:54:16,709
in Flour and that's that's when I was

1270
00:54:14,940 --> 00:54:18,630
like what is going on here you know and

1271
00:54:16,710 --> 00:54:20,159
I still really don't know but I just

1272
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:22,710
know the markets really hot right now

1273
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:24,929
I'm not on the bulk wholesale and I just

1274
00:54:22,710 --> 00:54:28,798
don't know I don't know how it can keep

1275
00:54:24,929 --> 00:54:32,788
up like this but right so for both of

1276
00:54:28,798 --> 00:54:34,829
you and let's start with you Lauren I I

1277
00:54:32,789 --> 00:54:39,028
thought it'd be interesting as we bring

1278
00:54:34,829 --> 00:54:42,920
people on if people can give an example

1279
00:54:39,028 --> 00:54:46,730
of a situation where you had to educate

1280
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:51,358
either a local or state regulator

1281
00:54:46,730 --> 00:54:53,400
politician on some topic or you you had

1282
00:54:51,358 --> 00:54:55,498
a friend or someone who's you know

1283
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:57,210
Lauren you're a lawyer so you you heard

1284
00:54:55,498 --> 00:54:59,189
of it you talked to another lawyer who

1285
00:54:57,210 --> 00:55:01,199
had to educate someone on something what

1286
00:54:59,190 --> 00:55:03,179
give me an example of something where

1287
00:55:01,199 --> 00:55:05,278
you had to educate or you know someone

1288
00:55:03,179 --> 00:55:09,868
who had to educate either a local or

1289
00:55:05,278 --> 00:55:13,048
state politician regulator on some topic

1290
00:55:09,869 --> 00:55:15,690
related to cannabis so that they could

1291
00:55:13,048 --> 00:55:18,690
be sensible with their policies and

1292
00:55:15,690 --> 00:55:21,989
regulations yeah I've got a recent

1293
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:25,220
example of that talking about the

1294
00:55:21,989 --> 00:55:29,429
shelter-in-place orders that went down

1295
00:55:25,219 --> 00:55:31,528
for coronavirus in Sonoma County where

1296
00:55:29,429 --> 00:55:32,759
I'm where I live and where my office is

1297
00:55:31,528 --> 00:55:35,909
located

1298
00:55:32,759 --> 00:55:38,880
the county's original shelter-in-place

1299
00:55:35,909 --> 00:55:40,618
order when it was defining what's an

1300
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:43,709
essential business and what's not an

1301
00:55:40,619 --> 00:55:47,519
essential business the first version of

1302
00:55:43,708 --> 00:55:51,448
it said that medical cannabis operators

1303
00:55:47,518 --> 00:55:53,038
were essential but it implied that

1304
00:55:51,449 --> 00:55:55,769
anyone that didn't have a medical

1305
00:55:53,039 --> 00:56:01,049
license wasn't included and it also said

1306
00:55:55,768 --> 00:56:03,298
that effectively like testing labs were

1307
00:56:01,048 --> 00:56:05,759
not essential unless they were testing

1308
00:56:03,298 --> 00:56:08,248
cannabis that was destined for a medical

1309
00:56:05,759 --> 00:56:10,438
facility and so I read that and I was

1310
00:56:08,248 --> 00:56:12,328
like there's no way that's not how this

1311
00:56:10,438 --> 00:56:14,338
works there's you know you're when

1312
00:56:12,329 --> 00:56:16,079
you're in the lab is testing products

1313
00:56:14,338 --> 00:56:17,818
they don't always know what facility is

1314
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:19,949
going to be selling it the labs

1315
00:56:17,818 --> 00:56:22,949
themselves aren't designated as medical

1316
00:56:19,949 --> 00:56:24,929
or adult use they're also not they're

1317
00:56:22,949 --> 00:56:26,159
not really growing the plant producing

1318
00:56:24,929 --> 00:56:27,630
the plant anything they're doing

1319
00:56:26,159 --> 00:56:30,058
something that's a purely you know

1320
00:56:27,630 --> 00:56:33,239
testing health and safety you know

1321
00:56:30,059 --> 00:56:35,309
function and I had no idea why the

1322
00:56:33,239 --> 00:56:37,170
county had written their health order

1323
00:56:35,309 --> 00:56:38,670
that way and so I reached out to the

1324
00:56:37,170 --> 00:56:40,380
health department and I mean it turned

1325
00:56:38,670 --> 00:56:43,798
out that the county just had no idea how

1326
00:56:40,380 --> 00:56:45,088
cannabis testing labs worked and you

1327
00:56:43,798 --> 00:56:46,949
know I think they thought that maybe

1328
00:56:45,088 --> 00:56:49,108
they were affiliated with a dispensary

1329
00:56:46,949 --> 00:56:50,579
or something like that or that all the

1330
00:56:49,108 --> 00:56:52,259
you know products came in with a big

1331
00:56:50,579 --> 00:56:53,910
label that said this is gonna be for a

1332
00:56:52,259 --> 00:56:55,679
medical user this is not gonna be for a

1333
00:56:53,909 --> 00:56:58,379
medical user and was I explained you

1334
00:56:55,679 --> 00:56:59,999
know that's just not how it works I

1335
00:56:58,380 --> 00:57:01,259
would you know I was able to get the

1336
00:56:59,998 --> 00:57:04,228
county to revise their shelter-in-place

1337
00:57:01,259 --> 00:57:06,239
order to make it clear that all cannabis

1338
00:57:04,228 --> 00:57:07,618
testing labs in the county are essential

1339
00:57:06,239 --> 00:57:09,059
businesses and can stay open no matter

1340
00:57:07,619 --> 00:57:10,858
what they're testing and that all

1341
00:57:09,059 --> 00:57:13,259
cannabis businesses no matter whether

1342
00:57:10,858 --> 00:57:15,989
they're medical or adult use are

1343
00:57:13,259 --> 00:57:19,559
essential and can stay open because not

1344
00:57:15,989 --> 00:57:21,539
every person that uses cannabis a lot of

1345
00:57:19,559 --> 00:57:24,749
people use cannabis and what we really

1346
00:57:21,539 --> 00:57:26,579
is a medical way but don't consider

1347
00:57:24,748 --> 00:57:28,198
themselves the patient or don't have a

1348
00:57:26,579 --> 00:57:30,390
medical card and so they shouldn't be

1349
00:57:28,199 --> 00:57:32,759
excluded from you know the ability to

1350
00:57:30,389 --> 00:57:35,098
use the services and those businesses

1351
00:57:32,759 --> 00:57:36,958
that employ local people shouldn't have

1352
00:57:35,099 --> 00:57:39,359
to shut down just because the county is

1353
00:57:36,958 --> 00:57:41,219
you know misconception and so anyway I

1354
00:57:39,358 --> 00:57:43,798
talked with them about all that and I

1355
00:57:41,219 --> 00:57:45,889
was able to get them to amend the

1356
00:57:43,798 --> 00:57:47,929
shelter-in-place order so

1357
00:57:45,889 --> 00:57:49,699
but it needed education it was people

1358
00:57:47,929 --> 00:57:51,500
who are making these rules don't really

1359
00:57:49,699 --> 00:57:53,089
understand how the industry works don't

1360
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:55,670
understand the supply chain and all the

1361
00:57:53,090 --> 00:57:57,680
intricacies of it I think the whole

1362
00:57:55,670 --> 00:58:00,920
medical versus adult use designation

1363
00:57:57,679 --> 00:58:02,179
really has its hasn't it creates some

1364
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:04,400
problems like this where we're creating

1365
00:58:02,179 --> 00:58:06,349
you know two separate categories of

1366
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:07,970
buyers and don't get me wrong there are

1367
00:58:06,349 --> 00:58:10,460
some people that absolutely are medical

1368
00:58:07,969 --> 00:58:12,589
patients and they deserve to be you know

1369
00:58:10,460 --> 00:58:14,900
I think prioritized above people that

1370
00:58:12,590 --> 00:58:15,920
are just trying to get high but even the

1371
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:17,329
people that are just trying to get high

1372
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:19,519
if they're doing it because it's calming

1373
00:58:17,329 --> 00:58:21,710
them down because like for me I have

1374
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:24,019
that anxiety it helps my anxiety that's

1375
00:58:21,710 --> 00:58:26,389
a medical use I mean I might take xanax

1376
00:58:24,019 --> 00:58:28,009
for that instead and I'm not and so I

1377
00:58:26,389 --> 00:58:31,099
think we need to rethink you know what

1378
00:58:28,010 --> 00:58:35,950
we think of as medical use and just and

1379
00:58:31,099 --> 00:58:39,519
educate lawmakers about exactly that and

1380
00:58:35,949 --> 00:58:43,519
Eric do you have an example down in

1381
00:58:39,519 --> 00:58:46,300
SoCal of having to sit someone down and

1382
00:58:43,519 --> 00:58:46,300
teach them something

1383
00:58:48,559 --> 00:58:54,049
you know a lot of that was more you know

1384
00:58:52,159 --> 00:58:56,599
my 9 years behind the counter as a

1385
00:58:54,050 --> 00:58:58,400
budtender there was plenty of education

1386
00:58:56,599 --> 00:59:00,199
on that and misconception to kind of

1387
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:03,070
speak into what Lauren was talking about

1388
00:59:00,199 --> 00:59:08,000
as well like I wonder percent agree that

1389
00:59:03,070 --> 00:59:10,100
people use cannabis you know it if not

1390
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:12,320
medicinally is to improve a quality of

1391
00:59:10,099 --> 00:59:14,960
life which I would consider therapeutic

1392
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:17,990
at the very least and you know there's I

1393
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:19,670
think times where you know it's

1394
00:59:17,989 --> 00:59:21,829
important for people not to judge other

1395
00:59:19,670 --> 00:59:24,610
people and like with cannabis at the

1396
00:59:21,829 --> 00:59:27,400
shop sometimes people would come in and

1397
00:59:24,610 --> 00:59:29,930
some people were more obviously

1398
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:33,019
disability than others and this is you

1399
00:59:29,929 --> 00:59:34,909
know going back in the mid-2000s when it

1400
00:59:33,019 --> 00:59:38,090
was much more strict on the medical and

1401
00:59:34,909 --> 00:59:40,789
I remember there was a older lady in

1402
00:59:38,090 --> 00:59:42,950
line and you know she had like a walker

1403
00:59:40,789 --> 00:59:44,960
and she had a younger kid in front of

1404
00:59:42,949 --> 00:59:47,599
her you know very urban looking with

1405
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:49,220
that you know flat rim baseball cap all

1406
00:59:47,599 --> 00:59:51,889
that and telling there was a big line

1407
00:59:49,219 --> 00:59:53,689
telling him that he should let her go in

1408
00:59:51,889 --> 00:59:56,170
front of her because she was sicker than

1409
00:59:53,690 --> 00:59:58,700
he was obviously and I remember this kid

1410
00:59:56,170 --> 01:00:01,280
lifted up his shirt and he was just

1411
00:59:58,699 --> 01:00:04,339
multiple surgeries and just zippers up

1412
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:07,370
and down from everything he had and it's

1413
01:00:04,340 --> 01:00:09,500
just kind of like you can't really judge

1414
01:00:07,369 --> 01:00:10,880
somebody by looking at them as well you

1415
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:13,309
know and this is something we would deal

1416
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:15,500
with law enforcement backbends who would

1417
01:00:13,309 --> 01:00:17,150
basically say medical cannabis is a scam

1418
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:19,550
these people are just scamming it

1419
01:00:17,150 --> 01:00:21,050
they're not really sick you know and

1420
01:00:19,550 --> 01:00:22,730
they would say things like we parked

1421
01:00:21,050 --> 01:00:24,710
outside of a shop and watch people walk

1422
01:00:22,730 --> 01:00:26,690
in and now none of them looked very sick

1423
01:00:24,710 --> 01:00:28,970
and this is in West Hollywood you know

1424
01:00:26,690 --> 01:00:30,320
and my question is like how do you know

1425
01:00:28,969 --> 01:00:32,179
from looking at somebody if they're an

1426
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:34,730
AIDS patient or a cancer patient I mean

1427
01:00:32,179 --> 01:00:37,609
short of having just done chemo you know

1428
01:00:34,730 --> 01:00:40,039
so so I really think with that a lot of

1429
01:00:37,610 --> 01:00:42,289
it is you know what one of the reasons

1430
01:00:40,039 --> 01:00:44,480
people really use cannabis and I think

1431
01:00:42,289 --> 01:00:46,250
it comes down to it at the end it's

1432
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:49,519
really therapeutic and it improves the

1433
01:00:46,250 --> 01:00:52,219
quality of life and to me having

1434
01:00:49,519 --> 01:00:54,500
something chemically that can help

1435
01:00:52,219 --> 01:00:56,779
improve your quality of life as a

1436
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:58,579
medicinal use you know and I do think a

1437
01:00:56,780 --> 01:01:00,200
lot of that does get shortchanged and

1438
01:00:58,579 --> 01:01:03,259
you know I even my

1439
01:01:00,199 --> 01:01:04,969
all you know I talk I talk about to be

1440
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:06,770
about stoner culture and things like

1441
01:01:04,969 --> 01:01:09,379
that because that's there as well but

1442
01:01:06,769 --> 01:01:11,539
but I think deep down we're all using it

1443
01:01:09,380 --> 01:01:14,200
to improve our quality of life and so I

1444
01:01:11,539 --> 01:01:17,329
guess that's that's how I'd answer it

1445
01:01:14,199 --> 01:01:21,078
okay so Lauren can you talk about

1446
01:01:17,329 --> 01:01:23,960
something you guys are working on behind

1447
01:01:21,079 --> 01:01:27,410
the scenes that maybe is related to or

1448
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:31,730
requires a legislative change and then

1449
01:01:27,409 --> 01:01:36,469
oh and or something that is is more

1450
01:01:31,730 --> 01:01:41,630
regulatory like the BCC CDFA or CD pH

1451
01:01:36,469 --> 01:01:46,368
can change without requiring legislative

1452
01:01:41,630 --> 01:01:50,200
change yeah I mean at the at the state

1453
01:01:46,369 --> 01:01:52,970
level you know we have reached out

1454
01:01:50,199 --> 01:01:55,598
individually to our state lawmakers and

1455
01:01:52,969 --> 01:01:57,739
asked them to support tax relief bills

1456
01:01:55,599 --> 01:02:00,800
because that's something you know that's

1457
01:01:57,739 --> 01:02:02,479
gonna require legislative fix and so I

1458
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:05,240
do encourage everyone to keep putting

1459
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:07,760
pressure on your local state senators

1460
01:02:05,239 --> 01:02:10,459
and representatives to support cannabis

1461
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:12,950
tax relief measures just quickly on that

1462
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:16,550
front I mean what's the reception like I

1463
01:02:12,949 --> 01:02:19,789
feel like it's about as obvious as as

1464
01:02:16,550 --> 01:02:23,420
you know the the Sun rising and the East

1465
01:02:19,789 --> 01:02:26,269
that taxes are way too high does the

1466
01:02:23,420 --> 01:02:28,460
state know that like when you talk like

1467
01:02:26,269 --> 01:02:30,289
who are you talking to and are they like

1468
01:02:28,460 --> 01:02:32,420
yeah we know taxes are way too high and

1469
01:02:30,289 --> 01:02:33,920
it's crippling yeah I mean so my

1470
01:02:32,420 --> 01:02:36,559
interactions for the most part have been

1471
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:40,099
kind of with the folks that represent my

1472
01:02:36,559 --> 01:02:42,500
area who are people like Jim wood and

1473
01:02:40,099 --> 01:02:44,539
Mike McGuire folks that are super on our

1474
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:46,190
side and so they're very much aware of

1475
01:02:44,539 --> 01:02:48,679
it I know they are doing what they can

1476
01:02:46,190 --> 01:02:51,349
to lead this effort and I think you go

1477
01:02:48,679 --> 01:02:53,269
over all folks in Sacramento do realize

1478
01:02:51,349 --> 01:02:55,338
that taxes are too high I think we can't

1479
01:02:53,269 --> 01:02:57,349
look at cannabis in a in a vac you know

1480
01:02:55,338 --> 01:02:58,730
we have to realize that the state is

1481
01:02:57,349 --> 01:03:03,109
doing a lot of other things too that

1482
01:02:58,730 --> 01:03:05,240
require money and you know for which

1483
01:03:03,108 --> 01:03:07,549
these taxes are needed these and other

1484
01:03:05,239 --> 01:03:09,979
taxes and so lowering taxes is always a

1485
01:03:07,550 --> 01:03:11,780
tricky conversation because that money

1486
01:03:09,980 --> 01:03:13,159
needs to that money's being used for

1487
01:03:11,780 --> 01:03:13,790
stuff and it's gonna have to come from

1488
01:03:13,159 --> 01:03:14,960
someplace

1489
01:03:13,789 --> 01:03:17,179
else potentially if they're not getting

1490
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:19,220
it from this industry anymore

1491
01:03:17,179 --> 01:03:21,949
and I also think that given the current

1492
01:03:19,219 --> 01:03:24,049
state of the health emergency right now

1493
01:03:21,949 --> 01:03:27,019
things like requests for cannabis tax

1494
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:28,760
relief are you know coming after things

1495
01:03:27,019 --> 01:03:31,909
like you know getting an emergency

1496
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:35,450
health care and and and financial relief

1497
01:03:31,909 --> 01:03:38,359
to to businesses that got shut down but

1498
01:03:35,449 --> 01:03:42,439
I think the will is there I think that

1499
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:45,200
maybe next session I think once I'm not

1500
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:47,570
sure too sure how likely it is that

1501
01:03:45,199 --> 01:03:48,739
taxes are going to get state taxes are

1502
01:03:47,570 --> 01:03:50,900
going to get reduced during the pandemic

1503
01:03:48,739 --> 01:03:53,119
I can't predict the future maybe that

1504
01:03:50,900 --> 01:03:55,160
would be wonderful I I am I'm thinking

1505
01:03:53,119 --> 01:03:57,819
it might happen kind of once the

1506
01:03:55,159 --> 01:04:01,480
emergency has passed us a little bit

1507
01:03:57,820 --> 01:04:04,280
however like I said anything's possible

1508
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:05,449
there's a at the local level taxes are

1509
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:07,310
also big problem we haven't really

1510
01:04:05,449 --> 01:04:09,049
talked about that yet but a lot of

1511
01:04:07,309 --> 01:04:11,150
different cities and counties are also

1512
01:04:09,050 --> 01:04:13,370
adding their own taxes on top of the

1513
01:04:11,150 --> 01:04:15,700
state taxes which is where why the tax

1514
01:04:13,369 --> 01:04:18,829
they issue in general is so burdensome

1515
01:04:15,699 --> 01:04:22,939
and so that's certain local governments

1516
01:04:18,829 --> 01:04:26,179
may be more willing to alter that it is

1517
01:04:22,940 --> 01:04:31,130
Sonoma and I don't know if it's just

1518
01:04:26,179 --> 01:04:34,369
count like what's your is are you just

1519
01:04:31,130 --> 01:04:38,140
Sonoma County or their local

1520
01:04:34,369 --> 01:04:42,230
jurisdictions as well like Santa Rosa

1521
01:04:38,139 --> 01:04:43,759
that it's own yes and Rosa has its own

1522
01:04:42,230 --> 01:04:46,789
Canada's policy and their own set of

1523
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:53,390
taxes that are lower than sonoma county

1524
01:04:46,789 --> 01:04:55,340
unincorporated cannabis taxes and both

1525
01:04:53,389 --> 01:05:01,750
of those relative to other

1526
01:04:55,340 --> 01:05:01,750
municipalities are they reasonable or

1527
01:05:02,949 --> 01:05:08,509
yeah I would say that Santa Rosa

1528
01:05:06,500 --> 01:05:13,489
reasonable in Sonoma County is

1529
01:05:08,510 --> 01:05:16,520
unreasonable relative I would say Santa

1530
01:05:13,489 --> 01:05:18,679
Rosa is more reasonable than Sonoma

1531
01:05:16,519 --> 01:05:21,769
County Sonoma County their their

1532
01:05:18,679 --> 01:05:24,949
cultivation tax structure in particular

1533
01:05:21,769 --> 01:05:26,659
is is complicated and it can get very

1534
01:05:24,949 --> 01:05:27,619
expensive you know it's based on the

1535
01:05:26,659 --> 01:05:29,420
size of the

1536
01:05:27,619 --> 01:05:33,710
as well as whether it's indoor/outdoor

1537
01:05:29,420 --> 01:05:35,210
mix light and it can get to be just if

1538
01:05:33,710 --> 01:05:37,940
you you know depending on what you're

1539
01:05:35,210 --> 01:05:40,070
doing you can get very burdensome and I

1540
01:05:37,940 --> 01:05:43,849
think it is higher than others I've seen

1541
01:05:40,070 --> 01:05:45,890
lower than some others I've seen but in

1542
01:05:43,849 --> 01:05:47,719
terms of just the industry in Sonoma

1543
01:05:45,889 --> 01:05:50,179
County right now is really struggling

1544
01:05:47,719 --> 01:05:53,689
it's something that would really help is

1545
01:05:50,179 --> 01:05:55,609
is reforming the local taxes as well as

1546
01:05:53,690 --> 01:05:57,740
the local permit process here in Sonoma

1547
01:05:55,610 --> 01:05:59,630
County that is very onerous people have

1548
01:05:57,739 --> 01:06:02,659
put in applications two three years ago

1549
01:05:59,630 --> 01:06:04,250
that haven't gotten to a hearing yet and

1550
01:06:02,659 --> 01:06:05,989
have been charged more and more money

1551
01:06:04,250 --> 01:06:07,639
for the county to keep reviewing things

1552
01:06:05,989 --> 01:06:10,489
and it's been bounced around to multiple

1553
01:06:07,639 --> 01:06:12,109
reviewers and so the county has just

1554
01:06:10,489 --> 01:06:16,309
some problems with how the program is

1555
01:06:12,110 --> 01:06:18,349
working and my understanding is there

1556
01:06:16,309 --> 01:06:20,750
are some changes that are going to be

1557
01:06:18,349 --> 01:06:23,480
made hopefully in the future that would

1558
01:06:20,750 --> 01:06:25,699
may move things around a bit the goal is

1559
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:27,769
is to try to get all of cultivation

1560
01:06:25,699 --> 01:06:30,589
permitted through egg weights and

1561
01:06:27,769 --> 01:06:32,300
measures rather than the permit resource

1562
01:06:30,590 --> 01:06:34,820
management department that handles other

1563
01:06:32,300 --> 01:06:37,190
types of permits and so there is an

1564
01:06:34,820 --> 01:06:39,289
effort internally and from groups like

1565
01:06:37,190 --> 01:06:41,539
Sonoma County Growers Alliance and and

1566
01:06:39,289 --> 01:06:43,719
it's know a kind of a Business Alliance

1567
01:06:41,539 --> 01:06:47,590
of the county and some other groups to

1568
01:06:43,719 --> 01:06:50,689
change how all of that is done and

1569
01:06:47,590 --> 01:06:52,370
within the city of Santa Rosa I'm not

1570
01:06:50,690 --> 01:06:54,110
too sure if there's been any talk about

1571
01:06:52,369 --> 01:06:56,809
you know changing their process they're

1572
01:06:54,110 --> 01:06:58,160
pretty efficient within Santa Rosa and

1573
01:06:56,809 --> 01:07:00,349
they've approved a lot more cannabis

1574
01:06:58,159 --> 01:07:07,549
businesses and their taxes seem more

1575
01:07:00,349 --> 01:07:09,650
reasonable but the backlog of businesses

1576
01:07:07,550 --> 01:07:12,800
waiting for permeate away in your County

1577
01:07:09,650 --> 01:07:16,250
I don't know an exact number but there's

1578
01:07:12,800 --> 01:07:18,410
a whole lot I can get I can get that

1579
01:07:16,250 --> 01:07:20,300
information and you know distribute to

1580
01:07:18,409 --> 01:07:23,389
everyone is interested but there are a

1581
01:07:20,300 --> 01:07:27,230
lot of folks that submitted applications

1582
01:07:23,389 --> 01:07:31,250
and are waiting to hear back at least

1583
01:07:27,230 --> 01:07:33,170
probably at least 50 if not more than

1584
01:07:31,250 --> 01:07:34,730
that potentially even like a hundred

1585
01:07:33,170 --> 01:07:36,170
applications that have been filed and

1586
01:07:34,730 --> 01:07:38,690
haven't really got anywhere if not more

1587
01:07:36,170 --> 01:07:41,380
and so the county is only permitted a

1588
01:07:38,690 --> 01:07:43,450
handful of

1589
01:07:41,380 --> 01:07:45,760
you know can issue to handle handful of

1590
01:07:43,449 --> 01:07:47,980
conditional use permits for larger sized

1591
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:49,330
outdoor grows in the two or three years

1592
01:07:47,980 --> 01:07:51,369
since the program has been active

1593
01:07:49,329 --> 01:07:53,349
there's a few more smaller permits that

1594
01:07:51,369 --> 01:07:54,940
have been issued and some permits for

1595
01:07:53,349 --> 01:07:58,389
things like manufacturing and

1596
01:07:54,940 --> 01:08:00,220
distribution but what's the what's the

1597
01:07:58,389 --> 01:08:03,059
square footage of the when you say

1598
01:08:00,219 --> 01:08:07,149
larger size what how big are we talking

1599
01:08:03,059 --> 01:08:10,420
so the way it is right now if you have

1600
01:08:07,150 --> 01:08:12,309
if you're ten thousand square feet or

1601
01:08:10,420 --> 01:08:14,530
less and you're in an agriculturally

1602
01:08:12,309 --> 01:08:16,479
zoned parcel you can get permitted

1603
01:08:14,530 --> 01:08:17,949
through the AG department but everything

1604
01:08:16,479 --> 01:08:20,619
else which is ten thousand and one

1605
01:08:17,949 --> 01:08:23,590
square feet up to an acre which is the

1606
01:08:20,619 --> 01:08:25,809
current cap they have has to go through

1607
01:08:23,590 --> 01:08:27,850
PR and be the permanent resource

1608
01:08:25,810 --> 01:08:29,380
management department and they have just

1609
01:08:27,850 --> 01:08:31,930
tons of bureaucracy and they're taking

1610
01:08:29,380 --> 01:08:33,670
forever and they their fees are higher

1611
01:08:31,930 --> 01:08:35,380
their application process is more

1612
01:08:33,670 --> 01:08:37,090
onerous than the folks that have about

1613
01:08:35,380 --> 01:08:38,859
ten thousand square foot or less and are

1614
01:08:37,090 --> 01:08:42,159
in an Ag zone and can just do it through

1615
01:08:38,859 --> 01:08:43,929
the AG department and so the idea is to

1616
01:08:42,159 --> 01:08:46,659
just bring all cultivators over to that

1617
01:08:43,930 --> 01:08:49,060
Naga Department process if possible and

1618
01:08:46,659 --> 01:08:50,529
so you know the former AG commissioner

1619
01:08:49,060 --> 01:08:52,750
and the current ad commissioner are very

1620
01:08:50,529 --> 01:08:55,869
much on the industry side here locally

1621
01:08:52,750 --> 01:08:58,840
and so they have been pushing internally

1622
01:08:55,869 --> 01:09:00,609
for that to happen and so we'll see

1623
01:08:58,840 --> 01:09:02,770
we're kind of waiting right now as the

1624
01:09:00,609 --> 01:09:05,259
county deals with you know you know

1625
01:09:02,770 --> 01:09:07,330
coronavirus but I've been talking to the

1626
01:09:05,260 --> 01:09:10,420
AG commissioner and he tells me that

1627
01:09:07,329 --> 01:09:12,519
sometime this fall that is going to be

1628
01:09:10,420 --> 01:09:14,260
discussed that type of a moving of

1629
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:15,880
cultivation over to the AG department

1630
01:09:14,260 --> 01:09:19,390
and we'll see if the Board of

1631
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:21,190
Supervisors is with it yeah I think that

1632
01:09:19,390 --> 01:09:23,320
really anything that they can do to help

1633
01:09:21,189 --> 01:09:26,139
people stay in business to get more tax

1634
01:09:23,319 --> 01:09:28,000
revenue again if they were to slightly

1635
01:09:26,140 --> 01:09:29,980
reduce local taxes and make it less

1636
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:31,750
onerous to get a permit they would have

1637
01:09:29,979 --> 01:09:33,339
an increase in tax revenue because

1638
01:09:31,750 --> 01:09:35,050
there'd be more businesses that could

1639
01:09:33,340 --> 01:09:37,630
actually you know get permitted and

1640
01:09:35,050 --> 01:09:41,470
survive and operate and that's basic

1641
01:09:37,630 --> 01:09:43,000
economics exactly and is that something

1642
01:09:41,470 --> 01:09:46,630
that literally the Board of Supervisors

1643
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:49,569
just has to get together and say all in

1644
01:09:46,630 --> 01:09:52,338
favor of reducing taxes by 50% say aye

1645
01:09:49,569 --> 01:09:55,889
or is it more complicated than that

1646
01:09:52,338 --> 01:09:57,750
well I'd have to you know I have to go

1647
01:09:55,890 --> 01:10:00,390
see at the county's current tax

1648
01:09:57,750 --> 01:10:02,130
ordinance to what extent they can lower

1649
01:10:00,390 --> 01:10:04,920
you know taxes you know what their

1650
01:10:02,130 --> 01:10:07,319
ability to do that is my my guess is

1651
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:10,409
that you know they'd have to agree on

1652
01:10:07,319 --> 01:10:13,799
that and there has been some hesitation

1653
01:10:10,409 --> 01:10:15,420
but the last time reducing the county

1654
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:17,789
taxes was really brought up to the

1655
01:10:15,420 --> 01:10:19,170
supervisors was before coronavirus it's

1656
01:10:17,789 --> 01:10:20,939
been a little while since that efficient

1657
01:10:19,170 --> 01:10:23,100
issue actually got all the way up to

1658
01:10:20,939 --> 01:10:24,599
them I think when it comes back to them

1659
01:10:23,100 --> 01:10:26,940
again which should hopefully be soon

1660
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:29,190
it's something that the Sonoma County

1661
01:10:26,939 --> 01:10:31,500
Growers Alliance is taking on as a main

1662
01:10:29,189 --> 01:10:34,019
policy objective you know for the rest

1663
01:10:31,500 --> 01:10:35,520
of the year reducing the taxes when I

1664
01:10:34,020 --> 01:10:38,010
get back to them again they might be

1665
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:40,890
singing different tune just realizing

1666
01:10:38,010 --> 01:10:43,280
how any relief they can provide is going

1667
01:10:40,890 --> 01:10:47,280
to help these businesses and the county

1668
01:10:43,279 --> 01:10:51,509
so yeah and that politically speaking

1669
01:10:47,279 --> 01:10:52,979
there has been you know the current

1670
01:10:51,510 --> 01:10:56,159
Board of Supervisors is pretty

1671
01:10:52,979 --> 01:10:59,309
supportive there's a one member of the

1672
01:10:56,159 --> 01:11:00,840
board who was very anti cannabis for the

1673
01:10:59,310 --> 01:11:01,289
longest time but seems to be coming

1674
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:03,270
around

1675
01:11:01,289 --> 01:11:06,359
we had a new hemp ordinance that went

1676
01:11:03,270 --> 01:11:08,940
into place last month so people can now

1677
01:11:06,359 --> 01:11:10,289
grow hemp here in Sonoma County as well

1678
01:11:08,939 --> 01:11:11,639
as cannabis so that's something

1679
01:11:10,289 --> 01:11:15,060
interesting that the county's done not a

1680
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:16,770
lot of counties have allowed both and so

1681
01:11:15,060 --> 01:11:18,510
it's yet to be seen how that's gonna

1682
01:11:16,770 --> 01:11:21,090
work out if that's fiction the Board of

1683
01:11:18,510 --> 01:11:24,329
Supervisors and so I'd say our strong

1684
01:11:21,090 --> 01:11:29,840
the industry's strongest ally I'm sorry

1685
01:11:24,329 --> 01:11:34,760
no words yes some weight which of these

1686
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:37,920
this very diverse group of people is is

1687
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:42,030
the most supported than the least

1688
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:44,310
supportive this industry yeah the most

1689
01:11:42,029 --> 01:11:46,319
supportive and the the woman in red hair

1690
01:11:44,310 --> 01:11:47,610
she was just voted out so she's gonna

1691
01:11:46,319 --> 01:11:50,309
finish a term and there's gonna be

1692
01:11:47,609 --> 01:11:53,630
another white man replacing the lady

1693
01:11:50,310 --> 01:11:56,400
with with red hair but the most

1694
01:11:53,630 --> 01:11:58,980
outspoken advocate has been the lady in

1695
01:11:56,399 --> 01:12:01,619
the tan jacket that's Linda Hopkins and

1696
01:11:58,979 --> 01:12:04,709
the most outspoken opponent has been the

1697
01:12:01,619 --> 01:12:05,460
guy on the far right the suddenly larger

1698
01:12:04,710 --> 01:12:08,520
gentleman that's

1699
01:12:05,460 --> 01:12:12,719
David Rabbitt yeah he looks like a

1700
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:14,910
closeted stoner can I fold in a subject

1701
01:12:12,719 --> 01:12:17,189
that you might be dealing with up there

1702
01:12:14,909 --> 01:12:19,979
I'm looking at an article lawsuit seeks

1703
01:12:17,189 --> 01:12:23,488
to shut down busy bees organics in wine

1704
01:12:19,979 --> 01:12:26,939
country this is in Santa Barbara County

1705
01:12:23,488 --> 01:12:29,129
but it's a X and so the lawsuit also

1706
01:12:26,939 --> 01:12:31,229
includes the the board is the

1707
01:12:29,130 --> 01:12:35,850
supervisors I think is they're accusing

1708
01:12:31,229 --> 01:12:38,279
them of a breaking certain laws in

1709
01:12:35,850 --> 01:12:40,560
approving certain permits but it's it's

1710
01:12:38,279 --> 01:12:42,988
ratcheting up and aren't you in wine

1711
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:46,410
country also are you seeing any of these

1712
01:12:42,988 --> 01:12:48,629
dynamics and play yeah I'm up in the

1713
01:12:46,409 --> 01:12:51,149
wine country for wine could do more this

1714
01:12:48,630 --> 01:12:56,510
Sonoma and Napa area but something that

1715
01:12:51,149 --> 01:12:59,879
we have seen up here is concerned by the

1716
01:12:56,510 --> 01:13:01,890
wine growers that it's gonna cannabis is

1717
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:03,630
going to impact there a taste of their

1718
01:13:01,890 --> 01:13:05,969
grapes the taste of the Y and they're

1719
01:13:03,630 --> 01:13:07,949
worried about that kind of a taint going

1720
01:13:05,969 --> 01:13:09,779
on they're concerned about the cannabis

1721
01:13:07,949 --> 01:13:11,609
industry using up all the water that

1722
01:13:09,779 --> 01:13:13,380
they need even though you know wineries

1723
01:13:11,609 --> 01:13:16,409
use far more water than most Canada

1724
01:13:13,380 --> 01:13:19,710
those farms do there has been there was

1725
01:13:16,409 --> 01:13:22,109
a RICO lawsuit that was filed against a

1726
01:13:19,710 --> 01:13:25,739
cannabis operator a year or two ago and

1727
01:13:22,109 --> 01:13:27,539
the idea was that it was hurting and it

1728
01:13:25,738 --> 01:13:30,389
wasn't it wasn't filed by a winery it

1729
01:13:27,539 --> 01:13:31,769
was just these people in a big house but

1730
01:13:30,390 --> 01:13:33,869
they were claiming that their property

1731
01:13:31,770 --> 01:13:36,630
value is going down because of the

1732
01:13:33,869 --> 01:13:38,340
cannabis farm next door I don't know

1733
01:13:36,630 --> 01:13:39,930
what the current status of that lawsuit

1734
01:13:38,340 --> 01:13:42,210
is I know the judge originally

1735
01:13:39,930 --> 01:13:44,610
throughout the RICO claims and was

1736
01:13:42,210 --> 01:13:46,050
letting other parts of it go forward but

1737
01:13:44,609 --> 01:13:48,509
then I didn't follow it I didn't really

1738
01:13:46,050 --> 01:13:52,079
know anyone directly who is involved in

1739
01:13:48,510 --> 01:13:54,360
that lawsuit but it is certainly a

1740
01:13:52,079 --> 01:13:56,869
concern that's being that is being

1741
01:13:54,359 --> 01:13:59,969
raised up here now another concern is

1742
01:13:56,869 --> 01:14:02,609
fire safety and making sure that all

1743
01:13:59,969 --> 01:14:05,039
these roads are fire safe by are

1744
01:14:02,609 --> 01:14:07,439
accessible we do have a lot of one-way

1745
01:14:05,039 --> 01:14:10,260
kind of dirt roads going up mountains in

1746
01:14:07,439 --> 01:14:12,869
the county and it's also fire territory

1747
01:14:10,260 --> 01:14:14,880
and if so it can be dangerous to have a

1748
01:14:12,869 --> 01:14:17,550
cannabis farm at the end of a one-way

1749
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:19,140
road if you need emergency vehicles got

1750
01:14:17,550 --> 01:14:19,320
to come in and out this other people on

1751
01:14:19,140 --> 01:14:21,810
this

1752
01:14:19,319 --> 01:14:24,899
so that's been an issue that opponents

1753
01:14:21,810 --> 01:14:26,820
have started to use to oppose Canada's

1754
01:14:24,899 --> 01:14:28,319
projects it's looking at the roads to

1755
01:14:26,819 --> 01:14:30,389
get in and out making sure they're all

1756
01:14:28,319 --> 01:14:32,158
up to fire codes and and trying to

1757
01:14:30,389 --> 01:14:34,199
install projects based on something like

1758
01:14:32,158 --> 01:14:35,638
that and I think there is there's some

1759
01:14:34,198 --> 01:14:37,289
merit to that obviously the roads need

1760
01:14:35,639 --> 01:14:40,109
to be safe if you literally get vehicles

1761
01:14:37,289 --> 01:14:41,670
in and out safely and not get to a

1762
01:14:40,109 --> 01:14:43,098
problem where the fire truck can't get

1763
01:14:41,670 --> 01:14:45,960
there because the roads not wide enough

1764
01:14:43,099 --> 01:14:48,539
however I think that's also now being

1765
01:14:45,960 --> 01:14:50,279
used to stop like legitimate projects

1766
01:14:48,539 --> 01:14:52,710
that you know do have everything in

1767
01:14:50,279 --> 01:14:58,828
place but there's they're just trying to

1768
01:14:52,710 --> 01:15:02,219
stall them so how about raids you know

1769
01:14:58,828 --> 01:15:04,889
up and Humbolt Mendocino out in San in

1770
01:15:02,219 --> 01:15:06,480
the mountains of San Bernardino friends

1771
01:15:04,889 --> 01:15:09,000
have been talking about the raids are

1772
01:15:06,479 --> 01:15:10,408
coming back again and a full force are

1773
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:14,310
you seeing that in Sonoma or what are

1774
01:15:10,408 --> 01:15:16,289
you seeing I don't think there's been

1775
01:15:14,310 --> 01:15:18,239
any raise in Sonoma County not that I

1776
01:15:16,289 --> 01:15:21,060
can think of I have heard about the ones

1777
01:15:18,238 --> 01:15:25,138
that you mentioned up in the angle and

1778
01:15:21,060 --> 01:15:27,480
down in Central Coast area thankfully

1779
01:15:25,139 --> 01:15:30,239
that hasn't really happened happened

1780
01:15:27,479 --> 01:15:33,000
here and I hope it doesn't I mean it's

1781
01:15:30,238 --> 01:15:35,638
absolutely you know terrifying when when

1782
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:37,948
we have that kind of a harsh law

1783
01:15:35,639 --> 01:15:39,840
enforcement approach to people selling

1784
01:15:37,948 --> 01:15:42,509
these plants and you know I certainly

1785
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:44,429
think there are folks who are bad actors

1786
01:15:42,510 --> 01:15:47,159
and the industry people that are growing

1787
01:15:44,429 --> 01:15:49,380
in you know state and national parks

1788
01:15:47,158 --> 01:15:51,779
people who are using dangerous chemicals

1789
01:15:49,380 --> 01:15:53,849
people who are just you know not

1790
01:15:51,779 --> 01:15:55,679
following the rules but that's not the

1791
01:15:53,849 --> 01:15:59,429
folks who are in the regulated industry

1792
01:15:55,679 --> 01:16:01,560
for the most part and so I'm hopeful

1793
01:15:59,429 --> 01:16:04,289
that they don't you know continue

1794
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:05,789
resorting to those scary tactics that

1795
01:16:04,289 --> 01:16:09,139
really you know can leave people with

1796
01:16:05,789 --> 01:16:15,618
PTSD for a long time to come afterwards

1797
01:16:09,139 --> 01:16:18,300
yeah I mean and Eric how about in in LA

1798
01:16:15,618 --> 01:16:21,000
the raids they have don't come close to

1799
01:16:18,300 --> 01:16:24,329
making a dent in anything you know and a

1800
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:27,448
lot of it as well is that especially

1801
01:16:24,328 --> 01:16:30,840
with kovat 19 going on there there has

1802
01:16:27,448 --> 01:16:32,669
been a lot of a lot of violent offenders

1803
01:16:30,840 --> 01:16:35,010
released from jail who are back

1804
01:16:32,670 --> 01:16:36,239
the into the city here and so property

1805
01:16:35,010 --> 01:16:38,460
crimes have gone way up

1806
01:16:36,239 --> 01:16:41,189
break-ins have gone way up and that's

1807
01:16:38,460 --> 01:16:43,319
something I've over the last two months

1808
01:16:41,189 --> 01:16:45,569
with indoor growers here break-ins have

1809
01:16:43,319 --> 01:16:48,259
probably went up a thousand percent you

1810
01:16:45,569 --> 01:16:51,599
know I know I know of uh

1811
01:16:48,260 --> 01:16:53,070
some companies that have had attempted

1812
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:54,810
break-ins every week you know and

1813
01:16:53,069 --> 01:16:56,939
typically maybe you'll get an attempted

1814
01:16:54,810 --> 01:16:58,710
break-in once every three or four months

1815
01:16:56,939 --> 01:17:01,079
you know cuz it just happens you know

1816
01:16:58,710 --> 01:17:03,390
there's there you know a lot of these

1817
01:17:01,079 --> 01:17:05,880
are done by criminal gangs and it's very

1818
01:17:03,390 --> 01:17:07,380
organized but yeah the amount of

1819
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:10,050
break-ins over the last month and a half

1820
01:17:07,380 --> 01:17:13,619
is just levels that I've never heard of

1821
01:17:10,050 --> 01:17:15,869
before so that's definitely something

1822
01:17:13,619 --> 01:17:17,670
going on but yes and then police are

1823
01:17:15,869 --> 01:17:20,130
just very occupied here with everything

1824
01:17:17,670 --> 01:17:22,890
else for them I think cannabis is a very

1825
01:17:20,130 --> 01:17:25,020
low priority which is frustrating and I

1826
01:17:22,890 --> 01:17:27,869
know Tom you hear this from Greg all the

1827
01:17:25,020 --> 01:17:29,970
time is that the illegal shops are there

1828
01:17:27,869 --> 01:17:32,369
sometimes a block and a half from a

1829
01:17:29,970 --> 01:17:34,289
regulated shop the inspect the permit

1830
01:17:32,369 --> 01:17:36,420
people come show up the inspected shop

1831
01:17:34,289 --> 01:17:38,159
and they'll say hey a block and a half

1832
01:17:36,420 --> 01:17:39,750
away is an illegal shop wanted to go

1833
01:17:38,159 --> 01:17:41,789
check them out and the inspectors are

1834
01:17:39,750 --> 01:17:44,039
scared to go there you know and so they

1835
01:17:41,789 --> 01:17:47,250
don't really do anything and you know I

1836
01:17:44,039 --> 01:17:50,640
think really with with enforcement if

1837
01:17:47,250 --> 01:17:53,369
there's one thing the last where we have

1838
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:55,530
ninety years of drug war has showed us

1839
01:17:53,369 --> 01:17:58,470
and that enforcement really really is

1840
01:17:55,529 --> 01:18:00,479
not the answer and the answer is to

1841
01:17:58,470 --> 01:18:02,280
incentivize legal businesses to be

1842
01:18:00,479 --> 01:18:05,669
competitive with the illegal businesses

1843
01:18:02,279 --> 01:18:08,069
imagine if everything was flipped in 80%

1844
01:18:05,670 --> 01:18:09,810
of the market was legal and only 20% was

1845
01:18:08,069 --> 01:18:12,479
illegal we'd be very close to stomping

1846
01:18:09,810 --> 01:18:16,680
it out maybe we can start rebranding

1847
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:19,199
that herd immunity yeah I mean that that

1848
01:18:16,680 --> 01:18:21,360
gets back to the sensible taxes I mean

1849
01:18:19,199 --> 01:18:24,090
that that's pretty much the main all

1850
01:18:21,359 --> 01:18:25,949
they need to do is be sensible and you

1851
01:18:24,090 --> 01:18:29,130
know you don't really have a moonshine

1852
01:18:25,949 --> 01:18:34,260
market you don't really have a you know

1853
01:18:29,130 --> 01:18:36,329
and illicit you know cereal or CPG

1854
01:18:34,260 --> 01:18:39,180
market I mean maybe you have knockoffs

1855
01:18:36,329 --> 01:18:42,659
on the on the you know streets of

1856
01:18:39,180 --> 01:18:45,840
Chinatown in New York but uh it's tough

1857
01:18:42,659 --> 01:18:46,500
to be you know I remember when they did

1858
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:48,360
the first bug

1859
01:18:46,500 --> 01:18:50,430
when Jerry Brown was governor and this

1860
01:18:48,359 --> 01:18:52,589
is part of it you know we talk about

1861
01:18:50,430 --> 01:18:54,900
what we understand is economics because

1862
01:18:52,590 --> 01:18:57,810
we've all owned businesses and it's you

1863
01:18:54,899 --> 01:19:00,299
know if you lower if you lower the taxes

1864
01:18:57,810 --> 01:19:03,240
you generate more economic activity

1865
01:19:00,300 --> 01:19:05,489
which often will actually increase the

1866
01:19:03,239 --> 01:19:08,250
revenue you know I remember when the

1867
01:19:05,489 --> 01:19:10,260
first tax report came in and it was one

1868
01:19:08,250 --> 01:19:12,329
third of projections you know when Jerry

1869
01:19:10,260 --> 01:19:13,890
Brown was governor deep you know they

1870
01:19:12,329 --> 01:19:16,229
talked about the first tax cut they

1871
01:19:13,890 --> 01:19:17,760
projected 120 million coming in or

1872
01:19:16,229 --> 01:19:20,299
something like that and it ended up

1873
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:23,579
being like 30 million that came in and

1874
01:19:20,300 --> 01:19:26,130
the first hit from his quote basically

1875
01:19:23,579 --> 01:19:27,989
was like you know well if we hit

1876
01:19:26,130 --> 01:19:29,699
one-third of our tax revenue we're not

1877
01:19:27,989 --> 01:19:32,489
going to cut taxes because then we're

1878
01:19:29,699 --> 01:19:34,289
gonna get even less money and they you

1879
01:19:32,489 --> 01:19:36,449
know a lot of people they just don't

1880
01:19:34,289 --> 01:19:38,130
even look at that other side that you

1881
01:19:36,449 --> 01:19:39,689
know if you tax it less you're gonna

1882
01:19:38,130 --> 01:19:42,060
have more businesses coming in which

1883
01:19:39,689 --> 01:19:44,189
will raise it and that they're oblivious

1884
01:19:42,060 --> 01:19:47,910
to that side of the argument and I don't

1885
01:19:44,189 --> 01:19:49,710
know how to how to broach that gap so

1886
01:19:47,909 --> 01:19:52,109
that do you understand that you know

1887
01:19:49,710 --> 01:19:55,170
that that's actually a real thing you

1888
01:19:52,109 --> 01:19:58,469
know that gets back to me kind of it

1889
01:19:55,170 --> 01:20:01,260
seems so obvious you know I I bring up

1890
01:19:58,470 --> 01:20:03,750
Walmart Costco and Amazon they do high

1891
01:20:01,260 --> 01:20:07,079
volume low margin and they they have

1892
01:20:03,750 --> 01:20:09,479
their very profitable right vs.

1893
01:20:07,079 --> 01:20:12,000
Lamborghini which sells you know a

1894
01:20:09,479 --> 01:20:14,039
limited number of cars per year at a

1895
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:15,899
very high margin but not a lot of them

1896
01:20:14,039 --> 01:20:17,699
and that's our that's our that's our

1897
01:20:15,899 --> 01:20:20,969
California tax structure where the

1898
01:20:17,699 --> 01:20:22,619
Lamborghini tax structure but nobody's

1899
01:20:20,970 --> 01:20:27,060
making lots of money because you also

1900
01:20:22,619 --> 01:20:34,229
don't get to deduct anything and but so

1901
01:20:27,060 --> 01:20:36,360
just quickly when when you get paid but

1902
01:20:34,229 --> 01:20:39,209
so your distributor collects money from

1903
01:20:36,359 --> 01:20:44,009
the retail shops and then do they litter

1904
01:20:39,210 --> 01:20:46,230
like is everything in cash or talk about

1905
01:20:44,010 --> 01:20:49,949
like are they walking in with a big

1906
01:20:46,229 --> 01:20:55,919
duffel bag of cash or do you get checks

1907
01:20:49,949 --> 01:20:59,220
for anything or no but but it is it is

1908
01:20:55,920 --> 01:21:00,369
all cash like there's no checks or

1909
01:20:59,220 --> 01:21:03,740
anything

1910
01:21:00,369 --> 01:21:06,859
yeah yeah it's it's it's cash I mean I I

1911
01:21:03,739 --> 01:21:09,039
could get checks if I wanted to but then

1912
01:21:06,859 --> 01:21:12,559
you run into the whole banking thing and

1913
01:21:09,039 --> 01:21:15,079
you know but that cash is just the

1914
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:19,490
easiest way to avoid D do you do you

1915
01:21:15,079 --> 01:21:25,939
currently have a bank without naming

1916
01:21:19,489 --> 01:21:32,389
names right but how many how many banks

1917
01:21:25,939 --> 01:21:36,019
have you gone through um well let's see

1918
01:21:32,390 --> 01:21:38,180
I you know the thing with banks isn't if

1919
01:21:36,020 --> 01:21:41,360
banks know you're operating a cannabis

1920
01:21:38,180 --> 01:21:43,970
business they won't allow you to use

1921
01:21:41,359 --> 01:21:47,089
their bank and as far as I know I'm not

1922
01:21:43,970 --> 01:21:50,060
sure if you're allowed to tell a bank

1923
01:21:47,090 --> 01:21:52,670
your banking account is for something

1924
01:21:50,060 --> 01:21:55,100
other than a cannabis business so I you

1925
01:21:52,670 --> 01:21:57,409
know I'm not sure about the legalities

1926
01:21:55,100 --> 01:22:02,450
of any of that and it's not to say I do

1927
01:21:57,409 --> 01:22:04,430
or don't do any of right but but that

1928
01:22:02,449 --> 01:22:06,609
but but then the persistence of the

1929
01:22:04,430 --> 01:22:14,690
Facebook machine well I'm just gonna

1930
01:22:06,609 --> 01:22:16,819
write that you know I've been to this

1931
01:22:14,689 --> 01:22:21,009
industry I've been in this industry a

1932
01:22:16,819 --> 01:22:23,179
long time and so self-incriminate and

1933
01:22:21,010 --> 01:22:25,039
coughing criminais ssin is not the best

1934
01:22:23,180 --> 01:22:26,990
thing which I'm sure Lauren will agree

1935
01:22:25,039 --> 01:22:29,829
with me that self-incrimination it is

1936
01:22:26,989 --> 01:22:29,829
never a good

1937
01:22:31,090 --> 01:22:39,529
don't don't incriminate yourself it

1938
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:42,319
whatever I think we can so any any I

1939
01:22:39,529 --> 01:22:46,009
think we can probably wrap and I just

1940
01:22:42,319 --> 01:22:47,750
wanted to see if Lauren or or Eric if

1941
01:22:46,010 --> 01:22:50,210
you guys have any last words

1942
01:22:47,750 --> 01:22:54,289
faint things that are top of mind for

1943
01:22:50,210 --> 01:22:58,310
you in the the joyful California

1944
01:22:54,289 --> 01:23:00,519
cannabis industry so as far as from

1945
01:22:58,310 --> 01:23:03,110
myself you know I would just like to

1946
01:23:00,520 --> 01:23:05,270
point out we didn't really get into it

1947
01:23:03,109 --> 01:23:09,399
but there was that really bad fire that

1948
01:23:05,270 --> 01:23:12,979
happened on Saturday in downtown LA on

1949
01:23:09,399 --> 01:23:15,498
headshop Row where they were where

1950
01:23:12,979 --> 01:23:18,619
most likely tens of thousands of cans of

1951
01:23:15,498 --> 01:23:21,139
butane that ultimately were most likely

1952
01:23:18,618 --> 01:23:26,179
intended for people to illegally make

1953
01:23:21,139 --> 01:23:28,368
hash oil and I think one most of the

1954
01:23:26,179 --> 01:23:30,349
initial reports blamed it on making hash

1955
01:23:28,368 --> 01:23:31,880
oil which turned out to not be the case

1956
01:23:30,349 --> 01:23:34,610
and you know our industry gets blamed

1957
01:23:31,880 --> 01:23:37,578
for that and secondly it's another

1958
01:23:34,609 --> 01:23:41,808
example of why we need to continue to

1959
01:23:37,578 --> 01:23:43,849
work harder to to make our industry a

1960
01:23:41,809 --> 01:23:45,949
hundred percent legal aboveboard and

1961
01:23:43,849 --> 01:23:48,469
away from the illicit industry so things

1962
01:23:45,948 --> 01:23:51,169
like this don't happen some of the first

1963
01:23:48,469 --> 01:23:54,649
responders and LAFD firefighters were

1964
01:23:51,170 --> 01:23:57,859
hurt very very badly in that fire one of

1965
01:23:54,649 --> 01:23:59,420
the injuries I believe is is going to be

1966
01:23:57,859 --> 01:24:02,598
one that you know will be life-changing

1967
01:23:59,420 --> 01:24:06,639
for one of these firefighters and you

1968
01:24:02,599 --> 01:24:11,420
know this this happened because of the

1969
01:24:06,639 --> 01:24:13,368
illegal industry you know and it is just

1970
01:24:11,420 --> 01:24:15,649
you know it's and and at the same time

1971
01:24:13,368 --> 01:24:17,389
we kind of get blamed for it so it's

1972
01:24:15,649 --> 01:24:19,219
just shows that there's more work for us

1973
01:24:17,389 --> 01:24:21,800
to be done and we have to continue to

1974
01:24:19,219 --> 01:24:23,809
work to make it a hundred percent legal

1975
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:25,788
industry in a zero percent illegal

1976
01:24:23,809 --> 01:24:28,279
industry so we don't have these things

1977
01:24:25,788 --> 01:24:31,609
happen and god bless our firefighters

1978
01:24:28,279 --> 01:24:33,139
for going into these situations and it

1979
01:24:31,609 --> 01:24:35,238
really just illustrates the bravery of

1980
01:24:33,139 --> 01:24:39,409
them all of our first responders you

1981
01:24:35,238 --> 01:24:41,178
know let's throw LAPD in there for you

1982
01:24:39,408 --> 01:24:42,859
know that they do a lot of a lot of

1983
01:24:41,179 --> 01:24:44,658
tough work as well and all of our first

1984
01:24:42,859 --> 01:24:46,069
responders all over the state and so

1985
01:24:44,658 --> 01:24:50,748
really just want to give a shout out to

1986
01:24:46,069 --> 01:24:52,130
them and yeah that I guess that's where

1987
01:24:50,748 --> 01:24:53,719
all ended on something kind of

1988
01:24:52,130 --> 01:24:55,069
completely different and I'm sure more

1989
01:24:53,719 --> 01:24:57,698
will come out to this and it'll become a

1990
01:24:55,069 --> 01:25:00,819
topic for another time

1991
01:24:57,698 --> 01:25:04,069
Loren top of my mind right now is

1992
01:25:00,819 --> 01:25:06,978
getting cannabis businesses the the

1993
01:25:04,069 --> 01:25:10,368
relief and the assistance they need so

1994
01:25:06,979 --> 01:25:14,090
you know that could look like extending

1995
01:25:10,368 --> 01:25:16,339
the deferral relief that the licensing

1996
01:25:14,090 --> 01:25:18,920
agencies just offered you know if we can

1997
01:25:16,340 --> 01:25:22,639
get that extended past 60 days that

1998
01:25:18,920 --> 01:25:26,440
would be great if we can get at the

1999
01:25:22,639 --> 01:25:29,090
federal level there's efforts now to get

2000
01:25:26,439 --> 01:25:30,948
first of all to treat cannabis like

2001
01:25:29,090 --> 01:25:33,199
other businesses so they're eligible for

2002
01:25:30,948 --> 01:25:36,558
all the SBA loans and other federal

2003
01:25:33,198 --> 01:25:39,019
relief but also now the cannabis effects

2004
01:25:36,559 --> 01:25:41,510
for cannabis banking has been added to

2005
01:25:39,020 --> 01:25:44,480
the latest coronavirus relief bill and

2006
01:25:41,510 --> 01:25:47,809
it's called the heroes Act and as as

2007
01:25:44,479 --> 01:25:49,939
written that would you know open up

2008
01:25:47,809 --> 01:25:52,639
banking access relief for cannabis

2009
01:25:49,939 --> 01:25:54,948
company is and that would that would

2010
01:25:52,639 --> 01:25:56,809
help a lot I think I have a lot of

2011
01:25:54,948 --> 01:25:59,658
clients that are struggling because they

2012
01:25:56,809 --> 01:26:00,860
don't have a good access to banking or

2013
01:25:59,658 --> 01:26:03,649
their accounts to keep getting shut down

2014
01:26:00,859 --> 01:26:06,920
or and it limits your ability to get to

2015
01:26:03,649 --> 01:26:09,288
get funding really as well so that is

2016
01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:11,029
we'll see if it passes I'm not super

2017
01:26:09,288 --> 01:26:13,340
optimistic about it but I think what it

2018
01:26:11,029 --> 01:26:17,559
shows is that at the federal level level

2019
01:26:13,340 --> 01:26:20,719
I actually think that coronavirus has

2020
01:26:17,559 --> 01:26:23,420
increased the chances of cannabis

2021
01:26:20,719 --> 01:26:24,980
getting federally legal sooner just

2022
01:26:23,420 --> 01:26:26,599
because so many different states have

2023
01:26:24,979 --> 01:26:30,019
deem these businesses to be essential

2024
01:26:26,599 --> 01:26:32,960
and so many different now federal law

2025
01:26:30,020 --> 01:26:34,940
makers are signing on to things that

2026
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:37,880
would add you know provide cannabis

2027
01:26:34,939 --> 01:26:39,948
relief I think that there is a tide

2028
01:26:37,880 --> 01:26:42,109
that's you know turning their federally

2029
01:26:39,948 --> 01:26:44,210
I'm optimistic about that I think folks

2030
01:26:42,109 --> 01:26:45,769
should get involved and advocate to all

2031
01:26:44,210 --> 01:26:49,939
your representatives local state and

2032
01:26:45,770 --> 01:26:51,440
federal because you know legalization

2033
01:26:49,939 --> 01:26:53,419
would certainly help a lot of things

2034
01:26:51,439 --> 01:26:54,678
then we can do cross-border transactions

2035
01:26:53,420 --> 01:26:56,859
we could you know participate in a

2036
01:26:54,679 --> 01:26:59,630
global cannabis market that is out there

2037
01:26:56,859 --> 01:27:02,269
and so that's really the thing and also

2038
01:26:59,630 --> 01:27:04,250
just you know making sure that everyone

2039
01:27:02,270 --> 01:27:07,690
stays safe right now it's a scary and

2040
01:27:04,250 --> 01:27:10,069
confusing time stay safe stay sane and

2041
01:27:07,689 --> 01:27:12,259
helping each other out and well we can

2042
01:27:10,069 --> 01:27:14,618
get through this but no one can do it

2043
01:27:12,260 --> 01:27:17,960
alone we got to be there for each other

2044
01:27:14,618 --> 01:27:21,848
alright and on that we will end the

2045
01:27:17,960 --> 01:27:25,880
conversation let me just conclude with

2046
01:27:21,849 --> 01:27:29,389
the slide and so thank you everyone I

2047
01:27:25,880 --> 01:27:31,618
appreciate your time and with that we

2048
01:27:29,389 --> 01:27:33,679
are stopping the livestream

2049
01:27:31,618 --> 01:27:33,679
you
