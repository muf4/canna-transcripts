1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,109
there's flavonoids and esters that don't

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:07,020
come over and have steam distillation

3
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:10,138
like flavonoids kind of get the short

4
00:00:07,019 --> 00:00:14,039
stick talked about Maddie no it's

5
00:00:10,138 --> 00:00:18,079
terpenes so give a plug to flavonoids

6
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:23,789
why do we care about flavonoids um they

7
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:27,809
there I'm not completely versed on their

8
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:32,759
medical benefits but they are heavier

9
00:00:27,809 --> 00:00:35,369
molecules that add flavor to the profile

10
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:38,939
of cannabis mountains chirping Jets

11
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:41,250
Mallory terpenes deals specifically with

12
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:46,558
your olfactory senses where flavonoids

13
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:51,448
deal with your Thalia in their taste yes

14
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:54,718
and the molecule is way heavier on the

15
00:00:51,448 --> 00:00:59,218
flavonoids so it's it it does not get

16
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:00,719
distilled out with yeah it's it's not

17
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:02,698
part of the distilled terpenes isn't

18
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,290
that part of a terpene blend same thing

19
00:01:02,698 --> 00:01:06,810
with the esters as well and these are

20
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:08,820
things that that blend to the entire

21
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:11,879
smell profile we call it a terpene

22
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:15,750
profile but it's a it's a smell or it's

23
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:21,599
an experience profile yes yep and that's

24
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:23,909
ears yes and we don't know what happens

25
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:27,209
when you what kind of reactions happen

26
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:29,359
when you combust all those different 180

27
00:01:27,209 --> 00:01:33,530
different compounds I know

28
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:36,509
[Laughter]

29
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:39,329
but yeah a medical level like there's

30
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:42,409
you know I don't circling this way back

31
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:45,478
this conference that we're doing is like

32
00:01:42,409 --> 00:01:47,280
focused exactly on that there's a lot of

33
00:01:45,478 --> 00:01:52,170
fiction out there a lot of people have a

34
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:54,689
lot of really good ideas about what

35
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:57,359
cannabinoids do what different compounds

36
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:59,250
what you know full-spectrum single eye

37
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:02,879
slits you know a lot of people have some

38
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:07,019
good ideas but there is not enough

39
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:09,030
science that are you know propping up

40
00:02:07,019 --> 00:02:11,250
these ideas or smashing them to pieces

41
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:13,090
and so like that the conference we're

42
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:15,068
doing is is really focused on

43
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:19,750
people who are actually doing that

44
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:21,549
research and finding some answers can't

45
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:22,810
come out and you know talk and bring it

46
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:25,900
to the attention of the people that are

47
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:29,800
making the oil and and you know this in

48
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:34,420
the gray black and newly white market

49
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:37,120
and it's like there's a disconnection

50
00:02:34,419 --> 00:02:38,679
between the cutting-edge research and

51
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,509
the people that are making the medicine

52
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:43,239
and once you start connecting those

53
00:02:40,509 --> 00:02:45,789
people that is like I think that there's

54
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:48,159
a lot of great things can happen you go

55
00:02:45,789 --> 00:02:51,219
back to like you know you want to make

56
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:54,759
the best product like find out what's in

57
00:02:51,219 --> 00:02:56,409
what delivery method is best for you

58
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:58,840
know the doctors are doing research on

59
00:02:56,409 --> 00:03:01,209
that cannabinoid or that group of

60
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:03,819
cannabinoids you know how that goes

61
00:03:01,209 --> 00:03:06,640
intersection of your stomach your lungs

62
00:03:03,818 --> 00:03:08,919
your but we've got a long way to go in

63
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:12,339
research and like connecting the people

64
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:14,469
that actually are passionate about about

65
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:16,060
it on the side of making the medicine is

66
00:03:14,469 --> 00:03:19,319
really important with the people that

67
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:19,319
are actually researching and
