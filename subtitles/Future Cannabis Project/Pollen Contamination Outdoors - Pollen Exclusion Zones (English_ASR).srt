1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,589
you have particular experience in the

2
00:00:02,279 --> 00:00:07,410
dangers of pollen contamination right

3
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:09,599
and you know since both feminized and

4
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:11,789
regular Auto seeds exist I think this

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:14,879
would be a good moment for you to make

6
00:00:11,789 --> 00:00:17,759
your pitch for for you know running you

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,800
know not running males outdoors I'd love

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,900
you to share the story about your valley

9
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,539
just to make everybody more aware of the

10
00:00:21,899 --> 00:00:25,799
dangers of pollen if you if you have a

11
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:27,750
pollinated crop and you're growing

12
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,490
outside you're gonna lose 30% of your

13
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:32,780
total cannabinoids and 50% of your

14
00:00:29,489 --> 00:00:36,929
biomass that the seed is a tremendous

15
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:38,308
energy-sapping creation that that ends

16
00:00:36,929 --> 00:00:40,619
up taking the power away from your

17
00:00:38,308 --> 00:00:42,929
plants in reducing the not only the

18
00:00:40,619 --> 00:00:44,250
profit the profitability but the actual

19
00:00:42,929 --> 00:00:45,119
amount of cannabinoids that you can

20
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:48,238
harvest outdoors

21
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:51,509
I know Oregon at this point we're trying

22
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:53,609
to launch a nonprofit organization that

23
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:56,488
will help in the future in terms of

24
00:00:53,609 --> 00:00:58,320
creating buffer zones between farms so

25
00:00:56,488 --> 00:01:00,509
that we don't have issues of pollen

26
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,909
contamination see Oregon cannabis

27
00:01:00,509 --> 00:01:04,079
pinning Association oh CPA org it's the

28
00:01:02,909 --> 00:01:06,899
only thing I'll advertise today

29
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:08,250
hopefully and we're really just kind of

30
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,409
in a we're trying to raise awareness

31
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:13,438
this year and then actually move into a

32
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:15,930
more formal pinning system for 2020 but

33
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:18,629
pollen outdoors is a huge issue and

34
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:21,360
there are a number of people who are

35
00:01:18,629 --> 00:01:24,030
either growing regular male female seeds

36
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:25,799
or trying to create seed outdoors just

37
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:28,290
because you can produce so much it's

38
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:31,560
it's a tremendously productive way to

39
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:33,840
make seed but we've had to basically go

40
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,939
to a lot of small-time breeders who are

41
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,500
saying oh man this is the big rush I

42
00:01:35,938 --> 00:01:39,269
want to make sure that I can make a

43
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:42,269
bunch of seed this year and then sell it

44
00:01:39,269 --> 00:01:44,219
for next year not knowing that in doing

45
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:45,450
so not only are they not going to get a

46
00:01:44,219 --> 00:01:46,828
successful crop because there's other

47
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:49,469
people who are doing that and now you

48
00:01:46,828 --> 00:01:51,899
have a contaminated crop yourself with

49
00:01:49,469 --> 00:01:54,810
no purity that you won't be able to sell

50
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:56,728
if you're a moral or ethical person but

51
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:58,140
you're also going to destroy all of your

52
00:01:56,728 --> 00:02:00,000
surrounding neighbors ability to

53
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:01,170
actually grow a crop and have something

54
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,090
that's valuable at the end of the year

55
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:04,590
so it really comes down it's a it's a

56
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:08,729
touchy subject for a lot of people but

57
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:10,450
it is definitely in terms of being able

58
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:13,270
to create an environment

59
00:02:10,449 --> 00:02:15,549
that we all can continue to produce

60
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:17,260
cannabis in in an environment that our

61
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:19,150
kids can potentially continue to produce

62
00:02:17,259 --> 00:02:21,310
cannabis in Oregon is one of those

63
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:23,200
really really lucky spots we're in a

64
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:25,330
sweet spot we can grow good stuff

65
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:27,969
we have great breeders we have good

66
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:29,170
water we have good land but we really

67
00:02:27,969 --> 00:02:32,109
need to make sure that we can protect

68
00:02:29,169 --> 00:02:35,708
that and its pollen travels a long ways

69
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:37,720
long ways it's it's dangerous and I

70
00:02:35,709 --> 00:02:39,580
think that you know these these pollen

71
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:40,930
exclusion zones which Ivan call Youm do

72
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,709
you have an actual official name for him

73
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:43,540
sounds good

74
00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:44,650
yeah pollen exclusion get Sonya so

75
00:02:43,539 --> 00:02:47,079
that's what I've been calling it to

76
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:50,500
people and and the first time that Seth

77
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:53,350
posted about this on their Instagram it

78
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:56,139
was ugly you know that the thread was

79
00:02:53,349 --> 00:02:59,889
mostly people saying you know you know

80
00:02:56,139 --> 00:03:03,579
you will not tell me what to do with my

81
00:02:59,889 --> 00:03:06,309
property , dammit you know and Monsanto

82
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:08,739
you want to control the seeds yeah

83
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:10,030
exactly and you know and I get where

84
00:03:08,739 --> 00:03:11,950
people are coming from because I don't

85
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:13,989
like to be told what to do either but

86
00:03:11,949 --> 00:03:16,629
what it is it's a it's an it's an

87
00:03:13,989 --> 00:03:19,870
economic and horticultural opportunity

88
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:23,019
for right where almost all of us live

89
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:25,629
here and so what we're seeing is that

90
00:03:23,019 --> 00:03:29,049
you know did just like Napa Valley right

91
00:03:25,629 --> 00:03:30,340
they are growing world-class wine but

92
00:03:29,049 --> 00:03:32,950
there are certain things that the

93
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:37,599
community has all agreed to do and not

94
00:03:32,949 --> 00:03:39,578
do so that they don't screw up the the

95
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:41,769
you know the wineries and and their

96
00:03:39,579 --> 00:03:46,000
ability to grow grapes because it brings

97
00:03:41,769 --> 00:03:49,390
so much economic power to the region and

98
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,189
for me that's what I see for for these

99
00:03:49,389 --> 00:03:52,839
beautiful valleys throughout Oregon

100
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:55,389
where they can where they can you know

101
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:57,189
they've already got hemp farmers it is a

102
00:03:55,389 --> 00:04:00,639
burgeoning industry that is is

103
00:03:57,189 --> 00:04:02,079
lightyears ahead of many of the rest of

104
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:04,889
the parts of the world that are going to

105
00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:08,590
try to follow up and when you have a

106
00:04:04,889 --> 00:04:09,608
lead even though I don't want anybody to

107
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:12,969
tell me what to do with my property

108
00:04:09,609 --> 00:04:15,700
either I really hope that those people

109
00:04:12,969 --> 00:04:18,220
would keep open minds because the the

110
00:04:15,699 --> 00:04:20,529
the reasons for not growing pollinating

111
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:23,400
cannabis plants outdoors make a lot of

112
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:25,198
sense for the Oregon community

113
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:26,668
and I think that is lost on a lot of

114
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,620
people because they aren't they haven't

115
00:04:26,668 --> 00:04:30,418
let their ears be open to the argument I

116
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:32,759
think people think it's about control

117
00:04:30,418 --> 00:04:34,409
and the the problem with this is that

118
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:36,360
it's not about trying to prevent people

119
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:38,970
from making seed I encourage people to

120
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:40,560
go go go do it like I've said before

121
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:41,910
it's a man's Batory not only to grow it

122
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,470
but to breed it and then see the outcome

123
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:45,180
it's it's a it's a beautiful thing and

124
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:48,120
it's part of what makes us human

125
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:50,759
we all could probably agree that people

126
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:53,220
have a right to fire right you can have

127
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:55,650
a fire on your property that's cool

128
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:57,419
until it jumps your fence and burns down

129
00:04:55,649 --> 00:04:59,609
your neighbor's house at that point

130
00:04:57,418 --> 00:05:01,409
that's your liability it's not your fire

131
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:03,030
and that's really what we're looking at

132
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:05,010
everyone in Oregon has a right to farm

133
00:05:03,029 --> 00:05:06,989
but you don't have a right to exclude

134
00:05:05,009 --> 00:05:09,449
other people from being able to engage

135
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:11,370
in meaningful economic activity that not

136
00:05:09,449 --> 00:05:13,770
only is helping that themselves but

137
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:20,069
helping other people isn't the general

138
00:05:13,769 --> 00:05:22,258
motto your fun ends when the other guy's

139
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:24,209
displeasure begins and so you do not

140
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:26,370
have a right to plant seeds outside I

141
00:05:24,209 --> 00:05:28,888
would say you don't have a right to do

142
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:31,139
it period if it's gonna impact your

143
00:05:28,889 --> 00:05:32,970
neighbor you don't have that right and

144
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:35,280
also for for folks who are thinking

145
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:36,479
about doing you know 3 4 plants in your

146
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:38,668
backyard and you're gonna bring in a

147
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:41,519
mail that's way different than we're

148
00:05:38,668 --> 00:05:44,939
talking about you know growing a KERS of

149
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:47,399
regular seeds Russian next-door no no

150
00:05:44,939 --> 00:05:48,930
it's fine or we've had to take because

151
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:50,310
of that and and we don't want to stop

152
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:52,079
anybody from having that right but to be

153
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:53,399
able to protect our interests we had to

154
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:56,609
make sure that our greenhouses are

155
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:58,109
sealed we only make seed in places that

156
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:59,550
we're comfortable making it and then

157
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:01,430
once it comes out we still have to test

158
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:03,930
it just to make sure that it is what we

159
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:06,329
what we think it is and to let you know

160
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:08,370
that Seth practices what he preaches it

161
00:06:06,329 --> 00:06:11,098
is really crazy to go into their

162
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:15,209
breeding warehouses or greenhouses

163
00:06:11,098 --> 00:06:17,819
because they are they suck you in right

164
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:19,228
so that none of the pollen escapes when

165
00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:21,240
