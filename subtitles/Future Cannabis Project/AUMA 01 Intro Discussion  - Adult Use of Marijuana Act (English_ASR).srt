1
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:18,719
we have who I've been introduced to just

2
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:21,719
recently three very active uh voices in

3
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:25,239
the in the Cannabis

4
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:27,160
industry uh I am as Susan explained a

5
00:00:25,239 --> 00:00:29,320
contributing writer for Entrepreneur

6
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:31,278
magazine and Huffington Post and so

7
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:33,640
you'll begin to see that the mainstream

8
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:36,000
media and journalists like I have gone

9
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:37,799
in and begun to take an interest in

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,359
reporting on the hemp and cannabis

11
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:42,878
industry uh to uh the mainstream

12
00:00:40,359 --> 00:00:46,039
audience particularly from a technology

13
00:00:42,878 --> 00:00:48,198
and small business

14
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:49,280
perspective uh I primarily cover

15
00:00:48,198 --> 00:00:51,719
immersion

16
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:54,799
Technologies and so the Cannabis

17
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:57,600
industry is of course full of those so I

18
00:00:54,799 --> 00:01:00,078
was uh selected to moderate this panel

19
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,719
because I come from a unique perspective

20
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:06,719
being newer to the industry uh and and

21
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:07,759
having an an unbiased opinion on Prop 64

22
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:09,400
and so it's interesting because I've

23
00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:11,959
been here you know just this is the

24
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:13,719
second day now and I'll go and I'll talk

25
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:17,039
to a group of folks who were you know

26
00:01:13,719 --> 00:01:18,840
Pro 64 and and I'll think to myself well

27
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,400
that makes a whole lot of sense you know

28
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,680
as a journalist I'm supposed to remain

29
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,040
objective and then I'll talk to somebody

30
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,960
from no one64 about what their concerns

31
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,079
are as well and then I think oh yeah

32
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:30,839
this this uh this proposition doesn't

33
00:01:29,078 --> 00:01:32,919
doesn't you know doesn't live up to what

34
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,759
it's saying so I go back and forth and I

35
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:37,399
think one of you know one of the

36
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:39,599
disciplines that makes writing unique in

37
00:01:37,399 --> 00:01:41,200
this space is that you have to be uh

38
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:42,679
objective and so I would like to invite

39
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,719
everybody in the audience as we kind of

40
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:48,200
go through what this proposition means

41
00:01:45,718 --> 00:01:50,280
for California look at it from an

42
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:52,439
objective perspective and see if we can

43
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,718
take different parts uh from the

44
00:01:52,438 --> 00:01:56,718
conversation another thing that we're

45
00:01:53,718 --> 00:01:59,038
going to we're going to do is uh kind of

46
00:01:56,718 --> 00:02:01,319
a different format for this we're going

47
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:03,759
to begin with brief kind of three minute

48
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:07,000
introductions but then we want to get

49
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:09,840
into it's a lot um like Betty was just

50
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,520
saying too we really do Envision that

51
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,878
this is going to happen at some point so

52
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:17,920
let's let's project out 10 years from

53
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:20,079
now what does that ideal solution look

54
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:21,719
like so let's we've heard a lot about

55
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,120
the propositions themselves some of the

56
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:26,280
implications let's start from from from

57
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:29,280
that Arena begin to have that

58
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:33,400
conversation to do that we'll go through

59
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:35,360
what C normal is suggesting as some of

60
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,519
their recommendations right for the

61
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,480
existing

62
00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:40,200
proposition and we'll get into some

63
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:45,079
Dialogue on that then we'll open it up

64
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:47,119
for Q&amp;A so I'd like to uh introduce our

65
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:48,959
panelists here it seems like many of

66
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,319
them are already well known in the

67
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:53,959
industry but uh we we have Nathaniel

68
00:02:51,318 --> 00:02:56,079

69
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:58,439

till the

76
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:18,039
end what we're going to do throughout

77
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:19,919
this particularly if the Q&amp;A gets out of

78
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:22,639
hand is I like to because I'm a social

79
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:24,000
media influencer I like to follow tweets

80
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:26,518
right so I've got collected some good

81
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,158
ones that ask questions from uh

82
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:32,480
regarding the prop 64 but one of one of

83
00:03:30,158 --> 00:03:35,438
local news reporters in San Francisco

84
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:39,039
did an online Twitter poll uh Janna

85
00:03:35,438 --> 00:03:42,438
kataya she's the news reporter for K tvu

86
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:46,318
TV and you know simply should California

87
00:03:42,438 --> 00:03:48,759
voters approve prop 64 hashtag and men

88
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:51,518
make recreational marijuana use legal in

89
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:54,399
California so the Tweet closes in the

90
00:03:51,519 --> 00:04:00,719
next 5 hours it has 1,200 fotes and what

91
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:06,158
it's what it's tracking is 71% yes 18 %

92
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:08,479
no and 11% are unsure uh on on a kind of

93
00:04:06,158 --> 00:04:11,199
national level you have California

94
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:16,719
counts recently published their forecast

95
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:18,399
at 71% yes 26% no 3% undecided uh USC

96
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:24,840
the LA Times it's a little bit lower

97
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:28,120
it's 58% yes 34% no and 8% undecided so

for about six and a half years I got

120
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,400
when I got laid off in 2009 is when I

121
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,840
became a patient got me off about nine

122
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:29,719
prescription pills a day uh that got me

123
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:31,879
into activism um I was a rightwing home

124
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:33,960
School pastor's kid and my parents were

125
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:35,719
like right-wing activists growing up um

126
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:38,879
so from you know pro-life issues to

127
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:42,919
adoption issues to some guy made the

128
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:44,918
mistake of selling my mom's friend a a a

129
00:05:42,918 --> 00:05:46,519
sewing machine once it didn't give her

130
00:05:44,918 --> 00:05:49,240
the money back when it broke and my mom

131
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:53,000
organized a twoe protest of this guy's

132
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:54,280
store at which time so this so we were

133
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,918
activists we were always getting

134
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:57,799
involved I mean I saw my dad take a can

135
00:05:55,918 --> 00:06:00,719
of Mace to the face at one point you

136
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:02,319
know during during his time and

137
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,919
I was always raised up where you see an

138
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:07,199
injustice you you speak out and so

139
00:06:04,918 --> 00:06:09,159
that's what I did I still got involved I

140
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:11,520
started by organizing the my first group

141
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:14,599
was the UB County growers association in

142
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:16,439
2011 that went on for a year after that

143
00:06:14,598 --> 00:06:19,038
I had an attorney call me that I worked

144
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:21,240
with and basically said you know Nate we

145
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:22,959
kind of need what you did in Yuba County

146
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:25,879
at the state level he goes I a client in

147

everywhere what do we need I'm like well

149
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:31,519
you you need a trade Association there's

150
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,280
literally empty parking space for trade

151
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:35,079
group at the state capital we goes what

152
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:37,000

he goes that sounds good what do we do

155
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:45,079
said all figured out the next day I

156
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:47,840
Google searched how do you start a trade

157
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:51,758

later here I am so we now work now now

159
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:55,360
on that level we are we have endorsed

160
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:57,639
prop 64 we were one of the first groups

161
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,240
to come out and endorse or industry

162
00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:01,840
groups to come out and endorse it uh

163
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,400
largely because there how many members

164
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:09,719

172
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:28,478
California Cannabis industry Association

173
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:31,400

primarily in Sacramento know um I was

homeschooled uh radical uh Nate and I

actually have more in common you know

179
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:44,918
same uh sense of justice uh when I used

180
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:47,720
to be a rapper in uh my college Years my

181
00:07:44,918 --> 00:07:51,038
MC name in fact was Justice um I feel

182
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:55,199
very firmly about the need to YouTube

183
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:56,959
yeah of course um dare you to find it um

184
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,038
California growers association has grow

185
00:07:56,959 --> 00:08:01,598
grown quite rapidly I took the helm uh

186
00:07:59,038 --> 00:08:03,120
in summer of 2014 about two years ago we

187
00:08:01,598 --> 00:08:06,038
had about 60 members at the time we have

188
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,478
about 750 members now we are brought

189
00:08:06,038 --> 00:08:09,279
together by a recognition that

190
00:08:07,478 --> 00:08:11,800
California is a very unique cannabis

191
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:13,638
Marketplace our metric of success will

192
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:15,639
be the number of business licenses

193
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:17,918
issued the more independently owned

194
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:20,120
businesses there are the more criminals

195
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:22,560
we have turned into business owners our

196
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:24,840
fundamental work is to remove that veil

197
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,120
of criminality just because I grew up a

198
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:29,719
grower child of grower it does not make

199
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,360
me any less than anyone else and I

200
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:34,120
certainly grew up feeling that it did I

201
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:36,200
grew up ashamed afraid lying and feeling

202
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:37,759
very inferior I know that our community

203
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,640
and a lot of us around the state feel

204
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:41,958
those things and so our work is really

205
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:45,039
focused on ensuring that California has

206
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:46,439
the most opportunity possible we come at

207
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:48,439
this from a very small business

208
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:51,480
perspective our work is definitely

209
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:53,800
slanted toward the cottage subsistence

210
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:56,159
microenterprise really focused on uring

211
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:58,039
that small businesses and the most small

212
00:08:56,159 --> 00:09:00,120
businesses possible have the opportunity

213
00:08:58,039 --> 00:09:03,879
to participate this is is critical

214
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:06,039
because California has 50,000 or more

215
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:08,360
small businesses We Exist we're real

216
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:09,799
humans and we need to take that into

217
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:13,079
account as we move forward our

218
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:14,838
organization is neutral with concerns um

219
00:09:13,078 --> 00:09:17,000
our membership is pretty evenly divided

220
00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:18,839
on the question of prop 64 and what I'm

221
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,399
here to tell you today is that we are

222
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:22,240
maintaining our neutrality because

223
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:25,399
Wednesday November 9th we still need

224
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,959
each other we cannot afford to squander

225
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:28,559
The Good Will and good faith that we

226
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:30,518

ancestors were rappers I just did not

236
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:58,800
inherit the

237
00:09:56,039 --> 00:10:00,639
talent um so my name is Amanda Ryman I

238
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:02,958
am the manager of marijuana law and

239
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:04,559
policy for the drug policy Alliance and

240
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:07,599
we are one of the major supporters of

241
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:09,518
prop 64 um I work in our Oakland office

242
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,639
but we're a National Organization so

243
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:14,480
we're based in New York City we have

244
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:17,078
offices in Washington DC New Jersey

245
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,920
Colorado New Mexico and two in

246
00:10:17,078 --> 00:10:21,039
California one down in Southern

247
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:23,519
California and um our office of legal

248
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:25,319
affairs up in Northern California our

249
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:28,440
organization has a platform of three

250
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:30,800
issues one being mass incarceration so

251
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:32,560
impacting sent s in reform the number of

252
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:34,879
people that go to jail why they go to

253
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:37,439
jail how long they're in jail the second

254
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:39,919
is harm reduction so overdose prevention

255
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,680
which is especially Salient today with

256
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:44,319
the amount of Overdose we're seeing on

257
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:46,479
prescription opiates and then thirdly is

258
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,440
cannabis reform so it's one of the three

259
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,839
issues we work on but it's not our only

260
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:53,279
issue and the what we see weaving its

261
00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:55,160
way through all three of those areas are

262
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:57,159
issues related to racial and social

263
00:10:55,159 --> 00:10:59,559
justice and so when we look at

264
00:10:57,159 --> 00:11:01,278
legalization in California we're looking

265
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:03,518
at it through the lens of people getting

266
00:11:01,278 --> 00:11:05,720
in trouble for marijuana activity

267
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:07,399
wanting to prevent that from happening

268
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:09,600
but also wanting to prevent the

269
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:12,360
ramifications of having a criminal

270
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:15,120
record as it pertains to Opportunities

271
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:18,079
down the line we recognize that we have

272
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:20,639
had a gray area industry in California

273
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:22,799
for two decades and an elicit industry

274
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:25,480
for many many many many many decades

275
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:27,278
besides that so we have a situation

276
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:30,360
where we're transitioning people from

277
00:11:27,278 --> 00:11:32,078
elicit to Legal Behavior and we have to

278
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:34,360
ensure that people that have had

279
00:11:32,078 --> 00:11:36,000
criminal histories people that have had

280
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:38,079
um involvement with the criminal justice

281
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,360
system are not prevented from taking

282
00:11:38,078 --> 00:11:41,638
advantage of this new industry and so

283
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:43,278
you know when we talk about what we

284
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:45,278
would like to see in the future we need

285
00:11:43,278 --> 00:11:48,120
to ensure that the opportunity that's

286
00:11:45,278 --> 00:11:50,720
provided by prop 64 by allowing people

287
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:52,720
with drug felonies to be in the industry

288
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,959
and to get licenses in the industry and

289
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:57,040
for people's records to get expunged

290
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:59,479
that this happens and that we hold the

291
00:11:57,039 --> 00:12:01,679
state accountable for making sure that

292
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:03,839
this industry does not look like every

293
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:09,159
other other industry in America

294
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:09,160
primarily run by no offense white men

295
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:14,879
yes getting into this industry in the

296
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,839
last couple weeks I've never if you

297
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:18,759
remove some of the outliners the ones

298
00:12:16,839 --> 00:12:20,240
are you know yeah we want to pass

299
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:21,958
legalization no matter what it looks

300
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,799
like and on the other end If you

301
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:26,759
eliminate some that are vly just against

302
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:28,919
it no matter what you really get in the

303
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:31,799
middle that we're all kind of marching

304
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:33,198
right towards this uh the same okay yes

305
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:34,639
we'd really like to see it legalized and

306
00:12:33,198 --> 00:12:37,838
I also haven't met anybody that says

307
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:39,959
that this this prop 64 uh is written

308
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:42,199
perfectly I haven't seen somebody that

309
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:44,159
that's told me that uh so what we want

310
00:12:42,198 --> 00:12:47,479
to do is take a look at well then if we

311
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:49,958
remove that again what would this

312
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:52,320
industry look like in its most

313
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:54,599
prosperous kind of condition 10 years

314
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,399
from now now speaking to a lot of people

315
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:59,759
I came

316
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:02,600
across a set of recommend a from

317
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:05,759
California normal the position of this

318
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:08,000
organization is neutral but the position

319
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:10,198
of normal at a federal level understand

320
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,078
is for prop 64 and I think this is a

321
00:13:10,198 --> 00:13:15,240
good and and and I in no way endorse

322
00:13:13,078 --> 00:13:16,759
these they're just a set of questions I

323
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:18,879
out to me kind of pertinent so we'll go

324
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:21,519
through each one of them and begin those

325
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:24,720
as talking points because in this you

326
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:27,440
know in this kind of

327
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:29,560
2026 view of the California Cannabis

328
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,880
economy what are the how do these

329
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:34,958
considerations play so the first of

330
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:36,958
their 10 is decriminalization

331
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:39,518
decriminalized possession of more than

332
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:41,759
one ounce of

333
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:43,879
marijuana so where are we at I know

334
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:46,639
you've got 2 ounces on you so I don't

335
00:13:43,879 --> 00:13:49,559
know if we should even begin

336
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:51,440
with why don't we go ahead Amanda uh

337
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:52,758
well absolutely you know I would say

338
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,759
that one of the things we want to

339
00:13:52,759 --> 00:13:57,639
continue to do is push back on the

340
00:13:54,759 --> 00:13:59,480
criminal penalties for cannabis activity

341
00:13:57,639 --> 00:14:01,959
um they're going to be inflated they're

342
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:03,879
way inflated now because of fears and

343
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:05,758
misperceptions about cannabis we're

344
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:07,519
trying to dial that back as much as the

345
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:09,199
public is willing to go at this point

346
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:10,799
which is actually quite a bit given

347
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:13,198
where we are now versus where we were

348
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:15,120
even 5 years ago but I think we need to

349
00:14:13,198 --> 00:14:17,198
continue to look at who gets in trouble

350
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,720
for cannabis and we need to continue to

351
00:14:17,198 --> 00:14:21,198
push back even further but the key is is

352
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:23,240
that as a lot of you probably know

353
00:14:21,198 --> 00:14:25,639
working in this industry when people

354
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:27,759
make up their minds based on emotion

355
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:29,799
it's really hard to argue with them that

356
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:32,120
their emotion is wrong and that their

357
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:34,039
feeling is wrong and we saw this with

358
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:35,759
medical cannabis a lot of what turned

359
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:38,559
people's perceptions around on medical

360
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:40,680
cannabis was personal experience it was

361
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:42,958
seeing a family member use it or using

362
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:45,599
it themselves or someone they admired

363
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:47,679
was using it and so then the belief of

364
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,320
punishment associated with that behavior

365
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:52,120
started to dissipate because their

366
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:54,720
feelings about it started to change so

367
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:56,959
once cannabis is more out in the open

368
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:59,720
once it becomes more normalized The

369
00:14:56,958 --> 00:15:03,198
public's fear of six plan plant versus

370
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:05,879
10 plants or 1 o versus 4 o is going to

371
00:15:03,198 --> 00:15:08,078
start to seem pretty arbitrary right now

372
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:10,120
it's an inflated fear that we have to

373
00:15:08,078 --> 00:15:12,239
deal with but it's not something that we

374
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:14,039
have to accept is 1 oce then a good

375
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,879
starting point that's where the public

376
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:17,639
is at and and it's interesting because

377
00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:19,240
the public doesn't they again because

378
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:21,120
they're reactionary I'll give you I'll

379
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:23,720
give an example from like way when we

380
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,560
started polling on this issue and we ask

381
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:28,000
the public if they would be okay with

382
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:29,559
someone having 8 ounces or if they would

383
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,639
be okay with someone having one pound

384
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:31,879
like these were kind of like how do you

385
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:33,720
feel about this amount how do you feel

386
00:15:31,879 --> 00:15:36,679
about this amount more people were okay

387
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:38,839
with a pound than 8 O because one is

388
00:15:36,679 --> 00:15:42,120
less than

389
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:44,600
eight and it didn't make sense right it

390
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:46,799
didn't make sense but to the public

391
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:50,480
they're reacting they're like oh I want

392
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:53,318
them to have one marijuana not eight

393
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,959
marijuanas so so that's what that's

394
00:15:53,318 --> 00:15:56,360
where that is that is where that's what

395
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:58,278
we're getting from that and again you

396
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:00,000
know one uh the executive director of

397
00:15:58,278 --> 00:16:01,958
DPA who you all heard yesterday Ethan

398
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,480
nlman is very fond of saying

399
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:05,239
legalization is for people who love

400
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:07,519
marijuana hate marijuana and don't give

401
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:09,519
a shit about marijuana and so we have to

402
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,879
consider them because it's not just

403
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:13,078
people who love marijuana that are

404
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:14,759
voting on the initiative right it's

405
00:16:13,078 --> 00:16:16,198
people who have never used marijuana or

406
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:19,318
people who have but have kids and are

407
00:16:16,198 --> 00:16:22,159
scared um so we have to that that's

408
00:16:19,318 --> 00:16:24,000
that's kind of the all right Nathan real

409
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:26,000
quick um real quick i' just like to say

410
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,720
most likely we're going to say yes to

411
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,839
that entire list th those are all good

412
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:32,759
ideas um but I'd like it's not so much

413
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:35,639
are they good ideas it's like is there

414
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:37,560
an ideal you know solution out there

415
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:39,039
well yeah the ideal solution is that

416
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:40,799
it's just treated like every other you

417
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:42,879
know every other herb out there I mean

418
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:44,159
sure that's the ideal solution I mean I

419
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:45,919
mean when was the last time law

420
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:48,240
enforcement had

421
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:50,759
had you know when was the last time law

422
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,480
enforcement had had had had an opinion

423
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:55,240
on a bill sponsored by the California

424
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:57,159
almond Farmers Association you know it's

425
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:59,759
not it's it's a non-issue people don't

426
00:16:57,159 --> 00:17:01,919
think about it and so sure I think we do

427
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:05,038
want to go up but in from my perspective

428
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:06,318
honestly you know legalizing one gr

429
00:17:05,038 --> 00:17:09,199
right off the

430
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:10,678
bat it's acceptable I mean we have to

431
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:13,759
start somewhere and the reality is the

432
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:16,000
second you even legalize a gram the

433
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:17,599
protections you have from you know odor

434
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,119
law enforcement can't get into your car

435
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:22,198
anymore I remember when I was working on

436
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:23,918
Prop 19 in 2010 um one of the narcs I

437
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:26,360
worked with called me up and was just

438
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:28,280
like we kind of and they used to whisper

439
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:29,558
on the phone cuz like I was weird they

440
00:17:28,279 --> 00:17:31,519
be like all right

441
00:17:29,558 --> 00:17:33,720
I I support what you're doing but you're

442
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:36,200
going to fuck it up for all of us cuz

443
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:38,360
once we lose odor we lose everything and

444
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:40,240
that's the reality and so we need to

445
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:42,079
start somewhere and taking away a tool

446
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,120
they use to get into our cars to go

447
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:45,879
after minorities to go after people it's

448
00:17:44,119 --> 00:17:47,639
going to be key and then we can move on

449
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:49,360
from there but we have to start

450
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:51,000
somewhere and so that was so we're

451
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:53,000
agreement here it looks like that that

452
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,079
was the starting point

453
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,440
Hezekiah yeah there's no limit on how

454
00:17:55,079 --> 00:17:57,839
many 12 facts you can buy there

455
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:59,400
shouldn't be a limit on how many ounces

456
00:17:57,839 --> 00:18:01,639
you can buy

457
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,640
that's

458
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:08,960
it their second consideration is uh is

459
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,159
of course remove cannabis from the state

460
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:13,360
list of controlled

461
00:18:11,159 --> 00:18:15,320
substances is that an

462
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:17,240
imperative

463
00:18:15,319 --> 00:18:20,359
Nate

464
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:23,759
um that's helpful but until it gets

465
00:18:20,359 --> 00:18:25,678
descheduled at the at the at the federal

466
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:28,480
level okay anything done at the state

467
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:30,679
level to remove it um from the the the

468
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:34,360
state Controlled Substances Act will

469
00:18:30,679 --> 00:18:36,038
will more will more likely be a um a um

470
00:18:34,359 --> 00:18:37,639
trying to think of the word symbolic

471
00:18:36,038 --> 00:18:40,200
yeah uh

472
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:43,720
symbolic gester

473
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:45,279
okay uh yeah I'll I'll briefly agree um

474
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:48,640
though I'll take the opportunity to

475
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:50,599
caution against rescheduling let's not

476
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:55,559
go down in the controlled substances

477
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:55,558
list let's deschedule not resu

478
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:06,319
Amanda yeah DPA position is the

479
00:19:04,038 --> 00:19:07,839
descheduling of cannabis at the federal

480
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:11,079
level

481
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:13,439
okay there third consideration is to

482
00:19:11,079 --> 00:19:15,918
forbid local banss on deliveries of

483
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,840
cannabis from licensed providers to

484
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:20,240
qualified

485
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:22,079
individuals so to clarify right we have

486
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,960
that enabled currently from medical

487
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:26,038
medical marijuana users where

488
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:27,840
dispensaries um either aren't brick and

489
00:19:26,038 --> 00:19:31,400
mortar or they just prefer to have

490
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:33,519
delivery in place um so this was left

491
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:36,200
out of

492
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:39,079
648 um well what it is is localities

493
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:40,600
have the ability to ban cannabis

494
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:42,439
activity from within their borders they

495
00:19:40,599 --> 00:19:44,480
have the right to ban commercial medical

496
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:46,279
cannabis activity and if 64 passes

497
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,798
they'll have the right to ban commercial

498
00:19:46,279 --> 00:19:50,519
adult use activity what we're thinking

499
00:19:48,798 --> 00:19:53,079
about are people that live in those

500
00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:55,119
areas that want to order cannabis via

501
00:19:53,079 --> 00:19:57,480
delivery from places in surrounding

502
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:59,639
cities and counties where it is allowed

503
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:02,279
and have those deliveries made into

504
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:04,840
their County that's a dry county now in

505
00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:06,200
reality policing that is difficult

506
00:20:04,839 --> 00:20:07,639
especially if you have an unmarked

507
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,480
vehicle because it's like trying to

508
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:12,120
police Uber or trying to police food

509
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:15,079
deliveries but the reality is is it's

510
00:20:12,119 --> 00:20:18,158
one more way that we need to ensure that

511
00:20:15,079 --> 00:20:20,119
particularly patients have access even

512
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:22,880
though localities have that ability to

513
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:25,000
ban now prop 64 does not allow

514
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:28,200
localities to ban the personal indoor

515
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,798
cultivation of six plants for adults um

516
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:32,919
and so that is one point of access but

517
00:20:30,798 --> 00:20:34,960
we really want to try to ensure that

518
00:20:32,919 --> 00:20:37,000
given this local control framework that

519
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,880
we still have as many ways for people

520
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,558
who live in those jurisdictions to have

521
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:45,440
access to what they need okay anybody

522
00:20:41,558 --> 00:20:48,240
else having a a different perspective on

523
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:51,360
that number four is increased tax breaks

524
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:53,000
for qualified medical marijuana patients

525
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:56,079
how do you see that taking

526
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,798
form go ahead um I'll say that yeah

527
00:20:56,079 --> 00:21:00,879
there are really four policy

528
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:02,798
considerations that our membership has

529
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:06,120
uh concerns with and and taxes are

530
00:21:02,798 --> 00:21:09,440
certainly one of those uh policy

531
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:12,599
considerations um The Proposition as

532
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:14,320
filed is largely uh a cut and paste of

533
00:21:12,599 --> 00:21:16,158
two pieces of legislation that were

534
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:17,519
introduced at the end of the legislative

535
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:20,480
session in

536
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:22,158
2015 um those bills were reintroduced in

537
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,120
the beginning of the 26 legislative

538
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:27,720
session and through the course of about

539
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:30,199
a dozen legislative hearings that policy

540
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:32,159
evolved tremendously in including the

541
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:33,919
specific provision that you point to

542
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:35,840
which is um at the time it was

543
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:37,679
exemptions for low-income patients I

544
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:39,599
think we probably all agree that we

545
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:41,720
would go further and exempt patients

546
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:43,439
entirely but there is more that we can

547
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:45,679
do on tax policy which is what we

548
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:49,038
learned in the legislative deliberation

549
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:50,640
um two key two key policy amendments

550
00:21:49,038 --> 00:21:52,558
that we were successful in advocating

551
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:56,000
for in the legislature that are not in

552
00:21:52,558 --> 00:21:58,000
prop 64 um first and foremost uh removal

553
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,798
of a leaf tax I've said this a number of

554
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,440
times to lot of you were not sure what

555
00:21:59,798 --> 00:22:03,319
Leaf is I've been growing all my life

556
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:05,080
and I still can't tell you what Leaf is

557
00:22:03,319 --> 00:22:07,240
or what the value of leaf is is that

558
00:22:05,079 --> 00:22:09,759
water Leaf is that trim is that shake a

559
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:12,159
flat rate value tax across the board for

560
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:14,960
products of that variable value is going

561
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:16,840
to be very problematic um and so you

562
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,558
know we we were able to replace the leaf

563
00:22:16,839 --> 00:22:20,558
tax in the legislation with a

564
00:22:18,558 --> 00:22:22,759
manufactured product tax don't tax the

565
00:22:20,558 --> 00:22:24,798
product going into the process tax the

566
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:27,079
homogeneous product coming out where you

567
00:22:24,798 --> 00:22:28,519
can actually establish that so uh

568
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:30,720
secondly we were able to suc

569
00:22:28,519 --> 00:22:33,119
successfully advocate for a tiered tax

570
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,880
rate where specialty producers would uh

571
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:36,798
the smallest producers would be SP

572
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,799
paying a lower rate and the largest

573
00:22:36,798 --> 00:22:40,679
producers would be paying a higher rate

574
00:22:38,798 --> 00:22:43,000
again you know what our bias is our bias

575
00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:44,919
is to as many small businesses possible

576
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,278
creating a Marketplace that provides a

577
00:22:44,919 --> 00:22:47,880
Level Playing Field through a

578
00:22:46,278 --> 00:22:50,038
progressive tax rate is very important

579
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:52,520
to us this is one of those places where

580
00:22:50,038 --> 00:22:54,400
you know I think prop 64 simply suffered

581
00:22:52,519 --> 00:22:56,519
from the you know the how quickly we

582
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,960
moved we didn't have the opportunity to

583
00:22:56,519 --> 00:23:01,000
do six months of policy deliberation

584
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,798
um but we we certainly hope that

585
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,640
everyone will work together to ensure

586
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:08,200
that that those tax Provisions are

587
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:10,320
changed if prop 64 is

588
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:11,519
successful anyone else have a different

589
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:15,960
perspective on

590
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:17,839
that okay um of the of the 10 kind of

591
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:19,400
recommendations those were you know kind

592
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:20,558
of the four that I found most

593
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:22,559
interesting the rest of them can be

594
00:23:20,558 --> 00:23:25,079
found on their on the website for

595
00:23:22,558 --> 00:23:27,319
California normal I wanted to pull up

596
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:29,798
and just get before we open it up to

597
00:23:27,319 --> 00:23:32,720
audience Q&amp;A which I know you're all

598
00:23:29,798 --> 00:23:34,720
eager for um there's some quotes or

599
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:38,200
tweets that I've come across and ask

600
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:40,679
kind of your your perspective so um

601
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:43,720
Reuters recently reported that the

602
00:23:40,679 --> 00:23:48,240
Mexican president Enrique Pena stated

603
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:50,240
that if prop 64 is past Mexico may

604
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:54,919
follow what are your thoughts on that

605
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:58,919
anybody who's passion but go first

606
00:23:54,919 --> 00:24:01,080
that's that's awesome

607
00:23:58,919 --> 00:24:03,559
okay well no I mean the reality is is

608
00:24:01,079 --> 00:24:05,278
elaborate I mean I I can elaborate

609
00:24:03,558 --> 00:24:06,678
briefly and then they can to for I mean

610
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:08,558
I mean that's exactly why are we're

611
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:10,880
doing this in the very first place

612
00:24:08,558 --> 00:24:13,038
California leads the nation in a lot of

613
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:15,039
ways and not only will I mean I believe

614
00:24:13,038 --> 00:24:16,599
we you'll see it change in Mexico but

615
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:18,798
you'll see it change in in many of the

616
00:24:16,599 --> 00:24:21,000
other I mean North American countries

617
00:24:18,798 --> 00:24:22,839
and South American countries as well

618
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,440
because we do we mean we we are the

619
00:24:22,839 --> 00:24:28,678
sixth largest economy in the world so we

620
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:30,519
will set the the stage uh for the of the

621
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:33,440
world on on how to do it and hopefully

622
00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:35,079
how how how how to do it right now

623
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,519
Playing devil's advocate here and we'll

624
00:24:35,079 --> 00:24:40,119
keep this this conversation going right

625
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:41,720
um just like Betty e just said uh

626
00:24:40,119 --> 00:24:44,239
opponents are going to be looking for

627
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:46,679
missteps so now we're talking about

628
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:48,399
International maybe opponents too we're

629
00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:50,798
being under we're looking we're being

630
00:24:48,398 --> 00:24:52,158
looked at under a global microscope and

631
00:24:50,798 --> 00:24:54,879
the implications so don't they become

632
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:56,240
more severe is the more at risk for 64

633
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,559
well we already are under a global

634
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:00,079
microscope I mean California like said

635
00:24:58,558 --> 00:25:02,278
is the sixth largest economy in the

636
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:03,759
world um you know we're innovators a lot

637
00:25:02,278 --> 00:25:06,240
of stuff that happens in the world

638
00:25:03,759 --> 00:25:07,440
happens here first um so I think you

639
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,079
know when we talk about the

640
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,519
international implications we're really

641
00:25:09,079 --> 00:25:14,000
talking about is pressure on the UN

642
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:16,038
treaty um on drug abuse signed back in

643
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,960
the 1960s by a whole smattering of

644
00:25:16,038 --> 00:25:20,919
countries it said that no country on the

645
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:22,600
list would legalize any illegal drug for

646
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:24,240
any reason except for medicine and

647
00:25:22,599 --> 00:25:26,519
Science and if they did they would have

648
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:28,480
un sanctions placed against them so the

649
00:25:26,519 --> 00:25:29,960
idea that marijuana isn't legal anywhere

650
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:33,000
in the world because everyone in the

651
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:34,720
world hates marijuana is not true the

652
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,480
reason marijuana is only legal in

653
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,038
Uruguay which became the first country

654
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:40,200
to challenge the treaty is because they

655
00:25:38,038 --> 00:25:42,278
don't want to be sanctioned by the UN

656
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:44,038
and the United States is a bully and I

657
00:25:42,278 --> 00:25:45,720
know because DPA works with these

658
00:25:44,038 --> 00:25:47,558
countries internationally and they do

659
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:49,519
want to change their drug laws and we're

660
00:25:47,558 --> 00:25:51,558
the ones that withhold funding our

661
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:54,440
National Institute on drug abuse funds

662
00:25:51,558 --> 00:25:56,158
90% of the world's drug research a lot

663
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:57,558
of folks do not want to rock the boat

664
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:59,760
with us and we're saying that if you

665
00:25:57,558 --> 00:26:01,519
legalize C Canabis we're not going to be

666
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:04,359
your friends anymore I mean it really is

667
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:06,240
that silly and juvenile uay became the

668
00:26:04,359 --> 00:26:08,119
first country to do it and despite what

669
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:10,720
we said and now it looks like Canada is

670
00:26:08,119 --> 00:26:12,918
going to move forward that as well so if

671
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:14,720
California legalizes what we're going to

672
00:26:12,919 --> 00:26:16,679
have is a smattering of Latin American

673
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:19,720
countries with economies that are way

674
00:26:16,679 --> 00:26:21,919
smaller than ours who have experienced

675
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:23,960
unbelievable damage and death at the

676
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:25,880
hands of the War on Drugs that is now

677
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:27,840
going to be able to go to the UN and say

678
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:30,919
hey the sixth largest economy in the

679
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:32,639
world legalized pot why can't we and

680
00:26:30,919 --> 00:26:34,759
believe me Mexico is thinking about it

681
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:37,159
and they're not the only ones so this

682
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:39,200
has implications for California sure but

683
00:26:37,159 --> 00:26:40,278
the implications for South America and

684
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,480
other countries that have been

685
00:26:40,278 --> 00:26:44,359
completely ravaged by the drug war it

686
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,038
becomes even more of a human rights

687
00:26:44,359 --> 00:26:49,639
issue than it is here in the United

688
00:26:46,038 --> 00:26:49,640
States in some ways those

689
00:26:53,319 --> 00:26:57,839
countries those countries have also been

690
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:59,798
ravaged by economic consolidation and

691
00:26:57,839 --> 00:27:03,119
the econ economic Injustice of of

692
00:26:59,798 --> 00:27:06,359
corporate focused uh globalization

693
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:10,678
unfortunately we're not comparing prop

694
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:12,678
64 to Prohibition it's not go to jail or

695
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:15,759
not we're in a gray area California

696
00:27:12,679 --> 00:27:17,159
already has very Progressive policies on

697
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:18,278
this subject matter we've been leading

698
00:27:17,159 --> 00:27:21,320
the way since

699
00:27:18,278 --> 00:27:23,159
1996 the economic Justice element of

700
00:27:21,319 --> 00:27:25,759
this conversation is one that's easy to

701
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:28,520
overlook particularly in politics where

702
00:27:25,759 --> 00:27:31,000
budgets make campaigns the fact of the

703
00:27:28,519 --> 00:27:33,200
matter is that cannabis is a very unique

704
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,079
crop and here in California we have a

705
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:38,480
very unique community of farmers that

706
00:27:35,079 --> 00:27:40,480
are producing it the social and economic

707
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:43,120
and cultural benefits derived from

708
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:46,360
economically viable small-scale Family

709
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:48,199
Farms is a tremendous Bull workk against

710
00:27:46,359 --> 00:27:49,959
the injustices that some of these very

711
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:53,440
same countries that we are facing have

712
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:55,960
dealt with and preserving those values

713
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:57,759
is very important from our perspective

714
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:59,399
um unfortunately the current regulatory

715
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:01,759
framework work for Medical is

716
00:27:59,398 --> 00:28:04,079
significantly more protective of those

717
00:28:01,759 --> 00:28:06,679
interests um shifting gears though I

718
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:09,199
also want to say that you know I I I I

719
00:28:06,679 --> 00:28:10,720
didn't support Prop 19 um we're neutral

720
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:14,360
here so you know we've made some

721
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:16,200
progress um they told us the same things

722
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:18,599
if you guys don't do it it'll be the end

723
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:20,159
of the world the train will stop moving

724
00:28:18,599 --> 00:28:21,639
the train didn't stop moving two years

725
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:23,399
later we saw two states we've seen

726
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:26,038
several States since we've seen several

727
00:28:23,398 --> 00:28:28,119
countries um we're we're not perceiving

728
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:30,359
the urgency the same way that some St

729
00:28:28,119 --> 00:28:32,719
stakeholders are this this boat has left

730
00:28:30,359 --> 00:28:34,278
the station could we speed it up sure

731
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,919
but I've made a lot of mistakes because

732
00:28:34,278 --> 00:28:37,880
I move too quickly through complicated

733
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:39,759
subject matter and so I just want to be

734
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:41,640
sure that we realize that public opinion

735
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:43,599
is not going back on this we're not

736
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:45,360
going to lose the ground that we've won

737
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:47,480
the tide is going to continue to move

738
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:50,000
forward and sometimes it's important to

739
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:51,759
take care to be mindful and to be very

740
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,038
mindful of the nuances because this is

741
00:28:51,759 --> 00:28:56,158
not a simple question there will be

742
00:28:54,038 --> 00:28:57,679
outcomes real people's lives will be

743
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:59,720
impacted by the different policy

744
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:02,000
decisions we make we didn't need to

745
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:03,839
write 64 Pages we could have done it

746
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,798
very or 62 we could have done this with

747
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:08,278
a lot less words we could have taken a

748
00:29:05,798 --> 00:29:10,558
more incremental phased approach there's

749
00:29:08,278 --> 00:29:13,319
no reason we needed this to be the

750
00:29:10,558 --> 00:29:15,918
Domino that fell let me get Nathan your

751
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:15,918
perspective in

752
00:29:18,038 --> 00:29:22,359
there but you have nothing want to stay

753
00:29:20,398 --> 00:29:23,798
on interational want to go well it's

754
00:29:22,359 --> 00:29:25,719
interesting actually Hezekiah it's great

755
00:29:23,798 --> 00:29:28,398
because you know one of the the

756
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:31,480
statements the LA Times editorial War

757
00:29:28,398 --> 00:29:34,239
and said the reality is that California

758
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:36,839
has already essentially legalized

759
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:39,038
marijuana to your point he it's just not

760
00:29:36,839 --> 00:29:40,319
true um it's a fun talking point but

761
00:29:39,038 --> 00:29:42,919
people still go to jail I mean we just

762
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:44,519
had a raid in Yolo County three days ago

763
00:29:42,919 --> 00:29:46,278
20% of my board members have had their

764
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:48,480
doors kicked in over the last year you

765
00:29:46,278 --> 00:29:50,119
know that's reality you know it's a fun

766
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,759
talking point to say oh it's pretty much

767
00:29:50,119 --> 00:29:53,599
legal now but it's just not true there

768
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:55,038
are still people in jail for it cops

769
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:57,038
still use the odor of it to get into

770
00:29:55,038 --> 00:29:58,640
people's cars they're still harassing

771
00:29:57,038 --> 00:30:00,480
people black people in brown people are

772
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:02,840
still being harassed on a daily basis

773
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:05,480
over the smell so it's not fair just to

774
00:30:02,839 --> 00:30:08,759
say that I just I I politely have to you

775
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:10,880
know two disagree and prop 64 was it was

776
00:30:08,759 --> 00:30:12,278
prop 64 was also the only initiative

777
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,240
that had small business protections

778
00:30:12,278 --> 00:30:15,679
cooked into it unlike all the other I

779
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,880
would quote you know more activist

780
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:18,159
initiatives or people would say

781
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,440
well-written initiatives which were just

782
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:22,600
an open market that had no protections

783
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:25,320
so they did take you know does it do

784
00:30:22,599 --> 00:30:26,879
everything people want no but I think it

785
00:30:25,319 --> 00:30:29,720
doesn't what it doesn't do is create for

786
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:31,320
example a 500,000 licensing fee which

787
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:32,720
would kill small business which they've

788
00:30:31,319 --> 00:30:34,240
done on East Coast which is a way if you

789
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,159
want to allow corporations that's what

790
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:39,519
you do and what you're saying is that it

791
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:41,240
does effectively legalize not what is

792
00:30:39,519 --> 00:30:43,278
essentially legalization which is what

793
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:45,319
they're saying here good any other

794
00:30:43,278 --> 00:30:47,240
matter well just to just on the you know

795
00:30:45,319 --> 00:30:49,439
marijuana is already legal in California

796
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:52,079
well I'll just say for for a white lady

797
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:54,798
living in Oakland marijuana pretty much

798
00:30:52,079 --> 00:30:56,599
is legal in California um but for people

799
00:30:54,798 --> 00:30:58,079
of color living even in Progressive

800
00:30:56,599 --> 00:31:00,480
places like Oakland where

801
00:30:58,079 --> 00:31:02,879
African-Americans make up 25% of our

802
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:05,319
population but 77% of those that get

803
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:07,480
citations for cannabis marijuana is

804
00:31:05,319 --> 00:31:09,638
definitely not legal and it's not legal

805
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:11,278
for the folks who have their kids taken

806
00:31:09,638 --> 00:31:13,359
away and it's not legal for the folks

807
00:31:11,278 --> 00:31:15,679
who are losing their jobs and this is

808
00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:17,879
very real um so just to give you some

809
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:19,880
information in the past 10 years okay

810
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:23,000
this the past decade in California we've

811
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:25,760
seen almost 500,000 felony arrests for

812
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,558
marijuana now a felony is not just you

813
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:30,480
go to jail and pay your time and get out

814
00:31:27,558 --> 00:31:32,960
a Fel felony is every job you apply for

815
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:35,480
every bank loan every housing

816
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:37,919
application you have to talk about that

817
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:40,038
felony and you're at risk of not getting

818
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:42,799
that benefit and that impacts not just

819
00:31:40,038 --> 00:31:45,038
you but your kids and your communities

820
00:31:42,798 --> 00:31:45,960
so again um you know I would never say

821
00:31:45,038 --> 00:31:47,638
that that there's not going to be

822
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:49,919
growing pains or that we're not going to

823
00:31:47,638 --> 00:31:52,519
have to be really really cognizant and

824
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:54,440
aware of how these policies land at the

825
00:31:52,519 --> 00:31:56,919
end of the day because that's why the

826
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:58,798
work continues and even ramps up on

827
00:31:56,919 --> 00:32:00,880
November 9th because now we have to

828
00:31:58,798 --> 00:32:04,038
create the kind of industry that we want

829
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:06,200
to see but at the same time we can't

830
00:32:04,038 --> 00:32:08,079
wait because every day people are

831
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:10,319
getting in trouble and every day someone

832
00:32:08,079 --> 00:32:12,278
else is losing the opportunity to move

833
00:32:10,319 --> 00:32:14,638
forward with their life and you know we

834
00:32:12,278 --> 00:32:17,278
did make marijuana from a misdemeanor to

835
00:32:14,638 --> 00:32:19,798
an infraction in 2011 and so the

836
00:32:17,278 --> 00:32:21,880
misdemeanor plummeted among adults and

837
00:32:19,798 --> 00:32:23,960
you know where that left us with our

838
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:26,440
misdemeanors in California 2third of

839
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:28,960
them being made up by miners so these

840
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:30,840
are kids 18 under 18 that are getting

841
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:34,159
misdemeanor records before they're even

842
00:32:30,839 --> 00:32:37,240
out of high school prop 64 eliminates

843
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:39,399
all jail time for minors for marijuana

844
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:42,000
activities and instead replaces it with

845
00:32:39,398 --> 00:32:44,678
counseling drug education and then it

846
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,159
destroys those records at age 18 these

847
00:32:44,679 --> 00:32:48,798
are benefits that we're going to see

848
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:50,278
November 9th at 12:01 a.m. and then

849
00:32:48,798 --> 00:32:52,200
we're all going to get to work so that

850
00:32:50,278 --> 00:32:54,159
we can ensure that the small businesses

851
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:55,759
do have a leg up and that we take this

852
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:58,159
culture that we've spent so long

853
00:32:55,759 --> 00:32:59,599
cultivating and bring it to the world

854
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:00,679
rather than let the world change who we

855
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:03,558
are which I don't think we're going to

856
00:33:00,679 --> 00:33:03,559
do

857
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:09,960
so just to speak briefly to the last

858
00:33:07,159 --> 00:33:12,320
decade of arrests there really is a a a

859
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:14,440
story that's OB fiscated by that

860
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:15,918
statistic which is the impact of the

861
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:18,519
policy change in

862
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:21,159
20101 we went from one of the more

863
00:33:18,519 --> 00:33:23,679
atrocious arrest rates in the nation at

864
00:33:21,159 --> 00:33:26,440
upwards of 80 to 100,000 arrests a year

865
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:28,399
to 20,000 or less for every year since

866
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:30,880
this is part of why we don't feel the

867
00:33:28,398 --> 00:33:32,798
urgency because we have seen a

868
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:34,799
comparable rate in the reduction of

869
00:33:32,798 --> 00:33:38,158
arrests that the states have legalized

870
00:33:34,798 --> 00:33:40,480
have um we don't have a good case study

871
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:43,919
for what happens when a state that has

872
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:45,960
our specific policy regime legalizes we

873
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:48,399
also don't have a good case study for

874
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:51,120
another Community or state that has the

875
00:33:48,398 --> 00:33:53,119
community of businesses we do we're not

876
00:33:51,119 --> 00:33:54,798
confident that as written the

877
00:33:53,119 --> 00:33:58,678
marketplace will provide enough

878
00:33:54,798 --> 00:34:00,918
opportunity for drug dealers like me

879
00:33:58,679 --> 00:34:02,679
to become small business owners and if

880
00:34:00,919 --> 00:34:06,000
we don't address that fundamental

881
00:34:02,679 --> 00:34:08,000
Injustice we probably missed the point

882
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,239
the the bottom line here of course is

883
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,280
that you know we are going to keep

884
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:13,519
working at it it's not a done deal we've

885
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:15,760
got a lot of work to do what frustrates

886
00:34:13,519 --> 00:34:17,759
me is that we did it wrong in the first

887
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:19,359
place we missed the point in the first

888
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:21,480
place we could have done better if we

889
00:34:19,358 --> 00:34:24,199
would have taken a little bit longer to

890
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:26,719
to Really articulate our outcomes and

891
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:31,519
ultimately unfortunately if campaign

892
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:31,519
donors weren't making policy decisions
