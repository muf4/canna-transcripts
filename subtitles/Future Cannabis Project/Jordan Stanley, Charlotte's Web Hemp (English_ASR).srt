[Music]

2
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:15,000
from the very beginning we started as

3
00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:17,118
indoor Growers and at that time we used

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,800
th000 watt high pressure sodium and

5
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:22,518
metal highlight

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:24,320
lights uh We've soon soon after you know

7
00:00:22,518 --> 00:00:28,079
building out a couple of indoor grows we

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:32,359
decided to use the Sun and move into

9
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:35,320
Greenhouse so we still use indoor lights

10
00:00:32,359 --> 00:00:39,479
but we've moved from th000 watt high

11
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:41,960
press sodiums to 200 watt L LED

12
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:45,319
lights and the difference has been

13
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:47,520
amazing if you take a light spectrum and

14
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:51,600
you put it under a 2,000 watt

15
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:54,440
light it's or or a 1,000 watt high-press

16
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:57,198
sodium it's off the charts as far as the

17
00:00:54,439 --> 00:00:59,518
lumens then you put that light put that

18
00:00:57,198 --> 00:01:03,640
same light spectrum under an LED light

19
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:06,079
and it shows up however a side by side

20
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:08,960
between a high press sodium and an LED

21
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:10,239
light is amazing so basically you're

22
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:12,759
getting the Spectrum you're getting a

23
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:16,719
full spectrum of the sun under some LED

24
00:01:12,759 --> 00:01:19,280
lights not all whereas the lumens aren't

25
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:21,319
as bright as a high press sodium but

26
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:24,960
kind of what we saw whenever we were

27
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:27,798
kind of you know testing to see if we

28
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:29,879
wanted to switch to an LED we did a side

29
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:33,600
by side we took plants the same genetic

30
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:37,118
IC that's looked identical in health

31
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:39,319
size and we put some under a high press

32
00:01:37,118 --> 00:01:41,478
sodium I mean this High Press sodium was

33
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:43,000
18 in off of these plants so they're

34
00:01:41,478 --> 00:01:45,959
getting the most intense light that we

35
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,040
could possibly give them they're 1,000

36
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:49,879
Watts they put off a tremendous amount

37
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:53,040
of heat so we have to duct them we have

38
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:56,478
to air cool them and then we had a LED

39
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,479
light a 200 watt LED light four or 5 ft

40
00:01:56,478 --> 00:02:00,118
over the plants they put off no heat

41
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:02,879
they don't have the lumens of high

42
00:02:00,118 --> 00:02:05,759
pressure sodium but for some reason

43
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:07,640
under we had uh under our LED light we

44
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,038
had plants that looked like outdoor

45
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:11,919
plants the leaves were bigger they were

46
00:02:10,038 --> 00:02:13,479
Greener they they didn't have as

47
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:16,679
stretchier or nodes of

48
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:17,878
growth and all because of the spectrum

49
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,040
so what we're learning is that it

50
00:02:17,878 --> 00:02:22,560
doesn't matter the intensity of of

51
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:26,439
lumens what matters is the spectrum of

52
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:28,560
light so all propagation is done indoor

53
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:31,759
all of our breeding operations are done

54
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,800
indoor and all of our R&amp;D plants so

55
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:36,039
we'll we'll take a bunch of different

56
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:38,319
genetics and basically just flower them

57
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:40,280
indoor so that we can test them so that

58
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:43,878
we can see what kind of terpenoids what

59
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:46,479
levels of THC what levels of CBD and

60
00:02:43,878 --> 00:02:49,000
eventually you know extend the research

61
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:50,759
on discovering new new canabo for

62
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,120
production we're either outdoor or we're

63
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:55,239
in Greenhouse we do have supplemental

64
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,200
Lighting in our green houses and

65
00:02:55,239 --> 00:02:59,239
ultimately all that does is extend the

66
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:01,280
photo period of vegetative state until

67
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:04,319
we're ready to flow so we want them to

68
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:06,280
veg to a certain size before before we

69
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:09,280
flower them out for many different

70
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:11,959
reasons uh right now we are moving into

71
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,598
LED lights for that because they don't

72
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:15,319
grow under that supplemental light

73
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:17,039
that's not what it's for it's just to

74
00:03:15,318 --> 00:03:19,759
keep it in a vegetative

75
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:23,359
state we are kind of phasing into LED

76
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:26,639
lights but it takes time LED light setup

77
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:30,200
is12 $1,300 where a high press sodium

78
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:31,919
setup is 200 bucks it's especially for

79
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:35,318
an indoor for a greenhouse

80
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:39,039
setting uh we are all 100% organic in

81
00:03:35,318 --> 00:03:41,598
our pesticides Colorado has has a list

82
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:44,479
of things that you can use and a no no

83
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:46,759
list of things that you cannot use so

84
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:50,039
everything that we use from from mold to

85
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:51,719
pesticide is 100% organic treatments one

86
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:54,078
of the products that we use that that

87
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:57,120
does wonders for spidermites and russet

88
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:59,480
mites is a product called Green Cleaner

89
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,519
it's on the the good list it's something

90
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:04,598
that can use it's something that you can

91
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:08,000
use on tomatoes and strawberries up to

92
00:04:04,598 --> 00:04:10,399
the day of harvest uh and then they're

93
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,680
they're pesticides that are on the No No

94
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,438
list that if you use even as a clone

95
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,199
doesn't matter if that that same clone

96
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:20,399
that you use this particular pesticide

97
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:22,720
it can grow 12T tall and it will still

98
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:25,079
show up in the final product the reason

99
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,199
why is because cannabis in general is

100
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:29,478
fibrous and especially when it grows

101
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:32,160
those flowers it's a sponge it holds on

102
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:35,199
to to everything and you can detect any

103
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:37,080
pesticide at any time of using we've

104
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,160
been messing around with drip systems

105
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:41,319
since the beginning and we finally found

106
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:43,280
one that we like and it's it's a slow

107
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:45,000
drip system and it doesn't work with big

108
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:47,879
pots and we've discovered that we can

109
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,079
grow with this particular drip system we

110
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:53,319
can grow 5 lb plants out of a 20 gallon

111
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:55,000
pot you know we've always thought the

112
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:56,839
bigger the pot the bigger the plants and

113
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,038
that was the way to be able to grow huge

114
00:04:56,839 --> 00:05:00,159
plants and have a great yield we're

115
00:04:59,038 --> 00:05:01,639
learning that it's a little bit

116
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,039
different whenever you can keep a steady

117
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:05,879
drip you not only save water you keep

118
00:05:04,038 --> 00:05:09,439
your microbic activity by keeping the

119
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:11,519
soil wet and you're constantly feeding

120
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:14,199
your plant ultimately the drip system

121
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:15,918
will save you 15 to 20% on your water

122
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:17,919
cuz it's a constant drip you don't have

123
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:20,439
any of the Overflow it's typically when

124
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:22,680
you hand water a pot you have overflow

125
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:24,279
you have drainage through the bottom and

126
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,600
that's a lot of that's all waste of

127
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:29,439
water with a drip system

128
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:31,960
you're you're not seeing all that excess

129
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:34,079
water so you're saving about 15 20% on

130
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:36,439
water through a drip system and you're

131
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:38,918
keeping it wet all the time a plant

132
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:40,759
doesn't like to go dry and then wet and

133
00:05:38,918 --> 00:05:42,959
then dry and then wet so you're keeping

134
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:45,360
a healthy medium and you're keeping

135
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:46,918
microbic activity in the soil which

136
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,919
overall gives you a better plant gives

137
00:05:46,918 --> 00:05:52,399
you a better yield and saving water on

138
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:54,799
top of it there are aeroponic systems

139
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:56,478
that grow pound plants and they

140
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,840
literally have the root structure of a

141
00:05:56,478 --> 00:06:00,359
1gallon pot and the reason why is

142
00:05:58,839 --> 00:06:01,879
because they're constant conly feeding

143
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,560
it they don't have to have the root

144
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:05,879
structure as long as they're uptaking

145
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:08,319
the nutrients that they need to grow

146
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:11,800
there's there's so much you can go into

147
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:13,639
with with the root structure I mean if

148
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:16,639
you're it depends on if you have three

149
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:18,680
plants and you have 60 gallon pots and

150
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:22,079
you want to grow huge plants you can do

151
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:24,000
that and you can grow huge plants and

152
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:26,719
and they will have the capability to do

153
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,038
that with such a huge pot and that much

154
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,919
soil but however you're not going to be

155
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:33,240
feeding them as continually as you could

156
00:06:30,918 --> 00:06:37,120
be in a smaller container we go through

157
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:39,280
a lot of water in in one day for right

158
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:42,519
around 1100 plants we go through about

159
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:45,879
1,800 gallons of water a day drip system

160
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:48,478
would take that to about 1100 12200

161
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:50,639
gallons so you're still you'd still be

162
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:52,879
going through the water but whenever you

163
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:55,360
hand water a plant and you have all that

164
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:57,800
drainage and it it's going out the sides

165
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,360
of a velvet pot you don't have that with

166
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:02,160
drip system it Conant absorbs you're

167
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:04,560
cutting out all that extra water that's

168
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:07,240
going to waste we get it through um

169
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:10,560
Hydro Gardens it's a it's a locally

170
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:13,720
owned shop that's outside of Colorado

171
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:16,319
Springs to move into a solar energy

172
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:18,199
energy saving system it takes time it's

173
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,400
not something you can just do overnight

174
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:23,120
as you as you know eventually we'd love

175
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:26,638
to to have solar but in order to have

176
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:29,240
solar and green energy it takes it takes

177
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:31,478
a good good amount of capital to to uh

178
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,879
to Implement those typ types of systems

179
00:07:31,478 --> 00:07:34,318
but it is something you're looking to

180
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:37,039
absolutely

181
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:40,598
absolutely uh we have something that we

182
00:07:37,038 --> 00:07:42,800
call a climate battery it's um some

183
00:07:40,598 --> 00:07:45,120
Growers have been using it for you know

184
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,639
tropical trees and green houses but

185
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,360
basically you dig a big hole and you put

186
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:52,519
a bunch of French drain in the ground

187
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:55,000
and you attach it to a bunch of uh uh

188
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:56,478
French drain like trying to think

189
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,439
irrigation tunnels that you would see

190
00:07:56,478 --> 00:08:00,560
under roads like the big plastic

191
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:02,918
corrugated pipes so you attach the

192
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,918
French strain to that and you have a big

193
00:08:02,918 --> 00:08:07,639
tube where you pull the heat of the air

194
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:09,318
from the greenhouse into these tubes and

195
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:11,639
it goes through the French drain you

196
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:13,960
have to insulate the ground first and on

197
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:16,439
the other side on the exhaust you get

198
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:19,079
cool air so you're pulling in hot air

199
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:21,240
bringing it into the ground the heat

200
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:23,198
exchanges in the ground and you get the

201
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:25,918
cool air so basically you're cooling

202
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:28,919
your greenh houses in the day and you're

203
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:31,399
turning your your Greenhouse pad into a

204
00:08:28,918 --> 00:08:33,399
heat pad and it saves us about 30% on

205
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:36,158
propane so the air exchanges in the

206
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:38,038
ground you have heat com into the ground

207
00:08:36,158 --> 00:08:40,038
everything is insulated on the ground

208
00:08:38,038 --> 00:08:42,679
what you have coming out is is it feels

209
00:08:40,038 --> 00:08:44,919
like air conditioned air well however

210
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:46,479
that heat is trapped in the ground and

211
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:47,958
that seeps up at night so basically

212
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,600
you're turning your Greenhouse pad into

213
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:53,879
a heat pad it's insulated on the bottom

214
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:57,040
and on the sides so that heat has

215
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:58,480
nowhere to go but up so cuz the cold

216
00:08:57,039 --> 00:09:00,159
ground below if you don't have that

217
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,399
insulated will pull all that heat down

218
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:05,480
into the Earth through

219
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:07,000
conduction so this uh with the

220
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:09,000
insulation is the only way that this

221
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,078
will work I mean you can still cool your

222
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,799
Greenhouse just fine you know you're

223
00:09:11,078 --> 00:09:14,559
exch you're basically just exchanging

224
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:16,719
the heat in the ground when you're

225
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:19,759
insulated that heat has nowhere to go

226
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:21,120
but up so and it's from what we from

227
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:24,000
what we can tell before we had this

228
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:27,120
climate battery we're we're saving about

229
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,639
about 30% on propan which is still a big

230
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,159
number but we're also cooling our

231
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:32,439
Greenhouse in the day

232
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:35,838
our green our Greenhouse that doesn't

233
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:39,640
have the climate battery is consistently

234
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:40,839
about 8 to 10° warmer all the time so

235
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:43,879
it's a big

236
00:09:40,839 --> 00:09:46,760
difference all for the price of running

237
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:50,278
for fans and how long ago did you

238
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:52,799
implement that about four years ago so

239
00:09:50,278 --> 00:09:54,879
and we have not built any other greenh

240
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:57,199
houses after that but any any other

241
00:09:54,879 --> 00:10:00,120
Greenhouse that we build will have a

242
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:02,399
climate battery and to put it in

243
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:05,078
perspective we have a indicia greenhouse

244
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:07,000
and a sativa Greenhouse in our indicia

245
00:10:05,078 --> 00:10:09,319
Greenhouse which is where we have this

246
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,240
climate battery our plants are

247
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:14,079
consistently 3 4 feet taller than our

248
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:17,120
sativas and it should be the other way

249
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:18,759
around sativas are taller bigger plants

250
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,320
however we're creating a better

251
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:24,559
environment with this climate battery

252
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:26,079
cooler temperatures and heat at night

253
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:28,479
typically the heat at the bottom it's

254
00:10:26,078 --> 00:10:30,159
better for the roots in our other

255
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,800
Greenhouse we don't have that climate

256
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:34,719
battery our heat is over the plants so

257
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:37,000
we're not getting that heat underneath

258
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:39,879
so ultimately that's kind of killing us

259
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,600
in our sativa Greenhouse they still grow

260
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:45,559
they're still big plants but they they

261
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:47,399
they don't do what the conditions in our

262
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:49,759
state-of-the-art Greenhouse with this

263
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:49,759
climate

264
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:55,078
battery we test everything we have our

265
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:58,240
own equipment to be able to test you

266
00:10:55,078 --> 00:11:01,599
know levels of THC levels of CBD

267
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:03,680
pesticides things like that that we we

268
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:06,278
want to be sure I mean if we take it to

269
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:07,958
to some random lab and they're finding

270
00:11:06,278 --> 00:11:10,600
something that we're not then it it

271
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:10,599
raises some

272
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,240
questions
