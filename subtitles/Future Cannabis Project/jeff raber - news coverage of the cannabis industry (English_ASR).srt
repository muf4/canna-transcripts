1
00:00:06,108 --> 00:00:10,620
so certainly cannabis is a very

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,660
interesting and hot button topic it's

3
00:00:10,619 --> 00:00:14,459
very prevalent Lee talked about by many

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:17,039
people in many circles and in the news

5
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:18,990
it's exceptionally prevalent we've had

6
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,390
the benefit of being involved in news

7
00:00:18,989 --> 00:00:23,759
stories quite a bit and it's really

8
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,500
interesting from my perspective we have

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,118
people that aggregate the news and every

10
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,829
day I get a feed that says you know

11
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:31,018
here's the top headlines and things that

12
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:33,539
have worked and what's going around in

13
00:00:31,018 --> 00:00:35,070
and around the world mostly inside of

14
00:00:33,539 --> 00:00:36,869
the country predominantly in states that

15
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:39,210
are talking about things or have active

16
00:00:36,869 --> 00:00:40,679
programs already and when I see some of

17
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:43,049
these headlines I mean certainly they

18
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:44,429
grab your attention some of the times I

19
00:00:43,049 --> 00:00:46,259
read it and say there's just no way

20
00:00:44,429 --> 00:00:48,210
that's possibly write something seems to

21
00:00:46,259 --> 00:00:50,849
be misunderstood and from my own

22
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:52,948
personal experience being on the front

23
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,689
page of the LA Times or being involved

24
00:00:52,948 --> 00:00:57,210
in other articles that were written I

25
00:00:54,689 --> 00:00:59,459
can certainly attest to how a lot of

26
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:01,530
that is not exceptionally accurate so

27
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,960
unfortunately they don't quite often

28
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:06,329
understand what was being said I really

29
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,040
prefer reporters that have audio taped

30
00:01:06,329 --> 00:01:09,450
or recorded things so they're sure that

31
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,490
they can get all the words right and

32
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:14,640
understand the context of things were in

33
00:01:11,489 --> 00:01:15,810
that seems to have worked very much and

34
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,790
I don't know if that's an individual

35
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:19,710
thing but in my case that seems they've

36
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:21,180
led towards much more accurate reporting

37
00:01:19,709 --> 00:01:23,039
in a much better article in the end

38
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:24,450
maybe that person was just a little bit

39
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,700
more diligent than some of the other

40
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:28,770
experiences sometimes I feel that

41
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,359
they're often so rushed and these things

42
00:01:28,769 --> 00:01:32,188
are complex there's a lot of different

43
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:34,739
parts to understand in some of these

44
00:01:32,188 --> 00:01:36,719
stories they're not sure who to ask who

45
00:01:34,739 --> 00:01:38,699
are the experts and I can understand the

46
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:40,650
difficulties in that a lot of people

47
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,329
like to talk a lot or advertise a lot

48
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:44,460
since they're out there are they an

49
00:01:42,328 --> 00:01:46,019
expert maybe they just have a really big

50
00:01:44,459 --> 00:01:47,459
mouth and they just like to talk a lot

51
00:01:46,019 --> 00:01:50,090
but it doesn't mean what they're saying

52
00:01:47,459 --> 00:01:52,139
is actually accurate valid or true other

53
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:54,149
institutions have done really good jobs

54
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,590
about finding out experts sometimes

55
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:58,049
we're approached hey you guys have

56
00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:00,509
published on pesticide work how do I go

57
00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:02,040
about understanding us more can I come

58
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:03,899
back to you later if I have technical

59
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:05,909
questions and we always offer that type

60
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:07,290
of resource to the media and I think

61
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:09,689
that that's been very beneficial for

62
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:11,370
both them and for us we're sure accurate

63
00:02:09,689 --> 00:02:12,870
information is going out there and they

64
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,500
get a really good story that they feel

65
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:16,200
comfortable

66
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:18,210
confident about my one real pet peeve

67
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:20,519
with them is sometimes they try to make

68
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:22,290
a sensational headline and most people

69
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:24,240
don't read the rest of the article or

70
00:02:22,289 --> 00:02:26,849
really they just take that as the facts

71
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:28,740
so while it is meant to grab if you're

72
00:02:26,849 --> 00:02:30,780
not saying good things or accurate

73
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:32,280
things and even seen headlines that were

74
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:35,400
chromatic alee and correct and it makes

75
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:37,140
you wonder how that happens it's not

76
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,189
going to be to the betterment of

77
00:02:37,139 --> 00:02:39,839
everyone else it's going to be

78
00:02:38,189 --> 00:02:42,150
detrimental so if you say things like

79
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,280
all strains are the same that wasn't

80
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:46,340
what we were saying our comment was all

81
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:49,140
these strains are very very different

82
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:51,360
yet sometimes the naming is Miss named

83
00:02:49,139 --> 00:02:52,979
sometimes they're you know abused in

84
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,050
types of what names are tagged to which

85
00:02:52,979 --> 00:02:56,969
products and patients have a hard time

86
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:58,830
finding what products are actually

87
00:02:56,969 --> 00:03:01,289
looking for that's why we were profiling

88
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:03,180
all of the plant and looking at over 30

89
00:03:01,289 --> 00:03:05,009
different compounds to do that the

90
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:06,719
headline of the article said all pots

91
00:03:05,009 --> 00:03:08,250
the same must all be stuff they just

92
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:10,680
call it funny names and I don't see the

93
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:12,300
difference that has caused me probably

94
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,770
two years worth of answering questions

95
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,209
and other work till we're finally at the

96
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:17,850
point now where we've gotten some other

97
00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:19,259
articles out there and and published on

98
00:03:17,849 --> 00:03:21,449
you know peer-reviewed journal articles

99
00:03:19,259 --> 00:03:23,129
about here is exactly what we were

100
00:03:21,449 --> 00:03:24,899
saying and why we see these differences

101
00:03:23,129 --> 00:03:27,719
and how we need to move forward in a

102
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:29,670
chemo typing sense that article / you

103
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:31,379
know it was personally relevant to me

104
00:03:29,669 --> 00:03:33,000
because I gave the interview and to see

105
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:35,370
it misconstrued and conveyed in the

106
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,080
improper fashion for a sensational

107
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:39,390
headline was exceptionally frustrating

108
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:41,070
we feel ourselves we have an utmost

109
00:03:39,389 --> 00:03:42,809
responsibility to be accurate and

110
00:03:41,069 --> 00:03:44,819
everything we say to be professional at

111
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:46,409
all times I think the media has to look

112
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:48,269
at things that way to they have to take

113
00:03:46,409 --> 00:03:50,219
that as an exceptionally important role

114
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:51,750
they can't just say whatever they want

115
00:03:50,219 --> 00:03:54,090
to say they can't say things for

116
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:55,979
sensationalism or headlines they have to

117
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:57,930
be accurate first and foremost and if it

118
00:03:55,979 --> 00:03:59,939
makes it a little bit more dry or boring

119
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:01,439
at least it's the facts and everybody

120
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:03,539
can count on that as being you know an

121
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:06,329
accurate representation if you start to

122
00:04:03,539 --> 00:04:07,828
see it's like trust one set one type of

123
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:09,390
thing takes that away all of a sudden

124
00:04:07,829 --> 00:04:11,879
you start to distrust all of it and

125
00:04:09,389 --> 00:04:13,619
you're just not sure well as the next

126
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:15,329
story accurate I know my story really

127
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:17,129
well when they talk to me about the

128
00:04:15,329 --> 00:04:18,689
nuclear power plant problems that were

129
00:04:17,129 --> 00:04:21,089
there do they know that story really

130
00:04:18,689 --> 00:04:22,889
well I don't even know if I'm confident

131
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:24,359
if the story I did know wasn't accurate

132
00:04:22,889 --> 00:04:26,668
how can I be confident

133
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,740
rest of those things are accurate so I

134
00:04:26,668 --> 00:04:30,180
understand it's a difficult job there's

135
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:31,978
a lot of complexities when I've been

136
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:33,329
interviewed you know they don't know

137
00:04:31,978 --> 00:04:35,158
science they're not really sure exactly

138
00:04:33,329 --> 00:04:37,310
which questions to ask they've been

139
00:04:35,158 --> 00:04:39,300
tasked with go talk about cannabis

140
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:41,819
because it should be something in the

141
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:43,468
press they weren't really sure sometimes

142
00:04:41,819 --> 00:04:45,210
it takes a long period of time

143
00:04:43,468 --> 00:04:47,668
especially with something as complex as

144
00:04:45,209 --> 00:04:49,649
cannabis to really filter through all of

145
00:04:47,668 --> 00:04:51,930
the details and get a good factual

146
00:04:49,649 --> 00:04:53,370
accurate representation the ones that

147
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:54,810
are just trying to rush to get the story

148
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:56,490
probably scare me the most in this

149
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:58,288
context because unless they've been

150
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:59,819
following this for years and they're

151
00:04:58,288 --> 00:05:02,068
going to report on something very new

152
00:04:59,819 --> 00:05:03,569
and had all the background someone that

153
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:05,879
just shows up today to say I want to

154
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:08,129
talk about reporting on cannabis they

155
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:09,750
have a lot to learn and it really might

156
00:05:08,129 --> 00:05:11,278
be a very difficult story for them to

157
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:13,110
write quickly some have done a good job

158
00:05:11,278 --> 00:05:14,728
if they stay in a very narrow focused

159
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:16,710
part and talk to a few experts in the

160
00:05:14,728 --> 00:05:19,139
area but I've seen a lot of misleading

161
00:05:16,709 --> 00:05:21,180
information and then if they summarize

162
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:22,860
and they're trying to distill down and

163
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:24,449
make it more simple you can lose key

164
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:26,278
details if they didn't understand what

165
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:27,680
were the key points so over

166
00:05:26,278 --> 00:05:29,819
generalization of some things

167
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,038
sensationalized headlines those are

168
00:05:29,819 --> 00:05:33,689
leading towards negative connotations

169
00:05:32,038 --> 00:05:35,338
and pushing us backwards instead of

170
00:05:33,689 --> 00:05:37,800
saying here's the accurate actual

171
00:05:35,338 --> 00:05:39,088
factual information this is how we can

172
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,310
move forward best from here and

173
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:43,588
sometimes that is negative information

174
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:45,870
to hey these reports have said this just

175
00:05:43,588 --> 00:05:47,250
happened cite your sources you know make

176
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:49,259
sure they're valid and understand where

177
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:51,088
it's all coming from it's just the fact

178
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:53,098
that being a good reporter is a lot like

179
00:05:51,088 --> 00:05:55,228
a good scientific mind set why did I

180
00:05:53,098 --> 00:05:57,000
find what I found how do I validate and

181
00:05:55,228 --> 00:05:58,918
verify that that's actually the case and

182
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,509
how do I go about representing this in

183
00:05:58,918 --> 00:06:02,609
the accurate fashion in an unbiased

184
00:06:00,509 --> 00:06:04,110
manner so that I'm not trying to

185
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:05,580
personally influence or skew these

186
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:07,408
things I'm actually representing the

187
00:06:05,579 --> 00:06:09,418
facts that were presented they would do

188
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:11,519
a lot more of that I think that would be

189
00:06:09,418 --> 00:06:13,348
a lot better cannabis is always a

190
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:15,688
hot-button for everybody it seems to

191
00:06:13,348 --> 00:06:17,218
polarize you know many people in many

192
00:06:15,689 --> 00:06:18,960
discussions you can certainly find

193
00:06:17,218 --> 00:06:20,639
people on either end of the spectrum of

194
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:22,560
I think everybody should have it for

195
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,180
every single thing to absolutely no one

196
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,740
should have it the real answer is

197
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:27,509
probably somewhere in between for all of

198
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:29,189
that and we have a broad section of

199
00:06:27,509 --> 00:06:31,050
society that should benefit from

200
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:32,610
accurate information representation in

201
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:35,538
that and then make their own best

202
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:35,538
informed decisions
