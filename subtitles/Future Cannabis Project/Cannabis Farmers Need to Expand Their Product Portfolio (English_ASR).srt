[Music]

2
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:16,260
for a lot of people they've only sold

3
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:18,480
flour so for most people the only thing

4
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:21,630
that they know how to sell is flour I

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:24,109
grow flour I sell flower but in the new

6
00:00:21,629 --> 00:00:26,669
white market where they're gonna enter

7
00:00:24,109 --> 00:00:29,640
well who's gonna buy a thousand pounds

8
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:31,410
of your flour it's especially when it's

9
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,020
sold by the 8th of the quarter maybe in

10
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:36,600
a dispensary so you know you're talking

11
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:39,450
10,000 20,000 30,000 people a lot people

12
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:41,219
on it by pocket and so what you have to

13
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:43,050
understand is that the markets have

14
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:45,090
stratified in cannabis they've changed

15
00:00:43,049 --> 00:00:48,119
and so California cannabis is basically

16
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:51,899
half oil production half flower

17
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:53,578
production five years ago 100% flower so

18
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:55,590
in five years you know you're talking

19
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:59,009
half the market is now oil and oil means

20
00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:00,809
all forms of concentrate but if you look

21
00:00:59,009 --> 00:01:02,759
at the all forms of concentrate you're

22
00:01:00,808 --> 00:01:06,868
gonna find that basically one thirtieth

23
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:09,868
of it is rosin shatter fresh freeze and

24
00:01:06,868 --> 00:01:12,450
the other twenty nine out of that thirty

25
00:01:09,868 --> 00:01:14,010
slices is all distillate which which is

26
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:15,150
basically stuff used for food production

27
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:17,219
food grade

28
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:19,740
for edibles and predominantly for

29
00:01:17,219 --> 00:01:23,370
petting and so the pen market is

30
00:01:19,739 --> 00:01:24,390
probably 46% 47% of the total sales in

31
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:26,930
California

32
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:30,540
so people are obsessed with pen sales

33
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:32,760
and it's the new change in how we smoke

34
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:35,280
people don't roll pot anymore I don't

35
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:37,320
I'm old school it's what I know but for

36
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,469
everyone else's ecig in and the likes

37
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:44,369
devices the pen is really this new mode

38
00:01:40,469 --> 00:01:46,319
of usage and because of it it's it's a

39
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:48,510
very interesting thing because it used

40
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:51,119
to scare people who sold flour because

41
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:52,500
the trim people that I call them that

42
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:54,750
depend people basically have a trim

43
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,189
people they would just want trim and

44
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:58,650
turn it into pen they never want to pay

45
00:01:56,189 --> 00:02:00,929
any high dollar for the flower because

46
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:02,730
they add plant-derived terpene so they

47
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:05,190
don't need quality terms they can take

48
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:07,380
anything and make it into something but

49
00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:11,129
as we go forward with the shortage of

50
00:02:07,379 --> 00:02:13,019
clean cannabis and testing testing makes

51
00:02:11,129 --> 00:02:15,210
the distillate market the toughest

52
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:17,580
market to get in because it's a

53
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:20,640
concentrate market so therefore if

54
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:23,760
there's 88 percent of the flower that's

55
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:25,859
really needed for cannabis and legally

56
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:28,229
is dirty that means there's only 12

57
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:30,660
percent that means there's only six

58
00:02:28,229 --> 00:02:32,129
percent to cover all distillate because

59
00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:33,930
six percent of that flower is gonna

60
00:02:32,129 --> 00:02:35,069
cover the flower and six percent of its

61
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:37,319
going to go to distil looks that's the

62
00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:38,879
breakdown in California so if there's

63
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:42,469
only 12 pounds six are going to

64
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:44,479
distillate six are going over to flower

65
00:02:42,469 --> 00:02:47,419
that

66
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:49,669
is a massive amount of product needed in

67
00:02:47,419 --> 00:02:50,750
a highly regulated tested market I think

68
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:53,509
that that's one of the things that the

69
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:55,639
farmers who are clean or organic who

70
00:02:53,509 --> 00:02:57,348
didn't get into the business to make the

71
00:02:55,639 --> 00:03:00,018
money as much as they are actually been

72
00:02:57,348 --> 00:03:02,359
doing it for time as a lifestyle their

73
00:03:00,019 --> 00:03:04,519
margin should be a lot less in the

74
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:06,530
margin meaning the cost of production if

75
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:09,289
you don't have an incredibly expensive

76
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:10,669
lease on your farm and you're in Humble

77
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:11,989
where the cost of production is

78
00:03:10,669 --> 00:03:14,389
relatively I think it's the lowest in

79
00:03:11,989 --> 00:03:17,689
the state you have an opportunity to

80
00:03:14,389 --> 00:03:20,149
grow intelligent choices farm them

81
00:03:17,689 --> 00:03:22,159
correctly and turn them into products

82
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:25,069
that then sell in a market that has an

83
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:27,318
incredible velocity velocity is speed of

84
00:03:25,068 --> 00:03:29,089
product through the system so if I made

85
00:03:27,318 --> 00:03:30,378
a hundred thousand dollars over a year

86
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:32,689
that's awesome but if I made a hundred

87
00:03:30,378 --> 00:03:34,818
thousand dollars in a week it's better

88
00:03:32,689 --> 00:03:36,919
because that hundred thousand in a week

89
00:03:34,818 --> 00:03:39,530
now capitalizes me and lets me use that

90
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:40,659
money as a tool versus as a paycheck and

91
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:43,120
there

92
00:03:40,659 --> 00:03:44,650
and as we go forward its velocity of

93
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,689
return that really determines the

94
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:47,860
farmers quiddity the amount of money you

95
00:03:46,689 --> 00:03:49,210
have to use that

96
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:51,490
that's your capitalization amount of

97
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:54,550
money you have that invest all of these

98
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:57,070
things you need to survive and your

99
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:58,390
choices dictate it so I grew a thousand

100
00:03:57,069 --> 00:03:58,989
pounds and I didn't sell them till next

101
00:03:58,389 --> 00:04:02,019
year

102
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:04,120
whew that's a tough one you might not

103
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:05,560
even survive through the winter because

104
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:08,980
you got trim costs and all this other

105
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:10,689
who's paying it and so for a lot of us I

106
00:04:08,979 --> 00:04:12,759
think that when you look at cannabis

107
00:04:10,689 --> 00:04:15,370
you'll look at it more stratified

108
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:18,039
meaning pieces of your flower go piece

109
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:19,329
of your total go as flower and you'll

110
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:21,310
find the markets that want those

111
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:23,529
specific things and everything else is

112
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:26,439
going to go into these other forms until

113
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:28,139
the the large entities come in and

114
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:30,129
vertically take over the business

115
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:32,469
imagine if we were all small crop

116
00:04:30,129 --> 00:04:34,689
farmers for Philip Morris and we were

117
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:36,010
all producing tobacco for them because

118
00:04:34,689 --> 00:04:37,959
right now it's impossible for them to

119
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:39,579
get the total quantity but once they

120
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:42,189
have the ability to get into the system

121
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:44,709
five years and totally no regulations in

122
00:04:42,189 --> 00:04:47,500
terms of scope and probably a lot less

123
00:04:44,709 --> 00:04:48,879
restrictive legal system then all of a

124
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,560
sudden that would change because they

125
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:53,170
would vertically fill their supply

126
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,949
chains but until these supply chains are

127
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:55,870
filled

128
00:04:53,949 --> 00:04:57,279
you have a window of time and I think

129
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:59,290
that for a predominant number of the

130
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:00,639
smaller farmers that's how they have to

131
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:02,920
see it is that they have to recapitalize

132
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:05,800
and pay the cost to get the farm squared

133
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:07,870
away to get their lives in order so that

134
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,310
when the next transition comes they're

135
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:13,180
not left like they are right now which

136
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:16,269
is basically underprepared can you talk

137
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:19,569
more about a distillate and

138
00:05:16,269 --> 00:05:23,500
what the challenges are to making the

139
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:25,569
desolate murmurs distillate is the

140
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:28,120
product that's been cleaned up from

141
00:05:25,569 --> 00:05:30,279
crude so crude is basically the throw in

142
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:32,230
cannabis that's clean meaning no

143
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:35,139
chemicals in it did not chemically grown

144
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:36,160
if you're using a two-part fertilizer

145
00:05:35,139 --> 00:05:37,659
that's not what I mean

146
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,310
what I mean is you're using illegal

147
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:40,930
products that are going to taint the

148
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:44,439
cannabis that you've applied yourself

149
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:46,720
chemically so bunch of sides pesticides

150
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:48,790
growth regulators if it doesn't have any

151
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,740
of that stuff then this is perfect

152
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:53,410
because any of these products can go

153
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:56,680
into basically hexane extraction where

154
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:58,870
they take the material that you have and

155
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:01,449
they use hexane to strip it all out and

156
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:03,040
that has all your lipids your waxes and

157
00:06:01,449 --> 00:06:06,579
the chlorophyll in all the cannabinoids

158
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:07,780
no terms and then they take that product

159
00:06:06,579 --> 00:06:10,209
and they run that through a distillation

160
00:06:07,779 --> 00:06:11,409
system closed paths and something some

161
00:06:10,209 --> 00:06:12,888
short path some kind of something's

162
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:15,530
going to peel it off

163
00:06:12,889 --> 00:06:17,240
and that gets rid of all the heavy waste

164
00:06:15,529 --> 00:06:18,589
the lipids in the chlorophylls and all

165
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:20,418
the other components and it's left with

166
00:06:18,589 --> 00:06:23,478
now something that can be combined with

167
00:06:20,418 --> 00:06:25,250
the vehicle or a solvent and nowadays we

168
00:06:23,478 --> 00:06:27,168
use in terms of solvents but before they

169
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:28,939
used all polypropylene glycol which is a

170
00:06:27,168 --> 00:06:31,158
carcinogen so now you may know not to

171
00:06:28,939 --> 00:06:33,650
use it but most pens will poly propylene

172
00:06:31,158 --> 00:06:34,908
glycol pens prior and so now they're

173
00:06:33,649 --> 00:06:38,718
trying to figure out how do we use

174
00:06:34,908 --> 00:06:40,370
terpene mixes to keep the distillate

175
00:06:38,718 --> 00:06:42,348
liquefied enough to function

176
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:44,750
independently so the challenge is

177
00:06:42,348 --> 00:06:47,930
creating these formulations that make

178
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:51,228
them work but the bottom line is the pen

179
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:54,860
market is so big and regulated cannabis

180
00:06:51,228 --> 00:06:57,168
requires clean product then for many

181
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:58,669
farmers you'll find yourself growing

182
00:06:57,168 --> 00:07:01,188
product and then what do you do with it

183
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:03,198
you'll be able to have people come to

184
00:07:01,189 --> 00:07:05,000
your property and extract it through

185
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:07,610
hexane labs that are permitted on

186
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,168
trailers so this year I had fresh frozen

187
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:11,509
done at my property where I had a group

188
00:07:09,168 --> 00:07:14,389
of individuals come out and harvest all

189
00:07:11,509 --> 00:07:16,370
my canvas and go into freezers and then

190
00:07:14,389 --> 00:07:18,710
blow it and then return it to me so I

191
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:20,750
could sell it to my store this is

192
00:07:18,709 --> 00:07:22,579
different this is basically where that's

193
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:25,718
just being blown right on the spot and

194
00:07:22,579 --> 00:07:29,300
it's coming out looking like kilo sized

195
00:07:25,718 --> 00:07:30,889
black abalone so the machine can spit

196
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:32,478
out any size but typically it looks like

197
00:07:30,889 --> 00:07:34,240
you pushing out about a key at a time in

198
00:07:32,478 --> 00:07:36,279
its load form

199
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,379
and then those keys get vacuum wrapped

200
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:40,119
up with all the invoice and they get

201
00:07:38,379 --> 00:07:42,038
shipped out to the to the to the

202
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:45,970
individuals distributors need this

203
00:07:42,038 --> 00:07:48,250
product all edible and pen industries

204
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:49,509
rely on crude that's just like saying

205
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:52,478
you don't care about crude but you're

206
00:07:49,509 --> 00:07:53,530
buying gas if they don't have crude

207
00:07:52,478 --> 00:07:55,930
coming out of the ground there is no

208
00:07:53,529 --> 00:07:58,359
gasoline at the gas stove so crude is

209
00:07:55,930 --> 00:08:02,350
the basis of all of us and it's one of

210
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:04,120
the simpler methods to utilize for

211
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:06,100
farmers because it allows them to put

212
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:09,430
themselves into a position where there's

213
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:10,930
bulk sales shatters concentrates they're

214
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:13,269
not bulk sales you have to be able to

215
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:15,490
move into stores in most of the stores

216
00:08:13,269 --> 00:08:17,769
most of the larger places that used to

217
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:20,019
do a lot of this work became vertical so

218
00:08:17,769 --> 00:08:22,029
they started to purchase there in their

219
00:08:20,019 --> 00:08:25,629
own farms so they could grow their own

220
00:08:22,029 --> 00:08:27,189
cannabis they own their own distillation

221
00:08:25,629 --> 00:08:29,439
facilities so they can make their own

222
00:08:27,189 --> 00:08:32,649
products now they can sell it as pen and

223
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:36,038
they can control the whole path and for

224
00:08:32,649 --> 00:08:37,599
a lot of people that was how they made

225
00:08:36,038 --> 00:08:39,278
their money with shatter and super

226
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,110
concentrates was they put it into places

227
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:43,958
they couldn't those places in a vertical

228
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:45,879
also and so what you need is some place

229
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:48,639
that's gonna take it in a level that's

230
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:50,230
bigger than you can produce you want

231
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:53,230
there to be a mouth too big for you to

232
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:55,959
feed yourself and most people can blow

233
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:57,940
their whole farm of of crude and it

234
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:59,708
would leave but I challenge you to blow

235
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:01,860
up a whole farm a super concentrate and

236
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:04,259
sell it in one shot

237
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:06,629
because it's gonna have to get sold and

238
00:09:04,259 --> 00:09:08,819
bled into little pieces through whereas

239
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:11,759
the pen market is insatiable they need

240
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:14,520
the raw material different than I need a

241
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:18,419
finished product to sell it store one of

242
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:20,279
them is you selling coal and and the

243
00:09:18,419 --> 00:09:22,949
steel mills need the coal they can't

244
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:25,079
make the steel without the coal and you

245
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:26,970
were the one making the coal and if you

246
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,560
can understand that and it's easy people

247
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:30,990
just don't understand this because we're

248
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:33,239
pot growers and pot sellers know you're

249
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:35,850
in the cannabis industry you wherever

250
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,230
you were you were but you are no longer

251
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:38,909
that if you want to stay in business

252
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:40,110
business is going to tell you what

253
00:09:38,909 --> 00:09:41,610
you're going to become and if you get

254
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:43,740
too emotional about it then you get to

255
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:45,360
go bankrupt and so if you make the

256
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:47,789
decisions it means you're flexible and

257
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,430
you move to where the markets expand if

258
00:09:47,789 --> 00:09:52,319
people still wanted to smoke a sativa

259
00:09:50,429 --> 00:09:56,839
from the 70s it would still be selling

260
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,840
but it's not so growers had to change

261
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:01,389
that's huge people do not understand

262
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:02,250
what I'm saying when I talk about this

263
00:10:01,389 --> 00:10:13,500
shit

264
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:13,500
