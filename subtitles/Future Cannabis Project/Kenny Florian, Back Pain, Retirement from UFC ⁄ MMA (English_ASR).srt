1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,250
I find a lot of benefits to just the

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:06,990
oils and the creams for for pain joint

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:09,960
pain and stuff like that it's been huge

4
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:13,109
I actually retired in 2011 because of

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,610
back pain and one of the things that

6
00:00:13,109 --> 00:00:18,239
really helped me was was smoking

7
00:00:14,609 --> 00:00:20,070
cannabis there was so much pain that it

8
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:21,919
hurt if I sat down or her if I stood up

9
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:27,480
and heard if I moved it didn't matter

10
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:31,070
and it was extremely helpful and allowed

11
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:33,659
me to function on a daily basis and

12
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:36,960
little by little able to kind of work my

13
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:38,578
way back into training but yeah and I'm

14
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,399
the kind of person that if I'm not doing

15
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:43,649
martial arts I'm miserable I get

16
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:46,070
depressed so I need that as an outlet

17
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:51,469
for for me physically and creatively and

18
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:51,469
if cannabis is has allowed me to do that
