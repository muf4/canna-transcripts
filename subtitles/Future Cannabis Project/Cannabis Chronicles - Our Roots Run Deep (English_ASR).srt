00:07:38,038 --> 00:07:42,180
start my interviews on the cannabis hour

169
00:07:40,019 --> 00:07:43,680
and that is by going to each of my

170
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:46,288
panelists and asking what is your

171
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:51,990
personal relationship with cannabis so

172
00:07:46,288 --> 00:07:58,218
pebbles would you like to start hmm Mary

173
00:07:51,990 --> 00:08:07,430
Jane a mile for him I see marijuana as a

174
00:07:58,218 --> 00:08:14,060
friend basically as a close collaborator

175
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:19,139
and companion that understands me and

176
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:22,800
treats me very well when I'm down the

177
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:26,389
herb whips me huh when I'm to agitate it

178
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:31,079
calms me down when I'm a consumable

179
00:08:26,389 --> 00:08:35,070
since almost me and I love all parts of

180
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:37,259
that look of the plant but the leaf

181
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:39,419
that's when I was mine made me busted

182
00:08:37,259 --> 00:08:42,840
with was the leaf so I believe in that

183
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:50,519
too and root team

184
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:53,340
is the new thing so I believe in mother

185
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:55,649
nature I revere mother nature and

186
00:08:53,340 --> 00:09:01,680
cannabis is at the center of my life and

187
00:08:55,649 --> 00:09:05,370
has basically shown me the most

188
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:08,819
wonderful way of life beautiful pebbles

189
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:13,470
Thank You Cecile what's your personal

190
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:17,430
relationship with cannabis in 1974 when

191
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:21,290
I started to be a grower and pack water

192
00:09:17,429 --> 00:09:21,289
into the woods on my back

193
00:09:21,539 --> 00:09:29,519
I was also practicing yoga hatha yoga

194
00:09:27,089 --> 00:09:35,790
and it helped me with my practice and

195
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:39,990
during the course of growing I read High

196
00:09:35,789 --> 00:09:47,610
Times magazine and there was an article

197
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:50,399
on the goddess zy z IH u a she is the

198
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:53,519
goddess of marijuana purple marijuana

199
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:58,740
and lo and behold in my garden when I

200
00:09:53,519 --> 00:10:05,399
was growing one year there she was all

201
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:09,419
purple and so she became my spiritual

202
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:13,649
guide and it's not something you can see

203
00:10:09,419 --> 00:10:16,979
and no but I felt that she kept guiding

204
00:10:13,649 --> 00:10:22,110
me so that I learned to make herbal

205
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:24,740
products and continue to grow many years

206
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:30,149
and had many associates in Point Arena

207
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:34,320
who grew along with me we had a natural

208
00:10:30,149 --> 00:10:37,649
food store and many of us grew plants to

209
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:42,150
finance the store and the building and

210
00:10:37,649 --> 00:10:46,620
we had a motto and it was food for

211
00:10:42,149 --> 00:10:49,169
people not for profit and we would be

212
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:52,409
we'd have meetings month once a month

213
00:10:49,169 --> 00:10:54,719
and we bring our herb and we trimmed it

214
00:10:52,409 --> 00:11:00,149
at our meetings

215
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:05,040
and it was a very very open time and I

216
00:11:00,149 --> 00:11:07,799
learned how to be involved in a

217
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:10,709
collective so I felt that this was all

218
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:14,429
the guidance of the spiritual side of

219
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:17,730
the plant which is a science now that

220
00:11:14,429 --> 00:11:22,019
many people call planet spirit medicine

221
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:28,620
and every plant has a spirit or maybe

222
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:31,289
more as people have spirit and the the

223
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:35,399
spirit of marijuana has supported me and

224
00:11:31,289 --> 00:11:37,469
loved me and guided me and helped me

225
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:42,360
develop as a human being

226
00:11:37,470 --> 00:12:06,180
hmm so that's my relationship with the

227
00:11:42,360 --> 00:12:17,420
herb I love her for me my awakening to

228
00:12:06,179 --> 00:12:21,479
this magical plant began in 1968 and the

229
00:12:17,419 --> 00:12:24,240
rock concerts were just coming onto the

230
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:28,139
scene and large venues they've outgrown

231
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:35,759
small clubs and and I was fortunate

232
00:12:28,139 --> 00:12:38,879
enough to to go and see band called

233
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:41,580
Vanilla Fudge and they were the warm-up

234
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:47,490
act for for Jimi Hendrix and the

235
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:50,759
experience and at the time I was a a non

236
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:52,769
cannabis smoker I was a 3-2 beer drinker

237
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:59,700
because that's what it was in Colorado

238
00:12:52,769 --> 00:13:02,960
and then a few months later I had my

239
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:02,960
first experience with

240
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:12,480
and we part took a bit before going to

241
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:15,450
my next concert and life has not been

242
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,800
the same since I got to say and I don't

243
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:19,770
know if it was a band or if it was the

244
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:21,240
plant but it was the little-known band

245
00:13:19,769 --> 00:13:24,689
that had never performed before in the

246
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:26,850
United States and they were flown in at

247
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:30,120
the last minute and as the story goes

248
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:33,029
they would bid $1500 in the band it was

249
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:37,049
the last time they were an opening act

250
00:13:33,029 --> 00:13:39,269
it was Led Zeppelin and we didn't know

251
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:41,279
what happened we weren't sure if it was

252
00:13:39,269 --> 00:13:42,240
the the magic of the plant the word that

253
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:46,019
was the band I think it was a

254
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:52,399
combination of the two but this began my

255
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:57,029
journey and I started realizing after

256
00:13:52,399 --> 00:14:00,299
experimentation and it was a really big

257
00:13:57,029 --> 00:14:04,860
deal I mean it was like so hidden to to

258
00:14:00,299 --> 00:14:09,629
be smoking cannabis but once I realized

259
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:13,919
then that there was something really

260
00:14:09,629 --> 00:14:17,490
wrong here why is it so illegal why were

261
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:20,969
we lied to about this and so for me it

262
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:24,960
it pulled back the veil of illusion that

263
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:29,850
I had been force-fed that this was a bad

264
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:31,769
evil plan and and I realized well if

265
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:34,019
we're being lied to about this what else

266
00:14:31,769 --> 00:14:37,529
are we being lied to so it kind of

267
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:40,409
became a truth serum for me and still is

268
00:14:37,529 --> 00:14:41,970
to this day it allows me to to see

269
00:14:40,409 --> 00:14:45,959
things a little differently to put a

270
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:50,970
different spin on it and just so

271
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:52,650
grateful to to have been exposed to the

272
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:54,800
wonders of this magical plant and I do

273
00:14:52,649 --> 00:14:58,590
believe that the future of this plan

274
00:14:54,799 --> 00:15:03,240
because it is a female plant I believe

275
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:04,800
the future is for this I don't like the

276
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:07,710
word industry I think it's good I think

277
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:10,909
it's a feminine future that we're

278
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:10,910
heading into I hope it is

279
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:18,329
and I love hearing what you all have to

280
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:19,980
say about your experiences what cannabis

281
00:15:18,328 --> 00:15:22,078
it sounds like it's very spiritual for

282
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:24,240
everyone up here so I'm glad we all

283
00:15:22,078 --> 00:15:26,099
relate on that and I feel that way with

284
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,860
my own personal relationship with Hannah

285
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:31,980
missed you so I wanted to ask all three

286
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:33,629
of you when you change Mendocino County

287
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:35,278
did you come as part of the

288
00:15:33,629 --> 00:15:37,379
back-to-the-land movement or was that

289
00:15:35,278 --> 00:15:39,929
anything that was present in any of your

290
00:15:37,379 --> 00:15:44,659
lives here and we can just bounce around

291
00:15:39,929 --> 00:15:44,659
you know the first person who thinks oh

292
00:15:47,778 --> 00:15:57,059
I was part of a collective we were

293
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:58,439
renting and living in a warehouse a

294
00:15:57,059 --> 00:16:02,879
twenty five thousand square foot

295
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:04,199
warehouse in Berkeley and wonderful

296
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:06,689
things were happening there we were

297
00:16:04,198 --> 00:16:08,639
manufacturing electrical generating

298
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:15,240
windmills back then nobody was

299
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:19,470
generating alternative energy and the

300
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:21,750
Landlord decided to double our rent and

301
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:24,720
we were planning on moving up to

302
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:27,448
Mendocino at the end of our five-year

303
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:30,690
lease but this has happened about three

304
00:16:27,448 --> 00:16:34,889
years into it so we radically

305
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:36,930
accelerated our moving date and didn't

306
00:16:34,889 --> 00:16:39,448
quite have the infrastructure that we

307
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:41,939
were hoping to have but we it was a

308
00:16:39,448 --> 00:16:44,789
crash landing but we walked away from it

309
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:46,529
but the back to the land movement very

310
00:16:44,789 --> 00:16:53,750
much spoke to me in fact that's a large

311
00:16:46,528 --> 00:16:58,139
part of my collection it was the

312
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:59,519
dissolution of the Summer of Love and

313
00:16:58,139 --> 00:17:03,120
everything that was happening in the Bay

314
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:06,509
Area which was the cultural hub for the

315
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:10,199
youth movement and many people and

316
00:17:06,509 --> 00:17:13,398
thanks to the Rolling Stone magazine and

317
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:15,089
High Times and mother of news and so on

318
00:17:13,398 --> 00:17:17,638
go to the country

319
00:17:15,088 --> 00:17:22,740
buy some inexpensive land and build a

320
00:17:17,638 --> 00:17:25,918
house in rural garden and and we came by

321
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:28,950
the thousands and many of us are still

322
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:31,860
here wonderful things have happened as a

323
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:36,058
result of it so that was very much part

324
00:17:31,859 --> 00:17:38,638
of the back to land movement I came to

325
00:17:36,058 --> 00:17:41,190
San Francisco because my hippie daughter

326
00:17:38,638 --> 00:17:49,558
ran away from home and that's living on

327
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:53,788
Haight Street and so I came to and so

328
00:17:49,558 --> 00:17:57,408
and I also had experienced the wonderful

329
00:17:53,788 --> 00:18:03,089
green herb in New York so I was already

330
00:17:57,409 --> 00:18:07,100
a pothead or I would like to say that it

331
00:18:03,089 --> 00:18:11,339
was the second psychedelic part the the

332
00:18:07,099 --> 00:18:15,449
the not the entertainment part but the

333
00:18:11,339 --> 00:18:19,308
the transforming part that attracted me

334
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:27,120
very much because one of my experiences

335
00:18:19,308 --> 00:18:32,009
when I had a marijuana pipe full of very

336
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:34,829
good weed was I hallucinatin a temple in

337
00:18:32,009 --> 00:18:35,250
India and I had never even heard of such

338
00:18:34,829 --> 00:18:41,629
a thing

339
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:47,009
and so I I felt the expansion of the

340
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:51,570
herb and so being in in San Francisco it

341
00:18:47,009 --> 00:18:54,869
was very natural for me to to want to

342
00:18:51,569 --> 00:18:59,099
expand and then when I came here back

343
00:18:54,869 --> 00:19:03,028
from India I went I took a ride

344
00:18:59,099 --> 00:19:06,269
I bought a postal van and I lived I went

345
00:19:03,028 --> 00:19:08,940
to the dunes to meditate with my herb

346
00:19:06,269 --> 00:19:12,960
and I realized that I had to live here

347
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:14,059
that I was attracted to the ocean and

348
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,490
the

349
00:19:14,059 --> 00:19:20,089
possibility of growing grass in my

350
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:29,470
backyard and so I guess that is why I

351
00:19:20,089 --> 00:19:33,109
came I I tried to move here in the 70s

352
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:38,690
when I was a landless back to the lender

353
00:19:33,109 --> 00:19:42,199
and that was not feasible so I

354
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:46,660
immediately stored it as the place to

355
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:52,400
return to which I did 20 years later in

356
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:56,360
1994 and two partners of mine agreed to

357
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:59,060
sign on as tenants in common I really

358
00:19:56,359 --> 00:20:02,539
recommend this because each person owns

359
00:19:59,059 --> 00:20:06,399
an equal part or the demand for three

360
00:20:02,539 --> 00:20:08,899
markets they cannot confiscate your land

361
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:11,000
without the other people agreement

362
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:13,700
presumably you have the trust of those

363
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:16,369
people so you can feel very secure in

364
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:17,750
this period of those pendants they take

365
00:20:16,369 --> 00:20:21,349
it away you know you had too many

366
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:25,460
violations civilly and so on and so I

367
00:20:21,349 --> 00:20:27,289
was able to secure a place in the 90s

368
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:30,049
but in the 70s

369
00:20:27,289 --> 00:20:33,470
I am indicee know just couldn't

370
00:20:30,049 --> 00:20:37,069
accommodate someone as grassroots it has

371
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:41,839
myself and so I went to San Francisco

372
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:44,720
and got in with Dennis Peron and Bernie

373
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:48,919
Mary in that crowd and introduced myself

374
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:51,319
or linked to cannabis that way with the

375
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:54,039
people who were organizing labor were

376
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:58,129
responsible for organizing prop 215

377
00:20:54,039 --> 00:21:01,430
which is kind of where I came in because

378
00:20:58,130 --> 00:21:08,350
all of those years I was getting busted

379
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:11,480
for the default decade it was because of

380
00:21:08,349 --> 00:21:16,579
what I was introduced to through them

381
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:21,289
and my commitment of course is above all

382
00:21:16,579 --> 00:21:26,299
to the plant but after that my

383
00:21:21,289 --> 00:21:27,049
commitment is to adjust society and that

384
00:21:26,299 --> 00:21:30,859
means

385
00:21:27,049 --> 00:21:33,819
to the cannabis community and the

386
00:21:30,859 --> 00:21:37,939
initiative didn't cover the

387
00:21:33,819 --> 00:21:40,659
transportation and in fact it didn't

388
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:44,299
cover cultivation in the very beginning

389
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:45,340
they just had possession obtain some

390
00:21:44,299 --> 00:21:48,409
possession

391
00:21:45,339 --> 00:21:51,049
well that isn't enough that brings up

392
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:53,480
the miracle pounds and where is that

393
00:21:51,049 --> 00:21:56,419
coming from well the Bowery Corral in

394
00:21:53,480 --> 00:22:00,920
Santa Cruz she is here amongst us in

395
00:21:56,420 --> 00:22:04,130
spirit said include cultivation or I

396
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:06,590
won't support it and they said okay

397
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:09,380
Mallory you got it and so they included

398
00:22:06,589 --> 00:22:12,169
the cultivation but I didn't have such

399
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:14,570
access on transportation I was just

400
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:17,720
getting busted all the time and there

401
00:22:14,569 --> 00:22:23,419
was a concept that it had the clinician

402
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:27,130
of smuggling you know going too far so

403
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:30,880
the lawyers extent along the cultivation

404
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:34,970
and so on it was incumbent upon somebody

405
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:36,530
to challenge that and the lawyers had no

406
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:38,690
interest in challenging them especially

407
00:22:36,529 --> 00:22:41,869
when they saw was me who they would be

408
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:46,330
representing because I had my own

409
00:22:41,869 --> 00:22:52,539
opinions and so I had to go it alone

410
00:22:46,329 --> 00:22:56,029
often but that worked out better than

411
00:22:52,539 --> 00:23:00,680
being represented by the Warriors who

412
00:22:56,029 --> 00:23:04,099
simply couldn't couldn't keep up with my

413
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:08,080
principles and I had a principled

414
00:23:04,099 --> 00:23:13,549
approach for instance after the

415
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:16,939
transportation was allowed the court

416
00:23:13,549 --> 00:23:18,169
said it's an implicit right well that's

417
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:19,820
going pretty far

418
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:20,990
just nobody ever asked them what do you

419
00:23:19,819 --> 00:23:22,669
think about that and they said well of

420
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:27,079
course you have to be able to carry what

421
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:34,980
you can possess legally and okay yeah

422
00:23:27,079 --> 00:23:38,608
she's right and from then on it was

423
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:41,069
kind of in my ballgame and the lawyers

424
00:23:38,608 --> 00:23:44,249
came forward to say they wanted to

425
00:23:41,069 --> 00:23:47,220
represent me but I feared that they

426
00:23:44,249 --> 00:23:50,149
wouldn't and that's why I went on to do

427
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:56,339
it myself and one of the things is this

428
00:23:50,148 --> 00:23:59,158
1993 it's called a cert petition when I

429
00:23:56,339 --> 00:24:01,259
went through the state courts got denied

430
00:23:59,159 --> 00:24:03,629
in every level you have to be jubilant

431
00:24:01,259 --> 00:24:07,999
about losing so you did to obtain iron

432
00:24:03,628 --> 00:24:12,329
and then I went into the federal courts

433
00:24:07,999 --> 00:24:15,058
and they have a procedure where if you

434
00:24:12,329 --> 00:24:18,888
raise constitutional questions you can

435
00:24:15,058 --> 00:24:22,230
go as high it's the US Supreme Court and

436
00:24:18,888 --> 00:24:25,398
if you only raise statutory you know

437
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:28,950
what the statute says that you can do

438
00:24:25,398 --> 00:24:31,258
they stopped you at the appellate level

439
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:33,028
in the state court so nobody ever gets

440
00:24:31,259 --> 00:24:35,278
to go further because they know exactly

441
00:24:33,028 --> 00:24:38,480
what they're doing and they stopped

442
00:24:35,278 --> 00:24:43,798
almost everybody so I was the Challenger

443
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:46,589
and the court agreed with me that tells

444
00:24:43,798 --> 00:24:51,239
me that our community needs to

445
00:24:46,589 --> 00:24:53,878
understand that the court may be way

446
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:57,929
ahead of us they just have not been

447
00:24:53,878 --> 00:25:03,918
asked the questions by the people who

448
00:24:57,929 --> 00:25:06,389
have a case a proper case uncritical I

449
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:12,389
need to say this one more thing I'm

450
00:25:06,388 --> 00:25:13,878
critical of the wires because they're

451
00:25:12,388 --> 00:25:16,168
too timid

452
00:25:13,878 --> 00:25:18,358
they just think I'll need something

453
00:25:16,169 --> 00:25:20,820
conservative something they'll never go

454
00:25:18,358 --> 00:25:22,558
with us for how do you know you've never

455
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:26,069
asked them the Liberals have never done

456
00:25:22,558 --> 00:25:27,960
anything and they may be more or less

457
00:25:26,069 --> 00:25:30,269
equal and they just be a matter of the

458
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:35,730
times and how are you bringing a case

459
00:25:30,269 --> 00:25:38,788
but my own community did not want me to

460
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:40,829
do that they wanted the lawyers to

461
00:25:38,788 --> 00:25:42,119
handle it but I could see the lawyers

462
00:25:40,829 --> 00:25:46,470
were not

463
00:25:42,119 --> 00:25:55,229
and in one case that were talent that

464
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:59,880
one of the patients to to be exempt

465
00:25:55,230 --> 00:26:02,279
Elva mÃºsica is a extreme patient she

466
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:06,570
couldn't easily die from the brain tumor

467
00:26:02,279 --> 00:26:10,289
so she qualified and as a necessity

468
00:26:06,569 --> 00:26:12,599
patient but most of us are not necessity

469
00:26:10,289 --> 00:26:16,049
patients we will not die or go blind

470
00:26:12,599 --> 00:26:19,109
without it and that's what a necessity

471
00:26:16,049 --> 00:26:21,928
patient is so wouldn't have covered any

472
00:26:19,109 --> 00:26:26,178
of us any of the rest of us and so I

473
00:26:21,929 --> 00:26:29,550
tried to go in there and with my own

474
00:26:26,179 --> 00:26:32,340
brief that would be adopted alongside of

475
00:26:29,549 --> 00:26:34,950
the others in my own current said we

476
00:26:32,339 --> 00:26:40,589
will do nothing to enable you to foil

477
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:42,660
that and because you will make us losers

478
00:26:40,589 --> 00:26:45,029
they didn't understand that now the

479
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:51,450
problem is were already so close to

480
00:26:45,029 --> 00:26:53,549
losing we need help and years later the

481
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:56,220
lawyer came to me ran across the parking

482
00:26:53,549 --> 00:27:00,869
lot to tell me you know we were wrong

483
00:26:56,220 --> 00:27:03,150
about that and we appreciate that so

484
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:05,339
what I was actually during all this time

485
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:08,460
when the back-to-the-landers were making

486
00:27:05,339 --> 00:27:10,919
the difference in the country and paving

487
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:14,579
the way for the rest of us an on forests

488
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:17,190
and there for acquittal sit jury trial

489
00:27:14,579 --> 00:27:18,000
and you know just those are broad

490
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:20,250
shoulders

491
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,789
well that was happening I was doing my

492
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:25,710
best to be prepared for the cannabis

493
00:27:23,789 --> 00:27:29,129
future that was going to be better than

494
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:31,529
what's unfolding right now Thank You

495
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:33,210
pebbles and I actually loved the group

496
00:27:31,529 --> 00:27:34,349
of panels that we have here because I

497
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:36,690
see that we have several different

498
00:27:34,349 --> 00:27:38,250
experiences and perspectives we have two

499
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:40,110
people that were out here growing

500
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:42,569
cannabis living the cannabis lifestyle

501
00:27:40,109 --> 00:27:44,490
and we have pebbles who was down in a

502
00:27:42,569 --> 00:27:46,769
more urban area fighting for us to have

503
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:48,410
these rights that we have now everyone

504
00:27:46,769 --> 00:27:49,910
here contributed in their own

505
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:51,920
to make up the community that we

506
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:53,810
currently have and something that I

507
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:56,630
wanted to make sure we covered today it

508
00:27:53,809 --> 00:27:58,970
was all of your opinions on what is

509
00:27:56,630 --> 00:28:01,970
going what is going on in our community

510
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:05,059
as we move out of prohibition and into

511
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:07,250
regulation hopes and fears how you would

512
00:28:05,059 --> 00:28:09,049
like to see this all play out what are

513
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:11,180
your opinions of what is going on right

514
00:28:09,049 --> 00:28:13,039
now and most importantly how we can

515
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:16,220
preserve our values as a cannabis

516
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:18,049
community as we move forward so whoever

517
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:34,700
has the first thought feel free to jump

518
00:28:18,049 --> 00:28:37,490
in I never thought that when

519
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:40,640
legalization came that that it would

520
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:45,289
look like it is unfolded where we are

521
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:49,670
today not sure what I was imagining to

522
00:28:45,289 --> 00:28:52,940
look like but after having done a fair

523
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:55,029
amount of research on alcohol

524
00:28:52,940 --> 00:29:00,380
prohibition I mean that's kind of a

525
00:28:55,029 --> 00:29:02,420
somewhat of an example to drug it kind

526
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:03,620
of messes with your consciousness a

527
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:09,380
little bit depending on how much you

528
00:29:03,619 --> 00:29:13,309
consume that had a about 12 year ago

529
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:19,730
have a shamanic and once that was lifted

530
00:29:13,309 --> 00:29:23,299
then huge industries was created it was

531
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:26,839
already a huge industry right it was

532
00:29:23,299 --> 00:29:30,319
already a huge industry in people making

533
00:29:26,839 --> 00:29:39,919
their own bathtub gin which really

534
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:42,079
fueled the Jazz time period but it

535
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:44,120
really wasn't a good template for for

536
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:45,669
cannabis but as you look around it

537
00:29:44,119 --> 00:29:48,199
really weren't too many good templates

538
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:50,140
nicotine where tobacco never had any

539
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:53,370
prohibition so

540
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:59,310
can't really in its a it's a drug and

541
00:29:53,369 --> 00:30:02,069
it's destroyed and continues to destroy

542
00:29:59,309 --> 00:30:06,399
thousands of wives a year

543
00:30:02,069 --> 00:30:11,710
unlike cannabis which which doesn't we

544
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:15,730
now know it's a medicine so where we are

545
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:18,360
at today I mean I just the talk this

546
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:21,549
weekend is I just found out about it but

547
00:30:18,359 --> 00:30:26,859
Flo canna is gonna be on featured on 60

548
00:30:21,549 --> 00:30:28,659
minutes tomorrow night which I kind of

549
00:30:26,859 --> 00:30:30,429
grew up watching 60 minutes and it was

550
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:32,350
you know really important TV show and

551
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:35,680
the whole family would sit around Sunday

552
00:30:32,349 --> 00:30:37,539
night and watch 60 minutes and so for

553
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:41,740
them to come here to Mendocino County

554
00:30:37,539 --> 00:30:43,480
and to be documenting our story is is

555
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:45,759
fascinating and I understand Casey

556
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:50,259
O'Neil is also gonna be part of the show

557
00:30:45,759 --> 00:30:52,509
so that's exciting to hear can't wait to

558
00:30:50,259 --> 00:30:59,230
see it it says the electricity comes

559
00:30:52,509 --> 00:31:02,440
back on bet yeah you know predicting the

560
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:07,450
future is always a pretty iffy I've

561
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:11,860
never been very good at it but big

562
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:14,340
industry certainly has shown up and I've

563
00:31:11,859 --> 00:31:19,449
seen personally so many mom and pops

564
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:21,549
happy to fold up and and sell their

565
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:25,049
property and move on because they just

566
00:31:21,549 --> 00:31:27,759
haven't been able to afford the

567
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:32,139
licensing process or figure out the

568
00:31:27,759 --> 00:31:34,930
paperwork and so we've lost a lot of the

569
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:39,310
the culture that came here in the late

570
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:40,870
60s in the 70s and 80s that Hill I'm not

571
00:31:39,309 --> 00:31:43,919
sure of paving the way is already a

572
00:31:40,869 --> 00:31:50,169
metaphor but did a lot of the groundwork

573
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:51,490
the many of us benefiting from just some

574
00:31:50,170 --> 00:31:53,670
thoughts on it pebbles you want to jump

575
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:53,670
in

576
00:31:54,420 --> 00:32:05,910
I feel like it's a time warp we are not

577
00:32:01,849 --> 00:32:09,049
experiencing something that is normal or

578
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:16,290
smooth in any way we're just like this

579
00:32:09,049 --> 00:32:23,940
and it's nothing like the people who

580
00:32:16,289 --> 00:32:27,569
imagined just cut the punishments would

581
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:30,330
be the next phase impunity bet there's

582
00:32:27,569 --> 00:32:33,659
nothing to do with this innocent benign

583
00:32:30,329 --> 00:32:35,879
herb and the people who are associated

584
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:37,470
with it that's our crime is the

585
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:40,850
Association we have the right to

586
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:46,500
associate the First Amendment says so

587
00:32:40,849 --> 00:32:52,139
but but then his reality is that it's

588
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:57,859
the most popular plant drug on earth the

589
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:57,860
most lucrative and we were the

590
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:06,029
caregivers the caretakers the stewards

591
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:10,950
of the plant and the environment all of

592
00:33:06,029 --> 00:33:15,000
these decades are the ones that have the

593
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:17,519
upper hand that is being taken away they

594
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,829
are trying to steal the knowledgebase

595
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:23,430
through these regulations that make no

596
00:33:19,829 --> 00:33:26,220
sense the regulations that would make

597
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:29,519
sense is that they went to the people

598
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:32,720
who are to be regulated and sat down

599
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:35,579
with those people and said let's have

600
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:37,259
some kind of a roundtable here and come

601
00:33:35,579 --> 00:33:41,629
up with something that we can all live

602
00:33:37,259 --> 00:33:47,400
with they did not do that they created

603
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:50,270
their own concept of the green rush that

604
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:55,500
was going to come to the county and

605
00:33:50,269 --> 00:33:58,829
imposed it and I think they're about 300

606
00:33:55,500 --> 00:34:02,519
people in in Mendocino County out of

607
00:33:58,829 --> 00:34:06,210
what 10,000 families and wine waiting

608
00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:10,079
for that proverbial permit

609
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:15,599
and they're toying with us because we're

610
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:18,779
in between prohibition and a just

611
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:22,789
regulation reasonable regulation or

612
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:22,790
in-between there were nowhere near and

613
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:29,990
they have put in place five different

614
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:34,379
agricultural commissioners to employ it

615
00:34:29,989 --> 00:34:39,419
but they all quit or been fired within

616
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:44,280
days every single one of them it's you

617
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:46,650
know it's it's proof that they're doing

618
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:50,010
it backwards one of those air

619
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:53,430
conditioners what's his name just just

620
00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:55,020
walked away it's Italy they just are

621
00:34:53,429 --> 00:34:56,639
just not doing it right there they

622
00:34:55,019 --> 00:34:59,070
should go home the classrooms up they

623
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:03,150
should start with what exists and work

624
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:07,400
from that and his idea was the opposite

625
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:07,400
of what's going on now and I feel that

626
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:17,369
regulation has put us as interpreting as

627
00:35:13,139 --> 00:35:26,339
a community we are very vulnerable under

628
00:35:17,369 --> 00:35:32,029
this new policy which is to go after any

629
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:32,030
and all permitted Gardens

630
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:42,510
judging whether 300 come out of 10,000

631
00:35:38,929 --> 00:35:46,129
and that's because we're waiting to see

632
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:52,140
how if it opens up that there's anything

633
00:35:46,130 --> 00:35:54,840
to help us survive that the purpose of

634
00:35:52,139 --> 00:35:59,219
that is to basically take it all away

635
00:35:54,840 --> 00:36:01,350
from us to leave us very reduced in our

636
00:35:59,219 --> 00:36:03,569
power they do not want to share power

637
00:36:01,349 --> 00:36:07,170
with the cannabis community which we

638
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:09,750
want to do that's why we were sharing

639
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:14,820
our knowledge we'd love to do that we

640
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:16,900
have 40 years of heritage and hand on

641
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:18,519
experience and then

642
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:20,380
taking advantage of it because they

643
00:36:18,518 --> 00:36:22,538
don't know the time of day they think it

644
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:24,539
will work this other way and I think

645
00:36:22,539 --> 00:36:27,130
we're showing them that it will not work

646
00:36:24,539 --> 00:36:29,920
but meanwhile the corporations are

647
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:34,930
coming in and the corporations were let

648
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:38,588
in by the government that 5-year plan

649
00:36:34,929 --> 00:36:42,190
that's input up 64 just disappeared

650
00:36:38,588 --> 00:36:45,248
that was the leg in just disappeared

651
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:49,929
and so the corporations went in ahead of

652
00:36:45,248 --> 00:36:53,649
the basic regulations and they are in

653
00:36:49,929 --> 00:36:55,808
place right now many of our own people

654
00:36:53,650 --> 00:37:00,400
are getting ready to settle and so on

655
00:36:55,809 --> 00:37:03,009
and it's when you're in a hole what do

656
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:05,769
you do you you reach out for hands to

657
00:37:03,009 --> 00:37:08,829
help you out and I feel that's what the

658
00:37:05,768 --> 00:37:10,419
community needs to do we need to talk

659
00:37:08,829 --> 00:37:12,099
about this hole that we're in that

660
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:13,960
they're putting us in in the world I

661
00:37:12,099 --> 00:37:17,410
want them to put us in because we don't

662
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:20,769
know what to do about it that will be

663
00:37:17,409 --> 00:37:23,558
effective so I'm suggesting there were

664
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:27,778
there a few of us who've been talking

665
00:37:23,559 --> 00:37:33,099
for over a year about an elders Council

666
00:37:27,778 --> 00:37:35,469
that will guide the ship that's coming

667
00:37:33,099 --> 00:37:38,039
down whatever it may be something very

668
00:37:35,469 --> 00:37:41,618
grassroots community-based

669
00:37:38,039 --> 00:37:45,009
that was structure you know the dreaded

670
00:37:41,619 --> 00:37:50,470
idea because we don't have any we don't

671
00:37:45,009 --> 00:37:52,929
have a voice a cannabis voice and so

672
00:37:50,469 --> 00:37:58,778
there are four of us who matured montz

673
00:37:52,929 --> 00:38:03,518
them who have agreed to take off a plan

674
00:37:58,778 --> 00:38:04,929
and a skeleton of what an elders council

675
00:38:03,518 --> 00:38:07,479
would be basically it would help

676
00:38:04,929 --> 00:38:12,940
preserve the culture enhance the culture

677
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:16,498
and great you know developments as they

678
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:18,179
come through and give to the community a

679
00:38:16,498 --> 00:38:21,848
non-biased

680
00:38:18,179 --> 00:38:26,108
with no agenda kind of truth you know

681
00:38:21,849 --> 00:38:27,220
right now governor Newsom has given the

682
00:38:26,108 --> 00:38:30,759
order or

683
00:38:27,219 --> 00:38:33,989
to the national guard on the Mexican

684
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:39,700
border to go up to the Mendocino County

685
00:38:33,989 --> 00:38:44,439
forests and rid the force of the people

686
00:38:39,699 --> 00:38:46,809
who have unpermitted grows well now that

687
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:50,769
they've moved out of the forest into the

688
00:38:46,809 --> 00:38:54,389
general population they've removed the

689
00:38:50,769 --> 00:38:59,500
forest land as a limit so any

690
00:38:54,389 --> 00:39:03,608
unpermitted grows our target now there

691
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:07,750
was a letter in the ABA a few weeks ago

692
00:39:03,608 --> 00:39:12,699
from someone in at seven plants he was

693
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:14,920
crying he was so furious as he told his

694
00:39:12,699 --> 00:39:17,769
story they came after me for one

695
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:22,630
additional planet and they took all my

696
00:39:17,769 --> 00:39:26,019
genetics years of genetics and woman is

697
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:28,480
saying only than hundreds only thousand

698
00:39:26,019 --> 00:39:31,420
so there was one there were 65 plants

699
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:33,760
it doesn't mention along with seven and

700
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:37,530
so it's because they're preserving their

701
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:41,470
interest to keep control in this

702
00:39:37,530 --> 00:39:46,560
transitional period of time so it's in

703
00:39:41,469 --> 00:39:46,559
our interest to get control of ourselves

704
00:39:46,949 --> 00:39:54,429
you know to start with who we are have

705
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:59,530
emails is the easy way to go and just

706
00:39:54,429 --> 00:40:03,219
how do we imagine doing this and maybe

707
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:05,050
monthly you know gatherings of people in

708
00:40:03,219 --> 00:40:09,429
each other's homes where you can toke

709
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:12,310
and bring the music back and having our

710
00:40:09,429 --> 00:40:14,828
culture since only take it that way but

711
00:40:12,309 --> 00:40:17,289
something that would move out of

712
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:25,140
prohibition where we you know haven't

713
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:28,630
don't talk to each other in so vents

714
00:40:25,139 --> 00:40:32,108
it's I feel the plant will take this

715
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:34,579
will guide us to the best place and that

716
00:40:32,108 --> 00:40:36,170
the arguments are on our side and there

717
00:40:34,579 --> 00:40:40,489
against those who are trying to keep

718
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:42,380
control well they never earned it they

719
00:40:40,489 --> 00:40:45,019
never did anything to came along and

720
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:46,240
trying to steal it and we can't let them

721
00:40:45,019 --> 00:40:51,110
do it

722
00:40:46,239 --> 00:40:55,969
well I have ideas as well and I didn't

723
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:58,130
know about some concepts but the first

724
00:40:55,969 --> 00:41:01,119
thing I think is missing well the world

725
00:40:58,130 --> 00:41:04,910
is in chaos and many of our systems are

726
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:07,549
flowing down and we're seeing them all

727
00:41:04,909 --> 00:41:09,889
we're seeing them all decaying and

728
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:13,039
breaking up and we know what they are

729
00:41:09,889 --> 00:41:15,980
and primarily it's our political system

730
00:41:13,039 --> 00:41:18,889
and so we're trying with what is said

731
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:22,490
here to break into a broken system that

732
00:41:18,889 --> 00:41:25,099
has to be repaired I do feel that there

733
00:41:22,489 --> 00:41:27,889
is a mistake that has been made right

734
00:41:25,099 --> 00:41:30,589
along and and we need to have a real

735
00:41:27,889 --> 00:41:33,170
green movement that this plant is an

736
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:36,350
agricultural plant and it needs to be

737
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:38,659
taxed like tomatoes and everyone can

738
00:41:36,349 --> 00:41:40,730
grow it and that and of course there's a

739
00:41:38,659 --> 00:41:44,750
medical division and that is a

740
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:47,030
specialized unit but but really there

741
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:50,659
are many intoxicating plants that are

742
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:54,350
already in use as agriculture you can

743
00:41:50,659 --> 00:42:04,369
buy your hemp a you can buy kava you can

744
00:41:54,349 --> 00:42:06,769
buy well other things but I know that

745
00:42:04,369 --> 00:42:09,349
there are many many more and all of

746
00:42:06,769 --> 00:42:12,889
these plants have a healing side and

747
00:42:09,349 --> 00:42:17,089
Anna medicinal side and we need a green

748
00:42:12,889 --> 00:42:19,879
like the Green Party of marijuana so

749
00:42:17,090 --> 00:42:23,210
that we think of it as an agricultural

750
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:26,150
plan it is definitely honest farming it

751
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:29,449
definitely has the benefits of home life

752
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:31,940
with a family that can support its

753
00:42:29,449 --> 00:42:34,759
children and not be have any kind of

754
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:37,519
criminal and we have to work to repeal

755
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:39,860
any kind of federal law that is still in

756
00:42:37,519 --> 00:42:42,199
existence while that law was in

757
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:45,470
existence and while the politics are

758
00:42:42,199 --> 00:42:48,859
broken everything is corrupted in in a

759
00:42:45,469 --> 00:42:54,189
way that makes makes it go industrial

760
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:57,140
and package and and confusing and and

761
00:42:54,190 --> 00:43:00,050
there's no education to dealing with the

762
00:42:57,139 --> 00:43:01,940
amount of products that are here and

763
00:43:00,050 --> 00:43:04,580
basically what we're dealing with

764
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:14,750
something that can grow like tomatoes or

765
00:43:04,579 --> 00:43:16,549
mint or or lemongrass or oregano we need

766
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:20,360
to be able to have that kind of freedom

767
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:23,030
and it is a it is a linked to the

768
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:25,789
freedom many of us have been political

769
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:30,730
activists and we've seen freedoms

770
00:43:25,789 --> 00:43:34,250
continuously have to be brought down

771
00:43:30,730 --> 00:43:38,030
brought to its level of what it is right

772
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:40,489
now our freedoms have taken away by

773
00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:43,280
playing this political game we really

774
00:43:40,489 --> 00:43:46,399
need a green movement it is agriculture

775
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:48,740
we need to keep using that word and we

776
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:51,050
need to encourage growers and educate

777
00:43:48,739 --> 00:43:54,199
them and as a matter of fact it is

778
00:43:51,050 --> 00:43:56,920
happening in Willets I know in limits I

779
00:43:54,199 --> 00:44:01,399
think there's going to be a very large

780
00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:06,440
hydroponic marijuana grow that is

781
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:10,430
commercial so there's there's definitely

782
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:13,450
a need for it to be an agricultural plan

783
00:44:10,429 --> 00:44:17,299
that is popularized with medicinal

784
00:44:13,449 --> 00:44:20,659
specialties I don't see the political

785
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:23,480
game it is too corrupt we see how it is

786
00:44:20,659 --> 00:44:28,069
right from the top all the way down to

787
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:31,159
the bottom with lots of paola and lots

788
00:44:28,070 --> 00:44:35,630
of corruption and and that's misleading

789
00:44:31,159 --> 00:44:38,659
we where farmers and and it's natural

790
00:44:35,630 --> 00:44:47,059
for us to create and grow to grow and

791
00:44:38,659 --> 00:44:48,699
create products from our work when this

792
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:52,099
was called the New World

793
00:44:48,699 --> 00:44:58,369
all the new colonists who came to the

794
00:44:52,099 --> 00:45:03,710
new world were given seats to grow to

795
00:44:58,369 --> 00:45:05,029
grow him and you had to sign on if

796
00:45:03,710 --> 00:45:07,119
you're gonna come to the New World and

797
00:45:05,030 --> 00:45:11,269
you're gonna become an ant farmer and

798
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:16,210
people didn't till they didn't and back

799
00:45:11,269 --> 00:45:21,079
then the big drug was team okay

800
00:45:16,210 --> 00:45:32,360
remember the Boston Tea Party politics

801
00:45:21,079 --> 00:45:34,429
taxes we've really lost our way I want

802
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:36,019
to bring up a dear friend of some of

803
00:45:34,429 --> 00:45:38,389
ours here in the room

804
00:45:36,019 --> 00:45:40,309
Julie Terrell Oh has been campaigning

805
00:45:38,389 --> 00:45:44,059
along with Scott magazine's updated

806
00:45:40,309 --> 00:45:51,219
she's calling the green Renaissance and

807
00:45:44,059 --> 00:45:51,219
I think that's a great word use and

808
00:45:51,699 --> 00:45:58,129
something to think about rather than the

809
00:45:54,170 --> 00:46:02,450
Green Rush it's a green right we need to

810
00:45:58,130 --> 00:46:08,539
look closely at that well I think that

811
00:46:02,449 --> 00:46:10,099
um politics is belongs to them if you

812
00:46:08,539 --> 00:46:13,279
guys made this year ago I would have

813
00:46:10,099 --> 00:46:18,199
denied it but I think it's very clear

814
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:21,110
and the culture belongs to us and we're

815
00:46:18,199 --> 00:46:23,869
putting way too much energy over the

816
00:46:21,110 --> 00:46:26,840
years myself included into 20 to

817
00:46:23,869 --> 00:46:29,329
influence their politics when the Gordy

818
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:33,289
got this plan that the they'd been

819
00:46:29,329 --> 00:46:36,739
nurturing for years pretty much going

820
00:46:33,289 --> 00:46:41,779
forward as anticipated much to my

821
00:46:36,739 --> 00:46:45,069
surprise our input since we didn't have

822
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:48,680
any effect on prop 64 we he dropped out

823
00:46:45,070 --> 00:46:53,630
and did not contribute from night from

824
00:46:48,679 --> 00:46:56,299
the 2010 election to the 2016 election

825
00:46:53,630 --> 00:46:58,480
and six years after Richard Lee's we

826
00:46:56,300 --> 00:47:02,560
just didn't do it we were fighting

827
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:05,559
each other over nuances we am not

828
00:47:02,559 --> 00:47:10,420
unified well enough to pull off anything

829
00:47:05,559 --> 00:47:12,250
like a unified action and that's where

830
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:16,690
we have to start with ourselves I'm

831
00:47:12,250 --> 00:47:21,719
thinking that I'm gonna pass this around

832
00:47:16,690 --> 00:47:26,559
this is the invention of the century

833
00:47:21,719 --> 00:47:29,129
this is a prototypes all-in-one what's

834
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:33,090
it's brass is unbreakable brass you can

835
00:47:29,130 --> 00:47:33,090
put a truck over it

836
00:47:37,559 --> 00:47:42,429
Richard and his family produced it and

837
00:47:41,079 --> 00:47:45,819
there are lots of other little

838
00:47:42,429 --> 00:47:53,049
inventions like this that are just you

839
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:56,410
know unnoticed I recognized that we

840
00:47:53,050 --> 00:48:00,120
could bring to gatherings that we have

841
00:47:56,409 --> 00:48:03,190
you know that thing that covers a fight

842
00:48:00,119 --> 00:48:06,539
so that the herb doesn't fall out it's

843
00:48:03,190 --> 00:48:11,019
just like a little rubber band and and

844
00:48:06,539 --> 00:48:20,889
three turns out well five had five holes

845
00:48:11,019 --> 00:48:23,949
to begin with in the beginning was the

846
00:48:20,889 --> 00:48:25,750
one with the the heat shield on to keep

847
00:48:23,949 --> 00:48:29,559
you from burning your fingers because of

848
00:48:25,750 --> 00:48:35,170
morass so we in our factory we called

849
00:48:29,559 --> 00:48:41,019
this one stake sites and it took getting

850
00:48:35,170 --> 00:48:43,240
ripped off by by somebody with a lot of

851
00:48:41,019 --> 00:48:47,800
money that saw us selling a lot of these

852
00:48:43,239 --> 00:48:51,879
on Telegraph Avenue and he ripped us off

853
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:55,539
and put him in it he had a he had an

854
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:58,930
idea to capitalize on the culture and

855
00:48:55,539 --> 00:49:01,900
the pipe sale he goes I'm gonna itch the

856
00:48:58,929 --> 00:49:03,819
name tomato in it and put it in a tin

857
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:06,849
can and seal it up and put a tomato

858
00:49:03,820 --> 00:49:09,900
label on it see he just he made a cheap

859
00:49:06,849 --> 00:49:09,900
gimmick out of it and

860
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:16,049
back then we didn't have a name it

861
00:49:12,989 --> 00:49:20,939
wasn't called pole pipe we had a we had

862
00:49:16,048 --> 00:49:22,588
a name and called contrivance we were

863
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:24,750
trying to figure out what it was that we

864
00:49:22,588 --> 00:49:26,460
we knew what we had but you know boy

865
00:49:24,750 --> 00:49:28,909
coming up with a label is really

866
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:32,010
important so it took getting ripped off

867
00:49:28,909 --> 00:49:35,038
for us to put our heads together and to

868
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:38,220
reach out and pull in a few close

869
00:49:35,039 --> 00:49:40,890
friends and we did and immediately we

870
00:49:38,219 --> 00:49:44,608
created synergy and one of the guys came

871
00:49:40,889 --> 00:49:48,500
up he meant to say prototype and he

872
00:49:44,608 --> 00:49:50,818
accidentally said prototype and we went

873
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:51,989
that's it Eureka

874
00:49:50,818 --> 00:49:54,269
of course you didn't have the internet

875
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:58,139
back then yeah so it took a long time to

876
00:49:54,269 --> 00:50:00,690
figure out navigate the legal system and

877
00:49:58,139 --> 00:50:01,139
and we did though but it was a mere slip

878
00:50:00,690 --> 00:50:03,389
of the tongue

879
00:50:01,139 --> 00:50:06,358
it was reaching out creating synergy

880
00:50:03,389 --> 00:50:10,348
with like-minded people and you know

881
00:50:06,358 --> 00:50:12,150
this this guy we just knocked him out of

882
00:50:10,349 --> 00:50:15,740
his orbit because he had a lot of money

883
00:50:12,150 --> 00:50:15,740
we didn't but we were clever lads

884
00:50:16,730 --> 00:50:20,278
forgive what my point was other than

885
00:50:18,869 --> 00:50:24,108
this this one's a lot older than that

886
00:50:20,278 --> 00:50:29,969
one this would go back to probably about

887
00:50:24,108 --> 00:50:33,420
73 74 and it's still the improvement one

888
00:50:29,969 --> 00:50:35,669
this is a 1.0 that's its repoint oh and

889
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:38,579
so basically the three points hit it

890
00:50:35,670 --> 00:50:41,700
actually has two new patents on it that

891
00:50:38,579 --> 00:50:44,220
this one does not have and we have a we

892
00:50:41,699 --> 00:50:49,919
have a 50th anniversary in the wings

893
00:50:44,219 --> 00:50:51,480
our 50th is Wow right at the end of old

894
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:53,789
compass it's gonna be our 50th

895
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:57,809
anniversary we should give them get them

896
00:50:53,789 --> 00:51:02,160
a fundraiser because I think it's the

897
00:50:57,809 --> 00:51:06,150
oldest truly mendocino based invention

898
00:51:02,159 --> 00:51:09,298
in the cannabis culture I might be wrong

899
00:51:06,150 --> 00:51:11,750
but in my knowledge of what's going

900
00:51:09,298 --> 00:51:14,389
around nobody has even come

901
00:51:11,750 --> 00:51:18,440
close to the 15 years the prototype is

902
00:51:14,389 --> 00:51:21,319
stuck it out and they're having trouble

903
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:24,590
just like any small business defendant

904
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:27,349
this small business all over again so I

905
00:51:24,590 --> 00:51:30,608
really feel like we should give him some

906
00:51:27,349 --> 00:51:35,119
space of the Emerald triangle

907
00:51:30,608 --> 00:51:38,509
centrality and the 50th anniversary of

908
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:41,170
what a brass pride because there's glass

909
00:51:38,510 --> 00:51:47,240
everywhere when you go into spark

910
00:51:41,170 --> 00:51:55,159
there's nothing but fast they take me

911
00:51:47,239 --> 00:52:00,608
money over here in on the bottom no it's

912
00:51:55,159 --> 00:52:00,608
an anomaly we're a 50 year old startup

913
00:52:03,849 --> 00:52:06,950
one of many treasures that you brought

914
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:08,840
with you today

915
00:52:06,949 --> 00:52:10,639
so would you like to take some time to

916
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:12,800
talk about your wonderful archival

917
00:52:10,639 --> 00:52:15,460
collection yeah okay if you twist my arm

918
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:17,390
no I did I did write something up okay

919
00:52:15,460 --> 00:52:20,720
which I could breeze through it pretty

920
00:52:17,389 --> 00:52:24,079
quick yes please um I'll go something

921
00:52:20,719 --> 00:52:26,779
like this in 1970 my older brother Phil

922
00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:30,170
designed and fabricated a unique smoking

923
00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:33,560
pipe pulled out and it was called the

924
00:52:30,170 --> 00:52:35,539
contrivance and we knew that Denver was

925
00:52:33,559 --> 00:52:38,150
not a place to launch this business

926
00:52:35,539 --> 00:52:42,320
because nothing was happening in Denver

927
00:52:38,150 --> 00:52:45,710
and in 1970 the laws were very very much

928
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:47,119
a red state and but San Francisco is

929
00:52:45,710 --> 00:52:49,010
where the totem drum of the

930
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:50,869
counterculture was being beat and so

931
00:52:49,010 --> 00:52:53,060
that's where rolling stone was and

932
00:52:50,869 --> 00:52:57,769
that's where the that's where it was

933
00:52:53,059 --> 00:53:01,820
happening and so he moved to San

934
00:52:57,769 --> 00:53:04,009
Francisco to launch this pipe dream and

935
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:05,990
as soon as he could he called me up and

936
00:53:04,010 --> 00:53:08,119
said you know it was a long-distance

937
00:53:05,989 --> 00:53:11,179
phone call telephones were kind of a big

938
00:53:08,119 --> 00:53:13,369
deal back then every called me up and he

939
00:53:11,179 --> 00:53:16,190
said I got a small warehouse space Rick

940
00:53:13,369 --> 00:53:19,990
why don't you come on out so I came on

941
00:53:16,190 --> 00:53:19,990
out and and

942
00:53:20,829 --> 00:53:27,420
I just gotten my my draft card number

943
00:53:24,119 --> 00:53:31,739
and back then there was a very unpopular

944
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:34,420
war going on called the Vietnam War and

945
00:53:31,739 --> 00:53:36,459
I've got a huge box of goodies but

946
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:40,599
there's just no longer all but basically

947
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:43,889
the Vietnam War was the United States

948
00:53:40,599 --> 00:53:46,480
had only been in it for 1415 years and

949
00:53:43,889 --> 00:53:51,009
the country has been a war for a

950
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:52,510
thousand years of exploitation but

951
00:53:51,010 --> 00:53:54,610
anyway we were the latest the French

952
00:53:52,510 --> 00:53:57,910
pulled the Americans into it and the

953
00:53:54,610 --> 00:54:00,130
wars always need young men and so it was

954
00:53:57,909 --> 00:54:02,889
a big appetite and so they created a

955
00:54:00,130 --> 00:54:04,990
lottery everyone's birthday went on a

956
00:54:02,889 --> 00:54:07,059
ping-pong ball went in a big hopper and

957
00:54:04,989 --> 00:54:10,179
your fate is determined by the Pick of

958
00:54:07,059 --> 00:54:13,269
the draw and I had a lot of friends who

959
00:54:10,179 --> 00:54:14,980
got pulled out pretty early and you

960
00:54:13,269 --> 00:54:18,699
could either leave the country go to

961
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:21,369
Canada or Mexico or you're up and or you

962
00:54:18,699 --> 00:54:24,189
could go to you could go to college or

963
00:54:21,369 --> 00:54:27,130
university and I chose that one I didn't

964
00:54:24,190 --> 00:54:29,500
want to leave the country anyway

965
00:54:27,130 --> 00:54:32,619
mine was the last thing pong ball pulled

966
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:37,119
out Wow that meant I was never gonna see

967
00:54:32,619 --> 00:54:40,630
service so I didn't need to stay in a

968
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:42,549
place that wasn't fulfilling me so I

969
00:54:40,630 --> 00:54:49,150
dropped out and I moved to San Francisco

970
00:54:42,550 --> 00:54:51,460
to also chase the pipe dream and it took

971
00:54:49,150 --> 00:54:53,710
a few years of making a lot of mistakes

972
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:57,970
we made every mistake you could for a

973
00:54:53,710 --> 00:54:59,679
young star we knew nothing except we

974
00:54:57,969 --> 00:55:01,829
were clever young lads that were just

975
00:54:59,679 --> 00:55:04,899
resilient and just kept going back and

976
00:55:01,829 --> 00:55:07,090
you know you fall down you get up and

977
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:09,250
you learn to walk you through crawling

978
00:55:07,090 --> 00:55:11,350
and so forth so I was about six years

979
00:55:09,250 --> 00:55:13,869
before we really started figuring out

980
00:55:11,349 --> 00:55:16,989
our price points and how to set up an

981
00:55:13,869 --> 00:55:18,940
assembly line in the Bay Area was very

982
00:55:16,989 --> 00:55:21,489
good to us it was a very creative place

983
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:23,530
to be and I'd already told you the story

984
00:55:21,489 --> 00:55:29,109
about getting knocked off by day yeah by

985
00:55:23,530 --> 00:55:30,550
the tomato and so we we created synergy

986
00:55:29,110 --> 00:55:33,280
we pulled in a couple of new partners

987
00:55:30,550 --> 00:55:36,010
and that we all had skin and the

988
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:39,519
so again Berkeley was an exciting place

989
00:55:36,010 --> 00:55:42,820
to be San Francisco area we

990
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:47,769
incorporators we created the corporation

991
00:55:42,820 --> 00:55:51,690
one of my partners Larry Todd too many

992
00:55:47,769 --> 00:55:56,650
people know him as dr. atomic he was a

993
00:55:51,690 --> 00:56:01,300
cartoonist and he was published with

994
00:55:56,650 --> 00:56:04,539
last-gasp in San Francisco and he was

995
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:07,720
good friends with you know the creators

996
00:56:04,539 --> 00:56:10,869
of the furry freak brothers and fits the

997
00:56:07,719 --> 00:56:15,159
cat and all of these other really

998
00:56:10,869 --> 00:56:18,909
curious fun to read publications and it

999
00:56:15,159 --> 00:56:21,730
really helped to normalize the hysteria

1000
00:56:18,909 --> 00:56:25,269
around cannabis marijuana as it was

1001
00:56:21,730 --> 00:56:29,769
called and so meeting him was a game

1002
00:56:25,269 --> 00:56:33,340
changer because he could not not create

1003
00:56:29,769 --> 00:56:38,139
incredible art and I had one of his

1004
00:56:33,340 --> 00:56:40,630
comics right here with me so this isn't

1005
00:56:38,139 --> 00:56:42,039
him but this is like furry freak

1006
00:56:40,630 --> 00:56:45,700
brothers everyone knows the furry freak

1007
00:56:42,039 --> 00:56:52,300
brothers natsume no dr. Tommy with dr.

1008
00:56:45,699 --> 00:56:54,789
atomic was absolutely epic and anyway

1009
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:57,519
you know he he took our graphics

1010
00:56:54,789 --> 00:57:02,829
department and really started doing some

1011
00:56:57,519 --> 00:57:06,059
incredible things and some of his right

1012
00:57:02,829 --> 00:57:09,880
behind Tim there is it's called the

1013
00:57:06,059 --> 00:57:35,759
classic a mansion and that's a scene

1014
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:41,769
that many of us recognize we don't exist

1015
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:48,580
what's that oh it's it was out of memory

1016
00:57:41,769 --> 00:58:01,679
it's just it's an iconic image of these

1017
00:57:48,579 --> 00:58:06,099
up in that allows you to build your own

1018
00:58:01,679 --> 00:58:08,049
specifications you only get two

1019
00:58:06,099 --> 00:58:13,179
inspections is supposed to one for every

1020
00:58:08,050 --> 00:58:15,610
process along the way so anyway business

1021
00:58:13,179 --> 00:58:18,750
was was looking up and we started doing

1022
00:58:15,610 --> 00:58:22,480
trade shows and I started traveling and

1023
00:58:18,750 --> 00:58:24,369
setting up shops and you know you go to

1024
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:27,369
a new town and you you look for somebody

1025
00:58:24,369 --> 00:58:29,859
with long hair or bell-bottoms and you

1026
00:58:27,369 --> 00:58:33,250
know hey it's a record store in town is

1027
00:58:29,860 --> 00:58:35,470
there a waterbed store in town and you

1028
00:58:33,250 --> 00:58:38,440
know you'd have to seek these things out

1029
00:58:35,469 --> 00:58:41,049
and every once in a while you get lucky

1030
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:43,000
and find a place that would sell music

1031
00:58:41,050 --> 00:58:45,190
or posters or water beds and beanbag

1032
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:49,289
chairs and maybe they had a small pair

1033
00:58:45,190 --> 00:58:53,139
of music so I got to see firsthand this

1034
00:58:49,289 --> 00:58:56,230
this culture sprouting up around the

1035
00:58:53,139 --> 00:58:58,329
country and there was a lot of fun doing

1036
00:58:56,230 --> 00:59:03,000
road trips and trade shows and festivals

1037
00:58:58,329 --> 00:59:07,210
and so forth and in time we started

1038
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:08,739
advertising in magazines and we used to

1039
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:12,280
I started off in Rolling Stone magazine

1040
00:59:08,739 --> 00:59:15,309
but then they they stopped doing that

1041
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:17,650
and so the new kid on the block was this

1042
00:59:15,309 --> 00:59:19,599
one here called high tides so this is

1043
00:59:17,650 --> 00:59:22,000
your first issue right here pretty

1044
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:24,139
amazing and we started we started

1045
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:27,110
advertising in

1046
00:59:24,139 --> 00:59:31,460
times and Larry was doing our incredible

1047
00:59:27,110 --> 00:59:38,840
graphics and sales really started

1048
00:59:31,460 --> 00:59:41,150
picking up and then on a national level

1049
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:44,809
there was a change in presidency and we

1050
00:59:41,150 --> 00:59:50,119
had a a president in there by the name

1051
00:59:44,809 --> 00:59:51,769
of Jimmy Carter and we were all thinking

1052
00:59:50,119 --> 00:59:54,259
the legalization was right around the

1053
00:59:51,769 --> 00:59:57,380
corner his son ship that declared

1054
00:59:54,260 --> 01:00:00,890
publicly that he was smoking pot in the

1055
00:59:57,380 --> 01:00:02,630
White House you know were everyone's

1056
01:00:00,889 --> 01:00:04,639
like yeah it's gonna happen with that

1057
01:00:02,630 --> 01:00:06,170
happening but Dennis strange thing

1058
01:00:04,639 --> 01:00:10,389
happened a guy by the name of Ronald

1059
01:00:06,170 --> 01:00:13,849
Reagan this this former actor and former

1060
01:00:10,389 --> 01:00:16,309
governor of California created this

1061
01:00:13,849 --> 01:00:20,900
political machine and before we knew it

1062
01:00:16,309 --> 01:00:24,799
Carter's out and Reagan's in and things

1063
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:27,680
started getting really nasty and they

1064
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:34,370
indeed crafted this rather draconian law

1065
01:00:27,679 --> 01:00:35,690
on exportation of metal pipes and we'd

1066
01:00:34,369 --> 01:00:37,369
had a good run we fight you know

1067
01:00:35,690 --> 01:00:39,740
legalizations around the corner we're

1068
01:00:37,369 --> 01:00:41,630
gonna we're gonna set this one out we'd

1069
01:00:39,739 --> 01:00:43,609
already taken a lot of arrows in the

1070
01:00:41,630 --> 01:00:47,660
back being up here and then say no

1071
01:00:43,610 --> 01:00:49,490
County our local City Council really

1072
01:00:47,659 --> 01:00:51,949
wanted us to go back to Berkeley and the

1073
01:00:49,489 --> 01:00:54,589
County Board of Supervisors really

1074
01:00:51,949 --> 01:00:56,359
wanted us to go back to Berkeley normal

1075
01:00:54,590 --> 01:00:58,039
wanted to come and represent us because

1076
01:00:56,360 --> 01:01:00,740
we were kind of a high-profile company

1077
01:00:58,039 --> 01:01:04,699
and we didn't want the big attorneys to

1078
01:01:00,739 --> 01:01:08,389
come in we thought that we could handle

1079
01:01:04,699 --> 01:01:12,049
it and so we created a petition and we

1080
01:01:08,389 --> 01:01:13,670
started going around to events wherever

1081
01:01:12,050 --> 01:01:17,480
people were gathering and we got people

1082
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:19,849
to so we got several hundred signatures

1083
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:22,460
on a petition and we went and of the

1084
01:01:19,849 --> 01:01:24,949
City Council and we convinced them that

1085
01:01:22,460 --> 01:01:26,990
that we were good for the community and

1086
01:01:24,949 --> 01:01:31,879
we packed the council chambers with

1087
01:01:26,989 --> 01:01:35,329
everyone that believed in us and so we

1088
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:36,829
got grandfathered in and they wouldn't

1089
01:01:35,329 --> 01:01:37,819
let anyone else in but they drew the

1090
01:01:36,829 --> 01:01:40,400
line

1091
01:01:37,820 --> 01:01:44,090
right behind us so that was kind of

1092
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:46,910
interesting but in 86 this new this new

1093
01:01:44,090 --> 01:01:50,030
federal law came into place and we we

1094
01:01:46,909 --> 01:01:50,480
let someone run the business for us with

1095
01:01:50,030 --> 01:01:53,360
you

1096
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:55,760
you know once again with the agreement

1097
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:58,400
that we want back in when legalization

1098
01:01:55,760 --> 01:02:00,200
is at hand well this guy changed his

1099
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:08,930
mind because it was only a hand shaking

1100
01:02:00,199 --> 01:02:10,909
and you know shame on us but so he made

1101
01:02:08,929 --> 01:02:13,250
millions and we watched it from a

1102
01:02:10,909 --> 01:02:15,710
distance not very far cos he stayed in

1103
01:02:13,250 --> 01:02:18,469
Willows and he made many millions of

1104
01:02:15,710 --> 01:02:25,909
dollars and it was it was kind of tough

1105
01:02:18,469 --> 01:02:27,889
watching and so that the dog that was in

1106
01:02:25,909 --> 01:02:34,579
there so we we let go of the business

1107
01:02:27,889 --> 01:02:37,159
and in 87 and we had no idea that would

1108
01:02:34,579 --> 01:02:40,400
take another 30 years before the tide

1109
01:02:37,159 --> 01:02:46,579
was gonna turn in California anyway and

1110
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:48,410
so strange story is this guy ended up

1111
01:02:46,579 --> 01:02:51,650
getting that we turned the business over

1112
01:02:48,409 --> 01:02:54,379
here and up getting evicted from the

1113
01:02:51,650 --> 01:02:56,300
very shop space that we used to occupy

1114
01:02:54,380 --> 01:03:02,390
in fact it used to be our building and

1115
01:02:56,300 --> 01:03:06,110
so he got evicted and and we're back in

1116
01:03:02,389 --> 01:03:09,199
there making these pipes again he let

1117
01:03:06,110 --> 01:03:12,230
everything lapse and we were able to

1118
01:03:09,199 --> 01:03:16,250
regain our name through the federal

1119
01:03:12,230 --> 01:03:23,539
trademark office and we're proto like

1120
01:03:16,250 --> 01:03:26,690
once again and it's it's it's a quota

1121
01:03:23,539 --> 01:03:29,840
you know popular song it's been a really

1122
01:03:26,690 --> 01:03:32,929
strange long trip but you know we're in

1123
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:36,890
it for the long run and you know two

1124
01:03:32,929 --> 01:03:41,599
generations and the story is still

1125
01:03:36,889 --> 01:03:42,759
unfolding and while I wasn't just

1126
01:03:41,599 --> 01:03:44,079
sitting on my hands

1127
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:48,820
I'll try and wrap this up for you to

1128
01:03:44,079 --> 01:03:51,940
speak real quick here but I I'm just

1129
01:03:48,820 --> 01:03:54,070
gonna read this one here it's 2018 well

1130
01:03:51,940 --> 01:03:58,059
right now this is marks my fiftieth

1131
01:03:54,070 --> 01:03:59,230
anniversary with the plant and well

1132
01:03:58,059 --> 01:04:01,989
let's see if what he said a lot of this

1133
01:03:59,230 --> 01:04:03,789
so I don't think I need to say this at

1134
01:04:01,989 --> 01:04:06,819
all so what I have been doing recently

1135
01:04:03,789 --> 01:04:09,009
though is is I saved everything when I

1136
01:04:06,820 --> 01:04:13,420
sold the business and it turned out to

1137
01:04:09,010 --> 01:04:16,480
be a really fascinating thing my mother

1138
01:04:13,420 --> 01:04:20,200
started me on this wonderful ride by

1139
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:23,920
leaving this publication out my family

1140
01:04:20,199 --> 01:04:25,599
used to subscribe to Life magazine and

1141
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:27,490
so if she left us out for her two

1142
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:35,009
teenage sons to read on the dining room

1143
01:04:27,489 --> 01:04:36,879
table freedom it is but this is the real

1144
01:04:35,010 --> 01:04:40,540
this is a real magazine

1145
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:42,220
towba 31st 1969 so I had no idea that

1146
01:04:40,539 --> 01:04:44,019
this was gonna you know direct my life

1147
01:04:42,219 --> 01:04:46,059
and I don't think she knew either

1148
01:04:44,019 --> 01:04:48,489
because she didn't leave it out there

1149
01:04:46,059 --> 01:04:51,309
for me to get into the in the

1150
01:04:48,489 --> 01:04:53,679
independent so I kind of owe my my

1151
01:04:51,309 --> 01:04:56,289
collection passion to her because she

1152
01:04:53,679 --> 01:05:00,669
used to I just want to show it to the

1153
01:04:56,289 --> 01:05:06,119
camera she was quite the archivist in

1154
01:05:00,670 --> 01:05:08,559
her own right and so I started just

1155
01:05:06,119 --> 01:05:12,159
collecting things that related to the

1156
01:05:08,559 --> 01:05:16,500
culture and I didn't know how much it

1157
01:05:12,159 --> 01:05:19,149
was until I was able to get a a room and

1158
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:21,099
display it all in and I just kept

1159
01:05:19,150 --> 01:05:25,869
bringing it in by the box load and I'm

1160
01:05:21,099 --> 01:05:29,559
like good God and so it took a few years

1161
01:05:25,869 --> 01:05:33,039
to start moving it around and putting

1162
01:05:29,559 --> 01:05:37,690
together a story and the story is the

1163
01:05:33,039 --> 01:05:40,900
emergence of what can be known as a

1164
01:05:37,690 --> 01:05:43,119
counterculture those those of us that

1165
01:05:40,900 --> 01:05:45,369
were principally baby boomers

1166
01:05:43,119 --> 01:05:48,880
up in the in the 50s and the 60s and

1167
01:05:45,369 --> 01:05:54,880
coming of age and it was a turbulent

1168
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:57,970
time and what was you know this is this

1169
01:05:54,880 --> 01:06:00,309
was the peak of the 60s and three months

1170
01:05:57,969 --> 01:06:04,659
after this was Altamont

1171
01:06:00,309 --> 01:06:11,309
and that was the the death knell and you

1172
01:06:04,659 --> 01:06:14,858
know this is August of 1969 and so the

1173
01:06:11,309 --> 01:06:17,890
all the youth you know this came out in

1174
01:06:14,858 --> 01:06:20,920
68 this came out in 1970 sorry and what

1175
01:06:17,889 --> 01:06:22,538
they're telling everyone here is if you

1176
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:25,210
don't like the way things are go buy a

1177
01:06:22,539 --> 01:06:26,559
piece of cheap land doesn't have to be

1178
01:06:25,210 --> 01:06:28,990
in Northern California might be in

1179
01:06:26,559 --> 01:06:30,789
Tennessee it might be in Iowa because

1180
01:06:28,989 --> 01:06:33,489
the culture was everywhere it wasn't

1181
01:06:30,789 --> 01:06:35,319
just in Northern California so in the

1182
01:06:33,489 --> 01:06:38,108
the ads in the back of these are the

1183
01:06:35,318 --> 01:06:39,308
best because people are reaching out

1184
01:06:38,108 --> 01:06:41,730
they're saying looking for like-minded

1185
01:06:39,309 --> 01:06:44,499
people to buy some land together with

1186
01:06:41,730 --> 01:06:46,329
share raising our families together with

1187
01:06:44,498 --> 01:06:47,980
and so forth thing you know I always

1188
01:06:46,329 --> 01:06:52,210
dreamed the building the geodesic dome

1189
01:06:47,980 --> 01:06:54,460
and so be I know a lot of people that

1190
01:06:52,210 --> 01:06:56,230
came here to Northern California as a

1191
01:06:54,460 --> 01:06:58,720
result of these events it's a result of

1192
01:06:56,230 --> 01:07:03,219
this publication so it was it was a very

1193
01:06:58,719 --> 01:07:06,009
seminal piece in the another seminal

1194
01:07:03,219 --> 01:07:09,248
piece was the Whole Earth Catalog which

1195
01:07:06,009 --> 01:07:11,440
came out in 1968 and this was like this

1196
01:07:09,248 --> 01:07:16,538
was an Internet because for the first

1197
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:19,809
time it gave people access to to books

1198
01:07:16,539 --> 01:07:24,130
and tools and ideas and gatherings of

1199
01:07:19,809 --> 01:07:27,009
like-minded people and this this had a

1200
01:07:24,130 --> 01:07:33,460
really good run this this ran from 1968

1201
01:07:27,009 --> 01:07:35,949
until 1960 1994 that was their last year

1202
01:07:33,460 --> 01:07:39,940
that they published and oddly enough I

1203
01:07:35,949 --> 01:07:42,298
was the Internet that that caused them

1204
01:07:39,940 --> 01:07:42,298
to stop

1205
01:07:42,568 --> 01:07:48,429
this is a good time to inter interject

1206
01:07:47,278 --> 01:07:54,509
sinsemilla

1207
01:07:48,429 --> 01:07:55,859
tips was the primary educator of the

1208
01:07:54,509 --> 01:08:00,269
cannabis

1209
01:07:55,860 --> 01:08:03,599
from 1980 to 1990 and then on to 2000

1210
01:08:00,269 --> 01:08:05,820
and he wanted to be here we invited him

1211
01:08:03,599 --> 01:08:10,769
and he said they need to make their

1212
01:08:05,820 --> 01:08:12,720
wishes his best but he is basically here

1213
01:08:10,769 --> 01:08:16,170
in spirit and then also the

1214
01:08:12,719 --> 01:08:17,880
o'Shaughnessy's editor friends are no

1215
01:08:16,170 --> 01:08:21,630
listen valiant he was supposed to be

1216
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:25,550
here and it's enabling he was he's the

1217
01:08:21,630 --> 01:08:30,329
one who kept the medical culture alive

1218
01:08:25,550 --> 01:08:34,460
without o'Shaughnessy's we wouldn't

1219
01:08:30,329 --> 01:08:37,680
really have had anything all this time

1220
01:08:34,460 --> 01:08:42,869
magazine covers the culture although

1221
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:46,289
that came writer and we don't have very

1222
01:08:42,869 --> 01:08:49,229
much because it's a hard life and it's

1223
01:08:46,289 --> 01:08:52,170
usually done by poor people like Fred

1224
01:08:49,229 --> 01:08:56,159
Gardner puts out this tabloid newspaper

1225
01:08:52,170 --> 01:08:58,109
because he's poor and that's just all he

1226
01:08:56,159 --> 01:09:01,880
can never afford to get the job done

1227
01:08:58,109 --> 01:09:05,060
this is this group of people especially

1228
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:08,369
the publication's the editors are

1229
01:09:05,060 --> 01:09:14,220
long-suffering central people in our

1230
01:09:08,369 --> 01:09:17,479
community like virtually nobody else and

1231
01:09:14,220 --> 01:09:21,329
you have the archives to to show that I

1232
01:09:17,479 --> 01:09:24,719
think I feel that writing things down we

1233
01:09:21,329 --> 01:09:27,720
should do more about so as to save it

1234
01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:31,470
otherwise like we talk goes into the

1235
01:09:27,720 --> 01:09:33,838
ether it's very hard to pick up the

1236
01:09:31,470 --> 01:09:37,230
thread from one weight or month to the

1237
01:09:33,838 --> 01:09:39,300
next but when you write it down you have

1238
01:09:37,229 --> 01:09:45,059
a record of it and sometimes you get

1239
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:47,730
somewhere in books and Mohsen Thal was

1240
01:09:45,060 --> 01:09:50,460
saying to Dennis

1241
01:09:47,729 --> 01:09:53,039
Peron you don't have to sell weed you

1242
01:09:50,460 --> 01:09:55,529
know you can do things legitimate Lee

1243
01:09:53,039 --> 01:09:58,199
and he opened up a publishing house and

1244
01:09:55,529 --> 01:10:00,899
was the only one who actually sold weed

1245
01:09:58,199 --> 01:10:03,380
books all of those decades and he

1246
01:10:00,899 --> 01:10:03,379
survives

1247
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:11,059
when you go into a court of law

1248
01:10:07,538 --> 01:10:12,198
write it down you don't laugh you out of

1249
01:10:11,059 --> 01:10:15,099
the courtroom that you don't ever

1250
01:10:12,198 --> 01:10:22,368
written down we have to change from a

1251
01:10:15,099 --> 01:10:27,889
handshake culture to ones that do the

1252
01:10:22,368 --> 01:10:29,978
basic the basics that you must do in

1253
01:10:27,889 --> 01:10:33,409
life to trust the people you work with

1254
01:10:29,979 --> 01:10:36,829
legally binding because you don't have

1255
01:10:33,408 --> 01:10:39,198
to know them very well yes it's on the

1256
01:10:36,828 --> 01:10:41,569
paper what you agreed to you don't have

1257
01:10:39,198 --> 01:10:42,859
to go back and forth we have a real

1258
01:10:41,569 --> 01:10:45,498
problem like that

1259
01:10:42,859 --> 01:10:47,210
a huge problem with that because it

1260
01:10:45,498 --> 01:10:49,010
weren't anything to be written by cops

1261
01:10:47,210 --> 01:10:51,498
okay that the cops are not the problem

1262
01:10:49,010 --> 01:10:54,340
our own community knowing what each

1263
01:10:51,498 --> 01:10:57,349
other or saying and doing is the problem

1264
01:10:54,340 --> 01:11:00,349
keeping an agreement making each other

1265
01:10:57,349 --> 01:11:02,719
accountable that's the problem and as

1266
01:11:00,349 --> 01:11:05,119
we're moving now into this new era in

1267
01:11:02,719 --> 01:11:07,670
our community we do have a great need to

1268
01:11:05,118 --> 01:11:09,799
preserve these stories and it's great

1269
01:11:07,670 --> 01:11:11,599
when we find people like Richard who has

1270
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:14,779
been saving these objects for so many

1271
01:11:11,599 --> 01:11:16,729
years and now it's about how do we take

1272
01:11:14,779 --> 01:11:18,738
these objects that he has in these

1273
01:11:16,729 --> 01:11:21,139
publications and how do we share them

1274
01:11:18,738 --> 01:11:23,149
with the greater community and how do we

1275
01:11:21,139 --> 01:11:25,670
share cecile stories and how do we share

1276
01:11:23,149 --> 01:11:27,469
Pebbles stories and Fred stories and

1277
01:11:25,670 --> 01:11:28,908
Douglass's stories and everyone else's

1278
01:11:27,469 --> 01:11:31,460
stories and make sure that they don't

1279
01:11:28,908 --> 01:11:34,399
get forgotten as we move forward into a

1280
01:11:31,460 --> 01:11:38,319
new time so I'm wondering you have the

1281
01:11:34,399 --> 01:11:41,658
idea of the elders Council I'm wondering

1282
01:11:38,319 --> 01:11:43,728
what each of you think about ways that

1283
01:11:41,658 --> 01:11:46,339
your generation who has paved the way

1284
01:11:43,729 --> 01:11:49,400
for where we are today can interface

1285
01:11:46,340 --> 01:11:51,078
with the younger generation of community

1286
01:11:49,399 --> 01:11:53,719
members so that we can make sure that

1287
01:11:51,078 --> 01:11:55,038
these stories get preserved it's so

1288
01:11:53,719 --> 01:11:56,599
important to share this knowledge

1289
01:11:55,038 --> 01:11:58,788
because I think that the younger

1290
01:11:56,599 --> 01:12:01,099
generation doesn't have the same

1291
01:11:58,788 --> 01:12:02,569
experiences that you all have had I can

1292
01:12:01,099 --> 01:12:05,840
speak for myself I'm a younger

1293
01:12:02,569 --> 01:12:09,828
cultivator we don't have the knowledge

1294
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:11,690
that you all possess and it's really

1295
01:12:09,828 --> 01:12:13,590
important that it gets preserved and

1296
01:12:11,689 --> 01:12:14,928
something that I love about the cannabis

1297
01:12:13,590 --> 01:12:17,849
unity is it's a multi-generational

1298
01:12:14,929 --> 01:12:20,449
community I have many friends in Colo

1299
01:12:17,849 --> 01:12:23,099
that are in their 70s 80s and 90s and

1300
01:12:20,448 --> 01:12:25,019
they share their information so freely

1301
01:12:23,099 --> 01:12:27,510
and it's so valuable but it's not

1302
01:12:25,020 --> 01:12:30,060
possible for every young person to

1303
01:12:27,510 --> 01:12:32,760

1305
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:37,020
important conversation to have and

1309

1324
01:13:35,698 --> 01:13:45,678
make themselves one of them is if you
