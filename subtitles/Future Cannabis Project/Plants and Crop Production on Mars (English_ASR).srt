1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,290
some of the challenges for growing

2
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:06,240
plants in space are basically trying to

3
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:08,250
make them grow in a way that's similar

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,500
to what we experienced them growing on

5
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:13,169
earth with gravity so if you're in space

6
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:16,500
you have no gravity which means it's not

7
00:00:13,169 --> 00:00:18,750
necessarily the plants that are having

8
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,399
any kind of unusual response to the lack

9
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:22,320
of gravity it's all the other physical

10
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:24,299
parameters that the plants require to

11
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,329
grow that you have challenges that you

12
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:30,118
have to be for example water delivery so

13
00:00:27,329 --> 00:00:32,420
if you don't have gravity water doesn't

14
00:00:30,118 --> 00:00:40,980
stay in the pod it floats around or

15
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:42,420
water is has a it's a it's stratified

16
00:00:40,979 --> 00:00:44,640
different in the media that the plants

17
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:47,429
are growing in so on earth where you

18
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,049
have gravity water is added to the top

19
00:00:47,429 --> 00:00:50,939
of the pot it sinks down to the bottom

20
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:53,128
of the pot due to gravity in space it

21
00:00:50,939 --> 00:00:54,689
doesn't so it it's equally distributed

22
00:00:53,128 --> 00:00:56,549
throughout that media because the media

23
00:00:54,689 --> 00:00:58,558
is holding on to the water the roots can

24
00:00:56,549 --> 00:01:02,718
absorb that water out of the media and

25
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:06,810
so people some of the early experiments

26
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:08,400
in growing plants in space we're having

27
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:10,859
to overcome the challenges of water

28
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,118
delivery over watering the plants

29
00:01:10,859 --> 00:01:14,159
because we're used to giving them a

30
00:01:12,118 --> 00:01:15,810
certain amount of water on earth because

31
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,509
of that stratification of water in the

32
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:20,100
pot versus in space the water is equally

33
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:21,840
distributed throughout that media and

34
00:01:20,099 --> 00:01:24,899
therefore you don't have to add as much

35
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:28,170
water so over watering plants is bad for

36
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:29,340
the plants and so that was that was one

37
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:32,400
of the challenges that had to be

38
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:33,810
overcome but overall the plants it

39
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,090
overcome with yes

40
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:39,359
by just simply managing watering

41
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:41,939
protocols water in control but plants

42
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:44,670
grow well in microgravity because they

43
00:01:41,938 --> 00:01:46,139
orient themselves toward light and so if

44
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:48,060
you have a light source that's suitable

45
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:49,439
for growing those plants they orient

46
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:51,570
themselves toward the light and they

47
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:53,099
grow similarly to what you'd expect them

48
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:56,188
to see on earth they're growing towards

49
00:01:53,099 --> 00:01:58,078
the light but interestingly enough roots

50
00:01:56,188 --> 00:02:00,449
are not in the light so if roots are in

51
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:03,839
the media they don't have any clue or

52
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:05,340
any environmental clue to grow down so

53
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,909
roots will grow up and out of the soil

54
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:11,189
because they are sensing gravity as and

55
00:02:08,909 --> 00:02:12,750
not light but at some point once they

56
00:02:11,189 --> 00:02:14,939
start to get air pruned as they

57
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:16,409
yes they would okay yeah so once they

58
00:02:14,939 --> 00:02:19,020
get out in the air and they're not in a

59
00:02:16,409 --> 00:02:21,270
media a liquid or a liquid or a wet type

60
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:24,030
of media anymore they would yeah they

61
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:26,840
would not be happy in this the journey

62
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:30,990
to let's say a planet like Mars and then

63
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:36,840
growing plants on Mars would it all be

64
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:41,010
under lights or with the Sun like is the

65
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:45,120
Sun to radiation heavy on Mars to be

66
00:02:41,009 --> 00:02:46,979
able to use that in addition to yeah so

67
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,569
like are we gonna have all LED lights on

68
00:02:46,979 --> 00:02:49,739
Mars and that's the only light source

69
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:51,449
these plants they're gonna have

70
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:54,480
everything I have sunlight as well so

71
00:02:51,449 --> 00:02:57,659
currently the the types of scenarios for

72
00:02:54,479 --> 00:03:00,439
being on Mars or the moon is to have a

73
00:02:57,659 --> 00:03:02,819
subterranean habitat and a subterranean

74
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:05,789
area to grow the plants and the reason

75
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:09,060
for that is the exposure to radiation we

76
00:03:05,789 --> 00:03:11,189
those we are lucky that we have an ozone

77
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:14,670
layer and an atmosphere that protects us

78
00:03:11,189 --> 00:03:16,439
from you know radiation from the Sun but

79
00:03:14,669 --> 00:03:19,169
if you're on the Moon or Mars you don't

80
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:21,120
have that protection anymore and so that

81
00:03:19,169 --> 00:03:24,030
that's a very hazardous environment both

82
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:27,569
for people and materials so if you have

83
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:28,949
a facility that is exposed to that type

84
00:03:27,569 --> 00:03:31,349
of radiation you can start to have

85
00:03:28,949 --> 00:03:33,149
material breakdown so the the current

86
00:03:31,349 --> 00:03:36,539
types of models are to be subterranean

87
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:39,510
and have solar collectors that provide

88
00:03:36,539 --> 00:03:41,969
the light and is and is then delivered

89
00:03:39,509 --> 00:03:44,609
into the plant growth area as well as

90
00:03:41,969 --> 00:03:46,409
the human habitat area and eliminating

91
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:49,140
those types are protecting from

92
00:03:46,409 --> 00:03:51,000
protecting the plants and the people

93
00:03:49,139 --> 00:03:52,589
from that type of radiation what do you

94
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,830
say solar collectors do you mean like

95
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:57,989
Solar tube type things that are taking

96
00:03:55,830 --> 00:04:00,390
the sunlight letting it come in but

97
00:03:57,989 --> 00:04:02,580
maybe having filters yes okay or

98
00:04:00,389 --> 00:04:05,548
variations of that so it could be it

99
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:07,890
could be solar tubes it could be solar

100
00:04:05,549 --> 00:04:10,080
light concentrators that have filters on

101
00:04:07,889 --> 00:04:12,719
them that remove the harmful radiation

102
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,430
in that in the radiation band that

103
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:16,680
they're receiving so that you're only

104
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:18,449
bringing in the wavelengths of light

105
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,040
that the plants need and you're

106
00:04:18,449 --> 00:04:21,930
eliminating the ones they don't so it'll

107
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:23,170
be a combination of filtered sunlight

108
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:25,120
and

109
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:28,800
Clemenza lighting yes because of the

110
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:30,879
well certain parts of the

111
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,980
extraterrestrial planets might not have

112
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:34,779
the same kind of photo periods that we

113
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:37,330
would experience on earth and so you

114
00:04:34,779 --> 00:04:38,829
would want to be able to provide the

115
00:04:37,329 --> 00:04:41,139
amount of light that the plants need to

116
00:04:38,829 --> 00:04:43,139
grow to support the humans that are

117
00:04:41,139 --> 00:04:45,639
going to be living in that environment

118
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:47,620
daily challenges you feel like you would

119
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:50,310
be going through as the guy responsible

120
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:52,090
for keeping the plants alive for the

121
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:53,860
population on Mars

122
00:04:52,089 --> 00:04:56,619
I really cannot come up with a good

123
00:04:53,860 --> 00:05:00,600
answer to that question we want to be

124
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:04,569
that yeah well your trip personally no

125
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:05,770
but but there but you're gonna have the

126
00:05:04,569 --> 00:05:07,629
same if you're on an if you're on

127
00:05:05,769 --> 00:05:09,909
another planet you're gonna have a lot

128
00:05:07,629 --> 00:05:11,500
of there's a lot of things that you have

129
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:13,900
in your favor that's similar to earth

130
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:17,350
like you have gravity again so you're

131
00:05:13,899 --> 00:05:19,179
able to have similar horticultural

132
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:21,430
protocols to growing plants that you're

133
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:23,620
using for example is your life-support

134
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:25,360
system that you'd have on earth but you

135
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:27,189
would also have to be very cognizant of

136
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,810
the various challenges environmental

137
00:05:27,189 --> 00:05:30,730
challenges that you have under those

138
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:34,360
conditions as well we mentioned

139
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:37,950
radiation before so that's that's one of

140
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:40,270
those challenges things like oxygen and

141
00:05:37,949 --> 00:05:42,879
creating sort of an environment for

142
00:05:40,269 --> 00:05:44,829
plants and people to live in well you

143
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:46,870
would you would have a you'd have a

144
00:05:44,829 --> 00:05:48,609
closed environment or semi closed

145
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:50,709
environment with which you would try to

146
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:52,990
retain as much of those life support

147
00:05:50,709 --> 00:05:54,909
components as possible the oxygen the

148
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:57,189
carbon dioxide in the water and the

149
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:58,390
carbon you wouldn't want to lose any of

150
00:05:57,189 --> 00:06:00,629
those things you would want to continue

151
00:05:58,389 --> 00:06:03,550
to recycle and reuse those along the way

152
00:06:00,629 --> 00:06:06,399
are those things things that could be

153
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:10,660
made by pulling out of the Mars

154
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:13,239
atmosphere like like is there maybe not

155
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:15,010
enough to breathe but is there excision

156
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,610
in the atmosphere that you can pull is

157
00:06:15,009 --> 00:06:18,730
there

158
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:21,009
hydrogen is there yet the atmosphere on

159
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:22,780
Mars is very thin and so it's not

160
00:06:21,009 --> 00:06:24,969
practical to think you could use that as

161
00:06:22,779 --> 00:06:28,109
a resource but it's not to say it's not

162
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:30,190
impossible there are other aspects of

163
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:33,790
extraterrestrial habitations that could

164
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:35,240
be useful for example there is lunar or

165
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:38,270
Marcille that could

166
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:39,650
be used to grow plants and there are

167
00:06:38,269 --> 00:06:42,168
there's research looking into using

168

174
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:57,310
plant testing to see if they're

175
