2
00:00:12,718 --> 00:00:17,589
so sweetie you guys while it's pulling

3
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:21,429
up I'll tell you this is Dodger

4
00:00:17,589 --> 00:00:24,429
he's a Labrador that works at our

5
00:00:21,429 --> 00:00:26,948
facility he's gentle thank you his job

6
00:00:24,429 --> 00:00:30,730
is to comfort the patients that are

7
00:00:26,949 --> 00:00:33,010
stuck there smoking weed all day so he's

8
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:35,920
got an important role with our clinical

9
00:00:33,009 --> 00:00:38,378
trials and excited he travels with me

10
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,239
everywhere so okay I think we got this

11
00:00:38,378 --> 00:00:43,388
it's just gonna take a minute to load

12
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:47,108
the pictures probably but let's see what

13
00:00:43,389 --> 00:00:48,728
we'll just jump right in so um as you

14
00:00:47,109 --> 00:00:51,728
guys know you know our studies are

15
00:00:48,728 --> 00:00:54,298
focused on flower so I know today you're

16
00:00:51,728 --> 00:00:56,399
gonna hear a lot about all the wonderful

17
00:00:54,298 --> 00:00:59,378
derivatives that are coming out of

18
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:03,039
cannabis flower but our studies try to

19
00:00:59,378 --> 00:01:07,569
focus on actual dry bud material so

20
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:09,670
we're doing FDA controlled trials trying

21
00:01:07,569 --> 00:01:12,938
to understand the medical benefits of

22
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:14,920
smoked and vaporize flour and our effort

23
00:01:12,938 --> 00:01:17,319
is to you know to really try to put

24
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:19,379
flour through the entire FDA drug

25
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:22,029
development process so we're doing

26
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:24,399
nonprofit drug development research and

27
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:25,929
it's really difficult to find partners

28
00:01:24,399 --> 00:01:27,759
that want to do this because you can

29
00:01:25,929 --> 00:01:29,670
imagine you know most these companies

30
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,599
are focused on trying to isolate

31
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:34,390
cannabinoids things that they can

32
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:35,949
actually patent and make money from and

33
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:39,759
we're the opposite you know we're trying

34
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:42,249
to basically keep flour in the nonprofit

35
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:44,920
realm because it can't be really

36
00:01:42,248 --> 00:01:47,259
patented easily and and we're doing that

37
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:49,030
because we believe that flour certainly

38
00:01:47,259 --> 00:01:52,030
is the least expensive because you don't

39
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:54,009
have to do all the processing after it's

40
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:55,810
still the most popular if you look at

41
00:01:54,009 --> 00:01:58,509
the data and all these legal states

42
00:01:55,810 --> 00:02:02,170
people still migrate toward natural

43
00:01:58,509 --> 00:02:04,629
flour and we think that it will also if

44
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:07,679
we can get flour through the FDA process

45
00:02:04,629 --> 00:02:10,568
I think it'll open most doors for other

46
00:02:07,679 --> 00:02:12,759
botanical medicines like you know I work

47
00:02:10,568 --> 00:02:13,969
with maps and many of you know there are

48
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:15,919
a nonprofit that

49
00:02:13,969 --> 00:02:18,740
spearheads all this psychedelic research

50
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:21,679
and so for us you know trying to pave

51
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:24,740
the way for other plant-based medicines

52
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:27,439
like psilocybin and ayahuasca and all

53
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:29,930
these important potential medicines so

54
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:34,400
and then of course the ultimate goal is

55
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:37,159
to try to to persuade health insurance

56
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,930
companies to pay for flour the same way

57
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:41,599
they pay for other pharmaceuticals and

58
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:44,090
that's why getting flour through the FDA

59
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:46,909
process is so essential in order to

60
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:49,069
achieve that goal of making insurance

61
00:02:46,909 --> 00:02:52,250
companies add that to their formularies

62
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:56,090
so um many of you know we're probably

63
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:57,830
best known for this clinical trial but

64
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:59,569
we do all sorts of different studies

65
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:01,610
which I'm going to talk about but but

66
00:02:59,569 --> 00:03:03,859
this study has been really crucial

67
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:05,420
because first thing it many of you

68
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:09,110
probably don't know we have not had a

69
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:11,389
new drug on the market for PTSD in

70
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:14,000
eighteen years can you believe that the

71
00:03:11,389 --> 00:03:17,569
first and only medicines that were

72
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:21,110
approved were zoloft and paxil back 18

73
00:03:17,569 --> 00:03:23,289
years ago so nothing else has emerged

74
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:27,620
and all these other drugs that we use

75
00:03:23,289 --> 00:03:29,659
physicians we we employ all these other

76
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:30,379
drugs off-label they've never been

77
00:03:29,659 --> 00:03:33,949
tested

78
00:03:30,379 --> 00:03:35,959
officially formally for PTSD but that's

79
00:03:33,949 --> 00:03:38,089
the challenge is when we're when you're

80
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:40,849
treating PTSD you're trying to attack

81
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:43,099
this whole constellation of symptoms

82
00:03:40,849 --> 00:03:45,169
right you they come in initially they

83
00:03:43,099 --> 00:03:47,569
might report some insomnia so you put

84
00:03:45,169 --> 00:03:49,759
them on some sleep meds then they report

85
00:03:47,569 --> 00:03:52,969
this depression anxiety you put them on

86
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:54,259
SSRI or other antidepressants and it you

87
00:03:52,969 --> 00:03:56,599
can see how these guys just keep

88
00:03:54,259 --> 00:03:58,819
snowballing and that's the way modern

89
00:03:56,599 --> 00:04:01,879
medicine is today we have a different

90
00:03:58,819 --> 00:04:03,979
prescription that that that attacks each

91
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:07,009
different target symptoms so these guys

92
00:04:03,979 --> 00:04:09,139
end up on you know sometimes 10 12

93
00:04:07,009 --> 00:04:12,530
different prescriptions all to treat

94
00:04:09,139 --> 00:04:15,189
PTSD and so that's why we became so

95
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:19,459
curious about the potential of cannabis

96
00:04:15,189 --> 00:04:21,829
the idea that this complex plant and the

97
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:24,918
pliat ropey that results from that right

98
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:27,019
that the opportunity to target multiple

99
00:04:24,918 --> 00:04:29,779
organ systems in the body with

100
00:04:27,019 --> 00:04:32,029
this one intervention is so exciting to

101
00:04:29,779 --> 00:04:34,339
us and that's why we embarked on this

102
00:04:32,029 --> 00:04:36,769
trial but I wanted you to be aware that

103
00:04:34,339 --> 00:04:39,469
this study even though we did finally

104
00:04:36,769 --> 00:04:42,529
complete it this year it took us 10

105
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:45,560
years to get to the finish line and that

106
00:04:42,529 --> 00:04:48,589
is the sad reality of trying to do

107
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:50,899
clinical trials in the US and if you

108
00:04:48,589 --> 00:04:53,478
dare say you want to study efficacy of

109
00:04:50,899 --> 00:04:55,098
cannabis how effective is cannabis of

110
00:04:53,478 --> 00:04:57,680
treating a certain illness like this

111
00:04:55,098 --> 00:05:00,709
those studies get in almost into a

112
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,930
permanent review process typically where

113
00:05:00,709 --> 00:05:05,329
they almost never emerge and the only

114
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:07,848
reason ours did was because we got so

115
00:05:05,329 --> 00:05:10,698
much media coverage along the way that

116
00:05:07,848 --> 00:05:12,348
pressured the government to help us you

117
00:05:10,699 --> 00:05:14,598
know kind of hurdle these obstacles and

118
00:05:12,348 --> 00:05:17,629
you can see oh you know we we ended up

119
00:05:14,598 --> 00:05:19,848
having this crazy saga which many of you

120
00:05:17,629 --> 00:05:21,860
we thank you so much for following us

121
00:05:19,848 --> 00:05:23,750
through this drama because it's insane

122
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:26,689
but you know we got fired from the

123
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:29,209
University where we actually had IRB

124
00:05:26,689 --> 00:05:31,399
approval from the University to do the

125
00:05:29,209 --> 00:05:34,698
study we were doing an FDA approved

126
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:38,120
fully funded study and they rejected us

127
00:05:34,699 --> 00:05:40,848
terminate us but this was a huge gift to

128
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:42,590
our study because it ultimately we ended

129
00:05:40,848 --> 00:05:45,228
up let me see if I can but yeah we ended

130
00:05:42,589 --> 00:05:48,528
up getting tons of media coverage and

131
00:05:45,228 --> 00:05:50,718
all these celebrities coming out of the

132
00:05:48,528 --> 00:05:53,269
woodwork to defend us like you know many

133
00:05:50,718 --> 00:05:56,089
of you know Andy while he was one of my

134
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:58,939
attendings at the University he's a he's

135
00:05:56,089 --> 00:06:00,859
a department chair of Integrative

136
00:05:58,939 --> 00:06:02,959
Medicine at the medical school at

137
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:05,778
University of Arizona and he wrote this

138
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:09,348
public letter condemning his own

139
00:06:05,778 --> 00:06:11,149
university president for for doing this

140
00:06:09,348 --> 00:06:14,000
and so we're really grateful to have

141
00:06:11,149 --> 00:06:16,129
folks like him and you know John Oliver

142
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,408
all these folks coming out trying to

143
00:06:16,129 --> 00:06:20,930
help us because they realize how what

144
00:06:18,408 --> 00:06:23,629
this was really an attack on scientific

145
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:26,718
freedom when they tried to suppress this

146
00:06:23,629 --> 00:06:28,879
work and so ultimately we ended up in

147
00:06:26,718 --> 00:06:30,740
our own private Institute and that's

148
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:33,939
what I wanted to point out to you guys

149
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:36,560
is that you can do this work totally

150
00:06:33,939 --> 00:06:39,810
independent from any university or

151
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:43,410
hospital we work through a private IRB

152
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:45,870
system we have no you know so then we're

153
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:48,419
not beholden to the politics the ugly

154
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:51,389
politics in the university it took me

155
00:06:48,418 --> 00:06:53,789
seven years though to get this what they

156
00:06:51,389 --> 00:06:56,610
call the you know the scientists call

157
00:06:53,790 --> 00:07:00,090
this the golden ticket because it allows

158
00:06:56,610 --> 00:07:03,270
you the privilege of purchasing cannabis

159
00:07:00,089 --> 00:07:05,269
from our federal government and so seven

160
00:07:03,269 --> 00:07:07,439
years it finally got the approval

161
00:07:05,269 --> 00:07:09,959
ordered you know move to order eight

162
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:13,259
kilos of cannabis which was required for

163
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:14,519
our study and suddenly I'm thinking you

164
00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:16,349
know surely this would come by like

165
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:19,109
armored truck or something but there's

166
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:22,470
the FedEx guy shows up at my door with

167
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:25,080
he has no idea he's even transporting

168
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:26,700
cannabis he's like why all these cameras

169
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:29,609
here I was like well this is really

170
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:31,639
historic day you know he waited so long

171
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:34,410
for this but I was you know so

172
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:36,418
disappointed to open up these this

173
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:38,880
cooler and see you know basically this

174
00:07:36,418 --> 00:07:41,250
was frozen cannabis sitting in the

175
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:44,279
lockers of the Research Triangle frozen

176
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:46,319
for years and you open up the sandwich

177
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:48,389
bags they have no information on them

178
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:51,899
they don't tell you anything except the

179
00:07:48,389 --> 00:07:53,849
CBD to THC ratio so normally when I do

180
00:07:51,899 --> 00:07:56,069
clinical trials I always get a drug

181
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:58,950
master file that tells you all the

182
00:07:56,069 --> 00:08:01,439
properties of the study drug no not

183
00:07:58,949 --> 00:08:03,659
there's zero transparency on that you do

184
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:06,449
not get access to the drug master file

185
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:09,030
despite us suing before sending FOIA

186
00:08:06,449 --> 00:08:11,550
requests all of that so this is also

187
00:08:09,029 --> 00:08:13,769
another thing that handcuffed scientists

188
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:15,720
because we have no idea what's really in

189
00:08:13,769 --> 00:08:18,839
it and we also we have our own

190
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:21,210
analytical s a DEA license to do the

191
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:23,429
analysis but we decided we wanted to

192
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:26,038
send it out to an independent lab so

193
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:28,379
nobody would fault us for this and you

194
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:31,889
can see this is the material this is

195
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:34,168
pictures on the top from years ago right

196
00:08:31,889 --> 00:08:36,299
many of you know Ethan Rousseau sent me

197
00:08:34,168 --> 00:08:39,329
these pictures of his study drug when

198
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:41,809
you can see how depressing this is that

199
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:45,620
this is the materials basically a

200
00:08:41,809 --> 00:08:49,139
concoction of stems thick seeds leaves

201
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:50,240
and some flowering you know flowering

202
00:08:49,139 --> 00:08:52,610
tops

203
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,438
this is the most recent batch that we

204
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:56,539
got on the bottom so you can see what

205
00:08:54,438 --> 00:08:58,759
happened was we started criticizing the

206
00:08:56,539 --> 00:09:01,009
government about this you know all this

207
00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:02,869
extraneous plant material weighing down

208
00:09:01,009 --> 00:09:05,659
because remember when in clinical trials

209
00:09:02,869 --> 00:09:08,178
you issue study drug to patients by

210
00:09:05,659 --> 00:09:10,368
weight right so they may get 2 grams a

211
00:09:08,178 --> 00:09:12,438
day 3 grams a day but if half of the

212
00:09:10,369 --> 00:09:15,019
weight of the study drug is all of this

213
00:09:12,438 --> 00:09:16,338
junk and not the actual flowering part

214
00:09:15,019 --> 00:09:19,009
of the plant then you see how that

215
00:09:16,339 --> 00:09:21,019
already sabotages your study from the

216
00:09:19,009 --> 00:09:23,539
beginning so after all this criticism

217
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:25,159
they didn't like scientists criticizing

218
00:09:23,539 --> 00:09:27,708
their study drug and they said alright

219
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:29,899
we're gonna grind it into a powder so

220
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:33,799
now you can't even discern what's in it

221
00:09:29,899 --> 00:09:35,360
very clever of our government but we

222
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:37,698
still know you can still see all the

223
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:40,009
fragments in there that show this is no

224
00:09:37,698 --> 00:09:43,878
better than you know Mexican ditch weed

225
00:09:40,009 --> 00:09:46,789
really but you can see when we sent this

226
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:49,579
out to these independent labs we ended

227
00:09:46,789 --> 00:09:53,629
up finding excessively high levels of

228
00:09:49,578 --> 00:09:56,628
mold in all the batches and we went to

229
00:09:53,629 --> 00:09:58,278
back to NIDA and and university

230
00:09:56,629 --> 00:10:00,379
Mississippian said you know what was

231
00:09:58,278 --> 00:10:03,019
your mold testing ours was over a

232
00:10:00,379 --> 00:10:05,089
hundred thousand CFU of mold in all the

233
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:07,759
batches and they said oh we've never

234
00:10:05,089 --> 00:10:10,399
tested for mold and so I was like wow

235
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:12,110
this is really you know mystifying that

236
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:14,808
they've never thought I mean they're

237
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:16,850
growing outdoors in Mississippi it's

238
00:10:14,808 --> 00:10:19,999
like a formula well the humidity there

239
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:22,040
it's a formula from get growing mold but

240
00:10:19,999 --> 00:10:24,019
they never tested for it and and only

241
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:26,178
when we brought this to light we shared

242
00:10:24,019 --> 00:10:28,879
the hour summary report you know we

243
00:10:26,178 --> 00:10:31,249
ended up doing three different rounds of

244
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:34,519
independent testing all showing sky high

245
00:10:31,249 --> 00:10:37,610
levels of mold and sadly this is the

246
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:40,970
only federally legal supply so think

247
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:44,749
about that that every single study done

248
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:47,629
in the US that was looking at flower has

249
00:10:44,749 --> 00:10:49,548
been forced to use this lousy study drug

250
00:10:47,629 --> 00:10:51,649
and I want to just give you some good

251
00:10:49,548 --> 00:10:54,889
news though is that so after ten years

252
00:10:51,649 --> 00:10:58,009
we finally got the seventy this is the

253
00:10:54,889 --> 00:11:00,798
80th veteran through the clinical trial

254
00:10:58,009 --> 00:11:03,060
right so we screened almost 6,000

255
00:11:00,798 --> 00:11:05,279
veterans for the study

256
00:11:03,059 --> 00:11:06,809
finally found that eighty that met all

257
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:08,759
the correct you can see there's just

258
00:11:06,809 --> 00:11:11,579
pages and pages of inclusion and

259
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:13,950
exclusion criteria but that's the binder

260
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:16,020
for the 80th patient we had only four

261
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:18,930
dropouts in the study which is a real

262
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:20,759
testament to the you know resilience of

263
00:11:18,929 --> 00:11:22,259
these veterans they just were so

264
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:25,259
determined they would never resign

265
00:11:22,259 --> 00:11:27,480
unless we forced them to and we did have

266
00:11:25,259 --> 00:11:29,429
a couple patients that had some adverse

267
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:32,399
events but this is interesting too that

268
00:11:29,429 --> 00:11:35,609
the FDA still requires you know the

269
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:38,399
binders like a thousand pages and still

270
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:40,350
we have to do everything on paper spend

271
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:42,230
hours and hours transferring this to an

272
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:45,269
electronic databases so you see how

273
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:50,550
laborious these trials are but

274
00:11:45,269 --> 00:11:53,429
ultimately our I'll just on sadly I

275
00:11:50,549 --> 00:11:55,409
can't share the results of the veterans

276
00:11:53,429 --> 00:11:57,689
study yet because we haven't published

277
00:11:55,409 --> 00:12:00,569
all the data we have unblinded

278
00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:02,670
everything and we're putting we're

279
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:05,100
pulling this into a manuscript now that

280
00:12:02,669 --> 00:12:09,599
hopefully will be submitted to jam later

281
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:11,460
this year but I can tell you that the

282
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:15,029
results are exactly what you would

283
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:20,639
expect from smoking moldy diluted

284
00:12:15,029 --> 00:12:22,649
cannabis it's it's I'm sad to say that

285
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:26,850
I'm not sure people are gonna be eager

286
00:12:22,649 --> 00:12:28,799
to read these results so um so you'll

287
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:32,610
see later but I think that this is what

288
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:34,829
spurred on I we've been trying to find a

289
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:38,039
law firm to help us sue the DEA for

290
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:39,570
years over this monopoly and for those

291
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:41,909
of you who aren't aware you know

292
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:45,240
University of Mississippi has enjoyed a

293
00:12:41,909 --> 00:12:49,500
government enforced monopoly for now you

294
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:52,049
know since 1968 so that's 50 years that

295
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:55,230
they have had the only scheduled one

296
00:12:52,049 --> 00:12:57,449
license as a bulk manufacturer so every

297
00:12:55,230 --> 00:13:00,720
clinical trial that we or any scientist

298
00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:03,540
do you're all the universities at in

299
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,910
California here CMC are UCSD all these

300
00:13:03,539 --> 00:13:07,889
groups have been forced to buy this

301
00:13:05,909 --> 00:13:09,360
substandard plant material even though

302
00:13:07,889 --> 00:13:11,939
you're surrounded by some of the most

303
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:16,089
beautiful flower in the world you're

304
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:19,300
buying that powder that green powder

305
00:13:16,089 --> 00:13:21,279
and so it makes me concerned you know

306
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:23,289
Pierre just mentioned the National

307
00:13:21,278 --> 00:13:25,568
Academy of Science report and we all

308
00:13:23,289 --> 00:13:28,269
know that that report only showed

309
00:13:25,568 --> 00:13:30,068
efficacy you know really it said that

310
00:13:28,269 --> 00:13:32,948
there was only strong evidence to

311
00:13:30,068 --> 00:13:37,299
support cannabis for pain nausea and

312
00:13:32,948 --> 00:13:38,938
vomiting and and spasticity of MS but

313
00:13:37,299 --> 00:13:41,528
you think about all these other

314
00:13:38,938 --> 00:13:43,419
conditions that patients are reporting

315
00:13:41,528 --> 00:13:45,338
they're getting benefit from you know

316
00:13:43,419 --> 00:13:48,308
everything from epilepsy to inflammatory

317
00:13:45,339 --> 00:13:50,649
bowel disease those study there was not

318
00:13:48,308 --> 00:13:52,808
scientific evidence to support their use

319
00:13:50,649 --> 00:13:56,169
and that doesn't surprise any of us

320
00:13:52,808 --> 00:13:58,419
right because we see what the how these

321
00:13:56,169 --> 00:14:01,808
studies have been undermined by the look

322
00:13:58,419 --> 00:14:04,178
this low quality study drug we see how

323
00:14:01,808 --> 00:14:06,669
studies have been subverted by you know

324
00:14:04,178 --> 00:14:09,009
being forced into fixed dosing that was

325
00:14:06,669 --> 00:14:10,928
one of the things I was most proud of in

326
00:14:09,009 --> 00:14:13,300
this trial that we just finished this

327
00:14:10,928 --> 00:14:14,198
veterans study was the first one I'm

328
00:14:13,299 --> 00:14:17,859
aware of that

329
00:14:14,198 --> 00:14:20,649
oh the FDA allowed us to do patient self

330
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:23,528
titration right so these PTSD patients

331
00:14:20,649 --> 00:14:25,958
need to be able to adjust their own dose

332
00:14:23,528 --> 00:14:28,149
you can't force them into taking you

333
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:30,248
know 20 milligrams twice a day whether

334
00:14:28,149 --> 00:14:32,919
they need it or not that would be absurd

335
00:14:30,249 --> 00:14:34,659
and that would that's what happens with

336
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:36,938
these previous clinical trials we've

337
00:14:34,659 --> 00:14:39,338
forced people and many times take way

338
00:14:36,938 --> 00:14:41,798
more than they need then they get tons

339
00:14:39,339 --> 00:14:44,439
of side effects that you know kind of

340
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:46,328
eclipsed any therapeutic benefit that

341
00:14:44,438 --> 00:14:47,769
we're able to document so that's where I

342
00:14:46,328 --> 00:14:50,198
think these studies have gone wrong

343
00:14:47,769 --> 00:14:52,119
hopefully all the clinical trials going

344
00:14:50,198 --> 00:14:54,159
forward if any of you out there are

345
00:14:52,119 --> 00:14:56,889
thinking about doing clinical trials I

346
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:59,948
would really urge you to keep on this

347
00:14:56,889 --> 00:15:03,869
train of patient self titration demand

348
00:14:59,948 --> 00:15:06,308
that your FDA you know the FDA was very

349
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:08,860
oppositional with this idea initially it

350
00:15:06,308 --> 00:15:11,289
took us months of back-and-forth with

351
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:13,240
them before they finally embraced it

352
00:15:11,289 --> 00:15:15,458
but believe me their paradigm is

353
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:17,740
established by Big Pharma right so

354
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:20,558
that's what they know is fixed dosing

355
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:25,360
models so we have to push them to to

356
00:15:20,558 --> 00:15:27,668
rethink that paradigm and let us look at

357
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,720
botanical medicine with a different

358
00:15:27,668 --> 00:15:30,939
paradigm

359
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:33,160
that patient self titration should be

360
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:34,960
the rule of the day and we've had you

361
00:15:33,159 --> 00:15:37,240
know many of the veterans in the study

362
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:40,360
didn't even you know they did some days

363
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:42,519
they you know how the PTSD fluctuates

364
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:44,440
right some days you are good some days

365
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:46,389
are bad some days they don't need any

366
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:48,880
medicine other days they know oh I'm

367
00:15:46,389 --> 00:15:51,939
going to Walmart I got a pre Medicaid I

368
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:53,559
know this is gonna be brutal so so

369
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:56,320
that's the idea is we want to give

370
00:15:53,559 --> 00:15:58,659
patients the power to decide when they

371
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,860
want to medicate how much they need some

372
00:15:58,659 --> 00:16:02,230
of these patients you know they were

373
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:04,930
required to bring back their unused

374
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:07,180
cannabis each week so I would weigh what

375
00:16:04,929 --> 00:16:08,889
they used each day and I could see that

376
00:16:07,179 --> 00:16:11,889
a lot of these patients only needed a

377
00:16:08,889 --> 00:16:14,649
few inhalations at night to help them

378
00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:16,449
initiate sleep stay asleep all night

379
00:16:14,649 --> 00:16:18,730
suppress their nightmares and flashbacks

380
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:21,730
they'd wake up in the morning feeling

381
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:24,879
refreshed they didn't even need often

382
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:26,769
any study drug in the daytime it was you

383
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:28,840
know the the nighttime dose was adequate

384
00:16:26,769 --> 00:16:32,559
so that's the whole point is give them

385
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:34,629
the power to adjust the dose so now I'm

386
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:37,629
gonna leave I know we're probably sure

387
00:16:34,629 --> 00:16:39,850
Domo I'm okay good okay so um I want to

388
00:16:37,629 --> 00:16:43,659
just explain to you what our next steps

389
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:46,899
are because of the results of this

390
00:16:43,659 --> 00:16:50,289
veterans study it it spurred us on even

391
00:16:46,899 --> 00:16:52,769
further to demand a change from the DEA

392
00:16:50,289 --> 00:16:55,929
and what many of you probably read in

393
00:16:52,769 --> 00:16:58,120
2016 the DEA announced that they were

394
00:16:55,929 --> 00:17:00,370
going to finally end the monopoly and

395
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:02,679
license other growers for Research's was

396
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:06,578
on the federal register so it was a

397
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:08,438
legit announcement but since that then

398
00:17:06,578 --> 00:17:11,948
three years later they have not moved

399
00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:13,740
forward one inch toward doing this we

400
00:17:11,949 --> 00:17:16,568
they have you know 30 applications

401
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:18,939
sitting on the desk of the DEA for three

402
00:17:16,568 --> 00:17:22,420
years that have not been processed they

403
00:17:18,939 --> 00:17:24,579
took our application fee $3,000 they

404
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:28,300
processed my credit card but not my

405
00:17:24,578 --> 00:17:31,809
application so so that's why we were so

406
00:17:28,299 --> 00:17:33,759
lucky to find this law firm that has no

407
00:17:31,809 --> 00:17:36,579
relationship to cannabis by the way

408
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:38,679
they're people that just heard me speak

409
00:17:36,579 --> 00:17:40,569
at South by Southwest and they were so

410
00:17:38,679 --> 00:17:42,340
outraged by this

411
00:17:40,569 --> 00:17:43,990
oppression of scientific freedom and

412
00:17:42,339 --> 00:17:46,418
they said you know what we'll take this

413
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:50,169
pro bono they spent months researching

414
00:17:46,419 --> 00:17:52,778
this and submitted the petition so and

415
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:55,120
it's actually not just against the DEA

416
00:17:52,778 --> 00:17:57,579
but we're also targeting the Attorney

417
00:17:55,119 --> 00:18:01,258
General whose office seems to be the

418
00:17:57,579 --> 00:18:04,599
primary culprit here supposedly the DEA

419
00:18:01,259 --> 00:18:07,690
wanted to move forward but the you know

420
00:18:04,599 --> 00:18:09,908
DOJ and attorney general said no you're

421
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:13,200
not to process those so this is

422
00:18:09,909 --> 00:18:16,059
essential that this this DEA monopoly is

423
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:18,970
really the final barrier to doing

424
00:18:16,058 --> 00:18:21,428
legitimate cannabis clinical trials in

425
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:23,919
the US and it's held us back so much

426
00:18:21,429 --> 00:18:26,919
because you can see the menu here is so

427
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:30,549
limited in our study we basically got to

428
00:18:26,919 --> 00:18:34,750
look at high THC batch a batch of high

429
00:18:30,548 --> 00:18:38,710
CBD flour a batch of one to one THC the

430
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:42,490
CBD and placebo and that's it so that's

431
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:44,259
the menu you've got and and yet here in

432
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:46,929
the real world patients obviously have

433
00:18:44,259 --> 00:18:49,179
access to thousands of phenotypes we

434
00:18:46,929 --> 00:18:51,788
have a mountain of anecdotal evidence

435
00:18:49,179 --> 00:18:53,940
from patients that this is helping them

436
00:18:51,788 --> 00:18:56,288
but that's the promise this is not

437
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:59,169
barring out in these clinical trials

438
00:18:56,288 --> 00:19:01,269
because of the you know the the

439
00:18:59,169 --> 00:19:03,788
disappointing study drug and the fixed

440
00:19:01,269 --> 00:19:06,419
dosing model is really harming the

441
00:19:03,788 --> 00:19:09,339
outcomes of these studies so it's a real

442
00:19:06,419 --> 00:19:11,710
conundrum it's like this catch-22 right

443
00:19:09,339 --> 00:19:14,918
because here we're trying to reform

444
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:17,139
public policy we need data in order to

445
00:19:14,919 --> 00:19:19,179
do that yes there are thousands of

446
00:19:17,138 --> 00:19:21,869
controlled trials that have already been

447
00:19:19,179 --> 00:19:25,360
published in peer-reviewed journals

448
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:27,278
alluding to the efficacy of cannabis for

449
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:30,819
certain illnesses but certainly not

450
00:19:27,278 --> 00:19:33,220
close to enough to persuade the medical

451
00:19:30,819 --> 00:19:35,408
community or health departments they're

452
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:37,960
all we're all so snobbish about you know

453
00:19:35,409 --> 00:19:40,059
we need randomized controlled trials

454
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:41,528
that is the gold standard and you know

455
00:19:40,058 --> 00:19:43,808
anything short of that is good and

456
00:19:41,528 --> 00:19:46,628
that's the challenge with PTSD right is

457
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:48,548
that PTSD all the data so far has been

458
00:19:46,628 --> 00:19:50,079
conflicting we have a ton of

459
00:19:48,548 --> 00:19:53,629
observational studies

460
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:55,609
some have showed cannabis benefits PTSD

461
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:58,310
have shown it's harmful that it makes

462
00:19:55,609 --> 00:20:00,409
patients aggressive it promotes cannabis

463
00:19:58,309 --> 00:20:03,740
dependence so there's all these reasons

464
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:06,350
why people were hanging on this trial

465
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:08,660
hoping that this data would you know

466
00:20:06,349 --> 00:20:10,519
finally the first randomized controlled

467
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:11,930
trial in the world looking at this

468
00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:15,980
thought finally we'd have a definitive

469
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:17,750
answer and so this is the challenge for

470
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:20,059
all of you who are who are in this

471
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:21,920
movement to try to keep the pressure on

472
00:20:20,059 --> 00:20:25,429
the DEA the DEA has already received

473
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:27,860
over a dozen letters bipartisan letters

474
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:30,529
from Congress and they have not even

475
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:33,500
felt the need to respond it's amazing

476
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:35,029
that the DEA feels you know I apparently

477
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:37,430
they're not accountable to anybody

478
00:20:35,029 --> 00:20:39,289
because they don't even respond to two

479
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:41,240
letters from Congress not even a form

480
00:20:39,289 --> 00:20:43,309
letter so I was pretty amazed by that

481
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:45,049
and that's why we move forward with the

482
00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:48,349
litigation because we realized we can't

483
00:20:45,049 --> 00:20:51,109
wait on them to to act you know we've

484
00:20:48,349 --> 00:20:53,689
heard references from the new attorney

485
00:20:51,109 --> 00:20:56,359
general bar saying oh we're gonna get on

486
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:58,640
that now we're gonna do something but we

487
00:20:56,359 --> 00:21:01,729
all know that all these bills are just

488
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:03,350
stagnating waiting for you know I don't

489
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:05,240
know what they're waiting for I feel

490
00:21:03,349 --> 00:21:07,250
like nobody's interested in solving the

491
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:09,650
problem so hopefully we'll find a

492
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:11,750
sympathetic judge but in the meantime I

493
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:15,200
wanted to point out this is actually a

494
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:18,019
two-front war were we're creating here

495
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:20,660
the one front is this litigation against

496
00:21:18,019 --> 00:21:24,170
the DEA the second front is this

497
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:26,540
opportunity which is importing cannabis

498
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:29,420
from a foreign country so our government

499
00:21:26,539 --> 00:21:31,549
seems to have no problem with us

500
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:33,710
scientists sourcing cannabis from other

501
00:21:31,549 --> 00:21:37,159
countries they just don't want any other

502
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:40,130
domestic manufacturers so here's what

503
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:43,279
we're doing is the if we can bring in

504
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:46,910
flour from Canada as soon as the

505
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:50,000
Canadian lp's prove that they have GMP

506
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:52,940
grade flour then I will be a I will have

507
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,859
the green light to to import their flour

508
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:57,289
and that will finally break this

509
00:21:54,859 --> 00:21:59,959
monopoly because you'll notice many of

510
00:21:57,289 --> 00:22:01,670
you have read how UCSD is importing

511
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:04,730
flour of sorry they're importing

512
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:06,800
cannabis oil from tilray for that tremor

513
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:09,829
study that just

514
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:11,809
be aware that that oil cannabis oil

515
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:14,029
there's no monopolies around cannabis

516
00:22:11,809 --> 00:22:17,119
oil that was broken years ago member but

517
00:22:14,029 --> 00:22:19,759
when GW was allowed to bring in Sativex

518
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:22,189
force for clinical trials so that

519
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:24,529
monopoly ended years ago the monopoly

520
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:27,110
that exists is just around flower right

521
00:22:24,529 --> 00:22:29,029
now they have not allowed any flower to

522
00:22:27,109 --> 00:22:31,279
enter the u.s. externally they're not

523
00:22:29,029 --> 00:22:34,009
allowing any other domestic growers so

524
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:35,960
this is our hope is this trial was

525
00:22:34,009 --> 00:22:38,029
supposed to be I wanted to just point

526
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:41,480
out something interesting here so we're

527
00:22:38,029 --> 00:22:43,940
looking at late stage cancer patients

528
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:46,430
right and we're going to evaluate this

529
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:48,980
is one looking at quality of life the

530
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:51,170
second study we're doing is looking at

531
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:53,319
breakthrough pain so we're gonna be

532
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:56,090
evaluating smoked cannabis flower

533
00:22:53,319 --> 00:22:58,399
compared to fentanyl right because

534
00:22:56,089 --> 00:23:00,859
fentanyl like the nuclear bomb of

535
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:04,340
opioids we use it so reflexively with

536
00:23:00,859 --> 00:23:07,309
our cancer patients but the fact is that

537
00:23:04,339 --> 00:23:09,470
in a pilot study we did in Montreal we

538
00:23:07,309 --> 00:23:11,690
found that Canton smoked flower

539
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:14,000
performed way better than fentanyl and

540
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:15,920
just came on so quickly and patients got

541
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,799
relieved so we're we're going to do the

542
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:21,259
Strout we have FDA approval the issue

543
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:24,440
now is that the flower that I was

544
00:23:21,259 --> 00:23:27,980
preparing to import from this LP in

545
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:31,490
Canada suddenly found the presence of

546
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:33,500
three mycotoxins so this is something I

547
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:36,920
want to point out is even these giant

548
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:40,670
this is a giant LP multi-billion dollars

549
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:42,800
they have the financial resources to do

550
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:45,050
the best industrial agriculture in the

551
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:46,819
world and yet they're not paying

552
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:49,339
attention to the quality of their

553
00:23:46,819 --> 00:23:51,319
medicine and so this study that was

554
00:23:49,339 --> 00:23:52,849
supposed to start in January and here we

555
00:23:51,319 --> 00:23:55,039
are they still haven't been able to

556
00:23:52,849 --> 00:23:57,319
remediate the flower so I just want to

557
00:23:55,039 --> 00:24:00,379
mention that this is the frustration for

558
00:23:57,319 --> 00:24:01,909
us scientists we are highly dependent on

559
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:04,490
these groups because we don't want a

560
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:07,490
non-profit we don't have money to pay

561
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:08,960
for these studies so we have to wait for

562
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:10,849
them to do this but I just want to say

563
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:13,100
that you know some of these corporate

564
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:16,099
behemoths are just so focused on the

565
00:24:13,099 --> 00:24:18,259
money play and they forgot about the

566
00:24:16,099 --> 00:24:20,219
quality of the medicine and taking care

567
00:24:18,259 --> 00:24:22,500
of sick people and it just makes me sad

568
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:24,329
that were in this state now where we're

569
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:27,839
you know we're so dependent on this but

570
00:24:24,329 --> 00:24:29,699
so I want to bring that up and then my

571
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:31,829
final slide I just want to mention there

572
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:33,808
are all kinds of interesting things that

573
00:24:31,829 --> 00:24:35,220
come out that are generated through

574
00:24:33,808 --> 00:24:39,000
these trials even though we weren't

575
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:40,558
studying you know opioid substitution in

576
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,769
our study and we weren't studying

577
00:24:40,558 --> 00:24:46,048
erectile function but the veterans were

578
00:24:43,769 --> 00:24:47,788
reporting to us that both of those

579
00:24:46,048 --> 00:24:49,528
things were happening during the three

580
00:24:47,788 --> 00:24:52,200
months and keep in mind this is even

581
00:24:49,528 --> 00:24:54,869
with this with this really substandard

582
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:56,669
plant material that they were noticing

583
00:24:54,869 --> 00:24:59,038
that they weren't as relying on their

584
00:24:56,669 --> 00:25:01,500
opioids many of them reported completely

585
00:24:59,038 --> 00:25:04,378
weaning off opioids during the course of

586
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:06,329
this three months study so that was

587
00:25:04,378 --> 00:25:07,859
exciting phenomena and then this was the

588
00:25:06,329 --> 00:25:11,099
other thing that we had so many young

589
00:25:07,859 --> 00:25:13,168
veterans coming in on viagra because

590
00:25:11,099 --> 00:25:15,028
that was you know that's what the VA

591
00:25:13,169 --> 00:25:17,580
does they pummel you with all these

592
00:25:15,028 --> 00:25:19,710
psych meds that cause you to have no

593
00:25:17,579 --> 00:25:22,439
erectile function and then they throw in

594
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:24,269
some viagra for a good measure and so

595
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:26,850
it's you can imagine how demoralizing

596
00:25:24,269 --> 00:25:29,419
for two year old veterans already on

597
00:25:26,849 --> 00:25:32,878
viagra they think their life is over and

598
00:25:29,419 --> 00:25:35,009
and so this was an exciting discovered

599
00:25:32,878 --> 00:25:36,928
to that many of the vets were noticing

600
00:25:35,009 --> 00:25:38,490
that they no longer needed the viagra

601
00:25:36,929 --> 00:25:41,970
during the time where they were using

602
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:44,759
the smoked flower so I think that was my

603
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:46,710
final slide we're hoping to do a trial

604
00:25:44,759 --> 00:25:48,919
on this subject as well and we're

605
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:53,548
looking for partners we have some

606
00:25:48,919 --> 00:25:55,200
interest from a canadian LPS and if

607
00:25:53,548 --> 00:25:58,378
you've heard of zen abyss is one of the

608
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:01,288
LPS up there that is that is headed up

609
00:25:58,378 --> 00:26:03,839
by a urologist who's already agreed to

610
00:26:01,288 --> 00:26:05,099
fund this trial so we're hoping but the

611
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:06,839
good thing about them what I was

612
00:26:05,099 --> 00:26:08,490
impressed buying Canada Pier can

613
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:11,178
probably touch on the is it they're

614
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:13,169
willing there's like a collaborative

615
00:26:11,179 --> 00:26:15,690
competitiveness we're certainly all the

616
00:26:13,169 --> 00:26:17,970
LPS are fighting you know to dominate

617
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:20,370
but they're also willing like Zen abyss

618
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:22,169
was willing to allow us to source flour

619
00:26:20,369 --> 00:26:24,119
from all the different LPS because all

620
00:26:22,169 --> 00:26:26,220
of them have different varieties that

621
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:28,018
could be valuable and they get that and

622
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:30,569
so they're willing to fund the study and

623
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:32,700
not necessarily insist that their flour

624
00:26:30,569 --> 00:26:33,589
has to be the only one so I was really

625
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:35,179
impressed

626
00:26:33,589 --> 00:26:37,399
by that and I'm hoping someday in the

627
00:26:35,179 --> 00:26:40,250
u.s. we can achieve that kind of

628
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:42,230
collaborative spirit so now I know we're

629
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:43,940
short and I know we I don't know if we

630
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:46,220
do we still have time Oh question do you

631
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:52,850
think so oh good all right all right

632
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:55,100
let's see if anybody got a question two

633
00:26:52,849 --> 00:26:57,349
points a lovely talk thank you very much

634
00:26:55,099 --> 00:26:59,480
number one regarding this here's one of

635
00:26:57,349 --> 00:27:02,449
the issues right it may well be the

636
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:04,819
cannabis it may be a toxin that's doing

637
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:07,399
this right you just don't know hence the

638
00:27:04,819 --> 00:27:10,339
need for control better control things

639
00:27:07,398 --> 00:27:12,168
and if you'll allow me one anecdote so

640
00:27:10,339 --> 00:27:13,548
you said about having to give fixed dose

641
00:27:12,169 --> 00:27:15,980
you're absolutely right and what I've

642
00:27:13,548 --> 00:27:18,769
been doing of course is titrating up and

643
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:21,019
I stop when there's some sort of adverse

644
00:27:18,769 --> 00:27:22,609
effect but in one of my patients with

645
00:27:21,019 --> 00:27:24,470
Parkinson's disease who had

646
00:27:22,609 --> 00:27:26,839
osteoarthritis of the hip which is the

647
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:30,230
hip I was treating we went up to about

648
00:27:26,839 --> 00:27:32,209
one ml of oil twice a day and said

649
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:33,649
frankly doc it's not working my pain is

650
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:35,990
the same we said well okay well we'll

651
00:27:33,648 --> 00:27:39,889
just titrate down I got back down to 0.7

652
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:42,470
twice a day and said stop stop because

653
00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:44,630
you know what my tremors are coming back

654
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:46,548
now that you're titrating down go back

655
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:49,278
up because I feel so much better on it

656
00:27:46,548 --> 00:27:52,009
so so we have to keep you know that that

657
00:27:49,278 --> 00:27:54,619
spirit open of openness and looking for

658
00:27:52,009 --> 00:27:57,710
for things and to your point titrating

659
00:27:54,619 --> 00:27:59,119
is so important when using and I think

660
00:27:57,710 --> 00:28:01,970
that's what people are discovering is

661
00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:04,339
that they need often a lot less cannabis

662
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:05,899
than they thought even though typically

663
00:28:04,339 --> 00:28:07,908
in these studies we're giving them two

664
00:28:05,898 --> 00:28:11,058
or three grams a day just to give them

665
00:28:07,909 --> 00:28:12,620
enough to use what they need but most of

666
00:28:11,058 --> 00:28:14,869
the time these patients are reporting

667
00:28:12,619 --> 00:28:17,599
needing less than a half gram a day and

668
00:28:14,869 --> 00:28:19,398
and that just goes against that attitude

669
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:21,288
from the prohibitionists that oh if you

670
00:28:19,398 --> 00:28:23,569
give them you know too much that their

671
00:28:21,288 --> 00:28:25,879
gel just abuse it the fact is you know

672
00:28:23,569 --> 00:28:27,500
sick patients just want to feel

673
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:29,929
functional they're not trying to get

674
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:31,819
stoned and I think we can you know these

675
00:28:29,929 --> 00:28:34,759
studies hopefully will dispel a lot of

676
00:28:31,819 --> 00:28:36,678
these myths yeah well thank you so much

677
00:28:34,759 --> 00:28:38,950
for the talk this was wonderful

678
00:28:36,679 --> 00:28:41,028
I'm wondering why you all are

679
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:44,360
investigating smoking as well as

680
00:28:41,028 --> 00:28:46,130
vaporization besides maybe just cost and

681
00:28:44,359 --> 00:28:46,669
like familiarity is there any reason

682
00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:48,290
that

683
00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:50,390
you are looking at both ends of this

684
00:28:48,289 --> 00:28:53,928
it's such a good question I am actually

685
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:56,059
really frustrated by you know this

686
00:28:53,929 --> 00:28:58,220
veteran study was actually supposed to

687
00:28:56,058 --> 00:29:01,428
randomize people into a smoking arm or

688
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:02,690
vaporizing arm but we decided we had an

689
00:29:01,429 --> 00:29:05,750
agreement from tilray

690
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:08,090
to do our vaporizer arm of the study and

691
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:10,308
that they would fully fund it that was

692
00:29:08,089 --> 00:29:12,409
six years ago they still haven't

693
00:29:10,308 --> 00:29:14,480
finished the trial they have like I

694
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:17,029
don't know two or four patients and

695
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:19,370
rolls and it's just been a really anemic

696
00:29:17,029 --> 00:29:21,019
effort and I'm really depressed about

697
00:29:19,369 --> 00:29:22,969
because we would now be able to have

698
00:29:21,019 --> 00:29:24,829
data from both if they had finished but

699
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:26,539
again this shows you they're happy to

700
00:29:24,829 --> 00:29:28,399
waive the trial in front of their

701
00:29:26,539 --> 00:29:30,259
investors and brag about how they're

702
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:32,269
doing all this important research but

703
00:29:30,259 --> 00:29:34,308
the fact is when it comes to they had a

704
00:29:32,269 --> 00:29:36,048
chance to be involved in this it really

705
00:29:34,308 --> 00:29:37,940
meant Android can speak to this because

706
00:29:36,048 --> 00:29:40,970
she knows how tough it is these big

707
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:43,460
corporations are so dependent on

708
00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:45,890
shareholder satisfaction and it's really

709
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:48,169
hard and they're constantly you know

710
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:49,429
holding this up and waving it around it

711
00:29:48,169 --> 00:29:51,259
but then when it comes to really

712
00:29:49,429 --> 00:29:52,700
executing they don't do it but I agree

713
00:29:51,259 --> 00:29:54,529
with you the one thing that we heard

714
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:56,660
from veterans was and many of you in the

715
00:29:54,529 --> 00:29:58,940
audience can probably speak to this and

716
00:29:56,660 --> 00:30:00,350
if you have time after please come talk

717
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:03,590
to me because I keep hearing from people

718
00:30:00,349 --> 00:30:05,750
that they insist that smoking is just so

719
00:30:03,589 --> 00:30:07,909
much more robust time you know -

720
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:10,548
typically I'm very anti smoking in my

721
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:12,380
internal medicine practice I it's what's

722
00:30:10,548 --> 00:30:14,960
really hard for me to embrace this

723
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:17,030
initially but I recognize this is a

724
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:19,490
legitimate delivery method the studies

725
00:30:17,029 --> 00:30:21,289
that we had you know 30 years of safety

726
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:24,140
studies from NIDA still have not

727
00:30:21,289 --> 00:30:26,928
uncovered any long-term harms from

728
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:30,290
smoking no long malignancy or or

729
00:30:26,929 --> 00:30:32,630
emphysema so I've embraced this but I'm

730
00:30:30,289 --> 00:30:35,629
curious about why you know patients are

731
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:39,470
talking about how vaporizing is good but

732
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:42,290
smoking is just a much more robust and

733
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:44,480
it seems to activate all these molecules

734
00:30:42,289 --> 00:30:46,399
in the plant that aren't you know really

735
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:49,099
activated by vaporizing which only gets

736
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:50,509
you to whatever 400 degrees and so

737
00:30:49,099 --> 00:30:52,849
there's something in the combustion that

738
00:30:50,509 --> 00:30:54,440
takes it to another level for patients

739
00:30:52,849 --> 00:30:57,409
and I think that's why it's still

740
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:58,910
preferred by so many people but not not

741
00:30:57,410 --> 00:31:00,019
optimal when you're dealing with the

742
00:30:58,910 --> 00:31:02,660
medical community

743
00:31:00,019 --> 00:31:04,879
so yeah anybody else out there I know

744
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:07,550
probably knew hi yes

745
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:09,590
so we talked we touched on you touched

746
00:31:07,549 --> 00:31:12,769
on actually both these talks touched on

747
00:31:09,589 --> 00:31:14,629
how important titration is and that

748
00:31:12,769 --> 00:31:17,150
often goes hand in hand with the idea

749
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:18,920
that there may be a bimodal dosing

750
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:20,360
response curve is that something that

751
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:22,880
you that this new study is going to be

752
00:31:20,359 --> 00:31:24,349
addressing or has addressed I wish we

753
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,240
don't have but I I know what you're

754
00:31:24,349 --> 00:31:29,000
saying everybody's so curious about this

755
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:31,670
biphasic response and we're not gonna

756
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,470
get to this is just an FDA phase 2 trial

757
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:35,570
so it's kind of early phase drug

758
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:37,670
development stays so but I'm hoping when

759
00:31:35,569 --> 00:31:39,529
we get to phase 3 we'll get into more

760
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:43,490
the nitty-gritty of that but the really

761
00:31:39,529 --> 00:31:45,789
good point you raise anybody else hi Sue

762
00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:49,160
yeah thank you for your contribution

763
00:31:45,789 --> 00:31:51,769
quick question when you do your trials

764
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:53,660
do you survey your participants if they

765
00:31:51,769 --> 00:31:55,250
consume other medication other

766
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:57,290
prescription medication do you suggest

767
00:31:55,250 --> 00:32:01,429
that they don't and only consume

768
00:31:57,289 --> 00:32:04,220
cannabis do you trial want to things

769
00:32:01,429 --> 00:32:06,320
they do have to wash off cannabis for at

770
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:09,319
least two weeks prior to starting the

771
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:11,299
study which screens out tons of patients

772
00:32:09,319 --> 00:32:13,669
right off the bat if they're semi

773
00:32:11,299 --> 00:32:16,730
dependent on it they automatically walk

774
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:18,950
away but it was actually really helpful

775
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:22,099
even people that were regular users

776
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:23,808
found the holid the drug holiday you

777
00:32:22,099 --> 00:32:26,269
know the two-week tolerance Brett was

778
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:28,579
was beneficial because it sort of helped

779
00:32:26,269 --> 00:32:30,279
re sensitize their receptors and so

780
00:32:28,579 --> 00:32:32,569
that's why even with this low quality

781
00:32:30,279 --> 00:32:34,730
cannabis from the government they were

782
00:32:32,569 --> 00:32:37,339
getting some good responses because they

783
00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:41,029
were so sensitive to it even though it

784
00:32:37,339 --> 00:32:42,709
was so diluted so that's one thing so

785
00:32:41,029 --> 00:32:45,170
they're not allowed to use any external

786
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:48,019
cannabis right once they enter the study

787
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:49,730
they're done with any and we have ways

788
00:32:48,019 --> 00:32:53,089
of testing for that to make sure that

789
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:55,308
they're only using ours and then what

790
00:32:53,089 --> 00:32:57,129
happens is oh in terms of other

791
00:32:55,308 --> 00:32:59,779
pharmacology so so the other

792
00:32:57,130 --> 00:33:02,150
pharmaceuticals that patients were on we

793
00:32:59,779 --> 00:33:04,369
asked them to maintain everything the

794
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:07,550
same right so if they were already on a

795
00:33:04,369 --> 00:33:10,029
cadre of of different psych of you know

796
00:33:07,549 --> 00:33:13,019
as long as it wasn't things like

797
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:16,889
steroids stuff that would prepare you

798
00:33:13,019 --> 00:33:19,139
would reduce inflammation or chemo

799
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:21,090
things like that but but basically if

800
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:23,130
they were on psych meds they were

801
00:33:21,089 --> 00:33:25,259
required to stay on whatever they were

802
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:26,730
taking if they were in psychotherapy you

803
00:33:25,259 --> 00:33:28,859
know getting cognitive behavioral

804
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:30,450
therapy they were required to stick with

805
00:33:28,859 --> 00:33:32,129
that throughout the trial not change

806
00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:34,350
anything because that could definitely

807
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:36,420
confound our results but that was the

808
00:33:34,349 --> 00:33:37,799
best way to do it otherwise imagine if I

809
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:44,550
was trying to take people off

810
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:46,169
paxil zola drawl they you know if you

811
00:33:44,549 --> 00:33:48,359
try to take somebody off a fax or

812
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:50,580
they're there and withdrawal four months

813
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:52,379
after that and that could really muddy

814
00:33:50,579 --> 00:33:56,329
the waters so we asked people just

815
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:56,330
remain on exactly what they were taking

816
00:33:57,319 --> 00:34:04,500
right here I know you guys want to go to

817
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:07,079
one I have a question hi dr. says hi hi

818
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:08,610
there um in terms of the litigation I'm

819
00:34:07,079 --> 00:34:11,069
a lawyer so I'm gonna ask the litigation

820
00:34:08,610 --> 00:34:13,530
question what's the status of the

821
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:15,840
litigation and like what phases it in

822
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:17,040
and then in general not just regarding

823
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:19,500
the litigation but is there anything

824
00:34:17,039 --> 00:34:22,320
that the folks in this room can do in

825
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:24,719
terms of advocacy civil disobedience I

826
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:26,669
don't know that you that you would

827
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:28,889
recommend to kind of put pressure put

828
00:34:26,668 --> 00:34:31,949
additional pressure on the federal

829
00:34:28,889 --> 00:34:33,690
government yeah I may I'm gonna tell you

830
00:34:31,949 --> 00:34:36,119
what I think and then I make it try to

831
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:40,769
connect you with my attorneys so this

832
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:44,429
Texas law firm yet or Coleman they are

833
00:34:40,769 --> 00:34:46,349
they filed the petition about it's a

834
00:34:44,429 --> 00:34:49,440
little over a month ago sometime in June

835
00:34:46,349 --> 00:34:51,898
we submitted and we've not had any

836
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:54,570
response yet from the court which is

837
00:34:51,898 --> 00:34:56,639
concerns me because I'm worried I don't

838
00:34:54,570 --> 00:35:00,090
know how this works if the case can go

839
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:02,250
stale over time and so right now what

840
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:04,200
we're doing the way that I'd say if

841
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:06,349
there's one call to action I have for

842
00:35:04,199 --> 00:35:09,059
everybody today is if you have

843
00:35:06,349 --> 00:35:11,670
connections with elected officials who

844
00:35:09,059 --> 00:35:14,429
care about this we may be able to submit

845
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:18,090
some amicus briefs I guess it's called

846
00:35:14,429 --> 00:35:19,859
where they could show their support that

847
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:22,530
way and maybe we could put pressure on

848
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:25,670
the courts to acknowledge this because

849
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:27,269
right now we have a commitment from

850
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:29,970
jared polin

851
00:35:27,269 --> 00:35:35,190
the governor in Colorado has agreed to

852
00:35:29,969 --> 00:35:37,889
write an amicus and also I a VA the Iraq

853
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:40,500
Afghanistan veterans so they have agreed

854
00:35:37,889 --> 00:35:42,799
because they already have policy about

855
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:45,269
this and American Legion is also

856
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:48,240
evaluating this for amicus support so

857
00:35:45,269 --> 00:35:50,639
I'm hoping that we but we'd love to get

858
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:54,419
other governors I we're trying to

859
00:35:50,639 --> 00:35:57,259
identify states where taxpayer dollars

860
00:35:54,420 --> 00:36:00,389
are going to fund trials using

861
00:35:57,260 --> 00:36:03,210
Mississippi cannabis and certainly here

862
00:36:00,389 --> 00:36:06,059
you're in danger of that because you

863
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:09,059
have all new research money coming out

864
00:36:06,059 --> 00:36:11,190
and anybody in in Europe you know

865
00:36:09,059 --> 00:36:13,679
California universities that are buying

866
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:16,860
that are trying to do control trials

867
00:36:13,679 --> 00:36:18,779
will be forced to buy the cannabis from

868
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:20,970
Mississippi instead of using your own

869
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:25,050
you know reg the state license cannabis

870
00:36:20,969 --> 00:36:28,500
so I think you guys have a real your

871
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:30,600
governor has a real basis to argue that

872
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:32,579
we need to end this monopoly so that you

873
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:35,460
don't waste any taxpayer dollars

874
00:36:32,579 --> 00:36:38,940
studying this and getting lousy outcomes

875
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:41,929
you know so if anybody knows Newsome or

876
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:45,030
any of the other you know congressmen

877
00:36:41,929 --> 00:36:47,099
certainly I think uh amicus from a

878
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:49,890
congressman's office could be valuable

879
00:36:47,099 --> 00:36:52,139
so yeah thank you for that question and

880
00:36:49,889 --> 00:36:57,750
I'll connect you with mine we have time

881
00:36:52,139 --> 00:36:59,608
for one more okay thank you so much dr.

882
00:36:57,750 --> 00:37:01,500
justice Lee really appreciate your your

883
00:36:59,608 --> 00:37:02,940
information is very valuable somebody

884
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:05,519
had mentioned earlier that you have a

885
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:08,670
registry a patient registry a very large

886
00:37:05,519 --> 00:37:12,269
one yes we what happened was we got

887
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:15,869
funding from Colorado State University

888
00:37:12,269 --> 00:37:18,599
to build an international registry that

889
00:37:15,869 --> 00:37:20,280
would basically be independent of the

890
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:22,349
industry so that it could get because

891
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:25,950
those data could be published later and

892
00:37:22,349 --> 00:37:27,989
if it had IRB approval in advance so

893
00:37:25,949 --> 00:37:31,618
that the data again could be publishable

894
00:37:27,989 --> 00:37:34,049
and what happened was the funding for

895
00:37:31,619 --> 00:37:36,539
the so we had a vendor in Colorado that

896
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:39,050
was supporting the plot that created the

897
00:37:36,539 --> 00:37:40,529
platform for me and was we were

898
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:43,080
collecting data

899
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:46,470
and then our funding ran out and the

900
00:37:43,079 --> 00:37:48,929
platform has now gone dark so I know

901
00:37:46,469 --> 00:37:50,730
this is heartbreaking so what we're

902
00:37:48,929 --> 00:37:52,859
doing is trying to seek out other

903
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:54,630
partners because this is so important

904
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:56,490
that we have you know the reason I was

905
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:59,070
pursuing the registry because I'm so

906
00:37:56,489 --> 00:38:01,589
desperate to get data from people using

907
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:03,750
real-world flour and even though it's

908
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:06,809
survey data it's still important because

909
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:08,449
it helps us look see trends when you get

910
00:38:06,809 --> 00:38:11,190
to the larger date you know once we have

911
00:38:08,449 --> 00:38:13,919
10,000 patients in the registry we'll

912
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:17,099
see trends that can help us fuel control

913
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:19,139
trials so so yeah if you know anybody

914
00:38:17,099 --> 00:38:21,210
who's who's interested in providing

915
00:38:19,139 --> 00:38:23,009
funding we're trying to rebuild the

916
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:24,960
platform and the good thing is we

917
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:27,270
already know how to do this we have the

918
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:30,539
you know the structure in place we just

919
00:38:27,269 --> 00:38:32,130
need to reopen it and probably work with

920
00:38:30,539 --> 00:38:34,259
a vendor that's not gonna be so

921
00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:37,320
expensive because that was just too

922
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:39,510
costly I might actually have somebody

923
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:41,400
for you a good friend of mine is a chief

924
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:43,080
clinical officer former chief clinical

925
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:44,910
officer from Providence Health and Human

926
00:38:43,079 --> 00:38:48,840
Services as you know as a very large

927
00:38:44,909 --> 00:38:50,489
healthcare system had also suggested the

928
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:52,620
same thing and I might hook you up with

929
00:38:50,489 --> 00:38:54,869
them how would be beautiful okay one

930
00:38:52,619 --> 00:38:55,480
