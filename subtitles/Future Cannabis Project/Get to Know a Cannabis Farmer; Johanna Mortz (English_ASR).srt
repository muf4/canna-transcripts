00:00:14,539 --> 00:00:21,269
I'm a small farmer in Mendocino County

3
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:24,778
we have applied for the 5,000 square

4
00:00:21,269 --> 00:00:28,170
foot permit but probably only have 2,500

5
00:00:24,778 --> 00:00:30,089
square feet and cultivation currently we

6
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:33,329
have been farming in Mendocino for the

7
00:00:30,089 --> 00:00:36,179
last 5 years and we are in the Willetts

8
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:39,420
appellation of Mendocino County and I

9
00:00:36,179 --> 00:00:42,719
think what makes us or our small tiny

10
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:47,129
little 5,000 square feet farm unique is

11
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:50,730
that we are at 2,500 feet elevation we

12
00:00:47,128 --> 00:00:55,289
have a lot of afternoon shade so we're

13
00:00:50,729 --> 00:00:57,779
not in full Sun we have really warm days

14
00:00:55,289 --> 00:01:00,808
but it never gets over a hundred and we

15
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:02,820
have cooler nights with a nice breeze so

16
00:01:00,808 --> 00:01:05,368
having cultivated in different counties

17
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:07,140
around Northern California I've found

18
00:01:05,368 --> 00:01:09,750
there's something very special about

19
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:12,900
that combination for where we are that

20
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:16,049
produces a really high-quality resin

21
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:19,049
content and a really nice looking Sun

22
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:21,930
grown flower there's not as much dust in

23
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:24,689
the air for me so it stays cleaner for

24
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:27,420
the first few years we have been really

25
00:01:24,688 --> 00:01:29,339
into testing genetics so we we tested a

26
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:33,180
lot of different varietals and a lot of

27
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:37,109
different genetics and I have really

28
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:40,310
kind of started enjoying the orange

29
00:01:37,109 --> 00:01:44,728
varietals I think they have a really

30
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:49,049
lovely terpene profile and something in

31
00:01:44,728 --> 00:01:51,828
that area makes it very clean tasting so

32
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:55,200
you really get the the orange flavor

33
00:01:51,828 --> 00:01:57,718
they have been pretty good at pest and

34
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,180
mold resistance especially in that area

35
00:01:57,718 --> 00:02:02,039
because we do get some moisture coming

36
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:05,219
in from the coast so something that's

37
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:09,099
mold resistant and not a really super

38
00:02:05,218 --> 00:02:15,579
large flower but still dense nugs

39
00:02:09,099 --> 00:02:19,329
I find that some of the more oh geez or

40
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:21,730
larger denser nug profiles tend to not

41
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:24,540
do as well although I'm really excited

42
00:02:21,729 --> 00:02:26,919
this year we are testing some from a

43
00:02:24,539 --> 00:02:29,229
friend who has a genetic company on the

44
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:32,259
coast who's been doing mixes and have

45
00:02:29,229 --> 00:02:36,159
kind of acclimatized to the the wetter

46
00:02:32,259 --> 00:02:38,849
areas so his name is Jessie Dodd with

47
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:41,680
bio vortex and he's an amazing amazing

48
00:02:38,849 --> 00:02:43,629
cultivator and regenerative farmer so

49
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,480
yeah really excited to see how those

50
00:02:43,629 --> 00:02:48,849
genetics do so we grow all of our plants

51
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:53,979
in the ground in soil and living soil I

52
00:02:48,849 --> 00:02:57,250
think it's becoming more it's becoming

53
00:02:53,979 --> 00:03:00,280
more popular it's coming back in my mind

54
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:02,080
growing outdoors in the ground because I

55
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:04,629
think that's how it originated that's

56
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:07,090
how a plant grows but I think because of

57
00:03:04,629 --> 00:03:09,129
prohibition and moving inside people

58
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:10,840
took to growing in pots and then when

59
00:03:09,129 --> 00:03:14,229
they could go back outside they just

60
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:17,349
kept the pots so I think that it's

61
00:03:14,229 --> 00:03:19,359
unique to us but not just to us it's not

62
00:03:17,349 --> 00:03:21,519
a Mendocino thing I think it's becoming

63
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:25,150
more popular especially with the terroir

64
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:28,360
and the Appalachians becoming a point of

65
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:31,000
focus people I think in order to really

66
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:32,740
know how your terroir affects your

67
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,889
cannabis you have to be in the ground

68
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:38,350
you have to be in your terroir for

69
00:03:35,889 --> 00:03:41,789
people that are not growing in the

70
00:03:38,349 --> 00:03:44,889
native soil in pots they're not really

71
00:03:41,789 --> 00:03:48,009
experiencing the full terroir or their

72
00:03:44,889 --> 00:03:50,559
full appellation so I would go as far as

73
00:03:48,009 --> 00:03:53,769
to say they can't really classify

74
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,300
themselves in any terroir because they

75
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:57,219
were only like halfway there they're

76
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:59,740
only getting the outside elements as

77
00:03:57,219 --> 00:04:01,180
opposed to what's in the ground and

78
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:03,820
what's in the ground is so important

79
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:11,319
because it's what's feeding the plant so

80
00:04:03,819 --> 00:04:13,509
we do all compost teas we actually my

81
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:15,489
partner is the mad scientist behind our

82
00:04:13,509 --> 00:04:17,978
compost teas he's who I've learned

83
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:20,810
everything from he's been on this beyond

84
00:04:17,978 --> 00:04:25,310
organic growing practices

85
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:27,050
for the past five years seven years so I

86
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:29,120
can't I don't know that compost tea

87
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:32,569
recipes but I know that we basically

88
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:34,790
feed our soil stuff for the bugs that's

89
00:04:32,569 --> 00:04:36,980
in the soil and then the bugs are what's

90
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:39,710
feeding the plant we don't use any

91
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:41,419
liquid nutrients or fertilizers we

92
00:04:39,709 --> 00:04:43,939
actually don't use any pesticides or

93
00:04:41,418 --> 00:04:46,819
fungicides we actually have a full

94
00:04:43,939 --> 00:04:48,589
integrated pest management program that

95
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:50,659
I've been working on for the last two

96
00:04:48,589 --> 00:04:53,329
years and I've really found really

97
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:55,220
awesome success with outside I think

98
00:04:53,329 --> 00:04:57,709
it's not about like not having anything

99
00:04:55,220 --> 00:05:01,790
out there it's about maintaining and

100
00:04:57,709 --> 00:05:04,129
knowing your ecosystem and so I have

101
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:05,930
with the testing regulations and

102
00:05:04,129 --> 00:05:09,560
everything going on right now our

103
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:10,939
biggest battle is microbiological but it

104
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:13,490
feels good to not ever have to worry

105
00:05:10,939 --> 00:05:16,490
about the pesticides well we have a

106
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:20,240
50-gallon brewer and we have a 1500

107
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:23,780
gallon Brewer that we only have five

108
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:26,478
acres and when we got that one my

109
00:05:23,779 --> 00:05:29,589
partner's intent was to do like all of

110
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:35,000
our other vegetation as well because at

111
00:05:29,589 --> 00:05:37,339
1500 gallons of tea is a lot of tea it's

112
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,490
been a really interesting and amazing

113
00:05:37,339 --> 00:05:41,869
learning journey for sure learning

114
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:44,720
everyday I think if you're not learning

115
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:48,800
you're not doing it right well we use

116
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:52,490
ladybugs so pretty constantly we use I

117
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:57,139
just released our last release of cocoon

118
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:59,538
muris mites and californica s-- i like

119
00:05:57,139 --> 00:06:03,589
the slow release sachets of the cocoon

120
00:05:59,538 --> 00:06:06,740
murus because seems like they like to

121
00:06:03,589 --> 00:06:09,369
stick around we also use green lace

122
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:12,168
wings we've used Trico

123
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:14,418
dirt awesome some of the names I'm a

124
00:06:12,168 --> 00:06:21,139
little but for for moths for

125
00:06:14,418 --> 00:06:24,978
caterpillars we use an der Sony and

126
00:06:21,139 --> 00:06:27,469
Swarovski I don't know there's there's

127
00:06:24,978 --> 00:06:30,709
kind of a own array depending on what

128
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:32,450
you're trying to combat and for me I

129
00:06:30,709 --> 00:06:36,349
like to kind of have a

130
00:06:32,449 --> 00:06:38,389
steady supply of a good few of them so

131
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:41,900
yeah I'm still learning I think it's

132
00:06:38,389 --> 00:06:44,269
super fascinating and we've been working

133
00:06:41,899 --> 00:06:47,959
with a beneficial and sectarian reading

134
00:06:44,269 --> 00:06:53,299
and I've been really excited to learn

135
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:56,139
from them and Kelly Vance that's really

136
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:56,139
going yeah

137
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:12,980
