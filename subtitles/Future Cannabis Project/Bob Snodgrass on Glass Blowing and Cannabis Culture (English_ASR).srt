00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:25,079
have here with us Bob Snodgrass

6
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:28,830
legendary glass maker educator amazing

7
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:30,989
human being and community leader and we

8
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:34,409
are talking about what you know where

9
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:37,320
cannabis has come from and you won a

10
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:39,988
Lifetime Achievement Award this year and

11
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:42,469
we would love to know how you're feeling

12
00:00:39,988 --> 00:00:42,468
about that

13
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:54,179
here we are it's 2018 I'm having

14
00:00:50,729 --> 00:00:58,019
flashbacks two days before any kind of

15
00:00:54,179 --> 00:01:02,030
regulation I remember a guy once telling

16
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:05,159
me that he used to make jello water and

17
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:07,290
sprays plants with it to get extra

18
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:10,670
weight well they're instantly didn't

19
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:15,380
want to smoke anymore of his weed but

20
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:19,228
today we were tested for how many

21
00:01:15,379 --> 00:01:25,699
terpenes what your THC is but also you

22
00:01:19,228 --> 00:01:30,959
get tests that say no mold and no

23
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:34,829
pesticide so that kind of reassurance

24
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:37,048
really brings in a healthy approach to

25
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:40,228
what we can do with our thousands of

26
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:43,170
strains so many have been developed that

27
00:01:40,228 --> 00:01:46,289
there are weird characteristics to so

28
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:51,019
many pots so if one of them doesn't work

29
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:54,840
for somebody find one that does because

30
00:01:51,019 --> 00:01:56,929
they all have a kind of a different

31
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:00,609
trait

32
00:01:56,930 --> 00:02:03,230
and then anyhow here yeah and so and so

33
00:02:00,609 --> 00:02:05,780
what have you really seen like you've

34
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:08,990
been in a really black market really

35
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:12,169
hidden you you've done a lot of Grateful

36
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:15,110
Dead tours so traveled with the Grateful

37
00:02:12,169 --> 00:02:16,879
Dead family and now being here at the

38
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:19,220
Emerald Cup in an event where obviously

39
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:21,729
there's a lot of Grateful Dead family

40
00:02:19,219 --> 00:02:25,639
all around all day today and yesterday

41
00:02:21,729 --> 00:02:27,829
what's it what's it like now in a being

42
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:31,789
with this whole family in a state of

43
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:37,580
legalization makes me giggle first off

44
00:02:31,789 --> 00:02:40,310
it's like yeah for the approach that we

45
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:42,860
have now we can walk out there and

46
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:46,120
there's a sign that says you can smoke

47
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:49,250
on this side and not on that side and

48
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:51,700
everybody can and everybody can carry I

49
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:58,009
see people carrying around clones and

50
00:02:51,699 --> 00:03:02,750
I'm just tickled the open sharing in the

51
00:02:58,009 --> 00:03:09,439
glass world opened it up that we've made

52
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:12,860
advances in glass tenfold at exponential

53
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:16,400
rates well this kind of event for

54
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:23,269
cannabis is allowing that exponential

55
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:25,620
ality to boil over into us growing

56
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:29,189
better pot and

57
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:31,890
my goal is a glassblower was to make a

58
00:03:29,189 --> 00:03:34,079
pipe that allowed it to operate that

59
00:03:31,889 --> 00:03:39,659
would let pot work at its maximum

60
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:42,390
potential and now we have so many

61
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:46,889
growers that are getting the pot to grow

62
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:49,829
at its maximum potentials and it's

63
00:03:46,889 --> 00:03:51,659
really exciting it's really exciting we

64
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:54,599
would like to you know thank you for

65
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:57,060
opening us up originally to clean

66
00:03:54,598 --> 00:03:58,859
cannabis smoking and being able to smoke

67
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:01,519
out of a glass pipe originally when it

68
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:04,470
was metal pipes and and dirty

69
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:06,269
apparatuses and and plastic bongs you

70
00:04:04,469 --> 00:04:09,030
know you really kind of helped us get

71
00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:12,810
into something clean in tin cans back in

72
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:15,329
the day when I first hit dead tour my

73
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:21,110
sales pitch was have you ever smoked out

74
00:04:15,329 --> 00:04:24,170
a glass because 99.9% of them hadn't and

75
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:24,170
[Music]

77
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:37,919

82
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:58,019
all over the world and I I gave away all

83
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:59,480

84
00:04:58,019 --> 00:05:02,608
