2
00:00:08,718 --> 00:00:16,320
we are first going to hear from Wade

3
00:00:12,199 --> 00:00:18,149
laughter on plans and solutions to get

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,949
medicine to our communities

5
00:00:18,149 --> 00:00:22,349
keeping medical cannabis relevant

6
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:24,750
language marketing we can use that

7
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:26,010
supports patients and future medicinal

8
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:29,689
laws and we're going to try to keep it

9
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:29,689
to about five minutes for you speaker

10
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:47,850
okay if it has to be five minutes then I

11
00:00:45,448 --> 00:00:52,768
would start off by saying that cannabis

12
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:55,530
as medicine works for in my experience

13
00:00:52,768 --> 00:00:59,939
an incredible range of conditions and

14
00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:01,920
the real trick is to to look at your

15
00:00:59,939 --> 00:01:03,419
end-user the person who's actually going

16
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,390
to be using the product you have

17
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:08,939
produced and make sure that that product

18
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:11,009
that the chemistry that's available in

19
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:14,310
that product is appropriate for your end

20
00:01:11,009 --> 00:01:17,579
user at a dose that's appropriate for

21
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:20,129
your end user with guidance to your end

22
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:22,950
user on how to use that preparation and

23
00:01:20,129 --> 00:01:27,569
what side effects or beneficial effects

24
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:30,240
they should expect and I know that for

25
00:01:27,569 --> 00:01:34,589
in my own life I started in this work as

26
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:38,039
a cultivator and organized a collective

27
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:40,799
that involved patients quote unquote

28
00:01:38,039 --> 00:01:43,829
under the prop 215 law here in

29
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:46,020
California that allowed groups of people

30
00:01:43,828 --> 00:01:49,289
to work together to provide medicine to

31
00:01:46,019 --> 00:01:51,170
those who most needed it and basically

32
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:54,149
the one of the issues that I have with

33
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:56,189
in California we have commercialized

34
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:58,200
cannabis not legalized it we have

35
00:01:56,188 --> 00:02:01,468
committed a heavily regulated commercial

36
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,780
activity and it's a shame because the

37
00:02:01,468 --> 00:02:05,640
only reason that happened is there are

38
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:08,219
so many people who can benefit from

39
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,689
cannabis with those guidelines that I

40
00:02:08,219 --> 00:02:11,819
just mentioned about dosage and

41
00:02:09,689 --> 00:02:13,469
chemistry and guidance on how to use it

42
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:15,209
there are so many people that can

43
00:02:13,469 --> 00:02:17,699
benefit from it that the laws that

44
00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:21,109
prohibition were based upon have been

45
00:02:17,699 --> 00:02:24,179
overturned in California you have a

46
00:02:21,109 --> 00:02:26,790
constitutional right in California to

47
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:29,780
access cannabis as medicine if you need

48
00:02:26,789 --> 00:02:32,578
it and yet we've set up these laws today

49
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:36,000
where patients the people who most need

50
00:02:32,579 --> 00:02:39,329
cannabis do not have access for the most

51
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:44,159
part in my own life number of years ago

52
00:02:39,329 --> 00:02:46,230
I I found a cultivar called Harlequin I

53
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:47,979
won't get into that story it's pretty

54
00:02:46,229 --> 00:02:49,389
out there and if you

55
00:02:47,979 --> 00:02:51,549
really want to hear the details ask me

56
00:02:49,389 --> 00:02:56,889
about it later because I only got five

57
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:58,810
minutes but but where that's really

58
00:02:56,889 --> 00:03:00,969
relevant is the among the very first

59
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:02,650
folks that I started interacting with

60
00:03:00,969 --> 00:03:05,620
who wanted something other than getting

61
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:09,670
stoned was people who were dealing with

62
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:12,370
pain and at first again I was just

63
00:03:09,669 --> 00:03:14,109
smoking and what was lovely about

64
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:15,870
Harlequin is it actually worked for pain

65
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:18,670
even if you were just smoking a joint

66
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:20,409
but pretty quickly folks with cancer

67
00:03:18,669 --> 00:03:24,009
started presenting themselves and the

68
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:27,310
one the one issue that really flipped

69
00:03:24,009 --> 00:03:29,769
everything for me personally was getting

70
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:33,310
involved with a family with a young

71
00:03:29,769 --> 00:03:35,590
child that had protracted long term

72
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:38,348
issues with epilepsy basically from

73
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:42,189
birth this person had been taking anti

74
00:03:38,348 --> 00:03:44,578
epileptic drugs when I met the family he

75
00:03:42,189 --> 00:03:47,889
was on 15 different pharmaceutical drugs

76
00:03:44,579 --> 00:03:49,689
totally locked up in rigor I know

77
00:03:47,889 --> 00:03:51,399
there's a technical term for that doctor

78
00:03:49,689 --> 00:03:54,129
so maybe you could elucidate but

79
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:57,609
basically in a wheelchair wearing

80
00:03:54,129 --> 00:04:00,039
diapers blind completely disconnected

81
00:03:57,609 --> 00:04:02,560
from the world and his parents loved

82
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:06,638
this child wanted him to be a successful

83
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:08,319
human being well today he is he's down

84
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:12,189
to one of those antiepileptic

85
00:04:08,318 --> 00:04:14,259
medications he can see again he no

86
00:04:12,189 --> 00:04:19,060
longer has to wear diapers he's 28 years

87
00:04:14,259 --> 00:04:20,858
old by the way this person and he when

88
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:24,009
he has to go to the bathroom he has

89
00:04:20,858 --> 00:04:25,240
enough ability to push himself up it's

90
00:04:24,009 --> 00:04:26,469
like he's trying to get out of his

91
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,788
wheelchair and that's when his parents

92
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:30,389
know oh he needs to go to the bathroom

93
00:04:27,788 --> 00:04:33,069
so he's no longer having to wear diapers

94
00:04:30,389 --> 00:04:35,379
when he's able to when he's hungry he's

95
00:04:33,069 --> 00:04:37,149
able to communicate that this is

96
00:04:35,379 --> 00:04:40,418
something that he needs he needs food

97
00:04:37,149 --> 00:04:42,549
and so you have to understand what that

98
00:04:40,418 --> 00:04:44,769
must feel like if you're a parent

99
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:46,810
consider what you would be dealing with

100
00:04:44,769 --> 00:04:48,788
if that was what your child was dealing

101
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:52,209
with and what's true is most all of us

102
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:53,709
take health for granted health is just a

103
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:56,139
beautiful thing it's a thing that

104
00:04:53,709 --> 00:05:00,009
happens but as you get older in your

105
00:04:56,139 --> 00:05:01,899
life or if your life is such that you're

106
00:05:00,009 --> 00:05:04,569
presented with the

107
00:05:01,899 --> 00:05:07,449
who has health issues or someone that

108
00:05:04,569 --> 00:05:11,159
you love in your life comes in to health

109
00:05:07,449 --> 00:05:13,469
issues this is where this plant can do I

110
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:15,250
I'm really reluctant to use the word

111
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:17,080
miraculous because it's not really a

112
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:19,779
miracle the plant is creating this

113
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:23,529
chemistry that mimics the chemistry our

114
00:05:19,779 --> 00:05:26,679
bodies create in order to create health

115
00:05:23,529 --> 00:05:29,889
in our bodies the endocannabinoid system

116
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:32,740
the way I think of it is it's the system

117
00:05:29,889 --> 00:05:35,949
that our body uses compounds signaling

118
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:37,930
compounds to help our tissues talk to

119
00:05:35,949 --> 00:05:41,229
each other so that the stomach and the

120
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:44,170
bile ducts and the gallbladder and the

121
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:45,550
pancreas and all of those things can

122
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:49,210
work together so we can digest the

123
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:51,639
breakfast we just had and take energy

124
00:05:49,209 --> 00:05:54,359
from that food process it and make it

125
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:57,939
available to us so that we can live and

126
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:59,470
what's true is I think that cannabis has

127
00:05:57,939 --> 00:06:01,930
become so important as a medicine

128
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:04,000
because the combination of food that

129
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:05,769
lacks proper nutrient and is

130
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,740
contaminated with all kinds of things

131
00:06:05,769 --> 00:06:10,539
there's a whole conversation there

132
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:13,300
toxins in the air the stress of our

133
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:16,180
culture on and on and on our bodies are

134
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:18,579
no longer able to successfully make the

135
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:21,550
endocannabinoids that we need to enjoy

136
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:23,349
health and for that reason we are

137
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:25,449
experiencing all of the health issues

138
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:29,439
that we are experiencing as a culture

139
00:06:25,449 --> 00:06:31,569
and what's lovely to me is so many of

140
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:34,600
them respond beautifully and perfectly

141
00:06:31,569 --> 00:06:37,120
to cannabis and so as cultivators as

142
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:39,310
people who work with cannabis I feel

143
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:42,069
like one of the central responsibilities

144
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:46,000
when you talk about ethics in our work

145
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:47,949
is to make this met this plant and the

146
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,980
medicine we can make from it available

147
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:53,889
to those who most need it and ideally it

148
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:55,930
would be at little or no cost because

149
00:06:53,889 --> 00:06:59,829
most people in our culture who are ill

150
00:06:55,930 --> 00:07:02,590
have no money the medical system sucks

151
00:06:59,829 --> 00:07:06,519
it up like a huge vacuum cleaner even if

152
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:08,589
you have good insurance so we all know

153
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:10,209
that when you set aside the rules and

154
00:07:08,589 --> 00:07:12,189
the laws and the licenses and all of

155
00:07:10,209 --> 00:07:13,870
that crap that we are all dealing with

156
00:07:12,189 --> 00:07:17,469
today the

157
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:19,720
the the pathogen of paper as it was

158
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:21,910
described yesterday if you set all of us

159
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:24,250
that aside the actual true cost of

160
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:26,139
cannabis medicine should be literally

161
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:29,769
pennies on the dollar for what it costs

162
00:07:26,139 --> 00:07:39,250
today and that's all I have to say

163
00:07:29,769 --> 00:07:42,849
that's almost five minutes to the

164
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:44,680
patients or terms or tools that you've

165
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:46,720
thought about or looking towards in the

166
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:48,459
future to be getting this to the

167
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:52,630
patient's supporting the patient

168
00:07:48,459 --> 00:07:53,739
supporting this movement two things

169
00:07:52,629 --> 00:07:55,769
about that

170
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:58,660
the biggest one is changing the rules

171
00:07:55,769 --> 00:08:02,529
here in California we blew it really

172
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:04,300
badly in terms of legalization because

173
00:08:02,529 --> 00:08:07,319
it's not legalization again it's highly

174
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:09,879
highly highly recommended regulated

175
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:14,790
commercialization which is definitely

176
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:17,589
not the same thing so at the state level

177
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:19,720
an organization that I've done a lot of

178
00:08:17,589 --> 00:08:21,699
work with the khalad rias Network we put

179
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:27,160
some effort into changing state law in

180
00:08:21,699 --> 00:08:28,810
California khalad Reyes see al a d RI us

181
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:30,640
it's you'll have to go back to the

182
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:33,219
Wayback Machine online to find

183
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:35,588
information about our work because we

184
00:08:33,219 --> 00:08:38,229
shut down state law required the

185
00:08:35,589 --> 00:08:40,270
cessation of collective activity at the

186
00:08:38,229 --> 00:08:42,400
beginning of this year and so the

187
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:46,389
collaboration network our mission

188
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:48,399
statement was to provide education and

189
00:08:46,389 --> 00:08:50,470
if appropriate cannabis therapies to the

190
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:54,669
families of catastrophic ly ill children

191
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:56,740
at no cost to those families ever when

192
00:08:54,669 --> 00:09:00,789
we shut down in January we've had a

193
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:03,220
hundred and forty six families that we

194
00:09:00,789 --> 00:09:04,779
were helping directly by providing

195
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:08,470
products that were appropriate to their

196
00:09:04,779 --> 00:09:11,949
child's needs and another 700 or so that

197
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:15,310
were in line if you will in our intake

198
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:18,820
process to qualify for what we were

199
00:09:15,309 --> 00:09:19,989
doing and when we had to shut down at

200
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:22,810
the beginning this year we did a big

201
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:24,759
push to get those meds out to those

202
00:09:22,809 --> 00:09:27,219
families hoping that we would be able to

203
00:09:24,759 --> 00:09:30,088
rectify the situation by the end of this

204
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:32,790
year we did successfully get through

205
00:09:30,089 --> 00:09:35,829
compassion bill at the state level that

206
00:09:32,789 --> 00:09:38,740
excludes all cannabis products that are

207
00:09:35,828 --> 00:09:45,878
donated from taxation which is a huge

208
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:47,799
thing so so really the model that we

209
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:52,079
used is collab in clavius network is

210
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:55,289
nurseryman cultivators manufacturers

211
00:09:52,078 --> 00:09:57,489
laboratories distributors and retailers

212
00:09:55,289 --> 00:09:59,409
to whatever extent they could

213
00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:02,889
contributed some portion of their work

214
00:09:59,409 --> 00:10:05,318
to our efforts at no cost to us so that

215
00:10:02,889 --> 00:10:09,879
we could in turn pass those medicines on

216
00:10:05,318 --> 00:10:12,159
to the families at no cost and again if

217
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:14,199
you are a cultivator and know lots and

218
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:16,600
lots and lots about cannabis and how it

219
00:10:14,198 --> 00:10:18,219
works in your garden open yourself to

220
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,680
the idea that there are people in your

221
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:23,709
community who could benefit from the

222
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:26,229
material that you're making and I assure

223
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:28,628
you I knew nothing I I did not know what

224
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:31,120
CBD was when I learned that Harlequin

225
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:34,000
was as high CBD strain I've learned a

226
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:36,850
lot about what CBD does and what it can

227
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,769
do for people and some of the compounds

228
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:41,740
the chemistry that this plant is capable

229
00:10:38,769 --> 00:10:43,688
of in the years since then and I assure

230
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:45,399
you that all of you can educate

231
00:10:43,688 --> 00:10:48,519
yourselves about what cannabis as

232
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:51,039
medicine can do for people that you love

233
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:53,589
and what you can do in terms of creating

234
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:55,179
products and in Japan the last thing

235
00:10:53,589 --> 00:10:59,129
that I would like to say about what you

236
00:10:55,179 --> 00:11:02,528
asked for is to do with products

237
00:10:59,129 --> 00:11:05,170
basically everybody that wants to smoke

238
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:08,528
a joint can smoke a joint you can find

239
00:11:05,169 --> 00:11:11,878
joints all across the country around the

240
00:11:08,528 --> 00:11:14,438
world it's a highly illegal drug and yet

241
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:17,199
without any advertising without any

242
00:11:14,438 --> 00:11:20,019
distribution budget without any we have

243
00:11:17,198 --> 00:11:23,528
put it all over the world you can find a

244
00:11:20,019 --> 00:11:25,528
joint anywhere that's cool the problem

245
00:11:23,528 --> 00:11:29,169
is most of the people who really need

246
00:11:25,528 --> 00:11:30,970
cannabis aren't smoking joints start

247
00:11:29,169 --> 00:11:34,208
learning about the products the ways

248
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:36,459
that you can prepare this plant into a

249
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:39,759
form be it a sublingual tincture or a

250
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:42,969
topical or nasal spray

251
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:44,769
or capsules that people are ingesting or

252
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:47,490
edibles there's so many different ways

253
00:11:44,769 --> 00:11:53,259
the real trick is to get the chemistry

254
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:56,019
into the body at a dose that the user

255
00:11:53,259 --> 00:11:58,210
not only can tolerate but won't be

256
00:11:56,019 --> 00:12:00,490
frightened because one of the stories I

257
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:04,060
hear again and again is oh I tried

258
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:06,490
cannabis lost my mind for eight hours I

259
00:12:04,059 --> 00:12:08,109
mean I ate it and it's a terrible drug

260
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:10,779
and I never want anything to do with it

261
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:13,389
again and that person lost the

262
00:12:10,779 --> 00:12:22,889
opportunity to experience the wellness

263
00:12:13,389 --> 00:12:22,889
that's possible from this plant that's

264
00:12:34,359 --> 00:12:40,429
well it's a perfect segue because Mike

265
00:12:38,178 --> 00:12:42,948
Frost is going to be talking with us

266
00:12:40,428 --> 00:12:45,818
about products that have worked for

267
00:12:42,948 --> 00:12:48,198
patients products that farmers can make

268
00:12:45,818 --> 00:12:58,639
products that have medicinal value of

269
00:12:48,198 --> 00:13:01,278
experience thank you very much

270
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:02,839
I really appreciate being here Wade you

271
00:13:01,278 --> 00:13:04,668
covered a lot of good stuff already on

272
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:06,739
kind of the types of products but

273
00:13:04,668 --> 00:13:09,408
getting you know how can you get that

274
00:13:06,739 --> 00:13:11,689
into your body now switching it over to

275
00:13:09,408 --> 00:13:14,749
what's easy for the farmers

276
00:13:11,688 --> 00:13:17,808
well thanks you're straight activated

277
00:13:14,749 --> 00:13:19,908
oil sticking in some topicals it's not

278
00:13:17,808 --> 00:13:22,968
that difficult to get you know that

279
00:13:19,908 --> 00:13:25,249
medicine out of the plan I guess the way

280
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:26,839
I'd look at it right now is what's the

281
00:13:25,249 --> 00:13:29,719
easiest way to get it out and the

282
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:33,049
cleanest and more from a perspective of

283
00:13:29,719 --> 00:13:34,849
a guess get get us out of the way of it

284
00:13:33,048 --> 00:13:38,749
the beauty is sitting there in the plan

285
00:13:34,849 --> 00:13:40,669
so you know we learn to you know move

286
00:13:38,749 --> 00:13:43,069
away from the harmful methods of

287
00:13:40,668 --> 00:13:45,198
extracting and get into what's you know

288
00:13:43,068 --> 00:13:48,528
a little bit more clean but anything

289
00:13:45,198 --> 00:13:51,708
whether it's you know ethanol you know

290
00:13:48,528 --> 00:13:54,678
bubble hash you know squish and stuff

291
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:57,858
those are just great ways to get that

292
00:13:54,678 --> 00:14:00,708
oil out once you get that oil out the

293
00:13:57,859 --> 00:14:03,769
most beautiful thing to work with is

294
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:07,908
coconut oil people love it

295
00:14:03,769 --> 00:14:09,859
yeah MCT oil is has been a huge deal you

296
00:14:07,908 --> 00:14:12,188
know in all of us so that's how we blend

297
00:14:09,859 --> 00:14:16,549
their topicals that's all make tinctures

298
00:14:12,188 --> 00:14:19,668
the Pats right now we got coconut drops

299
00:14:16,548 --> 00:14:22,968
that are just you know oil mixed with

300
00:14:19,668 --> 00:14:27,168
MCT and and about a third of real

301
00:14:22,969 --> 00:14:29,209
organic coconut oil and it's really cool

302
00:14:27,168 --> 00:14:31,159
to have your dog come up and you know

303
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:32,628
you put a couple drops on your hand

304
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:34,578
and they come up to take the medicine

305
00:14:32,629 --> 00:14:36,199
right off your hand you know before it

306
00:14:34,578 --> 00:14:37,789
was you know try to get a capsule down

307
00:14:36,198 --> 00:14:39,708
you know a dog's mouth that's just I

308
00:14:37,789 --> 00:14:43,879
mean that's a traumatic thing for you

309
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:45,739
know a human or a pet but the methods

310
00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:48,500
are really easy you can do a lot with

311
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:50,600
without a lot of equipment so if you can

312
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:53,269
get alkyl if you can get if you can get

313
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:55,339
coconut oil MCT you can put your plants

314
00:14:53,269 --> 00:14:57,799
right in there heat up the oil you know

315
00:14:55,339 --> 00:15:00,019
take some cheesecloth to get get your

316
00:14:57,799 --> 00:15:02,059
material out of there and then put it

317
00:15:00,019 --> 00:15:07,129
into anything you want but literally we

318
00:15:02,059 --> 00:15:10,609
use that for our textures and all the

319
00:15:07,129 --> 00:15:13,009
topicals when we first started making

320
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:14,629
the oils for the capsules so capsules

321
00:15:13,009 --> 00:15:16,220
and lotions is pretty much you know but

322
00:15:14,629 --> 00:15:19,610
you know our family started working with

323
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:21,410
and the capsules were they couldn't have

324
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:24,019
been more simple it was just get some

325
00:15:21,409 --> 00:15:26,480
activated oil Rick Simpson oil style oil

326
00:15:24,019 --> 00:15:27,980
and that's how I got into this was you

327
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,430
know I had I had three people tell me

328
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:33,589
about the cancer curing properties of

329
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:36,679
cannabis and I knew nothing about this

330
00:15:33,589 --> 00:15:38,449
and so finally checked it out and learn

331
00:15:36,679 --> 00:15:42,500
how to grow a plant and get some extract

332
00:15:38,448 --> 00:15:44,719
out but what we did is get that

333
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:46,818
activated oil down suck it into a

334
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:49,310
syringe and then you have it you know

335
00:15:46,818 --> 00:15:52,250
your ability to store it for the Rick

336
00:15:49,309 --> 00:15:54,349
Simpson oil type of method of dosing it

337
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:57,259
came out to wear out of that syringe if

338
00:15:54,350 --> 00:16:00,500
you had a like a half a half a grain of

339
00:15:57,259 --> 00:16:01,970
rice you know for was it you have three

340
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:04,789
times a day for four days and you just

341
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:06,379
keep bumping that up and then you'll

342
00:16:04,789 --> 00:16:08,719
build up your tolerance so it's not

343
00:16:06,379 --> 00:16:11,028
freaking people out and because if you

344
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:13,009
can hallucinate I'm sure you know some

345
00:16:11,028 --> 00:16:14,480
of us have been there but it's you know

346
00:16:13,009 --> 00:16:17,930
it's traumatic for people that are just

347
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:19,730
looking for medicine but that was the

348
00:16:17,929 --> 00:16:21,739
best way to do it and that half a green

349
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:24,800
rice coming out of that syringe that's

350
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:26,899
about ten milligrams of THC which ended

351
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:30,889
up being our and kind of a dose you know

352
00:16:26,899 --> 00:16:32,600
in Washington and around as they get

353
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:34,399
going you know they can build up that

354
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:37,269
tolerance and the idea is you're gonna

355
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:39,649
take the whole syringe of that a day so

356
00:16:37,269 --> 00:16:41,720
in a real quick couple minutes that's

357
00:16:39,649 --> 00:16:44,419
kind of the range from a quick you know

358
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:45,080
quick topical to here's a full cancer

359
00:16:44,419 --> 00:16:47,029
treatment

360
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:48,860
but the idea is that you're gonna take

361
00:16:47,029 --> 00:16:50,509
60 of those grams

362
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:52,370
you know maybe over a course of you know

363
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:54,259
two or three months and really it's

364
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:57,769
about can you bring in that much

365
00:16:54,259 --> 00:17:00,620
medicine without freaking out from my

366
00:16:57,769 --> 00:17:05,779
experience and I don't know if this is

367
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:07,190
legitimate data but yes I should also

368
00:17:05,779 --> 00:17:08,838
throw out the most of people that have

369
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:10,910
been working with or my age and older

370
00:17:08,838 --> 00:17:12,829
and all the way up to an 83 year old gal

371
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:15,080
so there none of them want to get high

372
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:17,119
but at that time we didn't have the CBD

373
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:20,419
you know you know piece to add in there

374
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:22,399
and add value there so we would get

375
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:25,220
people ramping up and trying to build up

376
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:27,320
this tolerance but the male's I found

377
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:29,450
and it could have been just coincidence

378
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:33,769
but I could not get them to take the

379
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:35,480
full 1 gram deal the look and I mean I

380
00:17:33,769 --> 00:17:37,369
understand it it's it's heavy you know I

381
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:43,160
you know I test it and I've never taken

382
00:17:37,369 --> 00:17:45,109
a full gram of oil either but yeah but

383
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:47,390
I've taken enough to get me out of

384
00:17:45,109 --> 00:17:49,339
normal smoking weed range and you know

385
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:53,330
get in some really cool hallucinations

386
00:17:49,339 --> 00:17:54,639
too but that's yeah that's a different

387
00:17:53,329 --> 00:17:57,879
thing

388
00:17:54,640 --> 00:18:03,980
yeah yeah exactly

389
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:07,340
but but what I have found is we did get

390
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:09,680
good good get good results and the

391
00:18:07,339 --> 00:18:11,689
females and the older especially older

392
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:15,170
females they were able to get to that

393
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:16,759
one gram no problem and I mean I'm we

394
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:18,080
can have some discussions afterwards to

395
00:18:16,759 --> 00:18:20,359
see if there's anything that you guys

396
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:24,169
have experienced on is there a you know

397
00:18:20,359 --> 00:18:27,409
male female element or not but we had

398
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:29,810
one gal 83 year old Gao accidentally

399
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:32,630
start dosing herself and got up to 4

400
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:34,429
grams in a day and she's a pretty

401
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:36,500
connected plant person I mean she's

402
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:38,539
she's been learning you know indigenous

403
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:40,250
stuff for a long time so I say you want

404
00:18:38,539 --> 00:18:41,960
to go for it but she was she got

405
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:44,569
diagnosed with a real aggressive type of

406
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:46,700
cancer and she knew she didn't have the

407
00:18:44,569 --> 00:18:48,710
time to just you know start trying to

408
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:51,980
stretch stuff out or will this work and

409
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:53,840
I just told her I think the best thing

410
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:56,509
and you know I really it said I think I

411
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:57,849
don't know I don't know a lot but from

412
00:18:56,509 --> 00:19:01,299
experience

413
00:18:57,849 --> 00:19:04,299
I think that there's more power and

414
00:19:01,299 --> 00:19:06,700
blasting somebody and just putting them

415
00:19:04,299 --> 00:19:08,919
down and you're gonna be down for a few

416
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:13,029
days just go through that through this

417
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:15,190
and I've seen you know we've seen tumors

418
00:19:13,029 --> 00:19:16,839
you know nodules and you know lymph

419
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:18,580
nodes and stuff go away that have been

420
00:19:16,839 --> 00:19:21,220
photographed I mean like within a month

421
00:19:18,579 --> 00:19:24,220
and a half I did this with a guy at work

422
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:28,029
in the information technology career he

423
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:30,100
was literally dropping snake type things

424
00:19:28,029 --> 00:19:32,259
out of this syringe into coffee right

425
00:19:30,099 --> 00:19:35,230
next to me so I had to learn this while

426
00:19:32,259 --> 00:19:36,730
I'm doing my other career and luckily

427
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:39,460
have been you know fortunate enough to

428
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:41,200
get out here and you know try to not you

429
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:42,730
know try to make it living it's know I

430
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,920
want to work with this thing this can

431
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:46,900
change people this hemp plant can change

432
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:49,600
their planet this is this can bring

433
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:51,490
people together you know it's possible

434
00:19:49,599 --> 00:19:53,349
we could clean up water and air it's

435
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:55,720
possible we could have maybe a

436
00:19:53,349 --> 00:19:59,679
replacement plastic I mean this thing is

437
00:19:55,720 --> 00:20:01,870
a huge topic and you know if this is

438
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:04,120
doable the really switch you know kind

439
00:20:01,869 --> 00:20:07,449
of the culture and get moving on this

440
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:09,699
hemp thing Holly I was talking with I'm

441
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:11,980
going casters like is this really doable

442
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:16,269
that we could switch and have this much

443
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:18,610
of a an industry impact on the planet by

444
00:20:16,269 --> 00:20:21,250
switching just the topic of hemp to

445
00:20:18,609 --> 00:20:23,229
regenerative farming I'm watching and

446
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:26,079
seeing two potential pathways going out

447
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:28,569
and one of them is oh my god if we

448
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:30,549
continue our you know same agricultural

449
00:20:28,569 --> 00:20:33,250
practices to produce this easy to make

450
00:20:30,549 --> 00:20:35,889
medicine we're gonna take something that

451
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:37,720
really has the potential to put us in a

452
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:40,870
better position to have sustainable life

453
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:43,150
here and then the opposite it's just not

454
00:20:40,869 --> 00:20:44,379
cool so I guess you know when I walked

455
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:47,590
into this room and I'm pretty new to

456
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:49,450
this community to see how much power you

457
00:20:47,589 --> 00:20:51,429
guys have and all of your knowledge and

458
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:53,740
the heart and passion which is the real

459
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:55,990
driver but take that heart passion and

460
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:57,490
drive it down the real pathway you guys

461
00:20:55,990 --> 00:21:02,940
are giving me confidence that this

462
00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:02,940
actually you know it can happen so

463
00:21:03,049 --> 00:21:12,169
I want to add something I want to add

464
00:21:08,269 --> 00:21:14,299
something the high doses that this

465
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:17,090
brother was just speaking of can be

466
00:21:14,299 --> 00:21:20,509
really important and helpful for a few

467
00:21:17,089 --> 00:21:22,549
conditions in your communities but most

468
00:21:20,509 --> 00:21:26,119
of the people who are seeking help want

469
00:21:22,549 --> 00:21:28,220
small doses they want a little bit we

470
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:31,549
don't need these huge doses and the

471
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:36,819
beauty of that point of view is in your

472
00:21:31,549 --> 00:21:39,769
kitchen in olive oil or MCT you can make

473
00:21:36,819 --> 00:21:41,629
concentrated preparations that will be a

474
00:21:39,769 --> 00:21:43,789
benefit to most of the people that you

475
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:47,900
will encounter most people don't need a

476
00:21:43,789 --> 00:21:50,480
whole gram of oil THC a day because that

477
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:52,730
is a huge thing a lot a lot of people

478
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:56,480
that we've worked with get benefit from

479
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:59,329
five or ten milligrams you know over the

480
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:02,029
course of a whole day and it's my Arnaud

481
00:21:59,329 --> 00:22:04,730
Hezekiah is the analytical chemist and

482
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:07,009
for the Netherlands cannabis program and

483
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:10,250
he did a study on extractions what

484
00:22:07,009 --> 00:22:11,930
where's the best capture of the terpenes

485
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:14,630
and cannabinoids present in the cannabis

486
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:18,620
plant and he found that olive oil done

487
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:21,170
on a kitchen stove is the best capture

488
00:22:18,619 --> 00:22:24,349
of the original chemistry in that plant

489
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:27,080
the limitation is he could only get up

490
00:22:24,349 --> 00:22:29,809
to about 10 milligrams per milliliter of

491
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:32,359
the material he was making but in fact

492
00:22:29,809 --> 00:22:34,970
10 milliliters 10 milligrams in a

493
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:38,869
milliliter is a pretty effective dose

494
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:40,400
for a lot of conditions just got to say

495
00:22:38,869 --> 00:22:42,169
again these people are not looking to

496
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:49,820
get stoned they're looking for benefit

497
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:52,340
available in that chemistry just wanted

498
00:22:49,819 --> 00:22:53,899
to add in that you know yeah just

499
00:22:52,339 --> 00:22:55,399
everybody coming together like this you

500
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:57,080
can look at is like okay it's a you know

501
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,400
synchronistic you know types of things

502
00:22:57,079 --> 00:23:02,029
that are occurring and you know

503
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:03,500
recognizing that is just amazing but you

504
00:23:02,029 --> 00:23:04,250
know we haven't talked you know we want

505
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:07,519
you know we're gonna have a little

506
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:09,500
conversation about harlequin so it's

507
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:12,319
it's pretty unique that i'm sitting here

508
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:15,769
next to you in and in this group because

509
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:19,460
Harlequin came into Washington State

510
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:22,519
and somehow it came to us and we spread

511
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:26,660
that as much as we could and so same

512
00:23:22,519 --> 00:23:28,759
thing yeah nice so I appreciate your

513
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:31,519
work so I don't know how I don't know

514
00:23:28,759 --> 00:23:33,500
how you know it got in there but when

515
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:35,029
the CBD piece came out and we talked

516
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:37,549
about the efficacy in the healing the

517
00:23:35,029 --> 00:23:40,700
CBD piece brings in all of the anxiety

518
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:43,099
health the bipolar schizophrenia we've

519
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:45,620
stopped we've stopped suicides from

520
00:23:43,099 --> 00:23:48,759
occurring with CBD that's super powerful

521
00:23:45,619 --> 00:23:52,279
it's just a quick question about

522
00:23:48,759 --> 00:23:55,519
efficacy of of those doses you're

523
00:23:52,279 --> 00:23:58,789
talking about when you're when you're

524
00:23:55,519 --> 00:24:01,369
giving a big dose like that would it be

525
00:23:58,789 --> 00:24:03,289
more efficacious to infuse that into a

526
00:24:01,369 --> 00:24:05,539
little bit of oil at least and then not

527
00:24:03,289 --> 00:24:07,579
have to give as big of a dose or it

528
00:24:05,539 --> 00:24:09,769
seems like having that fat would bring

529
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:12,139
it into the body faster so instead of

530
00:24:09,769 --> 00:24:14,240
putting the snake of real sticky in the

531
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:17,090
mouth wouldn't you want to make that a

532
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:19,789
little more easy for them taking because

533
00:24:17,089 --> 00:24:22,069
we've all put our sore or freako in our

534
00:24:19,789 --> 00:24:30,500
mouths and it's like if you think about

535
00:24:22,069 --> 00:24:32,480
a whole snake okay yeah just a quick

536
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:34,490
response on that yeah absolutely if you

537
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:37,460
can have some fats in there to deal with

538
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:40,160
the whole stomach issue you know without

539
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:42,890
getting too gross you know Nick that's a

540
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:44,840
helpful segue into that topic of that 83

541
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:47,030
year old gal who she started noticing

542
00:24:44,839 --> 00:24:48,709
that some medicine might be coming out

543
00:24:47,029 --> 00:24:51,049
of her before getting the you know

544
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:53,360
absorbed into the system and yeah it was

545
00:24:51,049 --> 00:24:55,399
you know adding the you know the oil or

546
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:57,649
make sure you eaten some fats means it

547
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:59,509
fats are great ice cream I don't know if

548
00:24:57,650 --> 00:25:02,950
that's a real deal but ice cream seems

549
00:24:59,509 --> 00:25:02,950
to really really work well

550
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:16,490
and different cannabinoids and olive oil

551
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:19,880
has definitely produced the higher

552
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:22,519
cannabinoid batches time after time it's

553
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:25,160
good to then mix it with coconut oil but

554
00:25:22,519 --> 00:25:31,279
the olive oil has consistently been the

555
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:34,250
winner hi so I'm a medical intuitive and

556
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:36,079
shamanic practitioner for 30 years and

557
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:39,890
I've been working with patients for the

558
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:40,609
last almost four years with exactly what

559
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:44,480
you're talking about

560
00:25:40,609 --> 00:25:47,719
and titrating up okay so but what I also

561
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:50,690
do and I do this myself is I take it

562
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:53,569
suppository I make my own pills I

563
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:56,929
started out with point one oh I'm up to

564
00:25:53,569 --> 00:25:59,990
0.5 oh that's that's my range so I

565
00:25:56,929 --> 00:26:02,210
titrate it up until the next morning I I

566
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:04,669
was feeling you know really kind of

567
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:08,419
stone and I backed it off a bit and

568
00:26:04,669 --> 00:26:09,740
that's my dose and suppository it put

569
00:26:08,419 --> 00:26:11,720
surpasses your brain in your liver

570
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:13,880
pretty much so you don't get high and

571
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:15,798
you're getting the medicine in you I've

572
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:17,809
never had a digestive system better than

573
00:26:15,798 --> 00:26:25,460
now my bowels are better than ever just

574
00:26:17,808 --> 00:26:27,829
so you all know so you know so I mean

575
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:31,720
when I work with patients I work with

576
00:26:27,829 --> 00:26:35,089
CBD crude I work with full-spectrum

577
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:39,100
ara so we call a ppm pure plant medicine

578
00:26:35,089 --> 00:26:41,449
I work with THC a crystals I combine

579
00:26:39,099 --> 00:26:43,399
depending on what it is like you know

580
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:47,169
Parkinson's patients I'm going to use a

581
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:49,780
higher you know CBD 1 or CBD you know

582
00:26:47,169 --> 00:26:52,250
that's going to go into for the

583
00:26:49,779 --> 00:26:54,798
neurological system if it's somebody

584
00:26:52,250 --> 00:27:01,539
who's in pain I'm gonna use higher ppm

585
00:26:54,798 --> 00:27:05,418
and you know maybe more of a THC a

586
00:27:01,539 --> 00:27:07,819
mixture so you know again when you're

587
00:27:05,419 --> 00:27:10,280
working with your plant you know the

588
00:27:07,819 --> 00:27:12,019
person everybody's everybody's different

589
00:27:10,279 --> 00:27:13,609
everybody cells are different so maybe

590
00:27:12,019 --> 00:27:15,798
have them get an endocannabinoid test

591
00:27:13,609 --> 00:27:18,199
that's what I'm having my patients do

592
00:27:15,798 --> 00:27:20,000
first thing you come to me getting into

593
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:23,960
Kannamma Neri test so I can see what

594
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:25,849
your cells will and will not accept yeah

595
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:27,460
and so that gives you a start then you

596
00:27:25,849 --> 00:27:29,980
know what to grow then you know how to

597
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:34,579
proceed with that particular patient

598
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:42,019
yeah so so that I guess I'm leading into

599
00:27:34,579 --> 00:27:45,129
to to me on how my journey that brought

600
00:27:42,019 --> 00:27:45,129
me here sorry

601
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:59,240
exactly yeah

602
00:27:55,160 --> 00:28:02,870
so um as you as I talked about in the

603
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:05,690
first night I was diagnosed on January

604
00:28:02,869 --> 00:28:08,899
24th of this year with Stage four

605
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:11,059
ovarian cancer my tumors were grew so

606
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:13,160
quickly they grew two and a half

607
00:28:11,059 --> 00:28:16,940
centimeters in less than seven days I

608
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:19,940
had three masses one on each ovary and

609
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:23,120
one behind by the time of my surgery on

610
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:25,309
February 6th my masses were six point

611
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:28,849
four and four point nine and three point

612
00:28:25,309 --> 00:28:31,299
four they debunked me meaning they did

613
00:28:28,849 --> 00:28:34,669
they did a complete hysterectomy

614
00:28:31,299 --> 00:28:38,089
laparoscopically they found they took

615
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:41,450
out pieces of my body and found I was

616
00:28:38,089 --> 00:28:44,599
87% malignant so they opened me up and

617
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:47,000
they took eight organs out they closed

618
00:28:44,599 --> 00:28:49,699
me back up and and no uncertain terms

619
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,950
said if you do not do chemo and

620
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:53,779
radiation you will die and the

621
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:55,940
fear-mongering that goes on is

622
00:28:53,779 --> 00:28:58,519
incredible they said to Layton in front

623
00:28:55,940 --> 00:29:02,170
of my children if you don't make her do

624
00:28:58,519 --> 00:29:04,879
chemo you will kill her this is on you

625
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:08,810
so the fear-mongering that goes on is

626
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:11,360
terrible but that leads me to I found a

627
00:29:08,809 --> 00:29:14,450
wonderful natural path I chose my

628
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:16,490
doctors my team of doctors I said this

629
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:21,769
is who I want to work with I did all of

630
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:23,960
my testing up front right so I did the

631
00:29:21,769 --> 00:29:25,609
endocannabinoid test I did something

632
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:27,079
called the Charis test which showed me I

633
00:29:25,609 --> 00:29:29,389
wasn't him I wasn't able to do

634
00:29:27,079 --> 00:29:32,240
immunotherapy I did something called the

635
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:33,180
our GCC test which this is what told me

636
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,490
what herbs

637
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:38,970
News so I found a really good natural

638
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:41,279
path and he put me on 15 different herbs

639
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:45,120
I take a hundred and thirty pills a day

640
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:47,099
it's keeping me alive and this is what

641
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:49,259
I'd like to really talk about how we

642
00:29:47,099 --> 00:29:54,389
could how you could help people like me

643
00:29:49,259 --> 00:29:59,970
it's not just cannabis we need herbs we

644
00:29:54,390 --> 00:30:01,890
need herbs we need whole food and so

645
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:03,779
think about it if you if you plant a

646
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:05,940
tomato plant and you put a pepper plant

647
00:30:03,779 --> 00:30:07,289
next to it what's going to happen you're

648
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:09,330
going to have some of those properties

649
00:30:07,289 --> 00:30:12,029
from the root into the tomato plant

650
00:30:09,329 --> 00:30:14,750
right so the same thing what can happen

651
00:30:12,029 --> 00:30:18,960
if you plant something like bin weed or

652
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:21,690
seek help or hi you know turkey kale or

653
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:23,309
that's gonna seep into your cannabis too

654
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:25,170
and the cannabis is gonna seep into

655
00:30:23,309 --> 00:30:26,819
those you're gonna be able to make all

656
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:29,400
these other herbs which I need

657
00:30:26,819 --> 00:30:32,970
desperately I'm spending we're spending

658
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:36,120
three thousand dollars a month on herbs

659
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:38,730
alone it shouldn't be like this

660
00:30:36,119 --> 00:30:41,009
right so and there's a lot of people out

661
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:43,259
there that really want to do this route

662
00:30:41,009 --> 00:30:45,420
but insurance doesn't cover it they

663
00:30:43,259 --> 00:30:47,789
don't they look at me and go we we might

664
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:49,920
help you with your rent but we won't pay

665
00:30:47,789 --> 00:30:53,369
for your herbs we won't pay for your

666
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:54,930
medicine so this is I think you know

667
00:30:53,369 --> 00:30:57,239
something that we could really talk

668
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:59,310
about and come together as a collective

669
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:01,859
to say not only we are we going to give

670
00:30:59,309 --> 00:31:03,480
the cannabis plant this beautiful plant

671
00:31:01,859 --> 00:31:05,849
the sacred plant the medicine that we

672
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:07,890
can get from her but also all of the

673
00:31:05,849 --> 00:31:10,079
other plants that go with it

674
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:11,970
that people like me who you know it's

675
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:14,250
these this is saving my life

676
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:17,069
and I take you know half a gram

677
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:22,410
suppository at night for my cannabis and

678
00:31:17,069 --> 00:31:26,970
I have no scar tissue for months a

679
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:30,870
14-inch scar no scar tissue right that's

680
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:35,250
cannabis so I think an the way to get it

681
00:31:30,869 --> 00:31:37,829
into our society is you know talk to

682
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:39,960
your local wellness centers they are

683
00:31:37,829 --> 00:31:42,299
really into this you know talk to them

684
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:44,069
about what you have to offer and you

685
00:31:42,299 --> 00:31:46,428
know maybe then do some lecturing and

686
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:48,710
some you know just educating

687
00:31:46,429 --> 00:31:51,429
your community on you-know-what because

688
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:54,110
everyone knows somebody who has cancer

689
00:31:51,429 --> 00:31:55,519
statistics one out of two men one out of

690
00:31:54,109 --> 00:31:57,888
three women in the next year are gonna

691
00:31:55,519 --> 00:32:00,829
get it so we really need to talk about

692
00:31:57,888 --> 00:32:04,519
this because somebody you love is gonna

693
00:32:00,829 --> 00:32:08,118
get it and so doing something you know

694
00:32:04,519 --> 00:32:11,778
like really get involved with the other

695
00:32:08,118 --> 00:32:14,569
thing I did was my first patient had

696
00:32:11,778 --> 00:32:17,240
breast cancer she talked to the liaison

697
00:32:14,569 --> 00:32:19,189
who was the liaison for the eastern and

698
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:22,069
western part of our Hospital we actually

699
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:23,720
had somebody like this intern this woman

700
00:32:22,069 --> 00:32:26,178
called me we sat down and had a

701
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:28,519
conversation I taught her about

702
00:32:26,179 --> 00:32:30,919
regenerative organic cannabis and

703
00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:32,868
because we're in Connecticut I think I

704
00:32:30,919 --> 00:32:35,509
mean the only place you can get cannabis

705
00:32:32,868 --> 00:32:37,278
is in the dispensary and she was like I

706
00:32:35,509 --> 00:32:39,860
don't want to get it here what do I do

707
00:32:37,278 --> 00:32:42,409
I said but until it's federally I can't

708
00:32:39,859 --> 00:32:46,248
even though I was like you know don't

709
00:32:42,409 --> 00:32:49,129
tell anybody but you know but you know

710
00:32:46,249 --> 00:32:52,249
talk to your hospital who has a you know

711
00:32:49,128 --> 00:32:54,019
an alternative person and you know they

712
00:32:52,249 --> 00:32:55,399
really believe me they've been thinking

713
00:32:54,019 --> 00:32:57,470
about this for years

714
00:32:55,398 --> 00:32:59,748
and they want it to come into the

715
00:32:57,470 --> 00:33:02,089
hospitals so that I think is one of the

716
00:32:59,749 --> 00:33:04,700
best ways we can maybe bridge or East

717
00:33:02,089 --> 00:33:07,278
and West so that there's not so much

718
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:09,048
fear because you know as dr. Russo will

719
00:33:07,278 --> 00:33:11,028
tell you the doctor is you know they're

720
00:33:09,048 --> 00:33:12,648
they're doing their job and if they step

721
00:33:11,028 --> 00:33:14,690
out of that box a little bit they're

722
00:33:12,648 --> 00:33:17,508
gonna lose their license so until the

723
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:19,820
day that they get educated and and maybe

724
00:33:17,509 --> 00:33:22,278
saying yeah go ahead and try that I

725
00:33:19,819 --> 00:33:24,710
didn't tell you to do it but go ahead

726
00:33:22,278 --> 00:33:27,169
and do it instead of if you don't make

727
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:29,538
her do chemo you're gonna kill her and

728
00:33:27,169 --> 00:33:33,230
this is what I would like to see happen

729
00:33:29,538 --> 00:33:35,658
with everyone you know working with this

730
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:38,389
plant and get out and to your community

731
00:33:35,659 --> 00:33:44,420
and talk to these people who had can

732
00:33:38,388 --> 00:33:47,339
help you make a difference yeah thanks

733
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:49,590
[Applause]

734
00:33:47,339 --> 00:33:52,158
[Music]

735
00:33:49,589 --> 00:33:56,788
real quick one of the things I add to

736
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:57,990
Pauline if you're working with someone

737
00:33:56,788 --> 00:34:00,419
and you're going to provide them

738
00:33:57,990 --> 00:34:01,679
cannabis as medicine make sure you ask

739
00:34:00,419 --> 00:34:04,288
them if they are taking any

740
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:06,028
pharmaceutical drugs turns out there's

741
00:34:04,288 --> 00:34:08,369
lots of pharmaceutical drugs that have

742
00:34:06,028 --> 00:34:11,429
interactions some which are harmful to

743
00:34:08,369 --> 00:34:13,559
the end-user with cannabis and typically

744
00:34:11,429 --> 00:34:15,059
what goes on is those pharmaceutical

745
00:34:13,559 --> 00:34:17,549
drugs do not get broken down and

746
00:34:15,059 --> 00:34:19,980
eliminated by our bodies particularly

747
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:22,710
CBD slowed certain metabolic pathways

748
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:24,000
and so in stand what at the position

749
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:25,679
I've taken instead of trying to educate

750
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,710
myself in all of these different

751
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:31,019
pharmaceutical drugs is I tell the

752
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:33,568
person talk to the doctor who prescribed

753
00:34:31,019 --> 00:34:35,909
your medication and two things happen

754
00:34:33,568 --> 00:34:38,579
there one the doctor gets to sign off on

755
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:40,108
whether or not this prescription drug is

756
00:34:38,579 --> 00:34:42,329
going to work with the cannabis or not

757
00:34:40,108 --> 00:34:44,429
and two they're likely to get more

758
00:34:42,329 --> 00:34:46,230
educated about cannabis which i think is

759
00:34:44,429 --> 00:34:48,389
a really important thing doctors need

760
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:51,179
this education they need to understand

761
00:34:48,389 --> 00:34:52,800
that it's not scary that there are

762
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:54,628
potential side effects but for the most

763
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:58,589
part the side effects are nothing

764
00:34:54,628 --> 00:35:02,789
compared to pharmaceutical drugs Thank

765
00:34:58,588 --> 00:35:05,299
You Valerie couldn't be here and she has

766
00:35:02,789 --> 00:35:09,300
written something that Sarah is going to

767
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:11,940
read for us and this is about how as a

768
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:14,099
collective we can get out education to

769
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:16,950
consumers and how we can get medicine to

770
00:35:14,099 --> 00:35:20,970
patients hi everyone I was given the

771
00:35:16,949 --> 00:35:25,469
task of representing Valerie and it's an

772
00:35:20,969 --> 00:35:27,269
honor and it's also impossible so I'm

773
00:35:25,469 --> 00:35:30,269
just gonna be a conduit for her wisdom

774
00:35:27,269 --> 00:35:34,380
and as I'm reading I'll maybe jump in

775
00:35:30,269 --> 00:35:36,150
and give a little context so thank you

776
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:38,099
for indulging me and listening as my

777
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:40,950
lovely friend Sarah Russo represents

778
00:35:38,099 --> 00:35:43,289
Wham during this time of evolution I can

779
00:35:40,949 --> 00:35:45,689
feel the buzz of the hive even 300 miles

780
00:35:43,289 --> 00:35:48,300
away and why I delight at the thought of

781
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:50,220
communing with you Buchan by the song of

782
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:52,890
mother cannabis I am called to be at the

783
00:35:50,219 --> 00:35:55,869
bedside of my own mother so Valerie

784
00:35:52,889 --> 00:35:59,799
chorale has worked for decades

785
00:35:55,869 --> 00:36:02,949
in the cannabis space WAM is her

786
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:04,870
collective that started shortly after

787
00:36:02,949 --> 00:36:07,569
the medical law was passed in California

788
00:36:04,869 --> 00:36:10,989
and they're based in Santa Cruz and they

789
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:13,450
offer patients free medicine that who

790
00:36:10,989 --> 00:36:16,449
are terminally ill and she also does

791
00:36:13,449 --> 00:36:18,819
hospice work so she's been holding

792
00:36:16,449 --> 00:36:22,599
people's hands as they transition for a

793
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:24,160
very long time and so she actually gets

794
00:36:22,599 --> 00:36:26,039
the opportunity to do that with her mom

795
00:36:24,159 --> 00:36:31,179
so that's really beautiful

796
00:36:26,039 --> 00:36:32,860
um why everything cannabis in cannabis

797
00:36:31,179 --> 00:36:35,559
is changing the thing that remains is

798
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:37,870
our deepening relationship with her but

799
00:36:35,559 --> 00:36:40,029
nature reveals pathways to surviving in

800
00:36:37,869 --> 00:36:42,269
such critical time when commercialism

801
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:44,680
threatens to Korean out-of-balance

802
00:36:42,269 --> 00:36:46,420
displacing farmers and businesses

803
00:36:44,679 --> 00:36:49,539
critically abandoning sick and dying

804
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:52,900
people but she reminds us to open and to

805
00:36:49,539 --> 00:36:55,900
soften to listen more deeply to the

806
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:57,880
earth to each other's truths that she

807
00:36:55,900 --> 00:37:00,340
expands our consciousness moves our

808
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:02,920
hearts and strengthens our resolve in

809
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:05,340
nature everything in the forest grows

810
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:07,690
symbolically seeking balance

811
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:10,470
interdependent as a necessary part of

812
00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:14,190
the whole the demand that legalization

813
00:37:10,469 --> 00:37:16,389
have brought forward around a rigorous

814
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:18,670
revealing that we cannot survive in

815
00:37:16,389 --> 00:37:21,269
isolation from in competition with each

816
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:23,409
other but we may thrive in unity

817
00:37:21,269 --> 00:37:25,329
reminding us that we are a part of

818
00:37:23,409 --> 00:37:28,509
something greater than ourselves

819
00:37:25,329 --> 00:37:31,539

healing is inherent in each of us and

there is no panacea no magic potion or

provides proves to provide an

extraordinary career to potential and

859
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:18,820
modality for healing is as complex as

860
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:20,530
each individual and is as interdependent

861
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:22,350
as the systems that reside within all of

862
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:26,620
us

863
00:39:22,349 --> 00:39:28,599
and like the system our networks must

864
00:39:26,619 --> 00:39:31,329
also work symbolically to flourish

865
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:33,069
prosper and serve strengthen through

866
00:39:31,329 --> 00:39:34,960
this our same collective model for

service to everyone we will have joined

868
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:39,429
forces with an enchanted network of some

869
00:39:37,389 --> 00:39:42,639
of the most storied experienced and

870
00:39:39,429 --> 00:39:46,089
prolific producers to create a web of

871
00:39:42,639 --> 00:39:48,579
service donating services and products

872
00:39:46,090 --> 00:39:50,200
taking on the cultivation efforts to

873
00:39:48,579 --> 00:39:53,230
serve and carry on our decades-long

874
00:39:50,199 --> 00:39:55,599
mission the financial costs are great to

875
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:57,309
rebuild within this context but by

876
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:59,500
joining together to create a small

877
00:39:57,309 --> 00:40:01,630
dispensary with a true community center

878
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:03,269
bringing the therapist from our

879
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:05,920
community that supports their work

880
00:40:03,269 --> 00:40:08,619
educational sharing expanding the

881
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:12,070
framework of healing and offering many

882
00:40:08,619 --> 00:40:13,869
upper alternative applications as we are

883
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:16,390
able to re-emerge as a truly

884
00:40:13,869 --> 00:40:18,130
community-based an interdependent and

885
00:40:16,389 --> 00:40:20,920
supportive system focused on helping

886
00:40:18,130 --> 00:40:22,809
people heal themselves this is very

887
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:25,059
important meeting of the hive demands

888
00:40:22,809 --> 00:40:26,889
it's the greatest opportunities arise

889
00:40:25,059 --> 00:40:29,920
from sharing our skills and knowledge

890
00:40:26,889 --> 00:40:41,289
and enhance our individual experience we

891
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:42,909
are all greater with each other and I

892
00:40:41,289 --> 00:40:45,610
just want to say about Valerie that you

893
00:40:42,909 --> 00:40:47,799
know as far as being a part of the

894
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:50,710
movement she's a foundational key player

895
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:53,769
in this whole scene and she always

896
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:56,199
reminds me of the need to first of all

897
00:40:53,769 --> 00:41:00,130
work for the plant more than anything

898
00:40:56,199 --> 00:41:01,599
and each other and hold us all in

899
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:03,369
integrity with that and I think that

900
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:07,059
right now it's really easy to get lost

901
00:41:03,369 --> 00:41:09,609
and to feel like while marketing is

902
00:41:07,059 --> 00:41:10,840
important and making money for your life

903
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:14,260
of the hood is obviously important that

904
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:16,000
to not lose sight of that so you know

905
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:17,890
there's been a lot of people who've been

906
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,119
doing it for as long as she had well not

907
00:41:17,889 --> 00:41:21,069
a lot of people but the people that have

908
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:23,409
been doing it as long as she have some

909
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:25,870
of them have faced other routes of

910
00:41:23,409 --> 00:41:27,909
success and she just stays true to her

911
00:41:25,869 --> 00:41:30,880
integrity and her intentions in her work

912
00:41:27,909 --> 00:41:33,250
so and just a personal story I wanted to

913
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:37,300
share about her when I was 17 I went to

914
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:40,000
my first ICRS conference and I met

915
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:42,310
Valerie and I smoked Halle weed for the

916
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,719
first time and it was her stuff and it

917
00:41:42,309 --> 00:41:47,860
was amazing it was a definitely

918
00:41:43,719 --> 00:41:49,299
different world and um we got to go see

919
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:51,160
her farm so was the first time I got to

920
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:54,400
see cannabis growing and of course it's

921
00:41:51,159 --> 00:41:57,369
beautiful and amazing property and got

922
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:59,680
to be with family for a while and soon

923
00:41:57,369 --> 00:42:03,849
after that happened they were raided by

924
00:41:59,679 --> 00:42:05,949
the federal government and but actually

925
00:42:03,849 --> 00:42:10,170
they got raided and then they sued the

926
00:42:05,949 --> 00:42:13,359
federal government and then they won so

927
00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:13,360
[Applause]

928
00:42:14,449 --> 00:42:31,039
thank you and we're gonna move right

929
00:42:26,489 --> 00:42:34,229
along to Martin Lee and Zoey Sigmund and

930
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:36,570
who are going to discuss with us ideas

931
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:40,260
on how we get the word out that we

932
00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:44,460
support plant as medicine education how

933
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:46,950
do we do this you know I love I love the

934
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:49,050
hive metaphor if you will but I I think

935
00:42:46,949 --> 00:42:51,480
that this group is more like a school of

936
00:42:49,050 --> 00:42:54,150
fish because it sort of undulates and

937
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:55,740
hive is it it it conjures a sense of

938
00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:58,110
such efficiency you know that that

939
00:42:55,739 --> 00:43:01,559
insect amazing insect intelligence of

940
00:42:58,110 --> 00:43:06,000
everybody working no I didn't say that I

941
00:43:01,559 --> 00:43:08,099
said but and also you know a school of

942
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:11,039
fish so that has these very very movable

943
00:43:08,099 --> 00:43:16,349
boundaries I kind of fit smart anyways

944
00:43:11,039 --> 00:43:18,539
so education in a project CBD that's

945
00:43:16,349 --> 00:43:20,069
what we are we would engage of this for

946
00:43:18,539 --> 00:43:22,079
10 years since we were involved in

947
00:43:20,070 --> 00:43:25,170
introducing CBD into the medical

948
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:26,909
community in California but in terms of

949
00:43:25,170 --> 00:43:30,630
Education I think technically the word

950
00:43:26,909 --> 00:43:33,000
means in Latin to lead out so what does

951
00:43:30,630 --> 00:43:35,940
it mean if we're school of fish how do

952
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,920
we move the school of fish from where we

953
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:39,809
are to where we're going I think that's

954
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:43,680
the challenge of Education and it's very

955
00:43:39,809 --> 00:43:45,150
tricky very very tricky sure we can have

956
00:43:43,679 --> 00:43:46,829
lots of information we have lots of

957
00:43:45,150 --> 00:43:48,900
information about her and on a website

958
00:43:46,829 --> 00:43:50,279
about a particular minor cannabinoid or

959
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:51,869
a receptor and this and that's all

960
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:54,530
really oil really interesting and

961
00:43:51,869 --> 00:43:57,359
important but I think at this point

962
00:43:54,530 --> 00:43:59,430
given what we've seen how to transpire

963
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:01,170
over the last 10 years I think you know

964
00:43:59,429 --> 00:44:04,349
we're looking at maybe sort of raising

965
00:44:01,170 --> 00:44:07,619
the stakes a little bit more I'm

966
00:44:04,349 --> 00:44:10,019
reminded of a circle that Wade was at

967
00:44:07,619 --> 00:44:11,489
Sarah was at about ten years ago nine

968
00:44:10,019 --> 00:44:15,119
years ago is right around this time of

969
00:44:11,489 --> 00:44:18,269
year it's either December 2010 January

970
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:20,429
2011 where a group of people is about

971
00:44:18,269 --> 00:44:21,900
two dozen maybe more were sitting in a

972
00:44:20,429 --> 00:44:23,849
circle like this and taught and

973
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:25,079
everybody had some kind of interest or

974
00:44:23,849 --> 00:44:27,299
involvement with CBD

975
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:29,849
which was very new at the time it was

976
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:33,570
barely introduced into into the Calif

977
00:44:29,849 --> 00:44:35,190
into Northern California and everyone

978
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:37,320
went around the room at that point

979
00:44:35,190 --> 00:44:38,970
saying well kind of where they're at and

980
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:42,360
what they thought this was all gonna

981
00:44:38,969 --> 00:44:44,429
mean and what it might mean and and I

982
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:46,500
remember very distinctly when I when it

983
00:44:44,429 --> 00:44:49,079
was my turn to speak I emphasize two

984
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:50,909
things I said that CBD is a social

985
00:44:49,079 --> 00:44:54,269
medicine it's not just an individual

986
00:44:50,909 --> 00:44:57,690
medicine and that what we were doing and

987
00:44:54,269 --> 00:44:59,880
introducing it into into the community

988
00:44:57,690 --> 00:45:02,579
was a lot like an acupuncturist putting

989
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:04,500
a needle in a body and turning it and we

990
00:45:02,579 --> 00:45:05,250
were gonna see what energies were were

991
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:09,599
Unleashed

992
00:45:05,250 --> 00:45:12,090
from turning that needle whoa I mean the

993
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:14,219
energies that were Unleashed were well

994
00:45:12,090 --> 00:45:17,280
we're in the midst of it and not all

995
00:45:14,219 --> 00:45:20,159
good obviously but for for project CBD

996
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:21,810
because we've emphasized CBD as a focus

997
00:45:20,159 --> 00:45:23,909
of our work and I should say we we've

998
00:45:21,809 --> 00:45:25,860
never been involved in privilege in one

999
00:45:23,909 --> 00:45:28,469
compound over anything else in the plant

1000
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:30,420
and we reject that idea but always

1001
00:45:28,469 --> 00:45:33,299
emphasizing a whole plant but with CBD

1002
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:34,710
as a as important element it was a new

1003
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:37,110
thing at the time so it really the

1004
00:45:34,710 --> 00:45:38,550
educational challenge was just telling

1005
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:41,490
ringing the bell like the Hunchback of

1006
00:45:38,550 --> 00:45:44,039
Notre Dame CBD CBD what it is what it is

1007
00:45:41,489 --> 00:45:46,189
we don't have to do that anymore you

1008
00:45:44,039 --> 00:45:50,279
know now that Kim Kardashian is having a

1009
00:45:46,190 --> 00:45:52,710
CBD themed baby showers you know so what

1010
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:54,360
what what is that what does it mean for

1011
00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:56,099
us it means that we actually you know

1012
00:45:54,360 --> 00:46:00,360
all the sudden got a very very large

1013
00:45:56,099 --> 00:46:03,900
audience with that just from doing what

1014
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:05,640
we were doing and not just the numbers I

1015
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:07,530
mean earlier in the air we were over a

1016
00:46:05,639 --> 00:46:09,539
million page views a month on our

1017
00:46:07,530 --> 00:46:11,460
website it's gone down quite a bit

1018
00:46:09,539 --> 00:46:14,880
because we we're not kissing Google's

1019
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:16,289
ring properly apparently but and and and

1020
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:20,280
you know that's just the way it goes but

1021
00:46:16,289 --> 00:46:24,809
what one thing that's really striking in

1022
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:26,370
these just how unusual it is the

1023
00:46:24,809 --> 00:46:28,409
different the difficulties and

1024
00:46:26,369 --> 00:46:30,750
challenges when faces within the

1025
00:46:28,409 --> 00:46:32,279
cannabis industry as it's now called or

1026
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:34,230
the kind of as community as I would

1027
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:36,120
prefer to call it there's just some

1028
00:46:34,230 --> 00:46:38,860
unprecedented things that you have to

1029
00:46:36,119 --> 00:46:40,239
deal with from a business point of view

1030
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:42,160
that you don't have to deal with in any

1031
00:46:40,239 --> 00:46:43,929
other business and a perfect example

1032
00:46:42,159 --> 00:46:45,670
sort of tying together some of the

1033
00:46:43,929 --> 00:46:47,949
things we've discussed you know I know

1034
00:46:45,670 --> 00:46:49,900
product makers where they they're very

1035
00:46:47,949 --> 00:46:51,759
concerned about organic growing and

1036
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:54,130
getting good quality flour in they test

1037
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:55,600
the flour the flour passes they do a

1038
00:46:54,130 --> 00:46:57,640
concentrate new there's always the

1039
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:59,319
danger that whatever is in there the

1040
00:46:57,639 --> 00:47:01,150
residues you know could concentrate to

1041
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:03,460
the point of being beyond allowable

1042
00:47:01,150 --> 00:47:05,650
limits they test the oil the oil is

1043
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:07,389
perfect and then they mix it with the

1044
00:47:05,650 --> 00:47:10,059
chocolate and they have their chocolate

1045
00:47:07,389 --> 00:47:12,730
and then it fails why because of the

1046
00:47:10,059 --> 00:47:14,829
cadmium levels in the chocolate so you

1047
00:47:12,730 --> 00:47:17,260
have different standards you have the

1048
00:47:14,829 --> 00:47:20,259
cannabis product makers are actually

1049
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:22,330
held to a higher standard than anyone

1050
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:23,770
else and then you think about that we

1051
00:47:22,329 --> 00:47:24,849
could say on the one hand it's unfair

1052
00:47:23,769 --> 00:47:27,489
but then maybe there's an opportunity

1053
00:47:24,849 --> 00:47:29,019
here maybe we should lift the standards

1054
00:47:27,489 --> 00:47:30,879
up for everybody else so that the

1055
00:47:29,019 --> 00:47:32,679
cadmium levels aren't going to be in the

1056
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:35,769
chocolate for everybody not just for

1057
00:47:32,679 --> 00:47:37,089
cannabis makers so that and that's the

1058
00:47:35,769 --> 00:47:39,639
kind of the spirit of what I want to

1059
00:47:37,090 --> 00:47:41,530
introduce in the few moments more I have

1060
00:47:39,639 --> 00:47:42,849
before I turn it over to Zoe you know

1061
00:47:41,530 --> 00:47:46,180
one of the things we're thinking about

1062
00:47:42,849 --> 00:47:49,029
at project CBD we actually started it is

1063
00:47:46,179 --> 00:47:51,669
- we put out special reports now and

1064
00:47:49,030 --> 00:47:53,440
then and oftentimes they're on more

1065
00:47:51,670 --> 00:47:55,210
medical science related things we just

1066
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:57,389
put out a report on the the vaping

1067
00:47:55,210 --> 00:48:00,130
crisis where we identify it's synthetic

1068
00:47:57,389 --> 00:48:02,319
so called synthetic marijuana is really

1069
00:48:00,130 --> 00:48:07,150
a key culprit that's being ignored here

1070
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:10,510
and and numbered we put out a big report

1071
00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:12,039
on CBD and THC drug interactions with

1072
00:48:10,510 --> 00:48:13,600
pharmaceutical we just thought this is

1073
00:48:12,039 --> 00:48:15,759
something that would be helpful for dot

1074
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:17,529
for physicians but what we'd like to do

1075
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:19,750
is put out a report on cannabis in the

1076
00:48:17,530 --> 00:48:22,240
green new deal and while I'm not really

1077
00:48:19,750 --> 00:48:25,090
fixated on federal level politics and

1078
00:48:22,239 --> 00:48:28,449
stuff there is an invert a invitation

1079
00:48:25,090 --> 00:48:30,550
that's been put out by AOC and Bernie

1080
00:48:28,449 --> 00:48:32,919
Sanders and others and saying we want to

1081
00:48:30,550 --> 00:48:35,110
hear from local communities we were

1082
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:37,300
relying on local communities to drive a

1083
00:48:35,110 --> 00:48:40,890
green new deal so let's call their bluff

1084
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:43,600
you know so what we intend to do is is

1085
00:48:40,889 --> 00:48:45,579
both emphasize you know some of the best

1086
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:47,670
in terms of the experiment that is going

1087
00:48:45,579 --> 00:48:50,199
on when we think about cannabis as

1088
00:48:47,670 --> 00:48:52,329
laboratory experiment and democracy was

1089
00:48:50,199 --> 00:48:52,759
how Brandeis the great chief justice of

1090
00:48:52,329 --> 00:48:55,099
all

1091
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:58,550
imagine if we had you know justices like

1092
00:48:55,099 --> 00:49:00,349
that today another thing he mentioned

1093
00:48:58,550 --> 00:49:02,600
that you can't have democracy and in

1094
00:49:00,349 --> 00:49:04,339
morbid inequality either the two don't

1095
00:49:02,599 --> 00:49:05,779
go together and the whole point of the

1096
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:08,780
green New Deal is to address both

1097
00:49:05,780 --> 00:49:11,510
environmental crisis and and the crisis

1098
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:13,640
of inequality and I think that the

1099
00:49:11,510 --> 00:49:15,680
cannabis the best of the cannabis

1100
00:49:13,639 --> 00:49:17,239
community as embodied here really in

1101
00:49:15,679 --> 00:49:19,639
terms of regenerative agriculture and

1102
00:49:17,239 --> 00:49:22,219
many other aspects really has something

1103
00:49:19,639 --> 00:49:23,779
to offer to speak to what what has been

1104
00:49:22,219 --> 00:49:26,750
called for in terms of a green new deal

1105
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:31,190
and the same way I think the cannabis

1106
00:49:26,750 --> 00:49:33,289
industry has would benefit tremendously

1107
00:49:31,190 --> 00:49:34,550
if it would embody the ethos of agree

1108
00:49:33,289 --> 00:49:36,650
new deals because so much of the

1109
00:49:34,550 --> 00:49:38,180
cannabis industry doesn't so we intend

1110
00:49:36,650 --> 00:49:40,070
to put out a report that will examine

1111
00:49:38,179 --> 00:49:42,500
will look at both sides of it kind of

1112
00:49:40,070 --> 00:49:46,610
dispassionately saying here are examples

1113
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:48,139
of what should be supported on beyond

1114
00:49:46,610 --> 00:49:50,329
even the local level oh that's what

1115
00:49:48,139 --> 00:49:51,619
counts most are the kind of things that

1116
00:49:50,329 --> 00:49:54,199
if you want to make a green new deal

1117
00:49:51,619 --> 00:49:55,509
real well let's look to what what what

1118
00:49:54,199 --> 00:49:58,009
work has been done in the cannabis

1119
00:49:55,510 --> 00:50:00,230
community that that really speaks to

1120
00:49:58,010 --> 00:50:02,300
that in so many different ways so to me

1121
00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:04,369
here being here listening to what people

1122
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:06,560
are talking about I can give a lots of

1123
00:50:04,369 --> 00:50:06,980
examples just one yesterday jumped out

1124
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:08,570
at me

1125
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:12,289
you know you can't sell food and

1126
00:50:08,570 --> 00:50:14,120
cannabis at a car a farmers market you

1127
00:50:12,289 --> 00:50:15,650
can't sell anything besides cannabis in

1128
00:50:14,119 --> 00:50:18,019
a dispensary you know you can't sell

1129
00:50:15,650 --> 00:50:21,380
other herbs that's ridiculous you know

1130
00:50:18,019 --> 00:50:24,500
and given how such a key you know

1131
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:26,720
vector driving disease is the processed

1132
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:28,579
food industry wouldn't you want people

1133
00:50:26,719 --> 00:50:30,079
to come out to a farmers market because

1134
00:50:28,579 --> 00:50:32,269
they want to get their cannabis and then

1135
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:33,980
look at all these great all this other

1136
00:50:32,269 --> 00:50:36,739
great food I mean you want to put the

1137
00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:38,090
two together and yet our policies are

1138
00:50:36,739 --> 00:50:40,009
all wrong in that regard

1139
00:50:38,090 --> 00:50:41,690
that's a state-level policy so I mean

1140
00:50:40,010 --> 00:50:43,010
but I think well what's let's lay it out

1141
00:50:41,690 --> 00:50:45,740
well what if you actually had good

1142
00:50:43,010 --> 00:50:48,320
policies what would they really be so in

1143
00:50:45,739 --> 00:50:50,559
addition to kind of examining examples

1144
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:52,640
of experiment and examples of problems

1145
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:55,029
also make some recommendations

1146
00:50:52,639 --> 00:50:57,409
specifically for what a green new deal

1147
00:50:55,030 --> 00:50:59,840
how how much it could benefit from

1148
00:50:57,409 --> 00:51:02,149
cannabis and how much it needs cannabis

1149
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:06,059
and I think beyond that we also want to

1150
00:51:02,150 --> 00:51:08,128
do a second report on cannabis and

1151
00:51:06,059 --> 00:51:11,039
I could call a single-payer

1152
00:51:08,128 --> 00:51:14,038
medicare-for-all just health to the

1153
00:51:11,039 --> 00:51:16,289
human right of health and because they

1154
00:51:14,039 --> 00:51:18,329
we always talk about this stuff oh if

1155
00:51:16,289 --> 00:51:19,649
you you're taking pharmaceuticals then

1156
00:51:18,329 --> 00:51:21,298
you start taking cannabis and you take

1157
00:51:19,648 --> 00:51:24,328
less pharmaceutical as well I think

1158
00:51:21,298 --> 00:51:26,278
that's true and you hear in states where

1159
00:51:24,329 --> 00:51:28,199
there is medical cannabis laws is less

1160
00:51:26,278 --> 00:51:30,898
overdoses from opiates and so forth it

1161
00:51:28,199 --> 00:51:32,579
goes down a certain number well okay and

1162
00:51:30,898 --> 00:51:34,228
you hear some click conflicting reports

1163
00:51:32,579 --> 00:51:37,109
about that but let's assume you we can

1164
00:51:34,228 --> 00:51:39,239
arrive at a number well if it's 25% less

1165
00:51:37,108 --> 00:51:41,728
well how much does that mean in a state

1166
00:51:39,239 --> 00:51:43,588
that you save on funeral costs well and

1167
00:51:41,728 --> 00:51:45,268
then just add all the numbers up in

1168
00:51:43,588 --> 00:51:47,219
terms of well if you're buying less you

1169
00:51:45,268 --> 00:51:49,348
know what would it really mean to have

1170
00:51:47,219 --> 00:51:51,568
cannabis integrated into a healthcare

1171
00:51:49,349 --> 00:51:53,219
system I mean Bernie Sanders has said

1172
00:51:51,568 --> 00:51:54,478
that he's open to the idea that it

1173
00:51:53,219 --> 00:51:56,159
should be covered in insurance I'm not

1174
00:51:54,478 --> 00:51:58,048
here to promote a cow okay I'm in at

1175
00:51:56,159 --> 00:51:59,398
love Bernie but it's that that's but you

1176
00:51:58,048 --> 00:52:02,159
know that this is now being discussed

1177
00:51:59,398 --> 00:52:05,118
beyond our little circles in ways that

1178
00:52:02,159 --> 00:52:07,949
uh people who are good minded and have

1179
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:09,509
influence it and may actually be

1180
00:52:07,949 --> 00:52:11,278
steering the ship to some degree

1181
00:52:09,509 --> 00:52:13,048
although I think shudder to think if

1182
00:52:11,278 --> 00:52:15,688
they can empower how difficult will be

1183
00:52:13,048 --> 00:52:17,159
for them but so that's that's some of

1184
00:52:15,688 --> 00:52:19,048
the thoughts that we had that we'd like

1185
00:52:17,159 --> 00:52:21,719
to do with projects even pushing it

1186
00:52:19,048 --> 00:52:23,878
beyond just the individual healing which

1187
00:52:21,719 --> 00:52:26,128
is paramount and in the ultimate of

1188
00:52:23,878 --> 00:52:27,688
course but to just try to take it to

1189
00:52:26,128 --> 00:52:29,639
another level because it might be one of

1190
00:52:27,688 --> 00:52:31,588
those transformative moments as it was

1191
00:52:29,639 --> 00:52:33,568
ten years ago when we're all sitting

1192
00:52:31,588 --> 00:52:35,518
around kind of just you know smoking

1193
00:52:33,568 --> 00:52:37,108
weed and say well what where we at oh

1194
00:52:35,518 --> 00:52:38,668
we're gonna we're gonna just let loose

1195
00:52:37,108 --> 00:52:41,688
some energies and see what happened oh

1196
00:52:38,668 --> 00:52:41,688
my and here we are

1197
00:52:46,369 --> 00:52:50,759
so I'm going to take it in a slightly

1198
00:52:48,750 --> 00:52:53,219
different direction I'm Zoe

1199
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:56,580
I work with Martin with project CBD I'm

1200
00:52:53,219 --> 00:52:58,349
work I'm yeah I do a lot of things but

1201
00:52:56,579 --> 00:53:01,769
I've been thinking a lot about the

1202
00:52:58,349 --> 00:53:03,599
question of Education the way the last

1203
00:53:01,769 --> 00:53:04,860
thing I did before this was I was the

1204
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:07,110
director of education at a dispensary

1205
00:53:04,860 --> 00:53:09,090
and so there's been a lot of talk about

1206
00:53:07,110 --> 00:53:11,010
education over the past few days and

1207
00:53:09,090 --> 00:53:12,990
over the past several years in the

1208
00:53:11,010 --> 00:53:14,610
cannabis community and the question

1209
00:53:12,989 --> 00:53:16,979
really is like what do we mean by

1210
00:53:14,610 --> 00:53:18,360
education and who are we educating so

1211
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:20,400
there's all sorts of different answers

1212
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:22,920
to this question you can be educating

1213
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:24,900
consumers directly you can be educating

1214
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:26,700
a business owners who are trying to open

1215
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:28,110
cannabis businesses you can be educating

1216
00:53:26,699 --> 00:53:30,149
bud tenders you could be educating

1217
00:53:28,110 --> 00:53:31,800
doctors you could be educating policy

1218
00:53:30,150 --> 00:53:35,190
makers and each one of those groups

1219
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:37,620
requires a different strategy for

1220
00:53:35,190 --> 00:53:39,320
education and and so I don't think that

1221
00:53:37,619 --> 00:53:42,299
there's a way to like answer how to

1222
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:43,950
educate each one of those groups in in

1223
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:46,620
five minutes but just know that like

1224
00:53:43,949 --> 00:53:48,359
there isn't a single strategy that is

1225
00:53:46,619 --> 00:53:50,789
going to convince all of those different

1226
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:53,910
people that cannabis is is a medicine

1227
00:53:50,789 --> 00:53:56,550
and it should be treated like like a

1228
00:53:53,909 --> 00:53:58,980
medicine I think one of the things I

1229
00:53:56,550 --> 00:54:00,930
really wanted to share from my

1230
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:02,610
experiences in this field and this is

1231
00:54:00,929 --> 00:54:05,489
maybe a little bit against the grain in

1232
00:54:02,610 --> 00:54:08,370
this room is um don't be afraid to admit

1233
00:54:05,489 --> 00:54:11,159
when you don't know I got to where I am

1234
00:54:08,369 --> 00:54:14,339
by working with patients and reading all

1235
00:54:11,159 --> 00:54:16,349
the research and saying okay I don't

1236
00:54:14,340 --> 00:54:18,180
know anything about science let's read

1237
00:54:16,349 --> 00:54:20,610
this paper together like this was done

1238
00:54:18,179 --> 00:54:23,190
on mice this is different than humans we

1239
00:54:20,610 --> 00:54:25,500
don't know if this is gonna help you we

1240
00:54:23,190 --> 00:54:27,269
don't know what the dosage is this is

1241
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:28,949
how you're gonna approach it so many

1242
00:54:27,269 --> 00:54:31,369
people who come in who talk to you who

1243
00:54:28,949 --> 00:54:34,199
talk to all of you are like I'm dying

1244
00:54:31,369 --> 00:54:36,480
help me like that puts you in a really

1245
00:54:34,199 --> 00:54:37,919
difficult position it's also in a legal

1246
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:39,750
position by the way to give medical

1247
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:42,090
advice to someone without a medical

1248
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:44,420
license not that anyone's enforcing that

1249
00:54:42,090 --> 00:54:50,730
but just so you're aware it is illegal

1250
00:54:44,420 --> 00:54:53,269
and the way to like help them and to

1251
00:54:50,730 --> 00:54:55,590
help change the industry is to try and

1252
00:54:53,269 --> 00:54:58,050
provide what information is available

1253
00:54:55,590 --> 00:55:01,320
like you can provide anecdotes for

1254
00:54:58,050 --> 00:55:03,420
sure like this helped me in this way you

1255
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:05,130
know what Valerie was saying earlier

1256
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:07,200
that is a story that she can share

1257
00:55:05,130 --> 00:55:08,700
because that was her experience that

1258
00:55:07,199 --> 00:55:10,289
does not mean that someone else with

1259
00:55:08,699 --> 00:55:12,029
cancer will have that same experience

1260
00:55:10,289 --> 00:55:15,960
even if it's the same same type of

1261
00:55:12,030 --> 00:55:17,910
cancer and I think that anyway

1262
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:20,909
I'll get off onto a sidetrack but anyway

1263
00:55:17,909 --> 00:55:22,589
be familiar with the literature don't be

1264
00:55:20,909 --> 00:55:24,449
afraid to say that you don't know don't

1265
00:55:22,590 --> 00:55:26,460
be afraid to do the research I think

1266
00:55:24,449 --> 00:55:30,689
that it does much more harm to say oh

1267
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:32,460
you take take 15 milligrams of this for

1268
00:55:30,690 --> 00:55:33,929
two months and you'll get better because

1269
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:36,059
what if they don't get better what if

1270
00:55:33,929 --> 00:55:37,289
they have a really bad experience then

1271
00:55:36,059 --> 00:55:38,909
they're gonna tell all of their friends

1272
00:55:37,289 --> 00:55:40,259
that they had a bad experience with

1273
00:55:38,909 --> 00:55:42,000
canvas and none of their friends are

1274
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:44,070
gonna have like try it and this is

1275
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:46,199
exactly the opposite of what we want to

1276
00:55:44,070 --> 00:55:48,240
happen and the same is true when working

1277
00:55:46,199 --> 00:55:50,639
with medical professionals I have been

1278
00:55:48,239 --> 00:55:52,139
working with some a group of doctors at

1279
00:55:50,639 --> 00:55:54,629
Oregon Health and Sciences University

1280
00:55:52,139 --> 00:55:57,779
for a couple of years now and they're

1281
00:55:54,630 --> 00:55:59,730
highly skeptical of cannabis and I can't

1282
00:55:57,780 --> 00:56:01,470
come in and say like this is awesome

1283
00:55:59,730 --> 00:56:03,269
this will cure everything I have to be

1284
00:56:01,469 --> 00:56:05,399
incredibly familiar with the like

1285
00:56:03,269 --> 00:56:08,460
absolute cutting edge data and come in

1286
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:11,340
armed with papers and be like okay you

1287
00:56:08,460 --> 00:56:13,019
don't trust this let's go over these

1288
00:56:11,340 --> 00:56:14,850
studies together because that's how

1289
00:56:13,019 --> 00:56:16,500
you're gonna change their mind so you

1290
00:56:14,849 --> 00:56:17,909
have to figure out like what are the

1291
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:21,389
access points for the different groups

1292
00:56:17,909 --> 00:56:25,250
that you're trying to educate and do

1293
00:56:21,389 --> 00:56:27,869
that work because I think that the the

1294
00:56:25,250 --> 00:56:29,940
impetus is to be like this is amazing it

1295
00:56:27,869 --> 00:56:32,730
can cure all of these things and while

1296
00:56:29,940 --> 00:56:34,320
that it has helped a lot of people

1297
00:56:32,730 --> 00:56:36,269
different people with a lot of different

1298
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:38,340
conditions it won't help everyone with

1299
00:56:36,269 --> 00:56:42,320
that condition so I think that's like

1300
00:56:38,340 --> 00:56:44,880
the biggest takeaway in this moment

1301
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:48,000
you're talking about this these papers

1302
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:51,030
and and maybe studies do you have a

1303
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:52,920
point on your website or a way that we

1304
00:56:51,030 --> 00:56:54,900
can get in touch with you so that we can

1305
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:57,000
make these papers available to the whole

1306
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:59,039
collective yeah so there's the

1307
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:01,739
conditions page on our website if you go

1308
00:56:59,039 --> 00:57:04,139
to the homepage I think it says CBD for

1309
00:57:01,739 --> 00:57:06,959
and each one of those conditions should

1310
00:57:04,139 --> 00:57:09,179
have a section of papers that are

1311
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:10,780
related to the study of cannabis in that

1312
00:57:09,179 --> 00:57:12,819
particular condition

1313
00:57:10,780 --> 00:57:14,320
personally I also have a research

1314
00:57:12,820 --> 00:57:16,300
library that's a little bit more

1315
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:22,930
extensive that should go on the website

1316
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:25,660
one day but if you have questions I have

1317
00:57:22,929 --> 00:57:28,089
a little bit more in my personal store

1318
00:57:25,659 --> 00:57:29,460
so my email is Zoe at Project CBD org so

1319
00:57:28,090 --> 00:57:33,850
feel free to reach out if you have

1320
00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:36,550
specific questions also I just wanted to

1321
00:57:33,849 --> 00:57:38,199
say to encourage everybody you know here

1322
00:57:36,550 --> 00:57:42,550
we are we're hitting we're hitting that

1323
00:57:38,199 --> 00:57:45,069
that conversation of data so we have the

1324
00:57:42,550 --> 00:57:46,420
ability to start collecting data this is

1325
00:57:45,070 --> 00:57:49,480
something that we're going to continue

1326
00:57:46,420 --> 00:57:51,970
talking about how can we bigger our own

1327
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:54,900
library by reaching out to collective

1328
00:57:51,969 --> 00:58:00,879
members and other community members and

1329
00:57:54,900 --> 00:58:02,920
nisha I would also like to make our

1330
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:08,470
website have all those - the purifiers

1331
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:10,570
website hi everyone

1332
00:58:08,469 --> 00:58:12,219
for those of you whom I haven't had the

1333
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:15,130
pleasure of meeting my name is Nisha

1334
00:58:12,219 --> 00:58:17,589
Whitely and have the pleasure of working

1335
00:58:15,130 --> 00:58:19,119
with dr. Ethan Russo will be working

1336
00:58:17,590 --> 00:58:24,519
with Dale hunt as well

1337
00:58:19,119 --> 00:58:27,159
and be happy to send you a paper that

1338
00:58:24,519 --> 00:58:30,509
Ethan wrote with dr. Carolyn McCallum

1339
00:58:27,159 --> 00:58:33,369
from British Columbia which is the first

1340
00:58:30,510 --> 00:58:36,700
dosing article that has been published

1341
00:58:33,369 --> 00:58:39,489
in a peer-reviewed medical journal it is

1342
00:58:36,699 --> 00:58:42,849
a fantastic resource that would help all

1343
00:58:39,489 --> 00:58:45,339
of you in helping your community so I'll

1344
00:58:42,849 --> 00:58:58,480
get that to you if you guys want to send

1345
00:58:45,340 --> 00:58:59,500
that out to everyone this isn't gonna be

1346
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:04,090
five minutes

1347
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:07,030
I was asked asked to talk about things

1348
00:59:04,090 --> 00:59:09,340
to avoid in preparations and this really

1349
00:59:07,030 --> 00:59:12,519
a short conversation it's not a problem

1350
00:59:09,340 --> 00:59:15,000
with cannabis components in general

1351
00:59:12,519 --> 00:59:18,570
because there's almost nothing in there

1352
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:22,900
that's dangerous at conventional doses

1353
00:59:18,570 --> 00:59:24,640
flatout statement I can defend I have to

1354
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:27,338
think very hard

1355
00:59:24,639 --> 00:59:31,179
to come up with things that you should

1356
00:59:27,338 --> 00:59:34,920
avoid in the plant proper CBD as we've

1357
00:59:31,179 --> 00:59:38,348
heard about an incredibly versatile

1358
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:40,809
compound 30 different mechanisms of

1359
00:59:38,349 --> 00:59:43,479
action and yet all of them are

1360
00:59:40,809 --> 00:59:46,180
beneficial it's hard to figure a

1361
00:59:43,478 --> 00:59:49,498
side-effect of CBD unless you're talking

1362
00:59:46,179 --> 00:59:53,710
about a pure preparation at phenomenal

1363
00:59:49,498 --> 00:59:56,528
doses there is nothing that CBD does

1364
00:59:53,710 --> 01:00:04,778
that won't be better with at least a

1365
00:59:56,528 --> 01:00:07,088
touch of THC and and again this is the

1366
01:00:04,778 --> 01:00:10,449
antithesis of the way drugs

1367
01:00:07,088 --> 01:00:12,909
pharmaceuticals are made normally the

1368
01:00:10,449 --> 01:00:15,368
process is oh we know the receptor we're

1369
01:00:12,909 --> 01:00:17,558
gonna computer design a molecule that

1370
01:00:15,369 --> 01:00:20,170
lodges there with the highest potency

1371
01:00:17,559 --> 01:00:21,910
and the highest affinity we'll spend a

1372
01:00:20,170 --> 01:00:24,278
few hundred million dollars and then

1373
01:00:21,909 --> 01:00:26,998
seven years out we'll find out that it

1374
01:00:24,278 --> 01:00:29,318
kills your liver kills your bone marrow

1375
01:00:26,998 --> 01:00:32,618
here we're dealing with something that's

1376
01:00:29,318 --> 01:00:36,400
thousands of years old and this had this

1377
01:00:32,619 --> 01:00:39,818
interchange with humanity for better or

1378
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:43,028
for worse our bodies know how to handle

1379
01:00:39,818 --> 01:00:47,318
this medicine ah there is one component

1380
01:00:43,028 --> 01:00:50,318
a terpenoid in when i wrote about this

1381
01:00:47,318 --> 01:00:54,849
in 2001 withdrawing McPartland we listed

1382
01:00:50,318 --> 01:00:58,119
pilla joan as one of the agents one of

1383
01:00:54,849 --> 01:01:00,249
the terpenoids in cannabis it is

1384
01:00:58,119 --> 01:01:02,999
potentially toxic it can have an

1385
01:01:00,248 --> 01:01:05,858
abortifacient of fact that high doses it

1386
01:01:02,998 --> 01:01:08,828
is in pennyroyal and pennyroyal is

1387
01:01:05,858 --> 01:01:13,598
something to avoid him in pregnancy but

1388
01:01:08,829 --> 01:01:15,880
I have not seen that agent in any of the

1389
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:18,519
analyses I've seen over the last 10

1390
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:21,130
years it would be something to look out

1391
01:01:18,518 --> 01:01:22,959
for chances are it would be in such a

1392
01:01:21,130 --> 01:01:27,430
trace amount that it would have no

1393
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:32,199
relevance so again this plant is very

1394
01:01:27,429 --> 01:01:35,048
safe but how we use it may not be I am

1395
01:01:32,199 --> 01:01:38,159
fond of saying outside of primary

1396
01:01:35,048 --> 01:01:41,219
treatment of cancer where big doses are

1397
01:01:38,159 --> 01:01:45,239
and necessary that for most medical

1398
01:01:41,219 --> 01:01:48,469
conditions 15 milligrams of THC is

1399
01:01:45,239 --> 01:01:51,349
usually enough to treat any condition in

1400
01:01:48,469 --> 01:01:54,689
conjunction with a whole plant medicine

1401
01:01:51,349 --> 01:01:56,759
30 at the outside beyond that you're

1402
01:01:54,690 --> 01:01:59,070
usually dealing with more side effects

1403
01:01:56,760 --> 01:02:01,590
than benefits someone who doesn't

1404
01:01:59,070 --> 01:02:04,260
respond at that level is unlikely to

1405
01:02:01,590 --> 01:02:07,110
gain a lot of benefit at a higher dose

1406
01:02:04,260 --> 01:02:10,860
on we have to take into account things

1407
01:02:07,110 --> 01:02:14,880
like tolerance and everything else but

1408
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:17,039
in general that's a safe place to be

1409
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:20,670
the problem really comes in in

1410
01:02:17,039 --> 01:02:23,159
extractions we heard mention of Rick

1411
01:02:20,670 --> 01:02:26,760
Simpson oil that's a term I like to

1412
01:02:23,159 --> 01:02:30,269
avoid because Rick Simpson is not a

1413
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:33,570
professional he developed an extraction

1414
01:02:30,269 --> 01:02:35,250
technique calling using naphtha naphtha

1415
01:02:33,570 --> 01:02:38,519
actually isn't one thing it's a

1416
01:02:35,250 --> 01:02:42,030
petroleum distillate but there is no way

1417
01:02:38,519 --> 01:02:46,769
to safely purge this entirely from that

1418
01:02:42,030 --> 01:02:49,800
kind of extraction and I

1419
01:02:46,769 --> 01:02:51,480
I don't like butene either it's true

1420
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:54,450
it's more efficient at getting some

1421
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:56,400
things out but in the best of all

1422
01:02:54,449 --> 01:02:59,759
possible worlds where there's plenty of

1423
01:02:56,400 --> 01:03:01,980
base material we always need to be going

1424
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:04,380
for quality rather than quantity and if

1425
01:03:01,980 --> 01:03:06,030
you it doesn't matter should not matter

1426
01:03:04,380 --> 01:03:09,300
that you're not getting every last

1427
01:03:06,030 --> 01:03:13,230
little molecule there you want the good

1428
01:03:09,300 --> 01:03:16,710
stuff in that regard the cleanest

1429
01:03:13,230 --> 01:03:20,280
extraction technique is supercritical

1430
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:23,820
co2 extraction the problem there is that

1431
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:26,730
tends to squander the important monitor

1432
01:03:23,820 --> 01:03:29,370
Pinoys so you end up with a concentrate

1433
01:03:26,730 --> 01:03:33,480
that's very rich in cannabinoids at the

1434
01:03:29,369 --> 01:03:35,699
expense of the terpenoids and I think

1435
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:38,219
that this is a problem because of that

1436
01:03:35,699 --> 01:03:40,109
as a simple extraction I prefer an

1437
01:03:38,219 --> 01:03:43,289
oil-based extraction like we've heard

1438
01:03:40,110 --> 01:03:46,220
about coconut oil olive oil or a

1439
01:03:43,289 --> 01:03:49,739
particularly cold ethanol extraction

1440
01:03:46,219 --> 01:03:51,789
really will tend to do a better job in

1441
01:03:49,739 --> 01:03:53,819
getting material out

1442
01:03:51,789 --> 01:03:56,769
and then as we've heard yesterday

1443
01:03:53,820 --> 01:03:58,470
solvent less extraction some of the

1444
01:03:56,769 --> 01:04:03,489
old-style

1445
01:03:58,469 --> 01:04:05,799
techniques of making hash with Civic

1446
01:04:03,489 --> 01:04:08,319
technique a done on high-quality

1447
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:12,160
material is possible to get a

1448
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:16,470
concentration of like 62% THC

1449
01:04:12,159 --> 01:04:20,190
plus other stuff one doesn't need

1450
01:04:16,469 --> 01:04:25,750
ninety-five percent THC such as in dabs

1451
01:04:20,190 --> 01:04:29,079
that that is not a medical product that

1452
01:04:25,750 --> 01:04:34,420
is a product that's a product for going

1453
01:04:29,079 --> 01:04:37,569
extra galactic yeah but that's really

1454
01:04:34,420 --> 01:04:39,670
all I wanted to say again we're dealing

1455
01:04:37,570 --> 01:04:43,150
with very safe material and if it's

1456
01:04:39,670 --> 01:04:47,460
treated with respect and a little bit of

1457
01:04:43,150 --> 01:04:47,460
applied science good things will happen

1458
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:52,170
[Applause]

1459
01:04:55,710 --> 01:05:00,849
in the industry and you've been talking

1460
01:04:58,539 --> 01:05:05,170
to all different members of the industry

1461
01:05:00,849 --> 01:05:07,329
and you know the amazing rainbow flag

1462
01:05:05,170 --> 01:05:10,360
that you're flying is getting access to

1463
01:05:07,329 --> 01:05:13,150
patients and and and helping people that

1464
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:16,180
that are ill with with this medicine how

1465
01:05:13,150 --> 01:05:18,820
is it that we as a group can support

1466
01:05:16,179 --> 01:05:23,319
your mission or other people's missions

1467
01:05:18,820 --> 01:05:26,050
that are similar to yours well Kelly

1468
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:28,030
so she mentioned that I wrote a book the

1469
01:05:26,050 --> 01:05:29,890
book has called chronic relief a guide

1470
01:05:28,030 --> 01:05:33,400
to cannabis for the terminally and

1471
01:05:29,889 --> 01:05:36,069
chronically ill and I'll create a

1472
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:38,260
passcode when I get home next week and

1473
01:05:36,070 --> 01:05:40,510
if you guys want to send it out to

1474
01:05:38,260 --> 01:05:45,880
everyone here offer it at a discount

1475
01:05:40,510 --> 01:05:49,570
it's available on Amazon and the this is

1476
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:52,570
really how I came to meet Ethan was

1477
01:05:49,570 --> 01:05:56,620
through the writing of that book and I

1478
01:05:52,570 --> 01:06:00,850
feel like a really understanding your

1479
01:05:56,619 --> 01:06:04,710
data is critical we want to be the

1480
01:06:00,849 --> 01:06:07,279
primary resources for information and it

1481
01:06:04,710 --> 01:06:09,869
important that we're giving accurate

1482
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:12,150
science-based information of course

1483
01:06:09,869 --> 01:06:15,059
where there is an absence of that we

1484
01:06:12,150 --> 01:06:17,039
have to use what we've seen work in our

1485
01:06:15,059 --> 01:06:18,869
communities and with the people that we

1486
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:22,800
support

1487
01:06:18,869 --> 01:06:26,940
so really the the goal with the website

1488
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:31,769
which is my chronic relief com is to

1489
01:06:26,940 --> 01:06:35,639
educate people who are new to the topic

1490
01:06:31,769 --> 01:06:39,599
of cannabis and I think that when people

1491
01:06:35,639 --> 01:06:42,000
really understand why and how the

1492
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:44,580
components of the cannabis plant work in

1493
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:49,760
their bodies it becomes so much less

1494
01:06:44,579 --> 01:06:53,519
scary and you know we we've seen this

1495
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:57,480
fantastic evolution in public sentiment

1496
01:06:53,519 --> 01:07:02,219
about cannabis since Sanjay Gupta did

1497
01:06:57,480 --> 01:07:05,369
his special about weed and now there's

1498
01:07:02,219 --> 01:07:08,939
CBD sold everywhere and so that's really

1499
01:07:05,369 --> 01:07:11,849
opened the conversation a much larger or

1500
01:07:08,940 --> 01:07:15,389
far more important conversation about

1501
01:07:11,849 --> 01:07:18,180
cannabis cannabis medicine how and why

1502
01:07:15,389 --> 01:07:22,739
does it work the fact that it's such a

1503
01:07:18,179 --> 01:07:28,289
safe versatile and effective component

1504
01:07:22,739 --> 01:07:30,779
when we're seeing this takeover of human

1505
01:07:28,289 --> 01:07:32,969
health from the pharmaceutical industry

1506
01:07:30,780 --> 01:07:35,220
and when you know people are consuming

1507
01:07:32,969 --> 01:07:36,799
large amounts of pharmaceuticals the

1508
01:07:35,219 --> 01:07:39,858
pharmaceuticals in and of themselves

1509
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:43,349
cause a whole bunch of other problems

1510
01:07:39,858 --> 01:07:48,088
that oddly enough cannabis helps to

1511
01:07:43,349 --> 01:07:51,119
ameliorate and so what what I endeavor

1512
01:07:48,088 --> 01:07:54,329
to do with my passion project for which

1513
01:07:51,119 --> 01:07:57,420
I make zero money is just because it's

1514
01:07:54,329 --> 01:08:00,750
the right thing to do and this is

1515
01:07:57,420 --> 01:08:03,809
through social media on on my chronic

1516
01:08:00,750 --> 01:08:06,210
relieves social sites and the work

1517
01:08:03,809 --> 01:08:10,559
through the book and any public speaking

1518
01:08:06,210 --> 01:08:13,800
engagements is just to alleviate fear

1519
01:08:10,559 --> 01:08:17,519
and the way we do that is by empowering

1520
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:18,600
people with information and helping

1521
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:22,230
people

1522
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:25,380
and their body and and how it works it's

1523
01:08:22,229 --> 01:08:27,119
unfortunate that in grade school and

1524
01:08:25,380 --> 01:08:29,640
through our education system we don't

1525
01:08:27,119 --> 01:08:32,099
have a better understanding of our

1526
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:34,350
bodies and how they work

1527
01:08:32,100 --> 01:08:37,350
you know another challenge is the fact

1528
01:08:34,350 --> 01:08:39,930
that there might be

1529
01:08:37,350 --> 01:08:42,120
Ethan what is it something like 5% of

1530
01:08:39,930 --> 01:08:44,340
medical schools actually address the

1531
01:08:42,119 --> 01:08:50,250
endocannabinoid system in medical

1532
01:08:44,340 --> 01:08:53,460
education is that right and you know

1533
01:08:50,250 --> 01:08:55,890
when we have an interaction with a

1534
01:08:53,460 --> 01:08:58,529
physician and we know more about the

1535
01:08:55,890 --> 01:09:06,500
endocannabinoid system than they do or

1536
01:08:58,529 --> 01:09:10,590
how and why cannabinoids and turpentine

1537
01:09:06,500 --> 01:09:14,250
that a little scary and sad but it's

1538
01:09:10,590 --> 01:09:17,220
also an opportunity for us as people in

1539
01:09:14,250 --> 01:09:20,760
the cannabis industry to educate and so

1540
01:09:17,220 --> 01:09:24,930
I'll really kind of sum it up and the

1541
01:09:20,760 --> 01:09:27,390
fact that it's up to us to spread the

1542
01:09:24,930 --> 01:09:29,880
word about the fact that cannabis is a

1543
01:09:27,390 --> 01:09:35,430
safe versatile and effective medicine

1544
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:38,220
and through constantly working to spread

1545
01:09:35,430 --> 01:09:40,109
just basic knowledge we don't have to

1546
01:09:38,220 --> 01:09:42,119
you know make people feel like they're

1547
01:09:40,109 --> 01:09:45,440
drinking from the fire hose of too much

1548
01:09:42,119 --> 01:09:51,420
information just a little bit of basic

1549
01:09:45,439 --> 01:09:55,949
actual fact base knowledge will empower

1550
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:57,869
them to live better die better be better

1551
01:09:55,949 --> 01:10:01,079
and so I think that you know in the

1552
01:09:57,869 --> 01:10:02,760
grand sense of regenerative farming

1553
01:10:01,079 --> 01:10:05,670
that's something that we're all

1554
01:10:02,760 --> 01:10:08,550
endeavoring to do and in everything that

1555
01:10:05,670 --> 01:10:20,579
we're doing whether that's in our

1556
01:10:08,550 --> 01:10:24,949
personal life or a professional life and

1557
01:10:20,579 --> 01:10:27,689
now Erica winters and Wendy minty

1558
01:10:24,949 --> 01:10:30,029
speaking about charitable contributions

1559
01:10:27,689 --> 01:10:33,119
outreach with cannabis and nonprofit

1560
01:10:30,029 --> 01:10:36,469
groups and creating direct lines for

1561
01:10:33,119 --> 01:10:39,539
producers to donate to patients

1562
01:10:36,470 --> 01:10:41,100
completely derail that and add one more

1563
01:10:39,539 --> 01:10:44,250
health education resource that will

1564
01:10:41,100 --> 01:10:47,340
connect both bridges how many have heard

1565
01:10:44,250 --> 01:10:52,829
of nationally registered horticultural

1566
01:10:47,340 --> 01:10:54,930
therapists in America certified

1567
01:10:52,829 --> 01:10:57,510
horticultural therapist working towards

1568
01:10:54,930 --> 01:10:59,400
national registration this is a direct

1569
01:10:57,510 --> 01:11:01,680
line into the hospitals they're taking

1570
01:10:59,399 --> 01:11:03,029
this modality seriously everyone in this

1571
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:06,030
room intuitively knows what

1572
01:11:03,029 --> 01:11:08,399
horticultural therapy is specifically

1573
01:11:06,029 --> 01:11:10,829
clinically this is a modality to achieve

1574
01:11:08,399 --> 01:11:12,509
a rainbow of therapeutic goals by using

1575
01:11:10,829 --> 01:11:15,269
nature based activities with every

1576
01:11:12,510 --> 01:11:16,920
population group on the planet hospital

1577
01:11:15,270 --> 01:11:20,250
administrators are listening to us right

1578
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:22,079
now I have been approached by several

1579
01:11:20,250 --> 01:11:23,699
administrators in the Eugene area about

1580
01:11:22,079 --> 01:11:25,979
getting horticultural therapy programs

1581
01:11:23,699 --> 01:11:27,569
involved with cannabis patients however

1582
01:11:25,979 --> 01:11:29,849
in our code of ethics we cannot make

1583
01:11:27,569 --> 01:11:32,189
medical recommendations so I need the

1584
01:11:29,850 --> 01:11:34,730
doctors the endocannabinoid experts and

1585
01:11:32,189 --> 01:11:37,250
be a liaison between the patient and

1586
01:11:34,729 --> 01:11:39,359
we're moving in a direction where

1587
01:11:37,250 --> 01:11:41,550
insurance is on the table of discussion

1588
01:11:39,359 --> 01:11:43,649
so I think this might be a direct line

1589
01:11:41,550 --> 01:11:44,970
in thought if anybody's interested in

1590
01:11:43,649 --> 01:11:46,710
learning about a certification hit me up

1591
01:11:44,970 --> 01:11:50,869
over coffee it's not easy but it's super

1592
01:11:46,710 --> 01:11:58,489
doable with that

1593
01:11:50,868 --> 01:12:00,109
I am really excited to talk about

1594
01:11:58,488 --> 01:12:02,178
charity and outrage this is one of my

1595
01:12:00,109 --> 01:12:04,579
biggest passions and Wendy and I are

1596
01:12:02,179 --> 01:12:10,579
here on behalf of women leaders in

1597
01:12:04,579 --> 01:12:12,800
cannabis a 501 C 6 in Eugene Oregon so I

1598
01:12:10,579 --> 01:12:14,960
think we all intuitively know that

1599
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:17,389
charity and giving and outreach is epic

1600
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:19,908
and we should all do it but let's be

1601
01:12:17,389 --> 01:12:21,710
honest we have to fill the water tanks

1602
01:12:19,908 --> 01:12:24,469
and pay the bills and it's a wonderful

1603
01:12:21,710 --> 01:12:30,109
vision for next year so we want to talk

1604
01:12:24,469 --> 01:12:32,630
a little bit more about the true value

1605
01:12:30,109 --> 01:12:34,359
of outreach and I believe this is so in

1606
01:12:32,630 --> 01:12:37,849
line with our mission here at pure I

1607
01:12:34,359 --> 01:12:39,529
want to start by telling a story so in a

1608
01:12:37,849 --> 01:12:42,230
different chapter of my life I

1609
01:12:39,529 --> 01:12:44,960
skateboarded competitively and wrote

1610
01:12:42,229 --> 01:12:46,848
four tactics board shop in Eugene and we

1611
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:48,408
were starting a petition to build a

1612
01:12:46,849 --> 01:12:53,389
skate park this is my first foray into

1613
01:12:48,408 --> 01:12:55,670
public policy and activism so we

1614
01:12:53,389 --> 01:12:57,349
collected signatures we met with the

1615
01:12:55,670 --> 01:12:59,810
city officials we built the damn thing

1616
01:12:57,349 --> 01:13:02,270
and it is a regional destination skate

1617
01:12:59,810 --> 01:13:04,539
park and we're very proud of it No thank

1618
01:13:02,270 --> 01:13:07,610
you thank you

1619
01:13:04,539 --> 01:13:09,229
but this naive little activist didn't

1620
01:13:07,609 --> 01:13:12,829
actually see what was also going on

1621
01:13:09,229 --> 01:13:15,109
behind the scenes so tactics is getting

1622
01:13:12,829 --> 01:13:17,769
press releases their facebook likes and

1623
01:13:15,109 --> 01:13:20,420
followers are going up they are

1624
01:13:17,770 --> 01:13:21,830
increasing local retail sales people are

1625
01:13:20,420 --> 01:13:23,389
posting their skateboards and their

1626
01:13:21,829 --> 01:13:25,250
tricks internationally they're getting

1627
01:13:23,389 --> 01:13:27,349
larger recognition and all of a sudden

1628
01:13:25,250 --> 01:13:29,630
they are one of the largest

1629
01:13:27,349 --> 01:13:32,449
international distributors for board

1630
01:13:29,630 --> 01:13:34,730
sports on the planet I love this model

1631
01:13:32,448 --> 01:13:35,928
do I believe that Matt and Bob genuinely

1632
01:13:34,729 --> 01:13:38,359
wanted that skatepark built for our

1633
01:13:35,929 --> 01:13:40,699
local skaters hell yeah and their

1634
01:13:38,359 --> 01:13:43,908
integrity and mission is what allowed

1635
01:13:40,698 --> 01:13:46,309
this project to be so successful and so

1636
01:13:43,908 --> 01:13:48,529
there are so many different avenues that

1637
01:13:46,310 --> 01:13:52,670
we could take when it comes to charity

1638
01:13:48,529 --> 01:13:55,429
and I understand deeply that this is a

1639
01:13:52,670 --> 01:13:58,250
goal for most of us and it's just a

1640
01:13:55,429 --> 01:14:00,199
matter of valuing it and understanding

1641
01:13:58,250 --> 01:14:03,618
there is a tremendous ROI to your

1642
01:14:00,198 --> 01:14:04,779
business with that I want to introduce

1643
01:14:03,618 --> 01:14:06,609
Wendy one of our

1644
01:14:04,779 --> 01:14:07,960
founding board members for women leaders

1645
01:14:06,609 --> 01:14:09,308
to talk a little bit more about how that

1646
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:17,980
could fit into your marketing strategy

1647
01:14:09,309 --> 01:14:19,900
so something with charitable outreach it

1648
01:14:17,979 --> 01:14:23,678
comes down to our social responsibility

1649
01:14:19,899 --> 01:14:27,429
as businesses in this industry and and

1650
01:14:23,679 --> 01:14:28,599
and as any industry really we are here

1651
01:14:27,429 --> 01:14:30,250
we are doing good work we're doing

1652
01:14:28,599 --> 01:14:32,559
powerful things for ourselves and for

1653
01:14:30,250 --> 01:14:34,988
our community and on the other hand what

1654
01:14:32,559 --> 01:14:36,909
responsibilities do we have to our

1655
01:14:34,988 --> 01:14:39,609
community to our partners to our allies

1656
01:14:36,908 --> 01:14:41,710
to give back and to help support them in

1657
01:14:39,609 --> 01:14:43,929
the same ways that they ultimately

1658
01:14:41,710 --> 01:14:45,189
whether they intended to or not have

1659
01:14:43,929 --> 01:14:47,770
supported us to the point where we are

1660
01:14:45,189 --> 01:14:49,359
now to be able to do this to operate to

1661
01:14:47,770 --> 01:14:51,460
pay taxes and to do it legally without

1662
01:14:49,359 --> 01:14:53,500
fear of going to jail we're in this

1663
01:14:51,460 --> 01:14:56,489
position now we have the opportunity to

1664
01:14:53,500 --> 01:14:59,349
give back and we absolutely should be

1665
01:14:56,488 --> 01:15:02,288
based on core values and mission but

1666
01:14:59,349 --> 01:15:04,420
also because it does provide a beautiful

1667
01:15:02,288 --> 01:15:06,609
opportunity to get good ROI for our

1668
01:15:04,420 --> 01:15:09,250
companies and for our businesses and

1669
01:15:06,609 --> 01:15:10,839
that can be really valuable in the

1670
01:15:09,250 --> 01:15:13,630
greater conversation like Kelly's been

1671
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:15,489
driving towards this whole conversation

1672
01:15:13,630 --> 01:15:16,809
is you know thinking about

1673
01:15:15,488 --> 01:15:18,459
internationally and thinking about

1674
01:15:16,809 --> 01:15:20,500
opening up new channels for later in the

1675
01:15:18,460 --> 01:15:22,118
future and it's something that's so

1676
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:25,210
important we really need to dig deep and

1677
01:15:22,118 --> 01:15:27,069
get creative because the reality is is

1678
01:15:25,210 --> 01:15:29,260
we're still pop farmers and a lot of

1679
01:15:27,069 --> 01:15:31,448
people are scared to work with us but we

1680
01:15:29,260 --> 01:15:36,480
can overcome that and women leaders in

1681
01:15:31,448 --> 01:15:39,368
cannabis absolutely has our very first

1682
01:15:36,479 --> 01:15:41,078
charitable goal we wanted to put

1683
01:15:39,368 --> 01:15:42,578
together like food baskets for

1684
01:15:41,078 --> 01:15:44,679
Thanksgiving and we tried to partner

1685
01:15:42,578 --> 01:15:46,960
with food for Lane County and a couple

1686
01:15:44,679 --> 01:15:48,429
different other organizations and they

1687
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:51,849
didn't want it they didn't want our

1688
01:15:48,429 --> 01:15:53,649
money they didn't want our food because

1689
01:15:51,849 --> 01:15:57,449
it came from the women leaders in

1690
01:15:53,649 --> 01:15:59,710
cannabis it's like what the fuck

1691
01:15:57,448 --> 01:16:01,328
we're here we have food we have money

1692
01:15:59,710 --> 01:16:03,250
like people are hungry what's the

1693
01:16:01,328 --> 01:16:04,929
problem well we can't say it came from

1694
01:16:03,250 --> 01:16:08,078
cannabis because we're a federally

1695
01:16:04,929 --> 01:16:10,118
funded organization exactly we offered

1696
01:16:08,078 --> 01:16:11,649
that take our name off of it here's a

1697
01:16:10,118 --> 01:16:14,319
basket of food if it shows up on your

1698
01:16:11,649 --> 01:16:16,210
doorstep are you gonna distribute it mmm

1699
01:16:14,319 --> 01:16:18,399
no that's a really hard conflict of

1700
01:16:16,210 --> 01:16:20,890
interest okay

1701
01:16:18,399 --> 01:16:21,759
we'll find somebody who will forget it

1702
01:16:20,890 --> 01:16:23,680
then

1703
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:26,890
and we fought and we looked and we found

1704
01:16:23,680 --> 01:16:29,079
people and organizations like who the

1705
01:16:26,890 --> 01:16:31,030
autism rocks came to us like we'll take

1706
01:16:29,079 --> 01:16:34,359
your money we need help

1707
01:16:31,029 --> 01:16:35,739
great let's do it and so start digging

1708
01:16:34,359 --> 01:16:37,960
deep and getting creative and finding

1709
01:16:35,739 --> 01:16:41,050
these organizations that strategically

1710
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:43,899
align with what you value in your own

1711
01:16:41,050 --> 01:16:46,029
ethics and work with them to support the

1712
01:16:43,899 --> 01:16:47,829
greater mission and it'll it'll come

1713
01:16:46,029 --> 01:16:50,170
about and I think that you know huge

1714
01:16:47,829 --> 01:16:52,420
change starts with one small step and it

1715
01:16:50,170 --> 01:16:55,119
might be a really rigorous obnoxious

1716
01:16:52,420 --> 01:16:57,069
frustrating step but once it starts you

1717
01:16:55,119 --> 01:17:06,309
keep going and it's really really

1718
01:16:57,069 --> 01:17:10,090
important this is all about mutualism

1719
01:17:06,310 --> 01:17:12,520
right so as a group it would be

1720
01:17:10,090 --> 01:17:15,250
fantastic to have later discussions to

1721
01:17:12,520 --> 01:17:17,380
define our charity scope do we just want

1722
01:17:15,250 --> 01:17:18,909
to work with patients year one and do

1723
01:17:17,380 --> 01:17:20,409
something that is manageable do we want

1724
01:17:18,909 --> 01:17:22,329
to work with established groups like

1725
01:17:20,409 --> 01:17:23,889
Hero grown who already have direct

1726
01:17:22,329 --> 01:17:26,229
distribution lines set up in place for

1727
01:17:23,890 --> 01:17:27,460
CBD so I'm really excited to get

1728
01:17:26,229 --> 01:17:30,250
together with anybody who wants to

1729
01:17:27,460 --> 01:17:31,750
discuss this further because this is

1730
01:17:30,250 --> 01:17:33,699
this is how we make the magic happen

1731
01:17:31,750 --> 01:17:35,319
together and I'm so excited to have this

1732
01:17:33,699 --> 01:17:37,899
platform to be able to reach everybody

1733
01:17:35,319 --> 01:17:42,519
who needs this medicine thank you so

1734
01:17:37,899 --> 01:17:44,199
much this is back here shoulder tapping

1735
01:17:42,520 --> 01:17:47,290
me and I appreciate it very much

1736
01:17:44,199 --> 01:17:48,489
one thing that Erica and I have been

1737
01:17:47,289 --> 01:17:51,010
really passionate about over the last

1738
01:17:48,489 --> 01:17:52,119
couple years through women leaders is

1739
01:17:51,010 --> 01:17:56,619
partnering with an organization called

1740
01:17:52,119 --> 01:17:58,510
beyond toxics they have been working so

1741
01:17:56,619 --> 01:18:01,809
hard to write some legislation and to

1742
01:17:58,510 --> 01:18:04,150
implement Oregon as a non toxic state

1743
01:18:01,810 --> 01:18:07,570
they work really heavily with the land

1744
01:18:04,149 --> 01:18:11,439
care acts about how to mitigate the use

1745
01:18:07,569 --> 01:18:14,199
of toxic pesticides in our city planning

1746
01:18:11,439 --> 01:18:18,129
and land care public land care and they

1747
01:18:14,199 --> 01:18:19,720
are making waves seriously seriously I

1748
01:18:18,130 --> 01:18:22,119
think that's a big part of this mission

1749
01:18:19,720 --> 01:18:23,740
this weekend is I think as a group we

1750
01:18:22,119 --> 01:18:24,819
really need to promote that kind of

1751
01:18:23,739 --> 01:18:27,550
stuff because really like the

1752
01:18:24,819 --> 01:18:29,949
origination of us creating this whole

1753
01:18:27,550 --> 01:18:31,600
thing was to save the world and to and

1754
01:18:29,949 --> 01:18:33,819
to be compassionate

1755
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:36,280
they're farmers and save-the-world so

1756
01:18:33,819 --> 01:18:38,349
these types of missions that's where I

1757
01:18:36,279 --> 01:18:40,420
personally and us but that's where we

1758
01:18:38,350 --> 01:18:42,310
want to put all of our energy behind and

1759
01:18:40,420 --> 01:18:43,840
behind the medicine for the people

1760
01:18:42,310 --> 01:18:45,340
because really that you'll see us at

1761
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:47,319
Emerald couple have two teepees and

1762
01:18:45,340 --> 01:18:50,440
everyone else will have all this you

1763
01:18:47,319 --> 01:18:51,609
know vinyl signs and crazy marketing and

1764
01:18:50,439 --> 01:18:58,809
stuff but it's just the roots that

1765
01:18:51,609 --> 01:19:01,149
really matters to us so this is the

1766
01:18:58,810 --> 01:19:04,810
coolest thing as the standards that are

1767
01:19:01,149 --> 01:19:07,119
set for care for cannabis are not set

1768
01:19:04,810 --> 01:19:10,270
anywhere else yeah and and their whole

1769
01:19:07,119 --> 01:19:12,399
thing is it is safer for kids to come

1770
01:19:10,270 --> 01:19:13,780
running through our cannabis farms than

1771
01:19:12,399 --> 01:19:17,229
it is for their kids to go run through

1772
01:19:13,779 --> 01:19:20,019
city parks and it's so true and so we

1773
01:19:17,229 --> 01:19:22,719
have a voice now to say that this is

1774
01:19:20,020 --> 01:19:25,810
possible organics regenerative practices

1775
01:19:22,720 --> 01:19:27,610
are possible in any avenue that we want

1776
01:19:25,810 --> 01:19:29,890
them to be and we just need to help

1777
01:19:27,609 --> 01:19:32,349
people understand that that's beautiful

1778
01:19:29,890 --> 01:19:34,329
and and we're bumping up against so many

1779
01:19:32,350 --> 01:19:35,829
hard things all over the place so I

1780
01:19:34,329 --> 01:19:37,840
think you know being able to find where

1781
01:19:35,829 --> 01:19:41,890
we can move around is just as a better

1782
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:43,690
thing so we're gonna turn it over to Sky

1783
01:19:41,890 --> 01:19:46,480
and Sierra and they're gonna talk about

1784
01:19:43,689 --> 01:19:49,000
their mission with athletes and what

1785
01:19:46,479 --> 01:19:51,269
they're finding and they're touring the

1786
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:55,810
world with athletes and I'm how our

1787
01:19:51,270 --> 01:20:00,750
group could maybe help you all hi my

1788
01:19:55,810 --> 01:20:04,020
name is sky my partner - Sierra hi and I

1789
01:20:00,750 --> 01:20:08,199

01:20:04,020 --> 01:20:11,950
pacifically downhill I go to New Zealand

1791
01:20:08,199 --> 01:20:14,470
and all over the place and find that

1792
01:20:11,949 --> 01:20:16,149
within the athlete's world and mountain

1793
01:20:14,470 --> 01:20:18,909
biking there's a lot of fun health

1794
01:20:16,149 --> 01:20:21,609
there's a lot of people kind of going to

1795
01:20:18,909 --> 01:20:23,470
races and have a healthy side to them

1796
01:20:21,609 --> 01:20:26,139
and have a good side but there's just a

1797
01:20:23,470 --> 01:20:29,020
lot of music communications and what is

1798
01:20:26,140 --> 01:20:33,869
actually good and just kind of what you

1799
01:20:29,020 --> 01:20:33,870
actually should be taking in with

1800
01:20:34,279 --> 01:20:39,859
a lot of health products which are

1801
01:20:36,890 --> 01:20:43,579
really unhealthy are in the athlete

1802
01:20:39,859 --> 01:20:45,889
market today and all of the nutrition

1803
01:20:43,579 --> 01:20:48,198
that put forward by professional

1804
01:20:45,890 --> 01:20:51,079
athletes is actually really unhealthy

1805
01:20:48,198 --> 01:20:53,479
and we're working towards getting

1806
01:20:51,079 --> 01:20:56,210
medicine that can actually help these

1807
01:20:53,479 --> 01:20:58,339
athletes in a way that's gonna make them

1808
01:20:56,210 --> 01:21:00,079
healthy and able to perform when they

1809
01:20:58,340 --> 01:21:02,750
have injuries that need to be competing

1810
01:21:00,079 --> 01:21:04,159
the next week rather than taking

1811
01:21:02,750 --> 01:21:06,198
something that might sustain them for

1812
01:21:04,159 --> 01:21:08,539
that week but they'll be down the next

1813
01:21:06,198 --> 01:21:11,210
so we're trying to get something that is

1814
01:21:08,539 --> 01:21:13,100
testing across the boards low enough

1815
01:21:11,210 --> 01:21:15,980
that athletes don't have to be worried

1816
01:21:13,100 --> 01:21:17,539
about coming up hot or having issues

1817
01:21:15,979 --> 01:21:21,129
because that's the biggest fear with

1818
01:21:17,539 --> 01:21:23,420
cannabis and athletes right now CBD is

1819
01:21:21,130 --> 01:21:24,710
something that is not really talked

1820
01:21:23,420 --> 01:21:28,369
about within the mountain biking

1821
01:21:24,710 --> 01:21:32,060
community it was actually just opened up

1822
01:21:28,369 --> 01:21:34,460
by the UCI which is a Federation that is

1823
01:21:32,060 --> 01:21:37,730
in France and basically runs all

1824
01:21:34,460 --> 01:21:41,270
mountain biking and any biking industry

1825
01:21:37,729 --> 01:21:43,309
of any sort they have made THC and CBD

1826
01:21:41,270 --> 01:21:47,900
and all these cannabinoids totally

1827
01:21:43,310 --> 01:21:49,880
illegal to use by any athletes and it

1828
01:21:47,899 --> 01:21:51,889
just makes it a little bit harder to be

1829
01:21:49,880 --> 01:21:55,279
able to go around and do your everyday

1830
01:21:51,890 --> 01:21:59,090
sport without having the support of the

1831
01:21:55,279 --> 01:22:01,309
plants around you even beyond the CBD

1832
01:21:59,090 --> 01:22:03,800
side we also want to open up all the

1833
01:22:01,310 --> 01:22:05,810
herbs that we have access to and all the

1834
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:09,140
amazing medicinal compounds with those

1835
01:22:05,810 --> 01:22:12,380
and just open up a discussion with CBD

1836
01:22:09,140 --> 01:22:15,320
and natural resources with that the

1837
01:22:12,380 --> 01:22:17,930
earth has to offer us and just kind of

1838
01:22:15,319 --> 01:22:20,960
going back in time and going back

1839
01:22:17,930 --> 01:22:23,619
hundreds of centuries back to where our

1840
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:25,850
roots have always been to create a

1841
01:22:23,619 --> 01:22:27,529
ultimate health because within the

1842
01:22:25,850 --> 01:22:30,110
mountain biking and within all these

1843
01:22:27,529 --> 01:22:32,840
industries there's a lot of energy

1844
01:22:30,109 --> 01:22:35,238
drinks and all that that really don't

1845
01:22:32,840 --> 01:22:37,100
give you that good of a feeling I mean

1846
01:22:35,238 --> 01:22:39,379
they might give you some energy but

1847
01:22:37,100 --> 01:22:44,570
let's be honest it's not a good way to

1848
01:22:39,380 --> 01:22:47,300
sustain your athletic abilities yeah

1849
01:22:44,569 --> 01:22:48,049
just trying to create a discussion of

1850
01:22:47,300 --> 01:22:51,079
health and career

1851
01:22:48,050 --> 01:22:53,270
an option and a place for people to come

1852
01:22:51,079 --> 01:22:56,779
to to be able to get all the information

1853
01:22:53,270 --> 01:22:59,030
that they need and all the products that

1854
01:22:56,779 --> 01:23:00,259
they need as well because when it comes

1855
01:22:59,029 --> 01:23:04,880
down to it people don't know what to

1856
01:23:00,260 --> 01:23:08,180
look for so I also want to say that

1857
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:12,440
athletes always are inspiration to kids

1858
01:23:08,180 --> 01:23:15,050
and kids look up to athletes it forever

1859
01:23:12,439 --> 01:23:17,299
so it'd be really great if we can have

1860
01:23:15,050 --> 01:23:19,279
some health and wellness to help propel

1861
01:23:17,300 --> 01:23:21,199
those athletes so that our children who

1862
01:23:19,279 --> 01:23:24,139
are in regular school systems can be

1863
01:23:21,199 --> 01:23:27,179
seeing that and that's something I'd

1864
01:23:24,140 --> 01:23:33,829
really like to see we're working for it

1865
01:23:27,180 --> 01:23:33,829
[Applause]

1866
01:23:35,260 --> 01:23:41,329
so I think our last speaker for this

1867
01:23:38,090 --> 01:23:45,680
session is going to be Zoe again is

1868
01:23:41,329 --> 01:23:47,750
going to speak about the CBD new FDA

1869
01:23:45,680 --> 01:23:51,170
regulations and claims how to navigate

1870
01:23:47,750 --> 01:23:54,020
the market and keep your CBD products on

1871
01:23:51,170 --> 01:24:01,039
the market super easy topic to talk

1872
01:23:54,020 --> 01:24:03,220
about yeah cool cool I'm gonna start

1873
01:24:01,039 --> 01:24:07,729
this whole thing with I'm not a lawyer

1874
01:24:03,220 --> 01:24:11,900
so this is not legal advice so that

1875
01:24:07,729 --> 01:24:13,909
being said I have read all of the FDA

1876
01:24:11,899 --> 01:24:15,679
regulations I testified in front of the

1877
01:24:13,909 --> 01:24:18,050
FDA about CBD and cannabis regulation in

1878
01:24:15,680 --> 01:24:20,900
May we submitted 300 pages of comments

1879
01:24:18,050 --> 01:24:23,210
to the FDA about regulating CBD and

1880
01:24:20,899 --> 01:24:25,009
cannabis and then you know two weeks ago

1881
01:24:23,210 --> 01:24:27,529
they came out and they said it is

1882
01:24:25,010 --> 01:24:31,640
illegal to put CBD in food

1883
01:24:27,529 --> 01:24:34,519
you can't label anything any CBD product

1884
01:24:31,640 --> 01:24:36,470
as a supplement and they don't think

1885
01:24:34,520 --> 01:24:48,560
that it's safe for human or animal

1886
01:24:36,470 --> 01:24:50,150
consumption so yeah that's fun yeah so

1887
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:53,120
so enforcement of that is gonna be an

1888
01:24:50,149 --> 01:24:54,889
issue I think that that's maybe in all

1889
01:24:53,119 --> 01:24:59,809
of our benefits cuz you know this

1890
01:24:54,890 --> 01:25:01,960
industry is massive and only going to

1891
01:24:59,810 --> 01:25:03,969
get bigger but I

1892
01:25:01,960 --> 01:25:06,010
I think it's anyone's guess as to what's

1893
01:25:03,969 --> 01:25:08,890
actually gonna happen in in the legal

1894
01:25:06,010 --> 01:25:10,329
side of things if the DA decides that

1895
01:25:08,890 --> 01:25:15,730
they're gonna go after everyone I mean

1896
01:25:10,329 --> 01:25:17,949
like they could are they probably not

1897
01:25:15,729 --> 01:25:19,718
I'm not sure I mean like we're in a

1898
01:25:17,949 --> 01:25:21,550
moment of deep uncertainty so the

1899
01:25:19,719 --> 01:25:25,060
question really is like what do we do

1900
01:25:21,550 --> 01:25:27,159
from here and I think the answer is like

1901
01:25:25,060 --> 01:25:28,900
as much as it sucks and all of us in

1902
01:25:27,159 --> 01:25:30,399
this room don't actually believe that it

1903
01:25:28,899 --> 01:25:32,319
will work is reach out to your Congress

1904
01:25:30,399 --> 01:25:34,149
people make sure that your legislators

1905
01:25:32,319 --> 01:25:36,909
are actually educated about cannabis I

1906
01:25:34,149 --> 01:25:39,339
mean like when I was talking to the pack

1907
01:25:36,909 --> 01:25:40,539
in Portland that some of my friends are

1908
01:25:39,340 --> 01:25:42,250
involved in and I heard what they were

1909
01:25:40,539 --> 01:25:43,359
like I can't afford to go to DC you

1910
01:25:42,250 --> 01:25:44,529
don't do that whole thing but I heard

1911
01:25:43,359 --> 01:25:46,389
what they were talking about when they

1912
01:25:44,529 --> 01:25:48,099
went to DC and it was only the banking

1913
01:25:46,390 --> 01:25:50,289
act is the only thing they were talking

1914
01:25:48,100 --> 01:25:53,739
about to legislators in DC and it's like

1915
01:25:50,289 --> 01:25:55,719
that's awesome super important we also

1916
01:25:53,738 --> 01:25:57,699
need to be talking about how to put

1917
01:25:55,719 --> 01:26:00,730
pressure on the FDA to regulate CBD and

1918
01:25:57,699 --> 01:26:02,409
cannabis in a way that makes sense so

1919
01:26:00,729 --> 01:26:03,879
one of the things that I did and

1920
01:26:02,409 --> 01:26:07,689
actually was talking to Eleanor the

1921
01:26:03,880 --> 01:26:11,489
other day which she should probably also

1922
01:26:07,689 --> 01:26:15,369
be involved in this conversation was

1923
01:26:11,488 --> 01:26:17,889
read all of not all of but a lot of data

1924
01:26:15,369 --> 01:26:21,840
and information about how Herbalife sins

1925
01:26:17,890 --> 01:26:24,880
are regulated globally and so currently

1926
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:31,000
man how to do this in five minutes the

1927
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:33,609
FDA regulates okay the FDA regulates

1928
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:35,859
food and drugs and those are the two

1929
01:26:33,609 --> 01:26:38,319
categories that there are regulatory

1930
01:26:35,859 --> 01:26:41,469
structures for so drugs are

1931
01:26:38,319 --> 01:26:44,199
pharmaceutical drugs they have like the

1932
01:26:41,469 --> 01:26:45,730
whole pharmaceutical process every drug

1933
01:26:44,199 --> 01:26:49,988
has to go through clinical trials show

1934
01:26:45,729 --> 01:26:51,819
efficacy theoretically and food is its

1935
01:26:49,988 --> 01:26:54,069
own category there's all these sort of

1936
01:26:51,819 --> 01:26:56,319
safety and quality issues that come up

1937
01:26:54,069 --> 01:26:59,979
with food supplements are considered a

1938
01:26:56,319 --> 01:27:04,599
subcategory of food and the supplement

1939
01:26:59,979 --> 01:27:07,419
industry is deeply problematic in my

1940
01:27:04,600 --> 01:27:12,370
opinion the regulations governing

1941
01:27:07,420 --> 01:27:15,159
supplements are minimal and I think a

1942
01:27:12,369 --> 01:27:15,729
lot of people a lot of like corporate

1943
01:27:15,159 --> 01:27:18,220
players

1944
01:27:15,729 --> 01:27:20,229
in this scene would love to see cannabis

1945
01:27:18,220 --> 01:27:22,690
regulated as a supplement and

1946
01:27:20,229 --> 01:27:24,459
unfortunately I like don't agree with

1947
01:27:22,689 --> 01:27:27,839
that regulatory structure because I

1948
01:27:24,460 --> 01:27:30,130
don't think that they have the

1949
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:31,480
infrastructure to test for purity and

1950
01:27:30,130 --> 01:27:34,840
potency and I think that that's like

1951
01:27:31,479 --> 01:27:39,219
those are my concerns like when you deal

1952
01:27:34,840 --> 01:27:40,630
with patients who need to make sure that

1953
01:27:39,220 --> 01:27:42,970
the product that they're taking is

1954
01:27:40,630 --> 01:27:46,420
actually the product and not only that

1955
01:27:42,970 --> 01:27:48,489
like that they aren't taking pesticides

1956
01:27:46,420 --> 01:27:50,619
or heavy metals which cannabis is super

1957
01:27:48,488 --> 01:27:52,839
great at like pulling from the soil you

1958
01:27:50,619 --> 01:27:54,430
need to actually have a testing

1959
01:27:52,840 --> 01:27:56,050
infrastructure which the supplement

1960
01:27:54,430 --> 01:27:57,670
industry doesn't formerly have through

1961
01:27:56,050 --> 01:28:00,220
the federal government although there

1962
01:27:57,670 --> 01:28:04,359
are third-party testing agency is for

1963
01:28:00,220 --> 01:28:06,489
the supplement industry so it's it's a

1964
01:28:04,359 --> 01:28:08,380
mess I came up with like a theoretical

1965
01:28:06,488 --> 01:28:10,439
regulatory structure for the regulation

1966
01:28:08,380 --> 01:28:14,010
of traditional herbal medicinal products

1967
01:28:10,439 --> 01:28:17,259
which would be another category of

1968
01:28:14,010 --> 01:28:19,480
regulation that would ensure purity and

1969
01:28:17,260 --> 01:28:21,760
potency like those are just the tests

1970
01:28:19,479 --> 01:28:23,649
there are a lot of differing opinions on

1971
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:25,570
how to regulate CBD in cannabis but I

1972
01:28:23,649 --> 01:28:30,099
think like as far as you are concerned

1973
01:28:25,569 --> 01:28:33,429
trying to educate your regulators on

1974
01:28:30,100 --> 01:28:36,579
what it is and what it can do its safety

1975
01:28:33,430 --> 01:28:38,170
continuing continuing to provide data to

1976
01:28:36,579 --> 01:28:40,238
the people who can make decisions about

1977
01:28:38,170 --> 01:28:41,619
some of the things yes some of the

1978
01:28:40,238 --> 01:28:43,299
things the FDA has said which is like

1979
01:28:41,619 --> 01:28:45,059
it's not safe well okay we've got all

1980
01:28:43,300 --> 01:28:48,340
these studies showing that it is safe

1981
01:28:45,060 --> 01:28:51,180
here's this and then asking them to like

1982
01:28:48,340 --> 01:28:53,170
come out and regulate I mean I think

1983
01:28:51,180 --> 01:28:56,340
I've talked a little bit about this

1984
01:28:53,170 --> 01:28:59,470
which is like it's possible the FDA is

1985
01:28:56,340 --> 01:29:01,090
sort of sidestepping a little bit they

1986
01:28:59,470 --> 01:29:03,010
would really love to not have to deal

1987
01:29:01,090 --> 01:29:05,230
with this issue because it's a massive

1988
01:29:03,010 --> 01:29:08,800
industry and they don't have money and

1989
01:29:05,229 --> 01:29:10,750
it's like when I dug into how much what

1990
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:12,940
their budget was to regulate the 32

1991
01:29:10,750 --> 01:29:14,789
billion dollar supplement industry last

1992
01:29:12,939 --> 01:29:17,679
year it was twenty three million dollars

1993
01:29:14,789 --> 01:29:20,069
so like where are they gonna get the

1994
01:29:17,680 --> 01:29:22,960
budget to regulate the cannabis industry

1995
01:29:20,069 --> 01:29:24,699
so I don't really have their solutions

1996
01:29:22,960 --> 01:29:28,920
yet but there's a lot of learning going

1997
01:29:24,699 --> 01:29:31,289
on and I think like it isn't

1998
01:29:28,920 --> 01:29:33,659
to be familiar with what's going on and

1999
01:29:31,289 --> 01:29:36,260
just please please please don't be

2000
01:29:33,659 --> 01:29:38,519
afraid of talking to your

2001
01:29:36,260 --> 01:29:40,050
representatives and congresspeople

2002
01:29:38,520 --> 01:29:40,980
and I know it's a pain in the butt and

2003
01:29:40,050 --> 01:29:42,570
it feels like you're not getting

2004
01:29:40,979 --> 01:29:43,589
anywhere and like maybe that's true

2005
01:29:42,569 --> 01:29:47,059
because we don't really live in a

2006
01:29:43,590 --> 01:29:48,929
democracy but like it still worth trying

2007
01:29:47,060 --> 01:29:50,640
because that's where we are we still

2008
01:29:48,929 --> 01:29:52,319
have the opportunity to do this right

2009
01:29:50,640 --> 01:29:57,239
and there's a lot of ways to do it wrong

2010
01:29:52,319 --> 01:29:58,979
so my feelings ignore the FDA I mean

2011
01:29:57,238 --> 01:30:01,500
they're they're all they did was just

2012
01:29:58,979 --> 01:30:03,539
say what they're they didn't change

2013
01:30:01,500 --> 01:30:05,488
anything with this statement that not at

2014
01:30:03,539 --> 01:30:14,670
all they basically said we're not going

2015
01:30:05,488 --> 01:30:16,979
to change and very briefly there are two

2016
01:30:14,670 --> 01:30:20,789
ways that you can be sure to run afoul

2017
01:30:16,979 --> 01:30:23,909
of the FDA one is to make a specific

2018
01:30:20,789 --> 01:30:27,119
disease claim that my preparation can

2019
01:30:23,909 --> 01:30:30,179
cure cancer whatever it is you will be

2020
01:30:27,119 --> 01:30:34,679
in trouble with them and the other is to

2021
01:30:30,179 --> 01:30:38,670
have a misrepresentation of the analysis

2022
01:30:34,679 --> 01:30:41,279
of your product if there is not the

2023
01:30:38,670 --> 01:30:43,920
amount that's it should be in there or

2024
01:30:41,279 --> 01:30:46,500
too much compared to what should be in

2025
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:47,850
there and someone complains you'll be in

2026
01:30:46,500 --> 01:30:50,488
trouble

2027
01:30:47,850 --> 01:30:52,560
beyond that I don't think they have the

2028
01:30:50,488 --> 01:30:56,119
bandwidth to deal with this industry

2029
01:30:52,560 --> 01:30:59,429
right now and so it was exactly right

2030
01:30:56,119 --> 01:31:03,719
there sidestepping they they don't have

2031
01:30:59,429 --> 01:31:06,659
the time money or interest and so it was

2032
01:31:03,719 --> 01:31:09,090
a holding action at best but avoid those

2033
01:31:06,659 --> 01:31:11,408
two things and hopefully you stay out of

2034
01:31:09,090 --> 01:31:12,789
trouble

2035
01:31:11,408 --> 01:31:15,309
one of the most important things I

2036
01:31:12,789 --> 01:31:16,600
learned was coming into the industry I

2037
01:31:15,310 --> 01:31:18,880
was designed to me

2038
01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:21,310
and somebody explained the reason why

2039
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:23,679
nobody has ever had at a balloon or

2040
01:31:21,310 --> 01:31:25,710
overdose from cannabis and I did I knew

2041
01:31:23,679 --> 01:31:28,869
that it was true that I didn't know why

2042
01:31:25,710 --> 01:31:30,489
we can can clean up the details of what

2043
01:31:28,869 --> 01:31:33,189
I tell you that this is basically true

2044
01:31:30,488 --> 01:31:34,988
the reason that people died from drug

2045
01:31:33,189 --> 01:31:37,629
overdose usually is because their brains

2046
01:31:34,988 --> 01:31:38,919
been shuts down and it makes them stop

2047
01:31:37,630 --> 01:31:40,440
baby that makes her heart stopped

2048
01:31:38,920 --> 01:31:43,420
beating their brain stopped functioning

2049
01:31:40,439 --> 01:31:45,759
and their brain stem is loaded with

2050
01:31:43,420 --> 01:31:47,440
opiate receptors or opiate receptors or

2051
01:31:45,760 --> 01:31:49,210
whatever they're called there are no

2052
01:31:47,439 --> 01:31:55,539
cannabinoid receptors in the brain stem

2053
01:31:49,210 --> 01:31:57,939
so no matter how much and nobody ever

2054
01:31:55,539 --> 01:32:00,069
has when somebody thinks maybe one

2055
01:31:57,939 --> 01:32:02,069
person died it's big news which proves

2056
01:32:00,069 --> 01:32:04,750
the point so if you're communicating

2057
01:32:02,069 --> 01:32:07,029
with your constituents to your

2058
01:32:04,750 --> 01:32:11,198
Congressman whatever Congress person

2059
01:32:07,029 --> 01:32:13,869
make sure that you have just enough

2060
01:32:11,198 --> 01:32:16,299
facts probably even though things don't

2061
01:32:13,869 --> 01:32:18,250
wait instead tell them this is a reason

2062
01:32:16,300 --> 01:32:20,650
why no one has ever ever overdosed which

2063
01:32:18,250 --> 01:32:23,560
is why the whole approach to regulating

2064
01:32:20,649 --> 01:32:27,448
this as a dangerous drug is messed up

2065
01:32:23,560 --> 01:32:27,449
from the start you want to clean

2066
01:32:32,520 --> 01:32:37,960
what Neil said was exactly right there

2067
01:32:35,199 --> 01:32:41,170
are scattered cannabinoid receptors in

2068
01:32:37,960 --> 01:32:45,520
the brain stem but not in the center's

2069
01:32:41,170 --> 01:32:48,909
that subserve respiration again so as he

2070
01:32:45,520 --> 01:32:50,920
said the mule receptor too much heroin

2071
01:32:48,909 --> 01:32:51,489
you stop breathing and you die because

2072
01:32:50,920 --> 01:32:55,260
of that

2073
01:32:51,489 --> 01:32:59,439
it's not because it's actually killing

2074
01:32:55,260 --> 01:33:01,780
any organ in the body but it's putting

2075
01:32:59,439 --> 01:33:06,309
your brain to sleep and you forget to

2076
01:33:01,779 --> 01:33:08,340
breathe and cannabis cannot do that it

2077
01:33:06,310 --> 01:33:14,470
just doesn't happen

2078
01:33:08,340 --> 01:33:17,829
so that wasn't a lot of cleaning up add

2079
01:33:14,470 --> 01:33:20,590
one thing to the list of no nose for the

2080
01:33:17,829 --> 01:33:22,779
FDA it is definitely unsubstantiated

2081
01:33:20,590 --> 01:33:27,340
medical claims on your packaging is

2082
01:33:22,779 --> 01:33:29,649
number one incorrect dosage on a package

2083
01:33:27,340 --> 01:33:32,470
but the other one is unsubstantiated

2084
01:33:29,649 --> 01:33:35,500
label claims based on ingredient content

2085
01:33:32,470 --> 01:33:38,440
that will hit you almost harder than if

2086
01:33:35,500 --> 01:33:42,489
you have the wrong amount of milligrams

2087
01:33:38,439 --> 01:33:45,549
of whatever it is taraxacum or calendula

2088
01:33:42,489 --> 01:33:48,789
like not having the appropriate species

2089
01:33:45,550 --> 01:33:49,930
on your label they will ding you for so

2090
01:33:48,789 --> 01:33:51,880
that's one thing everyone should start

2091
01:33:49,930 --> 01:33:55,480
to keep in mind as things become more

2092
01:33:51,880 --> 01:33:57,489
normalized and our products become you

2093
01:33:55,479 --> 01:33:59,649
know taken out of the dispensary proper

2094
01:33:57,489 --> 01:34:04,359
and maybe are sitting in an apothecary

2095
01:33:59,649 --> 01:34:05,589
or a normal drugstore if your label

2096
01:34:04,359 --> 01:34:07,329
claims if you say you have lavender in

2097
01:34:05,590 --> 01:34:09,250
there you better have lavender in there

2098
01:34:07,329 --> 01:34:11,079
and there better not be anything else in

2099
01:34:09,250 --> 01:34:14,409
there so those are exceptionally

2100
01:34:11,079 --> 01:34:17,050
important to the FDA and zoeng have a

2101
01:34:14,409 --> 01:34:20,229
very healthy disagreement about the

2102
01:34:17,050 --> 01:34:22,690
regulation of natural products they're

2103
01:34:20,229 --> 01:34:23,919
heavily regulated so the the landscape I

2104
01:34:22,689 --> 01:34:26,439
work in I consult with a lot of

2105
01:34:23,920 --> 01:34:28,539
individuals I am a third-party tester

2106
01:34:26,439 --> 01:34:31,000
for botanical identity because if you

2107
01:34:28,539 --> 01:34:32,920
don't have those label claims correct my

2108
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:34,569
clients get sued and they get their

2109
01:34:32,920 --> 01:34:36,869
products pulled from shelves and it's

2110
01:34:34,569 --> 01:34:39,250
hundreds of thousands of dollars of

2111
01:34:36,869 --> 01:34:41,170
fixing that issue

2112
01:34:39,250 --> 01:34:43,300
and if you really want to say a breast

2113
01:34:41,170 --> 01:34:45,190
to the FDA issue one of the best

2114
01:34:43,300 --> 01:34:46,810
organizations I would encourage all of

2115
01:34:45,189 --> 01:34:49,689
you to at least look at them if not

2116
01:34:46,810 --> 01:34:51,940
become an active member is Appa is the

2117
01:34:49,689 --> 01:34:54,579
American Herbal Products Association

2118
01:34:51,939 --> 01:34:58,199
it's the largest trade association that

2119
01:34:54,579 --> 01:35:01,390
is an advocate for natural products

2120
01:34:58,199 --> 01:35:03,399
supplements and natural medicines and

2121
01:35:01,390 --> 01:35:04,869
they deal not only in the national scale

2122
01:35:03,399 --> 01:35:07,289
but the international scale and they're

2123
01:35:04,869 --> 01:35:10,809
a really great resource like if you want

2124
01:35:07,289 --> 01:35:12,970
digested commentary about what the FDA

2125
01:35:10,810 --> 01:35:14,620
is put out with you know what's

2126
01:35:12,970 --> 01:35:17,079
happening with the DEA with various

2127
01:35:14,619 --> 01:35:19,029
aspects of cannabis and CBD they're an

2128
01:35:17,079 --> 01:35:21,939
exceptional resource and they do amazing

2129
01:35:19,029 --> 01:35:24,609
advocacy they also have a cannabis

2130
01:35:21,939 --> 01:35:27,189
committee which I'm a member of which

2131
01:35:24,609 --> 01:35:29,819
everyone should be a part of its an open

2132
01:35:27,189 --> 01:35:32,439
committee your opinions are really

2133
01:35:29,819 --> 01:35:35,079
important because they really have

2134
01:35:32,439 --> 01:35:36,849
access to the government in a way that

2135
01:35:35,079 --> 01:35:39,159
most of our small organizations can

2136
01:35:36,850 --> 01:35:42,400
never have that kind of access so if

2137
01:35:39,159 --> 01:35:45,069
it's office American Herbal Products

2138
01:35:42,399 --> 01:35:46,719
Association yeah so they do a lot of

2139
01:35:45,069 --> 01:35:50,710
work and they do a lot of work with the

2140
01:35:46,720 --> 01:35:53,289
other plants right so when comfrey was

2141
01:35:50,710 --> 01:35:55,689
banned basically for use they did a lot

2142
01:35:53,289 --> 01:35:57,880
of work so they support us as herbalists

2143
01:35:55,689 --> 01:36:00,399
and as community healers and in ways

2144
01:35:57,880 --> 01:36:01,720
that are outside the normal work we do

2145
01:36:00,399 --> 01:36:03,129
within our own communities and so I

2146
01:36:01,720 --> 01:36:10,690
would really encourage you to check them

2147
01:36:03,130 --> 01:36:13,690
out one thing just really quickly with

2148
