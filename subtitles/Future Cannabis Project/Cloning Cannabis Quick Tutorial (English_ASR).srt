00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,320
how's it going welcome to the oa farm

3
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:32,000
just want to show you guys a couple tips

4
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,359
on how to use some of our products for

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,479
uh cloning

6
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:36,238
if you want to come over here we're

7
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:38,319
going to just take a snip usually i like

8
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:39,919
to just kind of look at

9
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:43,280
look around you can see we've taken a

10
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,280
couple off the top here and

11
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:46,718
oh this is a nice one here so look at

12
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:49,200
that

13
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,320
gauge it cut it about right there let

14
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,600
that go

15
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,759
it's kind of like how i like to do my

16
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:57,359
clones not too big not too small

17
00:00:53,759 --> 00:01:02,399
easy i take that first clip

18
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:04,159
right on that 45 a couple clones there

19
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,599
and snip off the top now there's a lot

20
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,719
of

21
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:12,158
a lot of i don't know what you'd call it

22
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:14,478
science or different ways of cloning

23
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:16,479
so this is our way and we snip off the

24
00:01:14,478 --> 00:01:18,640
top we've been doing it for years

25
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:19,759
it's kind of ocd i know there's some

26
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,719
science behind it

27
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:24,079
some transpiration but uh that's kind of

28
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:26,560
how we like it nice and clean

29
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:28,000
easy and we do is if you're using the

30
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,400
microbial solution

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,478
we like to do is we'd like to do a brew

32
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,719
this is a four gallon brew pack

33
00:01:32,478 --> 00:01:35,519
we'll do a brew for 24 hours and check

34
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:37,840
out the website

35
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:40,000
for the those videos and what we'll do

36
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,000
is actually take the whole clone

37
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,040
and we'll dump it right in the entire

38
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,159
brew and just give her a nice bath

39
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:50,159
all the cuts you've just made

40
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,840
get some biology some beneficial biology

41
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,040
in those what we'll do is we'll actually

42
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,200
take a tip

43
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,320
dip it in fpf at one milliliter per

44
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,079
gallon

45
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:59,599
we go straight into the router now any

46
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:01,599
router is fine for you guys doesn't

47
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:02,718
doesn't matter whatever works for you

48
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:04,399
again i know there's a lot of different

49
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:05,039
ways just kind of some tips we like to

50
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:07,280
do

51
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,560
and then we actually take make sure we

52
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,878
don't go all the way through we're kind

53
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,560
of

54
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:12,159
almost to the end there we like to give

55
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,840
her a little bit of room and then we dip

56
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:16,079
it straight into the biological solution

57
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,080
here

58
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:20,560
there we go she finds a nice home so

59
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,080
easy

60
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,159
