1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:06,028
I think we were talking about growing

2
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:08,220
terpene and resin rich cultivars is what

3
00:00:06,028 --> 00:00:13,080
you were talking about right it's

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:16,048
growing and selecting yeah so how to

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:22,250
select was where I was going with that

6
00:00:16,048 --> 00:00:25,500
so I see I see water hash right as a

7
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:27,599
process that does not like some of the

8
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:30,570
cultivars that are like water soluble

9
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,700
terpenes I call them soon as like they

10
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:35,009
touch the water right they totally just

11
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:37,920
disintegrate and your yields are super

12
00:00:35,009 --> 00:00:40,439
low and you're really left with nothing

13
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,850
so it's pretty much just a loss on

14
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:43,890
everyone's and you're pretty much thrown

15
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:48,390
thousands on the way down the drain

16
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:49,739
so to help that my my my years of just

17
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:52,378
kind of like poking around with the

18
00:00:49,738 --> 00:00:54,988
plant and you know breeding have

19
00:00:52,378 --> 00:00:58,829
searched for these bulbous bat heads

20
00:00:54,988 --> 00:01:03,269
that like to act and feel like sand so

21
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:05,180
like that's kind of like the grain you

22
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:09,150
know the hedge structure that I aim for

23
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:15,118
when I'm searching for the hash plant as

24
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:17,689
I like to call it so with that you're

25
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:21,000
really finding it's a lot easier of

26
00:01:17,688 --> 00:01:25,048
extract or a separation from you know

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:29,219
plant and hash at that point because

28
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:30,600
it's just it's like house and is sink to

29
00:01:29,219 --> 00:01:36,239
the bottom of the water and you still

30
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:38,669
have such a something that a head that

31
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:40,759
doesn't want to like fall apart right

32
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:43,759
but are you only looking for one hedge

33
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:43,759
around

34
00:01:46,359 --> 00:01:52,090
right and what the rally I mean we're

35
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:54,490
talking microscopic sand like bags

36
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:56,710
screams I wish there was technology that

37
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:58,869
like I really wish I had that I'm sure

38
00:01:56,709 --> 00:02:00,729
it exists Stephen and maybe I just need

39
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:02,320
to get better with using certain tools

40
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:04,950
but it would be really cool to actually

41
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:09,879
have something that we could take a real

42
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:12,430
generic measurement and size of a

43
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:15,340
trichome head to know how big it is in

44
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:18,879
ratio compared to the stock the head

45
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:21,479
ratio also I'm sure we can kind of see

46
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:24,159
how thick the cuticle actually is and

47
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:27,189
determine you know maybe possibly how

48
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:29,169
quickly it will potentially dissolve in

49
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:31,240
the water or if it will not or whatever

50
00:02:29,169 --> 00:02:33,729
but yeah I don't think it's necessarily

51
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:35,620
about looking for the actual physicality

52
00:02:33,729 --> 00:02:38,169
of the trichome that it's more about

53
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:40,120
finding that right texture or that right

54
00:02:38,169 --> 00:02:41,799
dryness is what I think he's trying to

55
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:43,719
say and to me the only way to fucking

56
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,340
figure that out is to wash it I have

57
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:47,319
people who asked me on consulting gigs

58
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:49,539
all the time to come and be like tell me

59
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:51,969
how to use a microscope and determine

60
00:02:49,539 --> 00:02:54,159
what a hash strain is or they'll send me

61
00:02:51,969 --> 00:02:56,319
weed like this is gonna smash look at

62
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:59,409
this it's gonna yield and I always say

63
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:01,030
if we're washing for fresh frozen cool

64
00:02:59,409 --> 00:03:02,769
if it's dried material it's probably

65
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:04,959
gonna work out if it looks trichome rich

66
00:03:02,769 --> 00:03:06,760
cool but if we're washing for fresh

67
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,860
frozen the only way to figure it out is

68
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:10,780
to wash for fresh frozen as far as I

69
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:12,550
know or that's the best way to know and

70
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:15,099
you'll know really quick into it you

71
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:16,989
know just by your paddle but like you'll

72
00:03:15,099 --> 00:03:19,000
know if it's sticky or like oh this is a

73
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:21,370
really shitty resin and this is gonna be

74
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,069
hard for me to work with I guess like

75
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:25,689
not just the dry granular like head I

76
00:03:24,069 --> 00:03:29,530
was like I'm even talking like live

77
00:03:25,689 --> 00:03:31,509
fresh plant like that's how I know it

78
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:33,039
will good be a good fresh frozen I can

79
00:03:31,509 --> 00:03:35,709
actually just like slightly touch the

80
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:36,969
plant where is it it bursts almost you

81
00:03:35,709 --> 00:03:39,280
know what I mean or you can see well you

82
00:03:36,969 --> 00:03:41,080
I can see literally you know the heads

83
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,689
pop right off like fresh fruit right off

84
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:47,700
the tree you know and still be in that

85
00:03:43,689 --> 00:03:50,098
solid head form I mean to me the shape

86
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:55,560
but oval shape I don't know

87
00:03:50,098 --> 00:03:57,358
so but that but but getting it right

88
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:00,269
before you know you go down the rabbit

89
00:03:57,359 --> 00:04:02,459
hole of did we waste the wash or not you

90
00:04:00,269 --> 00:04:04,498
know that's to touch it to feel it right

91
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:06,509
then in there to gain something from

92
00:04:04,498 --> 00:04:08,370
that Games a lot yeah I mean you're not

93
00:04:06,509 --> 00:04:09,899
gonna know exactly you know

94
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:13,500
percentage-wise or anything you're just

95
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:15,569
going to know because yeah I think it's

96
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:17,788
just like those some plans you could

97
00:04:15,568 --> 00:04:20,038
touch and if we want to talk to some

98
00:04:17,788 --> 00:04:24,478
plants I think alignment the lime lemon

99
00:04:20,038 --> 00:04:27,598
lime terpene lime I mean that terpene is

100
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:29,879
harder terpene to get into that type of

101
00:04:27,598 --> 00:04:33,478
resin and I think it's because it comes

102
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:34,978
from more of a sativa dominant plant

103
00:04:33,478 --> 00:04:38,069
that's closer to the equator like

104
00:04:34,978 --> 00:04:40,379
Frenchy was saying the the rain and the

105
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:41,759
climate and the plants are adapting to

106
00:04:40,379 --> 00:04:46,529
these places you know though that

107
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:50,639
equator area to me doesn't make a type

108
00:04:46,529 --> 00:04:53,728
of solvent less hash of the ice water

109
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,408
extraction way so I find it's the

110
00:04:53,728 --> 00:04:59,279
mountain plants the you know the

111
00:04:55,408 --> 00:05:01,529
Pakistanis the cushions that have you

112
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:03,478
know adapted to that climate that you

113
00:05:01,529 --> 00:05:06,138
know make those heads and that's the

114
00:05:03,478 --> 00:05:09,469
thing so when we step out of that

115
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:12,030
Afghani you know Pakistani pushes

116
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:13,650
breeding out of that into like what we

117
00:05:12,029 --> 00:05:22,649
found today and these are the hash

118
00:05:13,649 --> 00:05:24,209
plants of today you know I think that's

119
00:05:22,649 --> 00:05:25,620
another big thing to bring up is it just

120
00:05:24,209 --> 00:05:26,939
like when you're a hash maker and you're

121
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:30,658
just washing other people's material

122
00:05:26,939 --> 00:05:32,098
it's really not it's not that big of an

123
00:05:30,658 --> 00:05:34,199
investment it's not that much of a

124
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:35,848
commitment all it is is your time you

125
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:38,098
know right I could take someone's yard

126
00:05:35,848 --> 00:05:40,819
in and process it in an entire day a

127
00:05:38,098 --> 00:05:43,319
hundred pounds process it in a day and

128
00:05:40,819 --> 00:05:45,930
again what did it take it took a day in

129
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:48,360
my time that gardener that it took them

130
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:50,218
to grow that whatever took months you

131
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:52,650
know possibly if it was outdoor six

132
00:05:50,218 --> 00:05:56,129
months so all I'm saying is like to be

133
00:05:52,649 --> 00:05:58,198
someone who simply washes other people's

134
00:05:56,129 --> 00:06:00,120
material to me is just a completely

135
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:01,079
different journey he and I both

136
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:04,829
single-source

137
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:07,560
I choose to only pretty much wash my own

138
00:06:04,829 --> 00:06:09,990
material I don't really I'm not

139
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:12,538
currently interested in washing someone

140
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:15,180
else's material maybe one day that will

141
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:17,550
go my path but I grow enough material to

142
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:21,269
keep me busy keep me interested and

143
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:24,449
that's really what intrigues me is to

144
00:06:21,269 --> 00:06:27,810
take the resin from clone all the way to

145
00:06:24,449 --> 00:06:30,210
the end of harvest to then process it

146
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:33,509
through hash and see what comes out on

147
00:06:30,209 --> 00:06:36,448
the other end it's like the resin wants

148
00:06:33,509 --> 00:06:38,639
you to harvest it it knows you you grew

149
00:06:36,449 --> 00:06:40,978
it you made it you created it it wants

150
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:43,500
you and I feel like it gives it up to

151
00:06:40,978 --> 00:06:45,300
you more you know we're like the yields

152
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:47,610
I get I tell people them and they're

153
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:49,680
just like all those percentages aren't

154
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:51,629
real you know and it's just like I don't

155
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,519
know there's something to that there's

156
00:06:51,629 --> 00:07:01,528
something real romantic and deep about

157
00:06:53,519 --> 00:07:03,240
it you know 100% yeah this is yeah we're

158
00:07:01,528 --> 00:07:06,269
waiting for terpenes we're breathing for

159
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:08,579
obviously yield good yields so it's

160
00:07:06,269 --> 00:07:10,259
worth our time and we can get more

161
00:07:08,579 --> 00:07:11,908
absolute like what are some winning

162
00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:14,449
genetics right and you asked what

163
00:07:11,908 --> 00:07:16,860
flavors are you growing I'm growing some

164
00:07:14,449 --> 00:07:18,449
we got a whole bunch of bunch of

165
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:22,229
different ones but like some of them are

166
00:07:18,449 --> 00:07:27,030
ice cream cake we have that's a good one

167
00:07:22,228 --> 00:07:31,699
golden strawberries you had

168
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:34,489
just made guava punch there's a no one

169
00:07:31,699 --> 00:07:36,949
and there's a lot really I'm trying to

170
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:38,720
go down the list but what's something

171
00:07:36,949 --> 00:07:40,279
that you watch that you were excited

172
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,370
with high hopes and then Alegent

173
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:46,279
disappointed you four or five years ago

174
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:48,590
as purple diesels just the other day I

175
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:51,259
watched mimosa it's like kind of a hype

176
00:07:48,589 --> 00:07:53,389
California strain it's a tangi crossed

177
00:07:51,259 --> 00:07:55,819
with purple bunch there's two different

178
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:58,339
like cuts out there that are circulating

179
00:07:55,819 --> 00:08:00,620
in crowds one's more tangi leaning ones

180
00:07:58,339 --> 00:08:02,839
more purple punch leaning they say oh

181
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:05,090
the purple punch leaner is a hash strain

182
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:07,579
because purple punch is it's a pretty

183
00:08:05,089 --> 00:08:09,919
good hash sure tangey stereotypically in

184
00:08:07,579 --> 00:08:12,469
my opinion is not a great hasher so

185
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:14,390
again I was told I had the purple punch

186
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:16,700
leaner structurally it looked purple

187
00:08:14,389 --> 00:08:19,610
punch I was like this is gonna do it'll

188
00:08:16,699 --> 00:08:20,389
be decent it's gonna be alright 2% or

189
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:23,270
something like that

190
00:08:20,389 --> 00:08:23,959
it was literally Oh point zero four

191
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:26,719
percent

192
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:29,509
I got like 30 grams off of four pounds

193
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,100
what would be dry material it's not

194
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:33,470
sustainable and that's the whole thing

195
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:34,820
is is like yeah we love making hash yeah

196
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:36,110
we love and that's the other thing is

197
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:37,310
like it's not only if it was maybe the

198
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:39,139
world's best hash

199
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:40,939
I wouldn't fucking care I would eat it

200
00:08:39,139 --> 00:08:42,470
that hard and be like whatever I'll keep

201
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:44,720
this all for myself and I have the

202
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:46,190
world's best ash but it wasn't even like

203
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,259
that great of a hash string and that's

204
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:49,610
what I find is like a lot of people

205
00:08:48,259 --> 00:08:53,000
sometimes think that well like sometimes

206
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:56,060
those low Yolo yielders are just great

207
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,610
and like in my experience it's not that

208
00:08:56,059 --> 00:09:00,679
way either the resin is capturable or

209
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:04,190
it's not either you can grab it and

210
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:06,949
harness it or you can't and like I said

211
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:09,830
yeah I watched some mimosa and I ate it

212
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:11,770
it was awful it was terrible I usually

213
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:14,300
like the ones that you eat it on like

214
00:09:11,769 --> 00:09:15,669
and it doesn't work you can find that

215
00:09:14,299 --> 00:09:19,990
terpene and another

216
00:09:15,669 --> 00:09:21,639
usually fuck yeah yeah or cross it with

217
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:23,680
something else so that mimosa if I loved

218
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:25,419
that I could just find something better

219
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:27,129
myself and go hit it with it and maybe

220
00:09:25,419 --> 00:09:28,569
next season get it you know and I mean

221
00:09:27,129 --> 00:09:34,210
but yeah you gotta mess around with

222
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:36,610
lines out history so it's a cool little

223
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:39,190
like adult toy you know what I mean like

224
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:42,370
it is what it is what I'll find is like

225
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:45,250
it worked really well indoors on like

226
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:47,080
your coffee table out here with like it

227
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:49,870
being cold and you know it is even just

228
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:51,730
doing dabs outside like the temps never

229
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:53,320
the same when I said this temperature so

230
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:55,450
to me it wasn't working really well

231
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:58,210
outside but it is what it is it was fun

232
00:09:55,450 --> 00:10:04,330
it was cool to do it like inside fun

233
00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:07,000
little toy not necessary by any means so

234
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:09,100
again the I have a bunch of like you to

235
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:13,299
saying drier resins that run really well

236
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:18,940
man like animal cookies that was 3% it's

237
00:10:13,299 --> 00:10:20,919
really good like GMO I rot 8% off that's

238
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:23,680
the best I've ever gotten like you know

239
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:25,929
what I mean like it's north its

240
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:28,809
strawberry banana like that's hash

241
00:10:25,929 --> 00:10:35,039
strains motorbreath hash string key lime

242
00:10:28,809 --> 00:10:36,399
hash strain last year at the region I

243
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:40,959
had some

244
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:42,639
they evoke oh yo so this is literally

245
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:44,500
from the same batch I just had it in my

246
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:46,389
fridge forever you know and I mean but

247
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:56,470
please smoke as much as you want man

248
00:10:46,389 --> 00:10:59,039
it's literally from the same plugin I'm

249
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:59,040
sorry I apologize

250
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:06,820
he basically grows his own he's never

251
00:11:05,019 --> 00:11:16,028
smoked the flower he just turns it all

252
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:20,528
in the hatch sure sure I thought it was

253
00:11:16,028 --> 00:11:21,460
a cool story cuz heat like yeah fuck

254
00:11:20,528 --> 00:11:24,278
yeah I got you man

255
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:27,129
I'll get you want a GM oh yeah yeah oh

256
00:11:24,278 --> 00:11:28,480
yeah I'll give you that too animal

257
00:11:27,129 --> 00:11:30,429
cookies yeah

258
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:34,960
I'll get you it's that cold cure like

259
00:11:30,429 --> 00:11:37,719
flan shit so he's whole plant washing

260
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:39,730
and and and is he dumping like is he

261
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:41,830
bringing all the material back into the

262
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:47,550
greenhouse how was he working for it was

263
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:47,550
he feeding with I know

264
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:59,310
that's a big thing for me with living

265
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:01,950
soil for me I've been building like my

266
00:11:59,309 --> 00:12:07,979
soil for quite slike handful of years

267
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:10,050
now and like a lot of people have been

268
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:13,590
building in the last like hope like two

269
00:12:10,049 --> 00:12:15,779
years or even year and I noticed what I

270
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:19,440
did it in the first year to like I had

271
00:12:15,779 --> 00:12:22,439
to really like take a detrimental like

272
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:27,780
crop like yield loss because I wasn't

273
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:31,290
fertile oh yeah we got better yeah it

274
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:40,079
gets better but yeah just wondering how

275
00:12:31,289 --> 00:12:42,209
is like how many years like well yeah as

276
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:44,190
long as you dedicate and stay true to it

277
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:46,620
and I feel like when you cut corners and

278
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:48,300
you want to like supplement add

279
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:49,789
something in because you feel like it's

280
00:12:48,299 --> 00:12:52,620
necessary

281
00:12:49,789 --> 00:12:56,069
it ends up maybe taking two steps back

282
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:58,230
sometimes you know and sometimes it's to

283
00:12:56,070 --> 00:13:07,920
each his own but I feel that from a

284
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:14,279
strong have you tried this California

285
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:14,789
hash oh yeah I love I grew up on the

286
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:19,230
East Coast

287
00:13:14,789 --> 00:13:21,299
always cultural like New Jersey and it

288
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:25,110
was just it was it was a religious thing

289
00:13:21,299 --> 00:13:27,419
in a young kids age over there to to

290
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:31,730
roll up a bunt in between just about

291
00:13:27,419 --> 00:13:31,729
everything you do so yeah

292
00:13:38,119 --> 00:13:43,800
yeah totally there is this like whole

293
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:46,679
nother like do this is right no like

294
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:50,519
part is new you know new not like

295
00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:52,828
brand-new but freeze dryer is not that

296
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:54,089
old it's probably like five years old

297
00:13:52,828 --> 00:13:55,888
you know but in the grand scheme of

298
00:13:54,089 --> 00:13:58,920
things it is yeah yeah because they just

299
00:13:55,889 --> 00:14:01,589
came out the pharmaceutical yeah that's

300
00:13:58,919 --> 00:14:08,568
new so of course young people are doing

301
00:14:01,589 --> 00:14:10,980
it you know so honestly I Butte baby I

302
00:14:08,568 --> 00:14:14,099
just used trash Burroughs man and I am

303
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:16,230
helping my friend who has like a nice

304
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:19,170
facility back east that I'm helping out

305
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:21,569
with he's went and got those things and

306
00:14:19,169 --> 00:14:23,578
you spent $16,000 all um and I literally

307
00:14:21,568 --> 00:14:25,409
told him like man I'm gonna go to

308
00:14:23,578 --> 00:14:27,748
Walmart and probably buy some food trash

309
00:14:25,409 --> 00:14:29,428
barrels and like go maybe we'll go ahead

310
00:14:27,749 --> 00:14:30,959
maybe maybe we'll mess with those

311
00:14:29,428 --> 00:14:32,999
they're cool they're really nice I'm not

312
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:35,248
knocking it you know like if you come on

313
00:14:32,999 --> 00:14:36,808
if you're gonna spend it's not cheap if

314
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:39,240
you're gonna spend all this money on

315
00:14:36,808 --> 00:14:42,058
like you know I have the be-all-end-all

316
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:43,470
lab and you're a big brand yeah cool get

317
00:14:42,058 --> 00:14:48,389
it man but like what I try to tell

318
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:48,839
people is like you can invest in a more

319
00:14:48,389 --> 00:14:51,350
money

320
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:54,540
minimal money that you can instantly

321
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:56,909
recoup in solving this it is not rocket

322
00:14:54,539 --> 00:14:57,568
science mechanical extraction is not

323
00:14:56,909 --> 00:15:02,519
hard

324
00:14:57,568 --> 00:15:06,240
I truly believe yeah yeah no machine

325
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:07,470
that gives you the ability control and

326
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,629
that's the whole other thing was like

327
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:13,410
once you start to know the resin so

328
00:15:09,629 --> 00:15:16,289
intimately I can soak my material and

329
00:15:13,409 --> 00:15:18,120
just look at it and be like I need to

330
00:15:16,289 --> 00:15:20,399
hit it this long I need to wash it this

331
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:22,828
many times I should row it this hard you

332
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:25,379
know and I mean and I'm gonna make Mel I

333
00:15:22,828 --> 00:15:26,669
should ease off I'm gonna make rods and

334
00:15:25,379 --> 00:15:28,269
I'm just gonna get it you know what I

335
00:15:26,669 --> 00:15:30,278
mean like

336
00:15:28,269 --> 00:15:32,110
there's just yeah I wash different ways

337
00:15:30,278 --> 00:15:35,678
for different things and that's why I

338
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:38,289
like and rowing I'm on in a snotty way

339
00:15:35,678 --> 00:15:41,470
like oh it makes the world's best ash it

340
00:15:38,289 --> 00:15:43,629
gives me control that I don't have with

341
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:54,249
the machine because I couldn't afford

342
00:15:43,629 --> 00:15:56,889
Oh 100 are you here hand I draw look at

343
00:15:54,249 --> 00:15:58,829
people get those flip palms really

344
00:15:56,889 --> 00:16:01,329
people like those really expensive

345
00:15:58,828 --> 00:16:03,399
presses and like again well I know you

346
00:16:01,328 --> 00:16:05,349
can make an SOP and show someone how to

347
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:07,749
run those machines and like it's no

348
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:10,240
problem but like me personally I just

349
00:16:07,749 --> 00:16:12,999
like using that hand pump and it's like

350
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:16,028
a fish on the end of a rod like I can

351
00:16:12,999 --> 00:16:18,189
feel the bag resist yeah and then I'm

352
00:16:16,028 --> 00:16:20,769
like go slower yeah and then I feel it

353
00:16:18,188 --> 00:16:22,688
ease into it and you ease it out and I

354
00:16:20,769 --> 00:16:24,369
don't know just something more about the

355
00:16:22,688 --> 00:16:25,899
physicality of it I just feel like

356
00:16:24,369 --> 00:16:28,600
that's what we have to like remain in

357
00:16:25,899 --> 00:16:31,089
this to keep it craft is to be really

358
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:33,369
meticulous about everything we do and to

359
00:16:31,089 --> 00:16:35,619
do what kind of well you can't your own

360
00:16:33,369 --> 00:16:38,170
type in online you can't read in a book

361
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:40,899
right now what our hands are feeling in

362
00:16:38,169 --> 00:16:43,448
that machine or what iPad or what our

363
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:45,789
minds and our eyes would see you have to

364
00:16:43,448 --> 00:16:47,750
do it for so many years you have to lose

365
00:16:45,789 --> 00:16:49,519
so many dollars and then

366
00:16:47,750 --> 00:17:11,449
you know you realize what the hell is

367
00:16:49,519 --> 00:17:13,578

good product

401
00:18:29,829 --> 00:18:34,869
underrated I feel like a little bit you

402
00:18:32,259 --> 00:18:36,429
need to be on every table for sure she

403
00:18:34,869 --> 00:18:39,428
holds it the fuck down so if you can

404
00:18:36,429 --> 00:18:40,320
ever get some black RAM farms hash and

405
00:18:39,429 --> 00:18:48,100
they're lying

406
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:50,619
your honor yeah that uh somebody called

407
00:18:48,099 --> 00:18:52,839
out where BC Bowman I did a field test

408
00:18:50,619 --> 00:18:54,009
it's like field test star tech might be

409
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:56,678
our that's a wide

410
00:18:54,009 --> 00:19:00,970
I call it jarred tech but well it's just

411
00:18:56,679 --> 00:19:01,210
field test with a jar it's a works I

412
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:02,679
guess

413
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:04,690
I mean people should probably do it

414
00:19:02,679 --> 00:19:06,820
because if not you might lose thousands

415
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:10,960
of dollars and just come out looking

416
00:19:06,819 --> 00:19:13,808
like a fool so yeah ice and water you

417
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:15,670
just need some knowledge of hash making

418
00:19:13,808 --> 00:19:17,379
a sense or you need to have something

419
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:18,880
that you know that yields well to base

420
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:21,640
it off well that's the whole thing in my

421
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:23,590
opinion is like I would know that they

422
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:26,100
would already know that you know goes

423
00:19:23,589 --> 00:19:33,819
without saying right goes without so

424
00:19:26,099 --> 00:19:49,659
yeah just a little bit he's a little

425
00:19:33,819 --> 00:19:51,819

430
00:20:13,429 --> 00:20:21,440
it's a great it's a great mastery and

431
00:20:16,609 --> 00:20:33,229

luckily yes luckily I guess oh where the

448
00:21:37,038 --> 00:21:42,349
real high-grade came where when my

449
00:21:39,769 --> 00:21:44,179
little Mecca was like Vermont we got all

450
00:21:42,349 --> 00:21:46,038
our high-grade from Vermont we used to

451
00:21:44,179 --> 00:21:48,019
like joke about getting the high grade

452
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:50,089
from the hippies in Vermont and it was

453
00:21:48,019 --> 00:21:51,950
real you know they had it that was the

454
00:21:50,089 --> 00:21:55,250
scene that was our Humboldt was up there

455
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:57,110
and that's where I went after as soon as

456
00:21:55,250 --> 00:22:00,919
I got became an adult I moved up to

457
00:21:57,109 --> 00:22:05,259
Vermont followed ganj up there and those

458
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:12,970
are myosin so it was to the

459
00:22:05,259 --> 00:22:21,099
east of there actually for skiing or

460
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:23,319
snowboarding would you melon I used to

461
00:22:21,099 --> 00:22:27,339
ride Jay Peak that was my spot I was up

462
00:22:23,319 --> 00:22:29,379
in like eating area and Jay but uh those

463
00:22:27,339 --> 00:22:32,289
are my fondest memories when I was a kid

464
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:34,210
like yeah like I said we didn't I didn't

465
00:22:32,289 --> 00:22:36,609
really know what high grade was we got

466
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:38,140
like be stirs that was what we got and

467
00:22:36,609 --> 00:22:41,319
like they like it was like Canadian

468
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:43,090
indoor hydroponic weed and I thought

469
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:44,799
that was the best because it was better

470
00:22:43,089 --> 00:22:47,169
than the Mexican weed that we would get

471
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:49,599
you know I mean and then someone showed

472
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:52,930
me like Trinity weed it was called the

473
00:22:49,599 --> 00:22:54,639
Trinity but it was from Vermont that's

474
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:57,250
when I was like oh this is what real

475
00:22:54,640 --> 00:23:03,130
weed is and it just changed my whole

476
00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:05,079
view on it and so again they were

477
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:08,740
growing this shit skunk number six that

478
00:23:05,079 --> 00:23:10,269
if I could uh I would do things for if I

479
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:12,309
could get that today man I would do

480
00:23:10,269 --> 00:23:15,369
things for sure and uh had white grape

481
00:23:12,309 --> 00:23:18,250
Afghani had a green spirit the show

482
00:23:15,369 --> 00:23:20,679
called the Elvis at Trinity was really

483
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:23,440
the most elite stuff that like everyone

484
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:24,940
grabbed up that we would get mr. nice

485
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,950
guy over there that was way different

486
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:32,590
than the West Coast mr. nice guy it was

487
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:33,279
like green and it was fire and that's

488
00:23:32,589 --> 00:23:35,500
the thing

489
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:37,210
even the a K we used to get back there

490
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:39,400
was different than like the West Coast a

491
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:41,289
K not saying one's better than the other

492
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:45,970
there were just different different cups

493
00:23:41,289 --> 00:23:49,710
in my opinion yeah those were the ones

494
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:51,970
that really burned in my head you know

495
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:54,220
used to get this other one almost called

496
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:56,589
gnarls burg you know I was probably just

497
00:23:54,220 --> 00:24:00,400
some cheese some kind of cheese cross

498
00:23:56,589 --> 00:24:02,259
but uh I was really fired man that's

499
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,700
cool to like date your life I can like

500
00:24:02,259 --> 00:24:07,950
think back to different points in my

501
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:07,950
life and be like what was I smoking them

502
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:17,620
there was Manhattan haze coming around

503
00:24:13,019 --> 00:24:20,440
Brown hey talk about the AIDS in the

504
00:24:17,619 --> 00:24:24,099
south the haze in the shower was

505
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:27,130
irregular for us I had friends that

506
00:24:24,099 --> 00:24:33,219
would eat sleep and breathe office our D

507
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:37,720
there was yeah it's a it's a sour diet

508
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:40,299
the dour diet called sour D haze and

509
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:41,680
what we called pith which was sometimes

510
00:24:40,299 --> 00:24:43,149
like some people call it from the haze

511
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:45,400
but the results is it's like really

512
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:46,690
cushy it literally we call it like

513
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:50,190
almost like spongebob was like this

514
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:53,080
spongy hippie like just the first like

515
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:55,480
craziest-looking really chronically and

516
00:24:53,079 --> 00:24:59,319
we always called that piff so and then

517
00:24:55,480 --> 00:25:01,779
blue dreams I think it was around 2010

518
00:24:59,319 --> 00:25:04,629
blue dreams started coming down from

519
00:25:01,779 --> 00:25:07,539
SoCal I'm cutting open the first vacuum

520
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:09,430
of vac bags and that's and then I left

521
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:10,809
to Jersey to Jersey yeah we were smoking

522
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:14,680
the real blue dream we're smell like

523
00:25:10,809 --> 00:25:17,289
dryer sheets and that shit was 2010 and

524
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:20,259
then I do remits

525
00:25:17,289 --> 00:25:22,629
on the East Coast oh yeah if it's a real

526
00:25:20,259 --> 00:25:24,250
cut if it's that cut they grown whoever

527
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:26,950
they drew it yeah I don't know but I

528
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:29,049
don't smoke anymore so poor I mean it'll

529
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:31,960
come back around but I don't smoke it

530
00:25:29,049 --> 00:25:33,039
anymore today yeah so I did some

531
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:35,079
laughing because that's what everyone

532
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:37,990
always argues it's like well no but the

533
00:25:35,079 --> 00:25:39,429
blue dream I had yeah I'm sure I'm not

534
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:42,950
saying it wasn't I agree with you though

535
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:45,740
the blue dream 2010 yeah no I hear that

536
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:53,538
the current phase yeah yes a real shit

537
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:56,269
so yeah that was fuckin awesome good

538
00:25:53,538 --> 00:25:58,519
things good things always from the haze

539
00:25:56,269 --> 00:26:01,069
so we don't get that out west here so

540
00:25:58,519 --> 00:26:06,609
I'm gonna try to I think in the future

541
00:26:01,069 --> 00:26:06,609
find a haze plan that washes really well

542
00:26:07,119 --> 00:26:15,319
yeah I'm always chasing like that new

543
00:26:13,429 --> 00:26:19,130
turf you know and I mean just that new

544
00:26:15,319 --> 00:26:21,710
something like I got some like Tropicana

545
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:23,630
fucking cookies crossed with papaya

546
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:25,429
recently seeds that I'm only getting

547
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:27,919
forward to croc like pop it in like

548
00:26:25,429 --> 00:26:30,019
papaya chirps are really popular right

549
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:31,700
now I'll probably be played by the time

550
00:26:30,019 --> 00:26:34,009
I have them in my hands but you know how

551
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:37,090
it goes but uh yeah I'm always just onto

552
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:40,308
that next thing man you know for sure ya

553
00:26:37,089 --> 00:26:42,980
know I go for that haze effect when we

554
00:26:40,308 --> 00:26:44,450
can take a dab of that uh that type of

555
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:45,829
shit that makes your heart want to pop

556
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:48,319
out of your chest and you get like

557
00:26:45,829 --> 00:26:50,629
freaked out in a big crowd when was the

558
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:52,398
last time you got high like that for me

559
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:54,139
it's been fucking forever so I kind of

560
00:26:52,398 --> 00:27:01,048
like I'd pay big money to have that

561
00:26:54,138 --> 00:27:03,959
again I need that dude I yeah I want

562
00:27:01,048 --> 00:27:05,730
I'm pretty chill like I can't well and

563
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:07,110
to get the work done so I do a lot of

564
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:09,509
work at home one of the fuck you know

565
00:27:07,109 --> 00:27:12,928
take that rip and you have like that

566
00:27:09,509 --> 00:27:14,250
speedy coke vibe you know and that's

567
00:27:12,929 --> 00:27:16,530
just like I think that's the canvas

568
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:19,319
plant working in its mysterious ways of

569
00:27:16,529 --> 00:27:20,910
bringing you so high up where you know

570
00:27:19,319 --> 00:27:22,649
some people can't handle it you know

571
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:24,779
it's not for beginners but some people I

572
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:27,420
can handle it I can get so much fucking

573
00:27:24,779 --> 00:28:12,269
work done you know and maybe skip out on

574
00:27:27,420 --> 00:28:16,160
a meal if I have to it's a little fresh

575
00:28:12,269 --> 00:28:16,160
that's cool then again warm

576
00:28:23,549 --> 00:28:34,919
that's just a rosin though I like the

577
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:39,490
hash anymore I have so many flavours

578
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:41,830
coming soon like some my lungs that all

579
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:44,470
like that no one's ever tasted in hash

580
00:28:41,829 --> 00:28:46,059
Florence sometimes be knows if you say

581
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:48,519
you got to buy a pack of seeds and hung

582
00:28:46,059 --> 00:28:51,039
out the hash piano but it's really

583
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:53,589
common to you know get the GMO but to

584
00:28:51,039 --> 00:29:06,879
have something like super unique it's

585
00:28:53,589 --> 00:29:09,119
really it's a good hunt it down yeah

586
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:12,730
yeah everything goes the same exact way

587
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:14,439
it's just different from the harvest you

588
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:16,269
know I don't look at the plant on who's

589
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:21,460
the biggest who yields or who flowers

590
00:29:16,269 --> 00:29:25,230
the fastest it's not that it's the best

591
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:27,789
field with the best chirp best quality

592
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:30,099
you know just overall and then some of

593
00:29:27,789 --> 00:29:32,859
them like always come out different you

594
00:29:30,099 --> 00:29:34,779
know like I say like they're all gonna

595
00:29:32,859 --> 00:29:40,509
come out white or something they have

596
00:29:34,779 --> 00:29:42,519
different tinge is a color from a look

597
00:29:40,509 --> 00:29:45,490
of gold to maybe an even amber you know

598
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:47,440
but it'd still be like wait consider it

599
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:49,390
is the best of the best you know goes

600
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:51,490
through the same process it's just you

601
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:55,800
know different flavors different shades

602
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:55,799
and stuff it's really cool

603
00:29:57,319 --> 00:30:03,980
[Music]

604
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:03,980
I think that Jar
