1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,919
all right gentlemen and ladies uh i'm

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:08,719
going to try to

3
00:00:05,919 --> 00:00:10,960
unteach what you know about soil and

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:14,240
give you a different perspective

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,759
i kind of like to take you out of your

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,480
comfort zone

7
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,359
take you out of your body and mind for a

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,039
minute here

9
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:24,560
and and try to get you to look at things

10
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:27,199
a little differently

11
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:28,320
um what is psychical soil all right yes

12
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,118
there actually is a word

13
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,640
psychical and it's psycho psychic and

14
00:00:31,118 --> 00:00:35,039
physical

15
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,558
and in many ways you know i truly

16
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:39,119
believe that that

17
00:00:36,558 --> 00:00:40,320
soil is something that's beyond our

18
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:44,159
comprehension

19
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:47,520
supernatural paranormal paramagnetic

20
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:49,839
spiritual extra sensory subliminal

21
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,960
subconscious clairvoyant

22
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,239
and in order to take this to another

23
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,960
level i want just

24
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:58,718
talk about the definition of life i

25
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:02,399
struggle a lot with this because

26
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:05,840
you know here we are in 2020

27
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:07,359
and we say a a sperm is alive and an egg

28
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,000
is not

29
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:13,039
i think that our perspective of life and

30
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,438
that definition needs to be revisited

31
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,960
we we say viruses are not alive well

32
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:18,478
viruses have been around since the

33
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:19,759
beginning and they have steered

34
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:22,400
evolution

35
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:24,640
when something gets out of whack the

36
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,840
virus sets in

37
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:30,079
calls the herd to some degree and then

38
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,280
allows a rebirth to come out of the

39
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:34,399
chaos

40
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:36,320
and so again i think that in

41
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,840
in this day and age we should be looking

42
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:40,239
at things uh

43
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,960
have a better perspective on what we

44
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:44,798
define as life and what we define as not

45
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:46,239
alive

46
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,920
one of the other pieces of the puzzle

47
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:49,519
that i really want to talk about is the

48
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,200
fourth phase of water for

49
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:54,239
for you out there please just write that

50
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,879
down in between sessions or

51
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:58,640
tonight or tomorrow whenever google it

52
00:01:56,879 --> 00:01:59,839
um there are there are people out there

53
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:05,040
that are trying to

54
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:06,960
um debunk this understanding or concept

55
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,039
so i don't want you to focus on that i

56
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:11,439
want you to focus on what was written

57
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:13,439
and what has been talked about

58
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:15,439
it's kind of like you know when you take

59
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:17,680
your shoes off and you walk

60
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:19,759
in the sand there's a connection there

61
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,480
the sand just makes you feel good

62
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:23,598
same as rolling around in the grass in

63
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:25,439
in the sunshine

64
00:02:23,598 --> 00:02:27,439
there's there's something going on there

65
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:29,359
there's a connection to

66
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:31,280
the earth through through the moisture

67
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,959
through the water whether it be

68
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,878
a mist or a vapor

69
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,959
there's a connection there and in the

70
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:42,639
fourth phase of water

71
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:45,920
they touch on structured water which i

72
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:48,559
not a big fan of that term i like to

73
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:50,639
think of it more as

74
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,080
understanding the water's ability to

75
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:56,799
transfer

76
00:02:52,080 --> 00:03:00,720
information millivolts

77
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,719
ec electrical conductivity

78
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:04,158
i'm actually reading a paper right now

79
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,239
by a gentleman

80
00:03:04,158 --> 00:03:08,000
his first name uh for slips means but

81
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,000
his last name is bally

82
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,400
and he's actually taken it to a whole

83
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,479
another level i i i'm like

84
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,158
without a way to define it other than

85
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:18,318
it's the fifth level

86
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:20,000
and so some of his work is kind of

87
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:22,799
showing us that

88
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,840
inside a bacteria which is one micron so

89
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,480
you can't see it unless you have a

90
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:29,840
microscope so it's very small

91
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:33,119
there are 3.3 billion

92
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:36,400
water molecules in that single cell

93
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,719
and the way those water molecules line

94
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,120
up

95
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:41,439
allows for information to be transferred

96
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,319
from one part of the cell to the other

97
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:46,079
and so that's kind of the direction that

98
00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:46,958
that i want you to start thinking about

99
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,480
water as well

100
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:53,280
and life i think that these definitions

101
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:54,798
really need to be explored deeper and

102
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,120
hopefully in the next few years we

103
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:56,560
really

104
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,799
start to pay attention to some of this

105
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,799
stuff

106
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,039
so moving on this has always been one of

107
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,480
the funnest questions uh

108
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:06,400
i ask when i'm sitting around with a

109
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:07,840
bunch of nerds or people that are way

110
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,879
smarter than me

111
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,719
and that is uh where does the soil stop

112
00:04:10,878 --> 00:04:16,000
and the plant begin

113
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:19,279
and again this is a conversation that's

114
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,160
that's beyond what most people stop to

115
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:23,119
ponder about

116
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,320
but it's it's an important question and

117
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,240
you know yeah you can grow

118
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:28,478
hydroponically which is in water

119
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,759
but we just talked about water and its

120
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:31,439
properties so

121
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,800
i don't think you can sit there and say

122
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:34,160
that just because you're growing in

123
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,400
water

124
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,320
you're not connected to the soil or the

125
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:40,799
what i want to call the aquatic

126
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:42,399
food web which is very similar to the

127
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,560
soil food web

128
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:46,560
and we'll get into that in more detail

129
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,800
as we as we go forward but

130
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,600
just stop for a second and ponder that

131
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,000
question

132
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,439
you know where where does one stop and

133
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,160
the other begin

134
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:57,918
and it's a it's a deep question and i've

135
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,040
i've stumped a lot of really brilliant

136
00:04:57,918 --> 00:05:00,879
minds with that question

137
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,479
and and made them just you know sit back

138
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:03,199
and go wait a minute i never thought of

139
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:04,959
that

140
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,400
and so it's i think it's an important

141
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:08,000
question to ask yourself especially

142
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:09,839
today as we move through this

143
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,560
you know again i'm trying to get you to

144
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:14,959
think outside the box of what you know

145
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,478
um and in hopes that that i open your

146
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:19,680
mind to some things that perhaps you

147
00:05:16,478 --> 00:05:19,680
hadn't quite thought about yet

148
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:24,000
so what are the properties of soil soil

149
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:27,520
science says

150
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,478
and this this is dogma that that soil is

151
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:31,198
defined

152
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:32,000
by the particulate size and not the

153
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,720
properties

154
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,079
of the particulate and to me you know

155
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,199
that just makes no sense

156
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:39,839
um sand silt and clay all have different

157
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,240
properties

158
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:43,439
if you've ever done a home textural test

159
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,038
where you've taken a

160
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:47,279
handful of your soil and you put it in a

161
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:48,639
mason jar added a little bit of water

162
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:50,239
and shook it up

163
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,240
you will see it settles out differently

164
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,639
the sand settles first clay

165
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,600
second and r excuse me the silt second

166
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,960
and the clay last

167
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,439
and then of course what's floating is

168
00:05:56,959 --> 00:06:01,680
your organic matter so right away

169
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:02,959
the specific gravity of sand silt and

170
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,439
clay and organic matter

171
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:07,279
are all different and we're going to get

172
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:08,959
into specifics on

173
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:11,359
what the properties of each one of these

174
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:13,599
are and that will hopefully get you

175
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,879
to uh start to understand that they're

176
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,919
they're critical components

177
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:20,560
in in growing plants of any kind

178
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:22,719
um so another piece of the puzzle that

179
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:27,199
is not discussed or talked about often

180
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:30,560
is soil is only 50

181
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:31,439
physical matter the other 50 is air and

182
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,439
water

183
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:34,560
and that's where you get anaerobic and

184
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:37,360
aerobic conditions

185
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,800
so in the silt on the bottom of a creek

186
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,879
or a riverbed

187
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,319
is anaerobic you step in it and you pull

188
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:44,478
your foot out and you're covered with

189
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,879
mud that smells pretty nasty so that's

190
00:06:44,478 --> 00:06:48,399
anaerobic and on the other end of the

191
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:50,399
chart you have a desert

192
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:51,839
where you have very little moisture now

193
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:54,399
there is vapor

194
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:56,399
trapped down lower into the sand but

195
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:59,359
it's very aerobic

196
00:06:56,399 --> 00:07:00,239
so it's almost oxidative it's it's

197
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,520
almost like

198
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,240
very difficult for uh that moisture to

199
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:06,240
hang around

200
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,478
and be supportive of plants now there

201
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,560
are some plants that live in deserts but

202
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:12,879
they're pretty scattered and and not a

203
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:16,000
lot of diversity

204
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:18,560
so remember soil is only 50

205
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,639
to physical matter and the other 50 the

206
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,800
water and the air or gas exchange are

207
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:26,000
very very important to support

208
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,000
uh healthy plant life

209
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:32,000
all right so what is sand um there's

210
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,599
really kind of three components to sand

211
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,598
it could either be silica or

212
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:36,800
quartz and i want you to think about

213
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:40,319
that and look at that

214
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:42,478
that molecule uh one part silica

215
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:45,039
two parts oxygen so if you have a

216
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:48,000
bacteria in a soil system that is

217
00:07:45,038 --> 00:07:50,000
uh mining silica for the plant remember

218
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,879
the plant sends down exudates

219
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,399
to target specific bacteria to mine

220
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:56,800
specific things

221
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:59,598
to then make it available for the plant

222
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:02,000
so as that bacterium

223
00:07:59,598 --> 00:08:03,279
pulls up the silica to make it available

224
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,160
for the plant

225
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:07,119
it's releasing oxygen and so this is you

226
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,240
know another

227
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:12,160
key piece to understanding how

228
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,519
these components of soil are so

229
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,000
important in in

230
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:17,758
providing the diversity that you want in

231
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,478
your soil system

232
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,919
i've had people say oh we only need mpk

233
00:08:20,478 --> 00:08:23,758
we've learned that lesson there's

234
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:24,959
way more nutrients than you need just

235
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,319
npk

236
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:28,959
and then i've heard people say oh well

237
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:31,199
there's 17 nutrients

238
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:33,038
yeah you know i think that's

239
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:35,038
narrow-minded i think that

240
00:08:33,038 --> 00:08:36,319
when you start to think about the

241
00:08:35,038 --> 00:08:39,360
biological

242
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:42,479
constituent that goes on and many

243
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:45,440
ways a specific bacteria's

244
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:47,680
main purpose could be just to grow and

245
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:50,240
die off and provide a

246
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:51,439
substrate or a food source for another

247
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,159
bacteria

248
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,839
so every i believe every part of the

249
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:59,120
periodic table is important

250
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:00,080
for advanced life to happen and at some

251
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,480
point in some

252
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,360
time all of these minerals were being

253
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,560
consumed or

254
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:08,800
are continually being consumed

255
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:11,199
just to support the next level advanced

256
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:14,000
life or or evolution

257
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:16,399
um another part of sand can be calcium

258
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,879
carbonate and we all know how valuable

259
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:20,559
calcium is in in our soil system for our

260
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:22,879
plant health

261
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:23,919
yes it's basically fossilized corals and

262
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:26,000
shells

263
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:28,079
now i've got people saying oh well we

264
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,879
can't get calcium carbonate sand

265
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,519
in in the midwest well that's not true

266
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:34,480
um at

267
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:36,639
every at some point in time over the

268
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,159
last billions of years

269
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:40,319
everything has been underwater

270
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:43,759
everything has had uh

271
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,600
a ocean a sea uh a shallow

272
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:47,200
amount of water over the top of it that

273
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,800
allowed

274
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:54,640
some type of crustacean to exist

275
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:56,559
so all it takes is is erosion um

276
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:57,679
and water movement and in some cases

277
00:09:56,559 --> 00:10:01,439
just wind

278
00:09:57,679 --> 00:10:03,838
uh to to expose that kind of material

279
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,720
and you know i i think that another

280
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:09,519
great misnomer is the understanding that

281
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,920
the vast majority of soil on this planet

282
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:14,240
i believe it's about 80

283
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:16,319
was moved through transportation or was

284
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:19,600
formed through transportation so

285
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:22,320
the wind the water uh the sun

286
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:24,320
sun heating it up and and the water

287
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,000
freezing and breaking it apart

288
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,320
so all these things are part of the

289
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,039
process of of forming soil and

290
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,000
soil often took thousands if not

291
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:35,039
millions of years to

292
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,839
form in the layers that it did

293
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:40,480
so keep that in mind as well the other

294
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,200
type is diatomaceous earth or diatoms

295
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,519
and

296
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,720
who those of you who have heard me speak

297
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,799
in the past

298
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,240
i'm all about diatoms i think that they

299
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:50,078
are very

300
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,519
in many ways the missing link in our

301
00:10:50,078 --> 00:10:54,239
healthy soil system

302
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,639
at this point in time in before the

303
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,680
great

304
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:59,039
expansion of humanity all the rivers and

305
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:01,439
creeks and lakes had

306
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:02,799
you know herds massive herds of animals

307
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,600
running through them

308
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:06,879
dragging up all of the aquatic food web

309
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,759
including diatoms

310
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:11,838
up onto the land think about migratory

311
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:15,838
birds i mean there's stories and

312
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:19,120
pictures of the late 1800s where

313
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:20,720
in the carolinas the the sky darkened

314
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,919
with the migration of these

315
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,879
uh geese and ducks and those migrated

316
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:27,360
all over the country

317
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:28,720
so as they took off and landed to eat

318
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,959
grass all of the

319
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:33,278
the aquatic soil food web and diatoms

320
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:35,039
were spread across the soil system

321
00:11:33,278 --> 00:11:36,720
and of course nowadays we don't have

322
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:37,759
those massive herds or those massive

323
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,759
migrations

324
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:41,439
so in many ways the diatoms and the

325
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:42,000
other parts of the aquatic food web are

326
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,519
not getting

327
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:48,720
up on the soil now a quick little

328
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:49,440
flashback and nasa did a study in 2011

329
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,399
about the

330
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:54,240
dust storms in the sahara desert and

331
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:55,839
what they determined was that that dust

332
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,278
went all the way up into the upper

333
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:59,920
atmosphere

334
00:11:57,278 --> 00:12:00,799
floated across the ocean uh the atlantic

335
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:03,599
ocean

336
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:04,240
and reformed into particulate that

337
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,120
rained down

338
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,399
on the amazon rainforest and that study

339
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,919
indicated that

340
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:13,039
they believed it was providing

341
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:14,639
phosphorus for for the amazon rainforest

342
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:16,480
um another study that was done i believe

343
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:18,320
in 2017

344
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,079
where they took it a little bit further

345
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,360
and they realized that it was really

346
00:12:20,078 --> 00:12:24,559
diatom shells

347
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:26,399
as well as some of some silica sands um

348
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:28,159
that were raining down on the amazon

349
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:31,039
rainforest and so

350
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:32,319
now the theory is it's more fertilizing

351
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:34,958
the system

352
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,240
so again you know these these diatoms

353
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:39,599
are very important

354
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:41,200
um in in the whole ecosystem

355
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,519
and i want to touch on diatomaceous

356
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:47,120
earth for a minute now that is where

357
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:50,959
diatoms have been collected or mined

358
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:52,399
specifically if you look at

359
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:54,879
some of the interesting satellite

360
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:57,120
photography about the glaciers melting

361
00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:58,799
you will see these huge plumes of

362
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,919
diatoms happening where that

363
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:03,679
mineral rich water hits the ocean and

364
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:05,039
so they bloom out they they grow they

365
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:07,199
grow they grow until those

366
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:09,120
that minerals are depleted they die off

367
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,759
and they leave a huge layer

368
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,480
of diet to diatomaceous earth on the sea

369
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:14,879
floor

370
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,680
and then as the continents move and

371
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:17,919
drift of course

372
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:20,159
you know billions of years eventually

373
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:20,719
those pockets of diatoms end up on the

374
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:23,199
surface

375
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,480
of the earth instead of underneath deep

376
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,839
water

377
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:30,560
now people use diatomaceous earth as a

378
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:33,839
insecticide and it does have pretty

379
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:35,919
effective properties a quick story of

380
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:38,880
when i was young i got to tour a uh

381
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:40,639
a glass manufacturing plant uh foster

382
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:42,480
forbes uh glass you know i think it was

383
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:45,839
hopedale massachusetts

384
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:48,000
and out back there was this huge pile of

385
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:49,519
glass that had you know either screwed

386
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,799
up and then dumped on the floor

387
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:52,560
or bottles that weren't quite

388
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:54,078
manufactured correctly

389
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:55,679
and they would just throw them back out

390
00:13:54,078 --> 00:13:57,679
in this giant pile

391
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:59,759
and then pull from that as they needed

392
00:13:57,679 --> 00:14:01,120
it to to recycle it back into the glass

393
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:02,799
production system

394
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,240
and we laughed about like what it would

395
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:04,799
what torture it would be if you were

396
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,560
forced to

397
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:08,719
you know climb up over the top of this

398
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:11,359
mountain and down the other side

399
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:13,519
what would be left of you and so that's

400
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,320
basically what diatomaceous earth does

401
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,799
to

402
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,399
uh micro and macro orthopods it

403
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:20,958
basically cuts them up

404
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:23,440
and shreds them and so i've had people

405
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:25,119
to pass say well i want to amend my soil

406
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:28,000
with diatomaceous earth and i'm like

407
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,120
well i don't think that's a great idea a

408
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,879
little bit is okay

409
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,240
but if you start using a bunch of it you

410
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:35,278
are going to restrict

411
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:36,879
the ability for that soil system the

412
00:14:35,278 --> 00:14:37,838
soil food web to function at its full

413
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:41,278
capacity

414
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:42,800
in other words if a nematode brushes up

415
00:14:41,278 --> 00:14:44,480
against one of those it's gonna it's

416
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:46,159
gonna get cut open

417
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,399
and same with some of these uh

418
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:50,639
microorthopods that are beneficial

419
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:52,078
you're going to lose them so again you

420
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:55,039
know everything in moderation

421
00:14:52,078 --> 00:14:56,638
a little bit is okay preferably get live

422
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:58,559
diatoms

423
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:00,320
and we will be talking about those at

424
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:03,119
length in the january session

425
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,240
and how to wildcraft them or and or grow

426
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,799
them out

427
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,079
and so in that case you're providing a

428
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:10,319
living animal

429
00:15:08,078 --> 00:15:11,759
into your soil system and again that the

430
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,920
interesting thing about

431
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:16,319
diatoms are is they actually produce

432
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:18,000
oxygen that is their off gas

433
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,240
so if you put them down in your soil

434
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,198
system you're feeding oxygen

435
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,079
directly to the soil food web that's

436
00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:26,319
underground

437
00:15:24,078 --> 00:15:28,479
and and will consume that oxygen and

438
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,160
release co2 for the plant so again

439
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:33,440
you're you're assisting

440
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:34,719
in um the gaseous uh exchange or gas

441
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,440
exchange system

442
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:39,120
um that that functions perfectly with

443
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,800
with plants

444
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,480
another interesting thing about diatoms

445
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:45,679
is they have a biogenetic

446
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:48,480
bond not a covalent not an ionic so

447
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:49,599
a biogenetic bond is easier uh to be

448
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,000
broken apart

449
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:54,639
and therefore again now you're mining

450
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,399
silica and other minerals and nutrients

451
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:59,680
a lot easier than perhaps trying to

452
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:59,679
digest a grain of sand

453
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,159
silt all right silt holds a negative

454
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,440
charge and here again here's the dogma

455
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:10,719
of

456
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:12,000
soil science and sand does not hold a

457
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,399
charge

458
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,480
but silt does so why are they defined by

459
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:18,159
particulate size

460
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,600
another interesting piece of

461
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:22,159
understanding

462
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:24,560
why it's valuable to have a paramagnetic

463
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:26,480
charge in the soil

464
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:28,399
think about how you can attract

465
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,399
nutrients and store nutrients

466
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:31,919
so that they're not mobile in the in the

467
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:33,360
soil profile

468
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:35,439
well a negative charge will help

469
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:38,879
tremendously in holding a

470
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:42,480
anion or excuse me a cation

471
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:45,759
so positives and negatives attract

472
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:48,399
the same positive positives repel

473
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:49,440
so if it's holding a negative charge

474
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:51,839
then it's going to be

475
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,120
attracting a cation and we'll get into

476
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:56,000
the specifics of that

477
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,278
in another slide or two but also another

478
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,120
piece of this to think about

479
00:16:57,278 --> 00:17:01,120
is that how do you form aggregates and

480
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,799
aggregates are the key piece to a

481
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,199
healthy soil system

482
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:07,038
aggregates are formed generally through

483
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:08,318
either a positive and negative charge

484
00:17:07,038 --> 00:17:10,959
helping to start

485
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:11,759
attracting particulate together and then

486
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:14,160
the next level

487
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:16,078
is what happens with bacteria they

488
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,839
create a biofilm

489
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:20,078
which helps to bond these particulates

490
00:17:17,838 --> 00:17:20,879
together and on the fungi kingdom it's

491
00:17:20,078 --> 00:17:23,038
glomulin

492
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:25,360
it's another form of natural glue that

493
00:17:23,038 --> 00:17:27,679
will help bond things together

494
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:29,599
and in understanding the physical

495
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,640
properties of soil and remembering that

496
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:33,279
only 50

497
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,559
of that is physical and the other 50 is

498
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:35,839
water and air

499
00:17:34,558 --> 00:17:38,639
it's really important to have that

500
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:41,839
aggregation so that water can infiltrate

501
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,400
and gas can exchange so aggregations is

502
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:44,959
critical

503
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:47,519
and and silt is a big piece of helping

504
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:49,120
to form aggregates micro and macro in

505
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:50,240
your soil system

506
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:52,159
another thing that can take into

507
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,960
consideration is silt is an organic

508
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,160
matter

509
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:59,840
it just happens to be uh very fine

510
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,960
so what comes after silt would be humus

511
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:03,279
and then humates

512
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,480
and then umic acids are which are a part

513
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:07,678
of humate

514
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:10,000
process and so you're again providing a

515
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,519
very valuable nutrient in your soil

516
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,839
system when you do include

517
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:15,839
silt as part of your soil recipe

518
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:23,279
clay is one of my favorite um i

519
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,080
will bounce back to when i was a kid uh

520
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:26,960
we used to

521
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:27,439
mine clay on the side of a hill on a

522
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,240
road

523
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,640
and we'd get this uh really white almost

524
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,200
like

525
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:35,600
uh anyone out there who's painted and

526
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:37,279
used white paint if you put just a tiny

527
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:39,359
drop of purple in there

528
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:40,879
you get like a three-dimensional white

529
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:43,839
color and so

530
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,559
primary clay is white or this kind of

531
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:47,759
like

532
00:18:44,558 --> 00:18:48,079
uh interesting color of white not not

533
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:51,519
just

534
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:53,839
flat white has some depth to it and

535
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:54,960
primary clay has very little minerals or

536
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:57,759
nutrients it does

537
00:18:54,960 --> 00:19:00,240
does have a charge but again it's not as

538
00:18:57,759 --> 00:19:02,400
valuable as some of these colored clays

539
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,400
i've seen blue clay i've seen green clay

540
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:07,280
i've seen red clay i've seen brown clay

541
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,240
and i'm sure you all have too and the

542
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:10,720
beauty of clay

543
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,720
is that it's both negatively and

544
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,240
positively charged which i will

545
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:17,120
get into in a minute but more

546
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:19,759
importantly backing up

547
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:22,000
clay expands when it gets wet so it has

548
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:24,480
a water holding capacity

549
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
and it also contracts when it dries out

550
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,679
and that contraction can

551
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:32,160
can cause problems um and compaction

552
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:34,240
so when if you look at the center of the

553
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,080
slide you'll see how the clay platelets

554
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,400
stand up on top of each other

555
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:40,480
the outside edge is positively charged

556
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,200
and and the flat surface is negatively

557
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,919
charged

558
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:46,080
so imagine if you took the piece to your

559
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:47,120
left and stacked it up on top of that

560
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:49,119
other

561
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:51,038
clay platelet that's upright now you

562
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:54,798
would form what would i would call

563
00:19:51,038 --> 00:19:56,879
an eye shape and some of the interesting

564
00:19:54,798 --> 00:19:58,000
studies i've been reading on is that

565
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,640
that little

566
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,720
c-shaped negatively charged or

567
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:06,000
paramagnetically charged

568
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:09,120
area is attracting guess what

569
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,919
cations so those are nutrients so if you

570
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:12,399
stack these

571
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:14,159
up on top of on themselves indefinitely

572
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:17,519
which is what you will have

573
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:19,520
in a healthy soil system

574
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:22,158
think of all of the potential nutrient

575
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:23,599
holding capacity clay provides

576
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:26,320
again it's not mobile it's not going to

577
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:29,918
wash away and as those root tips

578
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:31,759
and root hairs hit those areas

579
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:33,600
they can actually pull those nutrients

580
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:35,119
out and they're they're

581
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:37,519
essentially plant available they have

582
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:40,479
been processed at that point

583
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:41,679
um and again clay helps in building

584
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,720
irrigation which is

585
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:46,240
the critical piece to that gas exchange

586
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,759
water infiltration water holding

587
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,759
capacity

588
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:53,119
now let's let's talk a little bit more

589
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:56,319
about the clay platelet and cec

590
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:59,439
cec is is the measurement of of

591
00:20:56,319 --> 00:21:01,918
three primary nutrients calcium

592
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,519
magnesium and potassium and i know a lot

593
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:04,240
of cannabis growers in the past were

594
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:06,720
always oh

595
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,640
cal mag cal mag deficiency well it

596
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,440
really isn't cow mag deficiency it's

597
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,480
calmag

598
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:14,798
and potassium if these are out of whack

599
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:17,599
you're not going to have what would be

600
00:21:14,798 --> 00:21:19,759
considered a perfect healthy soil system

601
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:21,359
as far as these nutrients are concerned

602
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:23,599
there's a lot of tests that that you can

603
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:25,759
do but this is one that has been

604
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:27,918
for the most part overlooked it's called

605
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:30,480
the saturated pace test

606
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:31,840
now there's a hundred parking spots on

607
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:35,599
on a piece of clay

608
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:38,158
and in an ideal situation you have 75

609
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:39,038
parking spots filled with calcium you

610
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:41,039
have 18

611
00:21:39,038 --> 00:21:42,240
parkits parking spots filled with

612
00:21:41,038 --> 00:21:44,879
magnesium

613
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,440
and you have seven parking spots filled

614
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,960
with

615
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:51,600
potassium that equals a hundred and

616
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,480
that's what the saturated paste test is

617
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:55,759
measuring for you

618
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:58,159
is the understanding of how well your

619
00:21:55,759 --> 00:22:00,158
nutrients are balanced within or your

620
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:02,720
your cat ions are balanced within

621
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:04,080
within your soil system so clay provides

622
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:07,440
that and so

623
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:09,119
if you're building a if you're building

624
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:12,720
a soil system

625
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:13,678
then to not include clay in my mind is a

626
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,038
mistake

627
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:17,759
and i understand a lot of people are

628
00:22:15,038 --> 00:22:18,640
scared of clay heavily clay soils are

629
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:20,798
difficult to grow

630
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,919
in they're nowhere near as hard to grow

631
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:24,558
in as sand is

632
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:26,000
trust me on that um but there's issues

633
00:22:24,558 --> 00:22:29,279
with clay that

634
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,759
if they're compacted or dried out

635
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:33,440
or heavily saturated then they can erode

636
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:35,279
they can create anaerobic pockets they

637
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:38,000
can collapse and compact and

638
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:38,558
not allow gas exchange so i'm not saying

639
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,400
use

640
00:22:38,558 --> 00:22:42,000
you know a ton of clay but there is a

641
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,080
formula that i've come up with and

642
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,519
i'll talk about it in a little bit um

643
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:48,079
about how to use clay

644
00:22:45,519 --> 00:22:49,679
in your soil system without having these

645
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:53,199
kinds of compaction

646
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:54,000
um and and water storage issues that can

647
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,600
come

648
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,319
into play if you have a very heavily

649
00:22:55,599 --> 00:22:58,319
clad soil

650
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,679
so organic matter all right so this is

651
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,279
the last of the four parts fraction

652
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:06,960
all right sand silk clay and organic

653
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:08,798
matter those those are what make up all

654
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:11,038
soils

655
00:23:08,798 --> 00:23:13,200
organic matter we call it soil organic

656
00:23:11,038 --> 00:23:16,400
matter som

657
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:19,120
is critical in fertility it's

658
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:21,038
it's a source of all nutrients because

659
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:23,199
all plants pull different nutrients

660
00:23:21,038 --> 00:23:24,720
and as they break down they make soil

661
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,679
organic matter

662
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,960
and so if you do not have a lot of soil

663
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:30,798
organic matter

664
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,400
in your soil system then your fertility

665
00:23:30,798 --> 00:23:34,319
is somewhat of an issue

666
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,759
and you know ironically i'm bouncing

667
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:37,599
around here a little bit but

668
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:40,240
traditionally it's considered to be a

669
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:43,278
very healthy fertile soil if you

670
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:44,319
have five to eight percent um soil

671
00:23:43,278 --> 00:23:47,679
organic matter

672
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:48,480
in your uh farm and personally i think

673
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:50,320
that's low

674
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:53,440
i mean i've i've done a lot of soil

675
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:55,119
engineering in the past and i did push

676
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,480
the limits a little too far on one

677
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:58,479
particular project

678
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,400
it was it was okay i was experimenting

679
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,079
with some

680
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,840
architectural plants that should never

681
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:05,359
be planted together and i was trying to

682
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:07,199
balance it out so that a

683
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:08,479
swamp maple could be grown right around

684
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,240
boxwoods

685
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,079
and so i used a tremendous amount of

686
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,278
soil organic matter to hold that

687
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:16,240
moisture in

688
00:24:13,278 --> 00:24:17,278
and lock it in around the roots of the

689
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,440
swamp maple

690
00:24:17,278 --> 00:24:20,319
and then used a lot of sand outside of

691
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,320
that

692
00:24:20,319 --> 00:24:24,158
to help drain the boxwood so that they

693
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:26,558
didn't have root rot

694
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:28,400
and what i came up with um after the

695
00:24:26,558 --> 00:24:28,639
fact we went back and looked at the soil

696
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,360
and

697
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,720
it was very gummy and and sticky and

698
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:35,759
basically what that is

699
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:38,240
that's the biology doing their job but

700
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:39,278
it can become an issue uh in a situation

701
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,679
where if you over

702
00:24:39,278 --> 00:24:43,119
water you're gonna go anaerobic and in

703
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:43,600
this particular case that's what

704
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:45,678
happened

705
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:48,158
the tree started to suffer so we went

706
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:50,159
back in there analyzed the irrigation

707
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:52,480
we actually removed tremendous amount of

708
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:54,480
drip around the base of the tree

709
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,159
and only had one small strip so that

710
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,480
when the watering came on

711
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:00,640
it was not putting as much water into

712
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,960
that swamp maples uh

713
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,960
soil profile to avoid that that

714
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,840
anaerobic condition and it worked it was

715
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,759
fine

716
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:09,278
but there is again there's there's a

717
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:11,440
limit to everything and you don't want

718
00:25:09,278 --> 00:25:13,278
to get into a position where you have

719
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,640
stepped over the boundaries and and

720
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:16,240
you're going to cause yourself further

721
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,960
problems because you didn't

722
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:21,120
you did you were in excess of something

723
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:23,200
so on the right you can see

724
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:24,639
what actually soil organic matter is

725
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,558
composed of

726
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,799
carbon which we all know is a very

727
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:32,639
important food source for

728
00:25:28,798 --> 00:25:33,519
microbes and and also oxygen i mean look

729
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,840
at the percentage

730
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:37,200
it's it's pretty much carbon and oxygen

731
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:39,278
with a little bit of hydrogen

732
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,278
a little bit of nitrogen now i want you

733
00:25:39,278 --> 00:25:43,440
to flip these around and look at

734
00:25:41,278 --> 00:25:45,440
nitrogen or carbon and nitrogen it's

735
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:49,038
called c to n ratio it's an important

736
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:50,640
uh other measurement uh for maturity and

737
00:25:49,038 --> 00:25:52,640
we will get into that uh

738
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,640
in another slide but it also is the

739
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,720
foundation of life everything has carbon

740
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:58,240
and nitrogen to a ratio

741
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,079
and then in the middle you have oxygen

742
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,839
hydrogen we all know when

743
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:04,399
hydrogen and oxygen get together you

744
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:05,359
have water so essentially soil soil

745
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,840
organic matter

746
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:08,479
is the food source it has the carbon to

747
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:10,798
nitrogen

748
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:12,159
as well as the oxygen to hydrogen it's

749
00:26:10,798 --> 00:26:15,759
everything that you need

750
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:17,840
for to support life so again

751
00:26:15,759 --> 00:26:20,400
you know i want you to start looking at

752
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:23,759
these constituents these pieces

753
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:27,120
of the soil system in a different light

754
00:26:23,759 --> 00:26:29,200
it kind of you know this is this is why

755
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:30,158
things function so well when they're not

756
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:33,360
disturbed

757
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:36,640
uh or not um overused or abused

758
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:38,319
and unfortunately we have done horrible

759
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,600
damage to the surface of the earth the

760
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:42,000
living skin

761
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:43,119
but we can start to fix that and and

762
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,599
specifically

763
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:47,119
you know in in cannabis growing on

764
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:49,278
cannabis production

765
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:50,959
you want to have these pieces in play

766
00:26:49,278 --> 00:26:52,960
and you don't want to be in just a

767
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,960
soilless medium anymore i think that you

768
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,640
know we've all learned that

769
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,240
there are better ways and we just have

770
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,520
to get out of our own way and start

771
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,440
thinking that there are

772
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:03,839
better methods and techniques if we

773
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:05,360
biomimic nature in other words copy what

774
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:08,399
nature has already shown us

775
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:08,399
is extremely effective

776
00:27:09,278 --> 00:27:15,919
soil horizons i first introduced this

777
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,919
about four years ago

778
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,599
at the conference that daniel was

779
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:22,720
referring to and i

780
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:25,199
pretty much got laughed off the stage uh

781
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,839
candace gross didn't get this and i

782
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,399
think now

783
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:30,398
after four years um shango louis love

784
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:31,759
him adapted a podcast on this and it

785
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:34,079
kind of opened people's minds up that

786
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:35,278
hey maybe this is a better way and the

787
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:36,000
people that i've worked with and

788
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:39,119
consulted

789
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
and or explained this to who have used

790
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:42,319
this technique

791
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,599
um have had great success with it it's

792
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:45,439
prevented them from

793
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:46,959
over watering and underwatering it's

794
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,880
taken a curve out of

795
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,640
you know having hydrophobic soils or

796
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:54,000
anaerobic conditions

797
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:56,399
so it really is again a better method to

798
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,640
to growing a plant especially a heavy

799
00:27:56,398 --> 00:28:00,959
eater like like cannabis

800
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,799
so at the top of the screen we have the

801
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,679
o horizon and that's traditionally would

802
00:28:02,798 --> 00:28:06,720
be considered as

803
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:08,798
uh or uh soilless medium so it's all

804
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:11,839
just pure organic matter

805
00:28:08,798 --> 00:28:12,079
the a horizon is the critical one um the

806
00:28:11,839 --> 00:28:14,398
a

807
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:15,519
horizon helps to mitigate excess

808
00:28:14,398 --> 00:28:18,079
moisture

809
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:18,960
that is put on the organic matter and

810
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:21,678
lets it drain

811
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:23,919
down in throughout the a horizon where

812
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:26,480
some of it's stored and any excess

813
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:27,520
is again allowed to escape down into the

814
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,519
e horizon

815
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:30,960
i have the b horizon in here because i

816
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:31,359
wanted you to understand that there are

817
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,079
many

818
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:35,278
other horizons but for the most part on

819
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:37,599
the right you will see

820
00:28:35,278 --> 00:28:40,000
oae and that's the ones that i really

821
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:42,879
want to focus on today

822
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,440
so let me explain a little bit more

823
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,480
about

824
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:49,600
how this system works um traditionally

825
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:53,919
in you know the early

826
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:56,319
you know 16 1500s a lot of uh

827
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:58,159
wealthy kings were starting to do

828
00:28:56,319 --> 00:29:00,158
amazing topiary

829
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:03,520
where they were growing these plants in

830
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:05,520
pots and making incredible shapes and

831
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:07,519
sculptures out of these living plants

832
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:08,158
and one of the most important parts that

833
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:10,480
they did

834
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:12,320
was to add a drainage layer at the

835
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:14,000
bottom of the pot

836
00:29:12,319 --> 00:29:15,918
a good old friend of mine who's since

837
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,640
passed

838
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:20,880
wallace gray who actually did floral

839
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:22,559
decorations for the queen of england

840
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,399
and he had pictures of these things i

841
00:29:22,558 --> 00:29:26,879
mean they were like 12 feet tall

842
00:29:24,398 --> 00:29:27,839
and they were all wire and and fresh

843
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,240
flowers

844
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:32,079
that he was would be assembling um when

845
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,960
the queen had dignitaries coming into

846
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:35,439
town

847
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:37,120
and he used to talk about um how he

848
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,519
potted everything and he would take his

849
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:40,479
old

850
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:41,839
spent clay pots that were cracked or or

851
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,200
chipped and he'd smash them up and put

852
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:45,678
them in the bottom of the pot

853
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,480
essentially creating a new horizon and i

854
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:48,240
think so

855
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:50,880
this tech has been around for a long

856
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,919
time but it has not been brought into

857
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:54,960
mainstream

858
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:57,600
uh especially in plant production um

859
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,640
here in the us for the most part so the

860
00:29:57,599 --> 00:30:02,558
e horizon

861
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:05,440
or that smashed up clay allows an area

862
00:30:02,558 --> 00:30:07,359
to store water and when i recommend

863
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:10,080
people build an e horizon i tell them

864
00:30:07,359 --> 00:30:12,479
all right if you're in an 18 inch pot

865
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:14,240
you want about a two to three inch e

866
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,519
horizon so that means you want to use

867
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:18,880
rocks the size

868
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:19,519
two inches no bigger and put them into

869
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,120
the layer

870
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:23,278
to put them in the bottom of the pot to

871
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:24,959
between two and a half and three inches

872
00:30:23,278 --> 00:30:26,960
and then i want you to take a coarse

873
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:30,000
sand and by course i mean

874
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:31,759
not super coarse but not super fine not

875
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,079
that white powdery stuff

876
00:30:31,759 --> 00:30:35,759
that is that's that stuff is problematic

877
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:37,199
you want to look toward a medium

878
00:30:35,759 --> 00:30:40,319
particulate size

879
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:43,759
it should be gray or amber or

880
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:46,398
yellow or taupe that indicates a good

881
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:47,839
mineral content like the calcium

882
00:30:46,398 --> 00:30:51,359
carbonate

883
00:30:47,839 --> 00:30:51,839
and you basically pour the sand in there

884
00:30:51,359 --> 00:30:53,839
and

885
00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:55,439
water it and pack it down until you're

886
00:30:53,839 --> 00:30:57,439
at the right height

887
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:59,840
again two and a half to three inches

888
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:01,840
then the next layer on top of that

889
00:30:59,839 --> 00:31:03,678
is the a horizon and as you can see on

890
00:31:01,839 --> 00:31:07,439
the bottom left you see

891
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:08,559
3o 2a 1e and this is the formula this is

892
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,399
the ratio

893
00:31:08,558 --> 00:31:12,000
so again your 18 inch deep pot you've

894
00:31:10,398 --> 00:31:12,879
used up two and a half to three inches

895
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,599
so your

896
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:16,960
a horizon is going to be about five

897
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:20,000
inches

898
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:20,720
and that is going to be a percentage of

899
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,240
50

900
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:27,519
sand 17 clay 13

901
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:28,798
silt 20 organic matter so it's still

902
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:32,558
going to be providing you

903
00:31:28,798 --> 00:31:34,879
quite a bit of of fluffy soil that the

904
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:38,158
roots can easily penetrate

905
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:40,559
but more importantly that blend is

906
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:41,360
works perfectly with wicking excess

907
00:31:40,558 --> 00:31:43,759
moisture

908
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:44,719
or or lack of moisture up out of the e

909
00:31:43,759 --> 00:31:47,038
horizon and

910
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:49,038
pushing it back up into the ovaries and

911
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:49,359
and vice versa if you have excess water

912
00:31:49,038 --> 00:31:51,759
in the

913
00:31:49,359 --> 00:31:52,398
horizon the a horizon will wick it back

914
00:31:51,759 --> 00:31:54,558
down

915
00:31:52,398 --> 00:31:56,319
and get rid of any excess into the e

916
00:31:54,558 --> 00:31:58,960
horizon and store it

917
00:31:56,319 --> 00:32:01,119
now the critical piece of that sand

918
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:04,240
being used in the e horizon

919
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:06,959
it prevents fines from migrating down

920
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:08,079
and creating an anaerobic pocket if too

921
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:11,278
much

922
00:32:08,079 --> 00:32:14,480
organic matter gets down into that water

923
00:32:11,278 --> 00:32:17,278
what happens is that the bacteria

924
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:17,679
start to mine that organic matter and

925
00:32:17,278 --> 00:32:20,720
they're

926
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:22,559
chewing up oxygen and therefore you're

927
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,919
actually getting into a situation where

928
00:32:22,558 --> 00:32:27,918
you're getting a

929
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:29,519
low oxygen water uh and or low dissolved

930
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:32,720
oxygen in your water

931
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:32,720
which is problematic

932
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:37,360
so that sand actually is what we call a

933
00:32:35,839 --> 00:32:40,639
sand filter and if any

934
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:44,000
of you have had uh fish or or you know

935
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:45,519
um like a pond outside a water feature

936
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,960
generally you'll have some kind of

937
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:48,480
filtration system

938
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:50,319
and a lot of time it's what's called a

939
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:52,720
sand filter so it pulls

940
00:32:50,319 --> 00:32:54,000
uh the what we call the turbidity or

941
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,759
suspended particles

942
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,759
out of the water leaving you with a

943
00:32:55,759 --> 00:33:00,158
crystal clear water source for

944
00:32:57,759 --> 00:33:02,319
for your water feature your fish tank so

945
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:02,640
that that sand is a critical component

946
00:33:02,319 --> 00:33:04,558
to

947
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:06,000
preventing that organic matter from

948
00:33:04,558 --> 00:33:06,960
getting down in there and causing

949
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,720
problems

950
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:11,038
but remember as the organic matter

951
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:14,159
breaks down it turns into

952
00:33:11,038 --> 00:33:16,240
an organic acid which is good because

953
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:17,600
that acid does get down into that water

954
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:21,120
system and again

955
00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:24,240
suspends or or slows down the biological

956
00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:25,599
activity when in the past when i was uh

957
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:28,558
figuring out how to

958
00:33:25,599 --> 00:33:30,240
deliver biology to people uh in a

959
00:33:28,558 --> 00:33:31,839
shelf-stable manner one of the things we

960
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,278
did was play around with what's called a

961
00:33:31,839 --> 00:33:35,839
ph suspension

962
00:33:33,278 --> 00:33:37,599
so that's using a very low ph or very

963
00:33:35,839 --> 00:33:40,000
high ph

964
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:41,599
different compounds to to get that ph

965
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,319
down low enough that

966
00:33:41,599 --> 00:33:46,879
you don't have um a problem with the

967
00:33:44,319 --> 00:33:49,918
organisms going anaerobic

968
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:52,480
um so

969
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:54,159
keeping that in mind that that organic

970
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:57,599
acid will help support

971
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:59,840
or or mitigate excess biology

972
00:33:57,599 --> 00:34:01,839
and again it's allowed to get down into

973
00:33:59,839 --> 00:34:04,240
that soil profile

974
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:05,359
through because it's very small and and

975
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:08,239
it's liquid

976
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:08,960
and that will help to maintain that

977
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:10,799
minimal

978
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:12,240
biological life in the bottom of that

979
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,679
pot so

980
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:15,439
now we have the ovaries and the o

981
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:17,760
horizon is what's considered or

982
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,639
typically you guys call your soilless

983
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:21,520
medium

984
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:23,599
or your super soils and so we have three

985
00:34:21,519 --> 00:34:25,918
parts of that organic matter at the top

986
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:28,480
so we have explosive root growth

987
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:30,078
we have nutrient storing we have gas

988
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:32,320
exchange

989
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:33,440
out of the gate now eventually what's

990
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:36,000
going to happen is this

991
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:37,440
system will aggregate up and that's now

992
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,398
you're on the next level

993
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:42,079
but in order for you to get a positive

994
00:34:40,398 --> 00:34:43,358
first run

995
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:45,359
this is kind of the way you're going to

996
00:34:43,358 --> 00:34:47,279
have to do it because if you

997
00:34:45,358 --> 00:34:48,719
if you just plant into potting soil and

998
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,839
we'll get we'll get into that in further

999
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:51,678
detail

1000
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:53,199
and i'll explain the complications with

1001
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:55,358
just doing that so

1002
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:56,960
think about soil horizons as you you

1003
00:34:55,358 --> 00:34:58,400
know move forward in your life and

1004
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:01,280
you're starting to

1005
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:02,000
you know either add on more beds or

1006
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:04,560
you're going to

1007
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,400
you know you're taking over facility you

1008
00:35:04,559 --> 00:35:07,599
grow you want to set up an indoor grow

1009
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,480
these these are the things that you

1010
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:10,480
should be thinking about

1011
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:16,159
micro and macro aggregates all right

1012
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:19,760
what are they well

1013
00:35:16,159 --> 00:35:22,879
they are the function of soil and

1014
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:26,000
we now know that the inside of a

1015
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:28,240
aggregate is most likely positive

1016
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,358
or negatively charged and the outside is

1017
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:31,439
opposite

1018
00:35:29,358 --> 00:35:33,279
and then that charge is gradated from

1019
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,679
the outside to the inside

1020
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:37,680
and why is that important well again we

1021
00:35:35,679 --> 00:35:40,399
know that magnets attract things

1022
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:41,519
those cations and anions so that's

1023
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:44,639
basically again

1024
00:35:41,519 --> 00:35:46,320
nutrient storage capacity and also if

1025
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:48,000
you look at the pictures you can see how

1026
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,480
there's little pockets there's there's

1027
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,280
air

1028
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:52,000
spaces there's pores for moisture or

1029
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:55,280
water

1030
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,639
to get down into it when i do consulting

1031
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:58,160
a lot of times the first thing i'll do

1032
00:35:56,639 --> 00:36:00,239
is an infiltration test

1033
00:35:58,159 --> 00:36:01,358
to see how well water can infiltrate

1034
00:36:00,239 --> 00:36:04,078
into your soil

1035
00:36:01,358 --> 00:36:04,880
if it can't infiltrate in then it then

1036
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:08,000
it washes

1037
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:10,320
soil away it's called erosion and so

1038
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:13,199
that's why aggregation is so important

1039
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,838
it really provides that next level of

1040
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:17,679
function

1041
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:20,400
in a soil system again soil is only 50

1042
00:36:17,679 --> 00:36:21,679
physical the other 50 is its ability to

1043
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:24,639
hold moisture

1044
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:26,480
and and have gas exchange so that's

1045
00:36:24,639 --> 00:36:28,078
that's the critical part that you you

1046
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:30,559
need to keep in mind

1047
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:32,560
now everything starts with a micro

1048
00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:34,880
aggregate but again the outside is

1049
00:36:32,559 --> 00:36:37,440
either negatively or positively charged

1050
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:39,599
well guess what two micro aggregates can

1051
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:41,760
come together magnetically

1052
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:44,160
and then the biology sets up its glues

1053
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:46,960
whether it's the glomulin from the fungi

1054
00:36:44,159 --> 00:36:48,559
or the biofilm from the bacteria and now

1055
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:50,720
those two microaggregates are starting

1056
00:36:48,559 --> 00:36:52,880
to form into a macro aggregate

1057
00:36:50,719 --> 00:36:54,879
so it's a combination of both the

1058
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:57,680
paramagnetic

1059
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:59,039
charge as well as the biology that are

1060
00:36:57,679 --> 00:37:00,719
that are really creating these

1061
00:36:59,039 --> 00:37:04,480
aggregates and and moving them

1062
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:07,118
into bigger and bigger components

1063
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:08,240
um recently i've started using the word

1064
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:10,000
ryo sheath

1065
00:37:08,239 --> 00:37:11,759
and i think everybody knows what this is

1066
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,719
anyone who's not walked outside

1067
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,960
picked a weed and there's this big clump

1068
00:37:14,719 --> 00:37:16,799
or

1069
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:18,800
ball around the root base well

1070
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:21,680
essentially that is a rio sheath

1071
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,800
and you can imagine that that's like a

1072
00:37:21,679 --> 00:37:26,078
vast city

1073
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:29,599
uh an entire community of of its own

1074
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:32,160
uh microbes and and you know nutrients

1075
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:34,320
and minerals and water storage capacity

1076
00:37:32,159 --> 00:37:35,358
uh again you know positive and negative

1077
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:37,760
charges

1078
00:37:35,358 --> 00:37:38,799
so to have a rio sheath around your

1079
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:41,040
cannabis plant

1080
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:43,119
is is what you're looking for out of the

1081
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:46,079
gate so right as you start

1082
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:47,358
as you continue to use these containers

1083
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:48,880
or raised beds

1084
00:37:47,358 --> 00:37:50,719
these aggregates will continue to get

1085
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:52,559
bigger and bigger and bigger

1086
00:37:50,719 --> 00:37:54,239
this is why i always say to people do

1087
00:37:52,559 --> 00:37:56,078
not remove your root balls

1088
00:37:54,239 --> 00:37:57,439
just cut your plant off at the at the

1089
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:59,920
surface of the soil

1090
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:01,920
and leave it in there and you you'll see

1091
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:04,240
that how quickly that will break down

1092
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:06,000
and turn back into organic matter so if

1093
00:38:04,239 --> 00:38:07,759
you rip that root ball out

1094
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,920
you've totally disturbed the soil system

1095
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:12,160
you've wrecked all your aggregation

1096
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:14,000
and you've damaged your your biota i

1097
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:16,239
mean you when you remove that out of

1098
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,800
there you've taken the vast majority of

1099
00:38:16,239 --> 00:38:20,159
your rhizosphere which is all uh where

1100
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:22,640
all of your advanced

1101
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:23,598
uh microbes live and do their work

1102
00:38:22,639 --> 00:38:25,358
cycling

1103
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:27,760
so again always leave your root balls in

1104
00:38:25,358 --> 00:38:29,519
the ground and just plant next to them

1105
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:31,359
chances are they will disintegrate

1106
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:35,838
within a few months if

1107
00:38:31,358 --> 00:38:39,279
if not uh by the end of the next cycle

1108
00:38:35,838 --> 00:38:39,599
so how can we form these um back when i

1109
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,839
was

1110
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:43,680
just finishing up my work with elaine

1111
00:38:41,838 --> 00:38:45,679
down at rodale

1112
00:38:43,679 --> 00:38:47,118
uh she introduced me to a gentleman

1113
00:38:45,679 --> 00:38:50,239
named james attillo

1114
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:53,680
james attillo worked on large parks

1115
00:38:50,239 --> 00:38:56,639
and both federal state and town where

1116
00:38:53,679 --> 00:38:58,239
uh they put in this engineered soil so

1117
00:38:56,639 --> 00:38:59,759
that it wouldn't compact so that people

1118
00:38:58,239 --> 00:39:02,479
could walk around the monuments or to

1119
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:05,040
walk down the paths or the parks

1120
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:07,119
and enjoy a nice stroll without either

1121
00:39:05,039 --> 00:39:09,759
getting you know sunk in the mud

1122
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:11,200
or without having you know no plants

1123
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:13,920
being able to live there

1124
00:39:11,199 --> 00:39:14,960
so they did what was called a 90 10 mix

1125
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:18,159
so 90

1126
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:20,000
sand 10 organic matter now the only

1127
00:39:18,159 --> 00:39:21,759
problem was after a few years of

1128
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,400
fertilizing it

1129
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:26,400
so understand that if you use ammonia as

1130
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:28,000
a fertilizer

1131
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,519
the microbes will actually have to

1132
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:33,119
consume carbon

1133
00:39:29,519 --> 00:39:35,759
first to metabolize the ammonia

1134
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:37,358
and allow it to be plant available so

1135
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:40,079
you're burning carbon

1136
00:39:37,358 --> 00:39:43,199
you're burning organic matter and if

1137
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:45,039
you're using nitrogen-based fertilizers

1138
00:39:43,199 --> 00:39:46,639
you are you are doing something similar

1139
00:39:45,039 --> 00:39:49,358
now the microbes need excess

1140
00:39:46,639 --> 00:39:50,799
water to break down that nitrogen and

1141
00:39:49,358 --> 00:39:52,400
make it plant available

1142
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:54,320
so now you're over watering or you have

1143
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:56,559
to use a tremendous amount of water

1144
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:58,559
and either way what's happening to your

1145
00:39:56,559 --> 00:40:00,880
soil system is you're washing your

1146
00:39:58,559 --> 00:40:02,000
fines down so you're losing organic that

1147
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:03,280
matter that way

1148
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,519
or you're getting or they're getting

1149
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:07,599
chewed up by the microbes and so after a

1150
00:40:05,519 --> 00:40:10,079
number of years you basically now have

1151
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:10,720
a few patches of grass a lot of bare

1152
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:13,359
soil

1153
00:40:10,719 --> 00:40:15,679
and a bunch of weeds and that's not

1154
00:40:13,358 --> 00:40:17,838
aesthetically pleasing on these you know

1155
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:19,279
multi-million dollar parks and tourist

1156
00:40:17,838 --> 00:40:21,119
attractions

1157
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:22,319
so his job was to try to figure out how

1158
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:25,838
to get that back

1159
00:40:22,318 --> 00:40:29,440
biology back into play saprophytic fungi

1160
00:40:25,838 --> 00:40:31,440
nematodes um protozoa

1161
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:34,000
and his problem was every time he used a

1162
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:34,400
got brewer and every time he applied his

1163
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,079
tea

1164
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,680
it just washed down the profile so

1165
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:39,519
they'd come back two weeks later

1166
00:40:37,679 --> 00:40:41,358
do a soil test and see that there was

1167
00:40:39,519 --> 00:40:42,159
none of the organisms that he had put in

1168
00:40:41,358 --> 00:40:45,358
play

1169
00:40:42,159 --> 00:40:47,920
uh two weeks prior and so that's when

1170
00:40:45,358 --> 00:40:49,039
um he and i started talking about what i

1171
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:51,039
was doing

1172
00:40:49,039 --> 00:40:52,639
which was actually taking compost and

1173
00:40:51,039 --> 00:40:53,279
putting in a washing machine believe it

1174
00:40:52,639 --> 00:40:56,159
or not

1175
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:58,079
and stripping the biology one of the

1176
00:40:56,159 --> 00:41:01,199
products that came out of that was a

1177
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:01,920
highly concentrated biological hemic

1178
00:41:01,199 --> 00:41:05,118
acid

1179
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:07,760
and it was supercharged magnetically so

1180
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:09,039
what we did is we applied this this

1181
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:11,359
humic acid

1182
00:41:09,039 --> 00:41:12,318
um pretty heavily so it was like diluted

1183
00:41:11,358 --> 00:41:15,598
maybe

1184
00:41:12,318 --> 00:41:16,318
five parts to one five parts water one

1185
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:20,318
part

1186
00:41:16,318 --> 00:41:22,079
um biological humic acid and right away

1187
00:41:20,318 --> 00:41:23,759
uh everything started to bond together

1188
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:25,440
everything all the particulate

1189
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:27,200
sand specifically was was starting to

1190
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:28,880
bond together there was a little bit of

1191
00:41:27,199 --> 00:41:31,679
clay that comes through the process when

1192
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:32,960
i when i do the um the actual washing

1193
00:41:31,679 --> 00:41:35,199
so that we were adding a little bit of

1194
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:36,480
clay and we were adding a tremendous

1195
00:41:35,199 --> 00:41:39,118
amount of bacteria

1196
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:40,639
to start building those those micro

1197
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:43,680
aggregates through their

1198
00:41:40,639 --> 00:41:45,519
uh their glues and it worked and

1199
00:41:43,679 --> 00:41:46,879
two weeks later he came back and the top

1200
00:41:45,519 --> 00:41:49,519
layer of that sand was now

1201
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:50,160
brown it had it had started to bond

1202
00:41:49,519 --> 00:41:53,599
together

1203
00:41:50,159 --> 00:41:56,159
so now he could apply his got brew

1204
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:56,880
and the organisms would stay intact and

1205
00:41:56,159 --> 00:41:58,480
in play

1206
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:00,079
and he'd come back two weeks later he'd

1207
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:02,719
do his biological test

1208
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:03,920
and sure sure shit all of the players

1209
00:42:02,719 --> 00:42:07,039
that he had installed were

1210
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:09,920
present and it took about six months

1211
00:42:07,039 --> 00:42:12,079
uh maybe eight months and now that soil

1212
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,880
profile was down about four to six

1213
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:15,039
inches

1214
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:17,200
um the grasses were all coming back they

1215
00:42:15,039 --> 00:42:19,759
were they were not using the nitrogen

1216
00:42:17,199 --> 00:42:21,679
sources or the ammonia sources anymore

1217
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:23,119
which prevented the killing of these

1218
00:42:21,679 --> 00:42:25,279
biology and and

1219
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:26,559
lo and behold the park was holding up um

1220
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:29,200
they could have their movies

1221
00:42:26,559 --> 00:42:30,078
and and you know have crowds of 10 000

1222
00:42:29,199 --> 00:42:32,078
people

1223
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:34,480
um marching across it without any

1224
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:36,480
problem so that is how you form those

1225
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:37,280
aggregates out of the gate but in in the

1226
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:40,079
situation

1227
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:41,760
as we just talked about it's better to

1228
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:43,599
actually use soil horizons now

1229
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:45,599
they could not rip up all the soil these

1230
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:47,359
parks we had no choice but to try to

1231
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:49,280
figure out how to make it work

1232
00:42:47,358 --> 00:42:50,960
so if you are in a situation where you

1233
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:52,560
have uh heavy sand and

1234
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:54,240
you're trying to grow cannabis this

1235
00:42:52,559 --> 00:42:56,639
would be a good trick for you to

1236
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:57,838
to get that aggregation process to begin

1237
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:59,598
very quickly

1238
00:42:57,838 --> 00:43:01,279
again it's not an end-all be-all because

1239
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:03,519
you're trying to grow this plant

1240
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:05,200
at the first go-around so in that

1241
00:43:03,519 --> 00:43:07,119
situation

1242
00:43:05,199 --> 00:43:09,279
you'd probably have to do both a humic

1243
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:11,920
acid insulation

1244
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:13,359
biologically active humic acid now uh

1245
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:15,119
you'd have to do that first and then a

1246
00:43:13,358 --> 00:43:15,838
cover crop to really you know start to

1247
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:17,599
push

1248
00:43:15,838 --> 00:43:19,599
uh roots down and and get those

1249
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:21,119
aggregates formed so that when you did

1250
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:23,440
do your first run you didn't have any

1251
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:23,440
issues

1252
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:30,240
all right cec cation exchange capacity

1253
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:31,759
this is another unit of measurement used

1254
00:43:30,239 --> 00:43:34,959
in soil testing

1255
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:37,200
and we talked about it briefly uh

1256
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:38,000
in the clay particulate clay particle

1257
00:43:37,199 --> 00:43:41,039
part of this

1258
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:43,920
conversation and i want you to look down

1259
00:43:41,039 --> 00:43:45,440
uh cations on the left hand side of the

1260
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:48,159
picture at the bottom

1261
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:49,119
look calcium magnesium potassium all

1262
00:43:48,159 --> 00:43:51,279
right so

1263
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:53,599
those are those pieces that are so

1264
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:56,240
important in soil fertility

1265
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:57,760
and if there's balanced correctly the

1266
00:43:56,239 --> 00:43:58,639
only other piece you really have to be

1267
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:01,280
concerned about

1268
00:43:58,639 --> 00:44:03,598
is your micronutrients on the right side

1269
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:05,040
we see anions

1270
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:07,039
sulfur which is very important

1271
00:44:05,039 --> 00:44:09,920
phosphorus very important

1272
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:11,279
nitrite and nitrate are very important

1273
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:13,119
now we do have some

1274
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:15,359
issues with fluoride and chloride and

1275
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:17,519
that's why it's really important that

1276
00:44:15,358 --> 00:44:18,400
you're making sure that those anion

1277
00:44:17,519 --> 00:44:20,000
sites are

1278
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:22,000
the things you want and not the things

1279
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:25,039
you don't want same case with

1280
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,000
cations on the left sodium is a big

1281
00:44:25,039 --> 00:44:28,318
problem

1282
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,760
but if you notice sodium is only single

1283
00:44:28,318 --> 00:44:32,719
charged so

1284
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:34,240
you have other other minerals and

1285
00:44:32,719 --> 00:44:35,598
nutrients down the bottom calcium

1286
00:44:34,239 --> 00:44:38,318
magnesium who are double

1287
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:39,920
positive so they will actually push salt

1288
00:44:38,318 --> 00:44:42,880
off of that

1289
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:43,519
clay platelet if you flush it and then

1290
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,440
you add

1291
00:44:43,519 --> 00:44:46,639
the appropriate levels of calcium and

1292
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:48,559
magnesium

1293
00:44:46,639 --> 00:44:50,078
but again you got to be careful not to

1294
00:44:48,559 --> 00:44:52,318
get things out of whack

1295
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:53,440
so flush it try to get rid of much salt

1296
00:44:52,318 --> 00:44:56,079
as possible

1297
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:58,000
and then try to put down the best

1298
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:59,039
balance based on your saturated paste

1299
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,280
test you can

1300
00:44:59,039 --> 00:45:03,119
in hopes that those will repopulate in

1301
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:07,680
the correct amounts

1302
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:09,519
so interesting uh understanding is that

1303
00:45:07,679 --> 00:45:11,679
higher ph will actually have a higher

1304
00:45:09,519 --> 00:45:13,358
cec which is something that's always

1305
00:45:11,679 --> 00:45:15,519
fascinated me because

1306
00:45:13,358 --> 00:45:17,199
in redox potential which we will touch

1307
00:45:15,519 --> 00:45:21,199
on in in january

1308
00:45:17,199 --> 00:45:24,639
um you're looking for low ph low eh

1309
00:45:21,199 --> 00:45:27,919
and high ec and so to think that

1310
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:29,039
fertility is regulated in some degree by

1311
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:31,760
a higher ph is

1312
00:45:29,039 --> 00:45:32,960
is always complicated or that confused

1313
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:34,720
me but

1314
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:36,880
i just wanted to make you aware of that

1315
00:45:34,719 --> 00:45:38,639
that chances are in a higher ph you know

1316
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:40,640
if you're pushing sevens

1317
00:45:38,639 --> 00:45:43,440
you actually gonna have a higher cec

1318
00:45:40,639 --> 00:45:45,838
higher higher rate of fertility

1319
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:47,358
and then obviously the higher cec the

1320
00:45:45,838 --> 00:45:48,719
less fertilizers you need the less

1321
00:45:47,358 --> 00:45:51,598
amendments you need

1322
00:45:48,719 --> 00:45:52,000
and that that also goes true with how

1323
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:54,318
much

1324
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,000
can be stored so remember we have a

1325
00:45:54,318 --> 00:45:57,679
hundred parking spots but if we have

1326
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,559
hundreds of thousands

1327
00:45:57,679 --> 00:46:01,358
of those sites to park on well of course

1328
00:46:00,559 --> 00:46:04,078
we're going to have

1329
00:46:01,358 --> 00:46:06,078
a lot more fertility in the soil so the

1330
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:07,280
measurement of cec is important to take

1331
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:08,400
into consideration when you're doing

1332
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:10,240
your soil test

1333
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:11,838
along with soil organic matter what is

1334
00:46:10,239 --> 00:46:13,759
that percentage

1335
00:46:11,838 --> 00:46:16,000
and then of course your saturated paste

1336
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:18,480
test and then your micronutrients

1337
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,599
if you can get a handle on those four t

1338
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:22,079
key tests

1339
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:23,760
um you're going to be way better off um

1340
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:26,480
out of the gate and and also

1341
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:27,359
in amending so your next go round now we

1342
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:28,800
know for sure

1343
00:46:27,358 --> 00:46:31,039
different cultivars pull different

1344
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:33,200
nutrients so if you're using the same

1345
00:46:31,039 --> 00:46:35,440
cultivar over and over and over again

1346
00:46:33,199 --> 00:46:36,480
then you're definitely depleting one of

1347
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:38,079
the nutrient pools

1348
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:39,920
and so this is why it's so important

1349
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:41,760
that you do soil testing

1350
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:43,599
chip's going to bang that home with you

1351
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:45,359
guys later today that the

1352
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:47,760
without knowing what's going on in your

1353
00:46:45,358 --> 00:46:49,279
soil how can you properly amend

1354
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:51,599
you're either over amending or you're

1355
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:52,480
under amending and both of those cause

1356
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:54,880
issues

1357
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:57,920
so again you know i know a lot of you

1358
00:46:54,880 --> 00:47:00,000
guys complain about the cost of this but

1359
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:01,760
what's the cost of having a failed crop

1360
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,519
or or a reduced

1361
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:05,440
yield in your crop i think it's far

1362
00:47:03,519 --> 00:47:06,159
greater than the cost of a couple tests

1363
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:08,400
during the

1364
00:47:06,159 --> 00:47:09,759
during you know either right before and

1365
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:12,400
then right after so you know how to

1366
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:14,640
amend it for the next one

1367
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:16,559
again cations are positively charged

1368
00:47:14,639 --> 00:47:17,598
anions are negatively charged

1369
00:47:16,559 --> 00:47:20,239
and that's something that you want to

1370
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:22,160
keep in mind um when you're

1371
00:47:20,239 --> 00:47:23,358
when you're again amending your your

1372
00:47:22,159 --> 00:47:25,598
clays so that you

1373
00:47:23,358 --> 00:47:28,239
or or better yet organic matter which

1374
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:30,480
has both negative and positive charges

1375
00:47:28,239 --> 00:47:32,159
again those rhizo sheaths those micro

1376
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:33,199
macro aggregates have both negative and

1377
00:47:32,159 --> 00:47:35,039
positive charges

1378
00:47:33,199 --> 00:47:39,838
so therefore they're holding both groups

1379
00:47:35,039 --> 00:47:39,838
of nutrients that you're looking for

1380
00:47:41,199 --> 00:47:45,039
compost i could do a whole week on this

1381
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:48,079
one well i'll try to keep it

1382
00:47:45,039 --> 00:47:49,759
brief thermophilic so basically

1383
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:51,200
thermophilic compost means you're

1384
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:54,400
heating up compost

1385
00:47:51,199 --> 00:47:56,719
and pretty much what you're left with

1386
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:59,519
is just thermophytes they are the

1387
00:47:56,719 --> 00:48:01,679
bacteria that consume or decompose at an

1388
00:47:59,519 --> 00:48:04,719
incredibly fast rate

1389
00:48:01,679 --> 00:48:07,440
that decomposition creates heat

1390
00:48:04,719 --> 00:48:09,838
and that's why it's called thermophilic

1391
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:12,800
the problem with thermophilic compost is

1392
00:48:09,838 --> 00:48:15,119
as soon as you get over 120 degrees

1393
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:17,119
you're losing mass amounts of organisms

1394
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:20,640
you're losing all of your diversity

1395
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:23,519
you're losing your fungi your protozoa

1396
00:48:20,639 --> 00:48:25,920
and so therefore if you're if you're

1397
00:48:23,519 --> 00:48:26,559
heating it up to the regs the state regs

1398
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:28,400
which

1399
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:29,680
pretty much every state has them

1400
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:30,800
generally they're telling you that you

1401
00:48:29,679 --> 00:48:34,239
need to be

1402
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:37,200
hit between 150 and 160 degrees

1403
00:48:34,239 --> 00:48:39,199
10 times over 15 days or each state has

1404
00:48:37,199 --> 00:48:40,000
a different program but bottom line is

1405
00:48:39,199 --> 00:48:41,679
they're

1406
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,760
kind of forcing you to kill everything

1407
00:48:41,679 --> 00:48:45,519
in that pile repeatedly

1408
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:48,000
and so what you're left with is

1409
00:48:45,519 --> 00:48:49,759
basically chemistry compost

1410
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,199
yeah it still has value it still has

1411
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:54,079
nutrients because that

1412
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:54,399
organic matter is made up of nutrient

1413
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:57,839
but

1414
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:59,440
it's not plant available and you need

1415
00:48:57,838 --> 00:49:01,279
tremendous amount of biology to start

1416
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:04,400
breaking that down and making it

1417
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:07,040
viable for the plant so thermophilic

1418
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:08,880
compost has its issues and the same with

1419
00:49:07,039 --> 00:49:09,838
green waste and the same with food waste

1420
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:12,000
now greenway's

1421
00:49:09,838 --> 00:49:13,838
particular issue is that you you tend to

1422
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:17,280
get a lot of pesticides

1423
00:49:13,838 --> 00:49:17,759
uh you know traditional landscaping

1424
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:19,519
which

1425
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:21,280
frustrates the daylights out of me is

1426
00:49:19,519 --> 00:49:23,679
probably one of the biggest polluters

1427
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:24,480
on this planet uh between the nitrogen

1428
00:49:23,679 --> 00:49:26,318
they're using

1429
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:28,159
the the gas powered equipment that

1430
00:49:26,318 --> 00:49:30,800
they're using of course the

1431
00:49:28,159 --> 00:49:32,239
you know roundup they're using and or

1432
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:35,519
potentially

1433
00:49:32,239 --> 00:49:37,679
other insecticides or uh herbicides

1434
00:49:35,519 --> 00:49:39,599
you know it's just a it's a nightmare

1435
00:49:37,679 --> 00:49:41,838
and and when you take this stuff

1436
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:43,280
and you compost it you're not getting

1437
00:49:41,838 --> 00:49:44,960
rid of anything

1438
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:46,319
you're in many ways kind of

1439
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:48,159
concentrating it

1440
00:49:46,318 --> 00:49:49,679
now i know they tell us that hey you

1441
00:49:48,159 --> 00:49:51,759
know the half-life of this stuff is a

1442
00:49:49,679 --> 00:49:54,318
lot less than it used to be

1443
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:56,160
but again it's like it's like making um

1444
00:49:54,318 --> 00:49:58,000
it's like making a concentrate

1445
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:59,759
you're all you're doing is concentrating

1446
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:02,400
everything more

1447
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:03,760
so i do still use a little bit of

1448
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:06,000
greenways compost

1449
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:07,599
or thermophilic um when i'm making

1450
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:10,239
compost because i want

1451
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:11,599
i want those extra nutrients but i limit

1452
00:50:10,239 --> 00:50:14,558
the amount that i use

1453
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:16,079
so again you know small or less is more

1454
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:17,839
type philosophy

1455
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:19,200
i still want the diversity but i just

1456
00:50:17,838 --> 00:50:21,199
don't want all of the

1457
00:50:19,199 --> 00:50:23,598
problematic problems that come along

1458
00:50:21,199 --> 00:50:25,679
with these types of systems

1459
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:27,519
food waste is really scary i mean you

1460
00:50:25,679 --> 00:50:29,279
have to really cook the hell out of this

1461
00:50:27,519 --> 00:50:33,519
stuff to get rid of all of the

1462
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:35,280
pathogens um i i've had the pleasure and

1463
00:50:33,519 --> 00:50:37,358
and i'm sorry to say i've actually

1464
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:40,720
worked with merck pharmaceutical

1465
00:50:37,358 --> 00:50:41,920
the bad guys the evil empire and they

1466
00:50:40,719 --> 00:50:44,000
had a campus

1467
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:46,480
back in new jersey where they wanted to

1468
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,838
be more sustainable and they were taking

1469
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:50,240
their food waste

1470
00:50:47,838 --> 00:50:52,799
and putting it in this uh rocket

1471
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:54,558
composter the rocket is the brand name

1472
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:56,480
and they were having all kinds of

1473
00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:58,480
problems with it and so

1474
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:00,400
um a gentleman and i a gentleman that i

1475
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:02,639
know well had invited me down to really

1476
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:04,800
kind of figure out what the problem was

1477
00:51:02,639 --> 00:51:06,239
and it was their feedstocks their ratios

1478
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:08,720
were way out

1479
00:51:06,239 --> 00:51:10,558
they did not have enough browns uh

1480
00:51:08,719 --> 00:51:12,558
compared to the amount of vegetables now

1481
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:14,480
they didn't use meat in this one

1482
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:16,240
um they just used vegetables and fruits

1483
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,800
but the balances were way out they were

1484
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:18,479
dumping

1485
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:20,000
because they were trying to process too

1486
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:23,760
much too quickly

1487
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:27,119
it was like 60 70 food waste and only

1488
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:29,839
uh 30 uh 20 um

1489
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:31,039
browns or or carbon sources to to start

1490
00:51:29,838 --> 00:51:33,358
the process

1491
00:51:31,039 --> 00:51:34,880
so yeah they heated this up thing up and

1492
00:51:33,358 --> 00:51:36,000
three days later it spat out this

1493
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:40,318
compost that was

1494
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:42,318
stinky nasty it was just it was a mess

1495
00:51:40,318 --> 00:51:44,239
so i had to slow them down and let them

1496
00:51:42,318 --> 00:51:44,558
understand well look you can't you can't

1497
00:51:44,239 --> 00:51:46,239
dump

1498
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:49,040
all this stuff at once either you need

1499
00:51:46,239 --> 00:51:50,799
another rocket or you need to

1500
00:51:49,039 --> 00:51:52,400
slow down the process which is going to

1501
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:53,599
mean you got to store this stuff in a

1502
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:55,358
refrigerator

1503
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:56,800
um and then and then try to catch up

1504
00:51:55,358 --> 00:51:57,679
over the weekends which they didn't want

1505
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:59,599
to do

1506
00:51:57,679 --> 00:52:01,279
they wanted to just just dump it in

1507
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:02,800
there on monday through friday when

1508
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:05,040
everybody was there so they did make

1509
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:07,039
some changes and it did work out

1510
00:52:05,039 --> 00:52:08,159
but again this compost that came out of

1511
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:11,279
that food waste was

1512
00:52:08,159 --> 00:52:12,799
was just horrible nasty stuff so we got

1513
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:14,400
them to start blending that

1514
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:16,160
with with the green waste that they

1515
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:17,920
produced on on-site

1516
00:52:16,159 --> 00:52:19,440
um again they were they were trying to

1517
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:21,599
have nothing come

1518
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:23,119
on or off the property other than people

1519
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:25,200
and food

1520
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:26,400
and so we were able to blend their green

1521
00:52:25,199 --> 00:52:29,118
waste

1522
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:30,240
with their food waste and let it compost

1523
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:32,480
out for

1524
00:52:30,239 --> 00:52:34,959
about 60 days and it was much better

1525
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:37,199
again it was not biologically active

1526
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:38,880
but it wasn't stinky and it was mature

1527
00:52:37,199 --> 00:52:39,598
enough that it didn't kill plants

1528
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:41,440
because

1529
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:43,119
uh the first stuff that they used uh

1530
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:44,639
from the food waste when they applied it

1531
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:47,358
to the plants

1532
00:52:44,639 --> 00:52:48,318
the plants died and so you know that

1533
00:52:47,358 --> 00:52:50,719
that's not a

1534
00:52:48,318 --> 00:52:51,440
really good way to use that stuff up so

1535
00:52:50,719 --> 00:52:54,000
again those

1536
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:56,000
top three they're they're usable but

1537
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,400
again limit the amounts of that that you

1538
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,079
use

1539
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:59,680
understanding the problems that come

1540
00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:01,920
with it um

1541
00:52:59,679 --> 00:53:04,399
how to make biological compost that has

1542
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:06,800
been the million dollar question

1543
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:08,000
um i've i've showed people how to do

1544
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:09,760
this and i

1545
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,760
i still they still have problems they

1546
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:13,680
still struggle so i'm going to try to

1547
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:17,119
explain it in an easier

1548
00:53:13,679 --> 00:53:19,039
way for you to understand basically what

1549
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:19,680
you're doing is you're collecting greens

1550
00:53:19,039 --> 00:53:21,920
and browns

1551
00:53:19,679 --> 00:53:24,480
your browns are 66 percent your greens

1552
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:26,880
are 33

1553
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:28,800
now you thoroughly mix them together in

1554
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:30,480
a manner that they are homogeneous

1555
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:32,079
and now you got to touch it off with

1556
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:35,280
something now you need

1557
00:53:32,079 --> 00:53:37,039
a inoculant of some kind to get it going

1558
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:38,400
i've tried some ferments that have

1559
00:53:37,039 --> 00:53:41,838
worked wonderful so

1560
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:43,200
i this during corona i was locked down

1561
00:53:41,838 --> 00:53:44,960
out here in oxnard

1562
00:53:43,199 --> 00:53:47,358
so i went down i got some kelp off the

1563
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:49,199
beach i filled a five gallon comp

1564
00:53:47,358 --> 00:53:51,519
pound bucket up about three quarters of

1565
00:53:49,199 --> 00:53:52,960
the way full added water put it out in

1566
00:53:51,519 --> 00:53:55,280
the sun and let it ferment

1567
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:56,480
for five days and by the end of the

1568
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:59,359
fifth day i had this

1569
00:53:56,480 --> 00:54:00,559
you know big white foam on top of it it

1570
00:53:59,358 --> 00:54:03,119
didn't smell

1571
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:04,640
nasty but it definitely smelled funky

1572
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:07,200
kind of musty

1573
00:54:04,639 --> 00:54:09,039
put it under the microscope i was i was

1574
00:54:07,199 --> 00:54:10,399
style and i had tons and tons of

1575
00:54:09,039 --> 00:54:12,318
bacteria

1576
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:14,240
also had some blue-green algae which in

1577
00:54:12,318 --> 00:54:15,039
concentration are bad but in not

1578
00:54:14,239 --> 00:54:17,039
concentrated

1579
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:18,079
they're okay um a tremendous amount of

1580
00:54:17,039 --> 00:54:20,159
green algae

1581
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:21,440
and both the the blue-green algae and

1582
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:22,960
the green algae if you look at them

1583
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:24,559
under a microscope they look very

1584
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:26,240
similar to flagellates

1585
00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:28,480
and also had a bunch of different

1586
00:54:26,239 --> 00:54:29,279
diverse types of flagellates in there as

1587
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:30,960
well

1588
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:32,720
so i've used that to pour it on my

1589
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:34,240
compost

1590
00:54:32,719 --> 00:54:36,239
again you have to use a compost

1591
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:39,039
thermometer if you if you get up to

1592
00:54:36,239 --> 00:54:39,519
115 you should be turning it if you if

1593
00:54:39,039 --> 00:54:42,480
you hit

1594
00:54:39,519 --> 00:54:44,318
120 you're losing things so don't wait

1595
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:44,960
till you hit 120 and then flip it when

1596
00:54:44,318 --> 00:54:48,400
you get up to

1597
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:50,880
115 flip it and by that i mean open up

1598
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:51,519
open up your pile uh mix it thoroughly

1599
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:53,920
together

1600
00:54:51,519 --> 00:54:55,280
and then pile it back up again i've been

1601
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:57,200
a big fan of

1602
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:59,839
a trick that dr lane taught me down at

1603
00:54:57,199 --> 00:55:02,239
roedale which is to take a wire cage

1604
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:04,239
uh wire stock about three feet high you

1605
00:55:02,239 --> 00:55:07,439
know fencing material

1606
00:55:04,239 --> 00:55:10,159
and make a two foot diameter uh

1607
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:11,200
or two foot radius no no diameter uh

1608
00:55:10,159 --> 00:55:13,838
across

1609
00:55:11,199 --> 00:55:14,558
and then use your use that to hold your

1610
00:55:13,838 --> 00:55:17,199
materials

1611
00:55:14,559 --> 00:55:20,160
upright um i consider it as kind of like

1612
00:55:17,199 --> 00:55:22,719
a bioreactor so what happens is in

1613
00:55:20,159 --> 00:55:23,838
down about a third down is we'll have a

1614
00:55:22,719 --> 00:55:27,039
sphere

1615
00:55:23,838 --> 00:55:28,960
of heat that is that is growing out

1616
00:55:27,039 --> 00:55:30,960
um those organisms and the way you can

1617
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:31,838
find that sphere is using a compost

1618
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:33,280
thermometer

1619
00:55:31,838 --> 00:55:35,039
you stab it down on the bottom you'll

1620
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:37,920
see it's it's still cool you

1621
00:55:35,039 --> 00:55:39,920
stab the top it's it's it's cool but as

1622
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:41,680
you slide that thermometer down into the

1623
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:43,440
depth you'll find that sweet spot where

1624
00:55:41,679 --> 00:55:44,480
the center of that bioreaction is

1625
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:46,838
happening

1626
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:49,760
and what i usually do is i waited two

1627
00:55:46,838 --> 00:55:52,078
weeks temperature went up to 115

1628
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:54,079
i flipped it put it back together

1629
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:56,000
temperature went back up to about 110

1630
00:55:54,079 --> 00:55:58,480
and then it started to drop down

1631
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:00,480
to about 80 after two weeks or excuse me

1632
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:02,639
after three and a half four weeks

1633
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:04,480
at that point what i did was i opened it

1634
00:56:02,639 --> 00:56:06,078
back up i microscoped it i had a

1635
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:08,318
wonderful population

1636
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:10,160
of organisms so i took a five gallon

1637
00:56:08,318 --> 00:56:11,119
compound bucket out of there and i added

1638
00:56:10,159 --> 00:56:12,879
a five gallon

1639
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:15,039
five gallon compound bucket of greens

1640
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:17,440
back in at this point you don't need to

1641
00:56:15,039 --> 00:56:18,798
add browns unless you're trying to add

1642
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:22,480
in inoculant

1643
00:56:18,798 --> 00:56:25,920
so like an inoculate like a forest duff

1644
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:27,920
i do want to caution you that if you are

1645
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:30,720
going to go out and collect

1646
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:31,119
forest stuff or forest inoculant that

1647
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:33,358
you

1648
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:34,318
that you wildcraft responsibly and

1649
00:56:33,358 --> 00:56:36,318
spiritually

1650
00:56:34,318 --> 00:56:37,440
when you go out there you want to say a

1651
00:56:36,318 --> 00:56:38,960
prayer you want to get

1652
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:41,119
set your intentions you want to become

1653
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:44,480
part of that soil part of that whole

1654
00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:45,039
ecosystem and use your intuition to

1655
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:46,480
guide you

1656
00:56:45,039 --> 00:56:48,558
the last thing you want to do is collect

1657
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:50,318
a bunch of pathogens and throw that in

1658
00:56:48,559 --> 00:56:51,599
your compost pile and then introduce

1659
00:56:50,318 --> 00:56:52,880
that to your plants

1660
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:55,519
so you really have to have good

1661
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:57,039
intentions uh yet karma's a bitch if you

1662
00:56:55,519 --> 00:56:58,079
if you go out there with with bad

1663
00:56:57,039 --> 00:57:00,719
attitude and and

1664
00:56:58,079 --> 00:57:01,920
you know about stripping and raping you

1665
00:57:00,719 --> 00:57:03,759
she's going to bite you

1666
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:04,960
so if you're going to go out there and

1667
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:06,720
harvest inoculant

1668
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:08,400
whatever you're going to take you bring

1669
00:57:06,719 --> 00:57:10,078
with you an equal amount

1670
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:12,000
so in this situation when i'm going to

1671
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:14,559
go collect inoculant i always bring

1672
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,440
a five gallon compound bucket of good

1673
00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:17,839
compost

1674
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:19,039
so that when i pull that duff back i can

1675
00:57:17,838 --> 00:57:21,119
spread that compost

1676
00:57:19,039 --> 00:57:22,798
layer in kind of like a band-aid and

1677
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:24,318
neosporin and a band-aid

1678
00:57:22,798 --> 00:57:26,318
the last thing in the world you wanna do

1679
00:57:24,318 --> 00:57:27,199
is leave that soil exposed because what

1680
00:57:26,318 --> 00:57:29,759
you've done

1681
00:57:27,199 --> 00:57:31,598
is you've created potential erosion and

1682
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:33,119
you've exposed all those organisms that

1683
00:57:31,599 --> 00:57:36,400
are right around the outside edges

1684
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:37,760
of that to air and and sunlight

1685
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:39,920
and that's problematic you're going to

1686
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:40,319
kill them so you really want to be you

1687
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:43,599
know

1688
00:57:40,318 --> 00:57:45,519
conscious thoughtful good intentions if

1689
00:57:43,599 --> 00:57:47,440
you're going to do something like that

1690
00:57:45,519 --> 00:57:48,798
so if you were interested in trying to

1691
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:52,240
get a heavier

1692
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:55,519
f to b fungal to bacteria ratio in in a

1693
00:57:52,239 --> 00:57:56,798
bio reactor that's what you would do is

1694
00:57:55,519 --> 00:57:59,119
you would get some more

1695
00:57:56,798 --> 00:58:01,199
forest inoculant that again you knew was

1696
00:57:59,119 --> 00:58:03,200
was good you saw healthy mushrooms not

1697
00:58:01,199 --> 00:58:04,960
parasitic mushrooms

1698
00:58:03,199 --> 00:58:07,118
and you knew you were collecting uh

1699
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:07,679
appropriately and then you can add that

1700
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:09,838
in there

1701
00:58:07,679 --> 00:58:11,279
and let it let it sit for a couple weeks

1702
00:58:09,838 --> 00:58:12,960
again make sure you're monitoring your

1703
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:14,400
temperature if you're getting to 115

1704
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:16,480
flip it again

1705
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:17,680
otherwise you can just use greens and

1706
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:19,760
those greens will again

1707
00:58:17,679 --> 00:58:22,239
start to provide more nitrogen so that

1708
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:23,920
that bioreactor will heat back up

1709
00:58:22,239 --> 00:58:25,679
and two weeks later you come back in you

1710
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:26,880
can pull more material out and add more

1711
00:58:25,679 --> 00:58:29,358
material back in

1712
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:30,798
so it's kind of like sourdough bread it

1713
00:58:29,358 --> 00:58:32,239
never ends you're now that you've

1714
00:58:30,798 --> 00:58:34,960
inoculated that pile

1715
00:58:32,239 --> 00:58:36,959
you can just keep adding those greens in

1716
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:38,720
and pulling pulling material out of

1717
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:41,519
there

1718
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:42,879
i would recommend most people to send

1719
00:58:41,519 --> 00:58:45,119
their compost off

1720
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:46,079
to soil food web whether it's soil food

1721
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:49,119
web new york or

1722
00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:50,400
oregon better yet send it to elaine dr

1723
00:58:49,119 --> 00:58:54,880
elaine has a

1724
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:56,798
uh a lab in in oregon as well i believe

1725
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:59,599
but but get an understanding of what you

1726
00:58:56,798 --> 00:59:01,679
have because the hardest part about

1727
00:58:59,599 --> 00:59:03,760
you know making teas and extracts is

1728
00:59:01,679 --> 00:59:04,318
that if you don't have any biology in

1729
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:06,559
there

1730
00:59:04,318 --> 00:59:07,358
then you're not going to get any biology

1731
00:59:06,559 --> 00:59:08,880
out of it

1732
00:59:07,358 --> 00:59:11,119
and that's always been the biggest issue

1733
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:13,358
with compost teas and extracts is that

1734
00:59:11,119 --> 00:59:15,119
you know people i make the best compost

1735
00:59:13,358 --> 00:59:16,798
i make the best compost i put under my

1736
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:18,720
microscope i'm like

1737
00:59:16,798 --> 00:59:20,400
no you don't make the greatest compost

1738
00:59:18,719 --> 00:59:21,759
you make you make a good chemical

1739
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:24,400
compost but you're not making a

1740
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:26,960
biological compost

1741
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:28,400
and so if i take that chemical compost

1742
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:29,519
and i throw it in a brewer what am i

1743
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:31,599
going to get

1744
00:59:29,519 --> 00:59:32,798
dirty water i'm not going to get

1745
00:59:31,599 --> 00:59:34,640
organisms

1746
00:59:32,798 --> 00:59:36,559
so this is a trick on how to make

1747
00:59:34,639 --> 00:59:38,798
biological compost

1748
00:59:36,559 --> 00:59:40,160
so i call them bioreactors or compost

1749
00:59:38,798 --> 00:59:41,920
bullets because they kind of look like a

1750
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:44,239
big bullet

1751
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:45,200
the best way that i've found which takes

1752
00:59:44,239 --> 00:59:48,399
time is

1753
00:59:45,199 --> 00:59:50,399
is to use hugo culture so basically i'll

1754
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:53,440
get our old rotten log

1755
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:55,760
i'm gonna lay it down north to south uh

1756
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:57,838
a couple of them no problem and then i

1757
00:59:55,760 --> 01:00:00,720
lay branches

1758
00:59:57,838 --> 01:00:02,400
i love tree tips i do use some fallen

1759
01:00:00,719 --> 01:00:03,199
branches that are you know rotten and

1760
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:05,358
showing that

1761
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:06,558
mycelium on them but i like the live

1762
01:00:05,358 --> 01:00:08,480
ones as well

1763
01:00:06,559 --> 01:00:10,640
and those get stacked east-west so

1764
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:12,159
basically i made a tepee

1765
01:00:10,639 --> 01:00:14,318
and the length of it can be as long as

1766
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:15,679
you want the width of it should only be

1767
01:00:14,318 --> 01:00:17,759
about eight feet max

1768
01:00:15,679 --> 01:00:19,679
and the height should only be about four

1769
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:22,000
or four and a half feet max

1770
01:00:19,679 --> 01:00:22,719
and so now i've got this you know stick

1771
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,838
running

1772
01:00:22,719 --> 01:00:25,439
north south and all these little

1773
01:00:23,838 --> 01:00:26,480
branches running east-west so i've got

1774
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:28,240
my teepee

1775
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:29,599
now i throw about three inches of hay

1776
01:00:28,239 --> 01:00:31,598
over the top of that

1777
01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:33,599
so that the the browns and greens that

1778
01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:35,280
i'm going to put on top do not fall down

1779
01:00:33,599 --> 01:00:37,200
in and fill up that void

1780
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:38,798
i'm looking to maintain that void

1781
01:00:37,199 --> 01:00:41,118
underneath there that that tent

1782
01:00:38,798 --> 01:00:42,079
so that you know little animals can

1783
01:00:41,119 --> 01:00:44,640
crawl in there

1784
01:00:42,079 --> 01:00:46,798
uh and and more importantly as i'll

1785
01:00:44,639 --> 01:00:49,118
explain that helps to create convection

1786
01:00:46,798 --> 01:00:49,920
to draw off the heat from the pile you

1787
01:00:49,119 --> 01:00:52,160
know both

1788
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:54,000
the huge culture specifically is what's

1789
01:00:52,159 --> 01:00:56,159
called a static compost pile

1790
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:57,679
you do not turn it and if you

1791
01:00:56,159 --> 01:00:59,679
inappropriately mix your greens and

1792
01:00:57,679 --> 01:01:00,960
browns and that heats up

1793
01:00:59,679 --> 01:01:02,399
you're pretty much screwed now you're

1794
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:04,000
gonna have to pull the whole thing apart

1795
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:06,000
and start over again and it's just

1796
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:07,920
it's it's a nightmare you don't want to

1797
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:09,519
go there so that's where it's really

1798
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:10,000
important that you do not add high

1799
01:01:09,519 --> 01:01:12,400
nitrogen

1800
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:14,239
to this and you do appropriately mix

1801
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:15,920
your greens and browns because it is not

1802
01:01:14,239 --> 01:01:17,118
cost effective to tear it apart and turn

1803
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:19,280
it

1804
01:01:17,119 --> 01:01:20,880
so i got my hay now i'm going to start

1805
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:22,319
mixing my greens and browns i'm going to

1806
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:23,680
start throwing them on top

1807
01:01:22,318 --> 01:01:25,358
yes i'm going to add a little bit of

1808
01:01:23,679 --> 01:01:27,039
thermophilic compost or a little bit of

1809
01:01:25,358 --> 01:01:30,000
green compost as i move

1810
01:01:27,039 --> 01:01:31,759
move on i'm always looking for diversity

1811
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:33,440
so i'm not like going out and just

1812
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:35,200
you know hitting an oak tree you know i

1813
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:36,159
want i want oak leaves i want maple

1814
01:01:35,199 --> 01:01:39,199
leaves

1815
01:01:36,159 --> 01:01:41,598
i want some duff um i want you know

1816
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:42,960
hedges i want grass clippings if if they

1817
01:01:41,599 --> 01:01:46,318
are not

1818
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:48,000
been exposed to synthetics so as diverse

1819
01:01:46,318 --> 01:01:50,798
as i possibly can

1820
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:51,358
i recently did a compost building

1821
01:01:50,798 --> 01:01:55,038
program

1822
01:01:51,358 --> 01:01:58,880
at a farm in malibu a malibu fig farm

1823
01:01:55,039 --> 01:02:00,480
and what we did was i i had these kids

1824
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:01,358
going around picking every different

1825
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:03,280
kind

1826
01:02:01,358 --> 01:02:04,480
of green and brown that they could

1827
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:07,599
possibly collect

1828
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:10,159
and it was a game but the purpose was

1829
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:11,599
again we're looking for diversity so the

1830
01:02:10,159 --> 01:02:14,159
more diversity you have

1831
01:02:11,599 --> 01:02:15,680
the better that compost is going to be

1832
01:02:14,159 --> 01:02:16,480
so now you're piling up the greens and

1833
01:02:15,679 --> 01:02:19,199
browns

1834
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:21,599
if you can collect some filamentations

1835
01:02:19,199 --> 01:02:23,759
um

1836
01:02:21,599 --> 01:02:24,798
algae from a creek nearby that you know

1837
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:27,680
again is not

1838
01:02:24,798 --> 01:02:29,679
a superfund site or or you know heavy

1839
01:02:27,679 --> 01:02:31,759
heavy agricultural runoff

1840
01:02:29,679 --> 01:02:34,078
um and and throw some of that in there

1841
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:35,839
or make make it ferment and put that and

1842
01:02:34,079 --> 01:02:36,798
you know throw the the ferment on top of

1843
01:02:35,838 --> 01:02:38,400
this pile

1844
01:02:36,798 --> 01:02:40,159
so you want to be adding moisture while

1845
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:42,318
you're building it and then as

1846
01:02:40,159 --> 01:02:43,358
you finish and and you're up to your

1847
01:02:42,318 --> 01:02:45,920
eight foot wide

1848
01:02:43,358 --> 01:02:47,679
four and a half feet tall now you want

1849
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:48,400
to throw on a whole bunch of cover crop

1850
01:02:47,679 --> 01:02:50,399
seeds

1851
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:52,079
um i often would pick little shrubs or

1852
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:52,720
little saplings out of that adjacent

1853
01:02:52,079 --> 01:02:55,039
forest

1854
01:02:52,719 --> 01:02:55,838
plant them in there and then straw the

1855
01:02:55,039 --> 01:02:58,240
whole thing in

1856
01:02:55,838 --> 01:02:59,920
and water it heavy now you come back six

1857
01:02:58,239 --> 01:03:01,679
months later you're gonna have miles of

1858
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:03,039
raw sphere you're gonna have incredible

1859
01:03:01,679 --> 01:03:06,159
amounts of

1860
01:03:03,039 --> 01:03:08,640
protozoa nematodes worms everything

1861
01:03:06,159 --> 01:03:10,798
and again the reason we piled this on

1862
01:03:08,639 --> 01:03:12,558
top of those sticks and branches was so

1863
01:03:10,798 --> 01:03:14,719
that we had good convection

1864
01:03:12,559 --> 01:03:17,039
so as that pile heated up on top of

1865
01:03:14,719 --> 01:03:17,679
those sticks the heat would come out the

1866
01:03:17,039 --> 01:03:19,280
top

1867
01:03:17,679 --> 01:03:21,199
and cool air would come in from both

1868
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:24,079
sides or all sides

1869
01:03:21,199 --> 01:03:26,239
and help to mitigate the amount of heat

1870
01:03:24,079 --> 01:03:28,079
that was being stored in that pile

1871
01:03:26,239 --> 01:03:29,919
so now those those are some great

1872
01:03:28,079 --> 01:03:32,480
techniques for making biologically rich

1873
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:32,480
compost

1874
01:03:33,199 --> 01:03:36,639
peat moss everybody that knows me knows

1875
01:03:35,199 --> 01:03:38,719
i'm just

1876
01:03:36,639 --> 01:03:40,558
adamantly against peat moss it's it's

1877
01:03:38,719 --> 01:03:42,000
just it's so detrimental to the

1878
01:03:40,559 --> 01:03:43,760
environment

1879
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:45,599
it they basically took thousands of

1880
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:48,799
years for those peat bogs to

1881
01:03:45,599 --> 01:03:50,400
to form they are an incredible water

1882
01:03:48,798 --> 01:03:52,639
filtration system

1883
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:53,440
um the reason why that peat does not

1884
01:03:52,639 --> 01:03:57,199
disintegrate

1885
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:57,200
is because again the ph suspension

1886
01:03:57,358 --> 01:04:01,279
peat moss is always you know down around

1887
01:03:59,358 --> 01:04:02,719
four or five so you do not get a lot of

1888
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:04,720
biological activity

1889
01:04:02,719 --> 01:04:06,798
there's no way thermophytes or or a lot

1890
01:04:04,719 --> 01:04:09,439
of other decomposers can live there

1891
01:04:06,798 --> 01:04:11,440
and that's how it's built so as built up

1892
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:12,720
over thousands of years

1893
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:15,119
is because there's not anything

1894
01:04:12,719 --> 01:04:17,038
decomposing it

1895
01:04:15,119 --> 01:04:18,720
peat bogs only cover three percent of

1896
01:04:17,039 --> 01:04:20,880
the earth and they

1897
01:04:18,719 --> 01:04:22,879
provide an incredible amount of clean

1898
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:26,079
fresh water to aquifers

1899
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:29,280
groundwater streams rivers lakes creeks

1900
01:04:26,079 --> 01:04:30,798
uh around them so for us to be mining

1901
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:33,920
that material

1902
01:04:30,798 --> 01:04:34,559
releasing the uh the co2 that happens

1903
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:37,119
when we rip

1904
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:37,760
up the mine um it's a triple negative

1905
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:39,440
and now you're

1906
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:41,680
now you're moving this stuff all over

1907
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:42,880
the place and creating a huge carbon

1908
01:04:41,679 --> 01:04:45,118
footprint

1909
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:47,200
so please stop using pete i understand

1910
01:04:45,119 --> 01:04:48,640
that it had its place in the day but we

1911
01:04:47,199 --> 01:04:49,919
have new alternatives which we're going

1912
01:04:48,639 --> 01:04:52,239
to get into

1913
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:54,079
in a minute the other problem with pete

1914
01:04:52,239 --> 01:04:55,679
is is all you well know it it goes

1915
01:04:54,079 --> 01:04:57,760
hydrophobic on the outside

1916
01:04:55,679 --> 01:04:59,598
and it gets anaerobic on the inside so

1917
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:01,599
it's very difficult to

1918
01:04:59,599 --> 01:05:02,880
uh really grow a plant and hit full

1919
01:05:01,599 --> 01:05:05,039
potential when

1920
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:06,318
when there's areas that are anaerobic

1921
01:05:05,039 --> 01:05:07,920
and and of course when you're pouring

1922
01:05:06,318 --> 01:05:08,719
water on top you can't get the water to

1923
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:10,000
go in

1924
01:05:08,719 --> 01:05:12,558
it does not help with your watering

1925
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:14,400
practices and again you know i

1926
01:05:12,559 --> 01:05:15,920
drives me nuts when people say oh well

1927
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:19,280
you know it's it's just

1928
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:21,039
a more sustainable peat bog

1929
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:22,720
no there's nothing sustainable about

1930
01:05:21,039 --> 01:05:24,000
mining peat and it's definitely not

1931
01:05:22,719 --> 01:05:26,078
renewable

1932
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:27,280
so please you know again i'm adamantly

1933
01:05:26,079 --> 01:05:28,400
against this stuff

1934
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:30,960
and i'm going to show you some other

1935
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:33,280
sources that we can work with to replace

1936
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:33,280
pete

1937
01:05:34,559 --> 01:05:40,480
coco core um it has its issues and

1938
01:05:38,318 --> 01:05:42,318
anybody that's used it in the past um

1939
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:44,880
generally most of it was coming or

1940
01:05:42,318 --> 01:05:45,920
99 plus percent was coming from the far

1941
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:47,838
east

1942
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:49,200
and so the coconuts over there are grown

1943
01:05:47,838 --> 01:05:51,358
in brackish water so

1944
01:05:49,199 --> 01:05:52,639
there tend to be a lot of salt buildup

1945
01:05:51,358 --> 01:05:55,199
in the core

1946
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:57,358
and also there was hydrocarbons i mean

1947
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:57,919
they they produced this stuff over there

1948
01:05:57,358 --> 01:06:00,318
in these

1949
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:02,240
giant yards where they're running

1950
01:06:00,318 --> 01:06:02,960
bulldozers and tractors and equipment

1951
01:06:02,239 --> 01:06:04,399
over it

1952
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:07,039
so they're compacting it they're

1953
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:09,680
smashing the fibers together

1954
01:06:07,039 --> 01:06:10,640
they're leaking gas hydraulic fluid oil

1955
01:06:09,679 --> 01:06:13,199
all in it

1956
01:06:10,639 --> 01:06:15,038
and and then they're bagging it and

1957
01:06:13,199 --> 01:06:15,598
pressing it as hard as they can i think

1958
01:06:15,039 --> 01:06:18,400
they always

1959
01:06:15,599 --> 01:06:19,519
over 10 pounds of pressure to compact

1960
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:21,760
this stuff

1961
01:06:19,519 --> 01:06:22,880
and bag it so that they can ship it all

1962
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:24,559
over the world

1963
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:26,798
they're trying to increase their profit

1964
01:06:24,559 --> 01:06:29,200
margin by pressing as much as they

1965
01:06:26,798 --> 01:06:30,798
possibly can into that bag

1966
01:06:29,199 --> 01:06:32,879
problem with that is they destroy the

1967
01:06:30,798 --> 01:06:34,480
fiber the fiber itself has now been

1968
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:36,240
crushed

1969
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:37,920
whereas peat they don't press it like

1970
01:06:36,239 --> 01:06:38,798
that and that's why traditionally pete

1971
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:41,358
has been a

1972
01:06:38,798 --> 01:06:44,000
solid source of both nutrient storage

1973
01:06:41,358 --> 01:06:45,920
capacity and water storage capacity

1974
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:48,639
so in the past core has gotten a really

1975
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:51,200
bad name because of the processes

1976
01:06:48,639 --> 01:06:53,279
in which they manufacture and ship it

1977
01:06:51,199 --> 01:06:56,000
across the world to us

1978
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:57,519
recently i found a wonderful source of

1979
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:59,280
mexican core

1980
01:06:57,519 --> 01:07:01,358
so it's not grown in brackish water

1981
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:03,839
there is no salt

1982
01:07:01,358 --> 01:07:04,400
and he only presses it to about two

1983
01:07:03,838 --> 01:07:05,838
pounds

1984
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:08,000
because he doesn't have to ship it

1985
01:07:05,838 --> 01:07:09,199
across the world but more importantly he

1986
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,960
did studies on it

1987
01:07:09,199 --> 01:07:12,239
he took the time to really look at the

1988
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:14,639
fiber

1989
01:07:12,239 --> 01:07:16,399
understand how it structurally worked

1990
01:07:14,639 --> 01:07:17,440
what he he was inquisitive you want to

1991
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:20,400
know why this

1992
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:20,960
why this product did what it did um and

1993
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:23,519
he's had

1994
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:24,318
amazing results so he he dialed back his

1995
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:27,038
pressing to

1996
01:07:24,318 --> 01:07:28,239
to about two pounds or less uh per

1997
01:07:27,039 --> 01:07:30,640
square foot and and

1998
01:07:28,239 --> 01:07:31,919
so you don't get as much by volume as

1999
01:07:30,639 --> 01:07:35,038
you break it up

2000
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:35,838
but it's functions um and it's it

2001
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:37,920
doesn't

2002
01:07:35,838 --> 01:07:40,159
he hasn't destroyed the integrity of the

2003
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:43,358
product

2004
01:07:40,159 --> 01:07:46,000
and another thing i really love about um

2005
01:07:43,358 --> 01:07:47,358
quarre is that it has a wonderful source

2006
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:50,079
of potassium

2007
01:07:47,358 --> 01:07:52,159
now it's not a potassium that is mobile

2008
01:07:50,079 --> 01:07:54,960
so you don't have to worry about it

2009
01:07:52,159 --> 01:07:56,078
leaching out really quick it's bound up

2010
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:58,960
pretty tight in

2011
01:07:56,079 --> 01:08:00,318
in the fiber itself so the only way it

2012
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:03,599
can be released is with

2013
01:08:00,318 --> 01:08:06,639
bacterial uh decomposition

2014
01:08:03,599 --> 01:08:08,240
so again the plant wants more potassium

2015
01:08:06,639 --> 01:08:10,798
it sends more exidates out for the

2016
01:08:08,239 --> 01:08:12,719
potassium mining bacteria

2017
01:08:10,798 --> 01:08:14,480
that bacteria grows out minds more

2018
01:08:12,719 --> 01:08:16,798
material uh

2019
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:19,279
lets it leak back to the to the plant

2020
01:08:16,798 --> 01:08:21,439
either by being consumed by protozoa

2021
01:08:19,279 --> 01:08:23,600
or by releasing it in the biosphere or

2022
01:08:21,439 --> 01:08:25,439
or when they start to die off

2023
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:26,880
so again it's a wonderful source of

2024
01:08:25,439 --> 01:08:29,198
potassium holds

2025
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:30,880
minerals and nutrients great and it

2026
01:08:29,198 --> 01:08:31,919
breaks down really really slow it

2027
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:33,679
definitely breaks down

2028
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:39,838
longer it takes longer to break down

2029
01:08:33,679 --> 01:08:39,838
than than peat moss does

2030
01:08:40,719 --> 01:08:48,640
pitt moss um

2031
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:51,119
i met mott hadley back uh probably 10

2032
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:53,600
years ago at the phipps conservatory

2033
01:08:51,119 --> 01:08:54,318
the phipps conservatory is in uh

2034
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:57,600
pittsburgh

2035
01:08:54,319 --> 01:09:01,359
pennsylvania and phipps was a buddy and

2036
01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:04,960
uh fellow corporate raider

2037
01:09:01,359 --> 01:09:07,120
uh along with um rockefeller

2038
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:09,198
and you know the steel business in in

2039
01:09:07,119 --> 01:09:10,798
pittsburgh so they made tons of money

2040
01:09:09,198 --> 01:09:11,678
and phipps decided he was going to build

2041
01:09:10,798 --> 01:09:14,238
a

2042
01:09:11,679 --> 01:09:15,679
badass monument to himself and collect

2043
01:09:14,238 --> 01:09:16,559
plants from all over the world and he

2044
01:09:15,679 --> 01:09:20,480
did it and it's

2045
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:23,120
it's quite spectacular now

2046
01:09:20,479 --> 01:09:23,599
the fips was doing uh what i want to

2047
01:09:23,119 --> 01:09:26,719
call

2048
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:28,880
more organic style classes in the back

2049
01:09:26,719 --> 01:09:31,279
you know teaching people about lawn care

2050
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:33,039
and they got some pushback because in in

2051
01:09:31,279 --> 01:09:34,080
the conservatory side they were they

2052
01:09:33,039 --> 01:09:36,880
were mass producing

2053
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:38,399
plants um for their displays every three

2054
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:40,159
months they would go in and rip out all

2055
01:09:38,399 --> 01:09:41,358
the existing plants plant a bunch of new

2056
01:09:40,158 --> 01:09:44,719
ones based on

2057
01:09:41,359 --> 01:09:45,759
a theme spring fall christmas new year's

2058
01:09:44,719 --> 01:09:48,640
whatever

2059
01:09:45,759 --> 01:09:49,838
and so in doing that they had to produce

2060
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:52,480
a ton of plants

2061
01:09:49,838 --> 01:09:52,880
uh very quickly so they could flip out

2062
01:09:52,479 --> 01:09:55,198
the

2063
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:56,480
the displays so of course they were

2064
01:09:55,198 --> 01:09:59,919
using synthetics

2065
01:09:56,479 --> 01:10:02,238
so with that pushback they called moden

2066
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:05,199
to provide a more sustainable

2067
01:10:02,238 --> 01:10:07,279
plant matrix than than peat moss and

2068
01:10:05,198 --> 01:10:09,279
they brought me in to provide them with

2069
01:10:07,279 --> 01:10:12,000
a high level of biology

2070
01:10:09,279 --> 01:10:14,158
in hopes that we could have them reduce

2071
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:16,880
their synthetic footprint

2072
01:10:14,158 --> 01:10:18,719
the experiment ended in in what i want

2073
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:19,520
to call in their mind a failure in mind

2074
01:10:18,719 --> 01:10:20,880
it was a lesson

2075
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:22,960
i don't think there's any such thing as

2076
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:25,279
a failure they're all lessons

2077
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:27,198
and what happened was that the biology

2078
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:27,920
just set up shop on on the pit moss and

2079
01:10:27,198 --> 01:10:31,439
did not have an

2080
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:33,119
association with the plant um so it was

2081
01:10:31,439 --> 01:10:35,678
in my mind a wonderful

2082
01:10:33,119 --> 01:10:37,599
soil amendment but not an ideal

2083
01:10:35,679 --> 01:10:40,239
substrate to grow plants

2084
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:40,719
without fertilizer kind of like peat

2085
01:10:40,238 --> 01:10:42,639
moss

2086
01:10:40,719 --> 01:10:44,079
if you don't add something to the peat

2087
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:46,239
you're you're not going to get

2088
01:10:44,079 --> 01:10:47,600
a wonderful plant because there's no

2089
01:10:46,238 --> 01:10:52,399
nutrition in

2090
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:54,800
pete so the lesson we learned was that

2091
01:10:52,399 --> 01:10:56,879
this first round formula wasn't ideal

2092
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:58,560
for biologicals unless you were using

2093
01:10:56,880 --> 01:11:00,719
this as a soil amendment

2094
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:03,199
and you wanted to give more organic

2095
01:11:00,719 --> 01:11:06,719
matter and homes for biology to

2096
01:11:03,198 --> 01:11:09,919
set up shop grow out colonize and then

2097
01:11:06,719 --> 01:11:13,840
create those aggregates so

2098
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:16,800
recently i was on a podcast uh

2099
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:19,600
or yeah i was on a podcast this spring

2100
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:22,400
and i got lo and hold i got hit up by

2101
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:23,520
a girl named ashley from from pittmoss

2102
01:11:22,399 --> 01:11:24,879
and i was like whoa

2103
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:26,800
you know i always wondered what happened

2104
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:29,039
to mod i he he

2105
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:30,719
shark tanked he made a bunch of money uh

2106
01:11:29,039 --> 01:11:32,238
got a bunch of grants and then he just

2107
01:11:30,719 --> 01:11:33,920
disappeared i mean you know i didn't

2108
01:11:32,238 --> 01:11:35,919
know what happened to him

2109
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:37,119
and she's like yeah well you know things

2110
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:40,719
didn't work out with mott

2111
01:11:37,119 --> 01:11:44,079
so we've uh the investors taken over

2112
01:11:40,719 --> 01:11:44,800
pittmoss and we've hired uh dr charles

2113
01:11:44,079 --> 01:11:48,319
bethke

2114
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:50,880
as our soil chemist and formulation man

2115
01:11:48,319 --> 01:11:51,439
and we've got a new ceo brian and i'm

2116
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:55,440
here

2117
01:11:51,439 --> 01:11:57,119
in charge of marketing and sales

2118
01:11:55,439 --> 01:11:58,639
so i'm like wow great what did you what

2119
01:11:57,119 --> 01:12:00,640
have you done and she said we just spent

2120
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:02,640
three years reformulating

2121
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:04,159
i'm like fantastic send me out what you

2122
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:06,320
got it let me play with it

2123
01:12:04,158 --> 01:12:08,960
um so the first tests i did side by

2124
01:12:06,319 --> 01:12:11,279
sides were water only

2125
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:13,119
one of the products was a little bit

2126
01:12:11,279 --> 01:12:16,158
better than the others

2127
01:12:13,119 --> 01:12:18,000
and the second one was biology when i

2128
01:12:16,158 --> 01:12:19,759
did the biologicals and again i

2129
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:21,359
what i did was i used this material and

2130
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:22,800
i used grass seed something that would

2131
01:12:21,359 --> 01:12:24,079
grow quick that i could see plant

2132
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:27,039
reaction with

2133
01:12:24,079 --> 01:12:28,399
and the growers grade was was close

2134
01:12:27,039 --> 01:12:31,519
second and the cocoa

2135
01:12:28,399 --> 01:12:33,679
complete was by far um

2136
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:34,880
outperformed the the vast majority of

2137
01:12:33,679 --> 01:12:37,520
their products

2138
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:39,359
i don't know exactly why my gut feeling

2139
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:40,560
is the potassium as well as the

2140
01:12:39,359 --> 01:12:42,799
structure of it

2141
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:44,880
the core adds to the growers grade now

2142
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:48,079
the growers grade is just

2143
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:51,520
pretty much um ground up newspapers

2144
01:12:48,079 --> 01:12:54,479
uh and and uh cardboard boxes

2145
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:56,640
um so a a waste stream that definitely

2146
01:12:54,479 --> 01:12:57,678
needs to be utilized way better than it

2147
01:12:56,640 --> 01:13:00,400
is

2148
01:12:57,679 --> 01:13:01,760
now this product is sustainable it is

2149
01:13:00,399 --> 01:13:03,920
regenerative because you're

2150
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:05,920
you're eliminating waste material from

2151
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:08,158
getting into landfills

2152
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:10,239
and it works wonderful so here is a

2153
01:13:08,158 --> 01:13:11,519
perfect example of a material that you

2154
01:13:10,238 --> 01:13:14,879
can use

2155
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:15,600
to stop using peat moss and stop the

2156
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:17,760
mining

2157
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:19,360
and remember as soon as you stop buying

2158
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:20,800
it they're still going to mine it

2159
01:13:19,359 --> 01:13:22,079
they're just going to pile it up to a

2160
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:22,880
point where all of a sudden it's still

2161
01:13:22,079 --> 01:13:24,880
sitting there

2162
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:26,400
and no one's buying it so the sooner you

2163
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:29,760
stop using this

2164
01:13:26,399 --> 01:13:31,119
the sooner they stop mining it again the

2165
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:34,000
nice thing about

2166
01:13:31,119 --> 01:13:36,158
pit moss is that it does break down slow

2167
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:38,079
but it does provide that water storage

2168
01:13:36,158 --> 01:13:40,559
capacity it provides a wonderful source

2169
01:13:38,079 --> 01:13:41,119
of carbon for the microbes to set up

2170
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:44,000
shop and

2171
01:13:41,119 --> 01:13:47,840
and mine and build those glues uh to

2172
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:47,840
form those macro and micro aggregates

2173
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:52,800
soilless mediums and hydroponic soils i

2174
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:54,079
think we've all kind of learned the

2175
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:55,600
lesson of these

2176
01:13:54,079 --> 01:13:57,840
one-third peat one-third aeration

2177
01:13:55,600 --> 01:14:01,039
one-third compost yeah they work great

2178
01:13:57,840 --> 01:14:03,279
do have to add nutrients to them um

2179
01:14:01,039 --> 01:14:04,560
you know you do have to top dress them

2180
01:14:03,279 --> 01:14:07,599
biggest problem with these

2181
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:09,360
systems is they they do go hydrophobic

2182
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:11,120
and they do go anaerobic

2183
01:14:09,359 --> 01:14:14,079
and they i don't think they're ever

2184
01:14:11,119 --> 01:14:16,719
going to form any kind of aggregation

2185
01:14:14,079 --> 01:14:18,079
so and the other piece too is that they

2186
01:14:16,719 --> 01:14:21,119
they lose volume as

2187
01:14:18,079 --> 01:14:23,439
they break down and get in you know the

2188
01:14:21,119 --> 01:14:24,880
processes the biological processes of

2189
01:14:23,439 --> 01:14:27,279
breaking this down

2190
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:28,800
creates a tremendous amount of fines and

2191
01:14:27,279 --> 01:14:30,238
those fines as you water

2192
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:32,480
move through the soil system to the

2193
01:14:30,238 --> 01:14:32,959
bottom of the bag and eventually you end

2194
01:14:32,479 --> 01:14:35,839
up with

2195
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:36,960
a muddy anaerobic layer at the bottom of

2196
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:39,679
that pot

2197
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:43,198
and i think you know we really need to

2198
01:14:39,679 --> 01:14:45,760
rethink that allowing that kind of

2199
01:14:43,198 --> 01:14:47,359
surface area to go anaerobic what

2200
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:48,960
happens when the roots go down there

2201
01:14:47,359 --> 01:14:51,119
and they touch it well first they

2202
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:53,279
excrete their border cells

2203
01:14:51,119 --> 01:14:54,960
as a protection method but now the root

2204
01:14:53,279 --> 01:14:56,559
tip is even more vulnerable

2205
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:58,560
and so if that didn't work at holding

2206
01:14:56,560 --> 01:15:01,039
the anaerobes off now the anaerobes can

2207
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:02,719
have direct access to melt that root tip

2208
01:15:01,039 --> 01:15:04,399
and how are you ever going to hit plant

2209
01:15:02,719 --> 01:15:07,198
potential if your

2210
01:15:04,399 --> 01:15:08,639
roots are not functioning at the top

2211
01:15:07,198 --> 01:15:10,319
that they can

2212
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:12,880
and i think that's the goal here is to

2213
01:15:10,319 --> 01:15:15,359
really try to figure out ways to

2214
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:17,199
um give that plant everything it

2215
01:15:15,359 --> 01:15:21,119
possibly can have

2216
01:15:17,198 --> 01:15:21,839
to express itself in in its fullest way

2217
01:15:21,119 --> 01:15:23,920
i mean don't

2218
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:24,960
all humans want that don't all plants

2219
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:27,760
want that

2220
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:28,319
to to be able to live its fullest life

2221
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:31,360
and

2222
01:15:28,319 --> 01:15:32,880
uh to its greatest potential and so

2223
01:15:31,359 --> 01:15:34,719
i don't think these you know these

2224
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:36,719
soilless medium and hydroponic soil

2225
01:15:34,719 --> 01:15:39,840
systems will ever provide that

2226
01:15:36,719 --> 01:15:39,840
um to a plant

2227
01:15:41,039 --> 01:15:44,238
now we get into super soils and i think

2228
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:47,600
that was a great advance

2229
01:15:44,238 --> 01:15:48,718
over the original you know uh one-third

2230
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:51,280
one-third one-third

2231
01:15:48,719 --> 01:15:53,359
i mean yes that's the base of it but now

2232
01:15:51,279 --> 01:15:56,800
they've added in a bunch of

2233
01:15:53,359 --> 01:15:58,719
organic solid nutrients or minerals

2234
01:15:56,800 --> 01:16:00,320
and letting letting the biology break it

2235
01:15:58,719 --> 01:16:02,880
down so instead of using a

2236
01:16:00,319 --> 01:16:04,319
bottled nutrient which we all know yes

2237
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:06,719
you can get organic ones but

2238
01:16:04,319 --> 01:16:08,000
but again you're contributing to you

2239
01:16:06,719 --> 01:16:10,239
know

2240
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:11,679
a giant carbon footprint you're spending

2241
01:16:10,238 --> 01:16:12,639
a lot of money that you don't need to

2242
01:16:11,679 --> 01:16:14,800
spend

2243
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:16,400
and you can do that without using you

2244
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:18,239
can grow plants without using those

2245
01:16:16,399 --> 01:16:19,599
bottled nutrients and this was a great

2246
01:16:18,238 --> 01:16:21,359
alternative to

2247
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:23,360
to bottled nutrients and that was that

2248
01:16:21,359 --> 01:16:25,519
they provided the right level of

2249
01:16:23,359 --> 01:16:29,279
minerals you know oyster meals crab

2250
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:32,000
shell seaweed extract

2251
01:16:29,279 --> 01:16:33,519
you name it feather meal for nitrogen

2252
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,319
blood meal you know everything that the

2253
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:37,199
plant needed

2254
01:16:34,319 --> 01:16:38,799
for its cycle was put into the soil and

2255
01:16:37,198 --> 01:16:41,198
basically you were

2256
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:42,719
biology or you know compost tea compost

2257
01:16:41,198 --> 01:16:44,479
extract and water only

2258
01:16:42,719 --> 01:16:46,960
and the biology did the work for

2259
01:16:44,479 --> 01:16:48,399
breaking down those raw minerals

2260
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:51,279
that's always been the biggest beef with

2261
01:16:48,399 --> 01:16:52,799
organic nutrient supplies is that

2262
01:16:51,279 --> 01:16:54,719
people throw it on their lawn and say oh

2263
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:56,400
it doesn't work or they add it to their

2264
01:16:54,719 --> 01:16:58,480
pot and it doesn't work well

2265
01:16:56,399 --> 01:16:59,679
if they don't have the biology to break

2266
01:16:58,479 --> 01:17:01,519
that down

2267
01:16:59,679 --> 01:17:02,719
and make it plant available then of

2268
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:04,400
course it's not going to work it's just

2269
01:17:02,719 --> 01:17:07,439
going to sit there

2270
01:17:04,399 --> 01:17:09,119
in suspension so that's why

2271
01:17:07,439 --> 01:17:10,960
i think super soils really took it to

2272
01:17:09,119 --> 01:17:12,640
the next level

2273
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:14,880
and people understood that they needed

2274
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:17,199
still needed to get the biology in play

2275
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:19,119
but everything was was built into the

2276
01:17:17,198 --> 01:17:20,719
soil system so they didn't have to use

2277
01:17:19,119 --> 01:17:21,760
these liquid nutrients which were so

2278
01:17:20,719 --> 01:17:23,760
expensive

2279
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:25,360
um and a questionable at best because

2280
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:26,320
you never really know what goes into the

2281
01:17:25,359 --> 01:17:28,158
bottle

2282
01:17:26,319 --> 01:17:30,158
and that's why i'm a big proponent of

2283
01:17:28,158 --> 01:17:31,119
like dragonfly earth medicine you know

2284
01:17:30,158 --> 01:17:33,920
they're all about

2285
01:17:31,119 --> 01:17:35,119
take what's on your farm you know if you

2286
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:37,679
need a nutrient

2287
01:17:35,119 --> 01:17:38,559
or a mineral take it from your farm find

2288
01:17:37,679 --> 01:17:40,560
it um

2289
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:41,920
and that's great if you if you have farm

2290
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:43,520
if you don't if you're in the

2291
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:45,440
urban environment or suburban

2292
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:46,080
environment yeah now you got to bring

2293
01:17:45,439 --> 01:17:48,238
stuff in

2294
01:17:46,079 --> 01:17:50,079
but you really need to know your source

2295
01:17:48,238 --> 01:17:53,359
of what you're bringing in

2296
01:17:50,079 --> 01:17:54,479
i recently worked with a gentleman in a

2297
01:17:53,359 --> 01:17:57,198
farm in illinois

2298
01:17:54,479 --> 01:17:58,000
he brought in compost that was supposed

2299
01:17:57,198 --> 01:18:00,238
to be the best

2300
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:02,479
on the planet and blah blah and he

2301
01:18:00,238 --> 01:18:03,919
spread it on 60 acres or 30 acres of

2302
01:18:02,479 --> 01:18:06,718
land and killed everything

2303
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:07,920
um it was a very immature compost and

2304
01:18:06,719 --> 01:18:08,640
that was something that i didn't get

2305
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:10,960
into

2306
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:12,159
above and i should have but um well

2307
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:14,000
actually we'll get into it in the scene

2308
01:18:12,158 --> 01:18:14,879
cdn ratios and we'll talk more about it

2309
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,238
then but

2310
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:18,159
i'm not going to spend a ton of time on

2311
01:18:16,238 --> 01:18:19,119
super soils but i think they were a big

2312
01:18:18,158 --> 01:18:24,479
advance

2313
01:18:19,119 --> 01:18:24,479
um in just traditional you know soilless

2314
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:29,600
mediums

2315
01:18:26,399 --> 01:18:32,879
seed end ratio here we go all right so

2316
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:36,800
top right corner bacteria are 5.5

2317
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:40,000
carbon to one nitrogen fungi or 8.3

2318
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:41,840
carbon to fungi to nitrogen so here's

2319
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:43,039
here's those ratios and and this is why

2320
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:45,760
it's really important

2321
01:18:43,039 --> 01:18:46,238
so top right you see organic examples so

2322
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:49,119
we see

2323
01:18:46,238 --> 01:18:51,279
blood fish and soy meal all right and

2324
01:18:49,119 --> 01:18:54,238
now go slide across the chart to the

2325
01:18:51,279 --> 01:18:57,119
left you see the ratio is five to 1.

2326
01:18:54,238 --> 01:18:57,678
now what that means is that the lower c

2327
01:18:57,119 --> 01:19:01,279
to n

2328
01:18:57,679 --> 01:19:02,319
ratios the more mobile they use the word

2329
01:19:01,279 --> 01:19:04,319
mineralization

2330
01:19:02,319 --> 01:19:07,039
well mineralization is essentially

2331
01:19:04,319 --> 01:19:09,840
mobile so if you pour blood meal or fish

2332
01:19:07,039 --> 01:19:11,920
meal or soybean meal on your soil

2333
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:13,279
and then you water it you're moving it

2334
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:14,960
through the soil profile

2335
01:19:13,279 --> 01:19:16,639
and if you over water you've washed it

2336
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:18,000
right out of your soil system

2337
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:20,400
so that's why it's important to

2338
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:21,679
understand these cdn ratios

2339
01:19:20,399 --> 01:19:23,599
because they're going to provide you

2340
01:19:21,679 --> 01:19:26,640
with short-term and long-term

2341
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:28,239
sources of of minerals and nutrients um

2342
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:30,239
the sweet spot in the middle you see

2343
01:19:28,238 --> 01:19:31,359
mineralization you see immobilization

2344
01:19:30,238 --> 01:19:33,039
well obviously

2345
01:19:31,359 --> 01:19:34,960
mobilization means it's slow to break

2346
01:19:33,039 --> 01:19:36,000
down well the sweet spot in the middle

2347
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:38,239
is equilibrium

2348
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:40,158
you go down to the middle where it says

2349
01:19:38,238 --> 01:19:41,119
20 to one and i want to focus on this

2350
01:19:40,158 --> 01:19:43,039
one

2351
01:19:41,119 --> 01:19:44,800
that in my mind is a sweet spot a little

2352
01:19:43,039 --> 01:19:47,198
bit more available

2353
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:48,079
but not not going to be like mobile in

2354
01:19:47,198 --> 01:19:50,479
any way

2355
01:19:48,079 --> 01:19:52,238
they use the term rotten manure that's

2356
01:19:50,479 --> 01:19:55,119
that's not responsible it's not

2357
01:19:52,238 --> 01:19:56,000
rotten rotten would mean it's stunk or

2358
01:19:55,119 --> 01:19:58,479
it was fresh

2359
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:59,760
all right it's it's composted manure

2360
01:19:58,479 --> 01:20:02,879
aged manure

2361
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:03,280
and this is where a gentleman friend of

2362
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:05,840
mine

2363
01:20:03,279 --> 01:20:07,759
or client ran into a problem because the

2364
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:10,560
compost that he received

2365
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:12,239
was not mature it had it had a too high

2366
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:14,400
of a c to n ratio

2367
01:20:12,238 --> 01:20:16,879
so it was extremely mobile and it burnt

2368
01:20:14,399 --> 01:20:18,399
his plants and roots

2369
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:20,079
so that's something that you really need

2370
01:20:18,399 --> 01:20:22,879
to keep in mind when you're purchasing

2371
01:20:20,079 --> 01:20:26,158
compost make sure that you get the most

2372
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:27,119
accurate test data you can i personally

2373
01:20:26,158 --> 01:20:30,559
when i'm gonna

2374
01:20:27,119 --> 01:20:32,319
buy compost in in volume i go to the

2375
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:34,880
place where i'm going to purchase it

2376
01:20:32,319 --> 01:20:36,158
i tell them to make me a pile of it and

2377
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:39,279
and don't touch it

2378
01:20:36,158 --> 01:20:41,279
i mark it in my mind i remember how how

2379
01:20:39,279 --> 01:20:43,039
much volume was there

2380
01:20:41,279 --> 01:20:44,479
and i personally sent it out for a soil

2381
01:20:43,039 --> 01:20:46,399
test

2382
01:20:44,479 --> 01:20:47,839
and that's what i'm looking for it's a c

2383
01:20:46,399 --> 01:20:50,319
down ratio

2384
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:52,159
the maturity level um which is the c den

2385
01:20:50,319 --> 01:20:55,439
ratio so again if it's

2386
01:20:52,158 --> 01:20:57,279
if it's if it's too uh high in

2387
01:20:55,439 --> 01:20:59,919
carbon it's going to take forever for it

2388
01:20:57,279 --> 01:21:01,920
to break down which is a slow release

2389
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:04,880
and if it's too

2390
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:06,480
low in carbon c-dan ratio then it's

2391
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:06,960
immature it's hot it's going to fry

2392
01:21:06,479 --> 01:21:08,799
things

2393
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:10,000
it's going to heat up and you don't want

2394
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:12,480
any of those to happen

2395
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:13,679
around your plants so take your time on

2396
01:21:12,479 --> 01:21:15,198
the slide i mean

2397
01:21:13,679 --> 01:21:18,000
right in the middle there is your is

2398
01:21:15,198 --> 01:21:19,198
your composted or aged manure and your

2399
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:21,520
compost

2400
01:21:19,198 --> 01:21:22,879
um you need something quick fast you

2401
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:24,239
know you got clover and vetch which are

2402
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:25,840
a little bit slower

2403
01:21:24,238 --> 01:21:27,599
to move through the soil system but they

2404
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:29,760
will give you a bump out of the gate

2405
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:31,039
and then of course straw is we all know

2406
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:32,400
the benefits of straw i've seen

2407
01:21:31,039 --> 01:21:34,319
tremendous amount of straw used in the

2408
01:21:32,399 --> 01:21:38,000
cannabis production industry

2409
01:21:34,319 --> 01:21:41,359
as a way to prevent soil from drying out

2410
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:43,600
and prevent prevent

2411
01:21:41,359 --> 01:21:44,960
uh ground cover uh from from coming up

2412
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:47,840
and creeping into

2413
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:48,319
uh or weeds to causing problems now and

2414
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:50,239
the

2415
01:21:48,319 --> 01:21:52,238
best part about straw is it breaks down

2416
01:21:50,238 --> 01:21:53,759
slow um as a matter of fact i'm working

2417
01:21:52,238 --> 01:21:56,479
on a strawberry project out here which

2418
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:59,280
i'm really excited uh harry's berries

2419
01:21:56,479 --> 01:22:01,198
they're sold actually nationally um and

2420
01:21:59,279 --> 01:22:04,238
we've tried to come up with a

2421
01:22:01,198 --> 01:22:04,879
alternative to plastic mulches there's

2422
01:22:04,238 --> 01:22:08,079
20

2423
01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:09,039
000 acres of plastic double layered

2424
01:22:08,079 --> 01:22:11,760
plastic mulch

2425
01:22:09,039 --> 01:22:13,279
being used right around me here and to

2426
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:14,320
be able to take that off the shelf would

2427
01:22:13,279 --> 01:22:15,599
be wonderful

2428
01:22:14,319 --> 01:22:17,198
but that's why they call them

2429
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:18,079
strawberries because they had to have

2430
01:22:17,198 --> 01:22:20,079
the straw

2431
01:22:18,079 --> 01:22:21,119
underneath the peri plant so when the

2432
01:22:20,079 --> 01:22:23,439
berry

2433
01:22:21,119 --> 01:22:24,399
grew if it wouldn't touch the soil if it

2434
01:22:23,439 --> 01:22:25,919
touched the soil

2435
01:22:24,399 --> 01:22:27,759
the bacteria would start to consume it

2436
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:29,840
and the berry was no good so straw has

2437
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:32,960
always been a wonderful

2438
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:34,639
material that is is very immobile and

2439
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:36,560
does provide long-term

2440
01:22:34,639 --> 01:22:38,000
fungal food as well as some biological

2441
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:40,880
foods so

2442
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:43,198
definitely keep this c-dan ratios in

2443
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:43,199
mind

2444
01:22:44,238 --> 01:22:50,238
humic acid um all right i love this

2445
01:22:47,679 --> 01:22:51,600
product it has so many benefits

2446
01:22:50,238 --> 01:22:53,519
and we're gonna we're gonna try to

2447
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:56,639
define it so

2448
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:59,600
hemic acid is still very uh

2449
01:22:56,639 --> 01:23:01,359
difficult to describe we don't know all

2450
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:03,360
of the properties of it

2451
01:23:01,359 --> 01:23:04,719
what we do know is there's three forms

2452
01:23:03,359 --> 01:23:06,880
of this organic acid

2453
01:23:04,719 --> 01:23:07,760
one is human acid believe it or not

2454
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:10,719
that's that's

2455
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:12,639
that's fact then we have humic acid

2456
01:23:10,719 --> 01:23:14,239
which is a smaller fraction of the

2457
01:23:12,639 --> 01:23:16,560
molecule and then lastly

2458
01:23:14,238 --> 01:23:18,559
we have fulvic acid so it goes in that

2459
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:22,159
order from large to small

2460
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:24,960
human human has uh wonderful properties

2461
01:23:22,158 --> 01:23:25,920
in building soil structure but does not

2462
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:28,800
have a lot of

2463
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:30,560
other benefits other than that um it's

2464
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:32,239
very slow to break down

2465
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:33,840
which again is good when you're trying

2466
01:23:32,238 --> 01:23:35,839
to build aggregation

2467
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:36,880
but again it doesn't have a lot of other

2468
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:40,079
properties

2469
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:40,880
that humic and folic do the thing you

2470
01:23:40,079 --> 01:23:43,359
need to understand

2471
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:45,760
is the vast majority of himic acids are

2472
01:23:43,359 --> 01:23:46,559
mine so it's basically ledodite or brown

2473
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:48,400
coal

2474
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:50,560
that they take out of the ground and

2475
01:23:48,399 --> 01:23:53,039
then they use acids and bases

2476
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:54,560
to break that down into a liquid or

2477
01:23:53,039 --> 01:23:56,639
powder form

2478
01:23:54,560 --> 01:23:58,800
i'm not a big fan of that process

2479
01:23:56,639 --> 01:24:00,880
because what is the residual

2480
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:02,560
what what are these industrial acids and

2481
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:04,960
bases they're using and

2482
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:06,480
how much is it coming through in the

2483
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:08,800
product how much is that product

2484
01:24:06,479 --> 01:24:11,599
contaminated with those things

2485
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:13,679
i love bio-ag dr faust has done some

2486
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:15,440
amazing work over the years

2487
01:24:13,679 --> 01:24:16,960
as a matter of fact he's kind of the guy

2488
01:24:15,439 --> 01:24:20,000
that pioneered

2489
01:24:16,960 --> 01:24:21,198
humic acid um here in america

2490
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:24,000
they've been doing a tremendous amount

2491
01:24:21,198 --> 01:24:26,319
of work on this over in russia for years

2492
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:28,000
and when he kept running into dead end

2493
01:24:26,319 --> 01:24:29,359
after dead end here in america trying to

2494
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:29,600
find people that had been working with

2495
01:24:29,359 --> 01:24:32,238
it

2496
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:33,600
studying it he ended up going to russia

2497
01:24:32,238 --> 01:24:34,479
and start working with the russian

2498
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:36,960
scientists

2499
01:24:34,479 --> 01:24:37,759
um to to up his game to understand more

2500
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:40,880
about this

2501
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:43,119
and and how to go about getting it um

2502
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:45,199
and he did some amazing work with it and

2503
01:24:43,119 --> 01:24:46,158
what he quickly realized was there are

2504
01:24:45,198 --> 01:24:49,359
certain

2505
01:24:46,158 --> 01:24:50,479
pockets or veins within the lennodite or

2506
01:24:49,359 --> 01:24:53,599
the brown coal

2507
01:24:50,479 --> 01:24:55,439
that have value and others have no value

2508
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:56,880
and that's the problem with humic acid

2509
01:24:55,439 --> 01:24:58,638
is you don't know

2510
01:24:56,880 --> 01:25:00,719
because we don't have enough data and

2511
01:24:58,639 --> 01:25:01,920
research on it whether this is going to

2512
01:25:00,719 --> 01:25:04,399
work or not

2513
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:05,199
and that's why i love faust because he's

2514
01:25:04,399 --> 01:25:07,198
done the work

2515
01:25:05,198 --> 01:25:08,799
and he's done the trials and he

2516
01:25:07,198 --> 01:25:11,599
understands

2517
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:12,000
where if he just goes off a meter in his

2518
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:13,120
mining

2519
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:15,198
process that he's going to have a

2520
01:25:13,119 --> 01:25:15,599
problem the other thing he's done is

2521
01:25:15,198 --> 01:25:18,158
he's

2522
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:19,600
introduced biological decomposition or

2523
01:25:18,158 --> 01:25:21,759
fermentation

2524
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:23,039
to release the the humic acid and the

2525
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:24,560
folic acids

2526
01:25:23,039 --> 01:25:27,279
so if you want to buy something off the

2527
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:29,679
shelf i highly recommend you use those

2528
01:25:27,279 --> 01:25:30,639
i mean there was a there was a huge you

2529
01:25:29,679 --> 01:25:32,719
know

2530
01:25:30,639 --> 01:25:34,079
gold rush for lack of better words when

2531
01:25:32,719 --> 01:25:36,079
when humic acid really

2532
01:25:34,079 --> 01:25:37,359
started to become uh popular and people

2533
01:25:36,079 --> 01:25:39,198
became aware of it

2534
01:25:37,359 --> 01:25:40,639
a lot of big boys jumped in the game and

2535
01:25:39,198 --> 01:25:41,839
started ripping up the surface of the

2536
01:25:40,639 --> 01:25:44,639
earth and pulling out

2537
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:46,159
these coals and you know acid base and

2538
01:25:44,639 --> 01:25:47,679
hell out of them with no understanding

2539
01:25:46,158 --> 01:25:48,719
as to whether that product was going to

2540
01:25:47,679 --> 01:25:50,319
work or not

2541
01:25:48,719 --> 01:25:53,520
and after they've invested all that

2542
01:25:50,319 --> 01:25:54,799
money in in mining it and producing it

2543
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:56,639
don't tell me they're not going to sell

2544
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:57,679
it because it doesn't work they are

2545
01:25:56,639 --> 01:25:58,480
they're going to they're going to lie

2546
01:25:57,679 --> 01:26:00,880
cheat and steal

2547
01:25:58,479 --> 01:26:02,158
so you really again need to know your

2548
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:06,239
source of this

2549
01:26:02,158 --> 01:26:08,238
if you're going to purchase it

2550
01:26:06,238 --> 01:26:10,399
soil building structure i talked earlier

2551
01:26:08,238 --> 01:26:13,519
about my work with james stillow

2552
01:26:10,399 --> 01:26:16,479
and how we were able to achieve a

2553
01:26:13,520 --> 01:26:18,480
wonderful surface aggregation very

2554
01:26:16,479 --> 01:26:20,079
quickly with the application of the

2555
01:26:18,479 --> 01:26:22,879
humic acid that i made

2556
01:26:20,079 --> 01:26:23,679
again i'm making it by stripping compost

2557
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:26,800
so i'm

2558
01:26:23,679 --> 01:26:30,079
stripping it off of the biomass of

2559
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:31,039
of a well-made compost so it is a

2560
01:26:30,079 --> 01:26:34,319
plant-based

2561
01:26:31,039 --> 01:26:37,519
fresh umic acid is not mined so

2562
01:26:34,319 --> 01:26:38,960
more more uh regenerative and anybody

2563
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:40,320
can do this at home there's a number of

2564
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:42,719
different ways i mean you

2565
01:26:40,319 --> 01:26:46,079
i've seen guys you know use everything

2566
01:26:42,719 --> 01:26:46,960
from 55 gallon drums plastic drums pvc

2567
01:26:46,079 --> 01:26:50,158
pipe and they just

2568
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:52,239
pack it with with either compost or or

2569
01:26:50,158 --> 01:26:54,238
leaf mold which is basically ground up

2570
01:26:52,238 --> 01:26:56,319
leaves um and or or just

2571
01:26:54,238 --> 01:26:57,919
you know inoculate or just stuff duff

2572
01:26:56,319 --> 01:26:58,639
around the property around the yard

2573
01:26:57,920 --> 01:27:00,880
mulches

2574
01:26:58,639 --> 01:27:02,480
whatever browns they can find soak it in

2575
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:05,199
water for a couple of days

2576
01:27:02,479 --> 01:27:06,879
and then pour it off or press it and

2577
01:27:05,198 --> 01:27:07,198
either of these techniques will provide

2578
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:10,159
you

2579
01:27:07,198 --> 01:27:10,879
with a uh a homemade source of humic

2580
01:27:10,158 --> 01:27:12,638
acid

2581
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:15,039
and you can get crazy you can put it in

2582
01:27:12,639 --> 01:27:15,679
a in a five gallon compound bucket and

2583
01:27:15,039 --> 01:27:18,800
use a

2584
01:27:15,679 --> 01:27:19,359
mortar mixer and a cordless drill and

2585
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:20,880
and just

2586
01:27:19,359 --> 01:27:23,679
beat it up for a little while and you

2587
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:24,400
will make this this homemade humic acid

2588
01:27:23,679 --> 01:27:26,480
and

2589
01:27:24,399 --> 01:27:27,679
if you have good compost or if you have

2590
01:27:26,479 --> 01:27:29,359
good biology in

2591
01:27:27,679 --> 01:27:31,679
in the materials that you went in there

2592
01:27:29,359 --> 01:27:34,319
guess what you get all those as a bonus

2593
01:27:31,679 --> 01:27:36,239
so i i would encourage you to you know

2594
01:27:34,319 --> 01:27:37,599
do do it yourself at home

2595
01:27:36,238 --> 01:27:39,198
but if you're on a large scale that

2596
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:40,400
might not be possible and therefore you

2597
01:27:39,198 --> 01:27:41,119
might need to purchase some of this

2598
01:27:40,399 --> 01:27:43,519
stuff

2599
01:27:41,119 --> 01:27:45,599
i would i would send you to a bio ag and

2600
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:48,400
dr faust's products

2601
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:48,880
another nice product or benefit of humic

2602
01:27:48,399 --> 01:27:51,279
acid

2603
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:52,960
is it releases calcium we all know how

2604
01:27:51,279 --> 01:27:55,759
critical calcium is

2605
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:56,800
in the soil and if you had a calcium

2606
01:27:55,760 --> 01:27:59,440
carbonate sand

2607
01:27:56,800 --> 01:28:00,880
and you added hemic acid guess what

2608
01:27:59,439 --> 01:28:01,599
you're releasing the calcium plant

2609
01:28:00,880 --> 01:28:03,119
available

2610
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:05,120
um again you don't want to do too much

2611
01:28:03,119 --> 01:28:06,559
of this it's not about more is better

2612
01:28:05,119 --> 01:28:09,760
don't be a moron

2613
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:11,440
um less is better go low and slow and

2614
01:28:09,760 --> 01:28:14,159
watch for weight for plant reaction

2615
01:28:11,439 --> 01:28:15,359
before you uh continue

2616
01:28:14,158 --> 01:28:18,000
that way you won't get in too much

2617
01:28:15,359 --> 01:28:19,839
trouble um hemic acid is also a

2618
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:22,639
wonderful biostimulant

2619
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:24,000
so it provides food sources for biology

2620
01:28:22,639 --> 01:28:26,239
it helps to strengthen

2621
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:28,399
uh the acids in the cell walls or the

2622
01:28:26,238 --> 01:28:30,638
acids enzymes in the cell

2623
01:28:28,399 --> 01:28:32,799
as well as the cell wall fulvic acid is

2624
01:28:30,639 --> 01:28:34,480
better at them than humic acid but we'll

2625
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:36,480
talk about that in a minute

2626
01:28:34,479 --> 01:28:37,599
um and yeah the plant can uptake it so

2627
01:28:36,479 --> 01:28:40,000
it it has you know

2628
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:42,079
tremendous value i can't it go that

2629
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:43,439
benefits go on and on humic acid is just

2630
01:28:42,079 --> 01:28:45,519
a wonderful product

2631
01:28:43,439 --> 01:28:48,399
in everything from soil structure

2632
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:50,719
through plant health through cell health

2633
01:28:48,399 --> 01:28:51,920
another thing that this does is water

2634
01:28:50,719 --> 01:28:56,399
bridging i mentioned

2635
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:59,920
that water molecules are used as a

2636
01:28:56,399 --> 01:29:02,799
method to transporting signals across

2637
01:28:59,920 --> 01:29:04,319
cell cell wall or not cell walls but in

2638
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:07,520
internally in the cell

2639
01:29:04,319 --> 01:29:09,599
and also externally they can cellular

2640
01:29:07,520 --> 01:29:12,719
communication can happen

2641
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:15,520
from one water molecule to the next

2642
01:29:12,719 --> 01:29:16,560
and by water bridging it's kind of like

2643
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:18,560
surfactants

2644
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:19,920
so if any of you used a surfactant

2645
01:29:18,560 --> 01:29:22,480
you've noticed that the

2646
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:22,960
water does not bead up on the leaf it

2647
01:29:22,479 --> 01:29:25,359
actually

2648
01:29:22,960 --> 01:29:27,198
coats the leaf evenly so that that's

2649
01:29:25,359 --> 01:29:30,000
what's called water bridging

2650
01:29:27,198 --> 01:29:32,079
and chemic acid is a wonderful product

2651
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:35,119
to

2652
01:29:32,079 --> 01:29:36,079
help to facilitate water bridging like a

2653
01:29:35,119 --> 01:29:39,519
surfactant is

2654
01:29:36,079 --> 01:29:42,559
so it's almost a natural surfactant um

2655
01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:44,159
and then again the fourth phase of water

2656
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:46,080
i really think that this is important

2657
01:29:44,158 --> 01:29:47,119
that and again keep your open mind don't

2658
01:29:46,079 --> 01:29:49,039
listen to the haters

2659
01:29:47,119 --> 01:29:50,719
there's there's definite information

2660
01:29:49,039 --> 01:29:53,519
here that is a value

2661
01:29:50,719 --> 01:29:55,119
and i think you know as we as a species

2662
01:29:53,520 --> 01:29:57,840
move forward in life we'll understand a

2663
01:29:55,119 --> 01:30:01,198
lot more about the properties of water

2664
01:29:57,840 --> 01:30:02,960
as as science catches up with uh

2665
01:30:01,198 --> 01:30:07,839
you know our present knowledge or

2666
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:07,840
surpasses our present knowledge

2667
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:14,319
fulvic acid this one is the

2668
01:30:11,039 --> 01:30:17,039
has a very very low molecular weight

2669
01:30:14,319 --> 01:30:18,840
what that means is that it's very easily

2670
01:30:17,039 --> 01:30:22,158
metabolized into

2671
01:30:18,840 --> 01:30:25,760
cells both living human animal

2672
01:30:22,158 --> 01:30:27,359
mammal and plant cells and bacterial

2673
01:30:25,760 --> 01:30:29,119
what it does is it helps to build the

2674
01:30:27,359 --> 01:30:30,880
cell wall strength which is really

2675
01:30:29,119 --> 01:30:34,399
important especially for plants

2676
01:30:30,880 --> 01:30:37,359
um it's a wonderful foliate

2677
01:30:34,399 --> 01:30:38,399
and more importantly it also provides a

2678
01:30:37,359 --> 01:30:42,158
higher level

2679
01:30:38,399 --> 01:30:43,599
of enzyme or acid within the enzyme to

2680
01:30:42,158 --> 01:30:45,439
break down things so

2681
01:30:43,600 --> 01:30:47,039
we have that little bacteria hanging out

2682
01:30:45,439 --> 01:30:48,079
on that grain of sand and it's trying to

2683
01:30:47,039 --> 01:30:50,560
just pull that silica

2684
01:30:48,079 --> 01:30:52,639
out release the oxygen well it's going

2685
01:30:50,560 --> 01:30:53,920
to need some strong acids or enzymes and

2686
01:30:52,639 --> 01:30:58,079
it's in its uh

2687
01:30:53,920 --> 01:31:01,440
and it's in its um inside of itself

2688
01:30:58,079 --> 01:31:04,000
so this is a great way to add you know

2689
01:31:01,439 --> 01:31:05,039
a tremendous amount of value and health

2690
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:07,439
to your plant

2691
01:31:05,039 --> 01:31:10,000
um the dilution ratio is usually like 1

2692
01:31:07,439 --> 01:31:12,559
to 100 so this is like a

2693
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:13,840
natural farming preparation you're not

2694
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:15,120
using this in strength

2695
01:31:13,840 --> 01:31:17,760
if you do use it in strength you're

2696
01:31:15,119 --> 01:31:18,479
wasting it but the good news is if you

2697
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:20,639
spray it and

2698
01:31:18,479 --> 01:31:22,238
some of it drips off your plant it's not

2699
01:31:20,639 --> 01:31:24,000
going to hurt anything it's going to

2700
01:31:22,238 --> 01:31:25,119
actually add benefit to the soil

2701
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:28,000
microbes

2702
01:31:25,119 --> 01:31:30,158
it's not it's not a great soil structure

2703
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:33,119
builder like the humic is

2704
01:31:30,158 --> 01:31:36,319
but it's definitely a food source for

2705
01:31:33,119 --> 01:31:39,198
all the bacteria and all the biology

2706
01:31:36,319 --> 01:31:40,399
and to understand you know what is

2707
01:31:39,198 --> 01:31:42,399
fulvic acid well

2708
01:31:40,399 --> 01:31:44,319
because it has the lowest atomic weight

2709
01:31:42,399 --> 01:31:46,158
of any of the other organic acids that

2710
01:31:44,319 --> 01:31:48,719
we just talked about

2711
01:31:46,158 --> 01:31:49,839
means that it's really the very end of

2712
01:31:48,719 --> 01:31:53,520
decomposition

2713
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:54,880
so it came from a plant it came from

2714
01:31:53,520 --> 01:31:57,360
organic matter

2715
01:31:54,880 --> 01:31:58,159
so in some cases animals and plants are

2716
01:31:57,359 --> 01:32:00,639
both organic

2717
01:31:58,158 --> 01:32:01,920
matter as they break down so this is the

2718
01:32:00,639 --> 01:32:05,119
very end

2719
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:07,760
of the cycle and so

2720
01:32:05,119 --> 01:32:09,519
in using common sense to think well if i

2721
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:11,199
get this at the very end of the cycle

2722
01:32:09,520 --> 01:32:12,719
it's going to be very beneficial to the

2723
01:32:11,198 --> 01:32:14,399
beginning of the cycle

2724
01:32:12,719 --> 01:32:16,399
and it's like everything in life it's a

2725
01:32:14,399 --> 01:32:18,238
closed loop and so this is

2726
01:32:16,399 --> 01:32:20,719
understanding that this is the very end

2727
01:32:18,238 --> 01:32:22,399
of it means that it's probably got great

2728
01:32:20,719 --> 01:32:24,319
value for the beginning of it and that

2729
01:32:22,399 --> 01:32:25,519
means so as your plants are growing to

2730
01:32:24,319 --> 01:32:26,880
apply a little bit of this at the

2731
01:32:25,520 --> 01:32:28,800
correct pollution

2732
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:30,880
is a wonderful way to really strengthen

2733
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:31,440
the plant and give it an extra little

2734
01:32:30,880 --> 01:32:33,920
bump

2735
01:32:31,439 --> 01:32:35,119
um from you know worrying about pest

2736
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:37,520
attraction or

2737
01:32:35,119 --> 01:32:38,719
or molds or any of these other things so

2738
01:32:37,520 --> 01:32:40,000
super healthy plant

2739
01:32:38,719 --> 01:32:42,000
chances are you're not going to have the

2740
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:43,039
kind of pest pressure or issues that you

2741
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:45,679
would if your plant was

2742
01:32:43,039 --> 01:32:46,960
was not as healthy on the doubt in the

2743
01:32:45,679 --> 01:32:47,840
picture i just wanted you to see the

2744
01:32:46,960 --> 01:32:50,000
color of it

2745
01:32:47,840 --> 01:32:53,440
the color is a little bit off uh in the

2746
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:55,439
slide it's not orangey it's more like

2747
01:32:53,439 --> 01:32:57,279
amber like like if you looked at a

2748
01:32:55,439 --> 01:32:58,960
crystal of amber

2749
01:32:57,279 --> 01:33:01,119
in the sunlight you would see that that

2750
01:32:58,960 --> 01:33:02,800
golden yellow color

2751
01:33:01,119 --> 01:33:04,559
that's what it really looks like if it's

2752
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:07,760
in its purest form

2753
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:09,760
how i get folic acid is basically after

2754
01:33:07,760 --> 01:33:10,639
i've washed the compost i screen it kind

2755
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:13,840
of like

2756
01:33:10,639 --> 01:33:15,600
making bubble hash i use 47 micron and

2757
01:33:13,840 --> 01:33:19,039
120 micron screens

2758
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:20,000
to trap the hemis humates in particulate

2759
01:33:19,039 --> 01:33:22,719
that i'm looking for

2760
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:23,840
that are super biologically charged or

2761
01:33:22,719 --> 01:33:26,239
or

2762
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:28,319
their the biology is set up on these

2763
01:33:26,238 --> 01:33:32,000
little tiny pieces of

2764
01:33:28,319 --> 01:33:34,799
organic matter and so i've i've gotten

2765
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:36,000
all the humic acid off of them through

2766
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:38,880
the drying and screening

2767
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:40,719
process i use a vibrating screen and

2768
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:45,039
then i take that

2769
01:33:40,719 --> 01:33:48,399
semi wet solid and i put it into a press

2770
01:33:45,039 --> 01:33:49,679
and i use again a 47 micron stainless

2771
01:33:48,399 --> 01:33:51,519
steel screen

2772
01:33:49,679 --> 01:33:52,719
and wrap it up and then press it and

2773
01:33:51,520 --> 01:33:55,679
what comes out of there

2774
01:33:52,719 --> 01:33:57,119
is just pure fulvic acid so plant

2775
01:33:55,679 --> 01:33:59,199
derived fulvic acid

2776
01:33:57,119 --> 01:34:00,719
so you too can make this product at your

2777
01:33:59,198 --> 01:34:02,399
home if you

2778
01:34:00,719 --> 01:34:04,719
if you again if you're large scale you

2779
01:34:02,399 --> 01:34:07,279
don't have the capacity to do it then

2780
01:34:04,719 --> 01:34:09,198
go with dr faust's full plus he can't

2781
01:34:07,279 --> 01:34:10,719
even call it fulvic acid because we do

2782
01:34:09,198 --> 01:34:12,559
not acknowledge that name here in

2783
01:34:10,719 --> 01:34:15,439
america believe it or not

2784
01:34:12,560 --> 01:34:16,800
in our arrogance and stupidity but yes

2785
01:34:15,439 --> 01:34:19,919
you can make this at home it's not

2786
01:34:16,800 --> 01:34:21,840
it's not impossible and that is going to

2787
01:34:19,920 --> 01:34:25,119
be a way more regenerative

2788
01:34:21,840 --> 01:34:29,119
uh way more plan available form than the

2789
01:34:25,119 --> 01:34:29,119
ones that are mined to acids and bases

2790
01:34:31,198 --> 01:34:35,599
living soil so you know that's the whole

2791
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:39,279
point of this conversation

2792
01:34:35,600 --> 01:34:41,440
is is how to achieve living soils um

2793
01:34:39,279 --> 01:34:42,559
and we've talked about soilless versus

2794
01:34:41,439 --> 01:34:45,759
horizonal

2795
01:34:42,560 --> 01:34:49,119
um is it is it possible to achieve

2796
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:52,560
living soils in a soilless mix well i

2797
01:34:49,118 --> 01:34:53,759
said two years ago i didn't think it was

2798
01:34:52,560 --> 01:34:56,320
possible

2799
01:34:53,760 --> 01:34:57,600
but i was proven wrong i highly

2800
01:34:56,319 --> 01:35:01,359
recommend you guys

2801
01:34:57,600 --> 01:35:04,400
start following liberty on ig

2802
01:35:01,359 --> 01:35:06,639
that's l-i-v-i-t-y

2803
01:35:04,399 --> 01:35:08,879
it's a crew back east in rhode island

2804
01:35:06,639 --> 01:35:11,359
that is doing some amazing medical

2805
01:35:08,880 --> 01:35:13,840
cannabis production in 100 organic

2806
01:35:11,359 --> 01:35:15,759
living soil systems

2807
01:35:13,840 --> 01:35:17,760
started working with them i met them in

2808
01:35:15,760 --> 01:35:21,280
portland four years ago

2809
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:24,000
specifically jeff and some of his crew

2810
01:35:21,279 --> 01:35:24,800
and we chopped it up and he was making

2811
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:27,840
compost

2812
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:30,800
and so later that year he invited me to

2813
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:32,800
get together and have a conversation

2814
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:34,480
and we started looking at his compost

2815
01:35:32,800 --> 01:35:37,760
and started looking at his

2816
01:35:34,479 --> 01:35:40,238
uh his soil systems and

2817
01:35:37,760 --> 01:35:41,280
i was i was amazed i was like wow this

2818
01:35:40,238 --> 01:35:44,718
is really impressive

2819
01:35:41,279 --> 01:35:47,359
and so he was only missing the the

2820
01:35:44,719 --> 01:35:49,439
um fungi piece of it i mean everything

2821
01:35:47,359 --> 01:35:51,359
else was in play he had protozoa

2822
01:35:49,439 --> 01:35:52,479
he had you know both the flagellates and

2823
01:35:51,359 --> 01:35:54,319
amoebas

2824
01:35:52,479 --> 01:35:55,678
some nematodes that was uh that was

2825
01:35:54,319 --> 01:35:57,359
another thing that we encouraged him to

2826
01:35:55,679 --> 01:35:59,760
get some more of those involved

2827
01:35:57,359 --> 01:36:00,399
um but his f to b ratio was a little bit

2828
01:35:59,760 --> 01:36:03,520
low

2829
01:36:00,399 --> 01:36:04,879
so i had him go out and and sample

2830
01:36:03,520 --> 01:36:07,040
a bunch of different piles that he'd

2831
01:36:04,880 --> 01:36:08,480
been making over the years to see if he

2832
01:36:07,039 --> 01:36:11,039
had any that were really fungally

2833
01:36:08,479 --> 01:36:12,238
dominant and he did and so i encouraged

2834
01:36:11,039 --> 01:36:14,000
him to screen that

2835
01:36:12,238 --> 01:36:15,519
and start top dressing that on all his

2836
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:17,600
plants and he did and

2837
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:19,199
if you look at the pictures the bud porn

2838
01:36:17,600 --> 01:36:22,719
that's coming off of that um

2839
01:36:19,198 --> 01:36:24,638
that ig site it's impressive and

2840
01:36:22,719 --> 01:36:26,480
yeah i've enjoyed the flowers well it's

2841
01:36:24,639 --> 01:36:29,039
it's it's wonderful stuff

2842
01:36:26,479 --> 01:36:30,000
uh full of love and and and hard work

2843
01:36:29,039 --> 01:36:33,439
for sure

2844
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:36,880
but it is possible to achieve um

2845
01:36:33,439 --> 01:36:38,719
a living soil in a soilless medium um

2846
01:36:36,880 --> 01:36:40,639
preferably i still believe that the

2847
01:36:38,719 --> 01:36:41,600
horizontal system is going to be easier

2848
01:36:40,639 --> 01:36:43,520
for people

2849
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:45,039
you're not going to have to manage the

2850
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:47,360
moisture

2851
01:36:45,039 --> 01:36:49,039
as as critically because of the

2852
01:36:47,359 --> 01:36:51,920
forgiveness of the

2853
01:36:49,039 --> 01:36:54,479
profiles or the horizons working with

2854
01:36:51,920 --> 01:36:56,880
you instead of against you

2855
01:36:54,479 --> 01:36:59,439
jeff was able to get away from having

2856
01:36:56,880 --> 01:37:02,319
hydrophobic situations by

2857
01:36:59,439 --> 01:37:02,960
making sure that his his pot tops were

2858
01:37:02,319 --> 01:37:06,079
properly

2859
01:37:02,960 --> 01:37:08,239
uh cover cropped and so

2860
01:37:06,079 --> 01:37:09,840
he he's he's been able to do it but he's

2861
01:37:08,238 --> 01:37:11,439
also in a very highly controlled

2862
01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:12,239
environment so he doesn't have to worry

2863
01:37:11,439 --> 01:37:14,879
about

2864
01:37:12,238 --> 01:37:17,439
um trans evaporation he doesn't have to

2865
01:37:14,880 --> 01:37:20,159
worry about humidity or lack of it

2866
01:37:17,439 --> 01:37:21,198
so that his system is going to be less

2867
01:37:20,158 --> 01:37:22,960
likely

2868
01:37:21,198 --> 01:37:24,559
to get into a situation where it's going

2869
01:37:22,960 --> 01:37:26,800
to go hydrophobic on the soil because

2870
01:37:24,560 --> 01:37:29,920
you don't have those kinds of swings

2871
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:32,159
in moisture level or or humidification

2872
01:37:29,920 --> 01:37:34,158
or dehumidification

2873
01:37:32,158 --> 01:37:35,599
so this is the next really big question

2874
01:37:34,158 --> 01:37:38,960
is to feed

2875
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:39,520
your plant or feed your soil um i truly

2876
01:37:38,960 --> 01:37:42,158
believe

2877
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:44,239
you know based on what i've seen and the

2878
01:37:42,158 --> 01:37:45,039
these foliar nutrients that are becoming

2879
01:37:44,238 --> 01:37:46,638
available and

2880
01:37:45,039 --> 01:37:48,800
again we're going to go down that rabbit

2881
01:37:46,639 --> 01:37:50,079
hole in january as to what's available

2882
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:50,960
and what's working and what's not

2883
01:37:50,079 --> 01:37:54,319
working

2884
01:37:50,960 --> 01:37:57,840
but i've seen i've seen amazing things

2885
01:37:54,319 --> 01:38:02,000
from foliar applications of nutrients

2886
01:37:57,840 --> 01:38:04,639
and the one that i've played with so far

2887
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:06,479
i've seen incredible impact in the

2888
01:38:04,639 --> 01:38:09,440
microbial life as well

2889
01:38:06,479 --> 01:38:10,799
um i i lost a dear friend recently

2890
01:38:09,439 --> 01:38:13,599
michael hinden

2891
01:38:10,800 --> 01:38:16,000
who was working on a wonderful formula

2892
01:38:13,600 --> 01:38:19,119
of amino acid digested

2893
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:21,679
nutrient sources and you know he

2894
01:38:19,118 --> 01:38:24,079
told me about how well it worked on the

2895
01:38:21,679 --> 01:38:27,199
uh foliar application of plants

2896
01:38:24,079 --> 01:38:28,399
so i had to try it at soil that's just

2897
01:38:27,198 --> 01:38:31,519
who i am

2898
01:38:28,399 --> 01:38:33,920
so i built uh two compost piles

2899
01:38:31,520 --> 01:38:34,719
or made one compost pile i split it into

2900
01:38:33,920 --> 01:38:37,118
two

2901
01:38:34,719 --> 01:38:38,880
um checked it of course it was you know

2902
01:38:37,118 --> 01:38:39,920
producing a wonderful level of uh

2903
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:43,118
biology

2904
01:38:39,920 --> 01:38:46,399
uh diverse biology and so uh

2905
01:38:43,118 --> 01:38:48,479
at week two i added his nutrient pack to

2906
01:38:46,399 --> 01:38:50,319
one of the bullets and the other one i

2907
01:38:48,479 --> 01:38:51,359
left alone or just added water as

2908
01:38:50,319 --> 01:38:54,639
necessary

2909
01:38:51,359 --> 01:38:58,399
um and i checked it on week three

2910
01:38:54,639 --> 01:39:01,840
and four and he had outperformed me

2911
01:38:58,399 --> 01:39:04,158
uh or my system in in

2912
01:39:01,840 --> 01:39:06,000
generating uh organisms protozoa

2913
01:39:04,158 --> 01:39:09,279
nematodes etc so

2914
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:12,639
his nutrient solution had benefit

2915
01:39:09,279 --> 01:39:15,118
to the biology as well as the plant so

2916
01:39:12,639 --> 01:39:16,800
in my mind that's a win-win so why

2917
01:39:15,118 --> 01:39:18,639
wouldn't you feed the soil and why

2918
01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:19,600
wouldn't you feed the plant and anything

2919
01:39:18,639 --> 01:39:21,760
that you've

2920
01:39:19,600 --> 01:39:22,719
fed the plant in excess will feed the

2921
01:39:21,760 --> 01:39:25,760
soil

2922
01:39:22,719 --> 01:39:28,880
but i'm not saying don't feed the soil

2923
01:39:25,760 --> 01:39:32,000
also please include those you know those

2924
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:34,000
crab shell and those oyster meals don't

2925
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:36,880
do it in excess don't be a moron

2926
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:38,158
and again test and appropriately amend

2927
01:39:36,880 --> 01:39:41,600
and i think that if you

2928
01:39:38,158 --> 01:39:43,679
maintain that ideal level of nutritional

2929
01:39:41,600 --> 01:39:46,239
value in your soil system whether it's

2930
01:39:43,679 --> 01:39:48,399
horizontal or soilless

2931
01:39:46,238 --> 01:39:50,479
you are in a better sweet spot than you

2932
01:39:48,399 --> 01:39:53,198
are if you're either deficient

2933
01:39:50,479 --> 01:39:54,718
or you're over abundant in something we

2934
01:39:53,198 --> 01:39:55,359
all know what newt lock looks like it's

2935
01:39:54,719 --> 01:39:58,480
not pretty

2936
01:39:55,359 --> 01:40:00,158
so you know again test test test and

2937
01:39:58,479 --> 01:40:02,559
amend responsibly

2938
01:40:00,158 --> 01:40:03,599
um but to answer you know the question

2939
01:40:02,560 --> 01:40:06,080
yeah soil

2940
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:09,840
soilless can work i've seen it and um

2941
01:40:06,079 --> 01:40:09,840
there's proof out there

2942
01:40:11,439 --> 01:40:16,399
waters affect at all soils okay so

2943
01:40:14,479 --> 01:40:18,879
again we're going to get into redox

2944
01:40:16,399 --> 01:40:22,479
potential in january

2945
01:40:18,880 --> 01:40:22,719
and its effects on eh so a low eh means

2946
01:40:22,479 --> 01:40:26,000
a

2947
01:40:22,719 --> 01:40:28,158
high level of electron availability um

2948
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:30,639
and water to some degree facilitates

2949
01:40:28,158 --> 01:40:34,479
that um

2950
01:40:30,639 --> 01:40:37,760
the aerometer is a unit or as a device

2951
01:40:34,479 --> 01:40:39,839
it's the brand name for a tentiometer

2952
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:41,440
i'm a big fan of these i'm running

2953
01:40:39,840 --> 01:40:42,880
around installing these things all over

2954
01:40:41,439 --> 01:40:43,759
the place with people i work with

2955
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:46,079
because

2956
01:40:43,760 --> 01:40:46,960
i constantly see over and under and

2957
01:40:46,079 --> 01:40:50,238
watering

2958
01:40:46,960 --> 01:40:53,600
and you know i personally failed water i

2959
01:40:50,238 --> 01:40:54,000
i thought i had it nailed and i went out

2960
01:40:53,600 --> 01:40:56,560
there

2961
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:57,039
i used a neurometer to to figure out

2962
01:40:56,560 --> 01:40:59,679
where

2963
01:40:57,039 --> 01:41:00,238
that sweet spot was and i realized right

2964
01:40:59,679 --> 01:41:02,719
away

2965
01:41:00,238 --> 01:41:03,359
hey i was over watering and so i

2966
01:41:02,719 --> 01:41:06,480
followed

2967
01:41:03,359 --> 01:41:07,759
you know i met used the meter to tell me

2968
01:41:06,479 --> 01:41:11,279
where i should be and

2969
01:41:07,760 --> 01:41:11,840
in the soil system that i have i used an

2970
01:41:11,279 --> 01:41:15,039
rt

2971
01:41:11,840 --> 01:41:16,560
which is for soil 18 inches deep and

2972
01:41:15,039 --> 01:41:18,560
basically the sweet spot is

2973
01:41:16,560 --> 01:41:20,000
40. it for my soil type now if you're

2974
01:41:18,560 --> 01:41:21,840
high clay it's different remember i'm

2975
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:23,920
high sand here i'm in uh

2976
01:41:21,840 --> 01:41:25,520
dune circle off dune street in the

2977
01:41:23,920 --> 01:41:26,480
middle of dunes surrounded being all

2978
01:41:25,520 --> 01:41:30,000
sides

2979
01:41:26,479 --> 01:41:32,000
so um you again you have to be smart

2980
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:34,000
about it and understand the unit the

2981
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:35,279
how to work this piece of instrument but

2982
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:38,560
it's it's really

2983
01:41:35,279 --> 01:41:38,880
low tech do not buy the blue matte one

2984
01:41:38,560 --> 01:41:41,920
the

2985
01:41:38,880 --> 01:41:42,319
the orometer is better um it's more it's

2986
01:41:41,920 --> 01:41:45,440
not

2987
01:41:42,319 --> 01:41:46,000
it's not a digital device it's it's a

2988
01:41:45,439 --> 01:41:48,238
mechanical

2989
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:49,039
device so it has less chances of having

2990
01:41:48,238 --> 01:41:51,198
issues

2991
01:41:49,039 --> 01:41:52,560
um i love blue man to death but that one

2992
01:41:51,198 --> 01:41:54,719
instrument can be

2993
01:41:52,560 --> 01:41:56,000
problematic with that with the sensors

2994
01:41:54,719 --> 01:41:57,439
so

2995
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:59,439
i think they're a wonderful company they

2996
01:41:57,439 --> 01:42:01,439
do a great job don't get me wrong but if

2997
01:41:59,439 --> 01:42:03,519
you're going to spend the money

2998
01:42:01,439 --> 01:42:04,879
please use a neurometer it's just a much

2999
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:08,639
safer

3000
01:42:04,880 --> 01:42:12,079
less likely to give false readings uh

3001
01:42:08,639 --> 01:42:14,239
measure a unit of measurement so anyway

3002
01:42:12,079 --> 01:42:16,399
i was watering i've got it to the sweet

3003
01:42:14,238 --> 01:42:17,519
spot for about three weeks i was surfing

3004
01:42:16,399 --> 01:42:20,079
perfectly

3005
01:42:17,520 --> 01:42:21,840
uh through you know when it go up a

3006
01:42:20,079 --> 01:42:23,439
little bit so as it goes up that means

3007
01:42:21,840 --> 01:42:24,800
it's getting drier as it goes down it

3008
01:42:23,439 --> 01:42:28,399
means it's getting wetter

3009
01:42:24,800 --> 01:42:29,920
so i go up a little say to 43 44 i'd hit

3010
01:42:28,399 --> 01:42:30,399
it with four minutes of watering it

3011
01:42:29,920 --> 01:42:32,960
would drop

3012
01:42:30,399 --> 01:42:34,079
just down below 40 and then throughout

3013
01:42:32,960 --> 01:42:35,920
the course of the next day it would

3014
01:42:34,079 --> 01:42:38,960
start to rise up again so i was just

3015
01:42:35,920 --> 01:42:41,118
perfectly surfing back and forth and

3016
01:42:38,960 --> 01:42:43,039
then what happened was one day i got up

3017
01:42:41,118 --> 01:42:44,479
i looked it was 45 i'm like okay i gotta

3018
01:42:43,039 --> 01:42:45,840
do five minutes of watering i did the

3019
01:42:44,479 --> 01:42:48,238
five minutes of watering

3020
01:42:45,840 --> 01:42:49,920
shut the water off went about uh got to

3021
01:42:48,238 --> 01:42:50,718
work and then came back an hour later to

3022
01:42:49,920 --> 01:42:53,199
check it

3023
01:42:50,719 --> 01:42:54,719
and it was all the way down to ten so i

3024
01:42:53,198 --> 01:42:57,279
had way over watered

3025
01:42:54,719 --> 01:42:58,800
and so what was like well how did that

3026
01:42:57,279 --> 01:43:00,399
even happen so i started paying

3027
01:42:58,800 --> 01:43:02,719
attention and looking around

3028
01:43:00,399 --> 01:43:03,920
and i noticed underneath the roof line

3029
01:43:02,719 --> 01:43:06,719
was was

3030
01:43:03,920 --> 01:43:08,880
wet it was all like dripped water kind

3031
01:43:06,719 --> 01:43:12,480
of puddled up and i was like

3032
01:43:08,880 --> 01:43:15,760
that's it we must have had a heavy fog

3033
01:43:12,479 --> 01:43:16,718
or a missed event last night um that i

3034
01:43:15,760 --> 01:43:19,679
didn't know about

3035
01:43:16,719 --> 01:43:20,239
and that water moisture or vapor was

3036
01:43:19,679 --> 01:43:23,279
trapped

3037
01:43:20,238 --> 01:43:24,319
in the top 12 inches but had not had a

3038
01:43:23,279 --> 01:43:27,439
time to get down

3039
01:43:24,319 --> 01:43:29,439
to the the sensor itself and when i

3040
01:43:27,439 --> 01:43:31,439
watered it i just pushed all that water

3041
01:43:29,439 --> 01:43:32,079
down to the sensor and therefore it

3042
01:43:31,439 --> 01:43:34,399
tripped

3043
01:43:32,079 --> 01:43:36,000
so if i had paid attention and looked

3044
01:43:34,399 --> 01:43:38,879
around and realized that there

3045
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:40,560
must have been a fog event and waited

3046
01:43:38,880 --> 01:43:42,319
until later in the day to see

3047
01:43:40,560 --> 01:43:44,239
where my soil measurement was instead of

3048
01:43:42,319 --> 01:43:46,719
just doing it first thing in the morning

3049
01:43:44,238 --> 01:43:48,799
i wouldn't have had that issue so again

3050
01:43:46,719 --> 01:43:50,880
you know watering is critical

3051
01:43:48,800 --> 01:43:52,560
we've talked about it washing fines down

3052
01:43:50,880 --> 01:43:55,600
into the soil profile

3053
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:56,480
uh washing your nutrients away so to get

3054
01:43:55,600 --> 01:43:59,280
a

3055
01:43:56,479 --> 01:44:01,118
perfect balance of water in your soil

3056
01:43:59,279 --> 01:44:04,800
profile so you have 50

3057
01:44:01,118 --> 01:44:07,759
25 oxygen or air 25 percent water

3058
01:44:04,800 --> 01:44:08,480
to go with your 50 physical part of the

3059
01:44:07,760 --> 01:44:12,560
soil

3060
01:44:08,479 --> 01:44:12,559
is ideal and that should be your goal

3061
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:17,359
aquaponics i'm just going to touch

3062
01:44:15,520 --> 01:44:19,040
briefly on this

3063
01:44:17,359 --> 01:44:21,439
you know it is a really cool way of

3064
01:44:19,039 --> 01:44:23,679
growing is a little bit more complicated

3065
01:44:21,439 --> 01:44:26,638
than just growing plants and soil

3066
01:44:23,679 --> 01:44:27,679
i'm a big proponent of of the aquatic

3067
01:44:26,639 --> 01:44:29,760
food web

3068
01:44:27,679 --> 01:44:31,679
that's what i'm all about i'm kingdom

3069
01:44:29,760 --> 01:44:33,199
aquaponics because i'm trying to provide

3070
01:44:31,679 --> 01:44:35,279
all the kingdoms

3071
01:44:33,198 --> 01:44:37,279
in my products to you which includes the

3072
01:44:35,279 --> 01:44:38,639
the aquatics

3073
01:44:37,279 --> 01:44:40,800
we're going to be doing a section in

3074
01:44:38,639 --> 01:44:42,079
january on amos which are aquatic

3075
01:44:40,800 --> 01:44:44,480
microorganisms

3076
01:44:42,079 --> 01:44:45,600
working with some guys back east on a

3077
01:44:44,479 --> 01:44:47,678
fish farm

3078
01:44:45,600 --> 01:44:49,440
the oldest drought fish farm in america

3079
01:44:47,679 --> 01:44:50,800
and the products that are coming out of

3080
01:44:49,439 --> 01:44:53,439
there are amazing

3081
01:44:50,800 --> 01:44:54,480
and he and i have been working for for

3082
01:44:53,439 --> 01:44:57,759
years

3083
01:44:54,479 --> 01:45:01,198
on finding that sweet spot in

3084
01:44:57,760 --> 01:45:04,239
uh keith and i uh on on how to get

3085
01:45:01,198 --> 01:45:05,759
the the product balanced um

3086
01:45:04,238 --> 01:45:08,000
some of the work that i've been doing

3087
01:45:05,760 --> 01:45:10,639
over the years is finding out that

3088
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:12,560
in soil restoration i don't want to just

3089
01:45:10,639 --> 01:45:15,039
go straight aerobic i want to i want to

3090
01:45:12,560 --> 01:45:17,600
work my way up in succession so

3091
01:45:15,039 --> 01:45:18,158
i'll use a semi-anaerobic product out of

3092
01:45:17,600 --> 01:45:19,760
the gate

3093
01:45:18,158 --> 01:45:22,158
and then i'll push it into a more

3094
01:45:19,760 --> 01:45:23,840
aerobic product before i go all the way

3095
01:45:22,158 --> 01:45:25,359
to completely aerobic

3096
01:45:23,840 --> 01:45:28,239
and by doing this i've been able to

3097
01:45:25,359 --> 01:45:30,639
transition dirt into soil really quickly

3098
01:45:28,238 --> 01:45:32,879
but again it's biomimicry i'm following

3099
01:45:30,639 --> 01:45:36,000
i'm following what nature does

3100
01:45:32,880 --> 01:45:37,920
um so we have deep water culture dwc

3101
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:39,760
that's probably the most complicated one

3102
01:45:37,920 --> 01:45:40,158
because what happens is the roots slough

3103
01:45:39,760 --> 01:45:42,480
off

3104
01:45:40,158 --> 01:45:44,879
and and eventually they start to build

3105
01:45:42,479 --> 01:45:47,839
up an anaerobic layer on the bottom

3106
01:45:44,880 --> 01:45:49,039
like a sludge and to offset that they've

3107
01:45:47,840 --> 01:45:50,639
used

3108
01:45:49,039 --> 01:45:52,319
air stones a tremendous amount of air

3109
01:45:50,639 --> 01:45:53,920
stones to build up the do

3110
01:45:52,319 --> 01:45:56,079
but it still does not get rid of the

3111
01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:58,158
anaerobic pocket every so often you have

3112
01:45:56,079 --> 01:46:00,000
to pull the whole thing apart dump all

3113
01:45:58,158 --> 01:46:01,920
the water clean all the muck

3114
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:03,118
put it all back together so it's very

3115
01:46:01,920 --> 01:46:06,000
labor intensive

3116
01:46:03,118 --> 01:46:07,279
so dwc really has not taken off because

3117
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:10,399
of that

3118
01:46:07,279 --> 01:46:12,719
maintenance issue flood and drains is

3119
01:46:10,399 --> 01:46:13,519
is great i like it better than dwc

3120
01:46:12,719 --> 01:46:15,920
although

3121
01:46:13,520 --> 01:46:17,119
i struggle with bell siphons uh i have

3122
01:46:15,920 --> 01:46:17,840
played with a number of different

3123
01:46:17,118 --> 01:46:20,000
designs

3124
01:46:17,840 --> 01:46:21,840
i've tried to modify them themself

3125
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,238
myself and and i've always struggled

3126
01:46:21,840 --> 01:46:23,840
with

3127
01:46:22,238 --> 01:46:25,198
they're just finicky and sometimes

3128
01:46:23,840 --> 01:46:26,480
they're working great and then sometimes

3129
01:46:25,198 --> 01:46:28,719
they just stop

3130
01:46:26,479 --> 01:46:29,839
so again it's kind of difficult system

3131
01:46:28,719 --> 01:46:32,239
to work with

3132
01:46:29,840 --> 01:46:33,119
um when you have the bell siphon the

3133
01:46:32,238 --> 01:46:36,000
dual root zone

3134
01:46:33,118 --> 01:46:37,118
is a cool system it's got a lot less

3135
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,960
issues

3136
01:46:37,118 --> 01:46:41,039
because basically you're just filling it

3137
01:46:38,960 --> 01:46:43,359
up um and draining it down

3138
01:46:41,039 --> 01:46:44,880
and whether you're using a bell siphon

3139
01:46:43,359 --> 01:46:48,238
or just a regular

3140
01:46:44,880 --> 01:46:49,760
manual like plunger for a toilet

3141
01:46:48,238 --> 01:46:51,439
which i think is probably easier than

3142
01:46:49,760 --> 01:46:53,199
the bell siphon um

3143
01:46:51,439 --> 01:46:55,279
and and the beauty of dual root zone is

3144
01:46:53,198 --> 01:46:58,319
it gives you the ability to add

3145
01:46:55,279 --> 01:46:59,198
nutrients into the soil and if you're if

3146
01:46:58,319 --> 01:47:01,679
you're putting it in

3147
01:46:59,198 --> 01:47:03,759
correctly it will not ever get into the

3148
01:47:01,679 --> 01:47:05,600
water below the plant will use it up

3149
01:47:03,760 --> 01:47:07,280
or the soilless medium will hold and

3150
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:09,360
store those nutrients in play

3151
01:47:07,279 --> 01:47:11,118
for the plant to use so if you are going

3152
01:47:09,359 --> 01:47:14,319
to go with aquaponic

3153
01:47:11,118 --> 01:47:17,198
i personally prefer the dual root zone

3154
01:47:14,319 --> 01:47:19,599
as a way to give you the best of both

3155
01:47:17,198 --> 01:47:19,599
worlds

3156
01:47:21,118 --> 01:47:27,198
all right so in conclusion um

3157
01:47:24,639 --> 01:47:27,760
i really want to stress that this is a

3158
01:47:27,198 --> 01:47:30,799
journey

3159
01:47:27,760 --> 01:47:32,560
this is not a race um you really want to

3160
01:47:30,800 --> 01:47:36,480
choose what's comfortable

3161
01:47:32,560 --> 01:47:37,520
um what you feel your your it's in your

3162
01:47:36,479 --> 01:47:39,599
wheelhouse

3163
01:47:37,520 --> 01:47:41,119
i'm not saying don't don't get a little

3164
01:47:39,600 --> 01:47:43,840
you know aggressive in in

3165
01:47:41,118 --> 01:47:44,559
and going for it but you want to make

3166
01:47:43,840 --> 01:47:47,199
sure that you

3167
01:47:44,560 --> 01:47:48,960
you understand the ramifications of the

3168
01:47:47,198 --> 01:47:50,479
decisions you're making

3169
01:47:48,960 --> 01:47:53,039
and make sure those are responsible

3170
01:47:50,479 --> 01:47:55,359
decisions unfortunately i see too much

3171
01:47:53,039 --> 01:47:57,359
uh people jump in and then they get in

3172
01:47:55,359 --> 01:47:58,238
trouble and then they start bad mouthing

3173
01:47:57,359 --> 01:48:00,319
these systems

3174
01:47:58,238 --> 01:48:02,638
these systems work and you know

3175
01:48:00,319 --> 01:48:03,920
yesterday i tagged a bunch of farms

3176
01:48:02,639 --> 01:48:06,000
up in the humble area that have been

3177
01:48:03,920 --> 01:48:08,719
doing this stuff for a long time

3178
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:10,479
and and what they're producing is you

3179
01:48:08,719 --> 01:48:13,359
know amazing stuff

3180
01:48:10,479 --> 01:48:15,039
so they didn't just jump into this they

3181
01:48:13,359 --> 01:48:17,519
slowly moved into this

3182
01:48:15,039 --> 01:48:18,880
as they were comfortable and again make

3183
01:48:17,520 --> 01:48:21,600
small steps

3184
01:48:18,880 --> 01:48:23,520
um you know i experiment experiment

3185
01:48:21,600 --> 01:48:24,960
experiment i think that is the best way

3186
01:48:23,520 --> 01:48:27,119
to learn

3187
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:29,039
and those are small steps so you're

3188
01:48:27,118 --> 01:48:31,118
learning to work with horizontal systems

3189
01:48:29,039 --> 01:48:32,319
you're learning to work with pitmas

3190
01:48:31,118 --> 01:48:34,719
you're learning to work with some of

3191
01:48:32,319 --> 01:48:36,880
these other tools like the orometer

3192
01:48:34,719 --> 01:48:38,560
and lastly and probably most important

3193
01:48:36,880 --> 01:48:41,840
is do your research

3194
01:48:38,560 --> 01:48:43,119
don't just take anyone's word um i i

3195
01:48:41,840 --> 01:48:44,960
the whole reason we started these

3196
01:48:43,118 --> 01:48:46,000
conferences in the first place was

3197
01:48:44,960 --> 01:48:48,079
because of the bro science

3198
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:49,198
flying around and you know i see too

3199
01:48:48,079 --> 01:48:51,679
many people

3200
01:48:49,198 --> 01:48:52,879
listen to oh i know how to fix this and

3201
01:48:51,679 --> 01:48:55,199
do this

3202
01:48:52,880 --> 01:48:57,440
don't say okay cool i thank you for the

3203
01:48:55,198 --> 01:48:59,678
advice and then go do your research

3204
01:48:57,439 --> 01:49:01,359
and chances are you'll find that that

3205
01:48:59,679 --> 01:49:02,319
you know someone else tried it and it

3206
01:49:01,359 --> 01:49:03,839
didn't work

3207
01:49:02,319 --> 01:49:05,359
and you're just preventing yourself from

3208
01:49:03,840 --> 01:49:08,239
making a large mistake

3209
01:49:05,359 --> 01:49:08,639
so the more educated you are the more

3210
01:49:08,238 --> 01:49:10,638
good

3211
01:49:08,639 --> 01:49:12,079
solid decisions that you can make as you

3212
01:49:10,639 --> 01:49:14,719
move into

3213
01:49:12,079 --> 01:49:17,198
these other types of soil and or

3214
01:49:14,719 --> 01:49:19,198
regenerative organic practices

3215
01:49:17,198 --> 01:49:20,799
so that's that's about it here's a way

3216
01:49:19,198 --> 01:49:23,359
to get in touch with me

3217
01:49:20,800 --> 01:49:23,920
um you know i've got email facebook as

3218
01:49:23,359 --> 01:49:26,960
well as

3219
01:49:23,920 --> 01:49:28,079
instagram so that concludes my uh

3220
01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:31,599
presentation for today

3221
01:49:28,079 --> 01:49:33,198
and daniel would you like to hop on yeah

3222
01:49:31,599 --> 01:49:34,639
thanks leighton that was that was

3223
01:49:33,198 --> 01:49:36,479
amazing um

3224
01:49:34,639 --> 01:49:37,920
you blew my mind a couple times there

3225
01:49:36,479 --> 01:49:39,678
and i'm sure

3226
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:41,359
sure you did the same thing for for some

3227
01:49:39,679 --> 01:49:43,520
other people

3228
01:49:41,359 --> 01:49:44,880
so before we get into q a here i just

3229
01:49:43,520 --> 01:49:46,880
wanted to

3230
01:49:44,880 --> 01:49:48,639
take a minute you to talk about our

3231
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:51,359
sponsor for this event

3232
01:49:48,639 --> 01:49:52,960
so um and i want to first start by

3233
01:49:51,359 --> 01:49:54,719
saying that we were actually we were

3234
01:49:52,960 --> 01:49:56,560
very particular about

3235
01:49:54,719 --> 01:49:58,319
what companies we allowed to sponsor

3236
01:49:56,560 --> 01:49:59,599
this event we really wanted companies

3237
01:49:58,319 --> 01:50:01,679
that aligned

3238
01:49:59,599 --> 01:50:02,800
with the education that we're doing here

3239
01:50:01,679 --> 01:50:05,118
that you know have

3240
01:50:02,800 --> 01:50:07,840
really good products that are oriented

3241
01:50:05,118 --> 01:50:09,519
towards growing with living soil

3242
01:50:07,840 --> 01:50:11,119
so we vetted all these sponsors pretty

3243
01:50:09,520 --> 01:50:12,960
carefully um

3244
01:50:11,118 --> 01:50:14,238
so pitt moss is actually our title

3245
01:50:12,960 --> 01:50:16,639
sponsor for the event

3246
01:50:14,238 --> 01:50:18,238
um and again just to emphasize you know

3247
01:50:16,639 --> 01:50:19,440
the re part of the reason they're title

3248
01:50:18,238 --> 01:50:21,678
sponsors because

3249
01:50:19,439 --> 01:50:23,039
we really um think that they've got a

3250
01:50:21,679 --> 01:50:24,158
great product that's why leighton talks

3251
01:50:23,039 --> 01:50:25,359
about it you know it's not because

3252
01:50:24,158 --> 01:50:26,799
they're the sponsor but it's because

3253
01:50:25,359 --> 01:50:28,479
he's actually vetted their product and

3254
01:50:26,800 --> 01:50:31,520
and he believes it's really great

3255
01:50:28,479 --> 01:50:32,479
um and then our sponsor for this session

3256
01:50:31,520 --> 01:50:35,679
in particular

3257
01:50:32,479 --> 01:50:37,439
is green grow mi which is a

3258
01:50:35,679 --> 01:50:40,239
big store online store based out of

3259
01:50:37,439 --> 01:50:40,238
michigan what's up guys

3260
01:50:40,560 --> 01:50:44,880
based on a whole lot of uh great

3261
01:50:42,479 --> 01:50:46,319
products for living soil growing

3262
01:50:44,880 --> 01:50:47,920
so check them out and check out pitt

3263
01:50:46,319 --> 01:50:50,559
moss there

3264
01:50:47,920 --> 01:50:52,800
there are sponsors for the whole event

3265
01:50:50,560 --> 01:50:55,119
and for this session yeah and there are

3266
01:50:52,800 --> 01:50:57,520
there are other paper mulch products out

3267
01:50:55,118 --> 01:50:59,279
there and i have tried them

3268
01:50:57,520 --> 01:51:01,280
but they don't have the quality that

3269
01:50:59,279 --> 01:51:03,519
these guys did remember

3270
01:51:01,279 --> 01:51:04,559
charles bathkey spent three years

3271
01:51:03,520 --> 01:51:07,119
reformulating this

3272
01:51:04,560 --> 01:51:07,920
to make it good and yeah the great go

3273
01:51:07,118 --> 01:51:10,079
great

3274
01:51:07,920 --> 01:51:11,440
great grow guys up in michigan love them

3275
01:51:10,079 --> 01:51:13,359
to death

3276
01:51:11,439 --> 01:51:15,439
sorry we didn't get to see you guys live

3277
01:51:13,359 --> 01:51:19,920
but uh maybe in the future we can

3278
01:51:15,439 --> 01:51:20,638
actually start to get together again

3279
01:51:19,920 --> 01:51:23,279
awesome

3280
01:51:20,639 --> 01:51:24,960
all right so let's get into the the q a

3281
01:51:23,279 --> 01:51:27,118
here

3282
01:51:24,960 --> 01:51:28,800
so we've got a lot of questions and

3283
01:51:27,118 --> 01:51:30,479
hopefully we'll get to

3284
01:51:28,800 --> 01:51:32,400
most of them um but we're gonna start

3285
01:51:30,479 --> 01:51:34,879
with the ones that got the most votes

3286
01:51:32,399 --> 01:51:35,439
so uh greg is asking when building the

3287
01:51:34,880 --> 01:51:38,560
soil

3288
01:51:35,439 --> 01:51:40,638
horizons in an 18 inch deep pot do you

3289
01:51:38,560 --> 01:51:41,280
allow the water to drain out or allow it

3290
01:51:40,639 --> 01:51:45,279
to pool

3291
01:51:41,279 --> 01:51:48,158
in the e horizon so what i do is i

3292
01:51:45,279 --> 01:51:51,118
actually use a

3293
01:51:48,158 --> 01:51:51,598
container water holder so a pot with a

3294
01:51:51,118 --> 01:51:54,479
little

3295
01:51:51,599 --> 01:51:55,760
uh like plate underneath it um when you

3296
01:51:54,479 --> 01:51:57,519
go to your local

3297
01:51:55,760 --> 01:51:59,039
uh garden supply place you'll see

3298
01:51:57,520 --> 01:52:00,880
regular clay pots

3299
01:51:59,039 --> 01:52:02,880
and then you can also get the little

3300
01:52:00,880 --> 01:52:05,359
saucers that go underneath it

3301
01:52:02,880 --> 01:52:08,159
so what i do is i get a saucer that's

3302
01:52:05,359 --> 01:52:10,479
the same height as my e horizon

3303
01:52:08,158 --> 01:52:11,439
and i put the pot in there so that when

3304
01:52:10,479 --> 01:52:14,000
i water it

3305
01:52:11,439 --> 01:52:16,079
i can actually see what the water level

3306
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:18,399
is in my e horizon

3307
01:52:16,079 --> 01:52:20,000
and and it also helps me understand is

3308
01:52:18,399 --> 01:52:21,598
the e dry or not

3309
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:23,520
so it's just a matter of using

3310
01:52:21,599 --> 01:52:25,760
traditional potting methods and

3311
01:52:23,520 --> 01:52:26,800
it can be a plastic tub you know

3312
01:52:25,760 --> 01:52:28,560
whatever size

3313
01:52:26,800 --> 01:52:30,800
you're growing in if you're growing in

3314
01:52:28,560 --> 01:52:33,599
uh you know a 200 gallon

3315
01:52:30,800 --> 01:52:35,360
pot then you can just use a rubber liner

3316
01:52:33,599 --> 01:52:36,400
around the outside and a couple of two

3317
01:52:35,359 --> 01:52:38,880
by fours

3318
01:52:36,399 --> 01:52:41,359
to hold the rubber liner up and so as

3319
01:52:38,880 --> 01:52:43,279
that water gets down into the e horizon

3320
01:52:41,359 --> 01:52:44,960
it leaks out and you can actually see

3321
01:52:43,279 --> 01:52:46,719
the level of water

3322
01:52:44,960 --> 01:52:48,880
so that's that's a trick another way you

3323
01:52:46,719 --> 01:52:51,840
can do is you can actually slide a pipe

3324
01:52:48,880 --> 01:52:52,719
down inside the pot um with a little

3325
01:52:51,840 --> 01:52:54,400
hole at the bottom

3326
01:52:52,719 --> 01:52:56,079
so that the moisture can go in there and

3327
01:52:54,399 --> 01:52:56,638
then you can just use a stick to dip it

3328
01:52:56,079 --> 01:52:58,238
down

3329
01:52:56,639 --> 01:53:00,719
kind of like you see them stabbing gas

3330
01:52:58,238 --> 01:53:03,118
tanks at filling stations

3331
01:53:00,719 --> 01:53:05,039
it's another way to measure if you even

3332
01:53:03,118 --> 01:53:06,079
have moisture in there or what the level

3333
01:53:05,039 --> 01:53:08,639
of moisture is

3334
01:53:06,079 --> 01:53:11,359
and again you don't want to ever have a

3335
01:53:08,639 --> 01:53:14,159
situation where you've watered so much

3336
01:53:11,359 --> 01:53:15,198
that your a horizon is now sitting in in

3337
01:53:14,158 --> 01:53:17,039
excess water

3338
01:53:15,198 --> 01:53:19,359
so that's why it's important to monitor

3339
01:53:17,039 --> 01:53:21,599
that somehow whether it's out externally

3340
01:53:19,359 --> 01:53:23,039
or internally

3341
01:53:21,599 --> 01:53:24,800
great and then that's a perfect segue

3342
01:53:23,039 --> 01:53:26,800
into the next question someone was just

3343
01:53:24,800 --> 01:53:28,159
asking can you use fabric pots like

3344
01:53:26,800 --> 01:53:31,760
grassroots for

3345
01:53:28,158 --> 01:53:34,079
the horizon method oh absolutely uh

3346
01:53:31,760 --> 01:53:36,560
i forget which pot it was shango has

3347
01:53:34,079 --> 01:53:38,559
showcased it lately um

3348
01:53:36,560 --> 01:53:40,400
is it the grassroots pod but it has it

3349
01:53:38,560 --> 01:53:42,320
has a vapor barrier on the inside and

3350
01:53:40,399 --> 01:53:43,598
that was always my biggest issue with

3351
01:53:42,319 --> 01:53:46,000
with the traditional

3352
01:53:43,599 --> 01:53:48,159
fabric pots like the smart pots is

3353
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:50,238
there's no vapor barrier so what happens

3354
01:53:48,158 --> 01:53:51,359
is you're allowing that moisture to wick

3355
01:53:50,238 --> 01:53:53,359
out the sides

3356
01:53:51,359 --> 01:53:55,118
and you're allowing the oxygen to dry

3357
01:53:53,359 --> 01:53:57,279
out the sides and that's where

3358
01:53:55,118 --> 01:53:58,158
those hydrophobic situations come in and

3359
01:53:57,279 --> 01:53:59,920
you pour

3360
01:53:58,158 --> 01:54:01,359
your water on the top of the pot and it

3361
01:53:59,920 --> 01:54:03,039
just runs right down the sides of the

3362
01:54:01,359 --> 01:54:04,319
pot you're not getting any penetration

3363
01:54:03,039 --> 01:54:06,079
whatsoever

3364
01:54:04,319 --> 01:54:08,000
and you know perhaps i should like

3365
01:54:06,079 --> 01:54:10,158
address what hydrophobic actually

3366
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:11,840
is it's where you have a high level of

3367
01:54:10,158 --> 01:54:14,638
bacterial concentration

3368
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:16,560
and and of course their biofilm and when

3369
01:54:14,639 --> 01:54:18,319
they go into a cyst form

3370
01:54:16,560 --> 01:54:20,159
they create like a wax coating around

3371
01:54:18,319 --> 01:54:22,639
the outside of their uh

3372
01:54:20,158 --> 01:54:24,960
their shell and that's what repels the

3373
01:54:22,639 --> 01:54:28,639
water so if you have a highly biological

3374
01:54:24,960 --> 01:54:30,319
system and it it's dried out those those

3375
01:54:28,639 --> 01:54:34,319
bacteria have gone

3376
01:54:30,319 --> 01:54:35,359
into uh cyst form um and now that water

3377
01:54:34,319 --> 01:54:38,880
can't penetrate

3378
01:54:35,359 --> 01:54:39,439
so with these uh the the grass pots or

3379
01:54:38,880 --> 01:54:41,039
whichever

3380
01:54:39,439 --> 01:54:42,719
whichever company it is that has the

3381
01:54:41,039 --> 01:54:44,158
liner on it big

3382
01:54:42,719 --> 01:54:45,920
big fan of it because it's going to

3383
01:54:44,158 --> 01:54:48,399
prevent that from happening to the side

3384
01:54:45,920 --> 01:54:48,399
of the pot

3385
01:54:48,719 --> 01:54:53,679
all right um next question

3386
01:54:51,840 --> 01:54:58,239
do you know what the ideal fungal to

3387
01:54:53,679 --> 01:54:58,239
bacterial ratio is for growing cannabis

3388
01:54:59,520 --> 01:55:02,800
oh man all right there's a lot of work

3389
01:55:01,920 --> 01:55:05,039
being done

3390
01:55:02,800 --> 01:55:06,480
right now and elaine i think i'm hoping

3391
01:55:05,039 --> 01:55:08,800
she's going to touch on this she's been

3392
01:55:06,479 --> 01:55:11,519
doing some work in brazil

3393
01:55:08,800 --> 01:55:13,199
yeah um but bottom line is you have to

3394
01:55:11,520 --> 01:55:16,639
understand successionally

3395
01:55:13,198 --> 01:55:20,158
where the cannabis plant falls in in

3396
01:55:16,639 --> 01:55:22,319
plant succession and yes you have

3397
01:55:20,158 --> 01:55:24,559
you know what we want to call the sativa

3398
01:55:22,319 --> 01:55:26,479
indica yes they they did exist at one

3399
01:55:24,560 --> 01:55:27,760
point they don't anymore we've crossbred

3400
01:55:26,479 --> 01:55:30,319
them so many times

3401
01:55:27,760 --> 01:55:32,000
but one was grown up in the mountains uh

3402
01:55:30,319 --> 01:55:35,599
very dry arid climate

3403
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:37,599
um so probably less f2b there

3404
01:55:35,599 --> 01:55:39,279
than the ones that were grown down in in

3405
01:55:37,599 --> 01:55:42,400
the jungles or in in

3406
01:55:39,279 --> 01:55:45,118
you know the higher more advanced

3407
01:55:42,399 --> 01:55:46,638
complex ecosystems i would tend to think

3408
01:55:45,118 --> 01:55:49,359
would be on the higher f to b

3409
01:55:46,639 --> 01:55:51,039
ratio but i do believe that it would be

3410
01:55:49,359 --> 01:55:54,238
higher than a one to one

3411
01:55:51,039 --> 01:55:56,238
one to one is typical like vegetables uh

3412
01:55:54,238 --> 01:55:57,919
house plants they should be about one

3413
01:55:56,238 --> 01:56:00,959
bacteria to one fungi

3414
01:55:57,920 --> 01:56:02,319
whereas the plan is is uh later in

3415
01:56:00,960 --> 01:56:03,198
succession and therefore should have a

3416
01:56:02,319 --> 01:56:05,279
higher level

3417
01:56:03,198 --> 01:56:08,319
of f to b and hopefully elaine will

3418
01:56:05,279 --> 01:56:09,599
we'll get into that a little bit more

3419
01:56:08,319 --> 01:56:12,238
great and also i just want to make a

3420
01:56:09,599 --> 01:56:14,159
quick note because people are

3421
01:56:12,238 --> 01:56:15,598
still asking about this issue with the

3422
01:56:14,158 --> 01:56:17,439
the pop up

3423
01:56:15,599 --> 01:56:19,279
asking you to continue i believe we

3424
01:56:17,439 --> 01:56:20,000
fixed that now you may need to just

3425
01:56:19,279 --> 01:56:22,399
refresh

3426
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:23,920
your browser um but that that should be

3427
01:56:22,399 --> 01:56:26,479
gone and and hopefully that won't be a

3428
01:56:23,920 --> 01:56:28,800
problem for the sessions going forward

3429
01:56:26,479 --> 01:56:28,799
all right

3430
01:56:30,238 --> 01:56:33,759
was it the pop-up that kept happening to

3431
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:35,840
me

3432
01:56:33,760 --> 01:56:37,520
oh yeah it might be yeah everyone's just

3433
01:56:35,840 --> 01:56:39,039
getting a pop-up asking them to click to

3434
01:56:37,520 --> 01:56:42,000
continue the session

3435
01:56:39,039 --> 01:56:44,560
but oh okay yeah i had that happen to me

3436
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:46,158
did you see it on my screen

3437
01:56:44,560 --> 01:56:47,679
no i didn't but i i think i think i

3438
01:56:46,158 --> 01:56:48,799
figured out how to how to turn that off

3439
01:56:47,679 --> 01:56:50,000
so it shouldn't be a problem going

3440
01:56:48,800 --> 01:56:53,440
forward

3441
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:56,719
yeah okay um so next question is

3442
01:56:53,439 --> 01:56:58,879
would um how would you mix clay into

3443
01:56:56,719 --> 01:57:01,039
your throat

3444
01:56:58,880 --> 01:57:03,118
oh good question um i'm going to answer

3445
01:57:01,039 --> 01:57:05,359
this for both silt and clay

3446
01:57:03,118 --> 01:57:07,839
silt is is usually going to be my are

3447
01:57:05,359 --> 01:57:10,559
harvested out in a wet form

3448
01:57:07,840 --> 01:57:12,079
um and clay is often pretty wet

3449
01:57:10,560 --> 01:57:14,320
saturated as well

3450
01:57:12,079 --> 01:57:15,118
so both of these i would air dry so if

3451
01:57:14,319 --> 01:57:16,719
it was indoor

3452
01:57:15,118 --> 01:57:19,118
i would i would spread them out on a

3453
01:57:16,719 --> 01:57:22,079
tarp with a dehumidifier

3454
01:57:19,118 --> 01:57:23,920
and dry them until they are fluffy you

3455
01:57:22,079 --> 01:57:24,719
cannot homogenously mix them when

3456
01:57:23,920 --> 01:57:28,000
they're wet they

3457
01:57:24,719 --> 01:57:29,679
get clumpy so both your silt

3458
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:31,359
and your clay should be as dry as you

3459
01:57:29,679 --> 01:57:33,679
possibly can get them

3460
01:57:31,359 --> 01:57:34,639
another thing is a trick if you're doing

3461
01:57:33,679 --> 01:57:37,118
this at home

3462
01:57:34,639 --> 01:57:39,279
get a cement mixer not a mortar mixer a

3463
01:57:37,118 --> 01:57:41,198
mortar mixer will not do the right job

3464
01:57:39,279 --> 01:57:42,719
so the difference is a cement mixer is

3465
01:57:41,198 --> 01:57:44,238
going to be in a cone

3466
01:57:42,719 --> 01:57:46,399
and a mortar mixer is going to be more

3467
01:57:44,238 --> 01:57:49,839
in like a bucket

3468
01:57:46,399 --> 01:57:51,679
so get a cement mixer use a

3469
01:57:49,840 --> 01:57:53,599
one gallon bucket whatever to do your

3470
01:57:51,679 --> 01:57:55,520
ratios correctly

3471
01:57:53,599 --> 01:57:57,000
throw it all in there and then turn your

3472
01:57:55,520 --> 01:57:59,840
cement mixer on because it's going to

3473
01:57:57,000 --> 01:58:02,000
homogenizely mix this together

3474
01:57:59,840 --> 01:58:04,000
thoroughly you can't do it you can't do

3475
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:06,479
it with your hands like i've tried

3476
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:08,479
it's just it's too hard and the goal is

3477
01:58:06,479 --> 01:58:11,118
to have that as blended

3478
01:58:08,479 --> 01:58:12,799
as well blended as possible so that it's

3479
01:58:11,118 --> 01:58:15,198
functioning at peak performance right

3480
01:58:12,800 --> 01:58:18,079
out of the gate

3481
01:58:15,198 --> 01:58:19,039
awesome all right um then another

3482
01:58:18,079 --> 01:58:21,279
question about

3483
01:58:19,039 --> 01:58:23,198
kind of along this train when building a

3484
01:58:21,279 --> 01:58:24,319
fresh batch of spoil according to your

3485
01:58:23,198 --> 01:58:26,719
horizon method

3486
01:58:24,319 --> 01:58:27,519
um what total volume would you recommend

3487
01:58:26,719 --> 01:58:30,158
per

3488
01:58:27,520 --> 01:58:31,760
four foot by four foot growing bed so i

3489
01:58:30,158 --> 01:58:32,879
imagine that means total volume of each

3490
01:58:31,760 --> 01:58:35,520
component

3491
01:58:32,880 --> 01:58:36,319
perhaps okay yeah so i would say go back

3492
01:58:35,520 --> 01:58:39,920
to that

3493
01:58:36,319 --> 01:58:42,559
ratio 3o 2a

3494
01:58:39,920 --> 01:58:42,960
1e and and that will give you the the

3495
01:58:42,560 --> 01:58:45,440
height

3496
01:58:42,960 --> 01:58:46,079
version as far as the actual square

3497
01:58:45,439 --> 01:58:47,039
footage

3498
01:58:46,079 --> 01:58:49,279
that's something you're going to have to

3499
01:58:47,039 --> 01:58:51,679
do some calculating on but

3500
01:58:49,279 --> 01:58:52,559
it's not it's not that complicated but i

3501
01:58:51,679 --> 01:58:54,880
think that that

3502
01:58:52,560 --> 01:58:56,480
the depths are way more important than

3503
01:58:54,880 --> 01:58:59,679
than you know the overall

3504
01:58:56,479 --> 01:59:00,959
square footage you need great and just

3505
01:58:59,679 --> 01:59:04,239
want to note to everybody

3506
01:59:00,960 --> 01:59:05,599
um you have access to watch the replay

3507
01:59:04,238 --> 01:59:08,079
of this for 30 days

3508
01:59:05,599 --> 01:59:09,599
so uh if you missed something if you

3509
01:59:08,079 --> 01:59:11,118
want to see that graphic again

3510
01:59:09,599 --> 01:59:12,719
you will be able to go back and replay

3511
01:59:11,118 --> 01:59:14,319
it and reference that

3512
01:59:12,719 --> 01:59:16,000
and you know another thing too is

3513
01:59:14,319 --> 01:59:17,920
shaping fire i did

3514
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:20,479
a wonderful presentation with with

3515
01:59:17,920 --> 01:59:23,359
shango a year or so ago

3516
01:59:20,479 --> 01:59:24,079
there's a 10-minute video clip on his

3517
01:59:23,359 --> 01:59:27,039
youtube

3518
01:59:24,079 --> 01:59:28,719
shaping fire site and then uh we did the

3519
01:59:27,039 --> 01:59:30,079
podcast which was like an hour and a

3520
01:59:28,719 --> 01:59:32,560
half where we really chopped

3521
01:59:30,079 --> 01:59:34,399
it up and so if you want a refresher

3522
01:59:32,560 --> 01:59:35,840
that's a great place or a great resource

3523
01:59:34,399 --> 01:59:39,279
to go back and

3524
01:59:35,840 --> 01:59:41,920
check out awesome

3525
01:59:39,279 --> 01:59:43,920
um there's another question just about

3526
01:59:41,920 --> 01:59:45,440
basically what are what are the ideal

3527
01:59:43,920 --> 01:59:47,118
pots to grow and i mean i

3528
01:59:45,439 --> 01:59:48,000
think you kind of answered that already

3529
01:59:47,118 --> 01:59:50,079
leighton but i don't know if you want to

3530
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:53,920
say anything else about pots

3531
01:59:50,079 --> 01:59:55,920
you know um i like i like raised beds

3532
01:59:53,920 --> 01:59:57,118
more than i like pots i just think that

3533
01:59:55,920 --> 02:00:00,158
you have more

3534
01:59:57,118 --> 02:00:01,118
spaces for diversity i'm a big fan of

3535
02:00:00,158 --> 02:00:02,960
polyculture

3536
02:00:01,118 --> 02:00:05,439
uh joshua steensland's so excited to

3537
02:00:02,960 --> 02:00:08,399
have him on i mean check out his ig

3538
02:00:05,439 --> 02:00:09,839
page of his indoor grow i mean it's it's

3539
02:00:08,399 --> 02:00:11,679
a jungle

3540
02:00:09,840 --> 02:00:13,520
and you know his approach to cover

3541
02:00:11,679 --> 02:00:15,359
cropping was like i threw a bunch of

3542
02:00:13,520 --> 02:00:17,280
stuff in there and saw what worked

3543
02:00:15,359 --> 02:00:19,279
and i think that is that is the correct

3544
02:00:17,279 --> 02:00:21,039
approach i mean i'm a big proponent of

3545
02:00:19,279 --> 02:00:23,519
carrots and potatoes

3546
02:00:21,039 --> 02:00:26,238
uh for a root crop and a big fan of

3547
02:00:23,520 --> 02:00:28,800
these big leafy greens to help create a

3548
02:00:26,238 --> 02:00:30,638
micro climate on the surface of the pot

3549
02:00:28,800 --> 02:00:33,279
so you really can't do that kind of

3550
02:00:30,639 --> 02:00:36,000
diversity in in a regular pot

3551
02:00:33,279 --> 02:00:36,399
so my mind the bigger the pot the better

3552
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:39,039
you know

3553
02:00:36,399 --> 02:00:40,559
get up get a 200 gallon pod and put a

3554
02:00:39,039 --> 02:00:41,599
plant in each quarter

3555
02:00:40,560 --> 02:00:43,599
that way you're going to get a little

3556
02:00:41,599 --> 02:00:46,000
bit more surface area to get

3557
02:00:43,599 --> 02:00:48,639
you diversify your your green mulch or

3558
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:51,198
your cover crop

3559
02:00:48,639 --> 02:00:52,800
so yeah i mean again that the if you're

3560
02:00:51,198 --> 02:00:55,039
going to go with a fabric pot

3561
02:00:52,800 --> 02:00:56,400
make sure that it has that vapor barrier

3562
02:00:55,039 --> 02:00:59,198
so that you do not lose

3563
02:00:56,399 --> 02:00:59,920
uh your moisture out the sides and or

3564
02:00:59,198 --> 02:01:02,158
you're

3565
02:00:59,920 --> 02:01:03,279
you don't have correct gas exchange

3566
02:01:02,158 --> 02:01:06,719
because remember

3567
02:01:03,279 --> 02:01:09,519
the horizons are designed like soil soil

3568
02:01:06,719 --> 02:01:10,639
isn't ever put in a pot in nature it's

3569
02:01:09,520 --> 02:01:13,440
flat it's level

3570
02:01:10,639 --> 02:01:15,199
so there is enough no sides to the soil

3571
02:01:13,439 --> 02:01:17,759
that is getting exposed

3572
02:01:15,198 --> 02:01:18,638
so again that's why you know i'm a i

3573
02:01:17,760 --> 02:01:20,639
like bigger

3574
02:01:18,639 --> 02:01:22,000
sections like these raised beds than i

3575
02:01:20,639 --> 02:01:24,079
do the little pots

3576
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:25,679
because you're preventing that both

3577
02:01:24,079 --> 02:01:30,238
temperature swing

3578
02:01:25,679 --> 02:01:31,599
uh gas exchange uh hydrophobic potential

3579
02:01:30,238 --> 02:01:33,359
so if you're going to go with a fabric

3580
02:01:31,599 --> 02:01:34,639
pot make sure it has the vapor barrier

3581
02:01:33,359 --> 02:01:36,799
and i hope i asked you

3582
02:01:34,639 --> 02:01:38,480
answered your question my friend yeah i

3583
02:01:36,800 --> 02:01:41,360
think that was pretty good

3584
02:01:38,479 --> 02:01:41,839
um do you amend the soil with diatoms or

3585
02:01:41,359 --> 02:01:44,719
do you

3586
02:01:41,840 --> 02:01:47,679
water them in and doesn't this kill off

3587
02:01:44,719 --> 02:01:49,520
good microlife

3588
02:01:47,679 --> 02:01:51,039
great question no you have to water them

3589
02:01:49,520 --> 02:01:53,679
in um

3590
02:01:51,039 --> 02:01:54,800
diatoms are a really cool creature i

3591
02:01:53,679 --> 02:01:57,599
highly recommend you

3592
02:01:54,800 --> 02:01:59,039
you go online go to google and go to

3593
02:01:57,599 --> 02:02:01,840
imagery i mean they're like

3594
02:01:59,039 --> 02:02:03,760
snowflakes they're they're just so many

3595
02:02:01,840 --> 02:02:06,880
different types

3596
02:02:03,760 --> 02:02:09,920
the ones that i harvest from back east

3597
02:02:06,880 --> 02:02:10,560
are are more tubular we've found we

3598
02:02:09,920 --> 02:02:13,279
found them

3599
02:02:10,560 --> 02:02:14,639
actually in in the water column and then

3600
02:02:13,279 --> 02:02:17,359
i started having

3601
02:02:14,639 --> 02:02:18,000
keith collect me the solids off of his

3602
02:02:17,359 --> 02:02:20,559
rotary drum

3603
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:22,639
screens and we put those in a stainless

3604
02:02:20,560 --> 02:02:26,000
steel tank with no light

3605
02:02:22,639 --> 02:02:27,118
um i did have him add oxygen or an air

3606
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:29,279
stone

3607
02:02:27,118 --> 02:02:31,118
but no there's no light in it and then

3608
02:02:29,279 --> 02:02:33,920
when i went back to harvest it

3609
02:02:31,118 --> 02:02:35,118
uh you know like a few weeks later i was

3610
02:02:33,920 --> 02:02:37,118
amazed at

3611
02:02:35,118 --> 02:02:38,559
the fact that they they were they were

3612
02:02:37,118 --> 02:02:39,439
breeding they were splitting they were

3613
02:02:38,560 --> 02:02:41,599
dividing

3614
02:02:39,439 --> 02:02:43,439
in a tank with no light and that's when

3615
02:02:41,599 --> 02:02:44,800
i really kind of made me start thinking

3616
02:02:43,439 --> 02:02:47,039
about

3617
02:02:44,800 --> 02:02:48,880
what is their energy source are they're

3618
02:02:47,039 --> 02:02:51,519
so they're obviously not

3619
02:02:48,880 --> 02:02:52,800
living off of the sun they're living off

3620
02:02:51,520 --> 02:02:55,119
something else

3621
02:02:52,800 --> 02:02:56,000
um and we know they're producing oxygen

3622
02:02:55,118 --> 02:02:57,439
um so

3623
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:59,840
they're they're a really interesting

3624
02:02:57,439 --> 02:03:03,279
creature but uh we're gonna

3625
02:02:59,840 --> 02:03:05,840
deep dive into that in january uh

3626
02:03:03,279 --> 02:03:07,599
mid-january and by then we'll have all

3627
02:03:05,840 --> 02:03:10,239
the kinks run out of the

3628
02:03:07,599 --> 02:03:12,960
product production system back east and

3629
02:03:10,238 --> 02:03:15,039
these will be available on the market

3630
02:03:12,960 --> 02:03:16,639
and those those you'll be actually be

3631
02:03:15,039 --> 02:03:18,800
able to have an amo

3632
02:03:16,639 --> 02:03:20,079
aquatic microorganisms that are complete

3633
02:03:18,800 --> 02:03:22,239
diatoms

3634
02:03:20,079 --> 02:03:24,000
nitrifying bacteria phosphate

3635
02:03:22,238 --> 02:03:26,319
solubilizing bacteria

3636
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:27,679
and all these are what's called in vivo

3637
02:03:26,319 --> 02:03:30,319
so they're grown in nature

3638
02:03:27,679 --> 02:03:32,239
not in vitro the problem with growing in

3639
02:03:30,319 --> 02:03:33,679
a lab is yours you have basically

3640
02:03:32,238 --> 02:03:35,439
spoiled children

3641
02:03:33,679 --> 02:03:36,800
they've had the perfect environment

3642
02:03:35,439 --> 02:03:39,839
perfect foods

3643
02:03:36,800 --> 02:03:41,199
no no competition no no hassle

3644
02:03:39,840 --> 02:03:43,119
and now you take them and throw them

3645
02:03:41,198 --> 02:03:44,879
into an existing hostile system where

3646
02:03:43,118 --> 02:03:47,198
everything had to learn to live

3647
02:03:44,880 --> 02:03:48,639
in this hostile environment there's

3648
02:03:47,198 --> 02:03:50,238
their biostimulant

3649
02:03:48,639 --> 02:03:52,000
they're not going to last long so that's

3650
02:03:50,238 --> 02:03:53,799
why it's really important that

3651
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:55,198
when you start talking about using

3652
02:03:53,800 --> 02:03:57,840
microorganisms

3653
02:03:55,198 --> 02:03:59,439
like chris trump natural farming imo

3654
02:03:57,840 --> 02:04:01,679
it's all about imo

3655
02:03:59,439 --> 02:04:02,879
and so the same thing is true that i'm

3656
02:04:01,679 --> 02:04:06,078
i'm working with

3657
02:04:02,880 --> 02:04:07,920
amo that's being harvested in vivo

3658
02:04:06,078 --> 02:04:12,719
in nature so that they are going to

3659
02:04:07,920 --> 02:04:12,719
function and survive in your soil system

3660
02:04:12,800 --> 02:04:16,880
all right is it possible to plus or

3661
02:04:15,920 --> 02:04:20,158
minus charge

3662
02:04:16,880 --> 02:04:22,078
different soil layers to hold nutrients

3663
02:04:20,158 --> 02:04:24,158
well that's the that's the those are the

3664
02:04:22,078 --> 02:04:25,920
micro and macro aggregates

3665
02:04:24,158 --> 02:04:27,839
so the beauty of these aggregation

3666
02:04:25,920 --> 02:04:30,560
processes are that

3667
02:04:27,840 --> 02:04:32,400
and we really don't know which one is

3668
02:04:30,560 --> 02:04:34,079
which whether the center is negatively

3669
02:04:32,399 --> 02:04:34,638
charged and the outside is positively

3670
02:04:34,078 --> 02:04:36,639
charged

3671
02:04:34,639 --> 02:04:38,078
my gut feeling is that that's going to

3672
02:04:36,639 --> 02:04:40,319
be based on what's in

3673
02:04:38,078 --> 02:04:41,840
that macro aggregate like how what is

3674
02:04:40,319 --> 02:04:44,078
the content of clay

3675
02:04:41,840 --> 02:04:46,319
if there's high silt then chances are

3676
02:04:44,078 --> 02:04:48,238
it's going to be more negatively charged

3677
02:04:46,319 --> 02:04:50,960
where if it's high organic matter it's

3678
02:04:48,238 --> 02:04:53,118
going to be both positive and negative

3679
02:04:50,960 --> 02:04:54,078
so there's that's a that's a complex

3680
02:04:53,118 --> 02:04:56,960
question

3681
02:04:54,078 --> 02:04:58,399
um that i can't specifically answer but

3682
02:04:56,960 --> 02:05:00,399
what i can tell you

3683
02:04:58,399 --> 02:05:02,319
is if you have aggregation you have

3684
02:05:00,399 --> 02:05:03,279
great gas exchange you have great water

3685
02:05:02,319 --> 02:05:05,519
infiltration

3686
02:05:03,279 --> 02:05:07,599
you have great nutrient storing capacity

3687
02:05:05,520 --> 02:05:08,320
and you have a beautiful system that the

3688
02:05:07,599 --> 02:05:10,800
roots

3689
02:05:08,319 --> 02:05:12,639
can thrive in uh and push in all

3690
02:05:10,800 --> 02:05:15,039
directions and and do

3691
02:05:12,639 --> 02:05:18,880
mine those those goodies right out of it

3692
02:05:15,039 --> 02:05:18,880
so aggregation is the key to everything

3693
02:05:18,960 --> 02:05:22,719
all right if you're composting in the

3694
02:05:21,118 --> 02:05:24,158
midwest or the northeast

3695
02:05:22,719 --> 02:05:25,439
do you have any recommendations for

3696
02:05:24,158 --> 02:05:27,519
getting through the winters when

3697
02:05:25,439 --> 02:05:30,238
temperatures are below zero

3698
02:05:27,520 --> 02:05:31,599
so again i would be going with a hugel

3699
02:05:30,238 --> 02:05:33,839
culture system there

3700
02:05:31,599 --> 02:05:35,440
so what i used to do when i was in

3701
02:05:33,840 --> 02:05:37,599
connecticut was i would build one in

3702
02:05:35,439 --> 02:05:39,279
spring and one in fall

3703
02:05:37,599 --> 02:05:40,719
the reason i built the one in spring is

3704
02:05:39,279 --> 02:05:42,800
because

3705
02:05:40,719 --> 02:05:44,399
i didn't want to have to worry about

3706
02:05:42,800 --> 02:05:46,960
moisture in the summer

3707
02:05:44,399 --> 02:05:48,078
and so by building it in spring by the

3708
02:05:46,960 --> 02:05:50,158
time summer came

3709
02:05:48,078 --> 02:05:52,158
the whole top of the pile was green it

3710
02:05:50,158 --> 02:05:53,439
was grown in so it was protected by its

3711
02:05:52,158 --> 02:05:55,359
own microclimate

3712
02:05:53,439 --> 02:05:56,559
so those leaves protect the sun from

3713
02:05:55,359 --> 02:05:59,839
drying it out

3714
02:05:56,560 --> 02:06:02,320
uh the miles of roots that were were

3715
02:05:59,840 --> 02:06:04,800
growing off of those cover crops or the

3716
02:06:02,319 --> 02:06:07,519
little shrubs and trees i planted on it

3717
02:06:04,800 --> 02:06:08,239
provided that extra aggregation to store

3718
02:06:07,520 --> 02:06:09,360
moisture

3719
02:06:08,238 --> 02:06:11,678
so i didn't have to worry about it

3720
02:06:09,359 --> 02:06:12,799
drying out and the opposite is true in

3721
02:06:11,679 --> 02:06:14,399
the winter

3722
02:06:12,800 --> 02:06:16,560
i build it in the fall i get it going i

3723
02:06:14,399 --> 02:06:18,960
get it cover cropped snow comes in

3724
02:06:16,560 --> 02:06:20,800
insulates the whole thing and then comes

3725
02:06:18,960 --> 02:06:22,639
spring the snow melts off all the plants

3726
02:06:20,800 --> 02:06:25,840
pop back up and take over

3727
02:06:22,639 --> 02:06:27,440
so build in spring and fall and not in

3728
02:06:25,840 --> 02:06:28,960
don't obviously don't try to build it in

3729
02:06:27,439 --> 02:06:29,519
the winter and if you build in the

3730
02:06:28,960 --> 02:06:30,800
summer

3731
02:06:29,520 --> 02:06:31,760
you're going to have drying out issues

3732
02:06:30,800 --> 02:06:32,719
you're going to you're not going to be

3733
02:06:31,760 --> 02:06:34,320
able to get that

3734
02:06:32,719 --> 02:06:38,000
plants the cover crops that are so

3735
02:06:34,319 --> 02:06:38,000
critical to establish themselves

3736
02:06:39,039 --> 02:06:43,519
all right when you're using wood wood

3737
02:06:42,078 --> 02:06:46,158
chips or straw

3738
02:06:43,520 --> 02:06:47,920
etc as a mulch do you move the mulch to

3739
02:06:46,158 --> 02:06:50,158
expose bare soil surface

3740
02:06:47,920 --> 02:06:51,760
when top dressing or just top dress on

3741
02:06:50,158 --> 02:06:53,598
top of the mulch

3742
02:06:51,760 --> 02:06:55,520
um i would tend to i would tend to pull

3743
02:06:53,599 --> 02:06:57,119
the mulch back depending on what it is a

3744
02:06:55,520 --> 02:06:59,679
lot of guys will use

3745
02:06:57,118 --> 02:07:01,679
like a heavy chip to keep the fungus

3746
02:06:59,679 --> 02:07:04,399
gnats down which is a great trick

3747
02:07:01,679 --> 02:07:05,679
so if you if you were using chips as a

3748
02:07:04,399 --> 02:07:09,679
method to

3749
02:07:05,679 --> 02:07:12,078
uh prevent um inappropriate

3750
02:07:09,679 --> 02:07:13,039
dehydration of the surface of the soil

3751
02:07:12,078 --> 02:07:15,359
or to

3752
02:07:13,039 --> 02:07:16,158
mitigate like a you know fungus gnat

3753
02:07:15,359 --> 02:07:18,479
then i would just

3754
02:07:16,158 --> 02:07:19,920
gently push it back now if it's just a

3755
02:07:18,479 --> 02:07:21,678
thin layer of hay

3756
02:07:19,920 --> 02:07:23,599
um i would just top dress over it

3757
02:07:21,679 --> 02:07:26,960
because that hey as i

3758
02:07:23,599 --> 02:07:27,760
said was was a great um long-term

3759
02:07:26,960 --> 02:07:30,800
storage

3760
02:07:27,760 --> 02:07:32,400
for uh nutrient and so you know again

3761
02:07:30,800 --> 02:07:34,960
the hay is gonna soak up

3762
02:07:32,399 --> 02:07:36,799
uh the top dress if it's liquid uh if

3763
02:07:34,960 --> 02:07:38,399
it's a solid it's not gonna prevent it

3764
02:07:36,800 --> 02:07:41,360
from getting down there unless

3765
02:07:38,399 --> 02:07:42,399
it's a super heavy uh hay so in that

3766
02:07:41,359 --> 02:07:43,920
case if you got

3767
02:07:42,399 --> 02:07:46,000
you know like an inch or two a hay then

3768
02:07:43,920 --> 02:07:47,760
yeah just kind of scratch back the

3769
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:49,679
surface but the the hay

3770
02:07:47,760 --> 02:07:52,079
on the bottom that's coming contact with

3771
02:07:49,679 --> 02:07:53,599
soil don't disturb that because

3772
02:07:52,078 --> 02:07:55,439
you're already going to have fungal

3773
02:07:53,599 --> 02:07:56,400
networks going into that

3774
02:07:55,439 --> 02:07:59,359
you're going to have all kinds of

3775
02:07:56,399 --> 02:08:00,879
protozoa mining it or bacteria mining it

3776
02:07:59,359 --> 02:08:02,960
and of course the protozoa living off

3777
02:08:00,880 --> 02:08:03,599
the bacteria so you don't you don't ever

3778
02:08:02,960 --> 02:08:05,760
want to

3779
02:08:03,599 --> 02:08:06,719
really disturb your soil if at all

3780
02:08:05,760 --> 02:08:08,320
possible

3781
02:08:06,719 --> 02:08:10,000
so again i would just carefully peel it

3782
02:08:08,319 --> 02:08:12,719
back if it's really deep top dress it

3783
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:15,920
then cover it back up again

3784
02:08:12,719 --> 02:08:16,909
hey that's a great answer laden sorry i

3785
02:08:15,920 --> 02:08:19,599
couldn't i couldn't help it

3786
02:08:16,909 --> 02:08:21,920
[Laughter]

3787
02:08:19,599 --> 02:08:22,719
all right next question i live in a

3788
02:08:21,920 --> 02:08:25,118
desert

3789
02:08:22,719 --> 02:08:27,118
um what can i do to have better finished

3790
02:08:25,118 --> 02:08:29,759
product growing in desert sand

3791
02:08:27,118 --> 02:08:31,679
oh yeah that's i was just down in new

3792
02:08:29,760 --> 02:08:35,440
mexico boy

3793
02:08:31,679 --> 02:08:36,480
all right so you got like four percent

3794
02:08:35,439 --> 02:08:39,678
humidity

3795
02:08:36,479 --> 02:08:42,319
in the air that's insane um

3796
02:08:39,679 --> 02:08:43,279
your high altitude so your uvs are super

3797
02:08:42,319 --> 02:08:47,039
hot

3798
02:08:43,279 --> 02:08:50,078
um you know that in before the great

3799
02:08:47,039 --> 02:08:52,800
human expansion um

3800
02:08:50,078 --> 02:08:54,238
the the prairie grass down there was

3801
02:08:52,800 --> 02:08:56,079
like eight feet tall

3802
02:08:54,238 --> 02:08:58,399
i mean there's pictures of guys riding a

3803
02:08:56,078 --> 02:08:59,759
horse because they had to ride a horse

3804
02:08:58,399 --> 02:09:01,679
you couldn't walk through this stuff you

3805
02:08:59,760 --> 02:09:04,239
couldn't see where you were going

3806
02:09:01,679 --> 02:09:05,520
and so the back then the soil was

3807
02:09:04,238 --> 02:09:07,359
amazingly fertile

3808
02:09:05,520 --> 02:09:08,639
and those roots were down you know 20

3809
02:09:07,359 --> 02:09:10,880
feet but then we

3810
02:09:08,639 --> 02:09:13,118
we chopped all the the prairie grass

3811
02:09:10,880 --> 02:09:15,760
down and started growing crops

3812
02:09:13,118 --> 02:09:16,158
and that caused deserts desertification

3813
02:09:15,760 --> 02:09:18,480
so

3814
02:09:16,158 --> 02:09:20,238
now you're in a situation where yeah

3815
02:09:18,479 --> 02:09:21,118
you've you've lost all your organic

3816
02:09:20,238 --> 02:09:23,118
matter

3817
02:09:21,118 --> 02:09:25,118
you've lost your clays all that's blown

3818
02:09:23,118 --> 02:09:28,319
away like i was talking about

3819
02:09:25,118 --> 02:09:31,198
soils are formed through transpiration

3820
02:09:28,319 --> 02:09:33,359
strength transportation so now you've

3821
02:09:31,198 --> 02:09:35,678
got to transport that stuff back in

3822
02:09:33,359 --> 02:09:37,598
so bottom line is you're going to do the

3823
02:09:35,679 --> 02:09:40,480
same thing that i did here

3824
02:09:37,599 --> 02:09:42,800
in oxnard i basically had a sandbox

3825
02:09:40,479 --> 02:09:45,439
literally that's all it was with sand

3826
02:09:42,800 --> 02:09:47,599
and so what i did was i harvested uh i

3827
02:09:45,439 --> 02:09:49,359
wild crafted some local chips

3828
02:09:47,599 --> 02:09:51,119
from a safe place that i knew was not

3829
02:09:49,359 --> 02:09:52,719
going to have a bunch of toxins or

3830
02:09:51,118 --> 02:09:55,598
hydrocarbons in them

3831
02:09:52,719 --> 02:09:56,639
and so the first thing i did was i uh i

3832
02:09:55,599 --> 02:09:58,960
busted up the

3833
02:09:56,639 --> 02:10:00,319
the clay or the sand i loosened it up

3834
02:09:58,960 --> 02:10:01,279
because it was kind of like crusty on

3835
02:10:00,319 --> 02:10:03,439
the top

3836
02:10:01,279 --> 02:10:05,359
um and then i roto tilled in a whole

3837
02:10:03,439 --> 02:10:06,799
bunch of chips like i put three or four

3838
02:10:05,359 --> 02:10:09,118
inches on top of it

3839
02:10:06,800 --> 02:10:10,719
rototilled those in then i broad forked

3840
02:10:09,118 --> 02:10:12,399
them in so because you want to try to

3841
02:10:10,719 --> 02:10:14,800
work them really down in

3842
02:10:12,399 --> 02:10:16,399
you know 12 18 inches down into that

3843
02:10:14,800 --> 02:10:19,119
soil profile

3844
02:10:16,399 --> 02:10:21,279
and then i came back with a yard of

3845
02:10:19,118 --> 02:10:22,158
compost so now i added another couple

3846
02:10:21,279 --> 02:10:24,719
inches

3847
02:10:22,158 --> 02:10:25,519
of top dress and again i rototilled it

3848
02:10:24,719 --> 02:10:28,319
in first

3849
02:10:25,520 --> 02:10:30,400
and then broad forked it and then i then

3850
02:10:28,319 --> 02:10:32,799
i watered it with a nice compost tea

3851
02:10:30,399 --> 02:10:35,439
which in in my case was more of a humic

3852
02:10:32,800 --> 02:10:38,719
acid extract with biology

3853
02:10:35,439 --> 02:10:38,960
um let it let it set up or sprayed that

3854
02:10:38,719 --> 02:10:41,118
in

3855
02:10:38,960 --> 02:10:43,198
watered in a little bit cover cropped it

3856
02:10:41,118 --> 02:10:45,039
and bam i had wonderful soil

3857
02:10:43,198 --> 02:10:46,319
now you're in a desert so you're

3858
02:10:45,039 --> 02:10:47,679
probably going to have a different

3859
02:10:46,319 --> 02:10:49,359
humidity so it's going to be a little

3860
02:10:47,679 --> 02:10:50,719
bit harder for you to do that

3861
02:10:49,359 --> 02:10:52,960
but that's the way you're going to

3862
02:10:50,719 --> 02:10:54,880
establish your soil and then once you

3863
02:10:52,960 --> 02:10:57,198
get something rooting in there

3864
02:10:54,880 --> 02:10:59,199
do never let it get bare dude just

3865
02:10:57,198 --> 02:11:00,719
whatever you do you've got to have those

3866
02:10:59,198 --> 02:11:01,839
cover crops and you're going to have to

3867
02:11:00,719 --> 02:11:04,560
cover crop

3868
02:11:01,840 --> 02:11:06,239
specifically to your area and again what

3869
02:11:04,560 --> 02:11:09,280
those cover crops are doing is they're

3870
02:11:06,238 --> 02:11:12,319
shielding that soil surface from the uvs

3871
02:11:09,279 --> 02:11:14,479
they're shielding it from evaporation

3872
02:11:12,319 --> 02:11:16,238
and they're creating a microclimate

3873
02:11:14,479 --> 02:11:18,479
right on the surface of that soil so

3874
02:11:16,238 --> 02:11:20,479
that you can get that biology to take

3875
02:11:18,479 --> 02:11:22,078
and the roots will get down into it down

3876
02:11:20,479 --> 02:11:24,399
into the deeper parts of the sand

3877
02:11:22,078 --> 02:11:24,799
they'll start to be able to mine um the

3878
02:11:24,399 --> 02:11:26,799
little

3879
02:11:24,800 --> 02:11:28,079
water vapor that's down in there because

3880
02:11:26,800 --> 02:11:30,320
it's there

3881
02:11:28,078 --> 02:11:31,679
um but that's that's the key to to

3882
02:11:30,319 --> 02:11:34,078
taking a desert back

3883
02:11:31,679 --> 02:11:36,639
is just whatever you do never let it get

3884
02:11:34,078 --> 02:11:38,479
bare again

3885
02:11:36,639 --> 02:11:40,480
all right and then uh there's a question

3886
02:11:38,479 --> 02:11:43,198
that just says masonry sand

3887
02:11:40,479 --> 02:11:43,678
question mark uh uh good one yep masonry

3888
02:11:43,198 --> 02:11:47,039
sand

3889
02:11:43,679 --> 02:11:50,639
um masonry sand tends to be

3890
02:11:47,039 --> 02:11:54,158
a little bit more uh

3891
02:11:50,639 --> 02:11:56,000
not as not as coarse as i want it i like

3892
02:11:54,158 --> 02:11:57,359
masonry sand more often than not

3893
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:58,319
depending on which supplier you're

3894
02:11:57,359 --> 02:12:00,639
working

3895
02:11:58,319 --> 02:12:01,679
uh with will be close to what i'm

3896
02:12:00,639 --> 02:12:04,800
talking about

3897
02:12:01,679 --> 02:12:06,480
um i personally like to get sand

3898
02:12:04,800 --> 02:12:08,239
wild crafted because you're going to get

3899
02:12:06,479 --> 02:12:11,598
a bunch of biology with it

3900
02:12:08,238 --> 02:12:14,638
so the biology that mines sand is a very

3901
02:12:11,599 --> 02:12:16,960
specific type of bacteria whereas if

3902
02:12:14,639 --> 02:12:19,279
you're buying the sand from a yard

3903
02:12:16,960 --> 02:12:20,560
that's been washed and processed so

3904
02:12:19,279 --> 02:12:22,960
you've lost

3905
02:12:20,560 --> 02:12:23,599
all the life that's on it so if you're

3906
02:12:22,960 --> 02:12:27,439
trying to

3907
02:12:23,599 --> 02:12:30,239
establish you know uh a soil system now

3908
02:12:27,439 --> 02:12:32,000
again if this is scale that's different

3909
02:12:30,238 --> 02:12:33,598
but if this is small scale no then i

3910
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:34,719
would recommend that you harvest the

3911
02:12:33,599 --> 02:12:36,560
sand

3912
02:12:34,719 --> 02:12:38,560
ideally if you're near an ocean where

3913
02:12:36,560 --> 02:12:40,560
river meets the ocean is a great place

3914
02:12:38,560 --> 02:12:42,320
because you're going to get all kinds of

3915
02:12:40,560 --> 02:12:43,280
diverse biology you'll get and you'll

3916
02:12:42,319 --> 02:12:45,279
get some calls

3917
02:12:43,279 --> 02:12:46,719
calcium carbonate sand as well as some

3918
02:12:45,279 --> 02:12:49,920
silica sand

3919
02:12:46,719 --> 02:12:52,158
if you can't then then go to your go to

3920
02:12:49,920 --> 02:12:54,000
your river or your stream or your lake

3921
02:12:52,158 --> 02:12:55,920
and find uh you know a natural sand

3922
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:56,880
pocket and again you're looking for

3923
02:12:55,920 --> 02:13:00,239
taupe

3924
02:12:56,880 --> 02:13:02,400
yellow you know slightly orange

3925
02:13:00,238 --> 02:13:03,678
those kind of colors will indicate good

3926
02:13:02,399 --> 02:13:06,158
mineral content

3927
02:13:03,679 --> 02:13:07,760
and stay away from the white sand now if

3928
02:13:06,158 --> 02:13:08,799
you're trying to do a big commercial

3929
02:13:07,760 --> 02:13:10,719
grow

3930
02:13:08,800 --> 02:13:12,159
dude get me involved because there's so

3931
02:13:10,719 --> 02:13:13,920
much bad shit that can happen

3932
02:13:12,158 --> 02:13:15,598
i mean i've been working for years with

3933
02:13:13,920 --> 02:13:17,359
different blending companies

3934
02:13:15,599 --> 02:13:19,440
i know the ins and outs i speak their

3935
02:13:17,359 --> 02:13:21,519
language i know how to

3936
02:13:19,439 --> 02:13:23,839
find the sources that that i'm looking

3937
02:13:21,520 --> 02:13:26,079
for and then have them brought into the

3938
02:13:23,840 --> 02:13:28,078
blender and then have it blend

3939
02:13:26,078 --> 02:13:29,759
blend it up but if you if you just walk

3940
02:13:28,078 --> 02:13:31,118
in and say oh i'm doing a cannabis grow

3941
02:13:29,760 --> 02:13:32,159
i need this

3942
02:13:31,118 --> 02:13:33,839
first of all they're going to rape you

3943
02:13:32,158 --> 02:13:35,279
and charge you three times as much and

3944
02:13:33,840 --> 02:13:36,560
second of all you're not going to get

3945
02:13:35,279 --> 02:13:39,279
the ingredients that i'm trying to

3946
02:13:36,560 --> 02:13:39,280
recommend to you

3947
02:13:39,840 --> 02:13:45,599
all right another question about sand

3948
02:13:42,960 --> 02:13:47,439
um sand made from wind is more rounded

3949
02:13:45,599 --> 02:13:49,760
than water formed sand does this make a

3950
02:13:47,439 --> 02:13:51,519
difference when creating a soil

3951
02:13:49,760 --> 02:13:53,039
well that's a that's a great question i

3952
02:13:51,520 --> 02:13:55,679
mean

3953
02:13:53,039 --> 02:13:57,198
i would say like have you ever been uh

3954
02:13:55,679 --> 02:13:59,679
on a really windy day

3955
02:13:57,198 --> 02:14:01,359
down at the beach and and you would see

3956
02:13:59,679 --> 02:14:03,440
the difference you would see that white

3957
02:14:01,359 --> 02:14:05,839
fluffy stuff that's really soft

3958
02:14:03,439 --> 02:14:06,638
that i was warning you to stay away from

3959
02:14:05,840 --> 02:14:08,880
and then you'd see

3960
02:14:06,639 --> 02:14:11,118
pockets of this coarser stuff that's got

3961
02:14:08,880 --> 02:14:14,639
that yellowy tanny color to it

3962
02:14:11,118 --> 02:14:16,639
so again you're to find these sources of

3963
02:14:14,639 --> 02:14:19,599
sand you have to pay attention

3964
02:14:16,639 --> 02:14:21,599
to nature and as far as the actual shape

3965
02:14:19,599 --> 02:14:24,960
of the sand it's less important

3966
02:14:21,599 --> 02:14:26,719
than than whether it's soft and fluffy

3967
02:14:24,960 --> 02:14:28,880
or whether it's coarse and a little bit

3968
02:14:26,719 --> 02:14:30,639
more jagged but yeah i would tend to

3969
02:14:28,880 --> 02:14:32,000
think that with wind

3970
02:14:30,639 --> 02:14:34,078
you know you're going to be knocking the

3971
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:37,118
corners off and and rounding it

3972
02:14:34,078 --> 02:14:38,559
and again with with a softer sand

3973
02:14:37,118 --> 02:14:40,719
now you're getting this tiny little

3974
02:14:38,560 --> 02:14:41,679
sphere that's going to plug up those

3975
02:14:40,719 --> 02:14:43,520
pores

3976
02:14:41,679 --> 02:14:45,118
which we're trying to avoid so you're

3977
02:14:43,520 --> 02:14:45,920
really looking for that coarse sand that

3978
02:14:45,118 --> 02:14:48,639
isn't as

3979
02:14:45,920 --> 02:14:55,840
mobile in the wind that the light fluffy

3980
02:14:48,639 --> 02:14:55,840
stuff is

3981
02:15:02,158 --> 02:15:11,920
dude you're muted

3982
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:14,479
my bad okay so

3983
02:15:11,920 --> 02:15:16,239
question was um can you put somebody

3984
02:15:14,479 --> 02:15:20,399
that asks can you put a millimeter

3985
02:15:16,238 --> 02:15:22,479
size on that um sand particle size

3986
02:15:20,399 --> 02:15:24,559
okay so i think what you're saying is is

3987
02:15:22,479 --> 02:15:27,678
a micro mesh

3988
02:15:24,560 --> 02:15:30,719
micro mesh micron scales um

3989
02:15:27,679 --> 02:15:32,078
those are unit of measurement that soil

3990
02:15:30,719 --> 02:15:35,439
scientists use to

3991
02:15:32,078 --> 02:15:37,039
define particulate size so i would say

3992
02:15:35,439 --> 02:15:40,158
that you're looking at

3993
02:15:37,039 --> 02:15:44,000
somewhere around 200 micron

3994
02:15:40,158 --> 02:15:46,238
so somewhere between 150 and 250 micron

3995
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:49,760
would probably be appropriate

3996
02:15:46,238 --> 02:15:50,718
and if you google mesh micro mesh to

3997
02:15:49,760 --> 02:15:53,520
micron

3998
02:15:50,719 --> 02:15:54,319
scale that would give you that uh

3999
02:15:53,520 --> 02:15:56,560
calculation

4000
02:15:54,319 --> 02:15:57,840
back to what you will purchase for

4001
02:15:56,560 --> 02:16:00,320
screens

4002
02:15:57,840 --> 02:16:03,119
but best way to do it is is to learn

4003
02:16:00,319 --> 02:16:05,279
about sands is go to a masonry yard

4004
02:16:03,118 --> 02:16:07,439
and go feel them just pick them up and

4005
02:16:05,279 --> 02:16:09,039
run run them between your fingers

4006
02:16:07,439 --> 02:16:10,960
and you'll you'll tend to see where i'm

4007
02:16:09,039 --> 02:16:12,560
trying to go with it i don't want a

4008
02:16:10,960 --> 02:16:13,760
super coarse sand but i don't want a

4009
02:16:12,560 --> 02:16:15,280
super fine sand

4010
02:16:13,760 --> 02:16:17,199
somewhere in the middle and again look

4011
02:16:15,279 --> 02:16:18,319
for those colors those colors will indic

4012
02:16:17,198 --> 02:16:20,319
they will steer you in the right

4013
02:16:18,319 --> 02:16:21,759
direction all right

4014
02:16:20,319 --> 02:16:23,359
and i'm just trying to just trying to

4015
02:16:21,760 --> 02:16:25,119
hit off all the stand questions here

4016
02:16:23,359 --> 02:16:27,519
um someone else should i wild craft my

4017
02:16:25,118 --> 02:16:29,439
stand from the beach if i can

4018
02:16:27,520 --> 02:16:31,199
again where i would go is where the

4019
02:16:29,439 --> 02:16:33,439
rivers meet the ocean

4020
02:16:31,198 --> 02:16:35,679
because you're going to get both the the

4021
02:16:33,439 --> 02:16:37,920
transported sand the silica sand

4022
02:16:35,679 --> 02:16:38,719
as well as the calcium carbonate sand

4023
02:16:37,920 --> 02:16:41,840
and again i'm

4024
02:16:38,718 --> 02:16:44,159
all about uh you know diversity the more

4025
02:16:41,840 --> 02:16:46,000
diverse you can get the better you are

4026
02:16:44,159 --> 02:16:48,079
and the other side of that coin is that

4027
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:48,799
that sand is going to be biologically

4028
02:16:48,079 --> 02:16:50,478
active

4029
02:16:48,799 --> 02:16:52,478
you're already going to have the

4030
02:16:50,478 --> 02:16:55,279
specific bacteria

4031
02:16:52,478 --> 02:16:55,679
colonized on that sand that is mining

4032
02:16:55,280 --> 02:16:57,840
and

4033
02:16:55,679 --> 02:16:59,599
how better to get you know that kind of

4034
02:16:57,840 --> 02:17:02,000
benefit into your soil system

4035
02:16:59,599 --> 02:17:04,079
is already having having the specific

4036
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:06,959
type of bacteria that can mine it

4037
02:17:04,079 --> 02:17:06,959
present on it

4038
02:17:07,439 --> 02:17:12,000
all right um how many how many

4039
02:17:10,478 --> 02:17:14,879
milliliters of humic

4040
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:15,679
and fulvic acid per liter or per gallon

4041
02:17:14,879 --> 02:17:19,039
should i use

4042
02:17:15,679 --> 02:17:21,840
for soil applications so

4043
02:17:19,040 --> 02:17:23,679
uh that's a different difficult question

4044
02:17:21,840 --> 02:17:26,398
because it really depends on what you're

4045
02:17:23,679 --> 02:17:28,719
trying to accomplish if you're sand

4046
02:17:26,398 --> 02:17:30,159
and you're trying to get that that layer

4047
02:17:28,718 --> 02:17:32,558
to to happen

4048
02:17:30,159 --> 02:17:34,478
um you're gonna use a lot more uh

4049
02:17:32,558 --> 02:17:35,438
heavily concentrated version again i was

4050
02:17:34,478 --> 02:17:39,039
using

4051
02:17:35,439 --> 02:17:42,960
uh five four four to five to one

4052
02:17:39,040 --> 02:17:46,319
water to humic acid but my humic acid

4053
02:17:42,959 --> 02:17:47,759
you gotta understand is is like super

4054
02:17:46,318 --> 02:17:49,760
dark chocolate milk

4055
02:17:47,760 --> 02:17:52,159
i mean it's it's not like what you're

4056
02:17:49,760 --> 02:17:54,478
gonna get when you purchase it

4057
02:17:52,159 --> 02:17:56,478
um and and if you're gonna purchase

4058
02:17:54,478 --> 02:17:58,079
something again go with bio egg and then

4059
02:17:56,478 --> 02:17:58,718
i would read the label as to what makes

4060
02:17:58,079 --> 02:18:02,079
sense

4061
02:17:58,718 --> 02:18:03,518
if you're just doing a a general drench

4062
02:18:02,079 --> 02:18:05,439
you don't need a lot of it and

4063
02:18:03,519 --> 02:18:07,519
specifically with with fulvic acid the

4064
02:18:05,439 --> 02:18:10,479
dilution ratio is crazy it's one

4065
02:18:07,519 --> 02:18:12,478
one to a hundred anything more than that

4066
02:18:10,478 --> 02:18:14,638
you're wasting your wasting material

4067
02:18:12,478 --> 02:18:16,558
or you're just donating it to the soil

4068
02:18:14,638 --> 02:18:19,598
system but remember

4069
02:18:16,558 --> 02:18:21,279
the fulvic acid molecule is so small

4070
02:18:19,599 --> 02:18:23,040
that it will wash right down through the

4071
02:18:21,280 --> 02:18:25,200
soil profile

4072
02:18:23,040 --> 02:18:26,960
it's not biologically active so it's not

4073
02:18:25,200 --> 02:18:28,719
going to stick

4074
02:18:26,959 --> 02:18:31,678
so again with the humic acid i would

4075
02:18:28,718 --> 02:18:34,318
read the the label of on bioax products

4076
02:18:31,679 --> 02:18:35,840
as to what it is and and again it's like

4077
02:18:34,318 --> 02:18:38,398
you're going to use one dilution for

4078
02:18:35,840 --> 02:18:40,239
soil and one dilution for a foliar

4079
02:18:38,398 --> 02:18:42,079
so again it would be read the directions

4080
02:18:40,239 --> 02:18:45,039
but if you're trying to you're trying to

4081
02:18:42,079 --> 02:18:46,079
fix sand or turn sand into soil very

4082
02:18:45,040 --> 02:18:47,760
concentrated

4083
02:18:46,079 --> 02:18:49,519
and again i would just experiment i

4084
02:18:47,760 --> 02:18:51,040
would try you know a little patch and

4085
02:18:49,519 --> 02:18:53,439
see what happened

4086
02:18:51,040 --> 02:18:54,319
big proponent of of trying side by sides

4087
02:18:53,439 --> 02:18:56,239
and trialing

4088
02:18:54,318 --> 02:18:59,519
and experimenting that really helps you

4089
02:18:56,239 --> 02:18:59,519
get through the humps quickly

4090
02:18:59,599 --> 02:19:02,880
all right so we're going to wrap up

4091
02:19:01,359 --> 02:19:03,760
shortly here so we can get to the next

4092
02:19:02,879 --> 02:19:06,718
session so

4093
02:19:03,760 --> 02:19:07,519
just call last couple questions um sure

4094
02:19:06,718 --> 02:19:09,119
someone asked

4095
02:19:07,519 --> 02:19:10,719
are there pre-made super soils

4096
02:19:09,120 --> 02:19:11,280
comparable to what we're talking about

4097
02:19:10,718 --> 02:19:14,879
today

4098
02:19:11,280 --> 02:19:17,599
for the backyard grower yes there

4099
02:19:14,879 --> 02:19:18,079
are a number of uh super soil companies

4100
02:19:17,599 --> 02:19:21,280
out there

4101
02:19:18,079 --> 02:19:23,120
soilscape solutions uh build a soil in

4102
02:19:21,280 --> 02:19:24,559
colorado soilscapes is out here on the

4103
02:19:23,120 --> 02:19:26,719
west coast

4104
02:19:24,558 --> 02:19:28,478
um and i would i would go with someone

4105
02:19:26,718 --> 02:19:31,438
very experienced i would not

4106
02:19:28,478 --> 02:19:32,318
go with the mom and pop that hasn't had

4107
02:19:31,439 --> 02:19:34,239
a tremendous

4108
02:19:32,318 --> 02:19:36,398
time amount of time to learn their

4109
02:19:34,239 --> 02:19:39,119
lessons and by that i mean

4110
02:19:36,398 --> 02:19:40,959
not make mistakes but learn your lessons

4111
02:19:39,120 --> 02:19:42,559
one of the biggest problems with

4112
02:19:40,959 --> 02:19:44,799
someone who doesn't have a lot of

4113
02:19:42,558 --> 02:19:46,079
experience in blending these things

4114
02:19:44,799 --> 02:19:48,159
chances of them blending them

4115
02:19:46,079 --> 02:19:50,799
inappropriately would be uh

4116
02:19:48,159 --> 02:19:53,280
a lot so just be again know your vendor

4117
02:19:50,799 --> 02:19:54,879
know your supplier ask for references

4118
02:19:53,280 --> 02:19:57,359
talk to those references how did the

4119
02:19:54,879 --> 02:19:58,879
soil work how did it perform did it

4120
02:19:57,359 --> 02:19:59,600
leach out a bunch of fines out the

4121
02:19:58,879 --> 02:20:01,519
bottom

4122
02:19:59,600 --> 02:20:03,680
did my plants ever hit any kind of

4123
02:20:01,520 --> 02:20:05,280
deficiency or did i ever get into

4124
02:20:03,680 --> 02:20:08,318
nutrient lock using it

4125
02:20:05,280 --> 02:20:09,920
so just do your homework on that

4126
02:20:08,318 --> 02:20:12,719
all right and then we had a few

4127
02:20:09,920 --> 02:20:15,439
questions at least about um using pumice

4128
02:20:12,719 --> 02:20:16,799
uh is pumice an appropriate choice for

4129
02:20:15,439 --> 02:20:18,318
an alluvial layer

4130
02:20:16,799 --> 02:20:20,000
or just what would you use pumice for

4131
02:20:18,318 --> 02:20:22,079
would you use powder um i would use

4132
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:24,398
pumice for an aeration

4133
02:20:22,079 --> 02:20:25,680
so similar to rice holes um it's it's

4134
02:20:24,398 --> 02:20:28,318
got some water storing

4135
02:20:25,680 --> 02:20:29,920
storage capacity it has some irregular

4136
02:20:28,318 --> 02:20:31,600
shapes so that you can create pockets

4137
02:20:29,920 --> 02:20:34,079
for the biology to set up home

4138
02:20:31,600 --> 02:20:35,920
or set up condominiums so in that regard

4139
02:20:34,079 --> 02:20:37,039
i'd use it there i would not use it in

4140
02:20:35,920 --> 02:20:39,040
my

4141
02:20:37,040 --> 02:20:41,439
e-horizon what you really want for knee

4142
02:20:39,040 --> 02:20:41,760
horizon is diversity so you're looking

4143
02:20:41,439 --> 02:20:44,479
for

4144
02:20:41,760 --> 02:20:46,639
all different color rocks and you don't

4145
02:20:44,478 --> 02:20:48,559
want round rocks because the round rocks

4146
02:20:46,639 --> 02:20:49,840
are difficult for the bacteria to set up

4147
02:20:48,559 --> 02:20:52,478
their biofilm

4148
02:20:49,840 --> 02:20:54,960
and they're basically polished smooth so

4149
02:20:52,478 --> 02:20:57,840
it takes a long time for that biology

4150
02:20:54,959 --> 02:20:58,639
to actually build a niche to protect

4151
02:20:57,840 --> 02:21:00,398
itself

4152
02:20:58,639 --> 02:21:02,159
so what i recommend people do is you go

4153
02:21:00,398 --> 02:21:03,920
to the river you find all these round

4154
02:21:02,159 --> 02:21:06,079
rocks that are all different colors

4155
02:21:03,920 --> 02:21:07,120
and smash them up get good in stone and

4156
02:21:06,079 --> 02:21:07,920
beat the hell out of them with a

4157
02:21:07,120 --> 02:21:09,840
sledgehammer

4158
02:21:07,920 --> 02:21:12,000
and make as many jagged corners as you

4159
02:21:09,840 --> 02:21:14,159
can because the more jagged they are the

4160
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:15,600
more surface area that the biology has a

4161
02:21:14,159 --> 02:21:17,920
chance to set up on

4162
02:21:15,600 --> 02:21:19,600
and mine and again the different colors

4163
02:21:17,920 --> 02:21:23,120
represent different minerals

4164
02:21:19,600 --> 02:21:27,200
uh in in the stone itself

4165
02:21:23,120 --> 02:21:30,000
all right um and just lastly uh

4166
02:21:27,200 --> 02:21:30,479
um somebody had asked about the johnson

4167
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:32,879
sioux

4168
02:21:30,478 --> 02:21:35,199
bioreactor are you very familiar with

4169
02:21:32,879 --> 02:21:37,039
that lately

4170
02:21:35,200 --> 02:21:39,200
oh man you know what's so funny is i

4171
02:21:37,040 --> 02:21:40,560
used the term bioreactor for years and i

4172
02:21:39,200 --> 02:21:42,720
never heard anybody

4173
02:21:40,559 --> 02:21:43,600
question it right and then list

4174
02:21:42,719 --> 02:21:45,519
literally like

4175
02:21:43,600 --> 02:21:46,720
three times four times in the last few

4176
02:21:45,520 --> 02:21:48,159
months i've said that and they're like

4177
02:21:46,719 --> 02:21:51,920
oh johnson sue

4178
02:21:48,159 --> 02:21:51,920
and i'm like who the hell is johnson sue

4179
02:21:53,200 --> 02:21:57,120
so i finally did the homework to figure

4180
02:21:54,959 --> 02:21:58,398
out who this was and it was a couple

4181
02:21:57,120 --> 02:22:01,600
that had put together

4182
02:21:58,398 --> 02:22:03,760
a composting method that they let

4183
02:22:01,600 --> 02:22:06,479
sit for a year and that was what they

4184
02:22:03,760 --> 02:22:08,639
called the johnson suit bioreactor

4185
02:22:06,478 --> 02:22:10,000
this is different but it's it's

4186
02:22:08,639 --> 02:22:11,599
basically like use your head like think

4187
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:13,200
about it as like this little

4188
02:22:11,600 --> 02:22:14,880
you know nuclear reactor so what's

4189
02:22:13,200 --> 02:22:16,960
happening in that sphere about a third

4190
02:22:14,879 --> 02:22:19,759
of the way down in the in this pile

4191
02:22:16,959 --> 02:22:22,159
is where all the magic is happening so

4192
02:22:19,760 --> 02:22:22,639
you know i didn't mean to to steal their

4193
02:22:22,159 --> 02:22:25,600
term

4194
02:22:22,639 --> 02:22:26,799
but i just used it because in my mind it

4195
02:22:25,600 --> 02:22:29,359
made sense that that

4196
02:22:26,799 --> 02:22:29,840
that sphere was was a reactor of some

4197
02:22:29,359 --> 02:22:31,120
kind

4198
02:22:29,840 --> 02:22:33,600
that's where all that magic was

4199
02:22:31,120 --> 02:22:36,960
happening so i'm now familiar with

4200
02:22:33,600 --> 02:22:40,159
who they are but uh not comparing them

4201
02:22:36,959 --> 02:22:42,478
or it's not the exact same system

4202
02:22:40,159 --> 02:22:43,920
yeah all right all right well we've got

4203
02:22:42,478 --> 02:22:45,599
to wrap it up now and get over to

4204
02:22:43,920 --> 02:22:46,318
elaine's presentation starting in about

4205
02:22:45,600 --> 02:22:49,040
five minutes

4206
02:22:46,318 --> 02:22:51,119
um so thanks everyone thank you leighton

4207
02:22:49,040 --> 02:22:52,640
that was awesome

4208
02:22:51,120 --> 02:22:56,000
looking forward to the next one we're

4209
02:22:52,639 --> 02:22:58,159
really going to go deep guys really deep

4210
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:58,159
all right
