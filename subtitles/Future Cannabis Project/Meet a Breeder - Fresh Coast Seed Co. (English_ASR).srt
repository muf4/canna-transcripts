1
00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:09,089
how long has the company been going the

2
00:00:07,528 --> 00:00:11,519
company yeah the company has been going

3
00:00:09,089 --> 00:00:12,990
for probably about four years now got it

4
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,089
he started it but we have been growing

5
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:16,710
you know behind the scenes for sure it

6
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:22,710
just we're meant to wake up one day and

7
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:25,018
do that yeah in Michigan the whole time

8
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:27,630
yep okay I've been in Michigan the whole

9
00:00:25,018 --> 00:00:29,368
time you know and then at the time I

10
00:00:27,629 --> 00:00:31,768
went down to MSU and got my degree there

11
00:00:29,368 --> 00:00:33,420
and just from there it kind of turned

12
00:00:31,768 --> 00:00:35,519
into this beautiful thing where we were

13
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:37,320
able to just yeah start working with the

14
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,120
plant and creating new strains of our

15
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,520
own and testing them in there where

16
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:43,709
there are a lot of cannabis growers in

17
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,570
at MSU when you went to school with them

18
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,829
you know there weren't really at the

19
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:48,238
time there were the guys that were

20
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:50,100
growing in their closets or their

21
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:52,169
basements but a lot of people at least

22
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,030
that were in my graduating class really

23
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:56,969
focused on the organic farming and their

24
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:59,280
degrees and stuff like that but you know

25
00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:00,719
now I see universities I don't know I

26
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,910
think it's like northern or something

27
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,650
like that they have a cannabis

28
00:01:02,909 --> 00:01:07,109
production class actually it's a course

29
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:09,000
at the University that was funny how you

30
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:11,250
could at one point a couple years ago

31
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,170
get kicked out of college for cannabis

32
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:15,359
and now they're teaching you how to grow

33
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:17,728
cannabis you know the in Pueblo Colorado

34
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:21,978
which is just south of Denver on that

35
00:01:17,728 --> 00:01:25,039
front I 25 Front Range there's a CSU

36
00:01:21,978 --> 00:01:27,289
division or branch or universe

37
00:01:25,039 --> 00:01:29,539
and they have a cannabis studies

38
00:01:27,289 --> 00:01:30,560
master's degree program it's been there

39
00:01:29,539 --> 00:01:32,329
for a couple of years and you're like

40
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,969
what yeah you're like what is this now

41
00:01:32,328 --> 00:01:36,649
yeah it's funny back in the day you know

42
00:01:34,968 --> 00:01:38,868
if they would have called it you know

43
00:01:36,649 --> 00:01:40,519
hydroponics you know growing or like how

44
00:01:38,868 --> 00:01:44,090
to grow cannabis in your closet you know

45
00:01:40,519 --> 00:01:45,978
they would have had you know 10 15 20

46
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:48,380
people just be like you know what like

47
00:01:45,978 --> 00:01:49,938
yeah I am here to grow cannabis and he

48
00:01:48,379 --> 00:01:52,039
was saying a lot of people would show up

49
00:01:49,938 --> 00:01:53,688
for his green house classes and stuff

50
00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:55,280
like that and you know he could tell

51
00:01:53,688 --> 00:01:56,928
they weren't actually interested in

52
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,609
learning how to do a commercial green

53
00:01:56,929 --> 00:02:03,740
house of sorts they were just there to

54
00:01:58,609 --> 00:02:05,599
you know grow flower but yeah we got

55
00:02:03,739 --> 00:02:07,158
into the whole breeding thing you know

56
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:09,049
actually my business partner approached

57
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:11,000
me one day I was working at a hydro

58
00:02:09,049 --> 00:02:12,349
store at the time and he was like you

59
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,329
know what man we should start a seed

60
00:02:12,348 --> 00:02:16,250
company and I was like sounds like a

61
00:02:14,329 --> 00:02:18,019
great idea and six months later I quit

62
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:19,699
my job and we started doing this full

63
00:02:18,019 --> 00:02:21,890
time and we were growing at the time to

64
00:02:19,699 --> 00:02:24,709
support ourselves and we just really

65
00:02:21,889 --> 00:02:27,589
wanted to do something where we were

66
00:02:24,709 --> 00:02:30,039
able to be creative and create a product

67
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:32,810
that somebody else could also experience

68
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:34,638
and that started about four years ago

69
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:37,930
and now we've got seeds all over the

70
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:40,909
world from Australia to Spain the UK

71
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:42,920
u.s. you know East Coast to west coast

72
00:02:40,909 --> 00:02:47,180
and up into Canada as well so it's

73
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:48,919
really been you know a crazy growth over

74
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:51,620
the last four years we went from I think

75
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:53,539
two followers on our Instagram and now

76
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:56,030
we're up to almost 13,000 and we're

77
00:02:53,539 --> 00:02:57,798
seeing pictures of plants you know that

78
00:02:56,030 --> 00:03:00,169
people are growing of our strains and

79
00:02:57,799 --> 00:03:02,239
it's it's cool it's it allows us to be

80
00:03:00,169 --> 00:03:04,608
creative and you know we bar what are

81
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:05,730
you want to be known for strand like are

82
00:03:04,609 --> 00:03:08,040
you guys

83
00:03:05,729 --> 00:03:09,539
the trends are you going in your own

84
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:12,479
direction and saying they're gonna be

85
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:15,030
people who appreciate what we're creator

86
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:16,679
and I guess with what we're doing is

87
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:18,449
we're just looking to kind of follow our

88
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,879
own path we want to work with the things

89
00:03:18,449 --> 00:03:23,399
that we've created to continue to

90
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:25,469
develop on those but at the same time

91
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,750
you know maybe take a step back and look

92
00:03:25,469 --> 00:03:29,400
into more of the land race and some of

93
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:32,039
the original varietals that were out

94
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:35,310
there before you know all this

95
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:37,889
cross-pollination all this giant melting

96
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:40,560
pot essentially has come about and kind

97
00:03:37,889 --> 00:03:43,559
of looked backwards and bring some of

98
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:46,650
the old strains into the future might

99
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:48,959
give you some examples so like with some

100
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:50,760
Death Star strains that's something that

101
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,709
we've been looking into working with we

102
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:55,378
actually ran across an individual who

103
00:03:52,709 --> 00:03:57,659
has a plethora of heirloom land race

104
00:03:55,378 --> 00:04:01,259
genetics that he's collected from

105
00:03:57,659 --> 00:04:04,219
Colombia in India in Thailand and just

106
00:04:01,259 --> 00:04:06,328
all over the place and they're you know

107
00:04:04,219 --> 00:04:07,949
2530 years old and he's just kind of

108
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:09,930
been stashing all these away and he

109
00:04:07,949 --> 00:04:11,369
approached us actually at a grow event a

110
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:13,680
couple months back and was like by the

111
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:16,019
way I have all this stuff and he busted

112
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,819
out his seedless then we just about shit

113
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:19,739
our pants when we found out what he had

114
00:04:17,819 --> 00:04:21,509
you know he had original sin sea stars

115
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:24,329
there's all sorts of stuff that you

116
00:04:21,509 --> 00:04:28,079
can't get anymore so I'd like to hear

117
00:04:24,329 --> 00:04:29,680
something about the learning curve in a

118
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:31,418
genetics program how

119
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,639
of that education that you get at school

120
00:04:31,418 --> 00:04:35,439
and how much was it on the ground or

121
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:37,810
from your partners and what are the big

122
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:41,139
hurdles I mean you think about breeding

123
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:44,079
programs taking a long time even decades

124
00:04:41,139 --> 00:04:45,728
in traditional crops and you get F ones

125
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:46,889
and f2 is relatively quick in this

126
00:04:45,728 --> 00:04:49,359
particular crop

127
00:04:46,889 --> 00:04:51,639
what is the diligence and the challenge

128
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:54,160
to get high-quality repeatable genetics

129
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:56,530
from from your experience well it

130
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,810
definitely takes time and it's it's very

131
00:04:56,529 --> 00:05:00,609
meticulous work in regards to you have

132
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:02,918
to be paying attention to everything you

133
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:04,810
know from vigor to the overall plant

134
00:05:02,918 --> 00:05:06,698
structure you know how much does this

135
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:09,300
plant eat you know what's its terpene

136
00:05:06,699 --> 00:05:12,819
profile what you know what does the leaf

137
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:14,470
variegation look like and so what we had

138
00:05:12,819 --> 00:05:18,279
you know in our peanut butter breadth

139
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:19,990
project we had used the leaf variegation

140
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:22,299
on the edge of the leaf to be a real

141
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:24,550
indicator trait for us because the ocean

142
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:27,370
grown khush breath or the ogk bee has

143
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:28,870
that wild duck foot going on and you can

144
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:32,050
tell when you get something it looks

145
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:33,879
very mutant and not normal and then

146
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:35,199
there's you know the more dosey doe side

147
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:38,139
and so with our peanut butter breath

148
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:39,939
line not only were we able to decipher

149
00:05:38,139 --> 00:05:42,038
you know what we were getting from the

150
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:45,310
physical traits but also the color and

151
00:05:42,038 --> 00:05:47,918
the frost content but it takes time to

152
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:49,959
get there you know and nowadays like you

153
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:51,819
said the F ones and f2s are they're

154
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:53,620
easier to come up with and everybody's

155
00:05:51,819 --> 00:05:55,478
doing it but to really truly you know

156
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:57,189
get an inbred line you have to get you

157
00:05:55,478 --> 00:05:59,589
know many generations deep into your

158
00:05:57,189 --> 00:06:02,168
project and it takes a lot of time and

159
00:05:59,589 --> 00:06:04,779
MSU when I was there I had taken plants

160
00:06:02,168 --> 00:06:07,899
plant genetic courses and you know you

161
00:06:04,779 --> 00:06:09,939
get into the really intricate parts of

162
00:06:07,899 --> 00:06:12,158
it you know more much further than the

163
00:06:09,939 --> 00:06:13,990
punnett squares and you know all those

164
00:06:12,158 --> 00:06:16,329
science experiments you know you would

165
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:19,300
do back in grade school but it it gets

166
00:06:16,329 --> 00:06:22,209
deeper than that and to to see a project

167
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:24,129
come to fruition and you can see the

168
00:06:22,209 --> 00:06:25,930
mother and the father's distinct traits

169
00:06:24,129 --> 00:06:27,870
you know passed down to those next V

170
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:30,668
Lisle generations is really a neat thing

171
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:32,389
especially too when you're seeing the

172
00:06:30,668 --> 00:06:34,909
same results in other

173
00:06:32,389 --> 00:06:38,959
gardens yeah so it but it takes time and

174
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:40,640
yeah figuring out you know figuring out

175
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:42,289
what makes sense you know you're not

176
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,329
just gonna put two totally random

177
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:46,160
species of plant together and you know

178
00:06:44,329 --> 00:06:48,469
be like alright this is the one that it

179
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,540
takes looking at you know the parental

180
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:53,390
lineages and figuring out what you're

181
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:55,310
really trying to capture out of crossing

182
00:06:53,389 --> 00:06:57,979
those two you know without yeah I don't

183
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:59,870
want to want to call anyone out some not

184
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:01,550
an expert I'm not a horticultural so I

185
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:03,410
plan to notice is I'm gonna happen

186
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:05,650
gardner-webb grew up as a gardener in my

187
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:08,600
microbiology yeah completely different

188
00:07:05,649 --> 00:07:10,339
how many people actually get genetics

189
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:12,140
relatively speaking to people that are

190
00:07:10,339 --> 00:07:13,639
doing genetics I mean you sound like you

191
00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:16,699
have some classical training you do you

192
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:18,620
want to MSU great University do most

193
00:07:16,699 --> 00:07:23,899
people understand it how many people are

194
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:24,920
just winging it I would say probably 60%

195
00:07:23,899 --> 00:07:29,959
of them are winging it

196
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:31,550
Wow yeah and not necessarily saying that

197
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:32,719
they're winging it just throwing pollen

198
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:35,660
in their room but they're not

199
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:40,070
necessarily you know making a decision

200
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:41,600
in crafting a experiment if you will you

201
00:07:40,069 --> 00:07:43,730
know where they have a hypothesis like

202
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:45,110
okay this is my mail this is my female

203
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:46,640
this is what I'm trying to get out of

204
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:48,080
this and then doing the experiment and

205
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:49,819
following through on the conclusions by

206
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:51,349
testing the progeny and really figuring

207
00:07:49,819 --> 00:07:54,139
out what you've got you know a lot of

208
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:55,970
these people will test up a couple times

209
00:07:54,139 --> 00:07:59,029
and you know they might put it out on

210
00:07:55,970 --> 00:08:01,040
the market and typically you see people

211
00:07:59,029 --> 00:08:04,699
that are doing that they will sell the

212
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:07,310
seeds for cheaper you know they're 40 50

213
00:08:04,699 --> 00:08:09,889
dollars a pack on certain stuff but you

214
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:11,660
know we we believe in our line and we've

215
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:13,819
tested ours you know for three years

216
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:15,500
consistently ourselves as well as giving

217
00:08:13,819 --> 00:08:17,779
it out you know to our testers all

218
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:19,220
around the country and they're getting

219
00:08:17,779 --> 00:08:21,049
the same results that we are so weird

220
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:23,020
confident you know in that we're seeing

221
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:26,449
the same results over and over again

222
00:08:23,019 --> 00:08:28,819
it's still a gap in the at least the

223
00:08:26,449 --> 00:08:30,439
adherence to an experimental design and

224
00:08:28,819 --> 00:08:32,240
the follow-through of actually that

225
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:34,399
rigorous data collection and

226
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,558
and that repetition from lineage lineage

227
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:39,469
to validate you think that's the gap

228
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:41,478
yeah I do and not necessarily that it's

229
00:08:39,469 --> 00:08:43,519
a gap because you know some of our most

230
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:45,079
popular strains they'll come dog I was

231
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:47,299
bag seat if you will

232
00:08:45,078 --> 00:08:49,909
originally and you know everybody knows

233
00:08:47,299 --> 00:08:52,219
that no and so who's to say the next one

234
00:08:49,909 --> 00:08:54,708
couldn't be it's definitely you know

235
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:57,379
becoming saturated you know the entire

236
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:58,969
gene pool overall but that's exciting

237
00:08:57,379 --> 00:09:00,499
you know and that's where I think there

238
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:02,928
will be new people that step in that

239
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:04,579
could potentially introduce the species

240
00:09:02,928 --> 00:09:05,778
or a strain that no one's ever seen

241
00:09:04,578 --> 00:09:08,299
before

242
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:10,850
just in terms of its physical appearance

243
00:09:08,299 --> 00:09:13,428
or you know terpene profile or anything

244
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:15,319
like that so I think with the industry

245
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:16,759
at growing the way that it is and all

246
00:09:15,318 --> 00:09:19,278
the new techniques that are being

247
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:21,139
developed and strains that yet people

248
00:09:19,278 --> 00:09:23,778
are trying to come up with it it

249
00:09:21,139 --> 00:09:25,818
definitely has the progress and I can

250
00:09:23,778 --> 00:09:27,948
see it continuing to progress for the

251
00:09:25,818 --> 00:09:30,110
next ten years so it sort of ceiling on

252
00:09:27,948 --> 00:09:33,049
this for me you know I think there's a

253
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:38,629
lot of overlap and we it's progressed so

254
00:09:33,049 --> 00:09:40,719
far how far will it go at this point I

255
00:09:38,629 --> 00:09:43,369
think there's really no limit you know

256
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,569
we're still the innovators in this thing

257
00:09:43,369 --> 00:09:47,689
you know I don't even think we've really

258
00:09:44,568 --> 00:09:48,979
hit the growth stage yet let's kind of a

259
00:09:47,688 --> 00:09:50,419
big statement compared to everything

260
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:51,949
that's going on relative to everything

261
00:09:50,419 --> 00:09:54,169
going on right now that we have I mean

262
00:09:51,948 --> 00:09:57,169
think about yeah how many states still

263
00:09:54,169 --> 00:09:58,519
are you know not allowing us to do this

264
00:09:57,169 --> 00:10:00,198
fair enough

265
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:02,058
from a production but I mean from a

266
00:10:00,198 --> 00:10:03,828
genetics and a diversity point of view

267
00:10:02,058 --> 00:10:06,889
is there things that just haven't been

268
00:10:03,828 --> 00:10:08,928
tapped into yet you know I think there

269
00:10:06,889 --> 00:10:10,579
are and I think a lot of those traits

270
00:10:08,928 --> 00:10:13,428
that we may be looking for

271
00:10:10,578 --> 00:10:14,649
lie back in those land race heirloom

272
00:10:13,428 --> 00:10:16,870
rubber

273
00:10:14,649 --> 00:10:18,339
you know who's to say that yeah it

274
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:20,440
couldn't come from something new but I

275
00:10:18,339 --> 00:10:22,240
think a lot of the stuff that we're

276
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:24,130
looking for or that was originally

277
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:28,480
created you know on this planet by

278
00:10:24,129 --> 00:10:30,970
whatever that may be you know those are

279
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,889
true genetics and those are true species

280
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:35,230
you know if they're poor and you don't

281
00:10:32,889 --> 00:10:36,789
find a lot of that any longer so you

282
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:38,680
know I have a question that someone asks

283
00:10:36,789 --> 00:10:40,269
me again and I don't know but we talked

284
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:42,429
about genetics I love talking about this

285
00:10:40,269 --> 00:10:43,870
topic so I'm not an expert in it so

286
00:10:42,429 --> 00:10:45,939
everything I've talked about and getting

287
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:48,519
information in is new kernels of

288
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:49,990
knowledge and so thanks for doing this I

289
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:54,519
have a question for you how do you pick

290
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:56,139
males so selecting our males is pretty

291
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:59,709
much how you know you would select a

292
00:10:56,139 --> 00:11:02,829
female in terms of you grow it start to

293
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:04,388
finish you have multiple clones on it so

294
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:06,278
you're gonna run yours select it and

295
00:11:04,389 --> 00:11:08,259
then you're gonna run it again and in

296
00:11:06,278 --> 00:11:10,240
that second run you know you can stress

297
00:11:08,259 --> 00:11:12,818
test them you know you can just ask for

298
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,860
disease resistance a lot of people you

299
00:11:12,818 --> 00:11:16,719
know they'll experience issues when they

300
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:18,100
let their male go it'll start to her

301
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,129
mout on them at the end and that's not

302
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:23,050
necessarily a indicator of stability you

303
00:11:21,129 --> 00:11:25,659
know letting it run a long time so

304
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:27,370
really running your male start to finish

305
00:11:25,659 --> 00:11:29,828
and then again like I said where you're

306
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:32,409
looking for you know a stem rub or a

307
00:11:29,828 --> 00:11:35,318
certain leaf you know variation pattern

308
00:11:32,409 --> 00:11:38,198
around the leaf margin or just structure

309
00:11:35,318 --> 00:11:39,610
overall you know bigger all those things

310
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:41,588
come into the equation it's kind of

311
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:43,899
analyzing and you know making your best

312
00:11:41,589 --> 00:11:45,310
educated guess on what you deem the best

313
00:11:43,899 --> 00:11:47,470
and then obviously you know you can get

314
00:11:45,309 --> 00:11:50,969
the plant tested as well at the end of

315
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:53,800
its growth cycle to kind of determine a

316
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:55,990
average percentage that's actually

317
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:57,240
really helpful for me it's because I'm

318
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:59,369
always under

319
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:01,528
on females or certain traits at least

320
00:11:59,369 --> 00:12:04,350
and a lot of people chase the THC for a

321
00:12:01,528 --> 00:12:06,299
long time and so like get that measuring

322
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:07,920
trade and it seemed like it was harder

323
00:12:06,299 --> 00:12:10,318
for me to understand conceptually how to

324
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:12,240
measure or what to want what I would

325
00:12:10,318 --> 00:12:14,099
want to measure out a melon we have we

326
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,720
have high CBD farms reason for

327
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:18,178
agriculture purposes mostly for our

328
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:21,660
inputs and looking at certain metrics of

329
00:12:18,178 --> 00:12:23,698
chemical constituents CBD cannabidiol it

330
00:12:21,659 --> 00:12:25,019
in general terrine and then yielding

331
00:12:23,698 --> 00:12:26,938
growth and maybe routing or whatever

332
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:28,230
we're kind of targeting but we don't

333
00:12:26,938 --> 00:12:29,428
have a breeding and we don't do that

334
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:32,759
it's more of agronomic

335
00:12:29,428 --> 00:12:34,259
and for for growth patterns and

336
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:36,629
different inputs natural inputs and

337
00:12:34,259 --> 00:12:39,058
because that's what our wheelhouse is it

338
00:12:36,629 --> 00:12:42,209
makes sense to me that you could really

339
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:43,828
do diligent stress test resilience tests

340
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:46,018
on the males to make sure you at least

341
00:12:43,828 --> 00:12:46,678
have some of those pest resistance

342
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:48,869
traits

343
00:12:46,678 --> 00:12:50,369
those are ease more easily conceptually

344
00:12:48,869 --> 00:12:52,259
measured in the males it may be

345
00:12:50,369 --> 00:12:54,209
structure and morphology that's kind of

346
00:12:52,259 --> 00:12:55,889
what I heard and the females you want to

347
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:57,868
couple that along with some nice

348
00:12:55,889 --> 00:13:00,419
characteristics of the flavor qualities

349
00:12:57,869 --> 00:13:02,069
and whatnot right yeah and then - yeah

350
00:13:00,419 --> 00:13:05,068
and then after you put that all together

351
00:13:02,068 --> 00:13:06,688
you know your final product is the mix

352
00:13:05,068 --> 00:13:09,058
of all that and you're able to identify

353
00:13:06,688 --> 00:13:10,708
that and see that and that's that's what

354
00:13:09,058 --> 00:13:12,719
it's all about at the end would you

355
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:15,778
measure terpenes or cannabinoids in a

356
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,980
male yeah oh yeah that is actually you

357
00:13:15,778 --> 00:13:19,379
know one of the ways that we select

358
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:21,420
males we do stem rubs if one's more than

359
00:13:19,379 --> 00:13:23,188
the other or they may even be the same

360
00:13:21,419 --> 00:13:25,798
strain but they do have a slightly

361
00:13:23,188 --> 00:13:27,419
different smell to them and it's like

362
00:13:25,798 --> 00:13:29,759
well this one's more appealing than this

363
00:13:27,419 --> 00:13:31,678
but this one might smell more you know

364
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:34,980
prominently that did they teach you to

365
00:13:31,678 --> 00:13:36,289
stamp rough technique in school ah no

366
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:39,678
they did it

367
00:13:36,289 --> 00:13:42,919
no no they did not

368
00:13:39,678 --> 00:13:42,919
unfortunately yeah

369
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:51,070
the cannabis industry technique

370
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:52,330
nomenclature horticultural go so there's

371
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:55,420
a lot of people you know that are

372
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:58,720
classifying things as what they say they

373
00:13:55,419 --> 00:13:59,949
are but when it really get down to it so

374
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,379
in terms of you know feel I'll

375
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:05,770
generations or doing an inbred line or a

376
00:14:02,379 --> 00:14:07,899
back cross I think nowadays people are

377
00:14:05,769 --> 00:14:10,269
trying to catch on to the lingo it's

378
00:14:07,899 --> 00:14:11,799
something where you know I had learned

379
00:14:10,269 --> 00:14:13,210
it a long time ago so it all kind of

380
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:14,740
clicked for me and you know it made

381
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:18,150
sense in terms of what we were trying to

382
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:22,120
accomplish and really it's it's

383
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:23,829
something worth getting to know you know

384
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:25,960
for every grower in the industry so yeah

385
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:27,278
you can properly classify your plants

386
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:29,560
and you know if you're trying to sell

387
00:14:27,278 --> 00:14:32,230
your seed stock especially being able to

388
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:34,959
tell people exactly where it is in its

389
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:37,659
breeding process you know first second

390
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:40,269
third feel I'll generation in and then

391
00:14:37,659 --> 00:14:42,730
so we're talking f1 f2 f3 and that's a

392
00:14:40,269 --> 00:14:44,769
proper nomenclature for that first

393
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:46,980
generation second bred generation third

394
00:14:44,769 --> 00:14:50,769
bred generation and that would be having

395
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:52,389
perhaps a static pollen donor with the

396
00:14:50,769 --> 00:14:54,789
reoccurring mother breeds and then

397
00:14:52,389 --> 00:14:56,528
taking seeds from that yep and so you

398
00:14:54,789 --> 00:14:59,469
can work your way down and then yeah it

399
00:14:56,528 --> 00:15:01,240
depends on how yeah you're looking to

400
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:02,740
breed back and what your end goal is you

401
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:04,659
know if you're looking to at the end

402
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:06,039
ultimately create that inbred line that

403
00:15:04,659 --> 00:15:08,740
you've just been putting back into

404
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:11,199
itself or if you're looking yet to do

405
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:13,209
you know an f1 or an f2 and then use

406
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:15,730
something from there to do another

407
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:18,519
project once you know if you feel that

408
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:20,649
that plant that you're using is stable

409
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:23,379
and you better have it seems like you

410
00:15:20,649 --> 00:15:25,838
better have a real vision as a plant

411
00:15:23,379 --> 00:15:27,250
breeder because there's just a thousand

412
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:29,800
directions you can go with any one

413
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:31,480
generation yep and that's it's just you

414
00:15:29,799 --> 00:15:33,009
know like anything like if you're in the

415
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:34,959
stock market or if you're starting a

416
00:15:33,009 --> 00:15:38,950
business you know really having a plan

417
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:40,299
to to put into action and following

418
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:42,400
through on that and ensuring that

419
00:15:40,299 --> 00:15:45,009
everything is taken care of you know in

420
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:47,110
the same manner and you know we grow and

421
00:15:45,009 --> 00:15:48,559
breed organically so you know having

422
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:51,079
microbes like what you got

423
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:53,958
in the soil and having that symbiotic

424
00:15:51,078 --> 00:15:56,088
relationship is really key to ensure you

425
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:58,278
know success from start to finish on

426
00:15:56,089 --> 00:16:00,319
everything and so that's where we feel a

427
00:15:58,278 --> 00:16:01,610
lot of our really good germination rates

428
00:16:00,318 --> 00:16:03,469
come in

429
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:05,120
you know we're near ninety nine percent

430
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:07,339
on all of our germination rates you know

431
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,899
male the female ratios are about 50/50

432
00:16:07,339 --> 00:16:10,939
and then typically with our phenotypic

433
00:16:08,899 --> 00:16:13,429
ratios we'll see a three to one and that

434
00:16:10,938 --> 00:16:17,078
three to one on basing that on color

435
00:16:13,429 --> 00:16:19,849
specifically so the dominant color gene

436
00:16:17,078 --> 00:16:21,049
came through from our male so more

437
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:22,459
likely than not you're going to get

438
00:16:21,049 --> 00:16:25,248
something that's a dark purple as

439
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:28,219
compared to a green but at the

440
00:16:25,249 --> 00:16:30,800
probability game right exactly yep and

441
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:33,439
then you know with our females a lot of

442
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:36,139
them had a dominant terpene trait

443
00:16:33,438 --> 00:16:37,849
and so that was able to carry on down

444
00:16:36,139 --> 00:16:39,528
that lineage whereas the peanut butter

445
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:43,459
breath male that we used it had a

446
00:16:39,528 --> 00:16:45,558
recessive gene for terpenes so that was

447
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:47,778
the last dominant and that wouldn't

448
00:16:45,558 --> 00:16:49,578
carry down and so yeah like I said it's

449
00:16:47,778 --> 00:16:52,039
neat to see the creations come together

450
00:16:49,578 --> 00:16:55,068
you know at different stages different

451
00:16:52,039 --> 00:16:57,909
generations and see okay this is what's

452
00:16:55,068 --> 00:17:00,469
here where do we want to go with it now

453
00:16:57,909 --> 00:17:02,568
you know I spend a lot of time in Europe

454
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:04,788
and they talk about feminized seeds a

455
00:17:02,568 --> 00:17:07,038
lot yeah and you can chemically

456
00:17:04,788 --> 00:17:09,558
feminized seeds and it's very common

457
00:17:07,038 --> 00:17:11,929
practice and seeds a big business as a

458
00:17:09,558 --> 00:17:13,970
souvenir business in Europe you know

459
00:17:11,929 --> 00:17:17,600
that's the legal term for selling seeds

460
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:20,880
I don't understand maybe I should but

461
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:22,558
still how is that bad

462
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:25,439
the ultimate plant or is it just for

463
00:17:22,558 --> 00:17:26,548
birding in a safe stable layer I want to

464
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,830
hear your opinion on it

465
00:17:26,548 --> 00:17:34,470
so with feminized seeds essentially what

466
00:17:28,829 --> 00:17:37,048
you're doing is you were creating a

467
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:39,808
mutation within the chromosome so you're

468
00:17:37,048 --> 00:17:42,179
essentially creating a triploid which is

469
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:45,000
a mutation in chromosomal binding that

470
00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:46,769
is caused by the application of like a

471
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,720
kaleidoscope or product or something

472
00:17:46,769 --> 00:17:52,230
like that thus giving you a feminized

473
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:55,528
seed and so by not allowing that

474
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:57,450
chromosome to bind it's guaranteed that

475
00:17:55,528 --> 00:17:59,490
it's female but it could also create

476
00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:01,590
instabilities down the road potentially

477
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:03,149
you know that's just nature I mean there

478
00:18:01,589 --> 00:18:05,609
are transgendered people in the world

479
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:07,109
you know it's not an uncommon thing and

480
00:18:05,609 --> 00:18:08,878
so it's the same with plants we're very

481
00:18:07,109 --> 00:18:11,369
similar to them in terms of our genetic

482
00:18:08,878 --> 00:18:13,709
code and our breakdown it's a for true

483
00:18:11,369 --> 00:18:15,479
breeding program you would recommend not

484
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:18,000
doing that because of the introduction

485
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:20,669
where do you feel that it's not that big

486
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,019
of a deal well I think it it depends on

487
00:18:20,669 --> 00:18:23,549
your application you know if you were

488
00:18:22,019 --> 00:18:24,808
ever going to try to do a breeding

489
00:18:23,548 --> 00:18:27,179
project you wouldn't want to use

490
00:18:24,808 --> 00:18:31,558
anything feminized it would it you know

491
00:18:27,179 --> 00:18:33,000
be worth even trying it but for people

492
00:18:31,558 --> 00:18:34,859
who are getting into this a lot of

493
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,388
people want an easy route and you know

494
00:18:34,859 --> 00:18:38,069
it's just like the auto flower thing a

495
00:18:36,388 --> 00:18:39,869
lot of people shy away from that and

496
00:18:38,069 --> 00:18:41,128
don't want anything to do with it but

497
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:42,538
there are other people that swear by it

498
00:18:41,128 --> 00:18:43,648
because it works for them so I think

499
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:46,230
really at the end of the day it just

500
00:18:43,648 --> 00:18:51,388
kind of comes down to what you want to

501
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:53,970
do as a grower and the creation of

502
00:18:51,388 --> 00:18:55,619
feminized seeds it's essentially yeah

503
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:57,740
Akal idol silver which is a natural

504
00:18:55,619 --> 00:18:59,729
compound I mean you can drink it

505
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:01,679
obviously you probably wouldn't want to

506
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:05,548
consume the flowers after your colitis

507
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:08,070
over has been sprayed on it but in the

508
00:19:05,548 --> 00:19:11,009
end I think if you're you know following

509
00:19:08,069 --> 00:19:13,138
your initial intention and applying it

510
00:19:11,009 --> 00:19:15,450
at the proper times and really watching

511
00:19:13,138 --> 00:19:17,529
your plants develop and determining when

512
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:20,080
is the right maturation time for you

513
00:19:17,529 --> 00:19:23,049
to call it and you know start drying

514
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:26,259
your seeds and properly you know

515
00:19:23,049 --> 00:19:28,659
creating the seed then there's really no

516
00:19:26,259 --> 00:19:31,059
health risks I would say associated with

517
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:32,800
you know the seed directly in that plant

518
00:19:31,059 --> 00:19:34,419
that would be grown from that seed got

519
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:35,950
it awesome that's really helpful if you

520
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:37,539
guys hate that yeah no problem you know

521
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:39,430
I actually have another question I keep

522
00:19:37,539 --> 00:19:41,559
on thinking about things all this is new

523
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:44,590
so at some point we're gonna get shut

524
00:19:41,559 --> 00:19:48,419
down but while we're still on you know

525
00:19:44,589 --> 00:19:52,149
we talked about in Colorado the lack of

526
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:53,920
genetics for hemp farms where you know a

527
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:56,560
lot of the genetics they're they're

528
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:58,029
marketed as legal and you can grow them

529
00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:00,220
but then they end up going hot you have

530
00:19:58,029 --> 00:20:03,639
to be at that point three percent THC or

531
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:05,559
lower to be within that realm and so

532
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:07,030
that's a big opportunity and right now I

533
00:20:05,559 --> 00:20:08,649
guess the only way people are getting

534
00:20:07,029 --> 00:20:09,460
around and it's still challenging is

535
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:12,759
buying clones

536
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:14,529
is there a near-term future where there

537
00:20:12,759 --> 00:20:18,279
are going to be seeds and this is a

538
00:20:14,529 --> 00:20:19,779
two-part question that comply and you

539
00:20:18,279 --> 00:20:21,970
know one of the challenges I think is

540
00:20:19,779 --> 00:20:24,149
when you get down to that low of THC you

541
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:26,650
really compromise other cannabinoid

542
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:30,910
development where you can have a point

543
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:34,030
seven percent THC strain and have in the

544
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:37,029
titan CBD or the cannabinoid you know

545
00:20:34,029 --> 00:20:39,549
CBD a relative abundances and if you cut

546
00:20:37,029 --> 00:20:43,180
that down for every tenth of a percent

547
00:20:39,549 --> 00:20:44,690
you really decrease the amount of CBD

548
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:48,590
production right

549
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:50,929
is there is that a real correlation and

550
00:20:48,589 --> 00:20:53,509
and and where's the line do you think

551
00:20:50,929 --> 00:20:55,369
that's just lack of breeding lack of

552
00:20:53,509 --> 00:21:01,940
effort or is there a real limitation

553
00:20:55,368 --> 00:21:06,348
there you know yes and no I think it's

554
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:10,340
something where there is the potential

555
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:13,418
to you know create through breeding a

556
00:21:10,339 --> 00:21:16,189
strain that is stable and will

557
00:21:13,419 --> 00:21:18,679
consistently be below the threshold but

558
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:24,139
also there is genetic variation and

559
00:21:18,679 --> 00:21:26,210
there is that chance for a gene to you

560
00:21:24,138 --> 00:21:29,148
know put it above that point three and

561
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:31,450
so with I think all of the stuff that's

562
00:21:29,148 --> 00:21:34,668
going on right now you know really

563
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:37,159
focusing in on getting a certified seed

564
00:21:34,669 --> 00:21:39,769
to start with is what's going to be the

565
00:21:37,159 --> 00:21:41,960
most beneficial as compared to going you

566
00:21:39,769 --> 00:21:43,489
know through any Jo online that has hemp

567
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:47,210
seed that says hey this is what the

568
00:21:43,489 --> 00:21:49,700
cross is you know but I know they've

569
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:53,298
been doing it in Europe in Canada for a

570
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:56,960
very long time and I feel like those

571
00:21:53,298 --> 00:22:00,108
regions are going to be the areas that

572
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:02,419
we're looking to going forward you know

573
00:22:00,108 --> 00:22:04,548
more so than Colorado and California you

574
00:22:02,419 --> 00:22:06,200
know that they're new and everyone is

575
00:22:04,548 --> 00:22:07,999
just getting into it there and these

576
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:11,509
guys have been doing it for yet damn

577
00:22:07,999 --> 00:22:13,608
near 100 years or longer over across the

578
00:22:11,509 --> 00:22:14,899
ocean so you know do you think there's a

579
00:22:13,608 --> 00:22:15,919
big difference you know China's the

580
00:22:14,898 --> 00:22:18,079
number one Purdue

581
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:22,640
of hemp as an example we'll call it just

582
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:25,519
low low THC cannabis but it's mostly

583
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:27,410
bred before I think fiber and rarely

584
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:29,569
bred for its amount of seed production

585
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:31,160
or quality of nourished seed because

586
00:22:29,569 --> 00:22:35,000
that could be an interesting food source

587
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:37,790
or obviously for flower and an

588
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,410
extraction purposes and so if you find

589
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:41,450
most of the certified seed in Colorado

590
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:43,700
as an example they're certified but

591
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:45,559
they're certified under a fiber and a

592
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:48,200
couple are certified under a seed but

593
00:22:45,559 --> 00:22:51,079
none are really certified as a strong

594
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:53,299
producer for extract cannabinoids I

595
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:55,699
think that's interesting I think mostly

596
00:22:53,299 --> 00:22:57,169
because those have come from Europe do

597
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:59,600
you see that changing in the near future

598
00:22:57,170 --> 00:23:02,960
where we're gonna have really strong

599
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:05,240
strains that are certified for CBD

600
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:09,380
production and extraction I really hope

601
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:10,640
so and yeah with you know with the way

602
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:12,740
that the industry is going I think

603
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,240
there's a lot of potential for that to

604
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:16,519
take place and now that they're letting

605
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:18,170
us do this legally you know there's

606
00:23:16,519 --> 00:23:19,819
going to be a lot more closeted

607
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:22,430
scientists and people that want to

608
00:23:19,819 --> 00:23:24,859
experiment and learn and really you know

609
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:28,400
figure this out and figure out what the

610
00:23:24,859 --> 00:23:30,979
best way is to utilize this resource for

611
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,660
our future going forward and I think

612
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:35,569
it's a beautiful thing and I think we

613
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:37,550
will definitely see that from companies

614
00:23:35,569 --> 00:23:39,470
here in the next couple years they're

615
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:41,720
gonna start coming out with products

616
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:43,860
that are superior to others or what is

617
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:46,930
the current status quo

618
00:23:43,859 --> 00:23:49,259
CBD or THC a bigger market in the next

619
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:49,259
five years

620
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:56,560
CBD you think so for the next five years

621
00:23:53,829 --> 00:23:58,480
I think everyone's trying to hop on that

622
00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:01,450
train right now and get involved with it

623
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:03,819
in one way or the other but you know for

624
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:05,950
our industry obviously THC is the game

625
00:24:03,819 --> 00:24:07,599
and I think there's a spot for those two

626
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:09,009
circles to overlap in the middle and

627
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:11,559
there's going to be a huge market that's

628
00:24:09,009 --> 00:24:13,450
interested in finding that that golden

629
00:24:11,559 --> 00:24:14,740
ratio you know that one to one where

630
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:16,750
they're really getting the relief that

631
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:18,819
they need from the products that they're

632
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:20,349
consuming you know I used to send this

633
00:24:18,819 --> 00:24:23,529
law and I think I still believe this

634
00:24:20,349 --> 00:24:25,719
there's this THC customer base market

635
00:24:23,529 --> 00:24:28,029
and it's not going anywhere and it's

636
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:31,450
huge yeah but then there's this CBD

637
00:24:28,029 --> 00:24:33,190
market that might encompass everyone

638
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:35,830
else on earth that might not necessarily

639
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:39,430
be interested in the THC aspects of

640
00:24:35,829 --> 00:24:40,569
cannabis but the CBD aspects are way

641
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:42,580
even for your pets

642
00:24:40,569 --> 00:24:44,619
the healing aspects it's incredible th

643
00:24:42,579 --> 00:24:46,210
she's a part of that but it's not as

644
00:24:44,619 --> 00:24:49,059
much as a psychoactive as it is a

645
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:50,650
activator component where we know we

646
00:24:49,059 --> 00:24:53,109
need a little bit of THC I think that's

647
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:56,430
right that's what we all think yeah have

648
00:24:53,109 --> 00:24:59,829
had a little activation in there yeah

649
00:24:56,430 --> 00:25:02,350
Auto flower is

650
00:24:59,829 --> 00:25:05,319
is coming into the US market are you

651
00:25:02,349 --> 00:25:07,179
guys breeding any auto flower strains or

652
00:25:05,319 --> 00:25:10,079
this great song

653
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:13,779
we're staying away from ruderalis we're

654
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:16,059
yeah we're we said we weren't gonna do

655
00:25:13,779 --> 00:25:17,889
feminized and we're finishing a

656
00:25:16,059 --> 00:25:21,700
feminized project right now actually

657
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:23,470
we're doing one to one CBD THC cross

658
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:25,720
with mousse cookies that was bred by

659
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:28,329
light sky farms and we're crossing that

660
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:30,640
to a lot of our strains and mothers that

661
00:25:28,329 --> 00:25:32,919
have you know proven themselves to us

662
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,630
over the years so we're excited about

663
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:37,480
that and that line will be released and

664
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:39,040
probably about five to six months you

665
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:40,809
know we've got testing and stuff like

666
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:43,149
that to finish up and checking in with

667
00:25:40,809 --> 00:25:44,289
people and you know putting our brains

668
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:46,390
together and being like alright let's

669
00:25:44,289 --> 00:25:53,710
look at the data on this how's it

670
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:55,570
looking but that is something where you

671
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:56,890
know people want the Otto flowers to

672
00:25:55,569 --> 00:25:59,139
they don't want to mess with the time

673
00:25:56,890 --> 00:26:00,670
change people want it easy and so some

674
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:02,200
aren't willing to do the work and some

675
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:03,940
are and I think the ones that are

676
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:05,740
willing to do the work and really put in

677
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:07,029
the time to get to know their plants and

678
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:08,710
the genetics that they're working with

679
00:26:07,029 --> 00:26:10,539
they're going to be the ones you know

680
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:13,840
reaping those benefits a little bit more

681
00:26:10,539 --> 00:26:15,490
in the end in terms of quality yields

682
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:18,309
and just overall performance of their

683
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:19,240
plants seems like the Otto flower a

684
00:26:18,309 --> 00:26:21,490
phenom

685
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:23,529
phenomenon in Europe has been very

686
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:25,599
strong yeah that's actually starting to

687
00:26:23,529 --> 00:26:27,700
fade away where people are realizing

688
00:26:25,599 --> 00:26:29,799
they want the non ruderalis version of

689
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:31,269
cannabis and so I see that with a lot of

690
00:26:29,799 --> 00:26:33,279
the people that I work with over there

691
00:26:31,269 --> 00:26:34,720
and it's funny to see this drifting and

692
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:37,599
here something that's kind of fading out

693
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:39,269
of Europe thinking that the United

694
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:42,359
States non versions cooler and

695
00:26:39,269 --> 00:26:45,509
the US is adopting some of it right and

696
00:26:42,359 --> 00:26:47,159
I think no matter what I've heard people

697
00:26:45,509 --> 00:26:48,599
that grow out of flower there's

698
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:50,370
something about the ruderalis that you

699
00:26:48,599 --> 00:26:52,349
can sense across all the autoflowering

700
00:26:50,369 --> 00:26:54,299
strains it kind of ties it together it

701
00:26:52,349 --> 00:26:57,029
makes sense but it might not be as

702
00:26:54,299 --> 00:26:58,559
desirable for some people it's become

703
00:26:57,029 --> 00:27:01,049
the feedback I've got and I think yeah

704
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:02,669
just yet what you said and it just comes

705
00:27:01,049 --> 00:27:04,919
down to what you're growing style is you

706
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:06,900
know what works for you how much time do

707
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:09,420
you have to devote to looking at them

708
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:11,370
every day and watering them and you know

709
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:15,170
what yeah what product are you looking

710
00:27:11,369 --> 00:27:15,169
for at the end of it all - so
