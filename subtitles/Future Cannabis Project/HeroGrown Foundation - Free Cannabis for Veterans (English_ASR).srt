1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:12,580
you

2
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:12,580
[Music]

3
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:19,690
well here a grown foundation yes

4
00:00:17,949 --> 00:00:21,278
how'd you start it when did it start

5
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:23,500
what's give me the fourth actually I

6
00:00:21,278 --> 00:00:25,719
actually started giving free cannabis to

7
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:28,809
veterans in 2010 when I lived in Lake

8
00:00:25,719 --> 00:00:33,570
Tahoe after cannabis saved my life and

9
00:00:28,809 --> 00:00:38,679
then I really hero grown was born early

10
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:41,679
2014 so it's a charity that gathers

11
00:00:38,679 --> 00:00:43,450
cannabis and gathers and and goodwill

12
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:46,719
for veterans and first responders that's

13
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:50,160
the absolutely and we have cultivators

14
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:52,269
that donate product to us we have CBD

15
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:55,569
manufacturers who donate product to us

16
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:59,140
also so and the throwers literally gift

17
00:00:55,570 --> 00:01:02,920
you cannabis product whether it's flour

18
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:04,269
or oil or anything that's going to have

19
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:06,460
a therapeutic value for a veteran

20
00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:07,930
absolutely and sometimes it even comes

21
00:01:06,459 --> 00:01:10,868
through dispensaries you know where they

22
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:13,689
do in most states they can do that for a

23
00:01:10,868 --> 00:01:16,989
penny you know and transfer it just

24
00:01:13,688 --> 00:01:20,019
because satisfy the tax the taxman

25
00:01:16,989 --> 00:01:21,879
so that's awesome so the vet but your

26
00:01:20,019 --> 00:01:24,609
personal experiences with as a veteran

27
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:26,799
so and with issues that were caused by

28
00:01:24,609 --> 00:01:28,989
your work sure so is that what caused

29
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:33,728
you to get into it now really what the

30
00:01:28,989 --> 00:01:35,739
the genesis for hero grown was in 2013 I

31
00:01:33,728 --> 00:01:38,739
was training my German Shepherd who was

32
00:01:35,739 --> 00:01:40,929
a young pup at the time and I rented all

33
00:01:38,739 --> 00:01:42,579
these young vets who were telling me

34
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:44,860
they were taking 20 or 25 different

35
00:01:42,579 --> 00:01:46,269
prescription meds a day and that

36
00:01:44,859 --> 00:01:49,689
cannabis was the only thing that ever

37
00:01:46,269 --> 00:01:52,449
help them with PTSD pain depression

38
00:01:49,689 --> 00:01:54,189
anxiety but if they wanted to buy their

39
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:56,380
kid a new backpack to start school next

40
00:01:54,189 --> 00:01:59,228
week they couldn't afford to buy the

41
00:01:56,379 --> 00:02:01,359
cannabis so one morning shortly after

42
00:01:59,228 --> 00:02:03,069
that I woke up and decided that's just

43
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:05,290
outrageous the only reason they're

44
00:02:03,069 --> 00:02:07,478
taking these pills that kill over 50

45
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:10,688
vets a day now is because they were free

46
00:02:07,478 --> 00:02:12,370
how much how big of a problem is opiate

47
00:02:10,688 --> 00:02:14,530
addiction with with that's it's

48
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:16,870
horrendous I mean it's a you know it's a

49
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:20,259
it's it's getting a little bit better in

50
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:21,819
terms of the prescribing of it but you

51
00:02:20,259 --> 00:02:24,068
know is just pretty much just always a

52
00:02:21,818 --> 00:02:26,589
standard answer not just not just

53
00:02:24,068 --> 00:02:27,909
opiates but a wide variety of

54
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:30,159
pharmaceuticals and

55
00:02:27,909 --> 00:02:32,889
it's widely understood now that cannabis

56
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:35,680
therapies are a way to an alternative

57
00:02:32,889 --> 00:02:37,869
way to get off of opiates is that

58
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,189
perhaps you know I really believe that's

59
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:41,950
the case you know when I talked to

60
00:02:39,189 --> 00:02:43,870
providers at the VA now you know the

61
00:02:41,949 --> 00:02:46,899
providers at that level are much more

62
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:48,640
receptive to to having their patients

63
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:50,200
use cannabis you know the the

64
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:51,639
bureaucrats are the ones that are that

65
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:53,619
are holding it up because the

66
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:56,139
politicians of course you know pull the

67
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:57,640
strings there so you know that's what we

68
00:02:56,139 --> 00:02:59,799
really have to get to you know the

69
00:02:57,639 --> 00:03:01,839
driving force behind this simply's money

70
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,910
you know Big Pharma gives you know

71
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,310
millions adopt billions of dollars to

72
00:03:03,909 --> 00:03:08,139
you know to politicians and then that

73
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:09,670
kind of trickles downhill when they're

74
00:03:08,139 --> 00:03:12,189
appointing someone to be the head of the

75
00:03:09,669 --> 00:03:14,049
VA hospital or whatever and so the

76
00:03:12,189 --> 00:03:16,180
bureaucrats are still pretty stubborn

77
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:17,800
when it comes to cannabis so here a

78
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:20,650
growing foundation operates in how many

79
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:23,350
states what we operate nationally now we

80
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:24,909
you know only give away free cannabis in

81
00:03:23,349 --> 00:03:28,060
states where it's legal to do that

82
00:03:24,909 --> 00:03:29,620
obviously but we ship free CBD products

83
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:32,140
to veterans and first responders in all

84
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:34,900
50 states now about forty thousand forty

85
00:03:32,139 --> 00:03:36,939
to sixty thousand dollars a month in CBD

86
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:39,700
products and we've given away over four

87
00:03:36,939 --> 00:03:41,560
million dollars in in actual cannabis

88
00:03:39,699 --> 00:03:43,959
products in the last five years that's

89
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:46,210
awesome so each state has different

90
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:48,520
regulations about cannabis and cannabis

91
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:50,080
products so how do you function I can

92
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,820
how would you function in Marylander how

93
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,490
would you function in New Jersey well in

94
00:03:51,819 --> 00:03:56,079
it back east primarily the way we

95
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:59,170
function are through veterans who are

96
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,610
members of our organization and it's

97
00:03:59,169 --> 00:04:03,849
kind of like an underground railroad

98
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:05,380
deal if you will you know and they take

99
00:04:03,849 --> 00:04:07,689
care of other veterans they take you

100
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:09,819
know we facilitate with our contacts

101
00:04:07,689 --> 00:04:12,370
donations and again it's not always a

102
00:04:09,819 --> 00:04:14,949
you know licensed cultivator sometimes

103
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:16,629
it's a private grower or whatever we

104
00:04:14,949 --> 00:04:19,269
test everything before we give it out

105
00:04:16,629 --> 00:04:21,279
but in a lot of those eastern states

106
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:23,649
still you know we don't do public

107
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:25,899
giveaway events you know we have

108
00:04:23,649 --> 00:04:27,279
veterans helping other veterans so

109
00:04:25,899 --> 00:04:29,109
there's two ends of the pipe line you've

110
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:31,529
got logistics at the one end where you

111
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:33,939
have producers that are getting

112
00:04:31,529 --> 00:04:35,859
different products into your hands to be

113
00:04:33,939 --> 00:04:37,959
distributed to veterans in a particular

114
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:39,740
location and then the other end of the

115
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:43,180
funnel is your network

116
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:45,110
of veterans that are connected to the

117
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:47,389
neighborhood that they're in the

118
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:51,139
locality that they reside in and they're

119
00:04:47,389 --> 00:04:52,879
bringing the relief to the relief that

120
00:04:51,139 --> 00:04:54,529
you find people can also make cash

121
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:57,639
donations I'm sure at a website

122
00:04:54,529 --> 00:05:01,939
absolutely yeah just at Hero grown org

123
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:03,949
orgy they can make donations and you

124
00:05:01,939 --> 00:05:05,810
know that that helps a great deal

125
00:05:03,949 --> 00:05:08,240
especially with with hero grow and

126
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:10,220
airdrop which is our national program

127
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,650
where we ship as I said free CBD

128
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:14,750
products to vets and first responders in

129
00:05:12,649 --> 00:05:17,120
all 50 states it's very expensive so you

130
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:21,110
bring the first responders in New York

131
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:24,170
around the 9/11 attacks the this first

132
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:25,699
responder trauma was such a elevated

133
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:27,379
thing that people had an understanding

134
00:05:25,699 --> 00:05:29,629
of you changed the name of the

135
00:05:27,379 --> 00:05:32,149
foundation from grow for vets to hero

136
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:33,560
grown to include first responders can

137
00:05:32,149 --> 00:05:34,969
you talk about that and what the impacts

138
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,829
been and sure well you know in addition

139
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:41,060
to being an Army veteran I also had a

140
00:05:36,829 --> 00:05:43,310
background in law enforcement and it

141
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:44,089
wasn't the the shootings that we had in

142
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:49,490
Las Vegas

143
00:05:44,089 --> 00:05:51,560
okay October of 2017 it wasn't really a

144
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:54,290
driving force I'd already decided that

145
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:57,350
we'd include include first responders

146
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:59,569
but that certainly accelerated you know

147
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:02,420
the process and consequently on January

148
00:05:59,569 --> 00:06:04,759
1st night of 2018 we transitioned or

149
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:06,410
evolve from grow for vets USA to hero

150
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:08,269
grown and started helping first

151
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:10,760
responders we'd helped a lot of first

152
00:06:08,269 --> 00:06:12,549
responders prior to that but we really

153
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:14,539
didn't make a big deal out of it or

154
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:16,310
publicize the fact that we were doing

155
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:18,170
that you know but I've been helping

156
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:21,740
first responders in Lake Tahoe since

157
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:24,110
2010 so when I lived there so you know

158
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:26,449
in a lot of a lot of jurisdictions now

159
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:28,520
for example you know one of the the

160
00:06:26,449 --> 00:06:32,240
people the persons that we help in Lake

161
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:34,370
Tahoe is an EMT and you know the his

162
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,889
chief is fine with him using cannabis

163
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:38,629
you know but if he does uses cannabis

164
00:06:36,889 --> 00:06:41,149
like the night before he tells his cheap

165
00:06:38,629 --> 00:06:42,889
or his captain I mean and then he he

166
00:06:41,149 --> 00:06:45,500
just doesn't drive the you know the rig

167
00:06:42,889 --> 00:06:47,120
that day but other than that I mean you

168
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:49,089
they understand these guys get a lot of

169
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,649
injuries a lot of physical injuries but

170
00:06:49,089 --> 00:06:54,259
again like you mentioned you know in New

171
00:06:51,649 --> 00:06:56,750
York or shootings here in Vegas

172
00:06:54,259 --> 00:06:58,519
you know I mean it's just but the trauma

173
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:00,709
those guys went through is horrendous

174
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:02,149
and it's not just the first responders I

175
00:07:00,709 --> 00:07:04,399
mean the people that were you know

176
00:07:02,149 --> 00:07:06,949
affected thousands of civilians

177
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:08,120
post-traumatic stress only 30 percent of

178
00:07:06,949 --> 00:07:10,639
the people in the United States we have

179
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:13,430
post-traumatic stress for veterans so

180
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,569
you know you can have PTSD you know if

181
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:17,090
you've been involved in any traumatic

182
00:07:14,569 --> 00:07:19,219
situation in your life really appreciate

183
00:07:17,089 --> 00:07:22,369

00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:37,970
to the beginning you know we couldn't do

191
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:40,760
what we do without your help and I

192
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:42,800

Bovada team so well we appreciate you

00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,930
thanks Roger

195
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:47,960
I mean this is this is a this is a

196
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:50,660
conversation about where you get into

197
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:53,419
the gray area on all the legalities and

198
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:56,540
all of the logistics of picking up

199
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:58,550
product I mean you told me a story about

200
00:07:56,540 --> 00:08:01,370
being in Colorado and and being able to

201
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:03,290
drive up to a dispensary and have them

202
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:06,230
give you a significant amount of product

203
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:08,090
certainly so are you it are you at risk

204
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:10,850
I mean how should a politician feel if

205
00:08:08,089 --> 00:08:13,399
they're watching this clip about hero

206
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:15,410
grown and trying to understand all the

207
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:17,329
good that you're doing for veterans and

208
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:19,880
what are some of the hassles that you

209
00:08:17,329 --> 00:08:22,129
run into or some of the the liability

210
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:23,839
that you could face because of these

211
00:08:22,129 --> 00:08:25,670
restrictions in different territories

212
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:27,379
well we've been very fortunate we've

213
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:30,350
never had any incidents with law

214
00:08:27,379 --> 00:08:31,730
enforcement you know knock on wood it

215
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:33,620
helps that your former launch well I

216
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:35,990
don't I don't know that that's I think

217
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:38,149
it helps for example in Colorado where

218
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:39,979
we were well established where law

219
00:08:38,149 --> 00:08:41,750
enforcement knew what we were doing they

220
00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:44,509
knew who we were they knew we weren't

221
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:46,429
taking you know product and Nebraska

222
00:08:44,509 --> 00:08:48,409
where I grew up or Kansas or something

223
00:08:46,429 --> 00:08:51,019
like that doing you know trafficking

224
00:08:48,409 --> 00:08:53,149
Canada exactly yeah exactly so you know

225
00:08:51,019 --> 00:08:55,699
I think that you know and in the the in

226
00:08:53,149 --> 00:08:57,199
Colorado the process or the it's been

227
00:08:55,700 --> 00:09:00,890
legal for so long now

228
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:02,780
that for five years that you know

229
00:09:00,889 --> 00:09:04,429
they're pretty much you know it's just

230
00:09:02,779 --> 00:09:05,879
more open for example that it is in

231
00:09:04,429 --> 00:09:08,519
Nevada where I live now

232
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:10,470
you know in Nevada you know all of the

233
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:12,299
owners the licensees are very very

234
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:14,700
concerned about losing their license if

235
00:09:12,299 --> 00:09:16,469
they you know thought of compliance with

236
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:19,320
the rules exactly you know and some of

237
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:21,120
the rules here are really otic like most

238
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:24,090
states the rules were made by people who

239
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,440
knew nothing about cannabis right so you

240
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:28,139
know for example we get a lot of

241
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:31,350
donations from California people that

242
00:09:28,139 --> 00:09:33,659
live in California I don't ask them how

243
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:36,570
it came how the cannabis say donate got

244
00:09:33,659 --> 00:09:40,289
the Nevada but I'm sure that it didn't

245
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:42,420
just appear in Nevada so you know I mean

246
00:09:40,289 --> 00:09:44,579
there there are some times where you

247
00:09:42,419 --> 00:09:47,789
know we really do our best and I do my

248
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:49,290
best not to do anything illegal but

249
00:09:47,789 --> 00:09:51,389
there are times for example we're having

250
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:53,339
giveaway events where certainly I'm in

251
00:09:51,389 --> 00:09:55,259
possession of more than what the legal

252
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:57,420
limit is because I'm taking it to

253
00:09:55,259 --> 00:10:01,200
distribute right no tens or hundreds of

254
00:09:57,419 --> 00:10:02,819
veterans and so I do that myself because

255
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,950
I don't want to put someone else at risk

256
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:06,870
great and again we've never had an

257
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:09,270
incident with law enforcement again I

258
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:11,220
they know what we're doing with it you

259
00:10:09,269 --> 00:10:13,439
know I think here even by now so let me

260
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:16,110
go a different direction with this you I

261
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,540
had a dear friend explained to me that

262
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:21,120
he felt sincerely that California had

263
00:10:18,539 --> 00:10:24,299
sold its soul in the cannabis business

264
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:26,909
because his whole premise was used to be

265
00:10:24,299 --> 00:10:29,009
patient focused that everything was

266
00:10:26,909 --> 00:10:30,539
about the serving the patient it's

267
00:10:29,009 --> 00:10:33,750
similar because what you're doing with

268
00:10:30,539 --> 00:10:37,169
veterans and and first responders is

269
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:39,899
about you know medicine for what ails

270
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:42,750
you but the comment was made that

271
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:44,429
California had sold its soul from a

272
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:46,320
regulatory perspective and from a

273
00:10:44,429 --> 00:10:48,149
commercial perspective because the

274
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,400
patient was no longer the center of it

275
00:10:48,149 --> 00:10:53,759
well in that I think that's happened in

276
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:55,559
every state you know certainly in states

277
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:57,600
where they had medical first and then

278
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:59,939
they transitioned into what they call

279
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:03,690
recreational cannabis which is one of

280
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:05,280
the stupidest terms to recreational

281
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:10,170
alcohol or so it sounds like it's going

282
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:12,779
to be an Olympic sport so the in

283
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:14,879
Colorado we talk about we talk about the

284
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:16,860
regulator's we talk they call it Green

285
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:18,389
crack they're all about the green crack

286
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:19,129
that's all they care about the money it

287
00:11:18,389 --> 00:11:20,600
generates

288
00:11:19,129 --> 00:11:22,879
creates more jobs for their

289
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:25,490
infrastructure that's that's forever

290
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:28,580
growing where they can hire more people

291
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:29,930
to do it supposedly do enforcement you

292
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:32,150
know Colorado is a pretty good example

293
00:11:29,929 --> 00:11:34,969
of how silly it is the marijuana

294
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:36,889
Enforcement Division they're you know

295
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:38,810
they're they're their business cards

296
00:11:36,889 --> 00:11:40,699
indicate that they are that they're

297
00:11:38,809 --> 00:11:43,099
investigators you know they carry guns

298
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:44,690
of all nine yards but if you go in there

299
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:46,670
and and and tell them you know about

300
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:48,680
some illegal activity that's going on

301
00:11:46,669 --> 00:11:50,599
they refer that the local law

302
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:52,489
enforcement they don't do investigations

303
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,470
so I mean it's it's pretty stupid the

304
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:57,259
way they the whole system set up so the

305
00:11:54,470 --> 00:12:00,259
whole sole selling subject the reason

306
00:11:57,259 --> 00:12:01,580
why I bring it up is because there's

307
00:12:00,259 --> 00:12:03,110
redemption in life I mean I think

308
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:05,690
everybody would agree there's there's

309
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:08,000
two sides to everything so if we have

310
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:10,280
collectively sold our souls and taken

311
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,830
our focus off what's good for the

312
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:16,309
patient there's also an opportunity to

313
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:19,340
perhaps buy our souls back right what do

314
00:12:16,309 --> 00:12:22,009
you think about and and I think this is

315
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:23,990
germane to what you're doing because if

316
00:12:22,009 --> 00:12:28,970
patients that were terminally ill had

317
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:31,730
access to cannabis at no charge that

318
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:34,009
would really go a long way to buy our

319
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:35,720
souls back absolutely apps and and and

320
00:12:34,009 --> 00:12:37,970
the same thing applies to veterans I

321
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:40,070
mean or really anyone that can't get

322
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:41,930
exactly what they need you know and in

323
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:45,530
Nevada is a really good example too of

324
00:12:41,929 --> 00:12:47,750
what can go back go really bad you know

325
00:12:45,529 --> 00:12:52,069
when Nevada first went recreationally

326
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:54,019
legal it really the way they set the

327
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:56,390
system up it really shut out a lot of

328
00:12:54,019 --> 00:12:58,909
patients and so there were patients who

329
00:12:56,389 --> 00:13:00,889
couldn't get medicine okay that had been

330
00:12:58,909 --> 00:13:04,069
getting medicine for quite some time you

331
00:13:00,889 --> 00:13:07,819
know prior to the recreational you know

332
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:09,710
going legal so I mean it they don't

333
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:11,360
think about that you know the the

334
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:13,550
regulators don't think again they know

335
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:16,009
nothing to by the regulators defense

336
00:13:13,549 --> 00:13:17,449
they have the best intention I mean

337
00:13:16,009 --> 00:13:19,429
they're not out there trying to ruin

338
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:20,840
somebody's process they're trying to

339
00:13:19,429 --> 00:13:23,449
make rules about something that they may

340
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:25,129
not as you had alluded to they may not

341
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:27,259
personally understand it at a level I

342
00:13:25,129 --> 00:13:28,730
mean if we had growers that we're

343
00:13:27,259 --> 00:13:30,470
figuring out how to create regulations

344
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:32,480
for growers I think we'd have a lot

345
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:34,340
better regulations there's comments

346
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,740
you know and and and by and large what

347
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:37,850
you say is true but on the other hand I

348
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:39,200
have to tell you that you know I'm

349
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:41,389
pretty well convinced there are some

350
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:43,129
states where you know the enforcement

351
00:13:41,389 --> 00:13:44,870
people sit around a you know a round

352
00:13:43,129 --> 00:13:47,090
table every morning trying to figure out

353
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:49,340
what they can do to you know the hassle

354
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:51,110
the people that are in the industry you

355
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:52,399
know which is pretty idiotic because you

356
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:54,080
know it's almost like they're trying to

357
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:56,389
they don't understand that if they shut

358
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:58,040
it down they're gonna lose their they're

359
00:13:56,389 --> 00:14:00,139
gonna eliminate their own jobs do you

360
00:13:58,039 --> 00:14:03,319
have access or has this been considered

361
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:05,330
to for seized or forfeited property can

362
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:07,280
you get your hands on cannabis that's

363
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:09,290
been seized by law enforcement and

364
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:10,819
redistribute it to you know that's

365
00:14:09,289 --> 00:14:12,379
something that there were that we

366
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:14,810
they're getting ready to try to do

367
00:14:12,379 --> 00:14:16,789
before that we treat for example in

368
00:14:14,809 --> 00:14:18,799
Nevada a lot of people tourists would

369
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:20,629
buy cannabis and then they'd have to

370
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:22,579
throw it away or give it away or

371
00:14:20,629 --> 00:14:24,649
whatever it's a lot of times the rental

372
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:25,670
car companies a couple years ago when

373
00:14:24,649 --> 00:14:27,319
the first went League or thought about

374
00:14:25,669 --> 00:14:29,659
they had all this stuff left in rental

375
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:31,070
vehicles you know so I tried to get away

376
00:14:29,659 --> 00:14:32,480
to if people didn't want to take it home

377
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:34,640
with them well yeah exactly they want to

378
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,289
cut because please understand TSA is not

379
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:38,659
a Drug Enforcement Agency

380
00:14:36,289 --> 00:14:40,759
you know I carry cannabis Mike cannabis

381
00:14:38,659 --> 00:14:43,339
medicine am i carry on every time I fly

382
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:45,409
I've had it in my carry-on and I opened

383
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:47,600
it up and TSA has gone through it and

384
00:14:45,409 --> 00:14:49,339
they've never touched my my cannabis at

385
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,529
all I'm sure if you had you know five

386
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:53,629
pounds or something in your suitcase

387
00:14:51,529 --> 00:14:55,669
they'd call the police or something but

388
00:14:53,629 --> 00:14:58,759
that's not their job they're looking for

389
00:14:55,669 --> 00:15:01,339
explosives so that's all the repurposing

390
00:14:58,759 --> 00:15:03,439
of instead of destroying it there sue

391
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:06,830
there's got to be a value or an

392
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:08,930
opportunity for us to take that cannabis

393
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:11,600
that's for whatever reason been seized

394
00:15:08,929 --> 00:15:14,359
and to put it back to good use for the

395
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:16,399
relief of pain and trauma for veterans

396
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:17,750
and first responders well and and that's

397
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:19,100
absolutely true you know and that's

398
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:21,320
something that really you know we

399
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:23,149
probably need to work hard because $0.20

400
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:26,360
well that's that's one reason that's the

401
00:15:23,149 --> 00:15:28,699
main thing that holds it up yeah it's

402
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:31,190
too logical drew so the future for hero

403
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:32,629
grown dark what's the future what are

404
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:34,610
your plans where are you going

405
00:15:32,629 --> 00:15:37,029
well you know again we're growing

406
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:39,139
membership you know very very rapidly

407
00:15:37,029 --> 00:15:41,029
you know and so our hope is just to

408
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:43,159
continue what we're doing but to touch

409
00:15:41,029 --> 00:15:44,720
more lives you know the last thing I

410
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:45,949
think about every night before I fall

411
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,200
asleep is you know 50

412
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:49,700
more veterans and first responders died

413
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:52,790
today and you know what could I have

414
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:55,460
done to you know do a better job to save

415
00:15:52,789 --> 00:15:57,199
some of them so you know that that's the

416
00:15:55,460 --> 00:16:00,320
mission we're on now you know really our

417
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:02,240
goal is to to have veterans and and

418
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,970

419
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,830
access to free cannabis the same way

420
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:08,750
they have safe access to the drugs that

421
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:11,240
are killing you know so many people you

422
