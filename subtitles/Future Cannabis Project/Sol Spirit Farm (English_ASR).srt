1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:20,699
go down the line so so right here we got

2
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:23,640
some Clementine which great even though

3
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:27,118
really high Mersin it's still a sativa

4
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,528
and keeps you going and focused with

5
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:31,589
really great pain relief with that

6
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:33,689
that's the climate time right there well

7
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:36,750
I mean we we've been growing these

8
00:00:33,689 --> 00:00:39,299
strains just this one season trying

9
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:41,969
things out we're chilling we've switched

10
00:00:39,299 --> 00:00:43,890
up our switched up our way to do these

11
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:46,800
things we're getting them from some of

12
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:49,920
the local legal nurseries

13
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:53,038
this year we're running hendrix stuff

14
00:00:49,920 --> 00:01:01,770
we're running mother's know Charlie's

15
00:00:53,039 --> 00:01:03,570
girl we run in blueberry muffin and so

16
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:05,338
do you kind of like pick what you're

17
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:07,530
gonna do next season based on what's

18
00:01:05,338 --> 00:01:09,359
available or what you think the markets

19
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:11,159
gonna be interested in right well they

20
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:13,170
it's the kind of combination of what

21
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:15,780
what the markets gonna be interested in

22
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:18,359
we do know currently we need to hit

23
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:21,868
those high THC numbers to make sure that

24
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:25,349
it's easy to sell it's a silly game and

25
00:01:21,868 --> 00:01:27,629
not really how I pick my own weed but it

26
00:01:25,349 --> 00:01:30,509
is how I have to sell it Todd talk about

27
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:32,109
what you like to smoke oh it would be on

28
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:36,530
this table of

29
00:01:32,109 --> 00:01:40,219
listen to you I mean we grow this wigger

30
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:42,469
this amazing Colombian gold Oaxacan gold

31
00:01:40,219 --> 00:01:44,060
cross a couple years ago I want to get

32
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:45,950
that going again it was called savage

33
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:47,659
I'm here tonight I don't have any of

34
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:50,930
that here today no that was some really

35
00:01:47,659 --> 00:01:52,640
great sativa but you know I like smoking

36
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:55,100
against sativa is mainly for the most

37
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:58,760
early half of the day so that I can

38
00:01:55,099 --> 00:02:00,769
focus and work and so that Clementine

39
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:04,368
it's a great job with that and then this

40
00:02:00,769 --> 00:02:07,340
Sour Diesel here that's really you know

41
00:02:04,368 --> 00:02:11,900
nice focused and a totally different

42
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:16,840
flavor spectrum then they been the

43
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:22,069
Clementine was still good focus energy

44
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:24,020
how we were the entire visited with the

45
00:02:22,069 --> 00:02:28,370
names pretty fresh and these are from

46
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:31,939
last you know September is the latest

47
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:34,849
you know so they you know they're not

48
00:02:31,939 --> 00:02:36,259
super super fresh but they're at their

49
00:02:34,849 --> 00:02:37,819
peak there's still you know they're

50
00:02:36,259 --> 00:02:41,030
testing at twenty five percent twenty

51
00:02:37,819 --> 00:02:42,949
four percent so just quickly talk about

52
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:44,509
what we were talking about before where

53
00:02:42,949 --> 00:02:47,060
you're growing and why having

54
00:02:44,509 --> 00:02:48,709
greenhouses like what having greenhouses

55
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:51,229
now allows you to do that you couldn't

56
00:02:48,709 --> 00:02:53,860
do before right well so currently we're

57
00:02:51,229 --> 00:02:56,419
using the light deprivation so we came

58
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:58,760
once the Sun Goes Down off the hill

59
00:02:56,419 --> 00:03:01,099
we pulled tarps down over over the

60
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:03,769
plants and makes them thinks at

61
00:03:01,099 --> 00:03:05,239
nighttime and that's the thing that like

62
00:03:03,769 --> 00:03:07,219
an indoor scene you can have multiple

63
00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:12,439
harvests through the year and we can

64
00:03:07,219 --> 00:03:14,689
also bring it in early and before the

65
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:17,389
rains come and so then that gives us a

66
00:03:14,689 --> 00:03:19,340
chance to use a microscope and really

67
00:03:17,389 --> 00:03:20,279
live the trichomes and figure out where

68
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:22,310
you know

69
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,960
when they're at their most peak

70
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:28,710
perfection and bring it in that way

71
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:30,990
versus harvesting one versus raining you

72
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:33,990
know being like okay this is starting to

73
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:37,409
mold and this is gonna mold now so okay

74
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:39,870
it's time to harvest it and I did that

75
00:03:37,409 --> 00:03:42,209
for a long time so you've reduced your

76
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:44,550
mold problem oh definitely really you

77
00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:46,560
know in and we're really you know we're

78
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:49,290
we're getting on it now we're we're

79
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:52,259
inner planting other crops in there

80
00:03:49,289 --> 00:03:54,689
we're talking about what crumber crops

81
00:03:52,259 --> 00:03:56,609
here you dig each week well I mean we've

82
00:03:54,689 --> 00:03:58,680
really been liking this clover we've

83
00:03:56,610 --> 00:04:01,590
been growing it's a perennial clover and

84
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:04,200
but it's growing underneath the ganja

85
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:07,770
and so we can take and harvest that

86
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:10,589
feeds the soil mulch is everything out

87
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:12,540
we don't have to bring in any straw or

88
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:14,789
anything that's where's that coming from

89
00:04:12,539 --> 00:04:17,668
does it have pesticides on it is it

90
00:04:14,789 --> 00:04:19,079
gonna mess up you know our product so

91
00:04:17,668 --> 00:04:22,319
it's just closing those loops and

92
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:23,970
keeping everything from on-site and that

93
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:26,610
yeah a perennial clover is definitely

94
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:28,110
part of that it breaks up pathogens and

95
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:31,710
all that because they don't it's just

96
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:33,300
not straight one type of plant we're

97
00:04:31,709 --> 00:04:35,489
breaking that up there's the other types

98
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:40,020
of plant house raised beds or as a

99
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:42,990
sponsor it's not raised beds it's yeah

100
00:04:40,019 --> 00:04:45,359
we're a little bit of a hill and so

101
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:47,819
they're across the the hill in a contour

102
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:58,050
fashion whether you're in the ground in

103
00:04:47,819 --> 00:04:59,089
the ground oh cool awesome we visit up

104
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:01,850
in that area there

105
00:04:59,089 --> 00:05:05,209
we're in the ground and we make

106
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:07,330
researching one another we're we've been

107
00:05:05,209 --> 00:05:10,069
nurturing this soil it's a its no-till

108
00:05:07,329 --> 00:05:13,069
it's all like I said there's that

109
00:05:10,069 --> 00:05:16,069
perennial cover crop growing in in their

110
00:05:13,069 --> 00:05:20,810
bed in our beds and so we just take and

111
00:05:16,069 --> 00:05:22,610
replant in those same spots again we

112
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:23,780
have four greenhouses actually how many

113
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:30,430
oh Anthony

114
00:05:23,779 --> 00:05:35,329
so it's 900 plants in each right

115
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:36,620
sorry 450 all right for 450 450 plants

116
00:05:35,329 --> 00:05:39,709
in each green so you have generally

117
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:42,829
about 1,800 plants right per run and I

118
00:05:39,709 --> 00:05:46,549
do two runs a while where this the both

119
00:05:42,829 --> 00:05:47,959
runs around but yeah and that way it

120
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:51,079
gives us chance to have eight different

121
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:54,889
strains really easily and keep them all

122
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:57,259
separate and clean and and use onyx

123
00:05:54,889 --> 00:05:59,689
about reading and developing a strain

124
00:05:57,259 --> 00:06:02,329
that you guys want to be known for is

125
00:05:59,689 --> 00:06:03,860
that you know that's in the long term

126
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:06,800
we're definitely we're gonna be planting

127
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:09,259
some different different plants it's

128
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:12,280
always interesting to see that how

129
00:06:09,259 --> 00:06:15,319
something does in the in this greenhouse

130
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:19,250
situation versus what we used to do the

131
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:22,849
full long-term plant we grow those big

132
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:24,920
monster plants this is this is a whole

133
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:26,629
different game now I have a question for

134
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,379
you said you're in between Humboldt and

135
00:06:26,629 --> 00:06:29,449
tree

136
00:06:27,379 --> 00:06:30,740
yeah we're in Trinity talk about Trinity

137
00:06:29,449 --> 00:06:32,479
a little bit because you know we don't

138
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:34,340
really hear you know it's treated it's

139
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:36,950
the Forgotten emerald that's what I know

140
00:06:34,339 --> 00:06:39,259
totally you know it is the Emerald

141
00:06:36,949 --> 00:06:41,509
triangle it is some of the really ideal

142
00:06:39,259 --> 00:06:43,639
and there's just not as many folks out

143
00:06:41,509 --> 00:06:46,399
in the Trinity and so that we kind of

144
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:48,319
get lost on the on the way side on that

145
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:50,959
but is it a tight community none the

146
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:53,659
Hoff well so we're actually in the

147
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:57,069
Humboldt community we're right there on

148
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:59,180
that border like I say so yeah we have

149
00:06:57,069 --> 00:07:01,219
we have a lot of friends that are in

150
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:05,360
Trinity they come in Willow Creek is

151
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:06,830
their town too and so it yeah it's just

152
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,020
a beautiful community out there we've

153
00:07:06,829 --> 00:07:12,109
been out there for 20 years now

154
00:07:09,019 --> 00:07:16,099
and you know just trying to improve that

155
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:20,060
land we got pigs chickens goats you know

156
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:21,680
grow our name right it's all trying

157
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:24,920
trying to close those loops you know

158
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:27,350
trying to try to not have to import you

159
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:29,720
know anything really is the is the

160
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:32,330
long-term goal so we're just trying to

161
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:36,700
grow the cleanest flour we can and what

162
00:07:32,329 --> 00:07:36,699
are your like pest management strategies

163
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:42,949
Yeah right no we so we bring in good

164
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:45,970
bugs there's one thing and we surround

165
00:07:42,949 --> 00:07:48,979
our plants with various types of

166
00:07:45,970 --> 00:08:05,450
supporting plants that will help keep

167
00:07:48,980 --> 00:08:07,819
those good bugs around some of them oh

168
00:08:05,449 --> 00:08:10,339
s--- good bugs that you this editorial

169
00:08:07,819 --> 00:08:13,009
on they they thrive off a perennial

170
00:08:10,339 --> 00:08:15,379
flower that doesn't die every year and a

171
00:08:13,009 --> 00:08:17,000
lot of bad bugs are annual so we give a

172
00:08:15,379 --> 00:08:20,659
perennial flower that that particular

173
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:23,470
bug likes or right and so if you want to

174
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:23,470
keep it out of the

175
00:08:23,999 --> 00:08:30,039
marijuana's then it might be a host

176
00:08:27,728 --> 00:08:33,068
plant for them but or a barrier plant

177
00:08:30,038 --> 00:08:36,370
just keeps it like you do what you can

178
00:08:33,068 --> 00:08:39,848
do in a organic way as a living thing

179
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:42,429
right right choice right train you know

180
00:08:39,849 --> 00:08:44,649
cuz the like he was saying those bugs

181
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:47,588
are transitional especially as bedbugs

182
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:51,159
are here here for a moment and dawn and

183
00:08:47,589 --> 00:08:55,000
if we can build those perennial cultures

184
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:57,309
where you know live in forests and

185
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:01,509
living in living surrounding structures

186
00:08:57,309 --> 00:09:03,669
that are just helping support the best

187
00:09:01,509 --> 00:09:05,800
way have you found that your loss to

188
00:09:03,669 --> 00:09:08,349
insects has decreased over the years or

189
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:10,809
is any season different I mean you know

190
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:15,100
we haven't had any issues last couple

191
00:09:10,809 --> 00:09:24,099
years knock on wood right we had some of

192
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:27,100
my to take a picture of like ladybugs

193
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:31,600
just crawling all over and yeah that was

194
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:33,930
nice and we've we've been yeah we had a

195
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:37,808
rest of my problem a few years ago

196
00:09:33,929 --> 00:09:40,500
everyone happy everyone did everyone did

197
00:09:37,808 --> 00:09:43,568
and so we just you know kept bringing in

198
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:47,558
you know good bugs until finally hit the

199
00:09:43,568 --> 00:09:50,229
right one and you know then like say

200
00:09:47,558 --> 00:09:53,980
bringing in then supporting plants to

201
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:59,110
help keep those alive and trying to just

202
00:09:53,980 --> 00:10:01,058
build that ecosystem you know there's

203
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:08,409
three four of us right now fight oh you

204
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:10,360
know we've community with the plants up

205
00:10:08,409 --> 00:10:14,409
definitely they're you know they're

206
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:17,528
they're this special medicine I you know

207
00:10:14,409 --> 00:10:20,500
that's why I grow is because the ability

208
00:10:17,528 --> 00:10:22,259
to provide this quality medicine and

209
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:25,830
it's earth conscious that's not

210
00:10:22,259 --> 00:10:27,960
not using lights better than like having

211
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:30,180
to be cooled off in an artificial

212
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:33,720
environment and trying to keep it just

213
00:10:30,179 --> 00:10:37,319
as natural as we can and I grow grow

214
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:42,149
what we can in the same quality as any

215
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:45,270
indoor a better in my opinion but you

216
00:10:42,149 --> 00:10:47,009
know I the and you know the test results

217
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:48,360
are showing the same to its these are

218
00:10:47,009 --> 00:10:51,480
some of these are in the twenty four

219
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:55,409
twenty five percent THC and plus a

220
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:57,990
couple percent terpenes and so now

221
00:10:55,409 --> 00:11:01,319
you're down here in Southern California

222
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:04,980
Holly right but the land of this sort of

223
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:05,640
like outdoor bias right but it is it

224
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:10,080
changing

225
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:11,879
you know I mean I've always people come

226
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:13,770
look at the flower and they they don't

227
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:15,450
recognize this they don't as being

228
00:11:13,769 --> 00:11:17,639
outdoor doesn't look like outdoor and

229
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:21,000
that's that's been my goal and we're

230
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:23,039
just we're different right well I have

231
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,879
this idea but you know we talk to them

232
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:29,719
right know they have this idea what's

233
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:29,720
good right

234
00:11:37,389 --> 00:11:44,689
so aware I have a hard time with the

235
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:46,669
vernacular I kind of know what they're

236
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:49,870
doing that terpenes and whatnot yes

237
00:11:46,669 --> 00:11:49,870
learning as we go

238
00:11:51,429 --> 00:11:56,149
well it is exciting you know it's not

239
00:11:53,899 --> 00:11:58,069
all about the THC Orion I mean and what

240
00:11:56,149 --> 00:12:01,639
about the minor cannabinoids and all of

241
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:04,400
that you guys yeah you know we go to the

242
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:07,159
state test and you know it it does not

243
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:09,980
test for a whole you know there's only a

244
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:13,339
very short list of the the cannabinoids

245
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:16,700
that are being tested for and I really

246
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:20,000
could say yeah we had this gelato some

247
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:22,040
of the tests did but 17 somewhat tested

248
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,309
lower than that and it's really nice

249
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:29,480
flower it tastes great it covered with

250
00:12:25,309 --> 00:12:32,739
crystals really nice looking yeah ya

251
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:35,690
know all those flowers are available

252
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:39,070
then those are probably the last ascetic

253
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:47,350
because they've got that low number but

254
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:47,350
yeah correctly ethylene is

255
00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:54,309
there's two propane so that's for

256
00:12:51,629 --> 00:12:57,909
anti-inflammatory the larger molecule

257
00:12:54,309 --> 00:13:00,669
then the motion in limine so making its

258
00:12:57,909 --> 00:13:04,120
bitten so like you feel like the effects

259
00:13:00,669 --> 00:13:06,519
of no pain like it doesn't affect in you

260
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:08,830
you have an effect in your mind because

261
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:10,480
you have an absence of danger and that's

262
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:14,080
from the CB to you sure

263
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:16,350
which is what this is crippling is the

264
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:20,710
largest molecule it's the only terpene

265
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:23,649
right that is a CPG I think is what I

266
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:24,129
read today so educating myself in that

267
00:13:23,649 --> 00:13:26,319
regard

268
00:13:24,129 --> 00:13:29,230
mostly I think about finding a way to

269
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:33,370
get the most that we can in a healthy

270
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:36,129
way right so yeah what's the general we

271
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:38,500
don't want to be what we're capable of

272
00:13:36,129 --> 00:13:40,659
excellent yes so

273
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:43,120
it's just that understanding relax so

274
00:13:40,659 --> 00:13:46,629
we're learning everyday and responding

275
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:49,690
and spiraling up and it's like you

276
00:13:46,629 --> 00:13:51,730
figured that like six strange is a good

277
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:54,010
number of strange for you guys to have

278
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:55,930
like you know what yeah so yeah that's

279
00:13:54,009 --> 00:13:58,569
six to eight yeah somewhere in that

280
00:13:55,929 --> 00:14:00,250
neighborhood I like that you know plus

281
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:04,510
you got a couple of little experimental

282
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:06,429
plants or whatever just just keep keep

283
00:14:04,509 --> 00:14:09,039
that learning looking for that you know

284
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:11,739
special plant so what what are you

285
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:18,789
currently experimenting with you know

286
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:20,560
you I mean what just weeds right every

287
00:14:18,789 --> 00:14:22,809
time so far way of growing stuff you

288
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:26,979
haven't right exactly right

289
00:14:22,809 --> 00:14:31,409
we're going yeah Charlie's girl

290
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:31,409
Charlie's girl and Mack melon

291
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,678
[Music]

292
00:14:36,278 --> 00:14:41,778
even though they say oh yeah it's gonna

293
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:44,060
be different it's gonna be different in

294
00:14:41,778 --> 00:14:46,850
every farm it's gonna be you know the

295
00:14:44,059 --> 00:14:49,909
terpene profiles are different from the

296
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:52,129
same clone grow in a different place the

297
00:14:49,909 --> 00:14:53,778
weather is different you know like these

298
00:14:52,129 --> 00:14:56,208
numbers don't need anything if I don't

299
00:14:53,778 --> 00:14:58,399
know that on average we're right where

300
00:14:56,208 --> 00:15:01,278
we should be or right where or not like

301
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:03,440
it just it just gives you a volley a

302
00:15:01,278 --> 00:15:04,759
percentage of what is in that particular

303
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,100
one and then you kind of weigh in

304
00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:12,439
measure oh what's a smells like pepper

305
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:14,089
well that's a big yeah yeah we we don't

306
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:17,360
think that's really where the exciting

307
00:15:14,089 --> 00:15:19,520
future is with with you know cannabis

308
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:22,850
grown as a mono crop you know we're like

309
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:25,458
every result is exactly the same I don't

310
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:29,870
know a cigarette or something no no you

311
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:31,338
know you'd be more like open oh you know

312
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:33,950
there are certain years are better than

313
00:15:31,339 --> 00:15:36,410
others for whatever reason ya know the

314
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:38,839
weather you know when it's that time and

315
00:15:36,409 --> 00:15:41,059
that's gonna make a huge difference we

316
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:44,000
had some crazy weather is last year we

317
00:15:41,059 --> 00:15:46,009
had rainstorms when you know I wanted to

318
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,559
be harvesting this this year coming up

319
00:15:46,009 --> 00:15:51,500
so I'm like well shit that would have

320
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:53,838
been fine for the last 18 years but last

321
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:55,820
year no no that wouldn't have been okay

322
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:58,190
did you have any green house last year

323
00:15:55,820 --> 00:16:03,440
we're puttin green houses up last year

324
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:05,600
and so we had some temporary green

325
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:10,040
houses right so this is all future

326
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:11,990
happiness right oh well we we've grown

327
00:16:10,039 --> 00:16:14,629
with the green houses they were just the

328
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:16,370
temporary and you know getting that and

329
00:16:14,629 --> 00:16:18,950
we did get the permanent ones up enough

330
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:20,929
to do a crop and a half last year but it

331
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:23,250
was only we did you get them from a

332
00:16:20,929 --> 00:16:38,469
company did you

333
00:16:23,250 --> 00:17:35,549
you know explain to us what you're about

334
00:16:38,470 --> 00:17:35,549
to light electric electric electric

335
00:17:36,569 --> 00:17:41,769
sucking in butane yeah I don't think so

336
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:45,089
I was thinking you can have a lower

337
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:45,089
temperature so people could

338
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:52,610
please tell us the story about your farm

339
00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:54,919
well we've been growing up in the

340
00:17:52,609 --> 00:17:59,959
Emerald triangle there for almost 20

341
00:17:54,920 --> 00:18:03,680
years organically we just take now in

342
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:08,029
the in this legal market and that we're

343
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:10,220
doing a light depth and able to bring it

344
00:18:08,029 --> 00:18:11,869
in when the weather is just perfect

345
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:15,650
and be able to bring in the indoor

346
00:18:11,869 --> 00:18:17,389
quality while growing it outdoor and the

347
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:19,070
full Sun needs in the most

348
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:21,320
environmentally conscious met the best

349
00:18:19,069 --> 00:18:23,539
of both worlds yes exactly

350
00:18:21,319 --> 00:18:26,000
yeah we're kind of kids come by it's an

351
00:18:23,539 --> 00:18:28,339
interesting combination of almost of the

352
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,809
indoor and the outdoor in a way where

353
00:18:28,339 --> 00:18:32,029
they you know we can that do multiple

354
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:34,429
harvests a lot of people are going for

355
00:18:32,029 --> 00:18:36,379
three or four harvests I've chosen to as

356
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:39,860
I can do that with the least

357
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:42,590
environmental impact and not need much

358
00:18:39,859 --> 00:18:45,139
lights using mainly the Sun you know

359
00:18:42,589 --> 00:18:46,369
whereas some folks or I try to push a

360
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:50,890
little further you got to use a little

361
00:18:46,369 --> 00:18:54,439
more light how many different range

362
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:57,140
eight strains eight strands eaters or

363
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:59,809
the current number or looking for trying

364
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:07,040
one per greenhouse and you know it's

365
00:18:59,809 --> 00:19:09,859
this big is the goal common example the

366
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:12,470
table say you know check out some of the

367
00:19:09,859 --> 00:19:17,750
new strains see if any of them are worth

368
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:19,490
keeping we ran this 398 bubba kush this

369
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:20,259
last year and we're gonna run that again

370
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:24,819
that was

371
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:35,829
oh absolutely fire oh man it's I mean

372
00:19:24,819 --> 00:19:39,609
it's awesome 25 almost 25 percent so

373
00:19:35,829 --> 00:19:43,349
yeah we saved that for the evening this

374
00:19:39,609 --> 00:19:45,819
is a some of our hybrid and some of our

375
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:48,428
sativas like smoking though from the day

376
00:19:45,819 --> 00:19:53,528

another one you know

381
00:20:03,609 --> 00:20:08,019
run run some nice new strains this year

382
00:20:06,308 --> 00:20:10,269
we're also gonna be running the pre 90

383
00:20:08,019 --> 00:20:12,069
Bubba we're gonna maybe run some of the

384
00:20:10,269 --> 00:20:19,919

400
00:21:01,109 --> 00:21:07,048
pre 90 Bubba crushed a little too early

401
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:09,090
and I was i sat down on the bed the

402

other night and just what Pam was out in

403
00:21:09,089 --> 00:21:13,648
seconds of the other shit so what about

404
00:21:11,398 --> 00:21:15,928
taking some of your top score like resin

405
00:21:13,648 --> 00:21:19,079
or rosin you done any other have we've

406
00:21:15,929 --> 00:21:22,740
made a little bit of at home and we have

407
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:26,250
done coat collaboration with some

408
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:29,640
friends hella dink they're doing a

409
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:36,028
little collaboration with us yeah yeah

410
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:41,230
cool that one's empty haha oops we

411
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:44,138
smoked that one let's see here we go

412
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:49,120
and the Terps on that you got to give

413
00:21:44,138 --> 00:21:50,888
that a smell it's really amazing yeah

414
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:52,658
they really did a beautiful job

415
00:21:50,888 --> 00:21:56,939
I always thought hash had that one note

416
00:21:52,659 --> 00:22:00,220
hash and this is like fruit right yeah

417
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:08,590
and it's so fruity and tasty and is like

418
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:11,019
what this is ash endless endless

419
00:22:08,589 --> 00:22:12,699
oh yeah it's it's so amazing I mean well

420
00:22:11,019 --> 00:22:15,880
look where we've come in just few years

421
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:19,269
to where we expect them to be 20 plus

422
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:22,409
percent THC and like that right that was

423
00:22:19,269 --> 00:22:24,849
fucking that was the pinnacle you know

424
00:22:22,409 --> 00:22:26,860
15 years ago you see there's this new

425
00:22:24,849 --> 00:22:31,769
Washington State law they're considering

426
00:22:26,859 --> 00:22:34,119
that old cap the THC for all

427
00:22:31,769 --> 00:22:36,579
concentrates and everything at it's

428
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:38,949
something like ridiculous like 10 I

429
00:22:36,579 --> 00:22:42,879
that's not you anymore

430
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:46,419
wipe out all the every patient right

431
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:49,260
yeah that's ridiculous because some of

432
00:22:46,419 --> 00:22:54,278
us have a higher tolerance know there's

433
00:22:49,259 --> 00:23:00,099
I would put myself in that bucket

434
00:22:54,278 --> 00:23:03,099
I see the whole proceedings where

435
00:23:00,099 --> 00:23:05,888
patients have come in and started crying

436
00:23:03,099 --> 00:23:08,918
at the idea that they won't have access

437
00:23:05,888 --> 00:23:11,709
to not just you know the medicine but

438
00:23:08,919 --> 00:23:14,259
the type of medicine that they know i we

439
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:15,909
you know we're it's unfortunate like

440
00:23:14,259 --> 00:23:18,129
this whole legalization thing is

441
00:23:15,909 --> 00:23:21,309
definitely almost almost broken us

442
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:24,010
financially but at the same time I want

443
00:23:21,308 --> 00:23:25,538
this to be an organic natural evolution

444
00:23:24,009 --> 00:23:29,379
I'm not looking for outside money I'm

445
00:23:25,538 --> 00:23:32,798
just all in-house and so you know it's a

446
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:36,380
little shoestring at times but we're

447
00:23:32,798 --> 00:23:39,470
making it and just trying to

448
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:41,980
and it counts right ya know the county

449
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:41,980
has been helpful

450
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:48,580
so sometimes definitions of words change

451
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:57,019
like right in the spirit of things like

452
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:59,419
what do we need to do and then worth

453
00:23:57,019 --> 00:24:02,569
right with things that they did and

454
00:23:59,419 --> 00:24:05,240
didn't know and this is humble Trinity

455
00:24:02,569 --> 00:24:18,740
actually yeah yeah the guys we've been

456
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:21,529
working with the men because he had to

457
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:24,220
spend so much time educating himself and

458
00:24:21,529 --> 00:24:29,058
becoming aware and he's quite aware

459
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:32,569
however like had a legal right well in

460
00:24:29,058 --> 00:24:35,418
how to do the legal hoops wait we got

461
00:24:32,569 --> 00:24:37,849
right bigger what you could you could

462
00:24:35,419 --> 00:24:39,409
get away with anything on the

463
00:24:37,849 --> 00:24:41,899
pharmaceutical level that we're not

464
00:24:39,409 --> 00:24:44,630
we're being regulated so much harder oh

465
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:50,059
my god I hate to raise that a the word

466
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:53,860
but metric you know we've actually right

467
00:24:50,058 --> 00:24:56,690
right now we're using it now and the the

468
00:24:53,859 --> 00:25:00,529
we have one person that that's what she

469
00:24:56,690 --> 00:25:03,798
does is metric and so she's been doing a

470
00:25:00,529 --> 00:25:06,579
good job we're not doing job more than

471
00:25:03,798 --> 00:25:06,579
everyone else's

472
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:21,930
you guys draw straws to see you guys we

473
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:25,919
know what we know where the tachi the

474
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:28,769
weights like we have a cute lady this

475
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:31,590
thing and do I do like so that means

476
00:25:28,769 --> 00:25:39,000
right we're just making all this plastic

477
00:25:31,589 --> 00:25:42,569
tags each plants got its own tag and

478
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:47,490
when we're growing a bed of this plant

479
00:25:42,569 --> 00:25:49,559
all right we can label this bed all

480
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:52,589
right and that's one label versus now

481
00:25:49,559 --> 00:25:54,089
there's 150 plants in that bed so that's

482
00:25:52,589 --> 00:25:58,679
150 tags

483
00:25:54,089 --> 00:26:05,309
oh where does the tag go from a dead

484
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:07,230
plant usable right well the number well

485
00:26:05,309 --> 00:26:09,899
they are digital they're all they got

486
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:12,269
you know barcode and all this but then

487
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:14,210
but they because they don't reuse you

488
00:26:12,269 --> 00:26:17,849
they won't reissue that same number you

489
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:20,630
know because they want that number two

490
00:26:17,849 --> 00:26:20,629
now is done

491
00:26:21,528 --> 00:26:26,388
all right yeah we're not whaling it man

492
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:30,069
what about light the labs like if you

493
00:26:26,388 --> 00:26:32,119
guys are far from so the labs know so I

494
00:26:30,069 --> 00:26:33,678
so we don't have any problems with

495
00:26:32,119 --> 00:26:36,199
pesticides or anything because we are so

496
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:38,269
far out and we keep our stuff with clean

497
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:40,069
and we know that it's then it's another

498
00:26:38,269 --> 00:26:48,950
selling point for the brand right right

499
00:26:40,069 --> 00:26:50,509
well it's it's super water well we have

500
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:56,470
nice clean water we use the rain

501
00:26:50,509 --> 00:26:56,470
catchment and we're all off the natural

502
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:05,360
yeah yeah that's why that's what our

503
00:27:03,319 --> 00:27:08,210
water sources is rainwater catch hard in

504
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:10,819
the pond yeah no it's regenerative

505
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:13,519
farming where we were up up for the

506
00:27:10,819 --> 00:27:16,278
region of farming award doesn't leave it

507
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:18,950
better than exactly we're trying we're

508
00:27:16,278 --> 00:27:22,909
improving the property and trying to

509
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:27,139
build what we've from what we had which

510
00:27:22,909 --> 00:27:30,679
was abused by some great farming and

511
00:27:27,138 --> 00:27:33,288
trying to regenerate it into the most

512
00:27:30,679 --> 00:27:33,730
productive land we can make the pigs new

513
00:27:33,288 --> 00:27:36,599
grand

514
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:39,039
takes a concept of land and a

515
00:27:36,599 --> 00:27:42,480
blackberries like mad which is very

516
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:42,480
beneficial to pigs

517
00:27:51,609 --> 00:27:57,669
we're on 20 cent makers it's huge but we

518
00:27:55,089 --> 00:27:59,199
really don't know we live on it we built

519
00:27:57,670 --> 00:28:04,750
a straw bale house that we live in

520
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:07,809
actually I saw you taught you're off the

521
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:09,339
grid or you're well so we have a little

522
00:28:07,809 --> 00:28:10,929
bit of grid power up on one end of

523
00:28:09,339 --> 00:28:13,119
property and then the other end of the

524
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:15,400
property is off grid so we're working on

525
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:17,349
it we're gonna do a little great inner

526
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:27,580
tie to take the rest of the end of the

527
00:28:17,349 --> 00:28:31,599
last bit I mean it's not too hard for us

528
00:28:27,579 --> 00:28:34,210
there was a few buildings that had nice

529
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:39,519
metal roofs already and so we just got

530
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:42,789
her got her them over into a pond and it

531
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:46,329
just happened to be that guy some pole

532
00:28:42,789 --> 00:28:47,980
frog her like we yeah there's totally

533
00:28:46,329 --> 00:28:49,740
bullfrogs and we gotta do something

534
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:52,650
about that

535
00:28:49,740 --> 00:29:12,309
right they haven't said anything yet

536
00:28:52,650 --> 00:29:15,790
all right I know they're anti invasive

537
00:29:12,309 --> 00:29:21,179
species don't they eat insects they do

538
00:29:15,789 --> 00:29:21,180
eat insects but they also eat it exactly

539
00:29:21,789 --> 00:29:27,259
they push it out so ya know that's

540
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:29,029
that's on the list we haven't gotten

541
00:29:27,259 --> 00:29:31,179
there yet you didn't realize that yeah

542
00:29:29,029 --> 00:29:34,819
that's on the list

543
00:29:31,179 --> 00:29:36,860
yeah so how you just talk about this a

544
00:29:34,819 --> 00:29:39,319
little bit bowing down we're having fun

545
00:29:36,859 --> 00:29:40,609
it's the first time you've done it yeah

546
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:43,509
we've done some of these events before

547
00:29:40,609 --> 00:29:49,159
