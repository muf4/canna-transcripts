try to navigate the heavily complex

26
00:01:32,578 --> 00:01:37,978
ever-changing open to quite

27
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,740
interpretation by the regulatory

28
00:01:37,978 --> 00:01:42,599
agencies of the new permanent

29
00:01:40,739 --> 00:01:48,149
regulations that we have that seem to be

30
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:51,959
not so permanent as just today because

31
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:54,509
you know what I love a nice little as we

32
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:55,879
like to call it profanity cover your

33
00:01:54,509 --> 00:02:01,140
ears if you're not old enough

34
00:01:55,879 --> 00:02:03,658
fuck you Friday is something that is

35
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:06,259
perpetually happening as I'm sure we

36
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:08,729
will talk about last Friday we got an

37
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:11,009
interpretation of where that universal

38
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:12,000
symbol is going to have to go and this

39
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:14,189
Friday

40
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,430
we were alerted to the fact that there

41
00:02:14,189 --> 00:02:22,370
is a lawsuit that is imminently coming

42
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:26,430
for statewide delivery so nothing is

43
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:28,980
settled but we'll go through it all the

44
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:32,340
best that we can so I invite you to sit

45
00:02:28,979 --> 00:02:34,439
down buckle up and be excited to learn a

46
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:36,539
little bit about where we are in the

47
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:39,150
regulations right now as many of you

48
00:02:36,539 --> 00:02:41,819
know then or may know that in January

49
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:45,030
the state the office of administrative

50
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:48,289
law adopted the permanent regulations

51
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:51,000
and we put permanent in air quotes

52
00:02:48,289 --> 00:02:53,479
because as Pamela was alluding to

53
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,650
they're just starting to change already

54
00:02:53,479 --> 00:03:00,629
and those regulations unveiled

55
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:02,849
manok a new reality that many of us saw

56
00:03:00,629 --> 00:03:06,900
coming that was pretty similar to the

57
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:10,949
last draft submitted before and there

58
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:13,050
were some major implications for for

59
00:03:10,949 --> 00:03:15,629
businesses and operators so I guess

60
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:17,910
first if you guys want to talk about a

61
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:20,250
couple off the top of your head of what

62
00:03:17,909 --> 00:03:22,979
you felt were the biggest implications

63
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:26,819
or impacts of the adopted permanent regs

64
00:03:22,979 --> 00:03:27,929
I guess I personally feel like I mean we

65
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:30,180
knew what was going to be coming down

66
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:32,610
the line we we could we could read them

67
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:34,500
and strategize on them and and I'm used

68
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:38,459
to just as soon as the regulations come

69
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:40,139
out it's always a sucky Friday speaking

70
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:42,299
about that I am NOT speaking on behalf

71
00:03:40,139 --> 00:03:44,578
of Josas I'm speaking on behalf of Brett

72
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:51,900
Hartman and so I just wanted to go ahead

73
00:03:44,579 --> 00:03:52,950
and put that out there so I was getting

74
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,920
used to seeing a lot of stuff and it was

75
00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:57,959
like seeing goals and and marketing

76
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:59,939
goals and and personal dreams just kind

77
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:01,439
of go down the crapper real quick and

78
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:03,329
where it was like okay you're not gonna

79
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:05,039
be able to do this and and should you be

80
00:04:03,329 --> 00:04:07,230
able to explain to clients that why you

81
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:09,359
can't get free product and why you can't

82
00:04:07,229 --> 00:04:11,789
get free swag and why you can't just

83
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,100
label anything and just think that the

84
00:04:11,789 --> 00:04:15,629
BCC is gonna pass it for branded

85
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:16,858
merchandise when I don't even think

86
00:04:15,629 --> 00:04:20,279
they're even getting back to people

87
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:22,168
right now so for me it was just telling

88
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:26,039
everybody's like you need to focus on

89
00:04:22,168 --> 00:04:28,319
your core values as a company your team

90
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:30,240
and and whether this because things are

91
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:31,680
gonna get better but we're gonna go

92
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,199
through some pretty dark tons right now

93
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:37,439
and I think the regulations have put a

94
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:39,689
squash on a lot of flexibility for

95
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:43,500
everything from marketing to production

96
00:04:39,689 --> 00:04:45,389
to products and seeing conflicting

97
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:47,790
information through them all because

98
00:04:45,389 --> 00:04:49,709
like I went through and completely

99
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:55,050
reformatted the regulations and added a

100
00:04:49,709 --> 00:04:57,239
table of contents and yes it's the Bible

101
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:59,730
yeah so I think for me it was really

102
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:01,800
difficult to see the amount of effort us

103
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:06,000
and the industry are putting into a

104
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:08,160
regulated market but the way that the

105
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,689
regulations were submitted to a way that

106
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,550
we could read them made them near

107
00:05:09,689 --> 00:05:13,680
impossible to understand if you don't

108
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:16,500
have like a strong English grammar

109
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,910
background or in and I'm a have a

110
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,589
technical writing background so where I

111
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:21,900
had to go through there and and make

112
00:05:19,589 --> 00:05:23,699
them to where they were easily usable

113
00:05:21,899 --> 00:05:26,189
because none of this made sense to me

114
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:28,529
either and luckily I've been able to

115
00:05:26,189 --> 00:05:31,170
read through how many generations of

116
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:32,339
rags so it's like I was able to go

117
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:37,710
through it but I see conflicting

118
00:05:32,339 --> 00:05:40,259
information all over the place one of

119
00:05:37,709 --> 00:05:42,629
the most important things to remember is

120
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:45,420
as clunky as these regulations are as

121
00:05:42,629 --> 00:05:47,100
difficult as they are I remind my

122
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:48,810
clients and every time I send out an

123
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,320
email and I say this is why we have to

124
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:52,800
do something

125
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:54,060
Irie purposefully put that regulation in

126
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,920
there because it should be a dialogue

127
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:58,680
that you're having when you hire

128
00:05:55,920 --> 00:06:01,610
somebody as amazing as Julie or bread or

129
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:03,449
myself and my team Samantha is here and

130
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:05,370
you want to be able to have a

131
00:06:03,449 --> 00:06:08,459
conversation with us right we're all

132
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:10,560
reading them you have to frame your lens

133
00:06:08,459 --> 00:06:13,680
about what you want to do as Brett said

134
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,389
what is your core culture that you want

135
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,730
to have and to have a culture of

136
00:06:15,389 --> 00:06:20,129
compliance you need to own that and I

137
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:22,800
think I say it almost at nauseam to my

138
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:26,009
clients you're the people that you

139
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:28,020
employ from your employee and even the

140
00:06:26,009 --> 00:06:30,599
the janitor that may because the city

141
00:06:28,019 --> 00:06:33,509
says has to clean up twice a day they

142
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:37,080
you're their act omission or failure is

143
00:06:33,509 --> 00:06:39,589
your act omission or failure we can see

144
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:42,389
it when we saw the issue with Sequoia

145
00:06:39,589 --> 00:06:44,219
that lab technician had an issue but

146
00:06:42,389 --> 00:06:47,250
that could cost Sequoia Labs ultimately

147
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:49,320
their license so you need to be familiar

148
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:51,329
with these regulations as daunting as

149
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:53,969
they are as difficult as they are to

150
00:06:51,329 --> 00:06:55,589
wade through read them and then have

151
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:57,300
that conversation with your internal

152
00:06:55,589 --> 00:06:59,639
team have that conversation with your

153
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:02,400
external team and I think that's been

154
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:05,339
the the most difficult lift when these

155
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:07,259
regulations went active and permitted

156
00:07:05,339 --> 00:07:09,269
people didn't really understand what

157
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:11,219
that meant they we knew that we had been

158
00:07:09,269 --> 00:07:13,500
dealing with emergency regulations and

159
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:16,590
changes and we had as we affectionately

160
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:18,689
called regulatory whiplash where you

161
00:07:16,589 --> 00:07:20,549
know I on July 1

162
00:07:18,689 --> 00:07:22,379
there was fire sale and you had to get

163
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:24,540
rid of and make sure you had CRP on the

164
00:07:22,379 --> 00:07:27,480
package and now we're back to CRP and

165
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:29,340
the exit bags or CRP at the product

166
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:31,950
level and what does that mean for your

167
00:07:29,339 --> 00:07:35,579
company understand that if you have a

168
00:07:31,949 --> 00:07:38,430
deadline on January 1 of 2020 and all of

169
00:07:35,579 --> 00:07:40,649
the product must be at CRP at the level

170
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:42,740
of 2020 that doesn't mean in in December

171
00:07:40,649 --> 00:07:45,060
you can change your packaging regime

172
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:46,710
that doesn't mean that the retailer will

173
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:49,319
sell out of your product by then that'll

174
00:07:46,709 --> 00:07:50,219
have to be destroyed so when you think

175
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:53,189
about that you've got to think about

176
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:54,480
timelines and backdating what these what

177
00:07:53,189 --> 00:07:56,850
these dates in these regulations

178
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:58,740
actually mean I don't know flip side of

179
00:07:56,850 --> 00:08:00,810
that understanding that once we have

180
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:02,790
final regulations and the regula the

181
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:05,009
regulators are no longer going back to

182
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:07,530
these regulations whole-hog trying to

183
00:08:05,009 --> 00:08:09,389
get us to a point where we have

184
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:12,119
permanent regulations they're gonna

185
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:14,310
start looking to enforce upon the

186
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:16,800
regulations and that's a different

187
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:18,589
ballgame that means when the regulator's

188
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,730
come out there are no longer

189
00:08:18,589 --> 00:08:22,949
fact-finding information they've

190
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:24,210
collected that data points they know

191
00:08:22,949 --> 00:08:26,279
what you're doing at these facilities

192
00:08:24,209 --> 00:08:28,589
you invited them in you had great

193
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:30,000
conversations with them oh I thought

194
00:08:28,589 --> 00:08:32,129
they were great we were making friends

195
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,929
they're coming now for enforcement and

196
00:08:32,129 --> 00:08:35,399
I'm sure we'll get there and we'll talk

197
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:37,139
about the enforcement guidelines which

198
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:39,740
are not part of the regulations that I

199
00:08:37,139 --> 00:08:44,220
don't think most people have read one

200
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:46,139
missing manifests can have no no less

201
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:48,149
than I think six other violations that

202
00:08:46,139 --> 00:08:50,580
are associated with it that affect not

203
00:08:48,149 --> 00:08:52,889
only your license but the licensee that

204
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:54,600
was involved in that transaction

205
00:08:52,889 --> 00:08:56,850
which could be more than one licensee

206
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:59,670
and they have fines that are based off

207
00:08:56,850 --> 00:09:01,860
of how much revenue you make divided by

208
00:08:59,669 --> 00:09:04,949
50% times the amount of days that you've

209
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:06,839
been in business plus they could shut

210
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:08,129
you down so you're looking at fines that

211
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:11,850
could be in the hundreds of thousands of

212
00:09:08,129 --> 00:09:15,169
dollars for one manifest so invest in

213
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:19,050
training and a culture of compliance

214
00:09:15,169 --> 00:09:21,028
indeed I was just talking to my friend

215
00:09:19,049 --> 00:09:23,009
Rick before this where I was taught like

216
00:09:21,028 --> 00:09:25,019
the regulations who were saying he was

217
00:09:23,009 --> 00:09:27,000
saying is it's sort of like having car

218
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:28,320
insurance where car insurance sucks and

219
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,759
you spend all this money on car

220
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,320
insurance and most of the time you're

221
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:33,208
like why am i spending all this money on

222
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:36,720
car insurance but then when something

223
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:38,849
goes wrong you're super happy you have

224
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,649
car insurance and you're super happy you

225
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:42,950
have a low deductible and that's kind of

226
00:09:40,649 --> 00:09:46,289
what that culture of compliance does I

227
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:50,339
frequently call a record-keeping audit

228
00:09:46,289 --> 00:09:53,069
by the agencies when penalties and fines

229
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:56,430
are in effect is the new smash-and-grab

230
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:59,160
you could shut down any company right

231
00:09:56,429 --> 00:10:01,139
now with hundreds of thousands of

232
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:03,929
dollars if not millions of dollars in

233
00:10:01,139 --> 00:10:05,578
penalties and fines just for asking for

234
00:10:03,929 --> 00:10:09,719
their records because in the business

235
00:10:05,578 --> 00:10:12,239
and Professions Code a single failure to

236
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:15,839
be able to provide a record can carry a

237
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:17,610
penalty of $30,000 per instance per

238
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:20,790
piece of paper that you're unable to

239
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:23,070
immediately produce and not just you but

240
00:10:20,789 --> 00:10:25,169
your staff who's working at the moment

241
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:26,820
that they happen to come in and ask for

242
00:10:25,169 --> 00:10:29,338
that piece of paper if they are not

243
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:31,230
adequately trained to do what they need

244
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:34,079
to do to immediately provide the thing

245
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:36,360
that was requested you can be looking at

246
00:10:34,078 --> 00:10:39,569
incurring some serious fines we haven't

247
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:42,389
seen the full muscle of penalties and

248
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:45,510
fines being exerted but we also have a

249
00:10:42,389 --> 00:10:48,659
situation where the regulatory agencies

250
00:10:45,509 --> 00:10:50,759
have up to five years to levy those

251
00:10:48,659 --> 00:10:53,338
penalties and fines for things you did

252
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:55,289
in year one so they can go back years

253
00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:58,230
later and go hey let's do a full audit

254
00:10:55,289 --> 00:11:01,019
of what you were doing between 2007 18

255
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:02,909
to 2019 and many

256
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:06,769
companies are not gonna be in a position

257
00:11:02,909 --> 00:11:08,429
to be able to stand up to that audit

258
00:11:06,769 --> 00:11:10,079
because there's a lot it's very

259
00:11:08,429 --> 00:11:12,959
difficult in our position is very

260
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:15,810
difficult at this moment to to really

261
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:17,550
like you know cry the credo of the

262
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:19,619
importance of compliance when most

263
00:11:17,549 --> 00:11:20,969
people are like track and trace isn't

264
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:23,399
active nobody knows there's no

265
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:26,100
enforcement nobody's checking and and

266
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:28,289
from our incredibly cautionary side of

267
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:30,750
it it's like these people are not your

268
00:11:28,289 --> 00:11:34,860
friends no they're not super stoked

269
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:38,059
about this and it's a huge funnel of

270
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:40,019
money for the bureaucratic government so

271
00:11:38,059 --> 00:11:41,669
do you think they're not gonna come

272
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:44,730
around and collect fines when they can

273
00:11:41,669 --> 00:11:46,439
when when the licensing craze dries up

274
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:48,750
when it becomes more difficult for

275
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:50,490
people to on board I think they're gonna

276
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:53,129
be coming and finding do you know things

277
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:54,930
to penalize on and let's keep in mind as

278
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:56,700
well that every company that's

279
00:11:54,929 --> 00:11:58,019
functioning is also videotaping

280
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:01,290
everything that they're doing and

281
00:11:58,019 --> 00:12:03,389
keeping those videos for 90 days so the

282
00:12:01,289 --> 00:12:06,269
new urban legend that I just heard is

283
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:08,399
the the operator who the BCC comes in

284
00:12:06,269 --> 00:12:11,460
and caught somebody consuming and then

285
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:13,139
they requested their tapes and then they

286
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:14,639
reviewed the tapes and then they dinged

287
00:12:13,139 --> 00:12:16,699
them for every time somebody was

288
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:18,509
consuming on video and then it's

289
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:22,110
$300,000 in fines

290
00:12:18,509 --> 00:12:24,929
so it can happen but you know there's

291
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:26,070
also preventative measures one big thing

292
00:12:24,929 --> 00:12:28,709
I want to say because we're talking a

293
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:31,620
lot of like you must do this and comply

294
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:34,170
one of your biggest assets that you

295
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:38,159
control are your standard operating

296
00:12:34,169 --> 00:12:39,659
procedures your SOPs these can save you

297
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:42,779
they're like think of them as like a

298
00:12:39,659 --> 00:12:45,110
salvation right everything that you do

299
00:12:42,779 --> 00:12:48,659
when there's an ambiguity in the

300
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:50,460
regulations you do an SOP for that you

301
00:12:48,659 --> 00:12:52,529
base it off of your understanding of the

302
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:55,290
regulations therefore if there is an

303
00:12:52,529 --> 00:12:58,350
enforcement action you can show this is

304
00:12:55,289 --> 00:12:59,699
what I have on file this is my SOP this

305
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:02,129
is why I did it this way

306
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:04,770
agencies let's discuss this this is not

307
00:13:02,129 --> 00:13:07,710
how we read it this is not how we did it

308
00:13:04,769 --> 00:13:09,269
more so to the point when I have a point

309
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:11,759
of clarification that I wanted to make

310
00:13:09,269 --> 00:13:13,169
my operator wanted to have the packaging

311
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:14,429
in the packaging date and the

312
00:13:13,169 --> 00:13:17,129
manufacture date the

313
00:13:14,429 --> 00:13:19,338
same date right they were like this is

314
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:21,778
how we do it at our facility we

315
00:13:19,339 --> 00:13:23,490
manufacture the pens we fill the pens on

316
00:13:21,778 --> 00:13:25,230
the same day manufacture date package

317
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:26,519
date same date now there's nothing to

318
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:28,350
say that you can't do that there was

319
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:30,480
nothing to say that you could do that so

320
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:32,310
the response that I got back from DPH

321
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,110
when we had drafted an email that said

322
00:13:32,309 --> 00:13:35,969
if our package 8 and our manufacture

323
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:39,720
date are the same date and we have that

324
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:44,550
in our SOP and I put do M /p or I put

325
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:46,528
the M F G and P kg is that enough on the

326
00:13:44,549 --> 00:13:51,299
label and I put it in there and they

327
00:13:46,528 --> 00:13:54,480
said I think that should be fine okay so

328
00:13:51,299 --> 00:13:57,990
I take that email that says you're fine

329
00:13:54,480 --> 00:14:00,028
I put it in with my SOP I date it it's

330
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:03,450
there it's it's in my record-keeping

331
00:14:00,028 --> 00:14:05,700
therefore if a retail purchasing manager

332
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:08,670
when my manufacturer distributor takes

333
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:10,230
this product with them says I don't know

334
00:14:08,669 --> 00:14:12,208
if I'm allowed to do that I don't see

335
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:14,070
anybody else doing that you say well I

336
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:16,169
understand that but I have a letter from

337
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:18,420
DPH that I can show you that says that

338
00:14:16,169 --> 00:14:21,509
this is fine same thing happened where

339
00:14:18,419 --> 00:14:24,000
we wanted to do a foil seal on the jar

340
00:14:21,509 --> 00:14:26,189
of cannabis instead of doing a tamper

341
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,259
evidence seal on the outer package now

342
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:31,650
what is every retail purchasing manager

343
00:14:28,259 --> 00:14:33,539
used to seeing a tamper evidence seal on

344
00:14:31,649 --> 00:14:35,429
the side of the bottle what are they

345
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:37,610
gonna do if they don't see a tamper

346
00:14:35,429 --> 00:14:39,929
evidence see on the side of the bottle

347
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:42,629
reject it and send it back to be

348
00:14:39,929 --> 00:14:44,338
properly labeled with a tamper evidence

349
00:14:42,629 --> 00:14:46,439
seal it is properly labeled with a

350
00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:48,540
tamper evidence seal why because we put

351
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:50,940
it in our SOP or I had the client put it

352
00:14:48,539 --> 00:14:53,789
in their SOP we guy we sent the images

353
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:55,800
to g ph g ph said you could have

354
00:14:53,789 --> 00:14:57,719
multi-layer packaging or multi layer

355
00:14:55,799 --> 00:14:59,639
tamper evident as long as the consumer

356
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,709
can tell if it was tampered with before

357
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:03,689
they get to the product we put it in

358
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:05,879
there we packaged it up every single

359
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:08,310
time that shipment goes out in a

360
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:11,100
distribution vehicle it is affixed with

361
00:15:08,309 --> 00:15:13,828
the letter and the image so that anytime

362
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:17,009
it's it's threatened to be refused which

363
00:15:13,828 --> 00:15:18,689
will and does happen we have evidence to

364
00:15:17,009 --> 00:15:20,759
support that so that transaction moves

365
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:24,540
through the supply chain smoothly

366
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:26,610
these SOPs can prevent you from hundreds

367
00:15:24,539 --> 00:15:28,049
of thousands of dollars of fines taking

368
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:30,360
it all the way down to a few

369
00:15:28,049 --> 00:15:32,639
dollars or even oh you're right that was

370
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:35,730
confusing let's make a change or a

371
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:39,679
clarification to the regulations and as

372
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:42,300
a former dispensary manager and director

373
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:44,909
especially during all this transition it

374
00:15:42,299 --> 00:15:46,078
was really difficult to know what you

375
00:15:44,909 --> 00:15:48,719
were supposed to be looking for on the

376
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:50,549
packaging and we had to go through and

377
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,200
make a checklist of like these are the

378
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:54,149
things you should look for if it's not

379
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:56,430
there you know don't and there's

380
00:15:54,149 --> 00:15:58,589
sometimes things fell through the cracks

381
00:15:56,429 --> 00:16:01,169
as far as like we had to be rejected

382
00:15:58,589 --> 00:16:02,370
product that you know I wasn't in the

383
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:03,958
store so they're telling me it's not on

384
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:05,730
the lism like well then send it back and

385
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:07,109
it sure enough it was somewhere on there

386
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:08,399
and so I mean I feel for these

387
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:11,220
distributors right now because they're

388
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,778
dealing with dispensaries at all

389
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:15,930
different levels of understanding of the

390
00:16:12,778 --> 00:16:16,740
regulations and for me is like my heart

391
00:16:15,929 --> 00:16:19,078
really goes out for some of these

392
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:23,278
longtime operators that are more of like

393
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:27,239
artisanal craft cannabis because SOPs

394
00:16:23,278 --> 00:16:30,600
are not part of their SOP they don't do

395
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:32,370
this because it's part of their art but

396
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:35,579
in order for them to translate from our

397
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:37,320
former you know unregulated market into

398
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:39,389
this new market they have to have

399
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:40,649
something that you can replicate you

400
00:16:39,389 --> 00:16:42,539
have to have something that you can show

401
00:16:40,649 --> 00:16:44,519
and standard operating procedures

402
00:16:42,539 --> 00:16:46,259
usually freak people up because they're

403
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:48,000
like oh you know like I don't know how

404
00:16:46,259 --> 00:16:50,879
to write these and it's as simple as

405
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,578
it's just a how-to it's how you want it

406
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:55,019
to be done just click on bullet points

407
00:16:53,578 --> 00:16:56,429
when you're writing it in something and

408
00:16:55,019 --> 00:16:58,620
just make sure you're just going step by

409
00:16:56,429 --> 00:17:01,078
step on there and making sure that

410
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:02,789
you're you're doing it and a and it's

411
00:17:01,078 --> 00:17:04,139
time where you can walk somebody through

412
00:17:02,789 --> 00:17:06,720
it that's never done it they can follow

413
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:08,490
the roles and it makes sense so that

414
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,259
you're not missing any places on there

415
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:12,269
and I think that's where right now is a

416
00:17:10,259 --> 00:17:13,740
lot of companies how did not understand

417
00:17:12,269 --> 00:17:15,779
what it was going to take to weather

418
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:17,568
this storm of regulations and they've

419
00:17:15,779 --> 00:17:19,859
been hemorrhaging money

420
00:17:17,568 --> 00:17:21,359
everywhere and then you have these new

421
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:22,859
companies that are going to be that are

422
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:24,688
starting that have learned the lessons

423
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:26,369
from everybody around them and they just

424
00:17:24,689 --> 00:17:28,669
start off right off the bat because

425
00:17:26,369 --> 00:17:31,799
they're bringing in executives now with

426
00:17:28,669 --> 00:17:33,470
other industry experience that they know

427
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:35,909
what it takes to run a business and

428
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:37,200
they're gonna come in here and pass up

429
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:40,090
all of these companies right now and I

430
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:42,970
remember when I got into this industry

431
00:17:40,089 --> 00:17:46,089
five years ago and and where we were at

432
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:47,710
and then whenever we passed prop 64 they

433
00:17:46,089 --> 00:17:49,418
said immediately like 90 percent of the

434
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:51,880
companies that you see today are not

435
00:17:49,419 --> 00:17:53,350
going to be here and it's sadly I know

436
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:56,110
that it's more than that like they're

437
00:17:53,349 --> 00:17:57,849
just not being able to to handle this

438
00:17:56,109 --> 00:17:59,589
regulated market and I don't blame them

439
00:17:57,849 --> 00:18:00,969
a lot of it has to go down to the

440
00:17:59,589 --> 00:18:05,230
culture of the business that you built

441
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:08,620
before is that a compliant culture it

442
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:11,019
starts from the top so remember that if

443
00:18:08,619 --> 00:18:13,329
you're the owner of these businesses you

444
00:18:11,019 --> 00:18:14,819
have to want to do this to have your

445
00:18:13,329 --> 00:18:17,019
employees want to do it

446
00:18:14,819 --> 00:18:19,058
training's I can't tell you how

447
00:18:17,019 --> 00:18:21,339
important they are you may think that

448
00:18:19,058 --> 00:18:22,750
your about tenders know what to do they

449
00:18:21,339 --> 00:18:24,158
don't know what you do do you know what

450
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:28,359
the single scariest thing in the world

451
00:18:24,159 --> 00:18:30,429
is when the auditors come when the BCC

452
00:18:28,359 --> 00:18:32,079
comes what are they supposed to do do

453
00:18:30,429 --> 00:18:34,030
they know who their first point of

454
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:36,038
contact is do they know that they're not

455
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:38,798
allowed to not give them access to

456
00:18:36,038 --> 00:18:40,750
information the longer a regulator sits

457
00:18:38,798 --> 00:18:42,940
and waits for them to figure out who to

458
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:45,849
call and what to do they're looking

459
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:48,038
they're looking for problems right if

460
00:18:45,849 --> 00:18:49,839
they're just sitting around looking

461
00:18:48,038 --> 00:18:51,819
they're gonna find the non-compliant

462
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:53,529
product on the shelf does everybody know

463
00:18:51,819 --> 00:18:56,740
that they got to check-in is everything

464
00:18:53,529 --> 00:18:58,509
leaving in an opaque bag right doesn't

465
00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:00,548
matter how small the product is it's got

466
00:18:58,509 --> 00:19:03,759
to leave your retail store in an opaque

467
00:19:00,548 --> 00:19:06,099
bag prepare them do unannounced audits

468
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:08,740
hire outside companies to come in and

469
00:19:06,099 --> 00:19:11,139
audit your business it is not that you

470
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:13,630
are doing something wrong if Julie or

471
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:16,390
Brett or I or somebody else shows up to

472
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:17,950
help you we're not there to highlight

473
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:19,390
what you're doing wrong we're there to

474
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:21,700
highlight what you could be doing better

475
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:23,590
and to provide you with a mechanism to

476
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:25,798
get there like Brett said these are

477
00:19:23,589 --> 00:19:28,720
how-to things if you're an artisanal

478
00:19:25,798 --> 00:19:31,450
cannabis company you know how to do that

479
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:33,159
you do the same thing every time just

480
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:34,840
write it down they don't have to be

481
00:19:33,159 --> 00:19:37,240
pretty they don't have to look like

482
00:19:34,839 --> 00:19:39,730
these wonderful beautiful SOPs they have

483
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:42,220
to be usable and workable and if they're

484
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:44,288
using them and you're training people to

485
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:46,150
do them then you're ensuring that that

486
00:19:44,288 --> 00:19:47,589
same thing we talked about earlier that

487
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:50,409
active omission or failure isn't

488
00:19:47,589 --> 00:19:52,119
happening to you marketing I think is

489
00:19:50,409 --> 00:19:53,570
the single biggest thing that may take

490
00:19:52,119 --> 00:19:54,829
people out besides sequa

491
00:19:53,569 --> 00:19:59,589
that they're not paying attention to

492
00:19:54,829 --> 00:20:03,349
when you advertise on social media your

493
00:19:59,589 --> 00:20:05,689
license number should be synonymous with

494
00:20:03,349 --> 00:20:07,730
your logo if you're gonna put your logo

495
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:10,910
on something you're gonna put your

496
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:13,339
license number on something one without

497
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:16,220
the other doesn't work and I think we

498
00:20:13,339 --> 00:20:18,679
can take a good learning lesson from

499
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:21,769
some of the biggest dispensary arguable

500
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:24,019
operators in the state if you have six

501
00:20:21,769 --> 00:20:26,450
dispensaries and you do a leaflet that

502
00:20:24,019 --> 00:20:30,950
you put out in the newspaper you do not

503
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:33,470
put one license number on there you put

504
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:36,110
all five or six license numbers if you

505
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:38,900
are saying I have stores in six

506
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:40,909
different locations if I can leave you

507
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:44,030
guys with one piece of advice it's don't

508
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:45,040
be cute with the agencies they don't

509
00:20:44,029 --> 00:20:49,519
think it's cute

510
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:51,339
be ahead of your compliance make it a

511
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:55,279
part of your living breathing

512
00:20:51,339 --> 00:20:56,990
organization and if you are the manager

513
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:59,660
if you are the owner if you are somebody

514
00:20:56,990 --> 00:21:02,000
who is in charge make it a priority for

515
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:04,850
you because people learn by what they

516
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,309
see see one do one teach one the same

517
00:21:04,849 --> 00:21:10,099
applies here well I was just gonna say

518
00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:13,159
and this is just another point that if

519
00:21:10,099 --> 00:21:16,429
you sell a product if you sell products

520
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:18,410
in your store like your business is not

521
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:20,539
selling product your business is not

522
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:22,910
making a product your business is

523
00:21:20,539 --> 00:21:25,549
supporting a team of people and

524
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:26,810
inspiring them to stay so motivated

525
00:21:25,549 --> 00:21:28,849
they're not gonna put your license at

526
00:21:26,809 --> 00:21:30,740
risk and it's like as long as you let

527
00:21:28,849 --> 00:21:33,379
people know what to regulate these this

528
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:36,529
is the boundaries that you must reside

529
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:40,610
in and you and and and letting them know

530
00:21:36,529 --> 00:21:42,740
that like that their mistakes reflect on

531
00:21:40,609 --> 00:21:44,119
the company not them and that they're

532
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:46,460
putting your license and you take care

533
00:21:44,119 --> 00:21:49,069
of your team and you support them and

534
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:50,360
you provide them with better than what

535
00:21:49,069 --> 00:21:51,529
other companies are doing what you're

536
00:21:50,359 --> 00:21:53,419
not going to deal with the turnover

537
00:21:51,529 --> 00:21:55,160
because right now turnover is happening

538
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:56,420
everywhere in the industry because

539
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:58,759
you're taking these people that have

540
00:21:56,420 --> 00:22:00,740
been bud tenders for years and now

541
00:21:58,759 --> 00:22:03,549
they're worth so much from their

542
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:05,559
knowledge in the industry and applicable

543
00:22:03,549 --> 00:22:08,589
experience and

544
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:10,319
and and and if they're motivated enough

545
00:22:08,589 --> 00:22:12,459
to do it they can move up from there and

546
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:14,799
I've seen people from other industries

547
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:17,920
come into this industry and yes they

548
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:21,039
bring valuable skills and experience

549
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:23,710
that we need to help polish us but if

550
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:26,680
they don't understand what it's like to

551
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:29,710
work in a highly regulated market

552
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:32,019
they're going to fill their dreams and

553
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:34,029
their aspirations for their job just die

554
00:22:32,019 --> 00:22:37,690
because all you do is tell people all

555
00:22:34,029 --> 00:22:43,589
day no that's what it is it is such an

556
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:46,600
incredibly strange and amazing

557
00:22:43,589 --> 00:22:51,099
evolutionary historical moment that

558
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:52,750
we're in in terms of you know some of

559
00:22:51,099 --> 00:22:56,490
the cannabis industry from my

560
00:22:52,750 --> 00:23:00,640
perspective is you took a culture of

561
00:22:56,490 --> 00:23:02,980
underground activists and now you've put

562
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:07,780
them in business casual clothing and

563
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:11,410
turned them into ninjas who have to play

564
00:23:07,779 --> 00:23:14,859
an insane high-stakes tetris match with

565
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:19,000
the government and like state and local

566
00:23:14,859 --> 00:23:21,429
ordinances to preserve like the soul of

567
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:25,150
what they were trying to do you know

568
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:27,970
like it's like this is the part I like

569
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:32,310
to make clear of like we're in this

570
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:36,339
weird you know running match with like

571
00:23:32,309 --> 00:23:39,490
fucking target to decide who gets to

572
00:23:36,339 --> 00:23:41,709
have this industry you know and and some

573
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:43,720
of us are like I got to get more hair

574
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:46,690
gel and be corporate and let's fucking

575
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:49,390
do this you know and in its in its the

576
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:53,620
biggest like philosophical quandary I

577
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:56,500
have day by day of how do we create the

578
00:23:53,619 --> 00:24:00,309
world we want to create with this

579
00:23:56,500 --> 00:24:03,099
industry like how do we get to sit at

580
00:24:00,309 --> 00:24:05,740
the table how do we get to navigate the

581
00:24:03,099 --> 00:24:08,559
process how do we get to participate in

582
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:11,170
inform policy which is still being

583
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:13,599
written and for God's sakes please let

584
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:16,330
it be written by us like please let it

585
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:17,939
be written by the people who suffered

586
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:21,119
and built the

587
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:23,009
industry not by the yahoos coming from

588
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:24,719
Varma who are like I've got this now

589
00:24:23,009 --> 00:24:26,990
thanks for warming my seat we're good

590
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:30,269
let's do this you know it's it's

591
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:32,099
ethnically insane and questionable that

592
00:24:30,269 --> 00:24:33,929
so many people are excited about making

593
00:24:32,099 --> 00:24:38,189
money in cannabis while people are still

594
00:24:33,929 --> 00:24:42,419
in jail for cannabis crimes it's insane

595
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:44,519
that John Boehner and the Republicans

596
00:24:42,419 --> 00:24:46,470
and Mitch whatever the hell his name is

597
00:24:44,519 --> 00:24:48,839
and all the excited people about hamper

598
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:52,139
like let's put CBD in malls you know

599
00:24:48,839 --> 00:24:54,599
that is insane to me while we are still

600
00:24:52,138 --> 00:24:57,388
struggling to get our social equity

601
00:24:54,599 --> 00:25:01,259
applicants operational in Los Angeles

602
00:24:57,388 --> 00:25:04,219
it's it's completely insane so as boring

603
00:25:01,259 --> 00:25:07,740
as it sounds to some people about

604
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:10,740
compliance in these things like we are

605
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:13,200
your ninja team that is here to like

606
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:17,628
sleep dart the agencies and keep them

607
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,629
off your ass you know this is our job

608
00:25:21,138 --> 00:25:27,479
but to your point do not just take money

609
00:25:24,569 --> 00:25:30,928
I have to make the bit I have to because

610
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:34,528
don't do it you're getting into bed with

611
00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:37,320
people I can't express it enough I know

612
00:25:34,528 --> 00:25:40,829
I know the feeling the urgency like when

613
00:25:37,319 --> 00:25:42,599
it was 20 2007 2017 and he wanted to get

614
00:25:40,829 --> 00:25:44,609
licenses and like hardly any

615
00:25:42,599 --> 00:25:46,528
jurisdictions were issuing licenses it

616
00:25:44,609 --> 00:25:48,449
was like finding the unicorn or the

617
00:25:46,528 --> 00:25:50,788
needle in the haystack more and more

618
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:53,460
people are coming online do not I

619
00:25:50,788 --> 00:25:57,839
implore you do not collect these

620
00:25:53,460 --> 00:26:01,710
licenses and not be able to operate them

621
00:25:57,839 --> 00:26:05,908
if you've got seven licenses and none of

622
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:09,808
them are like 50% compliant then stop

623
00:26:05,909 --> 00:26:12,360
getting more please just it's not gonna

624
00:26:09,808 --> 00:26:13,769
help you to if you think that the more

625
00:26:12,359 --> 00:26:16,378
licenses you have that are

626
00:26:13,769 --> 00:26:18,179
non-operational are not functional to

627
00:26:16,378 --> 00:26:19,798
survive a compliance audit because I

628
00:26:18,179 --> 00:26:22,649
promise you that big money that Julie is

629
00:26:19,798 --> 00:26:25,288
talking about they're hiring us to do a

630
00:26:22,648 --> 00:26:26,939
due diligence of your business and I

631
00:26:25,288 --> 00:26:28,470
can't lie I mean I'm not gonna lie

632
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:30,298
Brett's not gonna lie Julie's not gonna

633
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:31,519
lie that's gonna do a disservice so

634
00:26:30,298 --> 00:26:33,980
don't just go picking up

635
00:26:31,519 --> 00:26:36,589
licenses thinking like Oh pharma company

636
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:38,000
come buy all of my licenses that don't

637
00:26:36,589 --> 00:26:39,529
mean anything because I haven't taken

638
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,200
them through the second step of the

639
00:26:39,529 --> 00:26:43,069
process and aren't transferable that was

640
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,630
getting to that

641
00:26:43,069 --> 00:26:46,639
so you haven't gotten them activated

642
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:48,740
because the end of the beginning is

643
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:50,330
getting your business license you got to

644
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:52,609
get through planning and building which

645
00:26:50,329 --> 00:26:54,379
let me tell you is not a two-week ordeal

646
00:26:52,609 --> 00:26:55,699
if a contractor tells you don't worry

647
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:58,760
we're going to get through this see you

648
00:26:55,700 --> 00:27:01,519
pee in like two months you're going to

649
00:26:58,759 --> 00:27:03,200
be good you're gonna be operating you

650
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:05,089
you should have them sign their name in

651
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,980
blood and be able to pay for all of the

652
00:27:05,089 --> 00:27:11,480
fines that you will incur for that not

653
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:13,400
happening but also read your regulations

654
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:15,519
where you are getting these licenses if

655
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:17,690
they say they are non-transferable

656
00:27:15,519 --> 00:27:19,509
licenses just like if you got one from

657
00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:23,660
the BCC it says it right on their

658
00:27:19,509 --> 00:27:25,730
non-transferable that word means and I

659
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:31,100
feel like it needs to be said it means

660
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:32,960
it's not transferable that you make a

661
00:27:31,099 --> 00:27:35,829
press release because you're also

662
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:38,150
excited that you got millions of dollars

663
00:27:35,829 --> 00:27:39,980
that you're then putting a flag in the

664
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:41,960
ground to tell both your local

665
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:43,009
jurisdiction if they say that you can't

666
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,960
transfer a license and by

667
00:27:43,009 --> 00:27:47,750
non-transferable sometimes they mean no

668
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:49,250
change of control so what exactly is the

669
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:50,839
big pharmaceutical company doing if

670
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:54,289
they're not buying equity in your

671
00:27:50,839 --> 00:27:55,609
business to change control and at the

672
00:27:54,289 --> 00:27:57,740
state level you're telling the state

673
00:27:55,609 --> 00:28:00,559
regulators oh this person's now an owner

674
00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:03,769
in fourteen days from now if I haven't

675
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:05,179
updated you and they're not added and

676
00:28:03,769 --> 00:28:07,759
they have equity no I've just

677
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:11,509
transferred a permit and now in a public

678
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:15,200
record I'm letting you know and these

679
00:28:11,509 --> 00:28:20,000
people by the way are owners and as an

680
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:23,779
owner anything that they do anything

681
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:26,650
they have a felony DUI all of a sudden

682
00:28:23,779 --> 00:28:29,299
that could jeopardize your license so I

683
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:31,160
implore you I get that there is more

684
00:28:29,299 --> 00:28:33,740
money than God

685
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:36,980
currently circling the cannabis space

686
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:39,200
being like I Nate just jump at all of

687
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:43,039
the money that I want to give you have a

688
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:45,440
plan understand how that plan is going

689
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:48,049
to be effectuated

690
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:52,100
and do not think it is that easy to

691
00:28:48,049 --> 00:28:55,279
bring people in to your business to your

692
00:28:52,099 --> 00:28:57,980
baby that you have slaved over and I am

693
00:28:55,279 --> 00:29:00,079
sure that you spent all of your

694
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:03,529
hard-earned capital and your dollars in

695
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:05,449
your time getting it to this place don't

696
00:29:03,529 --> 00:29:07,730
all of a sudden let that be squandered

697
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:09,110
or let somebody come in and take your

698
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:11,450
business on pennies on the dollar

699
00:29:09,109 --> 00:29:13,429
because I'm promising you good corporate

700
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:15,710
governance has not been the mainstay of

701
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:17,570
this business if you don't have good

702
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:19,430
corporate actions if you don't have a

703
00:29:17,569 --> 00:29:21,019
minute book if you don't have properly

704
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:22,970
filed statements of information and

705
00:29:21,019 --> 00:29:24,589
somebody else goes in and files one for

706
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:27,049
you and all the sudden takes over your

707
00:29:24,589 --> 00:29:29,509
company these are real-world things that

708
00:29:27,049 --> 00:29:32,029
are happening when there's assets and be

709
00:29:29,509 --> 00:29:34,819
forewarn the BCC is starting to crack

710
00:29:32,029 --> 00:29:36,889
down I've had this issue happen where if

711
00:29:34,819 --> 00:29:39,289
you improperly add an owner if you

712
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:41,390
improperly try to remove an owner or

713
00:29:39,289 --> 00:29:43,909
transfer around outside of the

714
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:48,290
regulations they will revoke your

715
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:49,850
license and that's not just one license

716
00:29:48,289 --> 00:29:52,460
your license is revoked

717
00:29:49,849 --> 00:29:54,049
therefore forever you are going to have

718
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:56,600
to write that your license was revoked

719
00:29:54,049 --> 00:30:00,740
and it could jeopardize your other

720
00:29:56,599 --> 00:30:03,469
existing licenses so I just think very

721
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:05,240
long and hard and strategically and talk

722
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:07,549
to your compliance people talk to your

723
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:09,920
lawyers talk to your tax professionals

724
00:30:07,549 --> 00:30:14,480
does there's tax implications about what

725
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:17,900
selling in air quotes that means or

726
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:19,190
taking in capital how do you do that but

727
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:20,840
you know we can go back to the

728
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:23,420
regulations I just felt like dovetailing

729
00:30:20,839 --> 00:30:25,519
off of what was your speech could not be

730
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:30,110
better it's just reminding people what

731
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:32,779
that transferability yes I mean in like

732
00:30:30,109 --> 00:30:34,699
we said it is a it's a living process

733
00:30:32,779 --> 00:30:36,799
and the permanent regulations are

734
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:38,450
permanent so we have there's there's

735
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:40,369
hopeful things there's hopeful things on

736
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:42,319
the horizon we're in the flurry of all

737
00:30:40,369 --> 00:30:45,049
of the bills at the legislative level

738
00:30:42,319 --> 00:30:47,029
being introduced senator scott weiner

739
00:30:45,049 --> 00:30:49,700
has reintroduced the compassionate care

740
00:30:47,029 --> 00:30:51,589
bill which is amazing let's hope that

741
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:53,809
this governor actually signs it because

742
00:30:51,589 --> 00:30:56,929
it did pass last year but

743
00:30:53,809 --> 00:30:59,720
didn't sign it this would relieve the

744
00:30:56,930 --> 00:31:03,350
excise taxes from donated products from

745
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:06,799
compassionate care that'd be nice we

746
00:31:03,349 --> 00:31:08,719
also have you know on another huh

747
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:10,279
oh yeah the excise tax bill is getting

748
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:13,069
reintroduced to lower the excise tax

749
00:31:10,279 --> 00:31:15,529
from 15 to 11% hey every little bit

750
00:31:13,069 --> 00:31:18,259
helps you have a lot of localities

751
00:31:15,529 --> 00:31:20,450
starting to lower their local taxes

752
00:31:18,259 --> 00:31:22,250
because they're getting the symbol I

753
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:24,289
mean they're getting the idea that maybe

754
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:26,000
the really high local taxes on top of

755
00:31:24,289 --> 00:31:27,500
low high with state taxes on top of a

756
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,089
high you know all of it doesn't really

757
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:31,039
work that well they're seeing the tax

758
00:31:29,089 --> 00:31:33,109
money the tax revenue is not staying

759
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:35,450
locally it's going straight to the state

760
00:31:33,109 --> 00:31:36,829
level and and this is where a lot of

761
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:39,380
this stuff is very frustrating to me is

762
00:31:36,829 --> 00:31:41,480
seen where what the fines are and what

763
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:43,520
the application fees are and what

764
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:48,740
communities can make off of these

765
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:50,900
application fees and Oh ton yeah 1.7

766
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:57,410
million in Pasadena well hot damn they

767
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:59,180
better for applications once you get

768
00:31:57,410 --> 00:32:02,450
your license they just made off of

769
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:04,009
people applying but at least is staying

770
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:05,450
at the local level so I appreciate that

771
00:32:04,009 --> 00:32:07,579
because that's money that's being pumped

772
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:11,539
in from all over the world is going in

773
00:32:07,579 --> 00:32:13,429
for these Pasadena applications the the

774
00:32:11,539 --> 00:32:15,889
dispensaries are not seeing the growth

775
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:18,380
that they had had projected to see the

776
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:20,780
only thing that has grown is their costs

777
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:22,850
for everything else and that's where it

778
00:32:20,779 --> 00:32:24,950
went back to like the packaging the CRP

779
00:32:22,849 --> 00:32:28,699
packaging this whole whiplash back and

780
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:30,410
forth situation here every time the the

781
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:33,049
government makes a decision like this

782
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:35,690
that they think is so small and so not a

783
00:32:33,049 --> 00:32:37,220
big insignificant ends up costing

784
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:40,400
millions of dollars costing companies

785
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:43,819
their jobs I mean they're costing people

786
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:45,170
their companies and and how are we going

787
00:32:43,819 --> 00:32:47,720
to survive through a lot of this stuff

788
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:51,650
here is and you have to be willing and

789
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:53,029
ready to pivot at every turn and and I

790
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:55,400
worked emergency veterinary medicine

791
00:32:53,029 --> 00:32:57,920
before I got into cannabis and we dealt

792
00:32:55,400 --> 00:33:01,170
with federally controlled drugs like we

793
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:03,900
regularly have ketamine out and

794
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:05,310
and hydromorphone and Valium and these

795
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:07,110
are things that have to be tracked every

796
00:33:05,309 --> 00:33:10,109
single month and I have to provide that

797
00:33:07,109 --> 00:33:12,299
to state and federal agencies and these

798
00:33:10,109 --> 00:33:14,399
are also organizations specifically vet

799
00:33:12,299 --> 00:33:16,409
clinics in Texas don't usually hire

800
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:18,930
veterinary technicians that are licensed

801
00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:20,730
so since there's Texas A&amp;M there which

802
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:24,690
is the largest vet school in the country

803
00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:27,720
and Texas is all about you know low

804
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:31,710
wages and best your ass that's why I

805
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:32,940
live in California now is you didn't

806
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:34,829
have to be credentialed anything and you

807
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:37,529
have people that are literally your

808
00:33:34,829 --> 00:33:38,809
veterinary license does that risk it's

809
00:33:37,529 --> 00:33:42,059
not just your business license your

810
00:33:38,809 --> 00:33:44,579
career is at risk because you have an

811
00:33:42,059 --> 00:33:46,470
employee who's skimming valium off the

812
00:33:44,579 --> 00:33:48,240
top or kind of mean off the top and I've

813
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:50,610
seen this come back on them and it's

814
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:53,430
like so I know what it's like to work in

815
00:33:50,609 --> 00:33:55,019
a highly regulated market with compliant

816
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:58,080
products that you have to track and

817
00:33:55,019 --> 00:34:00,210
trace every bit of it and you're leaving

818
00:33:58,079 --> 00:34:03,569
that trust in some of your employees

819
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:08,070
that are you know an experienced

820
00:34:03,569 --> 00:34:10,440
uneducated and and and not caring really

821
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:12,570
what makes a difference in your life you

822
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:14,010
know this or that and and you're not

823
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:15,870
taking care of them so I mean I think

824
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:18,780
this is where it's like truly it has to

825
00:34:15,869 --> 00:34:21,329
be we're not in the business of cannabis

826
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:23,640
we're in the compliance business which I

827
00:34:21,329 --> 00:34:25,289
mean I know I personally am but

828
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:26,670
everybody should be doing this right now

829
00:34:25,289 --> 00:34:28,230
it has to be part of your culture and

830
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:30,780
you need to bring people in and I'm not

831
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:32,130
pitching any of us here like there's

832
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:34,200
plenty of great companies out there

833
00:34:32,130 --> 00:34:35,579
great people out there and people that

834
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:37,559
have just been in the industry long

835
00:34:35,579 --> 00:34:39,210
enough that they know how to to go with

836
00:34:37,559 --> 00:34:40,349
these changes and you need to bring them

837
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:42,900
in and you need to listen to them

838
00:34:40,349 --> 00:34:44,579
because like I had a discussion earlier

839
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:48,809
it's like if you're dropping off samples

840
00:34:44,579 --> 00:34:50,099
in a store and you you know I know that

841
00:34:48,809 --> 00:34:51,029
there has to be a manifest in there all

842
00:34:50,099 --> 00:34:52,920
these things but it's like you're not

843
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:54,330
well they can go back for 90 days where

844
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:56,789
the footage and then they see you and

845
00:34:54,329 --> 00:34:58,289
then like oh they didn't also check in

846
00:34:56,789 --> 00:35:00,029
as a visitor so they're not on the

847
00:34:58,289 --> 00:35:02,880
visitor log so they may never find out

848
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:04,590
who the sales rep was they will because

849
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,210
of the harassing the store for saying

850
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:07,890
who was this and all this and then

851
00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:09,420
they'll go back to them and then your

852
00:35:07,889 --> 00:35:11,369
company is that risk because you had a

853
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:13,559
sales rep that was just trying to win

854
00:35:11,369 --> 00:35:15,309
that account because now you've switched

855
00:35:13,559 --> 00:35:18,219
them all from

856
00:35:15,309 --> 00:35:19,358
from commission-based - now they're over

857
00:35:18,219 --> 00:35:22,199
because you don't want to file them as a

858
00:35:19,358 --> 00:35:24,460
financial interest party on their so it

859
00:35:22,199 --> 00:35:28,029
it's has to take care of you people take

860
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:30,220
some time off from selling and train yes

861
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:31,390
and I just to pick up on that like I was

862
00:35:30,219 --> 00:35:33,639
just having this conversation with

863
00:35:31,389 --> 00:35:34,929
somebody where there's so many micro

864
00:35:33,639 --> 00:35:36,460
things and the companies where they're

865
00:35:34,929 --> 00:35:37,779
like this isn't a big deal and this

866
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:40,119
isn't a big deal this isn't a big deal

867
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:43,540
it may not even be something that you do

868
00:35:40,119 --> 00:35:46,240
your dispensary your business could be

869
00:35:43,539 --> 00:35:47,858
robbed and the police are gonna ask for

870
00:35:46,239 --> 00:35:49,959
the tapes and they're gonna review the

871
00:35:47,858 --> 00:35:51,639
tapes and then they see stuff happen and

872
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:53,289
this has happened where then they see

873
00:35:51,639 --> 00:35:55,210
something else happen again go oh by the

874
00:35:53,289 --> 00:35:56,559
way sorry about your robbery but look at

875
00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:59,530
all these things that you're doing wrong

876
00:35:56,559 --> 00:36:01,840
in your tapes so it's it's incredibly

877
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:04,769
different and difficult to be under this

878
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:07,510
level of scrutiny but if you can master

879
00:36:04,769 --> 00:36:09,880
being comfortable under this level of

880
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:11,500
scrutiny reporting everything having

881
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:14,680
those relationships with the agencies

882
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:16,059
just be being an open book you know for

883
00:36:14,679 --> 00:36:17,440
what they asked to see it's like going

884
00:36:16,059 --> 00:36:18,820
through a tax audit you show them what

885
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:22,389
they asked you to answer the questions

886
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:24,309
they ask and and on you go that's a

887
00:36:22,389 --> 00:36:25,989
great it's a great situation to be in

888
00:36:24,309 --> 00:36:29,349
it's a great muscle to cultivate and

889
00:36:25,989 --> 00:36:32,588
also what Brett was saying any company

890
00:36:29,349 --> 00:36:34,570
who hires a single compliance officer

891
00:36:32,588 --> 00:36:36,338
and is like we're good we're covered we

892
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:38,890
do we got compliance like I have a

893
00:36:36,338 --> 00:36:41,650
consultant we're great you're not okay

894
00:36:38,889 --> 00:36:45,699
like well - tough tell them what you're

895
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:48,730
saying everybody's job in a company in a

896
00:36:45,699 --> 00:36:51,368
cannabis company is now compliance you

897
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:53,889
are no longer a budtender your job is

898
00:36:51,369 --> 00:36:56,559
sales compliance you are no longer a

899
00:36:53,889 --> 00:37:00,029
grower your job is growing compliance

900
00:36:56,559 --> 00:37:02,219
you know you your growers have like a

901
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:04,570
ridiculous amount of record-keeping

902
00:37:02,219 --> 00:37:06,459
responsibilities you have to support

903
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:08,019
them you have to build systems that work

904
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:10,179
for them you have to make sure they have

905
00:37:08,019 --> 00:37:12,909
the right scales and the right kind of

906
00:37:10,179 --> 00:37:14,618
points of entry to enter the information

907
00:37:12,909 --> 00:37:16,779
so that it's not too hard and it's not

908
00:37:14,619 --> 00:37:18,099
too difficult and you're not giving them

909
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:19,720
so much pressure that they're in too

910
00:37:18,099 --> 00:37:21,760
much of a hurry that they can't write

911
00:37:19,719 --> 00:37:23,409
down the wet weight for every individual

912
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:25,990
plant that has to be written down now

913
00:37:23,409 --> 00:37:27,190
you have to help them and then you have

914
00:37:25,989 --> 00:37:29,769
to build in redundancy

915
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:31,780
big so that's the thing about it is is

916
00:37:29,769 --> 00:37:33,719
like not only do you have to do it you

917
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:35,890
got to do that like three fucking times

918
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:37,299
because you don't want any of this to go

919
00:37:35,889 --> 00:37:39,250
missing so if you have to keep a

920
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:40,180
visitor's log like a lot of people don't

921
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:41,710
understand that you have to keep

922
00:37:40,179 --> 00:37:42,879
employee records separate from other

923
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:44,230
records and all of this different

924
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,480
thinking so they'll have them all locked

925
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:48,369
up and in our spaces right now like I

926
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:50,369
mean compliance also means it takes up a

927
00:37:48,369 --> 00:37:52,269
lot of space so you have to have

928
00:37:50,369 --> 00:37:57,670
cabinets that are locked you have this

929
00:37:52,269 --> 00:38:00,849
you know and it's like well let's have

930
00:37:57,670 --> 00:38:02,740
digital digital is great until shit goes

931
00:38:00,849 --> 00:38:04,569
down and then you don't have electricity

932
00:38:02,739 --> 00:38:06,339
and then they just so happen to show up

933
00:38:04,570 --> 00:38:07,870
in that moment and the thing about all

934
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:09,130
of this is and with regulators and I

935
00:38:07,869 --> 00:38:11,500
don't mean this in a bad way is like

936
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:13,390
learn how to be this is funny coming

937
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:16,300
from with me for me learn how to be a

938
00:38:13,389 --> 00:38:22,629
likeable person because all of this

939
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:23,830
stuff is oh it's like subjective like so

940
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:24,309
if they come in and they don't like your

941
00:38:23,829 --> 00:38:26,440
attitude

942
00:38:24,309 --> 00:38:28,960
those other two things that they didn't

943
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:31,750
that they saw but they didn't see they

944
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:33,579
saw and so you need to learn how to also

945
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:35,889
come at this because they're coming at

946
00:38:33,579 --> 00:38:38,319
you nice as can be because they know

947
00:38:35,889 --> 00:38:40,179
that takes your guard down so you need

948
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:42,970
to come at them nicest can be as well

949
00:38:40,179 --> 00:38:44,589
and have like like it was already

950
00:38:42,969 --> 00:38:46,839
discussed here it's like I do just like

951
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:49,480
a fire drill not that any businesses do

952
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:52,090
that but do a fire drill because trust

953
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:55,780
me that fire will burn you down worse we

954
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:57,700
we do so I not not to pitch the business

955
00:38:55,780 --> 00:39:00,010
but we do it Julie does that other

956
00:38:57,699 --> 00:39:02,199
people do it we go and do an audit of

957
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:05,230
our clients businesses we give them

958
00:39:02,199 --> 00:39:08,289
anywhere from 48 hours to two hours to

959
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:11,440
zero notice and we show up and I show up

960
00:39:08,289 --> 00:39:15,539
and I'm like okay so today I'm your BCC

961
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:17,800
auditor show me what your books are

962
00:39:15,539 --> 00:39:19,480
check me in and if they don't track me

963
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:22,330
and I said why aren't you asking for my

964
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:24,579
ID do it where is your visitor a lot and

965
00:39:22,329 --> 00:39:28,090
I tell you it's those sorts of

966
00:39:24,579 --> 00:39:31,420
unannounced audits that prepare you and

967
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:33,100
your staff the best because what Brett

968
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:35,860
is saying which really thing is you got

969
00:39:33,099 --> 00:39:38,769
a these are usually enforcement officers

970
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:39,380
or former police officers they know how

971
00:39:38,769 --> 00:39:41,960
to add

972
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:44,210
leading questions they know how to be

973
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:45,889
nicest pie so that all the sudden your

974
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:48,349
employees talking and they're like oh

975
00:39:45,889 --> 00:39:50,118
yeah well you know sometimes I put it in

976
00:39:48,349 --> 00:39:51,798
and sometimes they don't and if we're

977
00:39:50,119 --> 00:39:53,568
really busy then I'll wait till do it

978
00:39:51,798 --> 00:39:56,358
until later and then they're not in real

979
00:39:53,568 --> 00:39:58,489
time and they're just talking so they

980
00:39:56,358 --> 00:40:00,409
need to understand how to answer

981
00:39:58,489 --> 00:40:02,479
questions how to give the correct

982
00:40:00,409 --> 00:40:04,338
information without giving more

983
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:08,960
information than they have to

984
00:40:04,338 --> 00:40:11,000
and it's practice makes perfect right

985
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:13,278
nobody is ever a hundred percent

986
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,440
compliant I like to look at this

987
00:40:13,278 --> 00:40:17,509
industry the same as a banking industry

988
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:20,929
right banks are heavily regulated

989
00:40:17,509 --> 00:40:23,028
industry and when the federal reserve

990
00:40:20,929 --> 00:40:24,710
comes in no bank is ever a hundred

991
00:40:23,028 --> 00:40:25,818
percent compliant but there are some

992
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:28,278
banks that work with third-party

993
00:40:25,818 --> 00:40:30,230
certification companies and they have a

994
00:40:28,278 --> 00:40:32,599
certification that says we were last

995
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:34,730
audited on X date these are the issues

996
00:40:32,599 --> 00:40:36,470
that they found these are the corrective

997
00:40:34,730 --> 00:40:37,940
actions we already have in place

998
00:40:36,469 --> 00:40:40,338
and I tell you when the Federal Reserve

999
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:43,099
comes in to do an audit they may not

1000
00:40:40,338 --> 00:40:45,288
give you they may not give those banks

1001
00:40:43,099 --> 00:40:46,789
additional fines because what are what

1002
00:40:45,289 --> 00:40:48,799
is a fine the finest to identify a

1003
00:40:46,789 --> 00:40:50,960
problem and to ensure that there's a

1004
00:40:48,798 --> 00:40:52,699
corrective action and remediation so

1005
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:54,650
that it doesn't happen again if you've

1006
00:40:52,699 --> 00:40:56,868
already done those three things there's

1007
00:40:54,650 --> 00:40:59,358
not much for the agency to do and they'd

1008
00:40:56,869 --> 00:41:01,519
rather let you continue on and say okay

1009
00:40:59,358 --> 00:41:03,679
well then I'm gonna come back and make

1010
00:41:01,518 --> 00:41:05,689
sure these things have been done or they

1011
00:41:03,679 --> 00:41:07,969
may impose a date by which they have to

1012
00:41:05,690 --> 00:41:09,559
be done versus the corrective action

1013
00:41:07,969 --> 00:41:13,159
that you had that allowed you a longer

1014
00:41:09,559 --> 00:41:15,230
bandwidth so that you had more financial

1015
00:41:13,159 --> 00:41:17,078
security in making those changes so they

1016
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:19,400
may instead just escalate your timetable

1017
00:41:17,079 --> 00:41:22,220
versus giving you an enforcement action

1018
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:23,720
so nobody up here is saying that we want

1019
00:41:22,219 --> 00:41:25,278
to go in and tell you what you're doing

1020
00:41:23,719 --> 00:41:27,919
wrong like I said before we want to

1021
00:41:25,278 --> 00:41:29,989
highlight what you can do better so that

1022
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:32,509
when those agencies come it's not a

1023
00:41:29,989 --> 00:41:34,818
surprise to you well and I think that a

1024
00:41:32,509 --> 00:41:39,048
lot of this compliance also any other

1025
00:41:34,818 --> 00:41:41,989
sounds completely not true at all but a

1026
00:41:39,048 --> 00:41:45,170
lot of this can aid in efficiency and

1027
00:41:41,989 --> 00:41:47,629
cost savings because you're streamlining

1028
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:48,980
what you're doing this is what large

1029
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:50,539
companies do and this is where the

1030
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:51,740
pharmaceutical companies can come in

1031
00:41:50,539 --> 00:41:52,500
here and I can they can read our

1032
00:41:51,739 --> 00:41:53,969
regulation

1033
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:55,380
the tobacco industry can come in here

1034
00:41:53,969 --> 00:41:57,419
and read our regulations and be like I

1035
00:41:55,380 --> 00:42:00,480
got this because they already know what

1036
00:41:57,420 --> 00:42:02,400
it's like to reside in that and and they

1037
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:03,960
know that areas that they can strategize

1038
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,910
on because a lot of these things are is

1039
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:08,099
just like oh it says I can't do this

1040
00:42:05,909 --> 00:42:10,019
it did not say you couldn't do that it

1041
00:42:08,099 --> 00:42:10,380
said you couldn't do it the way you did

1042
00:42:10,019 --> 00:42:12,750
it

1043
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:16,170
now you can figure out ways to go around

1044
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:19,199
it and I you know there's nothing more

1045
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:20,820
than I love to see is like as a kid like

1046
00:42:19,199 --> 00:42:22,439
you know it's like you didn't want to do

1047
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:24,450
what your mom or dad told you to do so

1048
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:26,309
you like to figure a way around it to

1049
00:42:24,449 --> 00:42:28,049
get what you wanted and like this is

1050
00:42:26,309 --> 00:42:31,199
kind of what regulations are to me as

1051
00:42:28,050 --> 00:42:33,330
well and and and and thank God like I'm

1052
00:42:31,199 --> 00:42:34,649
coming from a place of ethics versus

1053
00:42:33,329 --> 00:42:37,380
some people are coming from a place of

1054
00:42:34,650 --> 00:42:39,809
greed and selfishness and whatever and

1055
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:43,800
yes I'm sure my husband would say I do

1056
00:42:39,809 --> 00:42:45,360
that every so often too but you need to

1057
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:48,510
go through there and just strategize

1058
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:51,030
allow yourself to wipe out what you used

1059
00:42:48,510 --> 00:42:52,770
to think that it meant and try to go

1060
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:53,880
from there because a lot of these things

1061
00:42:52,769 --> 00:42:56,610
they just help you streamline your

1062
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:58,710
business streamline your finances I am a

1063
00:42:56,610 --> 00:43:01,110
huge believer in that the green tax is

1064
00:42:58,710 --> 00:43:02,909
not 90 percent of the time the green tax

1065
00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:04,530
is up you're late and you should have

1066
00:43:02,909 --> 00:43:06,029
got this shit in it's three weeks ago

1067
00:43:04,530 --> 00:43:09,180
and that's why you're paying the extra

1068
00:43:06,030 --> 00:43:11,370
fee on all this stuff but I'm also

1069
00:43:09,179 --> 00:43:12,509
noticing more and more now like security

1070
00:43:11,369 --> 00:43:14,339
companies are really wanting to get

1071
00:43:12,510 --> 00:43:17,040
involved in this I mean now that things

1072
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:19,070
are legal on a on a state level we've

1073
00:43:17,039 --> 00:43:21,480
been able to actually have access to

1074
00:43:19,070 --> 00:43:23,519
better companies to work with and

1075
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:25,230
they're not as you know I used to be so

1076
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:27,090
worried to divulge it oh this is a

1077
00:43:25,230 --> 00:43:30,570
retailer or this is you know this is our

1078
00:43:27,090 --> 00:43:32,370
dispensary and now it's it's so much

1079
00:43:30,570 --> 00:43:34,970
better people are less less judgmental

1080
00:43:32,369 --> 00:43:37,170
about it but I also still remember how

1081
00:43:34,969 --> 00:43:39,299
dispensaries act when the fire and

1082
00:43:37,170 --> 00:43:40,889
safety show up before all of this and

1083
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:42,450
and to just come in and either yearly

1084
00:43:40,889 --> 00:43:44,309
inspection like they just have to walk

1085
00:43:42,449 --> 00:43:45,509
through the place and you would stop

1086
00:43:44,309 --> 00:43:47,099
them at the front and you'd be like no

1087
00:43:45,510 --> 00:43:50,160
no no you can't come in until I'm like

1088
00:43:47,099 --> 00:43:51,690
no I literally have to like it in if

1089
00:43:50,159 --> 00:43:53,219
that's how they acted with fire safety

1090
00:43:51,690 --> 00:43:54,809
who these guys were like I don't really

1091
00:43:53,219 --> 00:43:58,259
care like I'll come through like I'm

1092
00:43:54,809 --> 00:44:00,119
I'll wait you know the these inspectors

1093
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:01,740
and auditors are not gonna sit there and

1094
00:44:00,119 --> 00:44:03,750
wait because that adds

1095
00:44:01,739 --> 00:44:07,019
you there day anyways is there gonna

1096
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:08,880
still do what they got to do it's a

1097
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:12,059
fight that's we all are fine to not let

1098
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:15,329
the men are immediately regs do you guys

1099
00:44:12,059 --> 00:44:17,009

00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:24,260
