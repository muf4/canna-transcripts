2
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:21,929
so the question essentially was common

3
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:24,359
practice moving into old rose

4
00:00:21,929 --> 00:00:28,670
greenhouses things like that with dirt

5
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:31,019
floors so the problem with that is

6
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:32,759
whether we wanted to or not nature is

7
00:00:31,018 --> 00:00:34,710
still functioning so if there's dirt in

8
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:37,079
this greenhouse nature is and still is

9
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:41,100
functioning and the organisms in the

10
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:43,969
soil are very specific so they operate

11
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:47,189
at specific ranges of oxygen specific

12
00:00:43,969 --> 00:00:49,350
moisture levels things like that and so

13
00:00:47,189 --> 00:00:51,570
when the conditions in the soil are

14
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:54,239
ideal for their growth proliferation and

15
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:56,820
activity that is what determines what is

16
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:59,549
functioning and performing functions of

17
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:01,350
nature at all times and so in these old

18
00:00:59,549 --> 00:01:03,569
houses they've been chemically bombed

19
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:05,159
and so those residuals of chemicals in

20
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:07,228
the soil that are being pulled up and

21
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:09,600
can be pulled up into the plant which I

22
00:01:07,228 --> 00:01:12,709
understand is and can lead to test

23
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:15,329
failures and then just the presence of

24
00:01:12,709 --> 00:01:17,188
the spores of these organisms because

25
00:01:15,329 --> 00:01:19,618
the ground of that green house has been

26
00:01:17,188 --> 00:01:22,529
compacted anaerobic and full of disease

27
00:01:19,618 --> 00:01:24,599
spores for who knows how long and so

28
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:25,590
it's not it's not a mountain that we

29
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:28,408
can't overcome we just have to

30
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:30,359
understand how that system is working so

31
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:33,090
if we know and can understand that these

32
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:34,890
biological organisms are specialized we

33
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:36,630
can create the conditions that make it

34
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:40,439
not ideal for them to proliferate or

35
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:42,239
even function or be viable and it's not

36
00:01:40,438 --> 00:01:44,398
uncommon when you're scanning a

37
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:46,469
coverslip with a microscope slide that

38
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:49,228
you see spores a Fusarium and Alternaria

39
00:01:46,469 --> 00:01:51,179
and all these fungal pathogens they are

40
00:01:49,228 --> 00:01:53,429
there naturally in nature in their

41
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:54,960
dormant phase for when conditions are

42
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:57,719
ideal for them to proliferate and

43
00:01:54,959 --> 00:02:01,408
perform their function in nature and so

44
00:01:57,718 --> 00:02:03,269
in a extremely healthy vibrant soil it's

45
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:05,969
not uncommon to see spores and Fusarium

46
00:02:03,269 --> 00:02:07,560
crosses across the street and you only

47
00:02:05,968 --> 00:02:09,810
become concerned when they're in

48
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,900
I populations because it shows that

49
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:14,670
they're making spores and so if we can

50
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,950
change the conditions in that soil we

51
00:02:14,669 --> 00:02:18,869
can we can put those organisms to sleep

52
00:02:16,949 --> 00:02:20,549
put them into dormant phases and dispose

53
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:22,530
of them literally and that's how nature

54
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:26,250
does it but we have to change those

55
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:28,199
conditions and they're not an overcomer

56
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:30,300
bowl but then you become running into

57
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:31,979
more problems now that you're in a

58
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,780
greenhouse with glass and all these

59
00:02:31,979 --> 00:02:36,209
things that's like a foreign language so

60
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:36,629
I don't want to really try to break it

61
00:02:36,209 --> 00:02:38,939
down

62
00:02:36,629 --> 00:02:42,299
I'll let Jonathan handle that but then

63
00:02:38,939 --> 00:02:44,250
you're running into more problems and we

64
00:02:42,299 --> 00:02:46,349
we make a joke when people ask us how do

65
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:47,849
we retrofit these old greenhouses and

66
00:02:46,349 --> 00:02:50,909
growing them and say you don't you put

67
00:02:47,849 --> 00:02:52,560
PVC hoop houses you pull tarps and you

68
00:02:50,909 --> 00:02:54,359
go by an appropriate facility you know

69
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,759
it doesn't have disease and will be

70
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:59,580
ideal so one of the things I see most

71
00:02:56,759 --> 00:03:01,500
often because I'm analyzing the soil of

72
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:02,790
different growing styles indoor/outdoor

73
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:06,030
greenhouses different types of

74
00:03:02,789 --> 00:03:07,650
greenhouses we can see very clearly how

75
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:09,269
those environments are negatively

76
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:12,060
impacting the soil which is driving

77
00:03:09,269 --> 00:03:14,039
pests and disease pressure and it's

78
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:15,840
coming from the environmental aspect

79
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:17,969
because we're using the inappropriate

80
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,670
greenhouse structures and all that

81
00:03:17,969 --> 00:03:22,650
business but really you know we're

82
00:03:20,669 --> 00:03:24,659
creating a hostile environment that

83
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:26,430
hostile environment dictates a hostile

84
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:28,500
soil environment and then when that

85
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:30,569
happens the good organisms go to sleep

86
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,919
in the bag orgasms wake up you can

87
00:03:30,568 --> 00:03:34,589
mitigate those but then you're still

88
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:36,298
fighting a hostile environment and we

89
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:37,920
can change the conditions in the soil to

90
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:41,430
be more ideal for vigorous plant growth

91
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:43,578
and lower disease pressure but then

92
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:46,139
you're still fighting environments and

93
00:03:43,579 --> 00:03:48,269
we can see that very clearly when we

94
00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:50,250
analyze the different groups of plants

95
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:52,709
individually amongst the green house or

96
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:54,870
the space and you can actually see in

97
00:03:52,709 --> 00:03:57,509
the back corner by the wet walls there's

98
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:59,009
an increase in humidity which is

99
00:03:57,509 --> 00:04:00,689
negatively affecting the natural

100
00:03:59,009 --> 00:04:04,199
respiration of the moisture in the soil

101
00:04:00,689 --> 00:04:07,318
in those pots when that condition is

102
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:09,568
created in the soil that selects for

103
00:04:07,318 --> 00:04:11,818
organisms that produce nitrates these

104
00:04:09,568 --> 00:04:15,119
anaerobic organisms nitrates are fine

105
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:17,279
for vegetative and vigorous growth but

106
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,590
as you move into flowering

107
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:21,298
you have to lower the nitrates and bring

108
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:23,219
in the ammoniacal nitrogen if you look

109
00:04:21,298 --> 00:04:25,019
on the back of any bottle of nutrients

110
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:26,550
you see this happen with the percentages

111
00:04:25,019 --> 00:04:28,859
and the types of nutrients that are

112
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:31,110
happening so this increased humidity

113
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:32,939
whether it's whether it's VPD and doors

114
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:36,030
are running high heat high humidity it

115
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:38,310
is stifling that soil surface and it's

116
00:04:36,029 --> 00:04:40,289
creating these conditions ideal for

117
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:42,600
organisms that produce nitrates when

118
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:44,970
nitrates exceed fifty five percent of

119
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,770
plant SAP you end up with sucking pests

120
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:49,380
like as a function of math and nature

121
00:04:46,769 --> 00:04:51,629
and so in the back corners of these

122
00:04:49,379 --> 00:04:53,310
hostile environments or up against the

123
00:04:51,629 --> 00:04:54,930
other end wall with the smaller plants

124
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:56,819
that we don't want growing into the

125
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:58,590
controls and the doors they're getting

126
00:04:56,819 --> 00:05:00,300
the same dosage of water so they're

127
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:01,679
being over watered every day they're up

128
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,750
against a solid and while they're in the

129
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,310
shade they're slow growers that is the

130
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:11,100
conditions for pest and disease pressure

131
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:13,680
and so when we when we individually

132
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:15,419
count all these these beds or pots or

133
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,300
groups of plants we can look at it and

134
00:05:15,418 --> 00:05:20,490
we can see in the corners where the

135
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,600
problem is located and address it by

136
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:25,769
either changing environmental conditions

137
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:27,960
and changing a process almost everybody

138
00:05:25,769 --> 00:05:31,079
is brewing a tea that it selects for

139
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:33,329
disease biologically speaking so that

140
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:35,839
creates more populations of pests and

141
00:05:33,329 --> 00:05:35,839
disease pressure

142
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:54,399
