1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,459
why don't we get started here thanks

2
00:00:02,339 --> 00:00:07,559
everyone for joining us today uh my name

3
00:00:05,459 --> 00:00:09,359
is Brian hesterman with Inspire and I'll

4
00:00:07,559 --> 00:00:11,638
be hosting today's webinar and Q a

5
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:13,259
session uh we're here today to talk

6
00:00:11,638 --> 00:00:15,359
about mechanical systems for indoor

7
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:17,100
plant environments and as the title

8
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:18,800
suggests growing cannabis inside a

9
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,880
sealed room is a highly complex

10
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,859
interdisciplinary challenge that Bridges

11
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:24,778
engineering with Biology

12
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:27,060
we're adding and removing energy inside

13
00:00:24,778 --> 00:00:28,920
these cultivation rooms to balance and

14
00:00:27,059 --> 00:00:31,618
optimize the growth of living organisms

15
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,239
in our case cannabis plants whose needs

16
00:00:31,618 --> 00:00:34,738
are constantly changing

17
00:00:33,238 --> 00:00:37,019
and through the lens of increased

18
00:00:34,738 --> 00:00:39,479
competition price compression and

19
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:41,280
shifting consumer preferences carefully

20
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:42,898
designing the facility will determine

21
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,239
the success or failure of today's

22
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:47,280
cultivators

23
00:00:45,238 --> 00:00:49,320
it truly takes a village to build a high

24
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,539
performing cultivation facility and for

25
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,920
that reason we have a diverse audience

26
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:55,760
in attendance today

27
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:58,679
Architects Engineers contractors

28
00:00:55,759 --> 00:01:00,718
cultivators owners investors consultants

29
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:03,000
and the network of Channel Partners we

30
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,579
collaborate with every day

31
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,379
today's presentation is part one of a

32
00:01:05,579 --> 00:01:09,239
two-part series and will be focused on

33
00:01:07,379 --> 00:01:10,500
the biology side of the equation the

34
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:12,658
plant

35
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:14,640
this will be new content for some and

36
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:16,500
review for others and we'll do our best

37
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,079
to lay a solid foundation of plant

38
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:21,959
science Concepts dynamics of a sealed

39
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:24,000
grow room an hvacd system sizing and

40
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:25,739
selection with the overall goal of

41
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,840
building better facilities and growing

42
00:01:25,739 --> 00:01:30,298
better cannabis more efficiently

43
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,460
a couple of quick housekeeping items

44
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:34,618
part two will be on the mechanical

45
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:36,959
systems and cannabis specific sequence

46
00:01:34,618 --> 00:01:38,519
of operations that we apply to optimize

47
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:40,919
the plants inside these cultivation

48
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:43,259
facilities we'll also talk through

49
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,640
setting baselines and expectations for

50
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:47,159
an application that doesn't currently

51
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,659
have any today's webinar will be

52
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:50,899
presented by inspires cannabis

53
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:53,520
operations specialist Anders Peterson

54
00:01:50,899 --> 00:01:56,040
inspires Adrian giovanco will be joining

55
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:57,840
for Q a after the presentation without

56
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:00,659
further Ado I'll pass the mic over to

57
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:03,359
Durst take it away my man

58
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:06,420
thanks Brian uh hi everyone thanks for

59
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:08,118
joining me today in today's discussion

60
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:11,038
um my name is Anders Peterson

61
00:02:08,118 --> 00:02:13,318
affectionately referred to as durs by a

62
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:15,059
lot of my friends and colleagues I'm a

63
00:02:13,318 --> 00:02:16,859
biologist and have been working in the

64
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:20,580
Cannabis industry for almost 12 years

65
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:22,980
now with a focus on indoor cultivation

66
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:25,440
in part one of this webinar I wanted to

67
00:02:22,979 --> 00:02:27,659
share with you some of the Core Concepts

68
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:29,878
about mechanical systems for indoor

69
00:02:27,659 --> 00:02:31,799
plant environments that I wish I knew

70
00:02:29,878 --> 00:02:32,818
was a cultivator at the beginning of my

71
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,280
career

72
00:02:32,818 --> 00:02:38,098
but there's really no easy way around it

73
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,719
some of these are complicated topics and

74
00:02:38,098 --> 00:02:40,439
there's even going to be a little bit of

75
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:42,598
math

76
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:44,400
so I'm going to try my best to simplify

77
00:02:42,598 --> 00:02:46,259
everything and break it down over the

78
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,939
next 30 minutes or so

79
00:02:46,259 --> 00:02:50,039
and I encourage you to reach out to us

80
00:02:47,939 --> 00:02:52,199
here at Inspire if you have follow-up

81
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:54,979
questions or want to learn more about a

82
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:54,979
particular topic

83
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:59,339
so setting the stage a little bit this

84
00:02:57,419 --> 00:03:03,500
Talk's going to focus on environmental

85
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:03,500
control for indoor cultivation

86
00:03:04,259 --> 00:03:08,639
not greenhouses

87
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:10,620
many of the concepts still apply to

88
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:12,839
greenhouses but they have their own

89
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:14,819
unique considerations

90
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,920
keep in mind too as we go through this

91
00:03:14,818 --> 00:03:18,780
talk that these are tightly sealed Grow

92
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:20,299
rooms with no outdoor air being

93
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:22,739
introduced to normal operation

94
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:24,900
everything is fully recirculating

95
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:27,120
because we are also supplementing CO2

96
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:29,280
into these spaces

97
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,620
and finally our talk today will focus on

98
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,378
the cultivation of cannabis but again

99
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:36,900
these Concepts can apply to pretty much

100
00:03:34,378 --> 00:03:41,060
any crop grown indoors with their own

101
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:41,060
you know unique specie considerations

102
00:03:44,219 --> 00:03:47,818
so let's quickly review the main

103
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:50,400
parameters of plant growth that we're

104
00:03:47,818 --> 00:03:52,619
trying to control in these facilities in

105
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,500
one way or another your HVAC system

106
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:57,480
impacts everything you see here in the

107
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:01,259
shoot Zone we have light temperature

108
00:03:57,479 --> 00:04:04,139
humidity CO2 and airflow and in the root

109
00:04:01,259 --> 00:04:05,759
Zone water oxygen root Zone temperature

110
00:04:04,139 --> 00:04:08,219
and nutrients

111
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:10,378
microbes as well while not essential for

112
00:04:08,219 --> 00:04:12,598
plant growth they should be considered

113
00:04:10,378 --> 00:04:14,399
with their ubiquity in our environment

114
00:04:12,598 --> 00:04:16,500
and last but not least running down the

115
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,139
center of that plant is genetics the

116
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:23,040
foundation of everything genotype plus

117
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:25,319
environment equals phenotype or in other

118
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,600
words the genetics just represent the

119
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:29,399
potential of a certain variety the

120
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,320
better the environment to control the

121
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:32,519
better the phenotypic expression at the

122
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:33,719
end of the day

123
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:35,639
if you want to learn more about

124
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,560
phenotypic expression we actually have a

125
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:40,379
whole webinar dedicated to this topic on

126
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:41,759
our website and I believe Brian's going

127
00:04:40,379 --> 00:04:43,500
to drop it into the chat if you'd like

128
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,900
to check it out

129
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:48,779
now none of these parameters exist in a

130
00:04:45,899 --> 00:04:51,000
vacuum they all work synergistically the

131
00:04:48,779 --> 00:04:53,339
plant's Health growth rate and yield

132
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,860
depends on which of these parameters is

133
00:04:53,339 --> 00:04:57,659
its greatest limiting factor this

134
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:59,819
concept is called the law of the minimum

135
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:03,060
and it's often depicted by this Barrel

136
00:04:59,819 --> 00:05:05,040
here leaking water or yield on the right

137
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:06,899
essentially you are only as strong as

138
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,699
your weakest link like the shortest

139
00:05:06,899 --> 00:05:10,918
Stave in the barrel

140
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:13,020
and for each species of plant there are

141
00:05:10,918 --> 00:05:14,939
Optimum targets and ranges for each of

142
00:05:13,019 --> 00:05:16,859
these parameters to maximize the plant's

143
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:18,540
growth rate and yield and in these

144
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:20,699
Optimum conditions change as the plant

145
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:23,220
develops from a young vegetative plant

146
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:24,960
to a mature flowering plant and some of

147
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:27,300
these parameters the optimum condition

148
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:28,799
can change on hourly or minute by minute

149
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:31,680
basis

150
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:34,620
compared to growing plants Outdoors or

151
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,478
in greenhouses a Grower's ability to

152
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:39,240
control and optimize these parameters

153
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:41,579
indoors is exponentially greater and you

154
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:43,500
can really push plants to their limit

155
00:05:41,579 --> 00:05:46,379
you know cannabis is quite an amazing

156
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:48,360
plant it will grow like a Toyota Camry

157
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:50,699
if you treat it as such or it can

158
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:53,100
perform like a V12 Ferrari depending on

159
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:55,139
how hard you push it and can dial in and

160
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:57,780
control these parameters

161
00:05:55,139 --> 00:06:00,000
and so much like this law of minimum for

162
00:05:57,779 --> 00:06:02,698
plant growth the productivity of an

163
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,918
indoor facility is determined by its

164
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:06,780
greatest limiting factor as well or its

165
00:06:04,918 --> 00:06:08,639
most underperforming system

166
00:06:06,779 --> 00:06:10,679
and in my experience the greatest

167
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,180
limiting factor for most indoor

168
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:15,000
facilities today is their mechanical

169
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:17,038
systems or their ability to control the

170
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,139
temperature and humidity of their rooms

171
00:06:17,038 --> 00:06:21,120
not very long ago I would have said the

172
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:23,759
greatest limiting factor was lighting

173
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,978
but with the advances in LED technology

174
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,120
I just don't think that's that's the

175
00:06:25,978 --> 00:06:29,038
case anymore

176
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,660
and that the Improvement of mechanical

177
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:33,000
systems presents the greatest

178
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:35,520
opportunity to maximize the productivity

179
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,379
of indoor cultivation businesses

180
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:39,538
and this is exactly why Inspire was

181
00:06:37,379 --> 00:06:42,120
founded to develop purpose-built systems

182
00:06:39,538 --> 00:06:46,459
and controls that are at assets and

183
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:46,459
tools for Growers and not a liability

184
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:51,360
so to maximize the growth rate of a

185
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:53,818
plant we must maximize the rate of two

186
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,080
main plant processes photosynthesis and

187
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:57,060
transpiration

188
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:57,959
I think it's pretty safe to assume that

189
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:00,180
most of you are familiar with

190
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:02,219
photosynthesis the conversion of light

191
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:04,800
energy into chemical energy in the form

192
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:06,660
of sugar so I want to focus a bit on

193
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,939
transpiration

194
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:11,520
so transpiration is the movement of

195
00:07:08,939 --> 00:07:13,918
water and nutrients from the roots

196
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:16,379
through the shoots and then to the

197
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:19,079
leaves where the water then evaporates

198
00:07:16,379 --> 00:07:22,259
from the liquid to a gaseous Vapor about

199
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:23,758
97 to 99 of the water a plant absorbs

200
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:25,740
through its roots is lost through

201
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,240
transpiration and gets added to the air

202
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:29,460
as water vapor

203
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:30,960
so therefore transpiration is the

204
00:07:29,459 --> 00:07:33,598
primary source of humidity being

205
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:35,159
generated in a sealed grow room that a

206
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:36,598
mechanical system must remove by

207
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:39,360
dehumidification

208
00:07:36,598 --> 00:07:42,060
and transpiration photosynthesis are

209
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,460
separate processes but are intrinsically

210
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:47,098
linked since they are both regulated by

211
00:07:44,459 --> 00:07:49,739
the opening and closing of the stomata

212
00:07:47,098 --> 00:07:51,779
which are little pores found on the

213
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:53,759
underside of the leaves that have the

214
00:07:51,779 --> 00:07:55,739
ability to open or close depending on

215
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:59,639
the environment and are where all the

216
00:07:55,740 --> 00:08:02,579
gas exchange occurs so CO2 enters while

217
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:05,879
oxygen and water vapor escape

218
00:08:02,579 --> 00:08:07,978
as water evaporates from this stomodo

219
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:09,899
cavity there's what's called a net

220
00:08:07,978 --> 00:08:12,478
cooling effect

221
00:08:09,899 --> 00:08:14,758
as these molecules evaporate they are

222
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:17,339
taking heat energy with them and the

223
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:19,800
result is a cooler Leaf surface than the

224
00:08:17,339 --> 00:08:21,659
air around it and you can measure the

225
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,819
leaf surface temperature

226
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:25,800
and if the leaf temperature is cooler

227
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:29,039
than the air around it it generally

228
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:31,740
means the plant is actively transpiring

229
00:08:29,038 --> 00:08:34,500
for example an LED flowering rooms the

230
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:36,778
leaf temperature is generally three to

231
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:38,940
five degrees cooler than the air around

232
00:08:36,778 --> 00:08:40,679
it during the lights on period because

233
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:42,959
of this net cooling effect of

234
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:45,599
transpiration

235
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:49,919
and the rate or speed of transpiration

236
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:52,860
can change it can be fast slow or stop

237
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:55,799
altogether depending on pest pathogen

238
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:58,440
pressure the amount of Light how much

239
00:08:55,799 --> 00:09:00,838
water is in the root Zone if the stomata

240
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:03,300
are open or closed and the combination

241
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:06,680
of temperature and relative humidity or

242
00:09:03,299 --> 00:09:06,679
what's called VPD

243
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:12,299
so transpiration this process of water

244
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:13,860
going upwards into the plant is not

245
00:09:12,299 --> 00:09:16,500
going to happen on its own there's no

246
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:18,180
magical plant pumping mechanism to force

247
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:20,278
water up through its stock

248
00:09:18,179 --> 00:09:22,620
instead the water is actually drawn up

249
00:09:20,278 --> 00:09:24,419
through the plant by the environment and

250
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:25,799
the vapor pressure deficit around the

251
00:09:24,419 --> 00:09:29,219
leaves

252
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:31,740
VPD typically measured in kilopascals or

253
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:34,379
kPa is the pressure the environment

254
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:35,759
places on the leaves to draw water and

255
00:09:34,379 --> 00:09:37,379
nutrients the upper part of the plant

256
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:40,679
where it can then escape from the

257
00:09:37,379 --> 00:09:42,720
stomata as a vapor I think of this VPD

258
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:44,399
pressure like the pressure you create

259
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,899
with your mouth when you're drinking

260
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,299
through a straw

261
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:50,458
technically speaking VPD is the

262
00:09:48,299 --> 00:09:52,259
difference between the amount of

263
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:54,539
moisture in the air and how much

264
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:56,039
moisture the air can hold when it is 100

265
00:09:54,539 --> 00:09:58,019
saturated

266
00:09:56,039 --> 00:10:00,360
you can visualize this on What's called

267
00:09:58,019 --> 00:10:02,519
the psychometric chart like the one here

268
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:05,879
on the bottom left by plotting the room

269
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:07,860
conditions and the leaf temperature and

270
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:10,019
then subtracting the associated Vapor

271
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:11,700
pressures of each condition to get the

272
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:14,159
deficit

273
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:15,778
there's an optimal range for VPD

274
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:18,958
depending on the stage of growth the

275
00:10:15,778 --> 00:10:21,360
plant is in and generally for cannabis

276
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:24,299
from propagation to harvest we are

277
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,879
talking a range of between 0.5 and 1.5

278
00:10:24,299 --> 00:10:28,379
kPa shown in that table there in the

279
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:30,659
center

280
00:10:28,379 --> 00:10:32,939
so with a high VPD

281
00:10:30,659 --> 00:10:35,399
the air is really dry and has lots of

282
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:37,140
room to accept more moisture so the

283
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:38,940
water in the stomata will want to

284
00:10:37,139 --> 00:10:41,639
evaporate to an area of lower

285
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:43,440
concentration and the transpiration rate

286
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:44,939
and water Demand on the plant will

287
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,399
increase

288
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:49,019
with a low VPD the air around the leaf

289
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:51,299
is really humid and there isn't much

290
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:53,759
pressure being placed on the leaf to

291
00:10:51,299 --> 00:10:56,278
transpire so the transpiration rate and

292
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:58,259
water demand decreases

293
00:10:56,278 --> 00:11:01,139
research shows that the tighter you can

294
00:10:58,259 --> 00:11:02,759
control VPD and reduce fluctuations

295
00:11:01,139 --> 00:11:05,039
during a plant's life the more

296
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:07,679
productive it will be and significant

297
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:11,039
yield increases can be achieved with the

298
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:13,379
appropriate mechanical systems 24 7 VPD

299
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:16,319
controls possible and can lead to these

300
00:11:13,379 --> 00:11:19,200
significant yield increases

301
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:21,000
lastly there seems to be a lot of

302
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,680
confusion around dpd amongst Growers

303
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,620
that I'd like to try and address

304
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:27,899
and it surrounds Leaf temperature VPD

305
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:29,159
charts and getting an accurate BPD

306
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:32,159
measurement

307
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:34,199
so when touring facilities I often see a

308
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:36,480
VPD chart printed off the internet and

309
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:38,040
taped up to the wall the grower then

310
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,320
checks the temp and relative humidity

311
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:42,480
from the sensors in their room and uses

312
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,459
the chart to figure out their BPD

313
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,560
the problem with the static chart like

314
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:48,838
that is they almost always assume that

315
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:50,879
the leaf temperature equals the air

316
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:52,560
temperature which we know is not always

317
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:54,059
true given the evaporative cooling

318
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:57,000
effect of transpiration

319
00:11:54,059 --> 00:11:59,099
so they get an approximate VPD but this

320
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,778
can be pretty misleading essentially

321
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:02,399
most Growers are not measuring their

322
00:12:00,778 --> 00:12:03,240
Leaf temps and factoring it into the

323
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,458
equation

324
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:07,259
and that's fine if you are in a

325
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:09,539
greenhouse for example where the

326
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:12,179
environment fluctuates so much more on a

327
00:12:09,539 --> 00:12:14,759
daily basis than a modern day indoor

328
00:12:12,179 --> 00:12:15,599
grow that an approximate VPD is good

329
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:17,578
enough

330
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,399
but with the highly optimized indoor

331
00:12:17,578 --> 00:12:22,139
grows with good environmental control we

332
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:24,600
are pushing these plants transpiration

333
00:12:22,139 --> 00:12:25,799
rates to the limit which increases that

334
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:28,139
evaporative cooling effective

335
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:30,179
transpiration and drops the leaf temp to

336
00:12:28,139 --> 00:12:31,919
a greater degree

337
00:12:30,179 --> 00:12:33,659
so look at these two example

338
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:36,379
calculations

339
00:12:33,659 --> 00:12:39,299
on the bottom the one on the left

340
00:12:36,379 --> 00:12:43,200
assumes the air temp equals the leaf

341
00:12:39,299 --> 00:12:45,899
temperature and you get a 1.2 VPD

342
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:48,120
and on the right the leaf temperature is

343
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:50,578
factored in at five degrees lower than

344
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,839
the air temp and now you get a VPD of

345
00:12:50,578 --> 00:12:54,179
0.7

346
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,500
so without factoring in leaf temp you

347
00:12:54,179 --> 00:12:57,479
might think you are providing your

348
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:59,759
plants a good condition for Mid flower

349
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:02,100
when in reality your plants are feeling

350
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:04,740
a VPD more conducive to vegetative

351
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:07,259
growth a difference of 0.5 is

352
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:09,899
significant in VPD terms

353
00:13:07,259 --> 00:13:12,659
and so somehow this kind of confusion

354
00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:15,240
around using Leaf temp or not resulted

355
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:18,059
in the terms air VPD and leaf VPD being

356
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:21,360
coined where avpd does not factor in

357
00:13:18,059 --> 00:13:24,719
leaf Temp and the lvpd does but in

358
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,220
reality lvpd is the true VPD and the

359
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,300
true pressure that the plant feels to

360
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:29,700
transpire

361
00:13:27,299 --> 00:13:32,479
and I highly suggest all indoor Growers

362
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,480
measure Leaf temperature

363
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:39,719
so really quickly same type of example

364
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:42,720
but on a VPD chart

365
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:45,180
this VPD values on this chart assume

366
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:48,000
Leaf temperature equals air temp and the

367
00:13:45,179 --> 00:13:51,359
blue region is a target range of 1.0 to

368
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:54,120
1.5 and our example room is sitting at

369
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:57,959
80 degrees 60 relative humidity in that

370
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:59,339
red box with a VPD of 1.4

371
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:03,179
okay

372
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:05,160
now look room is still at 80 60 but the

373
00:14:03,179 --> 00:14:08,039
values on the VPD chart have been

374
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:09,539
recalculated taking a negative five leaf

375
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:12,360
temp offset into account

376
00:14:09,539 --> 00:14:15,000
look how the blue region has shifted and

377
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,959
instead of a 1.4 VPD we are actually at

378
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,639
0.9

379
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:19,859
again just highlighting the importance

380
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:22,019
for indoor cultivators that leaf temp

381
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:25,200
should be measured and tracked

382
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:26,459
and help dictate your set points in your

383
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:29,278
room

384
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:31,919
okay moving on

385
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:34,078
with indoor growing we have all these

386
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:36,240
growth parameters and plant processes

387
00:14:34,078 --> 00:14:38,939
going on within a very tightly sealed

388
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:41,519
box and this creates a highly Dynamic

389
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:42,480
space with a lot of rapid changes to the

390
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:45,120
environment

391
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:47,820
particularly

392
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:51,240
flower rooms generate substantial and

393
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:52,879
dynamic loads both on a daily basis and

394
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:55,500
over the course of a harvest cycle

395
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:57,360
compare that to an office space or your

396
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,980
home where the conditions are fairly

397
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,079
static they don't they don't change that

398
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:03,778
frequently or dramatically

399
00:15:01,078 --> 00:15:06,000
and to design and operate efficient HVAC

400
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:07,919
systems we must understand the Dynamics

401
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,198
that are happening in these spaces

402
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:12,179
throughout a harvest cycle are left

403
00:15:10,198 --> 00:15:13,919
uncontrolled these drastic changes in

404
00:15:12,179 --> 00:15:16,138
the environment lead to poor Plant

405
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:17,939
Health Quality and yield

406
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:19,500
growing at the end of the day is all

407
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:20,459
about maintaining balance within the

408
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,259
system

409
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:24,679
within the room and within the plant

410
00:15:22,259 --> 00:15:24,679
itself

411
00:15:25,019 --> 00:15:30,060
so from a mechanical System point of

412
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:31,860
view the water balance in these rooms is

413
00:15:30,059 --> 00:15:34,159
particularly challenging to manage

414
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:37,079
compared to other HVAC applications

415
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:39,480
there are not many other indoor spaces

416
00:15:37,078 --> 00:15:41,399
that require as much dehumidification as

417
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:43,680
indoor plant environments

418
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:45,360
and this graphic highlights just some of

419
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:47,879
the moisture dynamics that must be

420
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:50,220
considered when designing and sizing a

421
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:52,860
mechanical system there's a lot going on

422
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:56,660
but all of this can be Quantified to

423
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:56,659
size the dehumidification requirements

424
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:03,720
by understanding the plant processes and

425
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:05,578
the variables that affect these Dynamics

426
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:08,579
we can engineer a solution to balance

427
00:16:05,578 --> 00:16:10,679
them so for example growth phase and

428
00:16:08,578 --> 00:16:13,078
plant age on the upper left

429
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:14,939
as plants grow and get bigger their

430
00:16:13,078 --> 00:16:17,338
water demand increases and they

431
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:18,600
transpire greater volumes of water into

432
00:16:17,339 --> 00:16:20,880
the space

433
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:23,820
transpiration rates can increase almost

434
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:25,860
40 to 50 percent over the course of a

435
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:28,800
flowering cycle so this is where

436
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:31,079
variable capacity HVAC systems with

437
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:32,698
modulating components and the right

438
00:16:31,078 --> 00:16:35,099
control sequences become really

439
00:16:32,698 --> 00:16:37,740
important so you don't over cool or over

440
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:39,959
dry the space during partial load

441
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:42,539
scenarios

442
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:45,059
in the middle the photo period also

443
00:16:42,539 --> 00:16:46,860
affects the moisture Dynamics plants

444
00:16:45,059 --> 00:16:48,659
transpire a majority of the water into

445
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:50,399
the air when the lights are on and they

446
00:16:48,659 --> 00:16:53,879
are photosynthesizing

447
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:55,679
in a flower room about 75 percent of the

448
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:58,439
moisture needs to be removed during the

449
00:16:55,679 --> 00:17:00,719
lights on period and about 25 percent

450
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:01,920
during the lights off period in a given

451
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,578
day

452
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:08,399
the lights on to off and off to on

453
00:17:05,578 --> 00:17:11,279
transition periods are by far the most

454
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:13,919
challenging Dynamic shift that a

455
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:16,798
mechanical system must control as the

456
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:19,740
lights turn off the temperature drops

457
00:17:16,798 --> 00:17:22,379
and the relative humidity spikes which

458
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:25,679
requires an immediate and significant

459
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:28,679
dehumidification requirement

460
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:30,860
this Spike can be overcome again with

461
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:33,600
things like variable capacity systems

462
00:17:30,859 --> 00:17:35,579
appropriately sized reheat and

463
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:38,759
purpose-built controls which are things

464
00:17:35,579 --> 00:17:41,460
that come standard it inspires units

465
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:43,679
ppfd or light intensity on the upper

466
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:45,480
right also greatly affects the moisture

467
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:48,419
Dynamics in the space

468
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:51,480
as the ppfd increases the water demand

469
00:17:48,419 --> 00:17:53,580
and transpiration rates increase as well

470
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:56,099
with the newer high-intensity LED

471
00:17:53,579 --> 00:17:58,619
fixtures today Growers are pushing their

472
00:17:56,099 --> 00:18:00,959
ppfd higher and higher to increase

473
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:04,259
yields and shorten cycle times

474
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:07,500
so for many years a thousand to 1200

475
00:18:04,259 --> 00:18:09,119
ppfd in flower was the standard but now

476
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:13,440
many Growers are designing and building

477
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:17,399
rooms at 1500 plus ppfd all the way up

478
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:19,860
to 2000 and push neglect limits so if

479
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:22,740
you are planning on a high ppfd strategy

480
00:18:19,859 --> 00:18:24,479
your mechanical systems must be upsized

481
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:26,640
accordingly to handle the higher

482
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:30,200
transpiration rates where you will not

483
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,200
be able to maintain humidity control

484
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:36,839
so sensible and latent loads are how we

485
00:18:35,038 --> 00:18:39,240
are going to quantify these Dynamic

486
00:18:36,839 --> 00:18:41,699
needs of an indoor plant environment and

487
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:42,720
appropriately size an HVAC system for a

488
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:45,480
given room

489
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:48,179
inaccurate load calculations lead to

490
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:50,279
undersized or oversized equipment which

491
00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:53,220
both present challenges

492
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:56,220
for most HVAC applications like offices

493
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:58,798
residential homes or even gymnasiums

494
00:18:56,220 --> 00:19:01,200
there are published standards for

495
00:18:58,798 --> 00:19:03,179
Ministry organizations that Engineers

496
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,860
can refer to for guidance when

497
00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:07,440
calculating loads

498
00:19:04,859 --> 00:19:09,000
however with the the nasancy of the

499
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,759
Cannabis industry

500
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,619
no good standards currently exist for

501
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:15,179
indoor plant environments for engineers

502
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:16,678
to refer to

503
00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:18,059
luckily that is going to change

504
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:20,038
ourselves and a number of other

505
00:19:18,058 --> 00:19:22,558
colleagues in this working on this

506
00:19:20,038 --> 00:19:24,900
application with industry organizations

507
00:19:22,558 --> 00:19:26,819
are looking to publish those in the

508
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:28,500
coming years

509
00:19:26,819 --> 00:19:30,839
for now I'd like to go through an

510
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:33,660
example load calculation and the system

511
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:36,418
selection process to better prepare you

512
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:38,340
for your next facility build out

513
00:19:36,419 --> 00:19:41,220
there are two types of loads we must

514
00:19:38,339 --> 00:19:43,678
calculate to size a system the sensible

515
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:45,720
heat load which dictates our cooling and

516
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:47,700
heating requirements and the latent heat

517
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:50,640
load which gives us the dehumidification

518
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:52,440
or humidification requirements and as we

519
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,179
go through this example keep in mind

520
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:56,038
that I have simplified some of these

521
00:19:54,179 --> 00:19:58,559
calculations for the purpose of this

522
00:19:56,038 --> 00:20:00,660
webinar and other variables not shown

523
00:19:58,558 --> 00:20:02,940
here are considered when doing this in

524
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:04,558
practice I didn't want to put you all to

525
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:05,880
sleep or scare you away with too much

526
00:20:04,558 --> 00:20:08,639
math

527
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:11,820
so for this example we're going to use a

528
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:14,460
relatively small flower room

529
00:20:11,819 --> 00:20:16,259
extensible loads include anything that

530
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:18,840
generates heat we can feel within a grow

531
00:20:16,259 --> 00:20:21,779
room Horticultural lighting fixtures

532
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:23,939
account for 95 or more of a sensible

533
00:20:21,779 --> 00:20:26,399
load in indoor plant environments

534
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:29,340
any other Appliance within the space

535
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:31,740
that uses electricity will also add to

536
00:20:29,339 --> 00:20:33,720
the sensible load such as fans or

537
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:36,000
irrigation pumps

538
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:37,679
many rooms also have Standalone

539
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,980
dehumidifiers hung within the space

540
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:44,220
which generate a lot of waste heat while

541
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:46,079
dehumidifying the air at Inspire we

542
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:49,079
design and sell what we call Integrated

543
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:52,079
hvacd Systems that incorporate that

544
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:54,599
dehumidification capacity into the HVAC

545
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:57,599
system removing the need for Standalone

546
00:20:54,599 --> 00:21:00,240
dehus in the room hence the D and hvacd

547
00:20:57,599 --> 00:21:02,038
to emphasize dehumidification

548
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,900
and Adrian will discuss this in Greater

549
00:21:02,038 --> 00:21:05,640
detail in part two of the webinar in a

550
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:08,759
few weeks

551
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:11,640
okay for this example we have 32 000

552
00:21:08,759 --> 00:21:13,679
Watt HPS fixtures in our flower room

553
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:16,020
we calculate the total wattage of all

554
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:18,120
the fixtures and then convert watts to

555
00:21:16,019 --> 00:21:20,099
BTU per hour which is a measure of

556
00:21:18,119 --> 00:21:22,558
energy in the form of heat

557
00:21:20,099 --> 00:21:24,659
and we get a large number

558
00:21:22,558 --> 00:21:27,240
so we divide by a thousand to make it

559
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:28,919
more manageable to work with and the

560
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:32,940
result is

561
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:34,799
of our sensible load is 109.2 MBH or

562
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:37,080
what's called Mega British thermal units

563
00:21:34,798 --> 00:21:39,000
per hour MBH is really the most common

564
00:21:37,079 --> 00:21:41,220
use

565
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,099
but if we went with the same number of

566
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:47,038
more efficient LED fixtures at 700 watts

567
00:21:44,099 --> 00:21:49,980
and do the same math we now get a sense

568
00:21:47,038 --> 00:21:52,859
below it of 76.4 mph

569
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:55,759
it's a 30 reduction in the sensible load

570
00:21:52,859 --> 00:21:55,759
compared to HPS

571
00:21:56,339 --> 00:22:00,240
so I want to use those in my flower room

572
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:04,159
they're more efficient I'm going to have

573
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,159
a lower operating expense because of it

574
00:22:05,339 --> 00:22:09,139
so the latent loads are where an

575
00:22:07,619 --> 00:22:11,759
understanding of plant science

576
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:14,100
cultivation and room Dynamics become

577
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:15,240
necessary with with no published

578
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:17,639
standards

579
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:19,919
we came up with this formula inspired to

580
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:23,340
calculate the latent load the math

581
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:25,799
itself is simple but inputting the right

582
00:22:23,339 --> 00:22:27,658
values for each of these variables and

583
00:22:25,798 --> 00:22:30,119
understanding how they affect the system

584
00:22:27,659 --> 00:22:32,520
sizing is why we built a

585
00:22:30,119 --> 00:22:35,639
multi-disciplinary team of plant

586
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:37,200
scientists cultivators and engineers and

587
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,460
take a collaborative approach with our

588
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,100
customers to understand their

589
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:42,600
cultivation strategies establishing an

590
00:22:41,099 --> 00:22:45,199
open line of communication with the

591
00:22:42,599 --> 00:22:47,819
cultivators early in the design phase

592
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:50,279
goes a long way in right sizing these

593
00:22:47,819 --> 00:22:53,399
loads and systems

594
00:22:50,279 --> 00:22:56,519
the result of this calculation gives us

595
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:59,220
the pounds of water per hour

596
00:22:56,519 --> 00:23:01,918
moisture removal requirement for a given

597
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:03,839
room it's important that we target the

598
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:05,759
maximum latent load that room will

599
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:08,038
generate over its operational lifespan

600
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:10,798
to Future proof the design and provide

601
00:23:08,038 --> 00:23:13,440
the right capacity

602
00:23:10,798 --> 00:23:15,480
the most crucial step in this process is

603
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:18,240
getting an accurate total daily watering

604
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:21,179
rate in gallons per day there at the top

605
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:23,099
while it's labeled watering rate it's

606
00:23:21,179 --> 00:23:26,340
better to think of this as the maximum

607
00:23:23,099 --> 00:23:29,339
volume of water transpired by the plants

608
00:23:26,339 --> 00:23:30,899
into the air in a day you know for a

609
00:23:29,339 --> 00:23:33,240
given room

610
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:35,940
seemingly what you would think as small

611
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:37,859
changes to this value can result in

612
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:40,080
drastically different unit sizes and

613
00:23:37,859 --> 00:23:41,399
costs that these rooms get bigger and

614
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:43,798
bigger

615
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:47,100
the total daily watering rate can be

616
00:23:43,798 --> 00:23:50,519
calculated on either a gallons per plant

617
00:23:47,099 --> 00:23:53,339
basis or on a gallons per canopy square

618
00:23:50,519 --> 00:23:55,079
foot basis the total surface area of all

619
00:23:53,339 --> 00:23:57,178
the trays in the room

620
00:23:55,079 --> 00:23:59,519
the canopy square foot route is

621
00:23:57,179 --> 00:24:01,080
preferred because once these rolling

622
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:03,058
benches or multi-tiered racks are

623
00:24:01,079 --> 00:24:04,199
installed it is a fixed variable and

624
00:24:03,058 --> 00:24:06,960
doesn't change

625
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:08,819
while the plant count often changes once

626
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,620
the facility is up and running and

627
00:24:08,819 --> 00:24:13,558
sometimes I've seen it fluctuate by as

628
00:24:10,619 --> 00:24:16,079
much as 15 to 20 percent from the design

629
00:24:13,558 --> 00:24:18,058
phase to what's actually being done in

630
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:21,658
the field

631
00:24:18,058 --> 00:24:24,480
so why I like the canopy route

632
00:24:21,659 --> 00:24:27,480
so for this example we have our same

633
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:30,839
relatively small flower room with 512

634
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:33,599
feet uh square feet of canopy

635
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:37,918
we have a 0.26 gallons per square foot

636
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:40,038
watering rate giving us 133 gallons per

637
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:40,038
day

638
00:24:40,558 --> 00:24:46,319
next we plug that into the equation from

639
00:24:42,839 --> 00:24:47,939
before and we get a latent load of 69.3

640
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:50,519
pounds per hour moisture removal

641
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:51,960
requirement so we have that 75 percent

642
00:24:50,519 --> 00:24:54,480
moist removal during the day we talked

643
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:57,538
about the 12 hour photo period and then

644
00:24:54,480 --> 00:25:00,839
we use the 8.33 to convert pounds uh

645
00:24:57,538 --> 00:25:03,900
from gallon to pounds

646
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:06,500
so we can also convert pounds per hour

647
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:09,780
to MBH like in our sensible load to get

648
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:11,759
74.8 MBH as well and that is the latent

649
00:25:09,779 --> 00:25:14,879
load of our room in two different units

650
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:17,700
pounds per hour and MBH

651
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:21,299
and in summary this example flower room

652
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:24,960
has a sensible or cooling load of 76.4

653
00:25:21,298 --> 00:25:28,918
mph with those LEDs and a latent or

654
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:30,900
dehumidification load of 74.8 mph

655
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:33,240
Engineers would describe this room as

656
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:36,419
having a sensible heat ratio of 0.51

657
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:40,140
meaning 51 percent of the room load

658
00:25:36,419 --> 00:25:41,759
requires Cooling and 49 requires

659
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:44,460
dehumidification

660
00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:47,879
most Comfort cooling or human-centric

661
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:51,000
HVAC applications have an shr closer to

662
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:53,220
0.85 they they require almost all

663
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:56,460
cooling capacity out of the equipment

664
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:59,640
and as a result almost all HVAC units

665
00:25:56,460 --> 00:26:02,880
today on the market have an shr of about

666
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:06,000
0.85 with 85 percent of their total

667
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:08,760
capacity going to Cooling and only some

668
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,500
going to demidification as a byproduct

669
00:26:08,759 --> 00:26:14,179
of the cooling process

670
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:17,519
so this shr here is why we had to design

671
00:26:14,179 --> 00:26:19,440
purpose-built integrated units to serve

672
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:21,240
indoor plant environments because they

673
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:24,019
really have a different need than most

674
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:24,019
other spaces

675
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:28,798
the final step in the system selection

676
00:26:27,058 --> 00:26:30,839
process now that we have the loads

677
00:26:28,798 --> 00:26:32,700
calculated is to find a unit that can

678
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:35,519
meet the required capacities that we've

679
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:38,278
run in our load calcs at the temperature

680
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:40,259
and relative humidity conditions that

681
00:26:38,278 --> 00:26:41,640
the cultivator is realistically going to

682
00:26:40,259 --> 00:26:43,740
run the room at

683
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:46,140
these are called the design conditions

684
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:48,240
during the system selection process

685
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:49,559
and can lead to over undersizing a

686
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:52,980
system as well

687
00:26:49,558 --> 00:26:54,658
for all HVAC or mechanical systems it is

688
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:56,700
easier for them to remove moisture from

689
00:26:54,659 --> 00:26:58,860
the air at warmer temperatures

690
00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:01,080
so as selection temperature and Rh

691
00:26:58,859 --> 00:27:03,599
decrease and room conditions decrease

692
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:05,699
you need a bigger and larger capacity

693
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:08,339
unit to meet that load

694
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:11,759
this table shows an example unit's moist

695
00:27:08,339 --> 00:27:13,918
removal capacities in pounds per hour at

696
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:16,200
various conditions this is the

697
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:20,159
performance data for this unit

698
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:22,860
and from 8270 on the upper left down to

699
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:25,559
the bottom right to 65.50 following that

700
00:27:22,859 --> 00:27:28,439
green line This unit's moisture removal

701
00:27:25,558 --> 00:27:31,139
capacity decreases by 80 percent

702
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:32,940
there are significant D rates depending

703
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:36,600
on the design conditions and the room

704
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:40,558
conditions this equipment's operating in

705
00:27:36,599 --> 00:27:43,798
but at 75.55 a reasonable condition to

706
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:46,740
run a room at this unit can do 77.4

707
00:27:43,798 --> 00:27:48,240
pounds per hour which meets our 69.3

708
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:49,980
pounds per hour requirement from our

709
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:52,500
example

710
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:54,360
so this unit would probably be a pretty

711
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:56,339
good fit at the right design conditions

712
00:27:54,359 --> 00:27:59,399
and has the capacity to meet that late

713
00:27:56,339 --> 00:28:01,678
load now in practice this is done by

714
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:05,100
software that has the performance data

715
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:09,500
for every unit at various conditions to

716
00:28:05,099 --> 00:28:09,500
find the best fit for a given load

717
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:15,178
the design conditions present a delicate

718
00:28:13,019 --> 00:28:17,099
balance between the range of set points

719
00:28:15,179 --> 00:28:19,620
or VPD targets

720
00:28:17,099 --> 00:28:21,538
A system can achieve and the overall

721
00:28:19,619 --> 00:28:24,418
cost of the system

722
00:28:21,538 --> 00:28:26,579
as the design conditions go up the

723
00:28:24,419 --> 00:28:28,740
temperature and relativity go up

724
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:31,558
the ability for a system to remove

725
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:35,220
moisture goes up and so the required

726
00:28:31,558 --> 00:28:37,918
unit size goes down along with the cost

727
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:41,278
but the Grower's ability now to hit all

728
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:43,500
those VPD targets also goes down and you

729
00:28:41,278 --> 00:28:45,599
lose some set point flexibility and you

730
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:47,278
run the risk of undersizing the system

731
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:49,980
and vice versa when it comes to

732
00:28:47,278 --> 00:28:51,900
oversizing lower those design conditions

733
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:55,079
lower the moisture removal capacity of

734
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:57,480
equipment gets bigger the unit and the

735
00:28:55,079 --> 00:29:01,139
connected electrical structural support

736
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:03,778
required the costs but you get some

737
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:05,759
greater set point flexibility

738
00:29:03,778 --> 00:29:08,099
so you have to find a very good middle

739
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:10,140
ground to balance these things

740
00:29:08,099 --> 00:29:12,178
you can have the most accurate load

741
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:13,740
calcs in the world but with the wrong

742
00:29:12,179 --> 00:29:16,080
design conditions you really run the

743
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:18,538
risk of increasing the capex and Opex

744
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:20,519
for your project or undersizing the

745
00:29:18,538 --> 00:29:22,500
system resulting in poor Plant health

746
00:29:20,519 --> 00:29:25,019
and yields that are really hard to

747
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:27,720
overcome uh once the systems are

748
00:29:25,019 --> 00:29:29,879
installed and require a much higher

749
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:32,278
labor cost to manage

750
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:34,919
the table on the bottom here are design

751
00:29:32,278 --> 00:29:37,558
conditions I recently got from a

752
00:29:34,919 --> 00:29:39,659
customer for an LED flower room and so

753
00:29:37,558 --> 00:29:44,220
for the lights on period they wanted to

754
00:29:39,659 --> 00:29:46,980
be able to hit 75 50 minimum and 85.65

755
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:48,538
maximum so as an exercise I calculated

756
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:51,240
the sensible latent loads for these

757
00:29:48,538 --> 00:29:53,278
rooms and I ran the selection through

758
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:58,980
that software we talked about at both

759
00:29:53,278 --> 00:30:03,298
conditions both 85 65 and 75.50

760
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:05,399
and going from 85 65 to 75.50 doubled

761
00:30:03,298 --> 00:30:06,839
the size of the system and doubled the

762
00:30:05,398 --> 00:30:09,298
cost

763
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:11,000
so at the end of the day we settle on a

764
00:30:09,298 --> 00:30:13,740
middle ground of actually

765
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:17,159
78.55 for the design conditions for this

766
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:19,200
room which will allow them to hit 75.50

767
00:30:17,159 --> 00:30:21,480
at the end of the flowering cycle when

768
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,278
they want to when transpiration rates

769
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:25,740
have started to subside

770
00:30:23,278 --> 00:30:27,720
without blowing up their budget and

771
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:29,819
getting them too big or too small of a

772
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:32,159
system

773
00:30:29,819 --> 00:30:34,319
and that folks is an overview of how

774
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:36,778
mechanical systems are sized and

775
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:38,460
selected for indoor plant environments

776
00:30:36,778 --> 00:30:41,220
and some of the core plant science

777
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:43,440
Concepts to understand

778
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:44,759
I wanted to just introduce to you some

779
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,960
resources if you're interested in

780
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:47,398
learning more

781
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:49,860
um on the top there are some of my

782
00:30:47,398 --> 00:30:51,359
favorite books and in the middle there

783
00:30:49,859 --> 00:30:54,658
are some great industry organizations

784
00:30:51,359 --> 00:30:56,819
that are doing valuable work we work

785
00:30:54,659 --> 00:30:59,039
some at least one person in our company

786
00:30:56,819 --> 00:31:01,798
is involved in one of each of these uh

787
00:30:59,038 --> 00:31:03,778
organizations I highly recommend

788
00:31:01,798 --> 00:31:06,480
checking them out and coming involved to

789
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:08,278
help push this application forward and

790
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:10,500
as well you can check out the resources

791
00:31:08,278 --> 00:31:12,500
page on our website where there's a

792
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:16,440
number of other webinars and articles

793
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:19,140
along with some calculators with these

794
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:22,019
these formulas plugged into so that you

795
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:24,000
can you know play with them

796
00:31:22,019 --> 00:31:26,278
and that really concludes today's

797
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,659
presentation thank you for listening I

798
00:31:26,278 --> 00:31:29,460
hope you learned something today and

799
00:31:27,659 --> 00:31:31,620
found this useful we're going to move

800
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:33,778
into some q a and answer some questions

801
00:31:31,619 --> 00:31:35,819
before we wrap this up and I think

802
00:31:33,778 --> 00:31:39,919
Adrian's going to join me during this

803
00:31:35,819 --> 00:31:43,980
this q a session as well thank you

804
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:46,799
so let's see here I've got a couple of

805
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:48,240
questions sitting here in Q a that I

806
00:31:46,798 --> 00:31:51,298
think we can start with that are really

807
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:52,980
good the first one is uh

808
00:31:51,298 --> 00:31:54,538
do you have recommendations best

809
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:56,940
practices for measuring Leaf temperature

810
00:31:54,538 --> 00:32:00,140
and particularly how to do it in a way

811
00:31:56,940 --> 00:32:00,140
that feeds into a control system

812
00:32:00,298 --> 00:32:05,099
yeah that's a good question

813
00:32:02,339 --> 00:32:07,199
um you know funny enough I actually have

814
00:32:05,099 --> 00:32:09,658
my high arc on here which is the manual

815
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:11,399
method of measuring Leaf temperature so

816
00:32:09,659 --> 00:32:13,799
this is an infrared thermometer for

817
00:32:11,398 --> 00:32:16,139
manual measurements of leaf surface

818
00:32:13,798 --> 00:32:18,960
temperature

819
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:20,580
um a thing to note about measuring Leaf

820
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,419
temperature with some a tool like this

821
00:32:20,579 --> 00:32:24,859
is

822
00:32:21,419 --> 00:32:28,080
every service every surface out there

823
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:29,398
absorbs radiation at different rates and

824
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:31,019
reflects it at different rates and

825
00:32:29,398 --> 00:32:33,298
that's called emissivity

826
00:32:31,019 --> 00:32:34,798
and so uh when you get one of these guns

827
00:32:33,298 --> 00:32:37,079
you want to make sure you get one with

828
00:32:34,798 --> 00:32:41,639
adjustable emissivity setting

829
00:32:37,079 --> 00:32:43,740
and an emissivity of 0.97 is conducive

830
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:47,360
to getting an accurate Leaf temperature

831
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:51,720
measurement most plants are between

832
00:32:47,359 --> 00:32:53,819
0.95 and 0.98 and all the research I can

833
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:55,140
found suggests that a 0.97 emissivity

834
00:32:53,819 --> 00:32:57,298
gets you the most accurate measurement

835
00:32:55,140 --> 00:33:00,120
so what I do is you go through a room

836
00:32:57,298 --> 00:33:01,139
and you stand with a gun about 12 inches

837
00:33:00,119 --> 00:33:03,599
away from the leaf surface

838
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:05,640
perpendicularly that gives you about a

839
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:08,219
one and a half inch measurement diameter

840
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:10,799
on the leaf surface and you want to take

841
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:12,419
these measurements at multiple areas

842
00:33:10,798 --> 00:33:15,298
throughout a room to get a statistical

843
00:33:12,419 --> 00:33:17,820
average of the space I like to do that

844
00:33:15,298 --> 00:33:19,740
in the middle of the photo period like

845
00:33:17,819 --> 00:33:21,298
say six hours into a 12 hour photo

846
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:22,679
period to get the most consistent

847
00:33:21,298 --> 00:33:24,720
results every day

848
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:26,940
and then I average all those

849
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:29,339
measurements and use it to dictate my

850
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:31,320
set points and how I run my system and

851
00:33:29,339 --> 00:33:33,778
what VPD on that

852
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:35,398
now about integrating the control system

853
00:33:33,778 --> 00:33:37,259
there are a lot of ways to do this

854
00:33:35,398 --> 00:33:39,298
automatically without a manual

855
00:33:37,259 --> 00:33:39,898
measurement

856
00:33:39,298 --> 00:33:42,418
um

857
00:33:39,898 --> 00:33:45,000
it's especially today as these sensors

858
00:33:42,419 --> 00:33:47,340
in the iot is it you know things has

859
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,898
gotten so much cheaper and so there are

860
00:33:47,339 --> 00:33:51,298
a couple different approaches there are

861
00:33:48,898 --> 00:33:54,000
cameras that try and ignore the ground

862
00:33:51,298 --> 00:33:56,220
and the benches and hit only the canopy

863
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,980
to get a good measurement at the right

864
00:33:56,220 --> 00:34:00,480
angle and then there are also like Leaf

865
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:02,640
calipers that almost have a little

866
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:04,620
thermistor underneath the leaf to

867
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:06,600
measure the temperature you can plug a

868
00:34:04,619 --> 00:34:07,918
bunch of them in around the room those

869
00:34:06,599 --> 00:34:11,338
are both ways in which you can

870
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:13,378
automatically Monitor and data log it in

871
00:34:11,338 --> 00:34:15,059
a space

872
00:34:13,378 --> 00:34:16,679
yeah Leaf temperature I love it it's one

873
00:34:15,059 --> 00:34:17,759
of my favorite topics so many cool

874
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:19,740
things you can do with Leaf temperature

875
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:22,080
in fact I even use it to time my

876
00:34:19,739 --> 00:34:23,699
irrigation events like in the P1 events

877
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:25,799
of crop steering you can sit there and

878
00:34:23,699 --> 00:34:28,199
measure Leaf temp or look at your water

879
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:30,179
content in your substrate but as lights

880
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:32,358
turn on and that starts to drop leaf

881
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:34,858
temp drops water content drops

882
00:34:32,358 --> 00:34:38,480
transpiration has begun and you can

883
00:34:34,858 --> 00:34:38,480
start irrigating your plants

884
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:45,299
very cool so and I think related to that

885
00:34:42,898 --> 00:34:47,398
question is can your Leaf VPD change

886
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:50,659
every couple minutes within a room

887
00:34:47,398 --> 00:34:50,659
with the stable environment

888
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:54,720
with a stable environment that's an

889
00:34:52,739 --> 00:34:57,000
important distinction if the room

890
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:59,519
doesn't have homogeneous airflow

891
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,519
then delete the leaf temperature will

892
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:03,900
vary throughout a space

893
00:35:01,519 --> 00:35:06,000
essentially that the faster the airflow

894
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:08,820
a plant is getting uh the more

895
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,440
convective uh buoyancy flux essentially

896
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:12,480
and the

897
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:15,420
transpiration rates will increase so in

898
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:17,159
areas of stagnant airflow you'll

899
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:18,200
typically see higher Leaf surface

900
00:35:17,159 --> 00:35:20,819
temperatures

901
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:23,219
they can change

902
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:24,960
but not that rapidly actually so the

903
00:35:23,219 --> 00:35:26,939
reason being is the plants have

904
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:28,980
developed these processes to balance

905
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:31,260
themselves and so the leaf temperature

906
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:34,139
is actually much more stable in a space

907
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:36,240
than the air temperature is because the

908
00:35:34,139 --> 00:35:38,578
plants are using that stomata and

909
00:35:36,239 --> 00:35:40,679
transpiration that cooling effect to to

910
00:35:38,579 --> 00:35:43,500
bounce it

911
00:35:40,679 --> 00:35:46,980
it's it's that uh concept that plants

912
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:49,739
are are immobile organisms right we

913
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:52,858
humans can get up and run if it's hot or

914
00:35:49,739 --> 00:35:57,899
dry or too cold but plants have adapted

915
00:35:52,858 --> 00:35:59,460
processes that allow them to to adapt to

916
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:00,900
the environment where they are because

917
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:02,460
they can't move

918
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:04,260
that's right yeah they've had to develop

919
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:05,579
these things like stomat opening and

920
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:07,200
closing to

921
00:36:05,579 --> 00:36:09,660
protect themselves in unfavorable

922
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:11,460
environments where we can just run away

923
00:36:09,659 --> 00:36:13,199
you know

924
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:15,420
very cool

925
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:17,939
my sweater let's see

926
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:19,619
do you want to uh there's one last one

927
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:22,139
on Leaf temperature and just differences

928
00:36:19,619 --> 00:36:25,440
between very does it does it vary

929
00:36:22,139 --> 00:36:27,960
between HPS and led Maybe

930
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:30,179
is a good finisher for that

931
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:31,740
topic

932
00:36:30,179 --> 00:36:35,519
yeah sure

933
00:36:31,739 --> 00:36:37,679
um so typically because of the

934
00:36:35,519 --> 00:36:40,940
the infrared radiation or the radiant

935
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:43,259
heat that these HPS fixtures give off

936
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:45,599
oftentimes the leaf temperature can be

937
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:49,619
higher in HPS rooms or the offset be

938
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:51,780
less than in LED spaces but that is not

939
00:36:49,619 --> 00:36:53,760
always consistent depending on the

940
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:55,440
lighting design and room design so

941
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:57,300
depending on the mounting height of

942
00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:00,240
those lights

943
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:01,380
um how big the space is because uh for

944
00:37:00,239 --> 00:37:04,618
example a

945
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:07,019
colleague of mine an engineer Chris Webb

946
00:37:04,619 --> 00:37:10,320
he he has a great saying that the larger

947
00:37:07,019 --> 00:37:12,719
the biosphere the slower the changes and

948
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:15,180
the smaller the biosphere the more rapid

949
00:37:12,719 --> 00:37:18,059
the changes and so same thing with these

950
00:37:15,179 --> 00:37:20,639
Leaf temperature and HPS first led with

951
00:37:18,059 --> 00:37:22,320
a bigger space lights further away the

952
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:23,578
environment can kind of balance itself

953
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:25,680
and

954
00:37:23,579 --> 00:37:27,539
respond a little bit slower to

955
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:30,838
environmental changes than in a smaller

956
00:37:27,539 --> 00:37:32,880
space but I've seen in rooms with HPS

957
00:37:30,838 --> 00:37:34,679
lights the leaf temperature be higher

958
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,820
than the

959
00:37:34,679 --> 00:37:38,940
um

960
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:41,039
you know the room conditions and

961
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:42,960
therefore that's why a lot of HPS rooms

962
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:45,539
have to run their their set points a lot

963
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:48,179
lower to offset that and so one of the

964
00:37:45,539 --> 00:37:50,279
big benefits of LEDs is you can run your

965
00:37:48,179 --> 00:37:52,618
rooms a lot warmer and maintain the same

966
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:55,079
Leaf temperature and it just saves you

967
00:37:52,619 --> 00:37:56,880
money on your you know utility bills

968
00:37:55,079 --> 00:37:59,240
every month as well from your HVAC

969
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,240
system

970
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:05,460
and potentially the uh the the capex

971
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:07,260
spend up front if you don't have to size

972
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:09,539
your systems as aggressively

973
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:11,520
that's right yeah you don't have to the

974
00:38:09,539 --> 00:38:13,800
design conditions are more amenable with

975
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:15,960
LED rooms than HPS to give you that

976
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:19,320
control

977
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:20,699
awesome thank you uh here's another good

978
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:22,260
question what are the advantages

979
00:38:20,699 --> 00:38:24,899
disadvantages of having single or

980
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:27,839
multiple hvacd units servicing the same

981
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:29,820
cultivation environment you prefer one

982
00:38:27,838 --> 00:38:31,619
large unit or multiple small units and

983
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:34,800
why I understand this may be dependent

984
00:38:31,619 --> 00:38:37,200
on particular conditions for that space

985
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:39,000
yeah that's a really good question I'm

986
00:38:37,199 --> 00:38:40,799
happy to touch on that a bit and I think

987
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,358
Adrian actually in part two in a few

988
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:44,460
weeks is going to go into greater detail

989
00:38:42,358 --> 00:38:46,259
on that question but really quick

990
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:49,019
there's pros and cons of each right

991
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:49,920
having multiple units

992
00:38:49,019 --> 00:38:52,699
um

993
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:56,338
can have a benefit in terms of

994
00:38:52,699 --> 00:38:59,098
redundancy which is sort of a

995
00:38:56,338 --> 00:39:01,739
what's the right term age like a uh

996
00:38:59,099 --> 00:39:04,200
for 10 plus one it's a subjective term

997
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:06,598
right what redundancy means in the

998
00:39:04,199 --> 00:39:09,059
Cannabis industry with equipment and so

999
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:13,320
having multiple units can have its

1000
00:39:09,059 --> 00:39:15,239
benefit but it also makes control and

1001
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:17,880
compressor staging a little bit more

1002
00:39:15,239 --> 00:39:19,679
complicated and it increases the

1003
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:23,099
installation cost because you just have

1004
00:39:19,679 --> 00:39:25,858
more ductwork to run more power drops

1005
00:39:23,099 --> 00:39:28,500
more gas drops

1006
00:39:25,858 --> 00:39:30,799
and you know can can make a little bit

1007
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:33,780
more complicated but with a single unit

1008
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:35,640
you can reduce some of those costs the

1009
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:38,760
controls become a little bit more

1010
00:39:35,639 --> 00:39:40,259
simplified and you know yeah you might

1011
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:43,140
have

1012
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:45,060
less units in terms of redundancy but a

1013
00:39:43,139 --> 00:39:46,618
lot of redundancy can be built into a

1014
00:39:45,059 --> 00:39:49,019
single unit by adding multiple

1015
00:39:46,619 --> 00:39:50,760
Refrigeration circuits so that if one

1016
00:39:49,019 --> 00:39:52,259
goes down you still don't lose all your

1017
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:54,359
capacity

1018
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:56,820
um redundant you know and a critical

1019
00:39:54,358 --> 00:39:59,098
part uh like spare parts on the Shelf

1020
00:39:56,820 --> 00:40:01,740
just in case like and regular

1021
00:39:59,099 --> 00:40:04,260
maintenance so it really depends again

1022
00:40:01,739 --> 00:40:07,679
it's all a balance between

1023
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:10,400
risk reduction and cost

1024
00:40:07,679 --> 00:40:10,399
basically

1025
00:40:10,679 --> 00:40:15,480
yeah yeah I think you you really nailed

1026
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:17,700
it there Anders it's it's a it's a wide

1027
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:19,920
range and it's really understanding what

1028
00:40:17,699 --> 00:40:21,539
what does redundancy mean for a

1029
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:23,519
particular cultivator or cultivation

1030
00:40:21,539 --> 00:40:25,800
business

1031
00:40:23,519 --> 00:40:27,300
um really most importantly first and try

1032
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,740
to start there understand what the

1033
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:30,660
budget requirements or restrictions

1034
00:40:28,739 --> 00:40:33,838
might be around it

1035
00:40:30,659 --> 00:40:37,319
um I think this overall system size and

1036
00:40:33,838 --> 00:40:39,779
scale offers ability to

1037
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:42,720
um in some in many ways more

1038
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:45,180
inexpensively include additional points

1039
00:40:42,719 --> 00:40:48,000
of redundancy into a system

1040
00:40:45,179 --> 00:40:49,919
um than it may on a smaller scale or

1041
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,619
with a hydronic type system as an

1042
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:55,619
example compared to individual DX type

1043
00:40:52,619 --> 00:40:57,660
units package units or split systems

1044
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:59,099
um so there's a there's a there's a lot

1045
00:40:57,659 --> 00:41:01,858
of different factors to consider there

1046
00:40:59,099 --> 00:41:05,280
and it really is is US putting on our

1047
00:41:01,858 --> 00:41:08,460
our owners hat and our fiduciary hat

1048
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:10,440
um as if if as if it was our money and

1049
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:13,740
working together with both the design

1050
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:14,940
team and and the ownership group

1051
00:41:13,739 --> 00:41:16,319
um to really come up with the right

1052
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:19,019
solution

1053
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:23,280
um but it's a we see a really wide uh

1054
00:41:19,019 --> 00:41:26,460
spectrum of ways to combat redundant C

1055
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:28,859
or backup risk reduction

1056
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:30,659
risk mitigation really as it comes to to

1057
00:41:28,858 --> 00:41:31,799
that at the end of the day and I'm

1058
00:41:30,659 --> 00:41:33,779
really glad energy brought up

1059
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:36,180
preventative maintenance

1060
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:38,160
um and the the necessity to maintain

1061
00:41:36,179 --> 00:41:41,039
these systems these systems should work

1062
00:41:38,159 --> 00:41:43,500
and operate as designed for their useful

1063
00:41:41,039 --> 00:41:45,900
life all the time as long as they are

1064
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:47,699
well maintained and that you know that

1065
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:49,079
that's just that's the caveat there that

1066
00:41:47,699 --> 00:41:51,539
that you really always have to make sure

1067
00:41:49,079 --> 00:41:53,579
uh that you're staying in front of

1068
00:41:51,539 --> 00:41:54,900
you I can't set it and forget it yeah

1069
00:41:53,579 --> 00:41:57,119
just like plants you can't ignore them

1070
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:58,740
they need to be cared for and service to

1071
00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:00,539
maintain just like the system serving

1072
00:41:58,739 --> 00:42:03,659
them

1073
00:42:00,539 --> 00:42:05,820
got another good question here on

1074
00:42:03,659 --> 00:42:08,039
the Dynamics of these spaces and the

1075
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:10,500
transition between lights on and lights

1076
00:42:08,039 --> 00:42:12,480
off uh given the transition from lights

1077
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:14,519
on to lights off is such a great

1078
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:16,740
struggle for mechanical systems do you

1079
00:42:14,519 --> 00:42:20,039
see any reason why it wouldn't help to

1080
00:42:16,739 --> 00:42:22,078
dim on and dim off over a period

1081
00:42:20,039 --> 00:42:23,639
for instance the first and last half

1082
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:26,099
hour of the photo period so the spike

1083
00:42:23,639 --> 00:42:28,259
and temps are not as severe

1084
00:42:26,099 --> 00:42:30,240
yeah that's a good question basically

1085
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:33,060
sun setting and sun rising and

1086
00:42:30,239 --> 00:42:35,819
sunsetting your lighting fixtures to not

1087
00:42:33,059 --> 00:42:37,199
have such a dramatic and drastic uh you

1088
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:38,579
know heat change or heat gain in the

1089
00:42:37,199 --> 00:42:40,618
space

1090
00:42:38,579 --> 00:42:42,539
um yeah I mean again there's pros and

1091
00:42:40,619 --> 00:42:44,760
cons to that from a mechanical system

1092
00:42:42,539 --> 00:42:47,579
perspective it can be a con a pro

1093
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:50,220
because you are easing that load in and

1094
00:42:47,579 --> 00:42:53,220
allowing that unit to catch up a little

1095
00:42:50,219 --> 00:42:54,959
bit easier in terms of its capacity and

1096
00:42:53,219 --> 00:42:58,318
ability to

1097
00:42:54,960 --> 00:43:01,139
it's speed to hit set point

1098
00:42:58,318 --> 00:43:03,239
um however from a plant perspective or

1099
00:43:01,139 --> 00:43:05,759
an optimizing a cultivation perspective

1100
00:43:03,239 --> 00:43:08,639
every time you Dim your lights you're

1101
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:10,079
sacrificing the total daily Photon

1102
00:43:08,639 --> 00:43:13,739
uptake of your canopy or What's called

1103
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:16,380
the DLI and so every time you sacrifice

1104
00:43:13,739 --> 00:43:19,078
light you sacrifice yield essentially by

1105
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:20,760
a little bit every time I personally as

1106
00:43:19,079 --> 00:43:22,800
a cultivator never been a phantom son

1107
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:24,839
rising in sunsetting my lights I like to

1108
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:26,940
go full bore at lights on full bore

1109
00:43:24,838 --> 00:43:29,159
lights off but that's if I have the

1110
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:29,940
right mechanical systems

1111
00:43:29,159 --> 00:43:32,879
um

1112
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:34,500
and I just want to maximize that DLI in

1113
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:37,800
total amount of photons that hit my

1114
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:39,119
canopy per day so there's situations for

1115
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:41,220
all of them the way I think about it is

1116
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:44,818
things like ramping up and down is a

1117
00:43:41,219 --> 00:43:46,679
tool and so if it requires it

1118
00:43:44,818 --> 00:43:48,539
yeah use it as a tool as a grower in

1119
00:43:46,679 --> 00:43:50,940
your back pocket if you don't need it

1120
00:43:48,539 --> 00:43:55,219
and you can maintain set point push your

1121
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:55,220
plants push them hard and get that yield

1122
00:43:55,619 --> 00:44:00,900
that's awesome

1123
00:43:57,539 --> 00:44:02,940
it's a great great answer uh got another

1124
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:04,139
one here is our significant heat gain

1125
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:06,659
from the plants that should be

1126
00:44:04,139 --> 00:44:08,818
considered in the sensible load also the

1127
00:44:06,659 --> 00:44:10,500
sensible calc assumed all light wattage

1128
00:44:08,818 --> 00:44:11,880
contributes to the sensible lobe should

1129
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:13,559
a factor be applied if a lighting

1130
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:15,300
manufacturer can provide the actual heat

1131
00:44:13,559 --> 00:44:17,279
given off or just assume worst case

1132
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:19,859
scenario

1133
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:20,760
yeah so two questions there both good

1134
00:44:19,858 --> 00:44:21,358
ones

1135
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:23,460
um

1136
00:44:21,358 --> 00:44:24,779
hey how about I handle the first one you

1137
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:25,858
want to handle the second

1138
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:29,220
sure

1139
00:44:25,858 --> 00:44:32,699
so is there a heat gain from the plants

1140
00:44:29,219 --> 00:44:34,858
uh for the sensible load well because of

1141
00:44:32,699 --> 00:44:36,598
the the evaporative cooling effect of

1142
00:44:34,858 --> 00:44:38,400
transpiration they actually have a

1143
00:44:36,599 --> 00:44:40,859
cooling capacity associated with their

1144
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:42,720
canopy when they're transpiring plants

1145
00:44:40,858 --> 00:44:44,578
aren't necessarily generating any heat

1146
00:44:42,719 --> 00:44:48,239
they're actually cooling the air around

1147
00:44:44,579 --> 00:44:49,140
them I've actually as an exercise

1148
00:44:48,239 --> 00:44:51,419
um

1149
00:44:49,139 --> 00:44:53,578
calculated how many square feet of

1150
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:56,280
canopy can equate to one ton of cooling

1151
00:44:53,579 --> 00:44:58,980
capacity you know and given like

1152
00:44:56,280 --> 00:45:01,800
theoretical Maxes and flowering under uh

1153
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:04,079
of transpiration or a thousand ppfd I

1154
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:06,660
think it was between 150 or 200 square

1155
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:08,339
feet of flowering canopy at Peak can

1156
00:45:06,659 --> 00:45:10,699
equate to almost one ton of coolant

1157
00:45:08,338 --> 00:45:12,659
capacity obviously that's more of a

1158
00:45:10,699 --> 00:45:16,019
instantaneous thing that'll happen and

1159
00:45:12,659 --> 00:45:18,179
not be consistently cooling the room

1160
00:45:16,019 --> 00:45:20,039
um but to answer your question though

1161
00:45:18,179 --> 00:45:22,618
there's no heat gain if anything the

1162
00:45:20,039 --> 00:45:24,779
plant's transpiration rates offset

1163
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:27,119
um you know our help the coolant

1164
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:28,500
capacity that's required

1165
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:29,760
that age you want to talk about the

1166
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:32,039
lights and the

1167
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:33,540
yeah I mean I guess I'm yeah I'm

1168
00:45:32,039 --> 00:45:34,920
assuming this is this is sort of

1169
00:45:33,539 --> 00:45:36,719
suggesting that the drivers would be

1170
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:37,980
mounted outside of the the cultivation

1171
00:45:36,719 --> 00:45:40,739
space

1172
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:43,380
um in that situation and um if that if

1173
00:45:40,739 --> 00:45:45,419
that is indeed the case then we can we

1174
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:47,579
can take that take that first you know

1175
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:51,119
percentage off I mean what are we

1176
00:45:47,579 --> 00:45:52,920
talking about 10 to 15 potentially

1177
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:56,099
um of that overall

1178
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:58,079
um heat load could be you know moved um

1179
00:45:56,099 --> 00:45:59,400
outside of the space

1180
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:01,019
um I think it's important to consider

1181
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:04,260
and make sure that you know that you now

1182
00:46:01,019 --> 00:46:06,539
need to include that heat load in that

1183
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:08,220
uh calculation for whatever system is

1184
00:46:06,539 --> 00:46:10,559
serving that space outside of it

1185
00:46:08,219 --> 00:46:12,779
especially if it's a common hallway

1186
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:14,880
Corridor you know

1187
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:17,280
um interstitial type space or something

1188
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:19,260
that could be open to potentially all of

1189
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:21,000
the flower rooms and you know multiple

1190
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:22,920
rooms of lighting at the same time you

1191
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:25,858
know that'll start to add up

1192
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:27,720
um so it really it is important to make

1193
00:46:25,858 --> 00:46:30,420
sure that we focus on what is inside of

1194
00:46:27,719 --> 00:46:32,279
the space there um and if there's

1195
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:34,079
there's an opportunity to take advantage

1196
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:35,819
of a little bit of reduction then that's

1197
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:37,800
uh that's something that can be done

1198
00:46:35,818 --> 00:46:39,659
well and there's also driver losses to

1199
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:41,940
be considered like an LED fixtures and

1200
00:46:39,659 --> 00:46:44,338
with hvs fixtures because they're not

1201
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:45,659
100 efficient right and so there's a

1202
00:46:44,338 --> 00:46:47,519
number of ways you can get that you get

1203
00:46:45,659 --> 00:46:48,598
it from manufacturer

1204
00:46:47,519 --> 00:46:51,239
um you can try and reach it yourself

1205
00:46:48,599 --> 00:46:54,000
with you know a thick microwave Port

1206
00:46:51,239 --> 00:46:56,459
Joule efficiencies and ppf ratings from

1207
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:58,559
cut sheets you can start calculating

1208
00:46:56,460 --> 00:47:01,199
these driver losses

1209
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:03,539
I think a thousand watt HPS fixture is

1210
00:47:01,199 --> 00:47:05,098
something like 1050 Watts actually than

1211
00:47:03,539 --> 00:47:07,460
a day or something I forget exactly

1212
00:47:05,099 --> 00:47:07,460
right

1213
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:13,199
okay good deal another question here on

1214
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:14,400
on equipment maintenance what should the

1215
00:47:13,199 --> 00:47:17,219
maintenance on your systems look like

1216
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:18,720
how often is it recommended are there

1217
00:47:17,219 --> 00:47:22,919
any special differences between your

1218
00:47:18,719 --> 00:47:24,419
systems and regular HVAC rooftop units

1219
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:26,099
yeah that's a that's a really great

1220
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:27,480
question I can jump on that one if you

1221
00:47:26,099 --> 00:47:31,559
like Anders

1222
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:34,139
um in general uh technicians that know

1223
00:47:31,559 --> 00:47:36,858
and understand and refrigeration systems

1224
00:47:34,139 --> 00:47:40,318
and packaged systems or split systems

1225
00:47:36,858 --> 00:47:43,799
particularly that have hot gas reheat in

1226
00:47:40,318 --> 00:47:45,539
them and modulation and as far as you

1227
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:48,839
know modulating compressors modulating

1228
00:47:45,539 --> 00:47:50,579
Hot Gas reheat valves things like that

1229
00:47:48,838 --> 00:47:53,039
um obviously that that expertise really

1230
00:47:50,579 --> 00:47:55,140
is required in order

1231
00:47:53,039 --> 00:47:57,838
um you know to I would use that as sort

1232
00:47:55,139 --> 00:48:00,420
of some of the early criteria when

1233
00:47:57,838 --> 00:48:01,980
you're vetting a particular maintenance

1234
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:04,619
contractor

1235
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:06,659
um outside of that of making sure that

1236
00:48:04,619 --> 00:48:08,880
you that you choose the right contractor

1237
00:48:06,659 --> 00:48:11,159
or somebody that has experience uh

1238
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:12,838
working on that type of equipment

1239
00:48:11,159 --> 00:48:14,759
um the things that that we really find

1240
00:48:12,838 --> 00:48:16,679
into there's there's not a whole lot of

1241
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:19,079
things that are so different in general

1242
00:48:16,679 --> 00:48:22,858
I feel like outside of the frequency

1243
00:48:19,079 --> 00:48:25,980
that you would want to be involved there

1244
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:28,858
um particularly at the beginning of the

1245
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:30,838
facility startup and really

1246
00:48:28,858 --> 00:48:32,460
understanding and making sure that the

1247
00:48:30,838 --> 00:48:35,039
systems are closely monitored and

1248
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:38,280
maintained during what would be a

1249
00:48:35,039 --> 00:48:41,699
typical commissioning type process pre-

1250
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:44,700
first run and then really uh you know

1251
00:48:41,699 --> 00:48:46,500
sort of a confirmation and a almost a

1252
00:48:44,699 --> 00:48:48,299
recommissioning or retro commissioning

1253
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:50,880
of that system to make sure that through

1254
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:53,220
that first run and once you plant for

1255
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:54,720
the second run your system's still

1256
00:48:53,219 --> 00:48:56,039
operating the way that it was designed

1257
00:48:54,719 --> 00:48:58,259
and set up

1258
00:48:56,039 --> 00:49:02,940
um and a particular item that we see

1259
00:48:58,260 --> 00:49:05,040
often is Filters loading much quicker

1260
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:07,139
than anticipated

1261
00:49:05,039 --> 00:49:09,059
um or not changing out filters from the

1262
00:49:07,139 --> 00:49:11,759
construction and having a lot of

1263
00:49:09,059 --> 00:49:13,799
construction dust clogging filters and

1264
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:15,960
not you know not understanding why we're

1265
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:17,160
not getting full capacity out of the

1266
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:19,139
systems

1267
00:49:17,159 --> 00:49:21,420
um you know near near the beginning of

1268
00:49:19,139 --> 00:49:22,799
that first flower run or halfway through

1269
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:24,599
the first flower run as they continue to

1270
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:26,339
load up um so those are those are some

1271
00:49:24,599 --> 00:49:29,640
of the particular things that we really

1272
00:49:26,338 --> 00:49:32,400
see often that would be important to to

1273
00:49:29,639 --> 00:49:34,259
follow through with and focus on

1274
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:36,119
um and I think you know in general you

1275
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:37,859
know most most preventative maintenance

1276
00:49:36,119 --> 00:49:39,660
service Agreements are typically four

1277
00:49:37,858 --> 00:49:41,818
times a year like quarterly type

1278
00:49:39,659 --> 00:49:45,358
maintenance you know I I would expand

1279
00:49:41,818 --> 00:49:47,219
that to every other month or once a

1280
00:49:45,358 --> 00:49:49,739
month at least for the first six months

1281
00:49:47,219 --> 00:49:50,939
to really use it as a way to get to know

1282
00:49:49,739 --> 00:49:52,379
your service provider have the service

1283
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:54,900
provider get to know you and your

1284
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:57,960
facility and your operation and your

1285
00:49:54,900 --> 00:50:01,200
particular cycle and needs both during

1286
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:03,300
cycles and in between Cycles

1287
00:50:01,199 --> 00:50:04,679
um and to make sure that they know if

1288
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:06,780
there's anything that needs to be done

1289
00:50:04,679 --> 00:50:09,919
whether it be any sort of warranty work

1290
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:12,240
or repair work that needs to be done

1291
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:13,619
they'll know exactly when that can be

1292
00:50:12,239 --> 00:50:15,779
done and can be scheduled in between

1293
00:50:13,619 --> 00:50:17,519
runs in advance so that everybody's

1294
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:20,599
coordinated those are the sort of things

1295
00:50:17,519 --> 00:50:23,219
that we find really really uh helpful

1296
00:50:20,599 --> 00:50:25,559
one last note there on that question is

1297
00:50:23,219 --> 00:50:28,259
another another good opportunity to

1298
00:50:25,559 --> 00:50:30,299
service equipment a good reason to is if

1299
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:32,160
you're operating air-cooled DX equipment

1300
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:34,500
in Northern climates or very cold

1301
00:50:32,159 --> 00:50:37,440
climates with this equipment being

1302
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:39,780
outside like if it's a package DX you

1303
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:41,940
know air-cooled system and you're going

1304
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:44,940
to be operating that in low ambient

1305
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:46,980
conditions during the winter just

1306
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:48,659
it would be a good opportunity to

1307
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:51,000
service and make sure that everything is

1308
00:50:48,659 --> 00:50:53,098
operating you know up to up to spec

1309
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,358
before you enter those cold climate

1310
00:50:53,099 --> 00:50:56,760
months

1311
00:50:54,358 --> 00:50:58,259
yeah that's a great Point yes from a

1312
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:59,880
seasonal perspective I mean another

1313
00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:02,280
opportunity situation is like large

1314
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:04,380
large-scale curing drying and curing

1315
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:05,640
potentially that may happen you know if

1316
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:07,619
you if you have more of a seasonal

1317
00:51:05,639 --> 00:51:09,659
business where the systems aren't

1318
00:51:07,619 --> 00:51:12,980
running all of the year it's really

1319
00:51:09,659 --> 00:51:17,219
important to do sort of a you know a a

1320
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:19,260
particular Focus pre you know operation

1321
00:51:17,219 --> 00:51:21,598
for the season and then somewhat of a

1322
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:23,700
decommissioning of the system and

1323
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:25,260
maintenance after the season and then

1324
00:51:23,699 --> 00:51:28,098
you know again be able to repeat that

1325
00:51:25,260 --> 00:51:28,099
cycle the following year

1326
00:51:28,318 --> 00:51:33,058
also choose a good contractor a good

1327
00:51:30,719 --> 00:51:35,879
experienced contractor with the track

1328
00:51:33,059 --> 00:51:40,440
record and commercial industrial trades

1329
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:43,079
it's so critical to the

1330
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:45,539
operation of your HVAC systems

1331
00:51:43,079 --> 00:51:48,059
particularly the way that they were

1332
00:51:45,539 --> 00:51:51,358
installed and the quality of the duct

1333
00:51:48,059 --> 00:51:54,359
work and uh reducing the static pressure

1334
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:56,098
along those duct runs and

1335
00:51:54,358 --> 00:52:00,239
um we've seen good and we've seen bad

1336
00:51:56,099 --> 00:52:02,400
and uh it can have a very

1337
00:52:00,239 --> 00:52:04,558
they can play a very critical role in

1338
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:07,139
the performance of your facility even if

1339
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:09,119
the HVAC units are right-sized yeah

1340
00:52:07,139 --> 00:52:10,679
that's really great really great points

1341
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:13,079
I mean it's you know that design is

1342
00:52:10,679 --> 00:52:14,639
perfect on paper until you get it out

1343
00:52:13,079 --> 00:52:16,440
and install it out in the field right

1344
00:52:14,639 --> 00:52:18,900
and and so you gotta you gotta make sure

1345
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:22,200
you maintain those standards

1346
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:24,358
um and uh we have a great a network of

1347
00:52:22,199 --> 00:52:26,279
service technicians um and service

1348
00:52:24,358 --> 00:52:29,598
companies across the country that we'd

1349
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:32,640
be happy to refer Partners to

1350
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:34,019
here's an interesting one uh what is

1351
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:36,539
your team's perspective on how

1352
00:52:34,019 --> 00:52:39,599
Standalone dehumidifiers slash split

1353
00:52:36,539 --> 00:52:40,980
systems measure the room temp and Rh and

1354
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:45,260
how does that impact the Growers

1355
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:45,260
perspective on how the room is operating

1356
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:49,318
standard dehumidifier some split systems

1357
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:50,700
measure the room temp I think another

1358
00:52:49,318 --> 00:52:52,558
way you could think of that is

1359
00:52:50,699 --> 00:52:55,078
regardless of the type of system

1360
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:57,119
measuring a room I think what you're

1361
00:52:55,079 --> 00:53:00,000
trying to get at is how does the

1362
00:52:57,119 --> 00:53:02,280
accuracy of a sensor the quantity of the

1363
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:04,699
sensors in that room and the placement

1364
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:08,160
of sensors affect a Grower's perspective

1365
00:53:04,699 --> 00:53:10,259
on how their room is operating and that

1366
00:53:08,159 --> 00:53:12,960
is a very important uh a very good

1367
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:14,819
question and a very important point if

1368
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:16,980
you have a single sensor hung in the

1369
00:53:14,818 --> 00:53:19,019
middle of the room and you're operating

1370
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:20,818
you know thousands of canopy square feet

1371
00:53:19,019 --> 00:53:22,980
off that you're not going to have a very

1372
00:53:20,818 --> 00:53:25,440
good statistically significant picture

1373
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:27,719
of what's going on in the space so

1374
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:30,539
ideally you want to have sensors within

1375
00:53:27,719 --> 00:53:32,338
the canopy that are protected from the

1376
00:53:30,539 --> 00:53:36,000
radiation influences of the lighting

1377
00:53:32,338 --> 00:53:37,940
fixtures and protected from moisture or

1378
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:40,920
damage from staff

1379
00:53:37,940 --> 00:53:42,659
and aren't completely surrounded by wet

1380
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:45,059
plant material we want a representative

1381
00:53:42,659 --> 00:53:46,858
picture of what the plants are actually

1382
00:53:45,059 --> 00:53:49,319
feeling so as close most of the canopy

1383
00:53:46,858 --> 00:53:51,299
as possible to get an accurate

1384
00:53:49,318 --> 00:53:53,400
measurement and then having a number of

1385
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:57,119
those throughout a room to then get an

1386
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:59,940
average and run your systems at is much

1387
00:53:57,119 --> 00:54:01,559
better than operating off of say A you

1388
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:03,119
know a thermostat that's built into a

1389
00:54:01,559 --> 00:54:04,980
mini split hung up on the side of the

1390
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:06,358
wall I mean the conditions on the side

1391
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:08,099
of the wall are not what I'm trying to

1392
00:54:06,358 --> 00:54:09,960
control I'm trying to control the canopy

1393
00:54:08,099 --> 00:54:13,920
so that's where I want my sensors to be

1394
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:16,318
and also if those sensors are skewed and

1395
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:19,019
not near the canopy then we're not going

1396
00:54:16,318 --> 00:54:22,079
to get an accurate VPD calculation at

1397
00:54:19,019 --> 00:54:24,539
all right and so getting those good

1398
00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:26,818
averages from the

1399
00:54:24,539 --> 00:54:28,318
broom conditions as well as the leaf

1400
00:54:26,818 --> 00:54:30,719
temperature and the space will get you

1401
00:54:28,318 --> 00:54:31,980
the most accurate VPD calculation and

1402
00:54:30,719 --> 00:54:33,480
then also having sensors that are

1403
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:35,519
calibrated

1404
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:38,818
um you know we use like nist what were

1405
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:39,960
they like nist calibrated uh handhelds

1406
00:54:38,818 --> 00:54:42,838
you know these like

1407
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:45,420
the calibrate every sensor and you know

1408
00:54:42,838 --> 00:54:47,099
everything so it's very important to

1409
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:49,680
You're only as good as the data you

1410
00:54:47,099 --> 00:54:51,240
collect and measure you know and

1411
00:54:49,679 --> 00:54:53,219
if you're not getting good data then

1412
00:54:51,239 --> 00:54:55,078
you're making bad decisions I actually

1413
00:54:53,219 --> 00:54:57,000
think a lot of Growers perceptions on

1414
00:54:55,079 --> 00:54:59,339
how they were operating rooms 10 years

1415
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:02,460
ago like myself were skewed based on

1416
00:54:59,338 --> 00:55:04,619
that information like I think we thought

1417
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:05,880
we were running a room a certain way but

1418
00:55:04,619 --> 00:55:09,059
in reality it was a way different

1419
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:11,039
condition than we realized because we

1420
00:55:09,059 --> 00:55:13,319
didn't you know back even 10 years ago

1421
00:55:11,039 --> 00:55:15,719
sensors and controls were significantly

1422
00:55:13,318 --> 00:55:18,960
more expensive so now with them being

1423
00:55:15,719 --> 00:55:21,419
more affordable we can get better and

1424
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:22,858
more information cheaper and get better

1425
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:25,440
results

1426
00:55:22,858 --> 00:55:27,779
yeah that's really really exciting what

1427
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:30,720
what the Innovation is going on on that

1428
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:34,519
side of it and the ability to

1429
00:55:30,719 --> 00:55:34,519
ability to get accurate data

1430
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:39,539
yep it's uh amazing the difference

1431
00:55:37,679 --> 00:55:42,779
between uh the reading from a thermostat

1432
00:55:39,539 --> 00:55:45,179
on the wall versus uh temperature sensor

1433
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:46,680
in the canopy what we'll read

1434
00:55:45,179 --> 00:55:48,539
and uh

1435
00:55:46,679 --> 00:55:49,618
and throughout your space and it's you

1436
00:55:48,539 --> 00:55:51,838
know it's more things that we'll we'll

1437
00:55:49,619 --> 00:55:54,300
touch on in part two around you know

1438
00:55:51,838 --> 00:55:55,980
sensor density and and the data as well

1439
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:57,539
as airflow

1440
00:55:55,980 --> 00:55:59,880
um through the space but you know

1441
00:55:57,539 --> 00:56:01,679
there's really you know outside of going

1442
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:03,420
through and checking on your own

1443
00:56:01,679 --> 00:56:05,279
periodically

1444
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:08,818
um you know you don't have a way to know

1445
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:11,220
how homogeneous that that uh canopy is

1446
00:56:08,818 --> 00:56:13,739
want to thank everybody for attending

1447
00:56:11,219 --> 00:56:15,719
today and all of the interactive

1448
00:56:13,739 --> 00:56:17,699
excellent thought-provoking questions

1449
00:56:15,719 --> 00:56:20,279
that came up

1450
00:56:17,699 --> 00:56:22,379
um of course Anders and Adrian thank you

1451
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:24,000
for uh participating for presenting

1452
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:25,559
today

1453
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,719
thank you everyone really appreciate

1454
00:56:25,559 --> 00:56:30,380
