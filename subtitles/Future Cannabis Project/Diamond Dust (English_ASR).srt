1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,068
your babies which are your genetics that

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:09,240
you've read can you talk about kind of

3
00:00:05,068 --> 00:00:11,910
like what you've read where you've got

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:15,660
like the parents from why you love it

5
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:16,948
how it grows how it smokes right now I

6
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,410
wonder should be your favorite today

7
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:22,618
because my favorite is the diamond dust

8
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:24,839
this diamond does was a so I actually

9
00:00:22,618 --> 00:00:26,849
created something called the homeless

10
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:29,518
matrix some of mask actual that's my

11
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:32,308
background so I create a matrix that you

12
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:34,289
could use to help you make selections

13
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:36,149
based on terpene profiles is when you

14
00:00:34,289 --> 00:00:39,329
start to look at turkey profiles and you

15
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:41,850
look at 40 turkeys variety okay

16
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:43,590
I know kind of that the spell is well

17
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:45,660
how do I compare all these varieties and

18
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:47,609
make a choice as a breeder yeah so the

19
00:00:45,659 --> 00:00:49,109
homes matrix of something I just created

20
00:00:47,609 --> 00:00:52,829
an algorithm we could type in all the

21
00:00:49,109 --> 00:00:55,558
terpene profiles and give you points

22
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:57,448
into the direction of a choice that

23
00:00:55,558 --> 00:00:59,939
suits you sure sure

24
00:00:57,448 --> 00:01:02,039
like as a consumer or Isaac as a breeder

25
00:00:59,939 --> 00:01:05,518
as a breeder like what I'm looking to

26
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:08,489
our producer to consumer also as like a

27
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,740
you know I'm developing varieties for

28
00:01:08,489 --> 00:01:12,478
consumers cool we know Lori but this is

29
00:01:10,739 --> 00:01:14,719
you're not like they like a not like for

30
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:17,120
like a medical bag

31
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:18,530
it's one experience with what experience

32
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:21,560
and you know a lot of times that is a

33
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:23,390
medical planning experience but yeah I

34
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:25,939
mean it's just whatever the consumer

35
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:30,280
wants us to develop something that they

36
00:01:25,939 --> 00:01:32,590
like and it's yeah it could be relaxing

37
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:34,829
could be whatever it is those are there

38
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:36,840
certain Turkic composite scenes

39
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:39,120
geared towards them some battles we're

40
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,250
looking at those types of things so but

41
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:43,680
in terms of over of a variety that I

42
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:45,150
develop the diamond dust is one of my

43
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,600
favorites because it's the first drain

44
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:50,250
that I really got to use that that that

45
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:52,949
algorithm that helped point me in the

46
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:55,829
right direction on the turf inside but

47
00:01:52,950 --> 00:02:00,090
it's essentially a double dream lemonade

48
00:01:55,829 --> 00:02:02,099
bubble gum I rigged with sour bottle and

49
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:04,560
and it just it happens to be right in

50
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:07,409
the middle it's like between like that

51
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,210
really heavy Baba kind of sedative

52
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:12,389
effect and the really kind of like

53
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:15,180
uplifting sativa really balanced ivory

54
00:02:12,389 --> 00:02:18,029
right in the middle and it's beautiful

55
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:20,500
in terms of like the structure it has

56
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:22,750
really high trichrome production

57
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:25,180
and it's a good yielder and it's real

58
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:27,729
vigorous introduction and the effect is

59
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:30,250
really balanced so it kind of has all

60
00:02:27,729 --> 00:02:33,879
the trifecta the turkey means size the

61
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:36,020
effect has the aesthetic and it's been a

62
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:40,400
great variety we're running it

63
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:43,580
and everybody loves that's my favorite

64
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:46,099
constraint what's the trick

65
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:51,460
the terpene profile is um it's kind of

66
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:55,280
like a sweet Bubba but it it's mainly

67
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:57,760
limonene Jerry awfully near seemed like

68
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,759
most things

69
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:02,879
but that's a little bit of a bump it's

70
00:03:00,009 --> 00:03:02,878
like a sweetheart

71
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,599
the funny thing is it's kind of like you

72
00:03:05,128 --> 00:03:09,899
know breathing is a long-term project

73
00:03:06,598 --> 00:03:12,268
it's only like one step yeah first he

74
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,890
was taken - yeah to get to like where

75
00:03:12,269 --> 00:03:17,189
you want to go the intention of

76
00:03:13,889 --> 00:03:18,809
developing diamond dust which diamond

77
00:03:17,189 --> 00:03:20,818
dust is just one stuff in kind of the

78
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:23,370
progression to getting there I've always

79
00:03:20,818 --> 00:03:24,750
wanted develop an OG turf profile a

80
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:26,090
variety that's not

81
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:29,659
[Music]

82
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:31,700
just because like that that that terpene

83
00:03:29,659 --> 00:03:34,159
profiles so amazing Virginia Tech so

84
00:03:31,699 --> 00:03:35,959
amazing but it just been inbred for so

85
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:38,359
long the structure is bad and sure

86
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:41,449
yields are bad so trying to keep that

87
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:42,830
same terms or flash to start fresh going

88
00:03:41,449 --> 00:03:45,079
in a different direction

89
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:47,630
you know landraces whatever we need to

90
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:49,610
free that new structure that's more

91
00:03:47,629 --> 00:03:53,719
rigorous you know that's less prone to

92
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:56,170
day and still on that term profilin ehe

93
00:03:53,719 --> 00:04:00,039
highs and being from LA that's

94
00:03:56,169 --> 00:04:01,208
Oh G is starting so that's that was kind

95
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:03,159
of the goal of the diamond does that

96
00:04:01,209 --> 00:04:07,860
mean this isn't quite that but that's

97
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:11,199
kind of what motivated the development

98
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:12,940
and who who's been breeding some stuff

99
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:14,979
that you either want to play with or

100
00:04:12,939 --> 00:04:17,290
that you have been playing with there's

101
00:04:14,979 --> 00:04:22,259
there's a lot of great breeders

102
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:22,260
I love CS I'm humbled calculator

103
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:27,610
genetics I mean too many to name there's

104
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:30,730
a lot of great breeders doing great work

105
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:32,650
but unfortunately I only have so much

106
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:35,199
candy I wish I had you know a million

107
00:04:32,649 --> 00:04:37,549
square feet

108
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,960
that's right that's what it takes that

109
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:40,850
it takes you to the next level really

110
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:42,469
it's all about numbers you know but

111
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:44,419
we're trying to be as smart as we can

112
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:47,090
with without the numbers that's really

113
00:04:44,418 --> 00:04:48,829
all we could do at this it's you know

114
00:04:47,089 --> 00:04:51,138
it's funny that's something that it's

115
00:04:48,829 --> 00:04:53,300
actually part of my we talked to her you

116
00:04:51,139 --> 00:04:55,250
know there's this by some folks in the

117
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:57,860
industry like oh we just need like new

118
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:59,418
molecular genomics and stuff like that -

119
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:01,038
like you know laser in on this thing

120
00:04:59,418 --> 00:05:02,959
it's actually like what actually what's

121
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:05,060
the most important to breeding is like

122
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:09,319
looking at a lot of plans yeah yeah it's

123
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:12,288
like it's probably there's only so many

124
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:14,569
phenotypes or traits I have you do the

125
00:05:12,288 --> 00:05:16,759
math on traits right you could calculate

126
00:05:14,569 --> 00:05:19,159
out how many varieties you have to grow

127
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:21,620
to find the variety that's all right dr.

128
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:23,300
Chitra yeah I was trying to tell someone

129
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:25,639
this might not be the most artful way of

130
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:27,500
saying yeah it's like you know breeding

131
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:29,478
is all about how big's is your fun does

132
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:31,279
your funnel start out and like how

133
00:05:29,478 --> 00:05:32,810
effective are you at selected yeah

134
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:35,059
that's that's like the slope of your

135
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:36,598
funnel right yeah and there's so much I

136
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:38,968
wish I can remember the

137
00:05:36,598 --> 00:05:40,949
there's an equation to calculate like

138
00:05:38,968 --> 00:05:44,300
the probability of varieties you have to

139
00:05:40,949 --> 00:05:44,300
run to fine

140
00:05:44,649 --> 00:05:52,219
specific traits right that's kind of

141
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:55,100
what we're looking at it you got a plug

142
00:05:52,220 --> 00:06:00,190
the end and that's how many punch it and

143
00:05:55,100 --> 00:06:04,280
it's big it's really big it's millions

144
00:06:00,189 --> 00:06:05,839
quickly what was the name of your like

145
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:09,198
what your breeding that you like oh

146
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:12,948
diamond does okay so with diamond dust

147
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:16,189
was it just like happenstance or was

148
00:06:12,949 --> 00:06:18,710
like did you just pop a bunch of seeds

149
00:06:16,189 --> 00:06:20,569
and it happened you hit on something

150
00:06:18,709 --> 00:06:22,609
that was a winner or well I mean

151
00:06:20,569 --> 00:06:25,490
starting with good parents is always

152
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:27,110
important right so you know as a breeder

153
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:28,850
you're always standing on the shoulders

154
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:31,220
of giants right and that's all science I

155
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:33,979
mean those guys have been doing work for

156
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:37,310
30 40 years so you have to start with

157
00:06:33,978 --> 00:06:38,810
good parents but then it's you know we

158
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:40,788
just said you have to grow tons of

159
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:43,728
numbers so there's some lucky ball it's

160
00:06:40,788 --> 00:06:44,779
being smart as you can with what numbers

161
00:06:43,728 --> 00:06:47,000
you're allowed

162
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:49,759
but at this stage when you can't run

163
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,529
five million plants there's a little bit

164
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,360
of luck

165
00:06:50,529 --> 00:06:54,409
that's what's so amazing to me about the

166
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,310
breeding that's been done in this place

167
00:06:54,410 --> 00:07:00,200
like you know folks that are like some

168
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:01,610
folks that are like helicoptering into

169
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:03,589
the space now like their first

170
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:05,569
perspective is like oh the breeding is

171
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:07,159
so like amateur and we're gonna displace

172
00:07:05,569 --> 00:07:11,599
it along with it right right and I'm

173
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:13,070
actually like so impressed with but like

174
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:15,080
I'm like so impressed with the work that

175
00:07:13,069 --> 00:07:17,000
breeders have done so far because it's

176
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:18,439
like you take these folks that have like

177
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,600
always been working on they're like

178
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:23,660
super limited resources super limited

179
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:26,900
scale right like and and they've been

180
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:29,300
like super resourceful right super

181
00:07:26,899 --> 00:07:31,639
innovative super creative yeah and

182
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:34,220
that's what like to me I look at that

183
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:36,649
I'm like if you if you take that work

184
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:38,360
and you multiply it by a million what's

185
00:07:36,649 --> 00:07:41,149
gonna happen oh yeah great it's gonna be

186
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:42,770
it's gonna knock our socks yeah the guys

187
00:07:41,149 --> 00:07:45,189
come in and go through the helicopters

188
00:07:42,769 --> 00:07:48,889
[Laughter]

189
00:07:45,189 --> 00:07:50,569
you know if you introduce a bunch of

190
00:07:48,889 --> 00:07:52,610
resources to it well I get you know like

191
00:07:50,569 --> 00:07:54,439
the folks that have taken us to where

192
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:56,560
we're at today are gonna be the folks

193
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:59,449
that they're gonna take us alone

194
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:03,519
I wasn't that passion that's all about

195
00:07:59,449 --> 00:08:06,160
me there's a passion absolutely

196
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:07,689
but with the diamond dust did you go

197
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,870
through iterations where you're like

198
00:08:07,689 --> 00:08:12,728
it's close but it's not there and then

199
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:14,620
you kept kind of like tweaking it

200
00:08:12,728 --> 00:08:17,769
iteratively it was actually the reverse

201
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:19,990
I was excited about the cross and I knew

202
00:08:17,769 --> 00:08:21,848
it had really good parents and you know

203
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:23,228
putting the terpene profiles of the

204
00:08:21,848 --> 00:08:25,598
parents through the matrix I was like

205
00:08:23,228 --> 00:08:28,990
really excited about kind of being the

206
00:08:25,598 --> 00:08:31,418
offspring and then like the first you

207
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:33,339
know 25 seeds I read I found something

208
00:08:31,418 --> 00:08:36,399
amazing and then I was like shit I gotta

209
00:08:33,339 --> 00:08:37,810
get back to that set of seeds and keep

210
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:41,229
running more and I've been running more

211
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:42,939
and more more you know hundreds and now

212
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:44,680
it's like that one's still the best one

213
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:46,300
so it's a little bit of what you talked

214
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:48,338
about probability you know run lots of

215
00:08:46,299 --> 00:08:51,219
glass but I mean you could run a million

216
00:08:48,339 --> 00:08:52,720
plants in the first thousand you find

217
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:54,220
the best one out of a million or it

218
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,290
could be you know nine hundred thousand

219
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:59,230
and fifty eight so you just you just

220
00:08:56,289 --> 00:09:01,000
never know him but you know I was able

221
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:02,709
to put like also like you could look at

222
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,940
a billion plants and if you don't know

223
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:05,259
what you're looking for it's true you're

224
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:07,690
never gonna find a great one

225
00:09:05,259 --> 00:09:09,129
yeah selection is also important and

226
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:12,640
that's that's where you know readers

227
00:09:09,129 --> 00:09:14,549
experience they kind of know what how to

228
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:17,860
select

229
00:09:14,549 --> 00:09:19,539
crucial aspect defeating that's what I

230
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:22,930
mean with that experience that like

231
00:09:19,539 --> 00:09:24,879
intuition yeah you know that's so it's

232
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:32,589
irreplaceable yeah yeah you see guys

233
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:34,529
like choosing this big it's a biomass

234
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:37,899
reducer but it's not you know producing

235
00:09:34,529 --> 00:09:40,649
right so it just depends also on what

236
00:09:37,899 --> 00:09:43,539
the uses - yeah

237
00:09:40,649 --> 00:09:48,639
the selection of the breeder is is very

238
00:09:43,539 --> 00:09:51,179
important the ability just like what do

239
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:55,569
you think about for anything about seats

240
00:09:51,179 --> 00:09:56,620
as a production system I think that were

241
00:09:55,570 --> 00:10:00,250
obviously

242
00:09:56,620 --> 00:10:02,080
a little too early to use these it's

243
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:04,720
like a full production system so I think

244
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:09,129
throughout door for my oh man

245
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:12,540
you know kind of like large-scale

246
00:10:09,129 --> 00:10:15,409
extraction I think it's really

247
00:10:12,539 --> 00:10:19,368
once we have better stability

248
00:10:15,409 --> 00:10:25,068
but eventually I mean shit if I could

249
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:37,009
run everything I know I make loans every

250
00:10:25,068 --> 00:10:38,838
day and I'm like so so the reason you

251
00:10:37,009 --> 00:10:40,548
don't is because you know that's you

252
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:42,349
don't have a consistency that's right

253
00:10:40,548 --> 00:10:44,958
yeah I mean you know like we're

254
00:10:42,349 --> 00:10:48,559
launching a branded package company

255
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:50,508
products flower freerolls whatever veins

256
00:10:48,558 --> 00:10:52,908
so this products have to be consistent

257
00:10:50,509 --> 00:10:53,990
you know when you have thousand seeds

258
00:10:52,908 --> 00:10:55,669
you run over

259
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:57,500
produce flour that you're gonna package

260
00:10:55,669 --> 00:10:59,110
and it's all way different and that's

261
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:01,779
really kind of a sepia

262
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:03,399
in my box of seeds and other varieties

263
00:11:01,779 --> 00:11:06,339
there's there's too much variability

264
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:08,949
because it takes a lot of numbers and a

265
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:12,840
lot of generations that get to stay with

266
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:17,050
seeds that you can write in production

267
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:20,310
well you and I talked before about and

268
00:11:17,049 --> 00:11:22,959
we won't name names but well-known

269
00:11:20,309 --> 00:11:26,169
California indoor cultivators that you

270
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:27,730
respect who when you try their product

271
00:11:26,169 --> 00:11:30,610
from the retail shelves is not

272
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:32,860
consistent and they're probably cloning

273
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:35,490
so like what do you attribute that to

274
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:37,960
well that's a great question and I think

275
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:40,610
part of it is scale right I mean you

276
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:42,410
have guys that are

277
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:44,539
we've been growing for a long time they

278
00:11:42,409 --> 00:11:47,269
do a really good job of producing

279
00:11:44,539 --> 00:11:49,189
product and then the demand gets so high

280
00:11:47,269 --> 00:11:51,379
it's like you have to start sourcing out

281
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:53,600
to other cultivators and then you have

282
00:11:51,379 --> 00:11:55,429
different people in different areas with

283
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,860
different facilities growing the product

284
00:11:55,429 --> 00:12:00,109
same genetics but the environmental

285
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:01,909
differences you know the temperature

286
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:03,829
difference is my adidas these little

287
00:12:01,909 --> 00:12:05,179
differences especially indoors make a

288
00:12:03,828 --> 00:12:07,789
big difference in the quality of the

289
00:12:05,179 --> 00:12:10,609
body so I think it just it's more of

290
00:12:07,789 --> 00:12:12,240
like I didn't accommodation to several

291
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:16,019
factors

292
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:17,970
I demand you know facility design is

293
00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:20,320
different

294
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:22,629
the nutrient

295
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:26,040
all those things expected consistency

296
00:12:22,629 --> 00:12:29,828
other but there's just not enough

297
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:31,179
knowledge of indoor cultivation yet in

298
00:12:29,828 --> 00:12:36,039
terms of

299
00:12:31,179 --> 00:12:37,479
environment stability lighting we're

300
00:12:36,039 --> 00:12:41,049
barely starting to measure those things

301
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:42,789
and how they contribute to a picture

302
00:12:41,049 --> 00:12:46,149
but I mean there's just that just the

303
00:12:42,789 --> 00:12:48,279
holidays facilities are different rooms

304
00:12:46,149 --> 00:12:51,059
are different so rooms are generating

305
00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:51,059
different types of Rob
