2
00:00:12,919 --> 00:00:17,550
so much go on just talk about how things

3
00:00:16,138 --> 00:00:21,210
have changed at the Emerald cup with

4
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:23,310
with the segue from 215 264 last year

5
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:24,719
where do you see it in a year where did

6
00:00:23,309 --> 00:00:27,750
what do you see happening this next year

7
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:30,660
what do you focus on that you know for

8
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:33,269
me I'd say the the primary focus is just

9
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,980
to be able to understand how to make the

10
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:37,559
transition from what we did to what

11
00:00:34,979 --> 00:00:40,049
we're doing because there's no map and

12
00:00:37,558 --> 00:00:42,780
so it's a new industry that you're

13
00:00:40,049 --> 00:00:44,939
creating so nobody really has a book to

14
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:47,520
buy that says this is the steps you take

15
00:00:44,939 --> 00:00:50,429
and if you watch even these large

16
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:53,789
companies make missteps you realize that

17
00:00:50,429 --> 00:00:55,170
it's just a tricky thing so a lot of it

18
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:57,300
is to make sure that you emotionally

19
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:58,739
keep yourself stable so that you can

20
00:00:57,299 --> 00:01:00,269
make the transitions and allow the

21
00:00:58,738 --> 00:01:04,530
businesses that you are able to develop

22
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:06,900
and the pathways through this new maze

23
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:09,180
are able to be presented so you can see

24
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:12,180
them and you know that's the main point

25
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:13,890
is to stay on focus with that and and so

26
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:16,950
that's the reality of you know the new

27
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:18,810
industry but at the same time you know

28
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:20,130
I'm getting to do incredible projects

29
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:22,829
because we're able to work with

30
00:01:20,129 --> 00:01:23,699
scientific technology do we never had

31
00:01:22,829 --> 00:01:25,920
access to before

32
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:27,570
and you're able to work with people from

33
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,400
the new industry coming in it's

34
00:01:27,569 --> 00:01:31,618
everybody all the green rushes right

35
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:33,030
well a lot of the green rushes the green

36
00:01:31,618 --> 00:01:35,159
rushes but a lot of the green rushes are

37
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:38,728
actually pretty good people and they're

38
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:41,280
intelligent and they have a desire to be

39
00:01:38,728 --> 00:01:42,659
in a new industry and they realize their

40
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,759
position because they've been in other

41
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:46,020
industries and they see that this is a

42
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:48,328
different one and they're not trying to

43
00:01:46,019 --> 00:01:49,679
necessarily model this one after the

44
00:01:48,328 --> 00:01:51,359
other ones so much they know that this

45
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,700
will be its own organic development

46
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:55,250
because it's a unique industry and so

47
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:58,710
all of a sudden you get to really have

48
00:01:55,250 --> 00:02:00,280
intelligent data acquisition and genomic

49
00:01:58,709 --> 00:02:03,039
scientists

50
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:05,349
and high-level plant consultants that

51
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,940
work on really intricate large projects

52
00:02:05,349 --> 00:02:09,189
that help you understand some of the

53
00:02:06,939 --> 00:02:12,069
nuances people face at these scales and

54
00:02:09,189 --> 00:02:14,379
at these issues you're having with the

55
00:02:12,069 --> 00:02:16,449
regulations as strict as it is you're

56
00:02:14,379 --> 00:02:18,189
bringing in incredible levels of organic

57
00:02:16,449 --> 00:02:20,379
methodologies so it's brigade's a

58
00:02:18,189 --> 00:02:23,050
resurrection of how does one work

59
00:02:20,379 --> 00:02:24,490
without chemical AG at the same time on

60
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:26,650
the other page it's how do you use the

61
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:28,719
most modern technology to lift the

62
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:31,689
production values and get the the

63
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:33,400
margins into a tighter range so you know

64
00:02:31,689 --> 00:02:34,750
it's fascinating in that respect and for

65
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,909
all of us our industry all these years

66
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:39,580
we always wanted to have the tools to

67
00:02:36,909 --> 00:02:41,020
use but you couldn't and now you can and

68
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:42,280
now that you can it kind of scares the

69
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:45,100
shit idea because you see that they're

70
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:47,050
there but you know that excited about

71
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:50,109
that man I'm digging it and I like that

72
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:51,420
have just is going to move across the

73
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:53,380
board because it will open up

74
00:02:51,419 --> 00:02:56,319
agricultural methodologies throughout

75
00:02:53,379 --> 00:02:59,289
the country for biomass for fibre for

76
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:00,699
hemp seed oil there they'll transfer it

77
00:02:59,289 --> 00:03:03,039
to cannabinoids they'll go back on in

78
00:03:00,699 --> 00:03:04,689
California under the BCC so this way

79
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:07,329
those it allows the farmers that are

80
00:03:04,689 --> 00:03:09,159
growing cannabis and cannabinoids to be

81
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:12,130
able to focus on a multi-use crop not

82
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:14,680
just all THC driven but THC CBD and then

83
00:03:12,129 --> 00:03:18,579
as we go forward you know see BG's THC

84
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:20,140
VCB ends and it'll allow a much more a

85
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:22,090
greater diversity for the cultivator so

86
00:03:20,139 --> 00:03:24,369
you're not all trying to stick

87
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:26,140
oh gee cushion gelato into a jar and

88
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:28,000
sell it at the store but you're able to

89
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:30,429
go at populations that want some very

90
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,530
interesting things because it works for

91
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:34,629
their situation and so all of a sudden

92
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:37,120
now you have a much larger population of

93
00:03:34,629 --> 00:03:38,530
total potential customers and clients so

94
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,810
it isn't like it's gonna compress it's

95
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:42,879
gonna explode so I mean I'm digging it I

96
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:45,699
heard you're working on a bit of a skunk

97
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:47,469
work I mean literally skunk work get

98
00:03:45,699 --> 00:03:50,199
some landrace I'm bringing back all the

99
00:03:47,469 --> 00:03:52,479
old genetics we parted up with a lab

100
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:54,069
note labs out of Petaluma so no labs is

101
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:55,509
our tissue culture facility where we're

102
00:03:54,069 --> 00:03:56,979
gonna do all our tissue culture

103
00:03:55,509 --> 00:03:58,419
production and then we'll move it into

104
00:03:56,979 --> 00:03:59,469
the new Wonderland and develop it there

105
00:03:58,419 --> 00:04:01,689
is for the grow-out

106
00:03:59,469 --> 00:04:04,090
yeah and so when it doesn't lets us have

107
00:04:01,689 --> 00:04:06,609
this ability to use modern tech but I'm

108
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:07,379
using the modern tech to go and open up

109
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:09,960
old sea

110
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:11,430
from the 70s and from populations that

111
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:13,560
were held by people who held them

112
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:15,750
because they really liked it and they

113
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,889
just didn't want to get rid of the seeds

114
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:18,420
but they also knew they couldn't do

115
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:20,488
anything with them well we can go into

116
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:21,900
him now and and and preserve some of

117
00:04:20,488 --> 00:04:24,870
them and pull some of that genealogical

118
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:26,459
material out and use it to steer the

119
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:29,100
directions different those building

120
00:04:26,459 --> 00:04:31,019
blocks we really kind of shifted away

121
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:33,180
from them and and now they're not

122
00:04:31,019 --> 00:04:34,829
present and the thing is that there's

123
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:38,189
all this incredible beautiful material

124
00:04:34,829 --> 00:04:40,050
to be delved into and sort ability to do

125
00:04:38,189 --> 00:04:43,079
that stuff is unreal man so now I can go

126
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:45,060
back to my roots which is a simple guy

127
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:46,319
just want to smoke the grass and then I

128
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,670
can go all the way to the top of the

129
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:51,060
tree which is what touching the touch

130
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:53,220
into some really high science and it's

131
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:54,420
it's this it's an unbelievable time to

132
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:56,550
be able to do it so I mean you're

133
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:58,230
terrified most of the time that these

134
00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:00,750
companies are gonna gobble you alive but

135
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:02,550
at the same time they they need to deal

136
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:04,949
with you to be able to figure out what

137
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:08,160
to do so you really have a very unique

138
00:05:04,949 --> 00:05:10,860
moment in time and I wish I had been in

139
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,780
tech and saw the dot-com in person

140
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:14,250
because I bet it was similar we're in

141
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:16,709
the same room you had all these people

142
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:19,100
just for one period of time before they

143
00:05:16,709 --> 00:05:21,479
all fragmented out into their respective

144
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:22,800
specialities and that's exactly that and

145
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:25,379
that's my background I don't even know

146
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,240
if I should but years ago it was post

147
00:05:25,379 --> 00:05:29,219
mom as we say so it's more than early

148
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:31,769
2000s I got into it but you're spot-on

149
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:33,840
like I felt that I was very fortunate to

150
00:05:31,769 --> 00:05:36,180
be a part of something such an evolution

151
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:37,799
now I think this one's a more important

152
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:40,259
evolution truth be told I'm an advocate

153
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:42,120
from a medicinal side definitely respect

154
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:44,159
the adult use side but I agree with you

155
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:46,740
it is very similar you had these people

156
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,510
there were just these think tanks that

157
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:50,189
they didn't even realize it was so much

158
00:05:48,509 --> 00:05:51,870
bigger than even anyone could understand

159
00:05:50,189 --> 00:05:52,889
or comprehend at the time and again

160
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:54,439
that's what I love about we've had

161
00:05:52,889 --> 00:05:57,599
conversations about that you and I both

162
00:05:54,439 --> 00:06:00,899
where I'm the same way like to see a

163
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:03,450
true Acapulco gold or Northern Lights or

164
00:06:00,899 --> 00:06:05,759
I mean not crossbred not back bred not

165
00:06:03,449 --> 00:06:07,949
because we I loved we talked about this

166
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,779
to these trendy I'm cakes

167
00:06:07,949 --> 00:06:12,300
I know cakes are hot cakes we had

168
00:06:09,779 --> 00:06:13,439
cookies we had the the oh jeez we went

169
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:15,750
through at these Hayes's all these

170
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:17,759
phases over the years but you get into

171
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:19,350
and this is something that I grant no

172
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,278
matter what big company comes into the

173
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:21,899
scene

174
00:06:20,278 --> 00:06:24,658
you're the one who has the keys to this

175
00:06:21,899 --> 00:06:27,389
to this castle that can tell them this

176
00:06:24,658 --> 00:06:29,218
is why the genetics went this direction

177
00:06:27,389 --> 00:06:31,859
this is why everything started shifting

178
00:06:29,218 --> 00:06:34,108
to less punching or to a little more

179
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:35,308
restrained on the on the terpene side

180
00:06:34,108 --> 00:06:37,709
you know a little less flavonoid like

181
00:06:35,309 --> 00:06:39,088
you know that you were there right when

182
00:06:37,709 --> 00:06:41,509
they brought everything in doors post

183
00:06:39,088 --> 00:06:44,788
dere back in the early eighties right so

184
00:06:41,509 --> 00:06:46,199
looking back like are you just not ever

185
00:06:44,788 --> 00:06:48,028
amazed you ever just stop and go oh my

186
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:49,528
god this really just happened and and

187
00:06:48,028 --> 00:06:53,548
not just your lifetime but just the last

188
00:06:49,528 --> 00:06:55,499
20 or throw it's the last couple years

189
00:06:53,548 --> 00:06:58,138
that blew my mind because that was the

190
00:06:55,499 --> 00:06:59,909
change of pace that was fastest yeah it

191
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:02,968
was really pretty stable for a long time

192
00:06:59,908 --> 00:07:05,428
and you had a stability that was built

193
00:07:02,968 --> 00:07:07,618
in from regulation meaning a legal

194
00:07:05,428 --> 00:07:09,838
enforcement and so that gave a price

195
00:07:07,619 --> 00:07:11,129
stabilization which allowed people to be

196
00:07:09,838 --> 00:07:13,288
able to have resources to be able to

197
00:07:11,129 --> 00:07:15,239
operate independently and then when that

198
00:07:13,288 --> 00:07:17,368
got shut out it compressed the industry

199
00:07:15,238 --> 00:07:18,928
and now the new influx of capital and

200
00:07:17,369 --> 00:07:20,999
new people coming in is RIBA lowing it

201
00:07:18,928 --> 00:07:23,128
up here and it's just trying to figure

202
00:07:20,999 --> 00:07:24,499
out you know how do you how do you get

203
00:07:23,129 --> 00:07:27,658
some of these things from the past

204
00:07:24,499 --> 00:07:29,909
genetically speaking culturally speaking

205
00:07:27,658 --> 00:07:34,288
and have them transcend a move forward

206
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:37,139
through time and it's just so strange to

207
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:38,788
be watching it in real time because we

208
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:40,739
had we knew this was coming and we

209
00:07:38,788 --> 00:07:42,808
prepared for it we work with it but no

210
00:07:40,738 --> 00:07:45,838
one ever knows the future in real time

211
00:07:42,809 --> 00:07:46,739
and so that you have no idea what's next

212
00:07:45,838 --> 00:07:49,588
and now we're talking about

213
00:07:46,738 --> 00:07:51,808
synthetically grow interprets and in

214
00:07:49,588 --> 00:07:53,249
East solution and growing cannabinoids

215
00:07:51,809 --> 00:07:55,499
in yeast solutions and we're

216
00:07:53,249 --> 00:07:57,599
manufacturing stuff that we need

217
00:07:55,499 --> 00:08:00,659
specifically in lab for very specific

218
00:07:57,598 --> 00:08:03,449
purposes the genomic the project so we

219
00:08:00,658 --> 00:08:05,459
can start getting stabilized lines going

220
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:06,689
through and developing plant populations

221
00:08:05,459 --> 00:08:09,199
that have high resistance so the

222
00:08:06,689 --> 00:08:12,299
cultivation is easier in a lot of areas

223
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:14,728
going at specific combinations of

224
00:08:12,298 --> 00:08:16,228
cannabinoids interrupts for medicinal

225
00:08:14,728 --> 00:08:19,709
purposes because now you can get

226
00:08:16,228 --> 00:08:21,718
medicinal research expungement on cases

227
00:08:19,709 --> 00:08:23,519
people that got quite a case getting

228
00:08:21,718 --> 00:08:26,009
expungements like and everywhere I mean

229
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:27,989
like on so you're an East Coast guy born

230
00:08:26,009 --> 00:08:29,729
East Coast I was floored when I was

231
00:08:27,988 --> 00:08:32,549
hearing that a place like Mass was

232
00:08:29,728 --> 00:08:33,460
Toronto law we're not I'm like what even

233
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:35,379
the Canadians

234
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:37,420
make sense right yeah the Canadians are

235
00:08:35,379 --> 00:08:39,759
going off yeah but I could see that

236
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:40,750
because you know they it's if they've

237
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:42,279
said hey this is an excellent

238
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:43,870
opportunity for us to enter an industry

239
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:45,129
before the US gets involved is once the

240
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:47,379
u.s. gets involved heavily it's gonna be

241
00:08:45,129 --> 00:08:49,960
hard to compete and it's tough to it's

242
00:08:47,379 --> 00:08:51,549
tough to beat better climate with Ag you

243
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:53,110
know Mexico's killing us with

244
00:08:51,549 --> 00:08:55,269
agricultural products otherwise we'd be

245
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:58,840
exporting to them because they have the

246
00:08:55,269 --> 00:09:00,970
water the flat ground good soil and they

247
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:03,970
they also have a looser labor and

248
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:05,620
environmental controls so it allows them

249
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:09,610
to be more competitive than those things

250
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:11,919
and so Canada to me is the front-runner

251
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:15,220
right now but I don't see the ability to

252
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:19,809
hold that position with Haag technical

253
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:21,250
breeding very specific but not on a

254
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:24,609
broad production once these other

255
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:26,559
countries can start producing so they're

256
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:28,180
in a situation that's different but the

257
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:31,059
East Coast which has been traditionally

258
00:09:28,179 --> 00:09:33,699
draconian so New England's draconian on

259
00:09:31,059 --> 00:09:36,309
cannabis I mean they're bracing a little

260
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:38,350
you know to Fang and claw and and I'm

261
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:40,719
looking at it I'm like whoa because I

262
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:42,040
remember catching a case in 83 and I

263
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,330
said I think I'm good a lot of there in

264
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:46,269
80 I'm out of there when I graduated

265
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:47,560
school in 84 and so I never had a desire

266
00:09:46,269 --> 00:09:49,899
to go back and do cannabis in New

267
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:52,539
England and now right now it is a it's

268
00:09:49,899 --> 00:09:54,399
exploding and it's just so strange for

269
00:09:52,539 --> 00:09:57,279
me to see it because that's something I

270
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:58,899
can mark in a reality because it was my

271
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:01,120
reality so I was there as in New England

272
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:04,360
uh and I knew what it was like then and

273
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:08,980
now it's just as gobbled up as can be

274
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:10,810
and you're like whoa so Utah oh you just

275
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:12,759
oh yeah I got it sorry I think you were

276
00:10:10,809 --> 00:10:15,309
down there too we had a couple

277
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:18,250
volunteers from a Utah can that came by

278
00:10:15,309 --> 00:10:19,959
our booth down in San Jose and CIA these

279
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:21,309
guys were like we're from Utah we're

280
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:23,620
thinking about putting together a show

281
00:10:21,309 --> 00:10:25,179
I'm like I'm in I'm with you I really

282
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:27,759
thought someone asked me to force prank

283
00:10:25,179 --> 00:10:29,679
the 50 states honestly I thought you

284
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:31,179
talkin in Texas with you last no Texas

285
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:32,649
even I was a CVD program a lot of people

286
00:10:31,179 --> 00:10:33,879
don't know there's a few dispensaries

287
00:10:32,649 --> 00:10:35,860
nobody knows about they keep it under

288
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:38,169
wraps it's very much a red state but

289
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:39,590
Utah I was so impressed they know they

290
00:10:38,169 --> 00:10:41,629
went for it yeah

291
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:44,180
and it just shows an incredible

292
00:10:41,629 --> 00:10:46,789
awareness to the homeopathic medicinal

293
00:10:44,179 --> 00:10:49,879
properties that cannabis can and can be

294
00:10:46,789 --> 00:10:51,679
derived from provide - and and so all of

295
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:54,049
a sudden you have this radical paradigm

296
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:56,838
shift of the value of the product not

297
00:10:54,049 --> 00:10:59,000
just financially but actually as a

298
00:10:56,839 --> 00:11:00,770
product and now they're saying hey we

299
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,710
can we can work with opiate addiction

300
00:11:00,769 --> 00:11:06,049
and we can work with the seizures you

301
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:08,710
have the new EPA approved or the FDA

302
00:11:06,049 --> 00:11:11,149
approved of dialects so it may be

303
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:13,370
$37,000 for a year's treatment but the

304
00:11:11,149 --> 00:11:15,889
point is that it has been accepted at a

305
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:18,528
level that nothing else has and it

306
00:11:15,889 --> 00:11:19,909
begins the the belief in the acceptance

307
00:11:18,528 --> 00:11:22,129
so that you can start to really figure

308
00:11:19,909 --> 00:11:25,278
out how to use this varietal or the

309
00:11:22,129 --> 00:11:26,539
others this family of varietals and and

310
00:11:25,278 --> 00:11:29,299
people finally get some benefit they

311
00:11:26,539 --> 00:11:31,278
need and this stigma is not on them they

312
00:11:29,299 --> 00:11:32,990
don't have to be ashamed their children

313
00:11:31,278 --> 00:11:34,610
find relief from products have to go

314
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:37,250
illegally get in other states and they

315
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:39,830
risk like it's crazy

316
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:41,690
yeah I'm diggin it man for any beat and

317
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:43,040
I'm taking in business over the last

318
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:44,150
couple years where we always felt like

319
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:45,349
we're getting pounded out making the

320
00:11:44,149 --> 00:11:46,579
transition suffer

321
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:47,899
where every time you you were shifting

322
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:49,820
you were like well no and then the cost

323
00:11:47,899 --> 00:11:52,279
of building your own world was really

324
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:53,510
really high and and people say that's

325
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:55,129
you know in naivete that we didn't

326
00:11:53,509 --> 00:11:57,409
understand it but it's that nobody

327
00:11:55,129 --> 00:11:59,059
understood it because the regulations

328
00:11:57,409 --> 00:12:01,639
change so frequently that you having to

329
00:11:59,059 --> 00:12:03,829
modify modify modify it was just an

330
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:05,210
incredibly expensive process terrifying

331
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:06,740
so for anybody that got involved in

332
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:08,450
cannabis they bled money so we all have

333
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:10,399
the same thing the investors coming in

334
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:12,650
I'm believing growers I'm bleeding

335
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,879
that's what it is when you build it's a

336
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:15,529
real world yes I don't think people

337
00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:17,509
understand how it's off things abandon

338
00:12:15,529 --> 00:12:19,909
it's all business as usual in the

339
00:12:17,509 --> 00:12:24,019
Triangle but it's not I'll take the

340
00:12:19,909 --> 00:12:25,639
beaten for the benefits of the general

341
00:12:24,019 --> 00:12:28,789
population where if the general

342
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:31,370
population can use cannabis to alleviate

343
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:32,909
issues that they really could benefit

344
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:34,500
from

345
00:12:32,909 --> 00:12:37,559
and it allows them to have a better

346
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:39,450
quality of life then what do you what do

347
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:43,619
you really put a value on that and so

348
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:45,150
the thing is that for us in cannabis we

349
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:47,610
just have to accept that there was a

350
00:12:45,149 --> 00:12:49,259
there was a huge trade that we traded a

351
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:52,080
lot of our personal freedoms for a

352
00:12:49,259 --> 00:12:53,250
greater good and and they say large

353
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:55,050
companies have taken the money but

354
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:57,509
regular people of benefiting in a way

355
00:12:55,049 --> 00:13:00,689
they couldn't prior because access

356
00:12:57,509 --> 00:13:01,950
wasn't allowed and it was like well just

357
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:03,480
move to California it's not that simple

358
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:08,040
man you can't just pick up and move what

359
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:09,750
you for ya can't do it it's just not

360
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:10,559
possible you feel transient and then

361
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:13,980
it's just a nightmare

362
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:16,289
and so finally you get individuals that

363
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:18,840
have the ability to easily access stuff

364
00:13:16,289 --> 00:13:21,629
readily available tested no more no more

365
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:26,360
predatory crowd oh yes

366
00:13:21,629 --> 00:13:28,419
