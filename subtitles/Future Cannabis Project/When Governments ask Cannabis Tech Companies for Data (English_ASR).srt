1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,359
all right we're just talking about being

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:05,759
arrested and being put on a DEA list so

3
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:07,470
there's that so quit are we on a deal I

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:10,190
don't I that's the question I mean this

5
00:00:07,469 --> 00:00:12,330
came up the other day right I

6
00:00:10,189 --> 00:00:14,428
strangely feel kind of good about that

7
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:17,910
it means that I'm doing something enough

8
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:19,439
to be recognized in this space and the

9
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:21,570
question becomes this like what happens

10
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:23,550
when say it does become federally

11
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:25,050
illegal does that de glaze like kiddy

12
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:26,519
rates right yeah I don't know right

13
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:28,170
probably all of a sudden the government

14
00:00:26,518 --> 00:00:29,909
starts looking at that list to see who

15
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:31,289
to tax right that's what that list

16
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:33,030
becomes as far as making sure I actually

17
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:35,609
had someone the other day this is really

18
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:37,380
interesting someone come to me the other

19
00:00:35,609 --> 00:00:39,000
day with a request to work with us to

20
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,679
get license to like we want access to

21
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,149
all of your dispensaries okay and there

22
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:44,128
were a CPA firm I was like okay well

23
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:45,628
talk to me why why are you interested in

24
00:00:44,128 --> 00:00:47,280
that they said well the city is really

25
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:49,699
interested in finding out who's not

26
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,379
paying their fair share of taxes so

27
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:54,329
they're leveraging your platform to

28
00:00:52,378 --> 00:00:56,968
figure out how much how many sales are

29
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:57,600
doing that cross-reference that's what I

30
00:00:56,969 --> 00:00:58,948
do

31
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,870
that's shady and I was like I can't do

32
00:00:58,948 --> 00:01:02,488
that I can't in good conscience I like

33
00:01:00,869 --> 00:01:05,039
you want me to narc out on my my

34
00:01:02,488 --> 00:01:06,239
customers like that's yeah that's good

35
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,229
look really good right right that's a

36
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:09,959
good way to make sure you're not going

37
00:01:07,228 --> 00:01:12,989
to get sales but otherwise I was like

38
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:14,158
honestly that's just real shady like you

39
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:15,750
don't want to do that to come now I mean

40
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,070
if anything would be that guy what do we

41
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:18,150
what are we paying our government for

42
00:01:17,069 --> 00:01:20,339
like if they can't figure that out

43
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:22,259
themselves right if they don't have the

44
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:24,270
tech to do it effectively yeah exactly

45
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:26,640
it's it's also potentially an

46
00:01:24,269 --> 00:01:29,340
opportunity right true but I think

47
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,159
that's a that's but isn't that like

48
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:33,390
isn't that what metrics should be doing

49
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:35,640
Yeah right shouldn't they be going to

50
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:36,900
the companies like metric to say hey we

51
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,420
need records on all these dispensaries

52
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:40,978
right who's paying who's not paying like

53
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:42,868
from a data perspective I could see the

54
00:01:40,978 --> 00:01:44,789
government connecting with the data and

55
00:01:42,868 --> 00:01:47,519
even like partially funding a data

56
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:49,409
company yeah to be able to get access to

57
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:51,030
all that connects I mean Washington did

58
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:52,200
it necessarily partner with the data

59
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:53,849
company but everything has to be

60
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,859
recorded through the state so have some

61
00:01:53,849 --> 00:01:58,048
sort of a platform in which everything

62
00:01:55,859 --> 00:01:59,399
gets recorded yeah that's public in yeah

63
00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:00,659
I mean and you really want it you want

64
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:01,590
to get it at that bottleneck that's

65
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:03,990
where you want to get the data from

66
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:06,090
cause otherwise I mean you know as well

67
00:02:03,989 --> 00:02:07,649
as I do how how segmented this

68
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:10,348
marketplace is right you're gonna have

69
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:11,520
to work with a big handful of companies

70
00:02:10,348 --> 00:02:13,799
to try to piece it together

71
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:17,580
do you remember what la did before

72
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:20,310
before California went wreck you know so

73
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:23,010
la posted a list of every single

74
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:23,939
dispensary illegal or no that's right I

75
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:26,219
do remember that and they're like

76
00:02:23,939 --> 00:02:28,469
basically saying like we know who you

77
00:02:26,219 --> 00:02:30,180
are we know you are we just laptop yeah

78
00:02:28,469 --> 00:02:32,009
and everyone got real scared

79
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:33,599
yes about what was gonna happen and then

80
00:02:32,009 --> 00:02:34,949
the worst thing that possibly could have

81
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,389
happened happened which is that nothing

82
00:02:34,949 --> 00:02:39,509
happened nothing happened right and it's

83
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:42,959
like all right so now either the

84
00:02:39,509 --> 00:02:44,729
government is like underfunded or it's

85
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:46,980
understaffed or they're understaffed and

86
00:02:44,729 --> 00:02:48,119
under under attack yeah under that

87
00:02:46,979 --> 00:02:51,299
definitely I think we all know that

88
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:52,860
they're under attack and so the question

89
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,270
becomes when are you gonna start seeing

90
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:56,070
that I think recently they actually did

91
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:58,800
didn't it I started doing some rates in

92
00:02:56,069 --> 00:03:02,419
the last month or so I think they kind

93
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,420
of had to yeah big

94
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:12,040
