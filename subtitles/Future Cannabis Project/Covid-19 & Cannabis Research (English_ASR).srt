1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,429
thank you for joining us today we are

2
00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:10,259
joined by two University of Lethbridge

3
00:00:07,429 --> 00:00:13,830
researchers who have been researching

4
00:00:10,259 --> 00:00:17,070
koba 19 and cannabis husband-and-wife

5
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:19,769
team the dynamic duo igor and olga

6
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:23,089
Kovalchuk can you give some background

7
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:26,250
on kind of what we know about what

8
00:00:23,089 --> 00:00:29,899
coronavirus attacks in the body and then

9
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:33,869
kind of your thought process in terms of

10
00:00:29,899 --> 00:00:37,109
solutions to either mitigate or

11
00:00:33,869 --> 00:00:46,170
eliminate coronaviruses ability to do

12
00:00:37,109 --> 00:00:48,109
what it does give you a presentation so

13
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:51,870
thank you very much for organizing this

14
00:00:48,109 --> 00:00:54,750
very interesting webinar so when

15
00:00:51,869 --> 00:00:56,939
coronavirus hit we of course all we're

16
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:59,850
kind of completely dumbfounded by it it

17
00:00:56,939 --> 00:01:02,009
just came out of nowhere and essentially

18
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:04,129
mixed up all the cards but then

19
00:01:02,009 --> 00:01:06,569
everybody in the world including us

20
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:08,490
started looking into what do we know

21
00:01:06,569 --> 00:01:12,658
about it what can we learn about it and

22
00:01:08,489 --> 00:01:14,789
is there anything we can do so from this

23
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:17,430
standpoint because we were previously

24
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:19,409
working on medical cannabis so we

25
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:21,720
thought okay is there room for medical

26
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:24,299
cannabis there in our fight against

27
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:26,368
comet so and what i'm going to talk

28
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:29,159
today about is a bit what we did in

29
00:01:26,368 --> 00:01:32,129
terms of bringing medical cannabis from

30
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:34,880
mechanisms to evidence-based medicine so

31
00:01:32,129 --> 00:01:39,719
yes we all have seen those pictures and

32
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:43,078
these are essentially our enemies and in

33
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:45,090
terms of what comedy 19 years so kobe 19

34
00:01:43,078 --> 00:01:49,139
is a disease that's caused by Tsarskoe

35
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:51,240
v2 virus which is highly homologous to

36
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:55,319
the original star to the first stars

37
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:59,280
virus and similarly to the SARS virus or

38
00:01:55,319 --> 00:02:01,139
HIV to interacts with ace to receptor in

39
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:05,460
jayjay and geo tensed converting enzyme

40
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:08,669
receptor as I'm to receptor and it uses

41
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:11,439
it essentially as a gateway into the

42
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:15,250
tissues and the tissues that

43
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:18,039
press ace - our oral tissues needs a

44
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:20,469
perennial tissues long epithelial

45
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:23,409
tissues are available health issues

46
00:02:20,469 --> 00:02:25,240
overall intestinal epithelial is also

47
00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:28,689
expressed in kidneys is expressed in

48
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:31,420
testes and those tissues specifically

49
00:02:28,689 --> 00:02:33,879
the airway issues as well as the

50
00:02:31,419 --> 00:02:36,459
intestinal tissues are considered

51
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:39,009
gateways of the virus because

52
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:41,830
essentially how does virus gets in

53
00:02:39,009 --> 00:02:43,929
either through airborne transmission

54
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:46,900
whereby the breeze in some of the

55
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:49,120
particles that contain some of the you

56
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:53,170
know the viral particles but essentially

57
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:55,569
it can be a little you know droplets

58
00:02:53,169 --> 00:02:58,869
that contain virus so they go and land

59
00:02:55,569 --> 00:03:00,819
on our tissues and alternatively we can

60
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:02,650
ingest something that's contaminated so

61
00:03:00,819 --> 00:03:05,709
it can get through also intestinal

62
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:08,349
tissue and so and such what the virus

63
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:12,520
does it interacts with a stew receptor

64
00:03:08,349 --> 00:03:14,590
and then it is brought in and if any of

65
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:17,980
these eco that forms it is brought into

66
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:21,099
the cell whereby it is uncoated of

67
00:03:17,979 --> 00:03:24,519
course and this is the RNA plus virus so

68
00:03:21,099 --> 00:03:26,530
we'll have then essentially its RNA

69
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:28,930
being further used to produce more of

70
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:31,060
its genetic material as well as to

71
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:33,640
produce more of coat protein and more

72
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:36,159
code and then essentially the classical

73
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:40,719
lifecycle of the virus whereby later

74
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:45,090
more viruses met and are essentially

75
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:48,969
being attacked further so of course our

76
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:50,979
so this is from the very recent paper is

77
00:03:48,969 --> 00:03:53,229
a very interesting article in nature

78
00:03:50,979 --> 00:03:57,939
talking about the role of a story

79
00:03:53,229 --> 00:03:59,738
scepter in Tsarskoe v2 and essentially

80
00:03:57,939 --> 00:04:06,069
the potential and the hypothesis of the

81
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:08,650
role of s2 overall and coverage 19 but

82
00:04:06,069 --> 00:04:12,310
it's the unimportant feature about code

83
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:15,849
19 disease is specifically the fact that

84
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:18,160
number one it is a very very disease of

85
00:04:15,849 --> 00:04:20,228
a spectrum many people have very very

86
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,310
light form of disease many people are

87
00:04:20,228 --> 00:04:24,129
asymptomatic

88
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:26,439
there is some people develop moderate

89
00:04:24,129 --> 00:04:29,350
coverage they would develop some for

90
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:35,259
example fever cough fatigue myalgia and

91
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:38,050
in many cases it goes into pneumonia and

92
00:04:35,259 --> 00:04:41,079
pneumonia of course in terms of severity

93
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:43,270
can lead to essentially acute

94
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:46,329
respiratory distress syndrome and

95
00:04:43,269 --> 00:04:48,879
respiratory failure and death whereby we

96
00:04:46,329 --> 00:04:53,829
have up to according to different

97
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:55,540
estimates up to you know twenty twenty

98
00:04:53,829 --> 00:04:57,849
percent people of people can have a

99
00:04:55,540 --> 00:05:00,550
kanay no more severe or moderate to

100
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:03,100
severe cough it and many of them will

101
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:05,350
require IV ly because of acute

102
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:08,379
respiratory distress syndrome the

103
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:11,919
mechanisms of a RDS are another very

104
00:05:08,379 --> 00:05:14,620
interesting aspect of the disease air

105
00:05:11,918 --> 00:05:17,379
Diaz is not a new phenomenon era Diaz

106
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:19,840
has been described to occurring Sarris

107
00:05:17,379 --> 00:05:21,790
it occurs in there's it actually is

108
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:25,659
really well known in very severe

109
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:28,000
influenza cases and the key to it is

110
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:31,350
what the phenomenon will recall this

111
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:34,149
cytokine storm so whereby we have a very

112
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:40,229
significant of a production of al six

113
00:05:34,149 --> 00:05:45,099
TNF alpha L 1 beta the whole array of

114
00:05:40,228 --> 00:05:50,050
CCL and essentially the over stimulation

115
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:54,789
of pro-inflammatory cytokines we also

116
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:56,500
have a regulation of other types of you

117
00:05:54,788 --> 00:05:59,379
know inflammation marker see reactive

118
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:02,978
protein is up and essentially

119
00:05:59,379 --> 00:06:06,550
interleukin-10 so on and we have down

120
00:06:02,978 --> 00:06:08,529
regulation of the very important

121
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:11,168
molecules that we do need to fight

122
00:06:08,529 --> 00:06:13,239
essentially to find the virus itself so

123
00:06:11,168 --> 00:06:16,299
it's a disbalance storms balanced

124
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:19,090
towards heavy pro-inflammatory and so

125
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:22,569
when this was reported many groups

126
00:06:19,089 --> 00:06:25,719
including our own what we what we

127
00:06:22,569 --> 00:06:28,329
noticed that again interleukin 6 and TNF

128
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:31,630
alpha the key cunning or perpetrators

129
00:06:28,329 --> 00:06:34,718
there so tussle is a mob now is being

130
00:06:31,629 --> 00:06:37,360
trialed as a potential

131
00:06:34,718 --> 00:06:39,548
to treat cytokine storm in Cavite 19 and

132
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:43,329
trustless mob is monoclonal antibody

133
00:06:39,548 --> 00:06:45,158
blocking interleukin 6 receptor so to

134
00:06:43,329 --> 00:06:47,739
that effect cultists and went into

135
00:06:45,158 --> 00:06:51,519
clinical trials and with a potential

136
00:06:47,738 --> 00:06:53,408
also to inhibit cytokine storm and Len

137
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:56,769
said in the beginning of May came up

138
00:06:53,408 --> 00:07:00,069
with a very interesting correspondent

139
00:06:56,769 --> 00:07:03,728
slash tutorial talking about calling for

140
00:07:00,069 --> 00:07:07,348
new anti TNF modalities that I needed to

141
00:07:03,728 --> 00:07:10,209
be trialed against this cytokine storm

142
00:07:07,348 --> 00:07:12,428
so to that effect what we have been

143
00:07:10,209 --> 00:07:14,709
doing before and again we haven't been

144
00:07:12,428 --> 00:07:16,748
working on comment because college

145
00:07:14,709 --> 00:07:20,709
wasn't around so we have been working

146
00:07:16,749 --> 00:07:23,860
actually on analyzing the medicinal

147
00:07:20,709 --> 00:07:26,050
properties of cannabis strains so

148
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:29,110
together is eager his lab has developed

149
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:31,209
about 1,500 different new varieties

150
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:33,429
different new hybrids marijuana

151
00:07:31,209 --> 00:07:37,059
marijuana hybrids marijuana hemp hybrids

152
00:07:33,428 --> 00:07:40,078
and what we started doing is profiling

153
00:07:37,059 --> 00:07:44,289
their extracts for their potential

154
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:46,929
biological activity and the questions we

155
00:07:44,288 --> 00:07:49,178
had horse the big part of it of this

156
00:07:46,928 --> 00:07:51,698
story we were looking into potential

157
00:07:49,178 --> 00:07:53,618
anti-cancer effects but we also were

158
00:07:51,699 --> 00:07:56,468
looking at a lot of anti-inflammatory

159
00:07:53,619 --> 00:07:58,029
effects we had interest in for example

160
00:07:56,468 --> 00:08:00,218
whether or not some of the effects can

161
00:07:58,028 --> 00:08:02,468
curb inflammation in oral tissues

162
00:08:00,218 --> 00:08:04,569
something a long period on ttle disease

163
00:08:02,468 --> 00:08:07,988
which is really very important

164
00:08:04,569 --> 00:08:10,088
we were also focusing on effects on

165
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:12,938
intestinal tissues again right because

166
00:08:10,088 --> 00:08:14,618
there is historical evidence from you

167
00:08:12,939 --> 00:08:17,709
know essentially from cases where people

168
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:20,110
would suggest that it is important in

169
00:08:17,709 --> 00:08:23,738
inflammatory bowel disease so

170
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:26,499
essentially we had been working with

171
00:08:23,738 --> 00:08:28,868
tissues that as appears our gateway

172
00:08:26,499 --> 00:08:31,509
tissues for the virus itself oral

173
00:08:28,869 --> 00:08:33,278
tissues airway and intestinal and we

174
00:08:31,509 --> 00:08:35,649
have been inducing inflammation and them

175
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:37,870
treating with extracts looking at the

176
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:40,568
effects as well as using batteries of

177
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:42,908
cell lines so when Koba did we thought

178
00:08:40,568 --> 00:08:45,669
okay first and foremost let's take a

179
00:08:42,908 --> 00:08:47,429
look whether or not application of our

180
00:08:45,669 --> 00:08:50,159
extracts affected

181
00:08:47,429 --> 00:08:52,319
ace to receptor itself on the level of

182
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:55,469
gene expression because the way we do

183
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:57,690
profiling after treatment we do and yes

184
00:08:55,470 --> 00:09:00,028
and we do the whole transcriptome

185
00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:02,490
profile in ways pathway analysis to see

186
00:09:00,028 --> 00:09:07,820
what pathways are affected to understand

187
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:11,220
the mechanisms of action and this is the

188
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:13,500
effects on the at the oral tissues so we

189
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:18,450
have profile to several extracts as you

190
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:20,700
can see for and then T 37.9 so it is 13

191
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:22,980
expert extras they were profiled in two

192
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:25,200
different experiments and we have noted

193
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:29,190
that on the level of gene expression

194
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:31,649
level of transcription to extracts thank

195
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:35,550
you 1:30 we're actually showing a pretty

196
00:09:31,649 --> 00:09:37,708
good inhibition and the West several

197
00:09:35,549 --> 00:09:39,778
that we're showing the pretty salted

198
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:43,349
trans in the a P oral tissue in the

199
00:09:39,778 --> 00:09:48,299
second experiment we then went further

200
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:49,950
and Godby a stew antibody and try to see

201
00:09:48,299 --> 00:09:51,569
what is happening on the level of the

202
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:54,390
protein because of course that is the

203
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:57,959
really very very important and we saw

204
00:09:54,389 --> 00:10:00,419
that several extras actually did down

205
00:09:57,958 --> 00:10:04,609
regulate a stew expression on the

206
00:10:00,419 --> 00:10:08,309
protein level which was quite promising

207
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:11,459
looking at the lung tissue and the at

208
00:10:08,309 --> 00:10:15,689
the epic airway tissue we noticed that

209
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:17,849
three extracts down regulated expression

210
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:19,800
of a stew and there is some trends

211
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:23,100
observed with the other two extras like

212
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:24,990
49 and 114 whereas there way extras

213
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:28,110
actually we're doing quite the opposite

214
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:29,610
which was quite interesting to us we

215
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:32,639
have been since then repeatedly

216
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:35,519
experiments using other models and

217
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:38,129
actually we have seen pretty much the

218
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:40,289
same reproducible picture which is again

219
00:10:38,129 --> 00:10:43,019
quite interesting not every extra

220
00:10:40,289 --> 00:10:45,269
behaves the same but what is really

221
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:47,549
interesting it's it's shown in the

222
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:49,588
preparan that we have unfortunately I

223
00:10:47,549 --> 00:10:53,159
don't have it in this presentation if

224
00:10:49,589 --> 00:10:54,839
you were to compare the CBD THC reshares

225
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:57,569
all these extras they are relatively

226
00:10:54,839 --> 00:11:00,520
comparable they're all high CBD lines

227
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:04,300
and there are some lines that have

228
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:07,569
for example a 1 to 21 so THC to CBD

229
00:11:04,299 --> 00:11:11,169
every and one line is active and the

230
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:13,300
other one is not which is again pointing

231
00:11:11,169 --> 00:11:15,669
to the fact that CBD is not just the

232
00:11:13,299 --> 00:11:19,990
answer there is more to cannabis than

233
00:11:15,669 --> 00:11:22,120
just CBD and intestinal tissue is on the

234
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:26,110
level of transcription we have seen one

235
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:29,440
extract too spectacular it was extra 45

236
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:31,930
and when we further extended that to the

237
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:34,480
protein level we noticed that yes extra

238
00:11:31,929 --> 00:11:37,059
45 still did the best and there were

239
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:42,720
some other extras that did show the

240
00:11:37,059 --> 00:11:45,309
activity extracts 1 7 129 and 169

241
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:48,220
another interesting aspect we notice

242
00:11:45,309 --> 00:11:50,859
that some extracts may be active on one

243
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:53,040
tissue and inactive on the other one and

244
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:56,110
right now we are trying to actually

245
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:58,929
pretty much do the array and compare

246
00:11:56,110 --> 00:12:01,930
against the same kano same extra against

247
00:11:58,929 --> 00:12:05,049
the different types of tissues to

248
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:07,958
identify ones that are gay no harm

249
00:12:05,049 --> 00:12:10,629
targeting multiple aspects why because

250
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:13,269
again cannabis is non-generic cannabis

251
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:15,759
does have as specifically extras do have

252
00:12:13,269 --> 00:12:17,708
certain tissue specificity which if you

253
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:19,769
think about logical terms make sense

254
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:23,919
right it makes a lot of sense

255
00:12:19,769 --> 00:12:25,809
so the we're also write some interesting

256
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:28,629
findings that we've seen on the level

257
00:12:25,809 --> 00:12:30,909
again over transcript on TM p RS s 2

258
00:12:28,629 --> 00:12:33,189
which is a serine protease that was

259
00:12:30,909 --> 00:12:36,100
reported by the group in germany to be

260
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:39,040
important in again interaction with the

261
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:41,350
spike protein and it's important

262
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:44,708
protease it's involved in cleavage so

263
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:47,589
again they are pretty good indicators on

264
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:50,469
of the effects are in oral tissue and

265
00:12:47,589 --> 00:12:53,560
intestinal tissue on the level of auntie

266
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:56,230
mo TM p RS s we are we asked to look in

267
00:12:53,559 --> 00:12:57,669
in the lung tissue again because a lot

268
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:59,980
of it has been done before but

269
00:12:57,669 --> 00:13:01,929
additional work we're doing in a partial

270
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:05,649
walk down situation pretty much probably

271
00:13:01,929 --> 00:13:08,199
as everybody else right now and then of

272
00:13:05,649 --> 00:13:11,409
course the story of the cytokine storm

273
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:12,910
comes we have as I mentioned we have

274
00:13:11,409 --> 00:13:15,219
been doing some work on

275
00:13:12,909 --> 00:13:18,100
anti-inflammatory potencies of extracts

276
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:19,930
so we'll take the extracts in applied

277
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:22,389
into tissues where we would induce

278
00:13:19,929 --> 00:13:25,359
inflammation in this case we used human

279
00:13:22,389 --> 00:13:29,110
3d full-thickness epiderm tissue and

280
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:30,970
induced inflammation with using UV so

281
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:35,529
it's very strong induction of

282
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:38,050
inflammation as evidenced by TNF and by

283
00:13:35,529 --> 00:13:40,539
induction of other inflammatory markers

284
00:13:38,049 --> 00:13:43,269
and then we will treat the extracts

285
00:13:40,539 --> 00:13:46,059
treat the tissues with the angstroms and

286
00:13:43,269 --> 00:13:48,279
again harvest the tissues do the global

287
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:51,309
transcript on profile and take a look at

288
00:13:48,279 --> 00:13:53,169
what's happening and so we have

289
00:13:51,309 --> 00:13:56,079
pre-selected that the extracts with

290
00:13:53,169 --> 00:13:59,439
which we went forward and further on

291
00:13:56,080 --> 00:14:02,410
zoomed into seven in the context of this

292
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:05,350
article and these out of these seven

293
00:14:02,409 --> 00:14:08,409
what was really quite impressive that

294
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:10,779
extract number four eight and fourteen

295
00:14:08,409 --> 00:14:13,719
we're actually the most effective in

296
00:14:10,779 --> 00:14:17,110
terms of the downregulated TNF and

297
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:19,570
interleukin 6 very profoundly and they

298
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:21,810
also down regulated a whole bunch of

299
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:26,160
other inflammatory cytokines like

300
00:14:21,809 --> 00:14:28,329
interleukin-1 beta interleukin 23

301
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:31,360
interleukin 17 C which are really

302
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:33,100
important then of course the CCL 2 again

303
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:36,279
one very very important for inflammatory

304
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:39,940
cytokine NF kappa-b was down regulated

305
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:43,389
tlr-2 was down regulated so this again

306
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:46,450
was a very very strong response in terms

307
00:14:43,389 --> 00:14:48,519
of concerted down regulation of

308
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:51,940
inflammation markers if you look at

309
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:56,169
extra number six for example yes it did

310
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:59,310
on regulate TNF as well as interleukin 6

311
00:14:56,169 --> 00:15:02,259
but it didn't really affect the others

312
00:14:59,309 --> 00:15:05,229
chemokines and cytokines and if a cup of

313
00:15:02,259 --> 00:15:08,649
beer TLR and actually CXC l12

314
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:11,350
was up regulated if you look at for

315
00:15:08,649 --> 00:15:14,769
example extra 13 it didn't affect

316
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:17,620
interleukin 6 we only affected TNF and

317
00:15:14,769 --> 00:15:22,000
again it's actually even up regulated

318
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:25,090
some of 6cl molecules and extract number

319
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,269
12 quite interestingly up regulated

320
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:28,970
interleukin 6

321
00:15:26,269 --> 00:15:30,709
mr. number 15 did nothing so essentially

322
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:32,420
there were no significant changes at all

323
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:36,289
whatsoever on the level of the entire

324
00:15:32,419 --> 00:15:39,438
transcriptome so we were quite puzzled

325
00:15:36,289 --> 00:15:41,688
by this but again what this signifies is

326
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:44,539
again cannabis is not generic it's very

327
00:15:41,688 --> 00:15:46,990
very important to identify the right

328
00:15:44,539 --> 00:15:49,909
strains it will do of course will be a

329
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:51,649
truly uphill battle but will be quite a

330
00:15:49,909 --> 00:15:55,759
lot of work to be done if we were

331
00:15:51,649 --> 00:15:58,249
wanting to identify the key molecules

332
00:15:55,759 --> 00:16:00,188
behind the effects because as you know

333
00:15:58,249 --> 00:16:03,079
there are so many there's so many

334
00:16:00,188 --> 00:16:05,178
cytochrome springing cannabinoids

335
00:16:03,078 --> 00:16:07,489
there's so many terpenes and of course

336
00:16:05,178 --> 00:16:10,938
the entourage effect is there but this

337
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:13,100
is already a very important piece of

338
00:16:10,938 --> 00:16:17,240
work because again we have three that

339
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:20,329
are really good in in this Kenya in this

340
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:23,360
model and they can be developed further

341
00:16:20,328 --> 00:16:25,849
actually originally we were hoping it's

342
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:28,188
you work with them to develop them as

343
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:30,649
within a clinical trial against

344
00:16:28,188 --> 00:16:33,528
rheumatoid arthritis but knowing that

345
00:16:30,649 --> 00:16:36,019
rheumatoid arthritis and cytokine storm

346
00:16:33,528 --> 00:16:38,568
essentially share the the mechanism

347
00:16:36,019 --> 00:16:40,818
right interleukin 6 and T and F are the

348
00:16:38,568 --> 00:16:43,039
mechanism behind it this actually they

349
00:16:40,818 --> 00:16:46,548
can be you know developed along both

350
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:49,099
lots so when we looked at the level of

351
00:16:46,548 --> 00:16:52,610
protein as you can see it was pretty

352
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:54,589
strong induction of inflammation I seen

353
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:56,839
here by Cox doing a little interleukin 6

354
00:16:54,589 --> 00:16:59,410
and you can see that the extra stayed

355
00:16:56,839 --> 00:17:01,579
down regulate interleukin 6 and cox-2 I

356
00:16:59,409 --> 00:17:03,889
external 15 if anything kind of up

357
00:17:01,578 --> 00:17:07,308
regulated it so the where differences

358
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:09,318
again between the extracts but we can

359
00:17:07,308 --> 00:17:11,088
say that some of the very you know

360
00:17:09,318 --> 00:17:14,928
extras that we found to be very

361
00:17:11,088 --> 00:17:20,119
interesting and potent actually can be

362
00:17:14,929 --> 00:17:22,189
looked into it just a little some skinny

363
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:25,879
snapshot of some of the pathway analysis

364
00:17:22,189 --> 00:17:28,130
we did so this is the facts of extra

365
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:30,169
number four on cytokine cytokine

366
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:32,840
receptor interaction pathway and you can

367
00:17:30,169 --> 00:17:34,700
see the cytokines the chemokines and

368
00:17:32,839 --> 00:17:37,129
green in this case denotes down

369
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:39,860
regulation so you can see the majority

370
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:42,500
of them break down regulated

371
00:17:39,859 --> 00:17:45,079
whereas if you look at extra 12 this is

372
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:48,319
the same pathway we see our pre-k Latian

373
00:17:45,079 --> 00:17:50,928
so it is really very very important to

374
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:54,019
start properly looking and selecting the

375
00:17:50,929 --> 00:17:57,830
strings and we can do that just based on

376
00:17:54,019 --> 00:17:59,990
CBD to teach Eurasia because ratios are

377
00:17:57,829 --> 00:18:02,089
comparable you hit the wrong strain and

378
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:04,250
you have an essentially an undesirable

379
00:18:02,089 --> 00:18:07,009
effect because you up regulate things

380
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:09,648
that you'd want it down regulate and on

381
00:18:07,009 --> 00:18:12,230
this slide this is a comparison of

382
00:18:09,648 --> 00:18:15,079
rheumatoid arthritis CAC pathway again

383
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:19,870
as affected by extra number four and

384
00:18:15,079 --> 00:18:22,099
extra number 12 so as you can see again

385
00:18:19,869 --> 00:18:24,408
significant and very concerted down

386
00:18:22,099 --> 00:18:27,558
regulation of the pathway by extract

387
00:18:24,409 --> 00:18:30,350
four and quite the opposite actually by

388
00:18:27,558 --> 00:18:34,278
extra twelve again speaking for the fact

389
00:18:30,349 --> 00:18:37,788
that cannabis is non-generic so to sum

390
00:18:34,278 --> 00:18:40,630
it up this is where we think cannabis

391
00:18:37,788 --> 00:18:43,278
versus call it by its kind of the lines

392
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:44,778
against kind of along which the cannabis

393
00:18:43,278 --> 00:18:47,509
we're just calling the fight can occur

394
00:18:44,778 --> 00:18:51,288
the first one opportunity is blocking

395
00:18:47,509 --> 00:18:54,038
the entry by interacting with ace to

396
00:18:51,288 --> 00:18:57,079
receptor as well as the MP RSS to and

397
00:18:54,038 --> 00:18:59,329
the second one is actually very

398
00:18:57,079 --> 00:19:02,178
promising again the potential to

399
00:18:59,329 --> 00:19:04,668
influence a cytokine storm because

400
00:19:02,179 --> 00:19:06,830
cytokine storm is a cause offers acute

401
00:19:04,669 --> 00:19:10,519
respiratory distress in Malta or organ

402
00:19:06,829 --> 00:19:12,829
failure and the potential to influence

403
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:15,740
the levels of these cytokines could lead

404
00:19:12,829 --> 00:19:19,638
to the potential a clinical trial

405
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:22,519
looking into for example you know people

406
00:19:19,638 --> 00:19:24,349
are dosed with the extra and we see how

407
00:19:22,519 --> 00:19:26,839
many of them do develop severe disease

408
00:19:24,349 --> 00:19:28,609
and hospital admissions at a whole

409
00:19:26,839 --> 00:19:30,648
decrease in the disease severity

410
00:19:28,609 --> 00:19:34,278
decrease in the hospital admissions

411
00:19:30,648 --> 00:19:36,408
shortening disease duration and that of

412
00:19:34,278 --> 00:19:38,028
course is sorry the slight slightly John

413
00:19:36,409 --> 00:19:42,110
this is what we have been doing before

414
00:19:38,028 --> 00:19:45,220
clotted focusing on cancer on brain as

415
00:19:42,109 --> 00:19:48,798
you know disease of CNS disease

416
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:51,589
neurological psychiatric skin as well as

417
00:19:48,798 --> 00:19:53,450
information trying through preclinical

418
00:19:51,589 --> 00:19:55,189
tests and identify this

419
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:58,639
strains that can then be used to

420
00:19:55,190 --> 00:20:00,798
formulate clinical trials focusing not

421
00:19:58,638 --> 00:20:03,949
just on safety toxicity tolerability

422
00:20:00,798 --> 00:20:06,470
but on quality of life and of course

423
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:08,569
there have been some works done along

424
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:10,839
the code of life improvement in cannabis

425
00:20:08,569 --> 00:20:14,148
meaning affected appetite sleep pain

426
00:20:10,839 --> 00:20:16,898
depression anxiety but also focusing on

427
00:20:14,148 --> 00:20:19,308
disease improvement so we had some

428
00:20:16,898 --> 00:20:21,500
alliance that had very significant

429
00:20:19,308 --> 00:20:23,690
anti-tumor effect and we were hoping to

430
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:26,720
see as a secondary outcome for example

431
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:30,470
one could look at the general tumor

432
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:32,298
burden and the the metastatic load or in

433
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:33,019
context for example of rheumatoid

434
00:20:32,298 --> 00:20:35,028
arthritis

435
00:20:33,019 --> 00:20:37,609
whether or not we could along with

436
00:20:35,028 --> 00:20:41,200
quality of life and pain also influence

437
00:20:37,609 --> 00:20:44,898
the disease scores and again focusing on

438
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:47,269
skin diseases skin aging skin cancer and

439
00:20:44,898 --> 00:20:50,719
in terms of brain Parkinson's dementia

440
00:20:47,269 --> 00:20:54,109
stroke ms and trauma so all of those are

441
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:56,750
really pretty much targets for future

442
00:20:54,109 --> 00:20:59,178
development in the cannabis industry and

443
00:20:56,750 --> 00:21:00,710
in the cannabis research and hoping you

444
00:20:59,179 --> 00:21:02,840
know inchoate is over we would have

445
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:05,569
learned something from it we would have

446
00:21:02,839 --> 00:21:08,329
probably developed kind you know more

447
00:21:05,569 --> 00:21:11,359
strategies of developing clinical trials

448
00:21:08,329 --> 00:21:14,148
and so on it can later be used for

449
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:16,278
combating other diseases and you know

450
00:21:14,148 --> 00:21:19,398
he's Adi the people on the teams with

451
00:21:16,278 --> 00:21:21,470
who we or quiz and I'll just go back

452
00:21:19,398 --> 00:21:24,199
space so that we can keep cannabis and

453
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:33,440
call it here as our place hold if we

454
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:35,929
wish to so I have a question and I'm not

455
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:38,538
an infectious disease person I'm a power

456
00:21:35,929 --> 00:21:40,278
I understand pathways mechanism of

457
00:21:38,538 --> 00:21:41,480
action things like that and I was

458
00:21:40,278 --> 00:21:43,669
wondering if you could if you couldn't

459
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:49,630
address and you know in a short sort of

460
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:53,179
layman's terms are you saying that the

461
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:58,760
cannabinoids are there interrupting the

462
00:21:53,179 --> 00:22:01,669
ability for AC AC to for the virus to

463
00:21:58,759 --> 00:22:04,788
bind and get into the cell and that's

464
00:22:01,669 --> 00:22:07,190
and disc and then go into the

465
00:22:04,788 --> 00:22:10,759
relationship and maybe I'm wrong so

466
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:12,890
they can correct me or is it or is it

467
00:22:10,759 --> 00:22:15,289
just is it the abilities are actually

468
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:18,140
just just reducing these cytokines and

469
00:22:15,289 --> 00:22:21,500
and impacting the cytokine storm so is

470
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:23,870
it sort of a visited is it affecting the

471
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:27,619
symptoms or it is affecting the the

472
00:22:23,869 --> 00:22:32,809
actual mechanism of the virus you know

473
00:22:27,619 --> 00:22:36,139
getting into the cells okay you there

474
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:39,649
are two aspects there first off we

475
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:42,530
haven't studied the virus itself we only

476
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:46,009
looked at the effects of cannabis on a

477
00:22:42,529 --> 00:22:47,990
stool receptor levels and our hypothesis

478
00:22:46,009 --> 00:22:50,990
is that if a store receptor levels

479
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:53,420
decrease this may lead to low

480
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:56,569
infectivity we actually have just

481
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:58,580
submitted a proposal to actually to test

482
00:22:56,569 --> 00:23:01,069
that hypothesis further but that was our

483
00:22:58,579 --> 00:23:03,079
fundamental preliminary data piece to

484
00:23:01,069 --> 00:23:05,450
say because you know if we were just to

485
00:23:03,079 --> 00:23:07,460
come up and say cannabinoids may if may

486
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:09,529
you know effect infective 'ti people

487
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:11,720
will say what a hack why why in the

488
00:23:09,529 --> 00:23:14,930
world are you thinking that but the fact

489
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:17,480
that it actually reduces the expression

490
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:20,390
of the receptor it may lead to that and

491
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:22,400
again that has to be tested and we are

492
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:25,700
hoping now with our colleagues who have

493
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:28,430
BCL us we you know cl3 because we need

494
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:32,990
to see all three for that so we need to

495
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:36,350
test that means there are fewer

496
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:39,170
receptors on the surface of the cell so

497
00:23:36,349 --> 00:23:41,509
for for any pathogen to infect you

498
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:43,789
efficiently there should be a rate of

499
00:23:41,509 --> 00:23:47,599
infection that should be certain number

500
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:49,519
of infected cells per minute right so if

501
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:51,289
there are many viral particles around

502
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:54,109
there there are only few receptors to

503
00:23:51,289 --> 00:23:56,329
bind to virus may not have enough time

504
00:23:54,109 --> 00:23:59,469
to interact and get into cells can be

505
00:23:56,329 --> 00:23:59,470
eliminated by the immune system

506
00:24:00,099 --> 00:24:05,089
so essentially you know kind of this

507
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:07,340
finding led to another hypothesis if we

508
00:24:05,089 --> 00:24:11,329
will now be testing whether or not we

509
00:24:07,339 --> 00:24:13,759
will actually affect the rate of

510
00:24:11,329 --> 00:24:15,649
infection itself in this read it in the

511
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:18,890
tissues or in cells for now and then

512
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:20,269
tissues the second one is yes the second

513
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:22,369
one is through the site of nervous

514
00:24:20,269 --> 00:24:26,229
storm that is you're absolutely correct

515
00:24:22,368 --> 00:24:30,468
it is by the anti-inflammatory mechanism

516
00:24:26,229 --> 00:24:33,019
how exactly is it mediated through CBL

517
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:35,690
cb2 receptor is very well could be we

518
00:24:33,019 --> 00:24:37,729
are looking into that now but we do see

519
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:40,070
on the level of pathway analysis that

520
00:24:37,729 --> 00:24:44,239
there is major down regulation of

521
00:24:40,069 --> 00:24:46,908
pro-inflammatory pathways and with

522
00:24:44,239 --> 00:24:48,288
regards to the the extracts I guess

523
00:24:46,909 --> 00:24:53,089
you're trying to figure out if there's

524
00:24:48,288 --> 00:24:57,769
there's a specific terpene or flavonoid

525
00:24:53,088 --> 00:24:59,569
profile or different cannabinoids it's

526
00:24:57,769 --> 00:25:02,778
and I guess you're looking into that to

527
00:24:59,569 --> 00:25:04,819
see separating out the ones where we're

528
00:25:02,778 --> 00:25:08,259
producing overexpression static lines

529
00:25:04,819 --> 00:25:08,259
versus down-regulation cytokines

530
00:25:08,618 --> 00:25:19,158
anything there I'm not intending to

531
00:25:13,118 --> 00:25:21,769
report but that's if I knew what you

532
00:25:19,159 --> 00:25:26,859
know so basically we have started with

533
00:25:21,769 --> 00:25:30,528
400 extracts we went down to 48 that

534
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:33,978
anti-inflammatory out of this 48 we

535
00:25:30,528 --> 00:25:36,348
discarded high THC once for one specific

536
00:25:33,979 --> 00:25:38,538
reason most of the doctors are not

537
00:25:36,348 --> 00:25:41,989
comfortable prescribing high THC and

538
00:25:38,538 --> 00:25:44,479
most of the patients would likely not

539
00:25:41,989 --> 00:25:48,499
benefit from being constantly high while

540
00:25:44,479 --> 00:25:51,499
taking the medicine so this implement it

541
00:25:48,499 --> 00:25:54,858
right so that means we focused about on

542
00:25:51,499 --> 00:25:58,190
24 let's say that we're high CBD or

543
00:25:54,858 --> 00:26:02,328
balanced one to one and out of this or a

544
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:06,739
certain that we do not understand here

545
00:26:02,328 --> 00:26:09,078
my ratios what is active what not so we

546
00:26:06,739 --> 00:26:11,929
would have to do some so-called

547
00:26:09,078 --> 00:26:13,668
fractionation where we do take fractions

548
00:26:11,929 --> 00:26:16,639
right and then see which one is the most

549
00:26:13,669 --> 00:26:20,149
active and so-called reconstitution when

550
00:26:16,638 --> 00:26:22,908
we add these ingredients back and see

551
00:26:20,148 --> 00:26:27,258
what is the minimum that is active and

552
00:26:22,909 --> 00:26:28,549
what is a maximum of is active where did

553
00:26:27,259 --> 00:26:31,940
what do you think in terms of your

554
00:26:28,548 --> 00:26:33,950
what's your what's your timeline like if

555
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:36,350
if in

556
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:40,788
it sounds like you're getting access to

557
00:26:36,349 --> 00:26:42,699
the to your bcl3 lab and you're going to

558
00:26:40,788 --> 00:26:45,528
start working with neurologists and

559
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:47,149
they're going to start start doing some

560
00:26:45,528 --> 00:26:49,398
work with you is that is that what

561
00:26:47,148 --> 00:26:51,319
sounds like the direction that's pretty

562
00:26:49,398 --> 00:26:53,209
much me we want a girl for the first and

563
00:26:51,319 --> 00:26:58,609
foremost by now waiting for the for the

564
00:26:53,210 --> 00:27:00,769
funding so we have let you know funding

565
00:26:58,609 --> 00:27:02,839
crisis everywhere in science right for

566
00:27:00,769 --> 00:27:05,048
so couple of opportunities that have

567
00:27:02,839 --> 00:27:09,138
been posted we try to respond to every

568
00:27:05,048 --> 00:27:12,048
opportunity literally soldier angel and

569
00:27:09,138 --> 00:27:13,879
as soon as we hear in fingers cross

570
00:27:12,048 --> 00:27:16,519
state we hope to hear within couple of

571
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:18,049
weeks so whether or not we do get the

572
00:27:16,519 --> 00:27:20,480
funding if we do get the funding that

573
00:27:18,048 --> 00:27:22,849
would be actually will form a we already

574
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:26,200
formed a big team it has several

575
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:28,369
institutions involved in colleges or

576
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:31,970
clinicians specialist in infectious

577
00:27:28,369 --> 00:27:33,859
diseases two independent bcl3 labs will

578
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:36,589
be conducting testing to make sure you

579
00:27:33,859 --> 00:27:39,259
know connect you to have this if all of

580
00:27:36,589 --> 00:27:41,480
his son because you know how the funding

581
00:27:39,259 --> 00:27:43,970
rates now if it's not working then we

582
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:46,278
will still try to you because again

583
00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:48,288
these collaborations are going so we'll

584
00:27:46,278 --> 00:27:51,200
try to see what is the you know the bare

585
00:27:48,288 --> 00:27:52,849
minimum we can do because there is you

586
00:27:51,200 --> 00:28:02,319
know their pockets are also not made out

587
00:27:52,849 --> 00:28:05,138
of robberies are moving forward we also

588
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:08,000
ready to go to clinical trials

589
00:28:05,138 --> 00:28:09,379
describing is to identify what are the

590
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,419
mechanisms what are the active

591
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:14,720
ingredients but as far as the patient

592
00:28:11,419 --> 00:28:18,740
concerns and concern we know that we

593
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:21,429
have active extracts right so and so we

594
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:24,169
want to do a clinical trial high CBD

595
00:28:21,429 --> 00:28:26,538
extracts should go through the safety

596
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:28,460
and toxicity no problem it would be

597
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:31,038
sufficient to demonstrate what's known

598
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:34,340
in the literature right so because it's

599
00:28:31,038 --> 00:28:37,519
been done many many times so ten mu just

600
00:28:34,339 --> 00:28:39,980
I can go to clinical trial phase two and

601
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:42,779
demonstrate the efficacy of the

602
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:45,848
formulation with patients

603
00:28:42,779 --> 00:28:45,848
[Music]

604
00:28:46,118 --> 00:28:54,968
very and you guys think it's the CBD

605
00:28:52,778 --> 00:28:57,489
that's the active ingredient here or is

606
00:28:54,969 --> 00:28:59,318
that I remember this great paper by the

607
00:28:57,489 --> 00:29:00,548
way sorry to interject halfway through

608
00:28:59,318 --> 00:29:02,469
you may have already addressed the

609
00:29:00,548 --> 00:29:04,358
question but I read the paper and it

610
00:29:02,469 --> 00:29:06,519
looked as if you had a lot of extracts

611
00:29:04,358 --> 00:29:08,948
that were behaving but what didn't seem

612
00:29:06,519 --> 00:29:11,409
to correlate with CBD or THC ratios so

613
00:29:08,949 --> 00:29:16,048
there's something else that's perhaps at

614
00:29:11,409 --> 00:29:19,209
play right so I just hypothesized that

615
00:29:16,048 --> 00:29:22,028
CBD may be one of the active ingredients

616
00:29:19,209 --> 00:29:24,729
but its activity definitely is modulated

617
00:29:22,028 --> 00:29:28,358
by something else this time some land

618
00:29:24,729 --> 00:29:31,298
else unlikely is THC because we have

619
00:29:28,358 --> 00:29:33,878
extras that have more or less same CBD

620
00:29:31,298 --> 00:29:37,388
to teach Siri sure and one of them worth

621
00:29:33,878 --> 00:29:40,688
one them does not right so it may be

622
00:29:37,388 --> 00:29:43,178
some minor cannabinoids it may be some

623
00:29:40,689 --> 00:29:46,869
turps and their combinations so it will

624
00:29:43,179 --> 00:29:48,849
if these signs properly it may take two

625
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:51,398
or three years until we know what actor

626
00:29:48,848 --> 00:29:54,278
ingredients combination is but again

627
00:29:51,398 --> 00:29:57,698
patients cannot wait and if there is an

628
00:29:54,278 --> 00:30:02,828
active botanical extract why not study

629
00:29:57,699 --> 00:30:05,259
its effect I'm sorry go ahead

630
00:30:02,828 --> 00:30:07,328
I said especially if it's high CBD and

631
00:30:05,259 --> 00:30:09,608
it's considered as generally regarded as

632
00:30:07,328 --> 00:30:11,229
safe we don't know yeah no that's a

633
00:30:09,608 --> 00:30:13,298
great path from a regulatory standpoint

634
00:30:11,229 --> 00:30:16,568
did you happen to see there was a paper

635
00:30:13,298 --> 00:30:18,519
out of out of Vietnam that screened 4200

636
00:30:16,568 --> 00:30:21,278
different compounds out of the plants in

637
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:23,858
Vietnam and one that came at the top of

638
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:27,898
their list as a Tsarskoe v2 main

639
00:30:23,858 --> 00:30:31,298
protease inhibitor was cannabis in a mmm

640
00:30:27,898 --> 00:30:34,418
which was wild I totally find a couple

641
00:30:31,298 --> 00:30:35,469
papers on cannabis in a I think I'm

642
00:30:34,419 --> 00:30:36,969
gonna probably be murder the

643
00:30:35,469 --> 00:30:39,129
pronunciation of this I think curse

644
00:30:36,969 --> 00:30:42,249
eaten is another one which is not

645
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:44,318
necessarily unique to cannabis but was

646
00:30:42,249 --> 00:30:47,558
found as another zinc ionophore which

647
00:30:44,318 --> 00:30:50,259
might behave like a hydroxy cork and but

648
00:30:47,558 --> 00:30:52,148
maybe not with the arrhythmia issues and

649
00:30:50,259 --> 00:30:53,558
I've been asking around and I don't know

650
00:30:52,148 --> 00:30:55,208
many people that are searching for these

651
00:30:53,558 --> 00:30:57,969
I think I think cannabis and a is like a

652
00:30:55,209 --> 00:30:58,519
molecular way to 594 so it falls off or

653
00:30:57,969 --> 00:31:00,950
somebody

654
00:30:58,519 --> 00:31:03,259
and people are doing but I think your

655
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:05,509
seaton is is a little might be a little

656
00:31:03,259 --> 00:31:07,069
easier to find I don't know much about

657
00:31:05,509 --> 00:31:08,809
where these you're expressed I think

658
00:31:07,069 --> 00:31:11,179
there is I think I think cannabis today

659
00:31:08,809 --> 00:31:12,799
is more in seeds maybe from what I've

660
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:15,590
read from some hemp papers at Richard

661
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:17,990
Rose sent me right and then I I really

662
00:31:15,589 --> 00:31:21,369
don't know much about the levels of

663
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:24,440
course eaten in cannabis I don't know

664
00:31:21,369 --> 00:31:26,899
yeah so basically botanical extracts are

665
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:30,049
very powerful the problem was in youonce

666
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:32,870
is is there's no established safety and

667
00:31:30,049 --> 00:31:35,539
toxicity through monograph literature it

668
00:31:32,869 --> 00:31:38,779
will take time in order to move to

669
00:31:35,539 --> 00:31:42,980
clinical trial but with ICD extract so

670
00:31:38,779 --> 00:31:46,279
if you claim that CBD and THC and maybe

671
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:48,650
some my main other major cannabinoids if

672
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:50,629
they active ingredient you can go ahead

673
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:53,600
to the clinical trial that's the way the

674
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:55,280
rules work well thank you guys for doing

675
00:31:53,599 --> 00:31:57,649
that so quickly I mean that it's just

676
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:59,839
amazing that after you know a few months

677
00:31:57,650 --> 00:32:01,670
into this there suddenly dozens of

678
00:31:59,839 --> 00:32:04,849
cannabis extracts screened against this

679
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:06,710
thing and it was a it was a welcoming

680
00:32:04,849 --> 00:32:09,019
paper to read mainly because of the

681
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:11,539
there was definitely been a backlash of

682
00:32:09,019 --> 00:32:13,190
people talking about the ECS and kovat

683
00:32:11,539 --> 00:32:15,319
but you know when you read into the

684
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:18,170
literature of this being an RO s disease

685
00:32:15,319 --> 00:32:20,960
they're being vascular stress going on

686
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:23,420
all the comorbid patients seem to have

687
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:27,049
some overlap with cannabis patients like

688
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:30,350
cancer and COPD my sister's like a

689
00:32:27,049 --> 00:32:32,539
vascular surgeon she ceases as a ro s

690
00:32:30,349 --> 00:32:34,879
disease in the vasculature and if you

691
00:32:32,539 --> 00:32:36,920
couldn't quench that you can make

692
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:40,160
tremendous strides on limiting cytokine

693
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:42,019
storms and so Wow there's no data that

694
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:43,880
shows any prescriptive dose one could

695
00:32:42,019 --> 00:32:46,160
use today there's certainly reason to go

696
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:48,530
and investigate like what can we do in

697
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:50,180
this space right is this is a medicine

698
00:32:48,529 --> 00:32:53,329
that is not going to be in short supply

699
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:55,670
if guys can scale this up you know a

700
00:32:53,329 --> 00:32:57,349
number of candidates absolutely and if

701
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:59,390
we were to go for a clinical trial of

702
00:32:57,349 --> 00:33:00,079
course we'll have those escalation going

703
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:02,630
in first

704
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:04,759
yeah so you build an appropriate

705
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:08,060
appropriate ORS escalate even though it

706
00:33:04,759 --> 00:33:09,859
is the low you know low THC because dose

707
00:33:08,059 --> 00:33:11,599
escalation is crucially important if you

708
00:33:09,859 --> 00:33:13,639
are really going into

709
00:33:11,599 --> 00:33:15,829
you started reaching doses of THC that

710
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:18,830
are you know three milligrams in class

711
00:33:15,829 --> 00:33:21,918
so again but with in a clinical trial

712
00:33:18,829 --> 00:33:24,259
that's all very very doable and in

713
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:26,059
parallel if we were you know we're going

714
00:33:24,259 --> 00:33:28,640
for clinical trials really hoping to

715
00:33:26,058 --> 00:33:30,470
start some to get partnerships but

716
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:32,690
apparently we will still be doing the

717
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:34,940
fundamental studies like that we have

718
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:36,500
just discussed trying to understand what

719
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:39,590
exactly is going on train to pinpoint

720
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:41,538
the you know the exact mechanism of the

721
00:33:39,589 --> 00:33:43,339
perpetrators are they call them the good

722
00:33:41,538 --> 00:33:46,129
ones and what the perpetrators they're

723
00:33:43,339 --> 00:33:49,029
the good workers kind of in the extracts

724
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:51,710
so I'm curious what is it like to get

725
00:33:49,029 --> 00:33:54,558
the appropriate laboratory notice you're

726
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:56,210
just talking about Bo threes you're at

727
00:33:54,558 --> 00:33:57,889
the intersection of handling cannabis

728
00:33:56,210 --> 00:34:05,569
and BL threes there's got to be a really

729
00:33:57,890 --> 00:34:08,358
interesting regulatory climate we have

730
00:34:05,569 --> 00:34:11,119
to so we don't work with alive virus and

731
00:34:08,358 --> 00:34:14,148
and I've been working on medicinal poppy

732
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:17,139
for the past ten years so I had lice and

733
00:34:14,148 --> 00:34:27,858
deal license for a very long time so and

734
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:30,230
cannabis from 2016 we're gonna be signal

735
00:34:27,858 --> 00:34:32,418
to lab you know when we were writing the

736
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:34,460
proposal many of us the majority of us

737
00:34:32,418 --> 00:34:37,128
who I ended on the team we all have

738
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:41,809
bcl-2 lamps right so I can work with

739
00:34:37,128 --> 00:34:43,309
lentivirus for example or yeah so the

740
00:34:41,809 --> 00:34:45,799
one essentially that will not assemble

741
00:34:43,309 --> 00:34:48,710
inter-particle what that already is a

742
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:50,240
huge probability you know capacity to us

743
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:52,608
to see whether or not we inhibit the

744
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:54,108
replication of the virus itself you know

745
00:34:52,608 --> 00:34:56,358
we were actually expecting to get the

746
00:34:54,108 --> 00:34:59,299
rat work on from our colleague very very

747
00:34:56,358 --> 00:35:02,059
soon fingers crossed but and then we're

748
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:05,600
still discussed and actually with some

749
00:35:02,059 --> 00:35:08,599
regulatory folks here as to whether or

750
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:13,099
not we can use inactivated writers like

751
00:35:08,599 --> 00:35:15,799
whale virus yes within the bcl-2 setting

752
00:35:13,099 --> 00:35:17,750
and potentially there is yes but we

753
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:21,680
don't have the full answer because if we

754
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:24,849
do have it so we have gamma-irradiated

755
00:35:21,679 --> 00:35:29,409
stars here for testing room we can use

756
00:35:24,849 --> 00:35:33,759
nabil - we got a bi resources here in

757
00:35:29,409 --> 00:35:35,139
the States will offer if it's it PC ours

758
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:38,950
even though it's gamma-irradiated

759
00:35:35,139 --> 00:35:40,629
so I don't I've not put it on bureau

760
00:35:38,949 --> 00:35:44,199
cells it's not supposed to replicate

761
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:46,059
yourselves but that's probably something

762
00:35:44,199 --> 00:35:50,619
I'm hoping people who make this are

763
00:35:46,059 --> 00:35:52,960
checking for but is it's an area we were

764
00:35:50,619 --> 00:35:55,960
asked to look at a couple grows here in

765
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:59,139
Massachusetts got the trimming teams got

766
00:35:55,960 --> 00:36:00,610
hit with Kovac and they were also

767
00:35:59,139 --> 00:36:02,109
concerned that there was some bet

768
00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:03,519
there's some bat guano but getting used

769
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:05,650
in the field and they're finding all the

770
00:36:03,519 --> 00:36:09,429
chrono viruses in backbone now so we've

771
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:10,900
been just screening cannabis samples to

772
00:36:09,429 --> 00:36:13,079
see if we can pick up coated on it I

773
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:15,700
don't think we're gonna find it but it's

774
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:17,139
it's not a replicant host there but I

775
00:36:15,699 --> 00:36:18,549
don't know someone sneezes on it that's

776
00:36:17,139 --> 00:36:21,849
sick maybe but that's probably a

777
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:23,440
lightning strike event but so we got

778
00:36:21,849 --> 00:36:24,699
familiar with this but we can't take in

779
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,960
the replicated version of a either

780
00:36:24,699 --> 00:36:29,199
unless we build to be able through us

781
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:30,400
exactly and that's exactly what I've

782
00:36:29,199 --> 00:36:32,679
heard from my colleagues that were

783
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:34,599
saying that in the United States as well

784
00:36:32,679 --> 00:36:36,909
as many labs in Canada they do allow

785
00:36:34,599 --> 00:36:39,639
irradiated virus we're just waiting to

786
00:36:36,909 --> 00:36:41,409
hear from our can you write safety to

787
00:36:39,639 --> 00:36:45,730
sign off on it and if they sign off

788
00:36:41,409 --> 00:36:50,079
that's exactly what we're gonna do yeah

789
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:52,090
it's the virus the virus that all the

790
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:54,219
testing companies are using to develop

791
00:36:52,090 --> 00:36:58,570
their their tests so it's it's pretty

792
00:36:54,219 --> 00:37:08,709
widely if a helpful but getting into

793
00:36:58,570 --> 00:37:11,260
that bsl-3 is a right now you know right

794
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:14,170
now is the point you know we're dealing

795
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:17,230
with we're you know folks that have

796
00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:19,530
information good ideas good hypothesis

797
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:22,150
could push forward in ways that

798
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:24,910
typically would take forever to get

799
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:27,400
something done and nowadays it's like

800
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:30,039
how do we help so you know I think you

801
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:31,900
know I think it's just it's it's really

802
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:34,329
really impressive it's it's it's it's

803
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:36,220
solid it's you know it's hard advocacy

804
00:37:34,329 --> 00:37:37,539
hard part science and you know doors

805
00:37:36,219 --> 00:37:38,019
were opening pretty well working a

806
00:37:37,539 --> 00:37:41,409
couple

807
00:37:38,019 --> 00:37:44,199
the co-ed and kovat response and it is

808
00:37:41,409 --> 00:37:46,239
it is it particularly remarkable how

809
00:37:44,199 --> 00:37:48,368
quickly things are moving in just as

810
00:37:46,239 --> 00:37:50,379
much as what as what you've been what

811
00:37:48,369 --> 00:37:51,610
you've been doing and so you know I feel

812
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:53,410
I've got a lot of faith that you're

813
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:56,920
going to be able to find the right four

814
00:37:53,409 --> 00:37:58,389
ology partners in this and and you know

815
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:01,750
now's now is the time we need to be

816
00:37:58,389 --> 00:38:04,929
working fast and in Sciences if we're

817
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:07,630
you know just it's really impressive

818
00:38:04,929 --> 00:38:09,899
what you're doing I'm really really

819
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:13,480
honored that you've taken the time out

820
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:15,760
to put your data out there and allow

821
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:19,900
general audiences as well the scientific

822
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:22,180
audience I do see a lot of the funding

823
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:23,920
starting to open up in the in the US the

824
00:38:22,179 --> 00:38:26,199
food arts to probe in but not if

825
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:29,170
something pops up there is some tiny

826
00:38:26,199 --> 00:38:31,210
tiny amounts of funding for cannabinoids

827
00:38:29,170 --> 00:38:33,130
with regards to pain you never know

828
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:35,920
where they might open the they might

829
00:38:33,130 --> 00:38:37,119
open up a whole grant function and you

830
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:40,510
know I'm paying attention to at least

831
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:45,250
the federal grants coming through and

832
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:46,570
something that that that shows that sort

833
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:49,449
of dials in to what you're trying to do

834
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:52,690
off forward those links on to you see if

835
00:38:49,449 --> 00:38:55,000
see if you could help see if we can we

836
00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:57,700
can get some funding to help you in that

837
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:00,099
way and just you know anything we can do

838
00:38:57,699 --> 00:39:02,169
to help you know we're all in this

839
00:39:00,099 --> 00:39:05,108
together and and you don't you're

840
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:08,050
definitely a tip of the spear so it's

841
00:39:05,108 --> 00:39:11,980
it's it's it's it's it's quite quite you

842
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:13,980
know I'm kind of kind of speechless over

843
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:18,579
because I'm still processing the data

844
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:20,079
that you presented but it's it's quite

845
00:39:18,579 --> 00:39:21,608
good I mean it really it really looks

846
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:23,889
like if you could separate out any

847
00:39:21,608 --> 00:39:25,659
strain you know any any indication

848
00:39:23,889 --> 00:39:28,420
separating a positive the over

849
00:39:25,659 --> 00:39:30,789
expressions from the from the from the

850
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:33,400
under expresses you know that really

851
00:39:30,789 --> 00:39:34,960
should be a way forward to say though

852
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:36,490
though this is you know that because

853
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:38,079
that's that that seems to be the biggest

854
00:39:36,489 --> 00:39:41,559
safety issue that you can see at least

855
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:50,440
with the in vitro data exam yeah

856
00:39:41,559 --> 00:39:51,429
absolutely agree any of the folks that

857
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:53,500
might be

858
00:39:51,429 --> 00:39:58,838
come to bear to help you out I will send

859
00:39:53,500 --> 00:40:01,088
them in your direction so correct me if

860
00:39:58,838 --> 00:40:03,730
I get this wrong but it seems like you

861
00:40:01,088 --> 00:40:06,460
found that certain extract certain

862
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:10,480
strains are more or less effective in

863
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:12,818
certain paths or or through the lungs or

864
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:15,039
through the skin is that correct and if

865
00:40:12,818 --> 00:40:19,119
so do you have a theory why that might

866
00:40:15,039 --> 00:40:22,119
be the case yes it looks like there are

867
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:24,400
some strains that are actually a short

868
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:28,420
what I would call potential tissue

869
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:31,358
specificity right so it may be due to

870
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:32,829
the fact I would say probably has to do

871
00:40:31,358 --> 00:40:36,338
something with and a cannabinoid system

872
00:40:32,829 --> 00:40:39,190
not being absolutely actively expressed

873
00:40:36,338 --> 00:40:41,318
in every cell in tissue type so that

874
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:42,880
would be cutting on my hypothesis and

875
00:40:41,318 --> 00:40:45,699
we're trying now to look into this

876
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:48,250
because but in parallel as I mentioned

877
00:40:45,699 --> 00:40:50,528
we're trying to identify the strains is

878
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:53,469
local to make you know multi Portland's

879
00:40:50,528 --> 00:40:56,048
essentially the mandible hit all tissues

880
00:40:53,469 --> 00:40:58,088
properly rather than trying to say this

881
00:40:56,048 --> 00:41:00,909
is a good strain for or overuse this is

882
00:40:58,088 --> 00:41:02,798
a good strain for intestinal but I guess

883
00:41:00,909 --> 00:41:05,219
the roots are somewhere in the

884
00:41:02,798 --> 00:41:05,219
endocannabinoids

885
00:41:07,219 --> 00:41:13,368
um and you use obviously extracts to do

886
00:41:10,369 --> 00:41:15,680
your research and my takeaway was for

887
00:41:13,369 --> 00:41:20,180
anyone who's listening to this that the

888
00:41:15,679 --> 00:41:22,519
probable method of of use of anything

889
00:41:20,179 --> 00:41:24,379
that comes out of this would be extracts

890
00:41:22,519 --> 00:41:28,250
would they would take that form it it

891
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:31,210
wouldn't be smoking or vaping or that

892
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:33,769
type or how do you see that happening

893
00:41:31,210 --> 00:41:36,050
all right so the delivery method can be

894
00:41:33,769 --> 00:41:38,780
any but you're right so I think it's

895
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:42,200
better to extract what's in in there

896
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:45,019
right so probably solvent based abstract

897
00:41:42,199 --> 00:41:47,419
is the best like ethanol because it

898
00:41:45,019 --> 00:41:50,269
takes all sorts of molecules not the

899
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:53,690
only lipophilic like co2 that's great so

900
00:41:50,269 --> 00:41:56,599
but all the others and that's essential

901
00:41:53,690 --> 00:42:01,099
and then the delivery can be a nasal

902
00:41:56,599 --> 00:42:04,130
spray mouthwash even inhaler right for

903
00:42:01,099 --> 00:42:06,650
this effect but right I have no idea

904
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:12,440
what we'll get from smoking but it's

905
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:24,039
kind of counterintuitive because I was

906
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:28,820
talking to one of the colleagues so and

907
00:42:24,039 --> 00:42:31,489
what he suggested that that actually

908
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:34,220
tried to put it in the medical type of

909
00:42:31,489 --> 00:42:36,049
an inhaler some said something akin to

910
00:42:34,219 --> 00:42:38,449
the one that is used for example for ban

911
00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:40,640
telling where you can have those and in

912
00:42:38,449 --> 00:42:42,919
terms of smoke you know we did not look

913
00:42:40,639 --> 00:42:45,559
because smoke it also creates tons of

914
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:47,780
combustion products right and the we're

915
00:42:45,559 --> 00:42:50,809
articles that have suggested that

916
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:52,820
smoking itself made it like smoking

917
00:42:50,809 --> 00:42:55,549
cigarettes may it's true combustion

918
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:58,580
products may influence the h2 and the

919
00:42:55,550 --> 00:43:01,190
whole pathway so again we were a little

920
00:42:58,579 --> 00:43:04,848
bit uneasy about that but the idea is

921
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:09,380
either mouthwash or a nebulizer medical

922
00:43:04,849 --> 00:43:14,109
time Baylor or actually using some of

923
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:17,838
the extras in an pill form in oral form

924
00:43:14,108 --> 00:43:19,819
so is the cat gonna make a cameo I think

925
00:43:17,838 --> 00:43:22,088
we all want to see the cat bronwyn we

926
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:22,088
have done

927
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:44,179
just going to be a train twice what

928
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:48,300
whatever is going on may well be

929
00:43:44,179 --> 00:43:50,279
independent of THC and or CBD like it

930
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:54,180
could be a minor cannabinoid it could be

931
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:56,430
terpenes that are doing this so we I

932
00:43:54,179 --> 00:43:58,049
mean can we say what component of

933
00:43:56,429 --> 00:44:00,539
cannabis is doing this could because

934
00:43:58,050 --> 00:44:03,660
that the headlines that are picked up by

935
00:44:00,539 --> 00:44:08,269
the general press or CBD shows you know

936
00:44:03,659 --> 00:44:08,269
promise that's not what you guys said

937
00:44:09,559 --> 00:44:15,570
because CBD is a big market in u.s. and

938
00:44:13,230 --> 00:44:18,480
every person oh every company that

939
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:21,080
produces it wanted to be a big story so

940
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:25,230
that they can sell more product right so

941
00:44:21,079 --> 00:44:28,469
we have talks to so many and we always

942
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:30,420
say it is not to be it is not CBD but

943
00:44:28,469 --> 00:44:34,439
everyone who reads and wants to hear and

944
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:37,230
say it's CBD CBD so we just there is no

945
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:41,059
point of arguing you know here's the

946
00:44:37,230 --> 00:44:44,699
thing because the title says high CBD

947
00:44:41,059 --> 00:44:48,269
cannabis extracts people don't read

948
00:44:44,699 --> 00:44:50,009
beyond high CBD you know it's cannabis

949
00:44:48,269 --> 00:44:52,739
extracts and the key word is cannabis

950
00:44:50,010 --> 00:44:54,900
extracts not Heist not CBD but you know

951
00:44:52,739 --> 00:44:57,359
people read that and they sort of focus

952
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:59,220
on it you know how it is it's just but

953
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:01,620
you're right it may be a minor

954
00:44:59,219 --> 00:45:04,139
cannabinoid it may be a combination of

955
00:45:01,619 --> 00:45:07,940
several because definitely its entourage

956
00:45:04,139 --> 00:45:12,599
effect can work like that's what it's

957
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:14,369
working I'm just putting a link in the

958
00:45:12,599 --> 00:45:16,529
in the notes here that paper that talks

959
00:45:14,369 --> 00:45:19,589
about a few of the main protease

960
00:45:16,530 --> 00:45:21,750
inhibitors and this in a is one that

961
00:45:19,590 --> 00:45:23,039
popped up in that radar I think Peter

962
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:25,920
was not flying when we're discussing

963
00:45:23,039 --> 00:45:28,800
that but there's the link yeah you don't

964
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:33,000
like Kevin and I think the numbers in

965
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:34,119
your paper and and trying to I I can't

966
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:37,900
find any rhyme or

967
00:45:34,119 --> 00:45:40,119
and it's so fascinating why certain

968
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:46,349
strains will be effective and others

969
00:45:40,119 --> 00:45:51,220
that have closed rate rate ratios are or

970
00:45:46,349 --> 00:45:54,039
are not so it's it's a it's a mystery in

971
00:45:51,219 --> 00:45:58,239
the making it's fascinating it's a

972
00:45:54,039 --> 00:46:01,809
mystery that needs to be solved only the

973
00:45:58,239 --> 00:46:03,788
lines of specific pathways keys to

974
00:46:01,809 --> 00:46:05,470
tissue specificity and again that

975
00:46:03,789 --> 00:46:10,990
mystery can hold the keys to tissue

976
00:46:05,469 --> 00:46:16,469
specificity as you pursue your research

977
00:46:10,989 --> 00:46:22,868
which is the most important Avenue is it

978
00:46:16,469 --> 00:46:26,230
trying to identify other cannabinoids

979
00:46:22,869 --> 00:46:29,980
the useful ones and less useful ones or

980
00:46:26,230 --> 00:46:32,469
pathways or which do you see a priority

981
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:37,389
to the type of research that needs to be

982
00:46:32,469 --> 00:46:40,179
done you know from my side I see kind of

983
00:46:37,389 --> 00:46:43,538
two key priorities now I would want to

984
00:46:40,179 --> 00:46:46,838
see number one is more clinical research

985
00:46:43,539 --> 00:46:49,269
on the current identified ones to see

986
00:46:46,838 --> 00:46:52,659
whether or not we can do for example a

987
00:46:49,268 --> 00:46:55,449
small-scale phase one to kind of

988
00:46:52,659 --> 00:46:57,489
essentially primary phase two like have

989
00:46:55,449 --> 00:47:01,868
a little bit of phase one if need be so

990
00:46:57,489 --> 00:47:05,230
but in parallel located into these

991
00:47:01,869 --> 00:47:07,749
specific modes of action what the links

992
00:47:05,230 --> 00:47:11,349
between the role and a cannabinoid

993
00:47:07,748 --> 00:47:13,598
system in governing the effects that we

994
00:47:11,349 --> 00:47:16,568
have seen specifically in context for

995
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:18,849
example the cytokine storm because it

996
00:47:16,568 --> 00:47:20,920
looks like from the preliminary data we

997
00:47:18,849 --> 00:47:24,249
have already some of the cell lines

998
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:27,548
there is some correlation of course with

999
00:47:24,248 --> 00:47:30,879
the key receptors CB 1 CB 2 we are

1000
00:47:27,548 --> 00:47:33,068
looking at the other ones but that is

1001
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:35,588
also kind of fundamentally for research

1002
00:47:33,068 --> 00:47:37,989
kind of study that's really interesting

1003
00:47:35,588 --> 00:47:40,210
me that there will be the Avenue where I

1004
00:47:37,989 --> 00:47:43,068
would want to go in terms of any more

1005
00:47:40,210 --> 00:47:45,130
fundamental research

1006
00:47:43,068 --> 00:47:45,130
you

1007
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:54,259
let me yeah now i i'm just showing so

1008
00:47:51,858 --> 00:47:58,880
that this this is what kevin just sent

1009
00:47:54,259 --> 00:48:01,960
everybody i will i will put that link to

1010
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:06,410
the video after the the conversation

1011
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:10,690
what one question i have is between the

1012
00:48:06,409 --> 00:48:15,009
two of you you you have a lot of

1013
00:48:10,690 --> 00:48:20,088
peer-reviewed studies out there correct

1014
00:48:15,009 --> 00:48:22,818
and and so so my question is that this

1015
00:48:20,088 --> 00:48:26,960
is not peer-reviewed it's preprint right

1016
00:48:22,818 --> 00:48:28,940
so what what why did you feel that was

1017
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:32,858
there an urgency to get this information

1018
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:32,858
out there now rather than later

1019
00:48:40,239 --> 00:48:47,480
maybe four years and some papers take

1020
00:48:43,909 --> 00:48:50,838
four years to publish so especially if

1021
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:52,699
it's a controversial story the reviewers

1022
00:48:50,838 --> 00:48:54,920
will ask again for more and more

1023
00:48:52,699 --> 00:49:02,598
information you may go through 20

1024
00:48:54,920 --> 00:49:04,999
different 20 i'm not until you we have

1025
00:49:02,599 --> 00:49:07,220
submitted to peer review it's been in

1026
00:49:04,998 --> 00:49:09,889
peer you first story been there for

1027
00:49:07,219 --> 00:49:12,588
about three weeks or two months and

1028
00:49:09,889 --> 00:49:17,618
second we submit at the same time we put

1029
00:49:12,588 --> 00:49:22,639
it out there you're right because we and

1030
00:49:17,619 --> 00:49:25,519
we really wanted to recruit potential

1031
00:49:22,639 --> 00:49:28,190
partners who pay for commercial trials

1032
00:49:25,518 --> 00:49:31,038
we talked to many too many different

1033
00:49:28,190 --> 00:49:33,409
agencies you know no one give you money

1034
00:49:31,039 --> 00:49:36,289
just just like that and i was thinking

1035
00:49:33,409 --> 00:49:40,190
if we make a public outcry maybe it's

1036
00:49:36,289 --> 00:49:42,650
gonna happen the other thing is also in

1037
00:49:40,190 --> 00:49:45,079
order for even to you know to get

1038
00:49:42,650 --> 00:49:48,499
applying for grants you need to have

1039
00:49:45,079 --> 00:49:51,109
some preliminary data and right now

1040
00:49:48,498 --> 00:49:53,298
granting agencies would say one thing is

1041
00:49:51,108 --> 00:49:55,548
i will say i have preliminary data and

1042
00:49:53,298 --> 00:49:56,059
give you a picture right the other one

1043
00:49:55,548 --> 00:49:58,489
in

1044
00:49:56,059 --> 00:50:01,579
if I think it is completely enough to be

1045
00:49:58,489 --> 00:50:03,289
able to put it out there into a form of

1046
00:50:01,579 --> 00:50:05,089
preprint because they are still you know

1047
00:50:03,289 --> 00:50:07,339
you have comments your suggestions

1048
00:50:05,088 --> 00:50:08,869
people post oftentimes sometimes some

1049
00:50:07,338 --> 00:50:10,699
comments in general sometimes people

1050
00:50:08,869 --> 00:50:12,739
suggest psych white very interesting

1051
00:50:10,699 --> 00:50:16,909
things that could be added or one could

1052
00:50:12,739 --> 00:50:19,489
look into so essentially that was to you

1053
00:50:16,909 --> 00:50:21,498
know put it out to put it out to see

1054
00:50:19,489 --> 00:50:23,869
what people will say to attract

1055
00:50:21,498 --> 00:50:26,389
attention of other people who may be

1056
00:50:23,869 --> 00:50:29,778
doing similar research then immediately

1057
00:50:26,389 --> 00:50:31,998
glad to actually ask forming a team and

1058
00:50:29,778 --> 00:50:34,248
apply now for CHR as soon as a preprint

1059
00:50:31,998 --> 00:50:35,868
was out one of the colleagues who was

1060
00:50:34,248 --> 00:50:38,208
working in the similar field said oh I

1061
00:50:35,869 --> 00:50:40,519
just saw a preprint we working along the

1062
00:50:38,208 --> 00:50:42,108
same lines let's collaborate so

1063
00:50:40,518 --> 00:50:44,208
essentially because we may not

1064
00:50:42,108 --> 00:50:46,818
necessarily know who else is doing what

1065
00:50:44,208 --> 00:50:48,948
and this led to more it's synergy and

1066
00:50:46,818 --> 00:50:51,920
collaboration which is very important

1067
00:50:48,949 --> 00:50:54,798
and right now one of the really good

1068
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:56,930
scientists entrepreneurs she works in an

1069
00:50:54,798 --> 00:50:59,088
aging she was given a couple of seminars

1070
00:50:56,929 --> 00:51:01,038
and one thing she pointed out she said

1071
00:50:59,088 --> 00:51:02,900
you know right now people started

1072
00:51:01,039 --> 00:51:05,299
posting their stuff on her friends yeah

1073
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:07,699
and people are now trying to make a

1074
00:51:05,298 --> 00:51:09,380
paper paper to be perfect and to go as

1075
00:51:07,699 --> 00:51:11,959
high as possible if they see something

1076
00:51:09,380 --> 00:51:14,420
and they can see the use of it and they

1077
00:51:11,958 --> 00:51:16,548
can see importance in following up and

1078
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:18,170
carrying more research they will post

1079
00:51:16,548 --> 00:51:21,079
and then say folks this is what we found

1080
00:51:18,170 --> 00:51:24,969
it is of course being reviewed now but

1081
00:51:21,079 --> 00:51:28,189
it's there so sharing it enables quicker

1082
00:51:24,969 --> 00:51:30,019
sharing of results rather than steam

1083
00:51:28,188 --> 00:51:32,808
cooking it and trying to make you know a

1084
00:51:30,018 --> 00:51:35,058
big funny nose flash and shoot the paper

1085
00:51:32,809 --> 00:51:39,140
I didn't know into a 20 impact journal

1086
00:51:35,059 --> 00:51:41,839
right by layers and layers we may be

1087
00:51:39,139 --> 00:51:43,879
more catalyzed and collaboration that

1088
00:51:41,838 --> 00:51:47,179
will later lead to way more bigger

1089
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:50,358
papers or bigger teams I actually think

1090
00:51:47,179 --> 00:51:52,838
during pandemics like this the preprints

1091
00:51:50,358 --> 00:51:56,119
get more scrutiny than the peer review

1092
00:51:52,838 --> 00:51:57,708
you know you you can go online and see a

1093
00:51:56,119 --> 00:51:59,420
hundred different comments if you

1094
00:51:57,708 --> 00:52:01,848
remember that there is a paper that came

1095
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:04,519
out talking about an uncanny similarity

1096
00:52:01,849 --> 00:52:07,130
between HIV and SARS Kobe - and it kind

1097
00:52:04,518 --> 00:52:09,500
of wild up a lot of characteristics over

1098
00:52:07,130 --> 00:52:12,200
this thing being bioengineered Inuk

1099
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:13,789
rekt like in the course of a weekend

1100
00:52:12,199 --> 00:52:15,349
with a hundred people showing why it was

1101
00:52:13,789 --> 00:52:18,230
wrong and that and the authors agreed

1102
00:52:15,349 --> 00:52:19,460
and pulled it but you don't get that all

1103
00:52:18,230 --> 00:52:22,099
the time in a peer review particularly

1104
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:23,809
during an epidemic like this all the

1105
00:52:22,099 --> 00:52:25,460
reviewers are reviewing Kovac papers

1106
00:52:23,809 --> 00:52:26,960
like I've had one I submitted January

1107
00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:29,210
5th and I probably won't see anyone

1108
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:31,579
touch it for six months because it's not

1109
00:52:29,210 --> 00:52:33,320
really a decoded it's all the reviewers

1110
00:52:31,579 --> 00:52:35,420
are getting recruited for this topic so

1111
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:37,190
and when it does get reviewed it's gonna

1112
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:39,530
have maybe three people that review it

1113
00:52:37,190 --> 00:52:40,760
and I won't know who they are and I may

1114
00:52:39,530 --> 00:52:42,230
not necessarily get to see their

1115
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:44,120
comments depending on the journal

1116
00:52:42,230 --> 00:52:46,340
whereas when you put these pre prints

1117
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:48,559
out you can see you can see all the

1118
00:52:46,340 --> 00:52:50,750
color in the commentary of these things

1119
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:52,820
whether it's polite or not it gets

1120
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:55,789
rolled out there on Twitter and then on

1121
00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:57,410
your paper and I think it's actually

1122
00:52:55,789 --> 00:52:59,570
really refreshing that we have this

1123
00:52:57,409 --> 00:53:01,129
outlet now and everyone should of course

1124
00:52:59,570 --> 00:53:01,640
read the free prints with a little grain

1125
00:53:01,130 --> 00:53:04,070
of salt

1126
00:53:01,639 --> 00:53:05,269
read the comments sections to to see

1127
00:53:04,070 --> 00:53:09,260
what other people are saying about them

1128
00:53:05,269 --> 00:53:11,239
that's always really helpful but I you

1129
00:53:09,260 --> 00:53:12,410
know waiting six months for information

1130
00:53:11,239 --> 00:53:13,639
like this together just think about what

1131
00:53:12,409 --> 00:53:15,649
that does throughout the entire

1132
00:53:13,639 --> 00:53:19,339
scientific community if everyone's paper

1133
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:21,680
is in isolation in in quarantine for

1134
00:53:19,340 --> 00:53:23,930
embargo for six months I mean it really

1135
00:53:21,679 --> 00:53:26,419
limits the metronome on innovation by

1136
00:53:23,929 --> 00:53:28,069
doing that getting these pre prints out

1137
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:30,860
other people can start working on it

1138
00:53:28,070 --> 00:53:32,809
before it's fully reviewed and it's I

1139
00:53:30,860 --> 00:53:35,420
think it's the way to go in the future

1140
00:53:32,809 --> 00:53:36,679
it we're gonna improve on this obviously

1141
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:38,510
there's gonna be papers that slip

1142
00:53:36,679 --> 00:53:39,710
through that create you know the media

1143
00:53:38,510 --> 00:53:43,130
takes them and runs with them in the

1144
00:53:39,710 --> 00:53:44,900
wrong direction but it's we're gonna get

1145
00:53:43,130 --> 00:53:46,910
better at that I think we really need to

1146
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:49,039
speed up the rate which these things get

1147
00:53:46,909 --> 00:53:53,599
reviewed for the peer review process to

1148
00:53:49,039 --> 00:53:56,719
keep up well the thing about the media

1149
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:59,269
coverage also is that you know but out

1150
00:53:56,719 --> 00:54:01,309
there like just take the headlines and

1151
00:53:59,269 --> 00:54:06,530
run with them and I I've seen a whole

1152
00:54:01,309 --> 00:54:09,440
bunch of that on the well going yeah I'm

1153
00:54:06,530 --> 00:54:15,019
protected you know I I knew it you know

1154
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:17,150
and I'm curious you guys if if if

1155
00:54:15,019 --> 00:54:19,730
there's a message you want to put out

1156
00:54:17,150 --> 00:54:22,789
there to people who might be getting the

1157
00:54:19,730 --> 00:54:25,639
wrong message yes

1158
00:54:22,789 --> 00:54:28,160
first first and foremost because we have

1159
00:54:25,639 --> 00:54:30,828
heard this - um you're absolutely right

1160
00:54:28,159 --> 00:54:33,108
on target when people will say oh I have

1161
00:54:30,829 --> 00:54:36,859
been using cannabis very racially so

1162
00:54:33,108 --> 00:54:40,369
Colby ain't gonna hit me no boyfriend so

1163
00:54:36,858 --> 00:54:42,619
this is the fact that people have been

1164
00:54:40,369 --> 00:54:45,380
using cannabis even if they have been

1165
00:54:42,619 --> 00:54:48,019
using cannabis for medical purposes even

1166
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:51,199
people it does not necessarily mean that

1167
00:54:48,018 --> 00:54:53,358
then you are you know protected and it

1168
00:54:51,199 --> 00:54:56,509
shouldn't give people false hope

1169
00:54:53,358 --> 00:54:59,900
so the key of this study is that number

1170
00:54:56,509 --> 00:55:01,900
one we have shown preclinically that

1171
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:04,818
there are reasons to believe that

1172
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:07,209
cannabis has the potential to be

1173
00:55:04,818 --> 00:55:09,949
effective in fight against Corbitt

1174
00:55:07,208 --> 00:55:12,708
enough to believe that we can conduct

1175
00:55:09,949 --> 00:55:15,858
clinical trials and clinical trials is

1176
00:55:12,708 --> 00:55:17,509
the next step so before the trials are

1177
00:55:15,858 --> 00:55:20,808
conducted I don't think it is

1178
00:55:17,509 --> 00:55:22,519
responsible to say that cannabis besides

1179
00:55:20,809 --> 00:55:26,900
the fact that cannabis is non-generic

1180
00:55:22,518 --> 00:55:29,149
will do XYZ we haven't looked at smoking

1181
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:31,639
and in general combustion products

1182
00:55:29,150 --> 00:55:34,639
getting into the lungs they do influence

1183
00:55:31,639 --> 00:55:38,088
a stew system so that is again it was

1184
00:55:34,639 --> 00:55:41,118
with a grain of caution there but the

1185
00:55:38,088 --> 00:55:43,328
key message is we are trying to create a

1186
00:55:41,119 --> 00:55:46,189
medicine rather than a false hope and

1187
00:55:43,329 --> 00:55:48,890
trying to you know go the same way as

1188
00:55:46,188 --> 00:55:59,389
every pharmaceutical company has to go

1189
00:55:48,889 --> 00:56:03,768
about it conduct your trials and we will

1190
00:55:59,389 --> 00:56:06,759
let you go we appreciate your time and I

1191
00:56:03,768 --> 00:56:09,318
hope I hope this was a little more

1192
00:56:06,759 --> 00:56:11,568
interesting for you to talk to other

1193
00:56:09,318 --> 00:56:14,119
scientists than to talk to like the

1194
00:56:11,568 --> 00:56:22,728
press it's a pretty significant we've

1195
00:56:14,119 --> 00:56:24,679
done and I really do hope we stay in

1196
00:56:22,728 --> 00:56:27,868
touch because we now have each other's

1197
00:56:24,679 --> 00:56:30,420
emails we for sending those links

1198
00:56:27,869 --> 00:56:34,349
and I really want to continue

1199
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:41,490
communicating thank you thank you thank

1200
00:56:34,349 --> 00:56:46,380
you thank you I have a question for

1201
00:56:41,489 --> 00:56:50,389
Kevin Weisman sure hey Kevin like what

1202
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:53,730
is the current state of research

1203
00:56:50,389 --> 00:56:55,739
collaboration around cannabis just now

1204
00:56:53,730 --> 00:56:58,679
generally speaking and in the middle of

1205
00:56:55,739 --> 00:57:01,139
a pandemic if anyone knows you shall

1206
00:56:58,679 --> 00:57:05,009
well that's it's been challenging

1207
00:57:01,139 --> 00:57:07,618
because some labs are shut down you know

1208
00:57:05,009 --> 00:57:11,699
I know that I spoke to Rafi a few weeks

1209
00:57:07,619 --> 00:57:14,329
ago his lab in Israel that shut down so

1210
00:57:11,699 --> 00:57:17,129
there you go Godfather's over space

1211
00:57:14,329 --> 00:57:18,869
can't get to get the lab I think it's

1212
00:57:17,130 --> 00:57:21,930
open now but you know there's a period

1213
00:57:18,869 --> 00:57:24,930
where that was shut down we got saved by

1214
00:57:21,929 --> 00:57:26,818
the grace of good luck we're considered

1215
00:57:24,929 --> 00:57:28,528
essential because we're making reagents

1216
00:57:26,818 --> 00:57:30,358
for testing for pathogens on cannabis

1217
00:57:28,528 --> 00:57:32,849
and the cannabis industry was deemed

1218
00:57:30,358 --> 00:57:35,219
essential here in mass so we didn't get

1219
00:57:32,849 --> 00:57:37,710
shut down but you know I know a lot of

1220
00:57:35,219 --> 00:57:39,480
other people that have that that

1221
00:57:37,710 --> 00:57:41,818
complicate this a lot of the academic

1222
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:44,460
laboratories actually are on half staff

1223
00:57:41,818 --> 00:57:46,710
so when you're wanting to collaborate

1224
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:49,739
with people in Cambridge there they're

1225
00:57:46,710 --> 00:57:53,818
kind of on hit-or-miss schedules right

1226
00:57:49,739 --> 00:57:55,798
now so that can be tricky there is also

1227
00:57:53,818 --> 00:57:57,838
I think a big migration for a lot of

1228
00:57:55,798 --> 00:57:59,699
people in the space to start getting

1229
00:57:57,838 --> 00:58:02,068
pulled into the vortex of studying this

1230
00:57:59,699 --> 00:58:04,528
which is naturally challenging I think

1231
00:58:02,068 --> 00:58:06,239
for any small company is can you pin it

1232
00:58:04,528 --> 00:58:07,798
should you pivot you you should you be

1233
00:58:06,239 --> 00:58:09,449
looking at this right now is it going to

1234
00:58:07,798 --> 00:58:10,829
go away in six months and then we're

1235
00:58:09,449 --> 00:58:13,379
gonna waste all of our effort on this

1236
00:58:10,829 --> 00:58:15,568
these are unknowns you know it's a lot

1237
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:20,430
of risk for small entities to make

1238
00:58:15,568 --> 00:58:22,230
pivots like that so it's you know I

1239
00:58:20,429 --> 00:58:24,509
certainly hope there's more work like

1240
00:58:22,230 --> 00:58:26,338
what what they're doing because I think

1241
00:58:24,509 --> 00:58:29,039
there's so much hope and promise in the

1242
00:58:26,338 --> 00:58:30,808
ECS and today if you're a physician you

1243
00:58:29,039 --> 00:58:32,549
really can't recommend this you can't

1244
00:58:30,809 --> 00:58:35,430
say hey yeah you should take cannabis

1245
00:58:32,548 --> 00:58:36,989
because of one esoteric hcv paper that's

1246
00:58:35,429 --> 00:58:40,139
out there you know that's that's not

1247
00:58:36,989 --> 00:58:41,579
that's that's that's not what the FDA

1248
00:58:40,139 --> 00:58:43,679
would approve of there the real

1249
00:58:41,579 --> 00:58:48,840
controlling over the language or on

1250
00:58:43,679 --> 00:58:50,789
medical use at the same time if I were

1251
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:53,160
position and someone asked me should you

1252
00:58:50,789 --> 00:58:56,219
stop taking your meds I'd be equally

1253
00:58:53,159 --> 00:58:58,170
frustrated with my answers I don't think

1254
00:58:56,219 --> 00:59:00,329
you should change course I would

1255
00:58:58,170 --> 00:59:02,099
probably veer away from smoking it and

1256
00:59:00,329 --> 00:59:03,509
and maybe stick with more edibles than

1257
00:59:02,099 --> 00:59:06,480
you can with anything that my ear take

1258
00:59:03,510 --> 00:59:08,210
your lungs but I wouldn't want to be in

1259
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:10,260
the position of telling somebody that

1260
00:59:08,210 --> 00:59:11,460
you know you should stop taking the

1261
00:59:10,260 --> 00:59:12,960
medicine that's working for you because

1262
00:59:11,460 --> 00:59:16,110
we don't know what this is going to do

1263
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:17,639
with this particular virus you know the

1264
00:59:16,110 --> 00:59:18,900
numbers and the frequency which is

1265
00:59:17,639 --> 00:59:21,869
infects people right now is

1266
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:24,269
extraordinarily low and so you know it's

1267
00:59:21,869 --> 00:59:25,949
a complicated time without a doubt it's

1268
00:59:24,269 --> 00:59:27,509
certainly affected us we pivoted a

1269
00:59:25,949 --> 00:59:29,549
little bit of effort toward trying to

1270
00:59:27,510 --> 00:59:30,900
detect this as a foam light whether it's

1271
00:59:29,550 --> 00:59:34,710
going to be in the environment anywhere

1272
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:37,380
and people's fertilizer or on trimmers

1273
00:59:34,710 --> 00:59:40,650
or on plants we're gonna have a test

1274
00:59:37,380 --> 00:59:43,410
that can pick up COBIT on SARS Toby - at

1275
00:59:40,650 --> 00:59:45,150
least on cannabis I don't think it's

1276
00:59:43,409 --> 00:59:46,440
gonna get high use for a long period of

1277
00:59:45,150 --> 00:59:49,110
time but we don't want to be caught

1278
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:51,869
flat-footed if it ever breaks out if

1279
00:59:49,110 --> 00:59:53,970
whatever gets found that one of these

1280
00:59:51,869 --> 00:59:56,819
dispensaries or grows that have

1281
00:59:53,969 --> 00:59:58,919
employees that had coded put something

1282
00:59:56,820 --> 01:00:00,600
on an inhaled product by accident and it

1283
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:03,900
makes it to a patient or Industry we

1284
01:00:00,599 --> 01:00:05,429
shut down overnight so that scares the

1285
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:07,829
hell out of us that if we if we don't

1286
01:00:05,429 --> 01:00:09,929
have that test it's it's a liability so

1287
01:00:07,829 --> 01:00:13,920
we're building things as insurance

1288
01:00:09,929 --> 01:00:15,869
policies that may never get used so that

1289
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:19,380
might be deemed a distraction in a year

1290
01:00:15,869 --> 01:00:21,989
from now so yeah it's it's definitely

1291
01:00:19,380 --> 01:00:27,660
chaos I think is the right term for

1292
01:00:21,989 --> 01:00:28,799
what's going on right now the scientists

1293
01:00:27,659 --> 01:00:30,719
are now and I'm not a couple

1294
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:32,580
collaborations to have put proposals out

1295
01:00:30,719 --> 01:00:34,889
and and it seems as though we can't do

1296
01:00:32,579 --> 01:00:37,739
the experiments so there's a lot of

1297
01:00:34,889 --> 01:00:41,519
writing writing and zoom meetings are

1298
01:00:37,739 --> 01:00:45,299
basically the nature of Sciences has

1299
01:00:41,519 --> 01:00:47,009
turned into that and there is a there's

1300
01:00:45,300 --> 01:00:51,030
a happy you know sort of happy ending

1301
01:00:47,010 --> 01:00:53,190
here is I read something from the DoD

1302
01:00:51,030 --> 01:00:55,500
they're issuing a Newton award and their

1303
01:00:53,190 --> 01:00:57,780
whole description was when

1304
01:00:55,500 --> 01:01:00,630
Newton was dealing with the black you

1305
01:00:57,780 --> 01:01:05,610
know when they had the Black Death that

1306
01:01:00,630 --> 01:01:07,470
he was on furlough yeah we're all sort

1307
01:01:05,610 --> 01:01:09,030
of like the white people to be stuck

1308
01:01:07,469 --> 01:01:10,919
with the pandemic right now because

1309
01:01:09,030 --> 01:01:13,230
we're the guys that would be like okay I

1310
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:13,800
have time on my hand I gotta get stuff

1311
01:01:13,230 --> 01:01:16,079
done

1312
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:19,530
I have the skill set to go do something

1313
01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:21,000
yeah so it's changing we're all starting

1314
01:01:19,530 --> 01:01:23,280
to change a little bit and I think as

1315
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:25,739
scientists were what we're getting you

1316
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:28,019
know we were you know yes it's it's

1317
01:01:25,739 --> 01:01:30,179
there's some competitiveness and there's

1318
01:01:28,019 --> 01:01:33,300
you know there's you guys involved but

1319
01:01:30,179 --> 01:01:36,269
there is this the collaborative effort I

1320
01:01:33,300 --> 01:01:37,830
think is returning to the sciences where

1321
01:01:36,269 --> 01:01:40,679
over years and years and years of

1322
01:01:37,829 --> 01:01:42,719
funding cuts and difficulties and you

1323
01:01:40,679 --> 01:01:45,569
know selling our souls to be seized at

1324
01:01:42,719 --> 01:01:48,149
times and I think there there is the V

1325
01:01:45,570 --> 01:01:49,980
Caesar now you know the money is looking

1326
01:01:48,150 --> 01:01:52,650
at there's a lot of funding coming in to

1327
01:01:49,980 --> 01:01:54,510
kovat I think there is a sort of like

1328
01:01:52,650 --> 01:01:56,849
okay let the experts do what they need

1329
01:01:54,510 --> 01:01:58,880
to do you know don't put them under your

1330
01:01:56,849 --> 01:02:00,480
thumb so there is a there is a

1331
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:02,010
appreciation I think a renewed

1332
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:03,900
appreciation for the scientists doing

1333
01:02:02,010 --> 01:02:06,120
the job going into the whole concept of

1334
01:02:03,900 --> 01:02:09,000
this of these preprints like this was

1335
01:02:06,119 --> 01:02:11,849
just a good idea internally up among

1336
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:14,400
scientists and now everybody knows how

1337
01:02:11,849 --> 01:02:15,449
to get access to the first data so I

1338
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:18,210
think that's kind of an interesting

1339
01:02:15,449 --> 01:02:19,619
phenomenon where as scientists were you

1340
01:02:18,210 --> 01:02:21,510
know we have to advocate for certain

1341
01:02:19,619 --> 01:02:23,159
things and exercise caution in an

1342
01:02:21,510 --> 01:02:25,350
environment I'm gonna actually get

1343
01:02:23,159 --> 01:02:29,879
accomplished the job of solving these

1344
01:02:25,349 --> 01:02:31,619
problems in record times in the context

1345
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:33,630
of this tremendous amount of chaos and

1346
01:02:31,619 --> 01:02:36,359
chatter and I think we're all trained

1347
01:02:33,630 --> 01:02:40,320
we're all kind of cream to deal with a

1348
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:43,769
level of of chaos just not in in a

1349
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:45,660
global sense that's kind of my thoughts

1350
01:02:43,769 --> 01:02:47,250
on it I sort of am I you know a little

1351
01:02:45,659 --> 01:02:49,649
bit of idealistic but when I saw that

1352
01:02:47,250 --> 01:02:51,659
the fact that the description of what

1353
01:02:49,650 --> 01:02:53,910
happened with Newton I was like oh great

1354
01:02:51,659 --> 01:02:56,789
we're ready for waiting for a scientific

1355
01:02:53,909 --> 01:02:59,219
boom if we could just get past a little

1356
01:02:56,789 --> 01:03:02,009
bit of the chaos and and manage to keep

1357
01:02:59,219 --> 01:03:03,239
our you know keep some integrity with

1358
01:03:02,010 --> 01:03:04,740
the fact that we're the guys that are

1359
01:03:03,239 --> 01:03:08,209
both the skeptics and the ones that have

1360
01:03:04,739 --> 01:03:08,209
to say you know okay everybody calm down

1361
01:03:09,358 --> 01:03:22,259
are you actually zooming from a boat

1362
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:29,660
right now I'm zooming from a boat can

1363
01:03:22,259 --> 01:03:38,458
you give us a shot of your view camera

1364
01:03:29,659 --> 01:03:41,308
yeah early there be kayakers and whatnot

1365
01:03:38,458 --> 01:03:48,509
so we're us we're all socially distanced

1366
01:03:41,309 --> 01:03:53,630
by by nature of the water set where are

1367
01:03:48,509 --> 01:03:56,548
you right now is awesome all right

1368
01:03:53,630 --> 01:03:58,798
Connecticut I mean I'm in Beverly masse

1369
01:03:56,548 --> 01:04:11,369
and the background is so boring I had to

1370
01:03:58,798 --> 01:04:13,199
put up something else so yeah you can

1371
01:04:11,369 --> 01:04:14,849
green screen function on there put any

1372
01:04:13,199 --> 01:04:17,689
pick up there and this is a picture that

1373
01:04:14,849 --> 01:04:20,789
face genomics sent me of a Jamaican lion

1374
01:04:17,690 --> 01:04:23,009
they work on the genome and sent us a

1375
01:04:20,789 --> 01:04:31,349
portrait of this thing so it's become my

1376
01:04:23,009 --> 01:04:32,608
zoom I do think this whole you know like

1377
01:04:31,349 --> 01:04:37,140
and I want to address your point about

1378
01:04:32,608 --> 01:04:39,119
that this might be gone in six months I

1379
01:04:37,139 --> 01:04:42,150
think the virology community is starting

1380
01:04:39,119 --> 01:04:45,209
to realize that that we will you know

1381
01:04:42,150 --> 01:04:46,739
we'll get through kovat but this will

1382
01:04:45,208 --> 01:04:50,038
this will be done would be a normal

1383
01:04:46,739 --> 01:04:52,380
thing we're the rapid preparation and

1384
01:04:50,039 --> 01:04:54,869
knowing what to do you know hands down

1385
01:04:52,380 --> 01:04:56,459
the next time and so I think this whole

1386
01:04:54,869 --> 01:04:58,108
everybody's real I mean none of us

1387
01:04:56,458 --> 01:04:59,429
overall just my virology friends are out

1388
01:04:58,108 --> 01:05:00,838
of work right now I'm like you're you

1389
01:04:59,429 --> 01:05:02,759
know you're getting promoted you know I

1390
01:05:00,838 --> 01:05:04,858
mean there's a lot of the virologists

1391
01:05:02,759 --> 01:05:06,568
just didn't really get a lot of a lot of

1392
01:05:04,858 --> 01:05:09,358
the boom you know everything went into

1393
01:05:06,568 --> 01:05:15,239
you know kind of base cancer in a you

1394
01:05:09,358 --> 01:05:17,639
need yeah and and so I think it's it's

1395
01:05:15,239 --> 01:05:18,719
it's it's going to bring some news I

1396
01:05:17,639 --> 01:05:23,068
think it's going to bring some new

1397
01:05:18,719 --> 01:05:25,318
scientific assets to the storyline that

1398
01:05:23,068 --> 01:05:27,239
from from you know collaborators and

1399
01:05:25,318 --> 01:05:29,728
colleagues that you know we're not

1400
01:05:27,239 --> 01:05:31,588
really getting a fair fair you know

1401
01:05:29,728 --> 01:05:33,978
getting you know able to be able to get

1402
01:05:31,588 --> 01:05:36,900
careers out of what they were doing so

1403
01:05:33,978 --> 01:05:39,899
you know so I think there's there's some

1404
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:42,119
of realignment going on and and you know

1405
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:43,410
the smart wolf you know I don't say the

1406
01:05:42,119 --> 01:05:44,880
strong will survive but it's kind of

1407
01:05:43,409 --> 01:05:47,879
like the smart will will make it through

1408
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:50,160
and well I got kind of a lot of faith in

1409
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:52,289
science now like after after stepping

1410
01:05:50,159 --> 01:05:53,848
away from science and coming back to

1411
01:05:52,289 --> 01:05:56,430
science and be like do I want to put up

1412
01:05:53,849 --> 01:05:58,680
with this shit do I want to do and and

1413
01:05:56,429 --> 01:06:00,149
to realize that this is what we do like

1414
01:05:58,679 --> 01:06:02,009
there's you can't take this away from

1415
01:06:00,150 --> 01:06:05,298
what this is but we're going to do it no

1416
01:06:02,009 --> 01:06:08,369
matter what I think it's it's gonna lend

1417
01:06:05,298 --> 01:06:11,429
some some new some new eyes and ears to

1418
01:06:08,369 --> 01:06:14,099
the to the to our to our world well

1419
01:06:11,429 --> 01:06:16,318
there's certainly a I think everyone in

1420
01:06:14,099 --> 01:06:18,479
the investment community was not

1421
01:06:16,318 --> 01:06:20,608
expecting cannabis to be deemed

1422
01:06:18,478 --> 01:06:22,768
essential through this I mean if there

1423
01:06:20,608 --> 01:06:25,139
was any investor that was worried about

1424
01:06:22,768 --> 01:06:27,629
federal legalization and if it would

1425
01:06:25,139 --> 01:06:30,659
reverse itself I think those fears are

1426
01:06:27,630 --> 01:06:32,430
over having Phoenix survive this is

1427
01:06:30,659 --> 01:06:35,248
something that I think is a real strong

1428
01:06:32,429 --> 01:06:36,690
testament that and you know I've been

1429
01:06:35,248 --> 01:06:38,548
kind of scratching me ahead as to why I

1430
01:06:36,690 --> 01:06:41,130
can the hell did we look out like what

1431
01:06:38,548 --> 01:06:42,599
what what happened that this that was

1432
01:06:41,130 --> 01:06:44,608
deemed this way

1433
01:06:42,599 --> 01:06:46,440
maybe it's the medical base you know

1434
01:06:44,608 --> 01:06:48,179
they they're really worried that if all

1435
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:49,920
these patients ran to the hospital right

1436
01:06:48,179 --> 01:06:53,368
now to get alternative meds it'd be a

1437
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:56,519
disaster and it's just so leave them

1438
01:06:53,369 --> 01:06:58,949
open and and it means so every state was

1439
01:06:56,518 --> 01:07:01,048
different mass only led medical be open

1440
01:06:58,949 --> 01:07:03,568
and closed rec and they're opening rec

1441
01:07:01,048 --> 01:07:05,009
now but and you know of course those

1442
01:07:03,568 --> 01:07:06,748
people are gonna revert back to getting

1443
01:07:05,009 --> 01:07:07,920
cards and some of them are gonna go to

1444
01:07:06,748 --> 01:07:11,248
the black market and there could be

1445
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:12,630
issues right there but um there you know

1446
01:07:11,248 --> 01:07:14,399
what was kind of interesting through all

1447
01:07:12,630 --> 01:07:17,699
this is we were just dealing with this

1448
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:19,889
valley thing and you know a valley came

1449
01:07:17,699 --> 01:07:23,028
to the table with very similar symptoms

1450
01:07:19,889 --> 01:07:25,348
um you know it had ground-glass

1451
01:07:23,028 --> 01:07:27,659
capacities in the lungs and created

1452
01:07:25,349 --> 01:07:28,949
pneumonia but no one has any evidence is

1453
01:07:27,659 --> 01:07:31,170
infectious and you know it's probably

1454
01:07:28,949 --> 01:07:33,389
vitamin D acetate but it was just

1455
01:07:31,170 --> 01:07:35,789
starting to tell off this thing came on

1456
01:07:33,389 --> 01:07:36,719
right and so naturally there was people

1457
01:07:35,789 --> 01:07:37,950
here that were

1458
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:40,379
you know Charlie Baker was quite

1459
01:07:37,949 --> 01:07:42,118
concerned about a valley and commit you

1460
01:07:40,380 --> 01:07:45,720
know closed a lot of the fake shops down

1461
01:07:42,119 --> 01:07:47,190
in Canyon State but just opened to is

1462
01:07:45,719 --> 01:07:49,108
like what happens when these two things

1463
01:07:47,190 --> 01:07:51,838
intersect you know well these things

1464
01:07:49,108 --> 01:07:53,789
have similar symptom apology they

1465
01:07:51,838 --> 01:07:56,549
probably exacerbated other could be a

1466
01:07:53,789 --> 01:07:58,139
real problem but you know I was seeing

1467
01:07:56,550 --> 01:08:00,690
that wave as oh no this is going to

1468
01:07:58,139 --> 01:08:02,400
crash the campus market for a very long

1469
01:08:00,690 --> 01:08:06,269
time in the next thing you know all your

1470
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:07,950
essential and so our investors and on

1471
01:08:06,269 --> 01:08:09,780
any other invested in space just kind of

1472
01:08:07,949 --> 01:08:12,568
did a 180 on that saying wait a minute

1473
01:08:09,780 --> 01:08:16,230
you guys are you know you're in a

1474
01:08:12,568 --> 01:08:17,640
volatility you know your your non

1475
01:08:16,229 --> 01:08:19,349
correlated to the rest of the market

1476
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:21,298
your open and everyone's closed we want

1477
01:08:19,350 --> 01:08:23,789
to park more money in those types of

1478
01:08:21,298 --> 01:08:25,560
businesses because they're likely to

1479
01:08:23,789 --> 01:08:29,399
sustain the next shutdown that's gonna

1480
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:32,069
occur yeah we those just chalk it up as

1481
01:08:29,399 --> 01:08:34,909
things you would never predict right now

1482
01:08:32,069 --> 01:08:38,100
yeah absolutely we I got brought in and

1483
01:08:34,909 --> 01:08:40,108
through some CLIA labs we're going to

1484
01:08:38,100 --> 01:08:43,440
preparing up with cannabis testing labs

1485
01:08:40,109 --> 01:08:45,539
so the clinical like to deal with to

1486
01:08:43,439 --> 01:08:47,488
deal with yes we so as a bunch it was it

1487
01:08:45,539 --> 01:08:50,819
was it was just this odd all of a sudden

1488
01:08:47,488 --> 01:08:52,829
I was on a zoom call and and and there

1489
01:08:50,819 --> 01:08:55,770
was all these scientists all from the

1490
01:08:52,829 --> 01:08:57,420
either CLIA labs cannabis testing lab

1491
01:08:55,770 --> 01:09:00,509
environmental testing labs health

1492
01:08:57,420 --> 01:09:02,909
testing labs all trying to bring assets

1493
01:09:00,509 --> 01:09:05,130
and capacity to the scenario and in

1494
01:09:02,909 --> 01:09:06,479
California they didn't they didn't

1495
01:09:05,130 --> 01:09:08,279
really you know they're still not sure

1496
01:09:06,479 --> 01:09:11,939
whether they're going to allow cannabis

1497
01:09:08,279 --> 01:09:14,160
labs to to to to switch doing clinical

1498
01:09:11,939 --> 01:09:16,318
apps but you basically have the people

1499
01:09:14,159 --> 01:09:17,909
you know you basically have your assets

1500
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:19,529
you just you know there's a just a

1501
01:09:17,909 --> 01:09:21,238
couple of things to go through still so

1502
01:09:19,529 --> 01:09:23,250
there was a whole little organization

1503
01:09:21,238 --> 01:09:26,039
that we started because we named it

1504
01:09:23,250 --> 01:09:27,180
pandemic laboratory Action Network and

1505
01:09:26,039 --> 01:09:30,000
it literally was just all these

1506
01:09:27,180 --> 01:09:33,600
different equipment suppliers and rage

1507
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:35,909
and suppliers and and and it's it you

1508
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:37,319
know things started pair off and and

1509
01:09:35,909 --> 01:09:39,358
some of these founders testing lab

1510
01:09:37,319 --> 01:09:40,830
started to reorient completely to get to

1511
01:09:39,359 --> 01:09:43,469
get CLIA certified to handle the

1512
01:09:40,829 --> 01:09:45,179
overflows so it's been a you know this

1513
01:09:43,469 --> 01:09:47,130
is really like in an area where the

1514
01:09:45,179 --> 01:09:49,170
cannabis testing labs were getting hit

1515
01:09:47,130 --> 01:09:50,548
hard and then the CLIA labs are doing

1516
01:09:49,170 --> 01:09:52,399
okay but there was on the

1517
01:09:50,548 --> 01:09:55,050
side of things there was a whole

1518
01:09:52,399 --> 01:09:57,238
bottoming out of the CLIA labs in the

1519
01:09:55,050 --> 01:09:58,980
last couple years so yeah we were one of

1520
01:09:57,238 --> 01:10:05,399
the perfect storm right oh you're one of

1521
01:09:58,979 --> 01:10:07,738
them so yeah we got out we were clean so

1522
01:10:05,399 --> 01:10:10,348
that this is actually topic number two I

1523
01:10:07,738 --> 01:10:12,089
wanted to jump into so let's start with

1524
01:10:10,349 --> 01:10:14,730
kind of an intro to the topic so

1525
01:10:12,090 --> 01:10:16,920
basically in all these states there are

1526
01:10:14,729 --> 01:10:19,019
kind of bottlenecks of testing correct

1527
01:10:16,920 --> 01:10:26,489
and and what's CLIA stand for what's the

1528
01:10:19,020 --> 01:10:28,770
acronym okay so so there are bottlenecks

1529
01:10:26,488 --> 01:10:31,888
in terms of you know if we want to

1530
01:10:28,770 --> 01:10:34,199
attest large portions of populations we

1531
01:10:31,889 --> 01:10:36,929
just we don't have the capacity right

1532
01:10:34,198 --> 01:10:38,969
now correct well we have the PCR

1533
01:10:36,929 --> 01:10:41,789
capacity we don't have the regulatory

1534
01:10:38,969 --> 01:10:43,618
capacity if you will to get a CLIA

1535
01:10:41,789 --> 01:10:45,420
license can take you a year it took us

1536
01:10:43,618 --> 01:10:47,429
probably two or three years to get it in

1537
01:10:45,420 --> 01:10:49,380
New York at least for DNA sequencing

1538
01:10:47,429 --> 01:10:51,300
which is maybe a little bit more complex

1539
01:10:49,380 --> 01:10:53,489
but they are still asking for high

1540
01:10:51,300 --> 01:10:56,279
complexity laboratory CLIA licenses for

1541
01:10:53,488 --> 01:10:57,959
kovat testing so that's not a fast

1542
01:10:56,279 --> 01:10:59,670
process you usually have to get Kap

1543
01:10:57,960 --> 01:11:01,289
involved which is I think it's the

1544
01:10:59,670 --> 01:11:03,420
college for American physicians to come

1545
01:11:01,289 --> 01:11:07,170
in and audit your laboratory and look at

1546
01:11:03,420 --> 01:11:10,500
all your workflows and it's it's it's a

1547
01:11:07,170 --> 01:11:13,139
it's a long I would say it does make

1548
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:14,670
sense to do for you know sequencing

1549
01:11:13,139 --> 01:11:16,828
where you're you might be making

1550
01:11:14,670 --> 01:11:18,599
life-or-death decisions on someone like

1551
01:11:16,828 --> 01:11:20,130
with a bracket mutation and whether

1552
01:11:18,599 --> 01:11:23,569
they're gonna you know do a cancer

1553
01:11:20,130 --> 01:11:26,489
biopsy or cut something off you know but

1554
01:11:23,569 --> 01:11:28,289
PCR is really simple and people can do

1555
01:11:26,488 --> 01:11:30,959
some of this in the field and while we

1556
01:11:28,289 --> 01:11:33,630
want there to be all types of great

1557
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:35,969
audit trails I think cannabis labs are

1558
01:11:33,630 --> 01:11:37,559
fully capable doing it they have those

1559
01:11:35,969 --> 01:11:39,270
things in place and they can track

1560
01:11:37,559 --> 01:11:41,340
samples and patients can always get

1561
01:11:39,270 --> 01:11:43,469
retested when there's error there's

1562
01:11:41,340 --> 01:11:44,909
there's a host of no one's expecting

1563
01:11:43,469 --> 01:11:46,828
these tests right now to be a hundred

1564
01:11:44,908 --> 01:11:48,960
percent sensitivity and specificity they

1565
01:11:46,828 --> 01:11:50,429
all know that there are false negatives

1566
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:52,980
and they're all false polished positives

1567
01:11:50,429 --> 01:11:54,868
from the tests and that in most cases

1568
01:11:52,979 --> 01:11:57,479
hospital settings are requiring multiple

1569
01:11:54,868 --> 01:11:59,039
test release somebody just to have some

1570
01:11:57,479 --> 01:12:01,558
error correction of the process so I do

1571
01:11:59,039 --> 01:12:03,960
think if there's really a shortage I'd

1572
01:12:01,559 --> 01:12:04,409
rather have labs like cannabis labs and

1573
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:07,529
no one

1574
01:12:04,409 --> 01:12:09,720
qpcr running the excess capacity they're

1575
01:12:07,529 --> 01:12:12,389
not running anything at all like that

1576
01:12:09,720 --> 01:12:14,430
that I think is doable but you know

1577
01:12:12,390 --> 01:12:18,440
that's that's that's challenging to get

1578
01:12:14,430 --> 01:12:21,710
the FDA to necessarily create and

1579
01:12:18,439 --> 01:12:25,079
Michael that's going to put oh

1580
01:12:21,710 --> 01:12:27,180
so these cannabis testing labs in

1581
01:12:25,079 --> 01:12:31,289
California have kind of come together

1582
01:12:27,180 --> 01:12:33,060
and stepped up to try to basically

1583
01:12:31,289 --> 01:12:39,779
repurposed you know their capabilities

1584
01:12:33,060 --> 01:12:41,550
to covin 19 testing correct yeah that's

1585
01:12:39,779 --> 01:12:43,139
the it's well it's not just the count

1586
01:12:41,550 --> 01:12:44,430
there is it there's a there's a whole

1587
01:12:43,140 --> 01:12:47,160
when it comes down to testing folks at

1588
01:12:44,430 --> 01:12:50,730
PCR I mean Robert probably can notice

1589
01:12:47,159 --> 01:12:53,519
this but you know it sounds like because

1590
01:12:50,729 --> 01:12:56,339
he's been in but you have basically a

1591
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:57,540
clinical trajectory that labs are in and

1592
01:12:56,340 --> 01:13:00,210
then you have pretty much everybody else

1593
01:12:57,539 --> 01:13:02,850
and kind of is testing labs are in the

1594
01:13:00,210 --> 01:13:06,119
everybody else category so some of the

1595
01:13:02,850 --> 01:13:08,910
wording in there's CLIA waivers but you

1596
01:13:06,119 --> 01:13:11,939
can't you can't get CLIA waiver for high

1597
01:13:08,909 --> 01:13:14,130
complexity testing there's employee you

1598
01:13:11,939 --> 01:13:17,369
know there's like several different you

1599
01:13:14,130 --> 01:13:20,340
have to have board-certified CLIA you

1600
01:13:17,369 --> 01:13:22,229
know CLIA accredited staff that are

1601
01:13:20,340 --> 01:13:24,119
already certified for the to do this

1602
01:13:22,229 --> 01:13:25,769
type of workers and a lot of it is

1603
01:13:24,119 --> 01:13:28,619
logistics of knowing you know knowing

1604
01:13:25,770 --> 01:13:33,060
what the whole safety and health and

1605
01:13:28,619 --> 01:13:34,769
being able to to to to operate in a high

1606
01:13:33,060 --> 01:13:35,730
complexity fashion and so that's a you

1607
01:13:34,770 --> 01:13:39,030
know these these folks go through

1608
01:13:35,729 --> 01:13:41,879
training specific before that the

1609
01:13:39,029 --> 01:13:45,630
equipment was equipment and rage and so

1610
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:47,670
the biggest supply chain issues reagents

1611
01:13:45,630 --> 01:13:49,650
were key so you know and a lot of these

1612
01:13:47,670 --> 01:13:51,090
labs for there's folks that have already

1613
01:13:49,649 --> 01:13:52,619
have you know they have deep net deep

1614
01:13:51,090 --> 01:13:55,110
networks in terms of reagents and

1615
01:13:52,619 --> 01:13:57,269
supplies so so the bottlenecks have been

1616
01:13:55,109 --> 01:13:59,009
you know reagents and equipment and so

1617
01:13:57,270 --> 01:14:02,000
the thinking was that if we can just

1618
01:13:59,010 --> 01:14:04,230
activate you know get labs activated and

1619
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:06,479
you know there there hasn't you know

1620
01:14:04,229 --> 01:14:08,819
it's it's it's a the the it's an

1621
01:14:06,479 --> 01:14:10,739
intrapreneur II 'el art like you have a

1622
01:14:08,819 --> 01:14:12,239
lab you have to get through some

1623
01:14:10,739 --> 01:14:14,880
certifications California

1624
01:14:12,239 --> 01:14:16,739
there has been some you know some

1625
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:18,180
descriptions that because they can't do

1626
01:14:16,739 --> 01:14:19,889
the site visits the

1627
01:14:18,180 --> 01:14:22,140
Khaleel some some CLIA labs are being

1628
01:14:19,890 --> 01:14:24,570
approved in a rather expedited fashion

1629
01:14:22,140 --> 01:14:29,039
to sort of increase that capacitance and

1630
01:14:24,569 --> 01:14:31,109
crease that capacity I've got a day a

1631
01:14:29,039 --> 01:14:32,250
phone a day of phone calls talking

1632
01:14:31,109 --> 01:14:34,229
there's there's some different assays

1633
01:14:32,250 --> 01:14:37,739
that are that are not that I don't

1634
01:14:34,229 --> 01:14:39,689
require as much complexity there's these

1635
01:14:37,739 --> 01:14:43,050
isothermal assays that are coming out

1636
01:14:39,689 --> 01:14:44,939
that are that are based on a not needing

1637
01:14:43,050 --> 01:14:47,039
a thermo cycler or needing you know

1638
01:14:44,939 --> 01:14:50,909
needing as much equipment in order to

1639
01:14:47,039 --> 01:14:52,949
achieve a desired result there look

1640
01:14:50,909 --> 01:14:54,630
there's tests that or you know that that

1641
01:14:52,949 --> 01:14:56,189
were done in low resource countries or

1642
01:14:54,630 --> 01:14:58,710
countries that didn't have resources and

1643
01:14:56,189 --> 01:15:00,000
didn't have the types of equipment that

1644
01:14:58,710 --> 01:15:02,010
we have here in the United States they

1645
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:04,890
there's some different techniques that

1646
01:15:02,010 --> 01:15:07,039
are being approved in by the FDA right

1647
01:15:04,890 --> 01:15:09,480
now it's a small small handful of it

1648
01:15:07,039 --> 01:15:15,750
small handful in comparison to like the

1649
01:15:09,479 --> 01:15:17,089
general PCR but the the nature is is you

1650
01:15:15,750 --> 01:15:19,380
know it's a it's an actively evolving

1651
01:15:17,090 --> 01:15:21,180
scenario and I don't think anybody has

1652
01:15:19,380 --> 01:15:24,890
the answer like we don't really we are a

1653
01:15:21,180 --> 01:15:27,810
biotech rich country so we have

1654
01:15:24,890 --> 01:15:28,350
tremendous we have all the equipment we

1655
01:15:27,810 --> 01:15:30,450
need

1656
01:15:28,350 --> 01:15:31,890
I think the reagents are the problem but

1657
01:15:30,449 --> 01:15:34,649
we have the scientific capacities we

1658
01:15:31,890 --> 01:15:36,030
have the technical capacities and it was

1659
01:15:34,649 --> 01:15:37,259
a matter of just trying to how do how do

1660
01:15:36,029 --> 01:15:39,269
we line this up and how do we get this

1661
01:15:37,260 --> 01:15:41,900
moved in a fashion that if we're dealing

1662
01:15:39,270 --> 01:15:43,710
with percentages of testing that if

1663
01:15:41,899 --> 01:15:45,239
theoretically needs to be done if you

1664
01:15:43,710 --> 01:15:46,949
follow the Harvard study it's somewhere

1665
01:15:45,239 --> 01:15:50,279
in between you know three to five

1666
01:15:46,949 --> 01:15:52,139
percent even more of the country would

1667
01:15:50,279 --> 01:15:53,939
have to be tested on a regular basis if

1668
01:15:52,140 --> 01:15:57,329
that's them if that's the modality of

1669
01:15:53,939 --> 01:16:00,269
controlled yet its control and the

1670
01:15:57,329 --> 01:16:01,920
pandemic nobody really has I I can't say

1671
01:16:00,270 --> 01:16:04,260
that everybody has the answer I know

1672
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:07,500
that some leaders are really you know

1673
01:16:04,260 --> 01:16:09,510
they're working really hard to to dig

1674
01:16:07,500 --> 01:16:11,699
deep and and you know put their liaisons

1675
01:16:09,510 --> 01:16:12,900
and trying to get these labs get them

1676
01:16:11,699 --> 01:16:13,470
whatever they need as quickly as

1677
01:16:12,899 --> 01:16:16,170
possible

1678
01:16:13,470 --> 01:16:17,820
city of La he's been you know City of LA

1679
01:16:16,170 --> 01:16:20,220
that's two weeks ago miorica said he

1680
01:16:17,819 --> 01:16:21,960
said anyone who needs a test can can get

1681
01:16:20,220 --> 01:16:24,869
a test it's not going to be defined by

1682
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:26,279
having symptom ology and so I think that

1683
01:16:24,869 --> 01:16:28,260
was a step in the right direction and

1684
01:16:26,279 --> 01:16:31,859
they're so so literally on the city the

1685
01:16:28,260 --> 01:16:33,659
county the state even the Fed

1686
01:16:31,859 --> 01:16:36,569
you know everybody's trying to work to

1687
01:16:33,659 --> 01:16:39,840
to get these labs active and and as well

1688
01:16:36,569 --> 01:16:43,170
as you know here's your billing code go

1689
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:46,650
to work I know there was a lab in Irvine

1690
01:16:43,170 --> 01:16:48,390
that that around California that was a

1691
01:16:46,649 --> 01:16:49,679
clean you know they were you know they

1692
01:16:48,390 --> 01:16:51,180
were originally from the cannabis

1693
01:16:49,680 --> 01:16:52,619
testing area so they had a kind of a

1694
01:16:51,180 --> 01:16:55,470
staff testing lab but they also had a

1695
01:16:52,619 --> 01:16:57,149
CLIA lab setup and they you know they

1696
01:16:55,470 --> 01:16:59,250
were breaking down walls and expanding

1697
01:16:57,149 --> 01:17:00,869
their CLIA capacity and CDC came in and

1698
01:16:59,250 --> 01:17:02,819
said you know you now you know you now

1699
01:17:00,869 --> 01:17:03,930
work for Uncle Sam we have a tremendous

1700
01:17:02,819 --> 01:17:05,819
amount of back load and they just

1701
01:17:03,930 --> 01:17:07,740
started throwing scent you know not

1702
01:17:05,819 --> 01:17:10,019
throwing but you know sending them

1703
01:17:07,739 --> 01:17:11,969
samples and you know now they you know

1704
01:17:10,020 --> 01:17:14,250
now they've been sort of activated so it

1705
01:17:11,970 --> 01:17:15,810
is you know it's boots on the ground and

1706
01:17:14,250 --> 01:17:18,689
I think any testing anyone who's working

1707
01:17:15,810 --> 01:17:19,950
in this environment is is a you know has

1708
01:17:18,689 --> 01:17:22,799
to be some boots on the ground some

1709
01:17:19,949 --> 01:17:24,750
potential partnership networking and and

1710
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:26,699
getting moving that you know if you

1711
01:17:24,750 --> 01:17:28,199
don't have the approvals you know don't

1712
01:17:26,699 --> 01:17:30,899
know they'll take me you know it's like

1713
01:17:28,199 --> 01:17:32,369
don't take no for an answer and kind of

1714
01:17:30,899 --> 01:17:33,839
kind of you know work it through through

1715
01:17:32,369 --> 01:17:35,840
it you know whatever you know whatever

1716
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:38,730
needs it was great that we had cannabis

1717
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:41,340
regulatory people that are you know

1718
01:17:38,729 --> 01:17:44,479
poring over CLIA you know right you know

1719
01:17:41,340 --> 01:17:48,029
this you've probably got through this

1720
01:17:44,479 --> 01:17:49,500
with like okay I've got this set of

1721
01:17:48,029 --> 01:17:51,000
regulations that I've got to deal with

1722
01:17:49,500 --> 01:17:52,829
this sets of regulations how do I put

1723
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:55,109
the two together and right now I think

1724
01:17:52,829 --> 01:17:57,090
Lori's Laurie Ajax I'm in California

1725
01:17:55,109 --> 01:17:59,369
since then like well you could do

1726
01:17:57,090 --> 01:18:01,110
either/or but I don't think they wanted

1727
01:17:59,369 --> 01:18:04,529
to co-mingle there was just maybe some

1728
01:18:01,109 --> 01:18:06,479
you know imaging you know some thoughts

1729
01:18:04,529 --> 01:18:09,479
of like how do you how do you do both

1730
01:18:06,479 --> 01:18:10,769
why you know it just me I don't know

1731
01:18:09,479 --> 01:18:12,149
whether there's an image or you know

1732
01:18:10,770 --> 01:18:15,450
they just we're still trying to get

1733
01:18:12,149 --> 01:18:17,039
their heads around it of you know what

1734
01:18:15,449 --> 01:18:19,769
what would it be like if a cannabis

1735
01:18:17,039 --> 01:18:21,420
testing lab were to engage in these more

1736
01:18:19,770 --> 01:18:23,160
advanced you know getting into high

1737
01:18:21,420 --> 01:18:24,930
complexity testing but you know the

1738
01:18:23,159 --> 01:18:26,430
staffs like you said you know the staffs

1739
01:18:24,930 --> 01:18:29,490
are there a lot of them people you know

1740
01:18:26,430 --> 01:18:32,130
a lot of folks came from CLIA so you

1741
01:18:29,489 --> 01:18:33,599
know it's not probably better equipment

1742
01:18:32,130 --> 01:18:35,310
I mean when you look at a lot of the

1743
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:37,260
clean labs they oftentimes get very

1744
01:18:35,310 --> 01:18:39,660
specialized and a few niche areas like

1745
01:18:37,260 --> 01:18:41,940
we had DNA sequencers and qpcr

1746
01:18:39,659 --> 01:18:44,039
instruments in our clia laboratory but

1747
01:18:41,939 --> 01:18:44,699
we didn't have mass PACs ICPs all these

1748
01:18:44,039 --> 01:18:45,960
are the tool

1749
01:18:44,699 --> 01:18:48,479
that might actually be very helpful

1750
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:49,590
studying kovat I mean yeah here you

1751
01:18:48,479 --> 01:18:51,509
people trying to pick some of these

1752
01:18:49,590 --> 01:18:53,940
things up with peptide scans I mean who

1753
01:18:51,510 --> 01:18:55,500
knows but though they'll create I was

1754
01:18:53,939 --> 01:18:56,819
really excited when I heard people were

1755
01:18:55,500 --> 01:18:58,619
trying to bring them in involved because

1756
01:18:56,819 --> 01:19:00,569
I liked the cannabis labs and that they

1757
01:18:58,619 --> 01:19:03,300
have such diversity of instrumentation

1758
01:19:00,569 --> 01:19:05,309
that they're likely to bring a couple

1759
01:19:03,300 --> 01:19:07,380
other innovative ideas into the picture

1760
01:19:05,310 --> 01:19:10,380
once they start get once they start

1761
01:19:07,380 --> 01:19:11,760
moving on this it does come to clear I

1762
01:19:10,380 --> 01:19:14,250
should put you in touch with them

1763
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:17,699
someone who works on can met here Doug

1764
01:19:14,250 --> 01:19:19,500
Kennedy is involved in LA doing testing

1765
01:19:17,699 --> 01:19:21,420
with Sean Penn they have some network

1766
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:23,520
out there that's doing like a dozen

1767
01:19:21,420 --> 01:19:25,199
tests a day and I don't know who they're

1768
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:26,880
they're channeling the actual work

1769
01:19:25,199 --> 01:19:29,819
through they're more on the set up the

1770
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:32,579
tents and parking lots and and get the

1771
01:19:29,819 --> 01:19:35,429
sample collection going but I think the

1772
01:19:32,579 --> 01:19:38,609
lab just set up a Dodger Stadium I

1773
01:19:35,430 --> 01:19:40,950
believe I have to use this time to tell

1774
01:19:38,609 --> 01:19:44,009
my anecdotal Los Angeles

1775
01:19:40,949 --> 01:19:47,399
testing story because its own tower I'm

1776
01:19:44,010 --> 01:19:48,989
sure everyone is is doing their best but

1777
01:19:47,399 --> 01:19:52,469
after the mayor announced that anyone

1778
01:19:48,989 --> 01:19:56,130
could get tested my wife called up and

1779
01:19:52,470 --> 01:19:59,340
made an appointment for her and my son

1780
01:19:56,130 --> 01:20:04,470
I didn't I decided not to do it to drive

1781
01:19:59,340 --> 01:20:06,840
down to Carson and get tested and which

1782
01:20:04,470 --> 01:20:09,840
is before from where we live over an

1783
01:20:06,840 --> 01:20:12,840
hour and they went they did it

1784
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:15,600
they were told 36 hours they would get

1785
01:20:12,840 --> 01:20:19,739
results it's maybe 10 days later nothing

1786
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:21,360
no soap no call no nothing obviously

1787
01:20:19,739 --> 01:20:24,960
whatever they were to tell us is

1788
01:20:21,359 --> 01:20:29,099
meaningless now I told her this morning

1789
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:31,199
I go you know I asked her every day you

1790
01:20:29,100 --> 01:20:33,510
know has anyone contact new doctors are

1791
01:20:31,199 --> 01:20:36,989
supposed to you know they say she did

1792
01:20:33,510 --> 01:20:38,220
contact me go we're behind and doctors

1793
01:20:36,989 --> 01:20:41,539
will be contacting you

1794
01:20:38,220 --> 01:20:46,460
no one has and I told her had it been me

1795
01:20:41,539 --> 01:20:49,500
I I'd be raising I do I'd be really

1796
01:20:46,460 --> 01:20:52,890
making a stink as all I can say because

1797
01:20:49,500 --> 01:20:54,840
it's you know in in in them trying to do

1798
01:20:52,890 --> 01:20:57,329
it in the most constructive way possible

1799
01:20:54,840 --> 01:20:58,500
because I know I don't believe it's a

1800
01:20:57,329 --> 01:21:00,960
conspiracy and I'm

1801
01:20:58,500 --> 01:21:04,319
I I believe everyone's trying their best

1802
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:08,279
but obviously the testing capacity the

1803
01:21:04,319 --> 01:21:10,170
lab capacity isn't there yeah yeah yeah

1804
01:21:08,279 --> 01:21:12,149
that's a--that's a good story and you

1805
01:21:10,170 --> 01:21:16,170
know the system is the system is

1806
01:21:12,149 --> 01:21:18,509
stressed and you got you know it's it's

1807
01:21:16,170 --> 01:21:19,920
and how do you know you want a bitch

1808
01:21:18,510 --> 01:21:23,960
normally you'd be able to bitch at

1809
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:23,960
somebody but now you can't know that I

1810
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:39,989
mean I I was quite you look at how

1811
01:21:38,039 --> 01:21:42,869
quickly this fired up in South Korea it

1812
01:21:39,989 --> 01:21:45,119
was a little bit embarrassing being in

1813
01:21:42,869 --> 01:21:46,260
the United States where PCR was invented

1814
01:21:45,119 --> 01:21:48,119
and we're here tripping over ourselves

1815
01:21:46,260 --> 01:21:49,980
trying to get this running it's not that

1816
01:21:48,119 --> 01:21:51,059
we don't know how to run PCR we don't

1817
01:21:49,979 --> 01:21:52,799
have enough of the storm of thermal

1818
01:21:51,060 --> 01:21:54,870
cyclers we don't have enough of the

1819
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:57,659
laboratory staff that are CLIA approved

1820
01:21:54,869 --> 01:21:59,069
is but right I mean they're uniquely a

1821
01:21:57,659 --> 01:22:00,930
setting you have to like submit your

1822
01:21:59,069 --> 01:22:02,069
resumes you can't have people on staff

1823
01:22:00,930 --> 01:22:04,230
that don't have less than certain

1824
01:22:02,069 --> 01:22:06,719
degrees and certainly those gotta have a

1825
01:22:04,229 --> 01:22:08,519
sign-off and every test I mean it

1826
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:10,770
creates a tremendous amount of

1827
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:13,350
infrastructure that does not respond in

1828
01:22:10,770 --> 01:22:17,070
pandemic timescales guys what's the

1829
01:22:13,350 --> 01:22:18,270
difference between being 17025 and CLIA

1830
01:22:17,069 --> 01:22:20,460
certified Oh

1831
01:22:18,270 --> 01:22:22,920
normos they're not even anymore I can

1832
01:22:20,460 --> 01:22:25,680
get a 17025 in a weekend I mean it's

1833
01:22:22,920 --> 01:22:27,480
it's really easy to do ISO 17025 maybe

1834
01:22:25,680 --> 01:22:29,880
not a weekend but you know we can work

1835
01:22:27,479 --> 01:22:31,979
right Leigha your team could spend six

1836
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:34,050
months getting all the books documented

1837
01:22:31,979 --> 01:22:35,879
your your lymph system proven your

1838
01:22:34,050 --> 01:22:38,579
people signed off I have we had to go

1839
01:22:35,880 --> 01:22:41,190
and get the the college transcripts for

1840
01:22:38,579 --> 01:22:45,289
our staff and some of the colleges were

1841
01:22:41,189 --> 01:22:45,289
like this dude graduate 30 years ago

1842
01:22:46,640 --> 01:22:59,869
it's it's like hard like nobody-nobody

1843
01:22:56,430 --> 01:23:06,030
that campus right now by hope University

1844
01:22:59,869 --> 01:23:08,519
try to dig up my diploma that's good you

1845
01:23:06,029 --> 01:23:10,439
know get your transcripts get your

1846
01:23:08,520 --> 01:23:13,670
diplomas get everything together you

1847
01:23:10,439 --> 01:23:13,669
never know what you might need it

1848
01:23:13,909 --> 01:23:20,189
hey Kevin while we have you here you can

1849
01:23:17,609 --> 01:23:22,170
you give us like a sort of a preview of

1850
01:23:20,189 --> 01:23:24,359
what we can expect to see and can med

1851
01:23:22,170 --> 01:23:26,940
and do you think some coded research

1852
01:23:24,359 --> 01:23:28,229
will make its way in I hope so we're

1853
01:23:26,939 --> 01:23:29,849
trying to pull in some of the folks that

1854
01:23:28,229 --> 01:23:31,259
were I should I should speak to the

1855
01:23:29,850 --> 01:23:33,480
folks that were just here and see if

1856
01:23:31,260 --> 01:23:36,119
they're interested in presenting I'll

1857
01:23:33,479 --> 01:23:37,349
try and hit them offline but we've

1858
01:23:36,119 --> 01:23:39,090
reached out to a lot of the folks that

1859
01:23:37,350 --> 01:23:42,270
have published work on cannabis and a

1860
01:23:39,090 --> 01:23:45,020
and IQ certain and there's been some

1861
01:23:42,270 --> 01:23:46,710
other work that's going on with people

1862
01:23:45,020 --> 01:23:49,380
demonstrating synthesis of these

1863
01:23:46,710 --> 01:23:50,970
cannabinoids and cell-free systems it's

1864
01:23:49,380 --> 01:23:53,369
very interesting to us so this is

1865
01:23:50,970 --> 01:23:55,770
getting the enzymes to express and fold

1866
01:23:53,369 --> 01:23:58,529
precursor without any cells so still

1867
01:23:55,770 --> 01:24:00,450
synthetic biology approach but it was

1868
01:23:58,529 --> 01:24:03,359
more like a PCR reaction that makes

1869
01:24:00,449 --> 01:24:05,729
these things as opposed to a getting

1870
01:24:03,359 --> 01:24:08,460
cells involved so there's a lot of

1871
01:24:05,729 --> 01:24:09,899
excitement in the field bringing we're

1872
01:24:08,460 --> 01:24:11,760
starting to see the genomics in the

1873
01:24:09,899 --> 01:24:13,199
synthetic biology really kick in and

1874
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:15,980
give us all these different tools to

1875
01:24:13,199 --> 01:24:19,349
play with we're doing some work on

1876
01:24:15,979 --> 01:24:20,849
detecting Cova Don on cannabis you know

1877
01:24:19,350 --> 01:24:22,710
that's that's not rocket science it's

1878
01:24:20,850 --> 01:24:25,860
pretty easy it's just adapting what we

1879
01:24:22,710 --> 01:24:27,270
do now to some different targets and

1880
01:24:25,859 --> 01:24:28,979
we're doing some work studying its

1881
01:24:27,270 --> 01:24:31,170
longevity how long does some words

1882
01:24:28,979 --> 01:24:33,750
sneeze on a plant does it sit around is

1883
01:24:31,170 --> 01:24:36,840
it degrade in a day it's RNAi right or

1884
01:24:33,750 --> 01:24:39,289
is it there for weeks and then we've

1885
01:24:36,840 --> 01:24:41,760
also been doing more work ourselves on

1886
01:24:39,289 --> 01:24:45,050
there's a can of assemble a thon we've

1887
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:47,909
going where some folks at the broad and

1888
01:24:45,050 --> 01:24:49,739
Sergey surgeon Koren who's built some

1889
01:24:47,909 --> 01:24:52,139
assemblers and PacBio and a few others

1890
01:24:49,739 --> 01:24:53,550
are all throwing their newest tools that

1891
01:24:52,140 --> 01:24:55,770
trying to reassemble the cannabis

1892
01:24:53,550 --> 01:24:57,180
genomes to make them better and we want

1893
01:24:55,770 --> 01:24:59,160
to get the telomeres nail than the

1894
01:24:57,180 --> 01:25:01,619
centromeres nailed and that requires a

1895
01:24:59,159 --> 01:25:03,930
lot more finishing work if you will in

1896
01:25:01,619 --> 01:25:05,039
the genome so some of that's getting

1897
01:25:03,930 --> 01:25:06,500
getting presented there I know I know

1898
01:25:05,039 --> 01:25:08,010
there's a panel out there on

1899
01:25:06,500 --> 01:25:10,350
Appalachians which is kind of

1900
01:25:08,010 --> 01:25:12,840
interesting to us the cat the California

1901
01:25:10,350 --> 01:25:15,360
collation system is starting to get some

1902
01:25:12,840 --> 01:25:16,920
traction and there's one on sort of

1903
01:25:15,359 --> 01:25:19,949
environmental impacts of growing

1904
01:25:16,920 --> 01:25:21,869
cannabis indoor and outdoor which has

1905
01:25:19,949 --> 01:25:23,369
always been interesting to me because I

1906
01:25:21,869 --> 01:25:25,619
think the price differential is now

1907
01:25:23,369 --> 01:25:29,309
almost 5x between indoor and outdoor can

1908
01:25:25,619 --> 01:25:30,779
this and all this putting it in door in

1909
01:25:29,310 --> 01:25:33,750
a prison to grow it is really not a

1910
01:25:30,779 --> 01:25:35,909
green environment I mean or consuming

1911
01:25:33,750 --> 01:25:39,060
shit loads of probably coal-fired energy

1912
01:25:35,909 --> 01:25:40,470
to grow cannabis inside of a prison so

1913
01:25:39,060 --> 01:25:42,840
we're hoping some of the rules and

1914
01:25:40,470 --> 01:25:45,030
regulations overtime will loosen up on

1915
01:25:42,840 --> 01:25:47,190
THC grows that we don't have to have

1916
01:25:45,029 --> 01:25:49,050
I've last I heard it was a couple

1917
01:25:47,189 --> 01:25:52,079
percentage of the entire energy grid in

1918
01:25:49,050 --> 01:25:53,789
Colorado is going to cannabis lights so

1919
01:25:52,079 --> 01:25:56,279
that's that seems to be you know not a

1920
01:25:53,789 --> 01:25:57,720
carbon friendly thing to do so there's

1921
01:25:56,279 --> 01:25:58,979
some of the carbon discussions there and

1922
01:25:57,720 --> 01:26:00,180
I think that's healthy because when you

1923
01:25:58,979 --> 01:26:02,609
when you look at love of the synthetic

1924
01:26:00,180 --> 01:26:05,970
biology we've got a plant right now

1925
01:26:02,609 --> 01:26:08,339
that's a carbon sink that that grows 20%

1926
01:26:05,970 --> 01:26:10,020
cannabinoids and then we've got yeast

1927
01:26:08,340 --> 01:26:11,520
which are a great model organism and a

1928
01:26:10,020 --> 01:26:13,740
great tool but we're feeding those

1929
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:17,040
things sugar and that sugar comes from

1930
01:26:13,739 --> 01:26:18,719
chloroplasts right and 99% of the sugar

1931
01:26:17,039 --> 01:26:21,359
in the world comes from photosynthesis

1932
01:26:18,720 --> 01:26:23,490
in the Calvin cycle in the yeast output

1933
01:26:21,359 --> 01:26:26,399
co2 so you know I haven't done all the

1934
01:26:23,489 --> 01:26:28,500
carbon credits on this thing but there's

1935
01:26:26,399 --> 01:26:30,569
an argument for some of these things

1936
01:26:28,500 --> 01:26:33,300
growing outdoors and being more

1937
01:26:30,569 --> 01:26:33,869
effective than brewing them but I think

1938
01:26:33,300 --> 01:26:35,250
some of the really interesting

1939
01:26:33,869 --> 01:26:37,140
cannabinoids are to come through the

1940
01:26:35,250 --> 01:26:39,329
yeast because you can you can isolate a

1941
01:26:37,140 --> 01:26:41,070
single gene and understand the circuitry

1942
01:26:39,329 --> 01:26:43,289
and get it to do what you want it to do

1943
01:26:41,069 --> 01:26:45,000
that's harder to do in cannabis that has

1944
01:26:43,289 --> 01:26:46,710
like 90 different cannabinoids in face

1945
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:48,989
genes some that are extinct some that

1946
01:26:46,710 --> 01:26:50,850
are still partially functional and it's

1947
01:26:48,989 --> 01:26:54,809
a more complex system to manipulate than

1948
01:26:50,850 --> 01:26:56,789
a yeast strains so yeah I'm just right

1949
01:26:54,810 --> 01:26:58,530
now we've been telling it's still on the

1950
01:26:56,789 --> 01:27:00,510
Pasadena Convention Center isn't gonna

1951
01:26:58,529 --> 01:27:02,609
hold back they're gonna space people and

1952
01:27:00,510 --> 01:27:03,750
have a bigger auditorium so people don't

1953
01:27:02,609 --> 01:27:04,380
feel like they've got to sit right next

1954
01:27:03,750 --> 01:27:06,359
to one another

1955
01:27:04,380 --> 01:27:07,590
hotels are another manner we're trying

1956
01:27:06,359 --> 01:27:10,380
to sort out the hotels some of the

1957
01:27:07,590 --> 01:27:13,460
hotels exactly is it again oh it's end

1958
01:27:10,380 --> 01:27:15,930
of September in Pasadena

1959
01:27:13,460 --> 01:27:18,260
so hopefully enough time for this to

1960
01:27:15,930 --> 01:27:18,260
blow over

1961
01:27:19,819 --> 01:27:29,159
yeah be great to have the the presenters

1962
01:27:22,829 --> 01:27:30,359
today I can med because yeah the intro I

1963
01:27:29,159 --> 01:27:31,470
remember reading the paper but didn't

1964
01:27:30,359 --> 01:27:32,729
have any personal connection with them

1965
01:27:31,470 --> 01:27:34,490
so I'll try to reach out and see if they

1966
01:27:32,729 --> 01:27:37,109
have they have the time and the interest

1967
01:27:34,489 --> 01:27:38,488
yeah I'll put everyone on a group email

1968
01:27:37,109 --> 01:27:43,439
but uh

1969
01:27:38,488 --> 01:27:45,678
one of the things Jamaican lion I see it

1970
01:27:43,439 --> 01:27:49,018
all the time and you're kind of like

1971
01:27:45,679 --> 01:27:51,480
what's the significance of Jamaican lion

1972
01:27:49,019 --> 01:27:53,099
like is it just the first one you did

1973
01:27:51,479 --> 01:27:55,049
something with and that's why you're

1974
01:27:53,099 --> 01:27:58,529
talking about it all the time or is its

1975
01:27:55,050 --> 01:28:00,538
unique in some way or and and where did

1976
01:27:58,529 --> 01:28:03,479
it come from because I have like Jeremy

1977
01:28:00,538 --> 01:28:05,029
Menard as the person I in my head know

1978
01:28:03,479 --> 01:28:07,589
[Music]

1979
01:28:05,029 --> 01:28:10,800
related to Jamaican light so what was

1980
01:28:07,590 --> 01:28:14,069
his role in all this and Doug can it

1981
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:28,498
Doug look at that Kennedy oh my god

1982

1986
01:28:44,309 --> 01:28:48,239
got some Sun yes not bad I don't know if

1987
01:28:46,859 --> 01:28:50,339
you heard but I'm working I'm not

1988
01:28:48,238 --> 01:28:53,729
working with I'm helping Sean Penn and

1989
01:28:50,340 --> 01:28:55,949
his Kobe dating sites are in LA Kevin

1990
01:28:53,729 --> 01:28:58,498
Kevin was saying that so yeah we should

1991
01:28:55,948 --> 01:29:00,268
we should get in touch I'm putting you

1992
01:28:58,498 --> 01:29:02,908
know we're working on that I'm working

1993
01:29:00,269 --> 01:29:05,369
on some of the testing aspects and you

1994
01:29:02,908 --> 01:29:06,689
know lining aligning patterns and and

1995
01:29:05,368 --> 01:29:09,058
I'm actually getting on the phone right

1996
01:29:06,689 --> 01:29:10,678
after I get off here with some with with

1997
01:29:09,059 --> 01:29:12,690
some testing companies that just got the

1998
01:29:10,679 --> 01:29:15,989
UAE's that are that want to collaborate

1999
01:29:12,689 --> 01:29:17,549
so yeah there's a way to if there's a

2000
01:29:15,988 --> 01:29:24,799
wait for us to work together be great

2001
01:29:17,550 --> 01:29:28,320
yeah go ahead what are you in Sean doing

2002
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:29,940
so Sean responded to the mayor's plead

2003
01:29:28,319 --> 01:29:30,719
for help with the coab in 19 testing

2004
01:29:29,939 --> 01:29:33,089
sites we need the fire department

2005
01:29:30,719 --> 01:29:36,420
leading them because the fire department

2006
01:29:33,090 --> 01:29:40,309
was overwhelmed so now we took over the

2007
01:29:36,420 --> 01:29:42,899
whole vision we have eight sites in LA

2008
01:29:40,309 --> 01:29:47,099
we have seven in Chicago a bunch of

2009
01:29:42,899 --> 01:29:50,248
Atlanta a bunch of New York Nashville we

2010
01:29:47,099 --> 01:29:51,819
have them in New Mexico key spots where

2011
01:29:50,248 --> 01:29:54,670
there's hotspots

2012
01:29:51,819 --> 01:29:58,808
Jack Dorsey from Twitter gave Shawn ten

2013
01:29:54,670 --> 01:30:01,179
million dollars to finance staff to work

2014
01:29:58,809 --> 01:30:03,699
on site before you know to be there with

2015
01:30:01,179 --> 01:30:05,440
the patients well their drive through

2016
01:30:03,698 --> 01:30:07,750
site so the patient takes takes to test

2017
01:30:05,439 --> 01:30:09,609
himself in the car when they drop it off

2018
01:30:07,750 --> 01:30:11,319
on their way out we're seeing a Dodger

2019
01:30:09,609 --> 01:30:13,658
Stadium we took that over two days ago

2020
01:30:11,319 --> 01:30:18,189
that site is seeing about six to seven

2021
01:30:13,658 --> 01:30:19,899
thousand patients a day damn good no the

2022
01:30:18,189 --> 01:30:22,118
whole thing is just to build data so

2023
01:30:19,899 --> 01:30:24,578
that way you know people in leadership

2024
01:30:22,118 --> 01:30:27,158
can make good decisions off of data you

2025
01:30:24,578 --> 01:30:31,149
know your data or are you doing

2026
01:30:27,158 --> 01:30:32,500
antibodies this is PCR data okay yeah

2027
01:30:31,149 --> 01:30:34,629
yeah they want to go into anybody's

2028
01:30:32,500 --> 01:30:38,469
naturally I was in talks with your

2029
01:30:34,630 --> 01:30:41,440
offense Kevin just yesterday they have

2030
01:30:38,469 --> 01:30:43,960
anybody tests koban making testing for

2031
01:30:41,439 --> 01:30:46,779
people for animals for surfaces for

2032
01:30:43,960 --> 01:30:48,250
water a whole bunch of stuff so they're

2033
01:30:46,779 --> 01:30:51,368
willing to get involved in what Shawn is

2034
01:30:48,250 --> 01:30:53,109
doing too well will soon have one for

2035
01:30:51,368 --> 01:30:55,779
testing it on cannabis I don't know how

2036
01:30:53,109 --> 01:30:57,639
meaningful is gonna be but they're they

2037
01:30:55,779 --> 01:31:00,788
are rarely finding this stuff in cats

2038
01:30:57,639 --> 01:31:02,739
and ferrets and dogs so you know it's

2039
01:31:00,788 --> 01:31:05,439
not you they're interested in finding it

2040
01:31:02,738 --> 01:31:07,509
in cannabis it won't be replicated in

2041
01:31:05,439 --> 01:31:09,669
cannabis if someone sneezes on it that's

2042
01:31:07,510 --> 01:31:13,090
the only way or bat guano might get it

2043
01:31:09,670 --> 01:31:15,158
there there's right on but but I think

2044
01:31:13,090 --> 01:31:18,429
we helping as a test could be beneficial

2045
01:31:15,158 --> 01:31:22,538
to you know your offenses desires 20 get

2046
01:31:18,429 --> 01:31:23,949
the ball that way yeah yeah more it's an

2047
01:31:22,538 --> 01:31:26,590
inhaled product that's what people are

2048
01:31:23,948 --> 01:31:28,359
worried about you know so if any were to

2049
01:31:26,590 --> 01:31:30,190
contaminated got it on there and then

2050
01:31:28,359 --> 01:31:32,049
you inhaled it and then oh patients or

2051
01:31:30,189 --> 01:31:35,109
comorbid with the same conditions that

2052
01:31:32,050 --> 01:31:39,239
Bogut seems to behead there's a remote

2053
01:31:35,109 --> 01:31:42,130
lightning strike event but it's it's a

2054
01:31:39,238 --> 01:31:43,328
it's more of an insurance policy we want

2055
01:31:42,130 --> 01:31:45,130
to be ready with it I mean the main

2056
01:31:43,328 --> 01:31:46,630
problem you have with COBIT is when it

2057
01:31:45,130 --> 01:31:48,849
hit the shore no one is ready with the

2058
01:31:46,630 --> 01:31:50,679
test right now whereas they were in the

2059
01:31:48,849 --> 01:31:52,300
other countries and so then took us 60

2060
01:31:50,679 --> 01:31:54,340
days to get all the tests out and we

2061
01:31:52,300 --> 01:31:55,960
don't want that six days to exist if

2062
01:31:54,340 --> 01:31:57,909
this ever gets found on cannabis we want

2063
01:31:55,960 --> 01:32:01,119
it on the Shelf there you go

2064
01:31:57,909 --> 01:32:05,800
yeah so Kevin you mentioned the bat

2065
01:32:01,119 --> 01:32:08,170
wanna were those domestic bats no those

2066
01:32:05,800 --> 01:32:11,380
that study was done like in China so oh

2067
01:32:08,170 --> 01:32:13,000
okay yeah I I've got no evidence of them

2068
01:32:11,380 --> 01:32:15,970
being found in u.s.

2069
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:19,000
bat guano but I mean these things these

2070
01:32:15,970 --> 01:32:20,829
cold viruses um the news is kind of spun

2071
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:22,810
this as some you know scary novel

2072
01:32:20,829 --> 01:32:24,519
viruses never been seen before and well

2073
01:32:22,810 --> 01:32:26,650
while the sequence is unique I don't

2074
01:32:24,520 --> 01:32:28,030
think it's immune epitope system is

2075
01:32:26,649 --> 01:32:31,869
unique I think we've seen enough

2076
01:32:28,029 --> 01:32:33,429
antibody data and enough enough number

2077
01:32:31,869 --> 01:32:35,289
of people that have been on ships and

2078
01:32:33,430 --> 01:32:37,210
have been on aircraft carriers where

2079
01:32:35,289 --> 01:32:39,159
those studies show that like 82 percent

2080
01:32:37,210 --> 01:32:40,659
of the people were clearly exposed

2081
01:32:39,159 --> 01:32:42,550
because they were contained in some of

2082
01:32:40,659 --> 01:32:44,889
the tightest quarters you can possibly

2083
01:32:42,550 --> 01:32:46,960
hold people and they didn't get the

2084
01:32:44,890 --> 01:32:49,000
disease and then pick up anything so

2085
01:32:46,960 --> 01:32:50,770
there's there's and there's a cell paper

2086
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:55,060
off for you guys that came out showing

2087
01:32:50,770 --> 01:32:56,620
that prior coronaviruses like hke one

2088
01:32:55,060 --> 01:33:00,400
and a couple of the other earlier Crona

2089
01:32:56,619 --> 01:33:02,649
viruses offer up cd4 and cd8 cells that

2090
01:33:00,399 --> 01:33:04,569
are responsive to Tsarskoe b2 so the

2091
01:33:02,649 --> 01:33:06,189
history of this thing's really important

2092
01:33:04,569 --> 01:33:08,139
the fact that it's been around before in

2093
01:33:06,189 --> 01:33:09,609
a different form in creating some

2094
01:33:08,140 --> 01:33:12,570
antibodies in the popular just probably

2095
01:33:09,609 --> 01:33:15,279
why the spread and the attenuation is

2096
01:33:12,569 --> 01:33:17,049
you know it or the spread has been

2097
01:33:15,279 --> 01:33:18,519
attenuated to some extent so I think

2098
01:33:17,050 --> 01:33:20,350
it's gonna be here again next year but

2099
01:33:18,520 --> 01:33:22,630
probably in a different flavor and and

2100
01:33:20,350 --> 01:33:24,520
slightly mutated and we'll have to adapt

2101
01:33:22,630 --> 01:33:26,170
to whatever it is that comes around next

2102
01:33:24,520 --> 01:33:27,760
season but this is what we deal with the

2103
01:33:26,170 --> 01:33:30,640
flu is every year you kind of have to

2104
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:32,770
refactor the vaccines the flu mutates a

2105
01:33:30,640 --> 01:33:36,460
little bit faster than this but it's

2106
01:33:32,770 --> 01:33:39,610
it's never a a single target you know

2107
01:33:36,460 --> 01:33:41,199
you end up having to run epidemiological

2108
01:33:39,609 --> 01:33:43,059
studies every year to find out what this

2109
01:33:41,199 --> 01:33:45,760
thing is turning into and then retarget

2110
01:33:43,060 --> 01:33:50,110
your your energies at the next seasonal

2111
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:51,610
version of this so yeah I would say I

2112
01:33:50,109 --> 01:33:52,989
would expect if you surveyed enough

2113
01:33:51,609 --> 01:33:54,549
stuff here in the United States I mean

2114
01:33:52,989 --> 01:33:56,619
if they're finding it bumping into

2115
01:33:54,550 --> 01:33:59,079
ferrets into cats and tigers and the

2116
01:33:56,619 --> 01:34:00,489
into it's going into pangolins it's

2117
01:33:59,079 --> 01:34:02,739
going into this they found it in some

2118
01:34:00,489 --> 01:34:04,239
dogs recently so this thing just wants a

2119
01:34:02,739 --> 01:34:06,159
stew receptors doesn't really care what

2120
01:34:04,239 --> 01:34:07,840
you are as long as you you're a mammal

2121
01:34:06,159 --> 01:34:09,729
it seems like it's gonna it's gonna grab

2122
01:34:07,840 --> 01:34:11,020
hold and replicate so I wouldn't be

2123
01:34:09,729 --> 01:34:11,349
surprised if we do find a different

2124
01:34:11,020 --> 01:34:13,810
server

2125
01:34:11,350 --> 01:34:16,000
it just may not be stars Kobe - I think

2126
01:34:13,810 --> 01:34:20,230
it's gonna be rat g13 or one of the

2127
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:22,930
earlier ones which means it was here

2128
01:34:20,229 --> 01:34:25,000
longer maybe well it's it's earlier

2129
01:34:22,930 --> 01:34:27,789
ancestors have probably come through yes

2130
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:29,859
I think SARS Kobe - the earliest

2131
01:34:27,789 --> 01:34:31,269
evidence we have is really in January I

2132
01:34:29,859 --> 01:34:33,609
mean those dates keep getting moved back

2133
01:34:31,270 --> 01:34:35,890
as they find some earlier versions of

2134
01:34:33,609 --> 01:34:38,529
them that hit Shore had the deeper they

2135
01:34:35,890 --> 01:34:40,510
dig but I'm even somewhat skeptical of

2136
01:34:38,529 --> 01:34:42,489
the December date in China being the

2137
01:34:40,510 --> 01:34:44,170
first time it was ever in humans I think

2138
01:34:42,489 --> 01:34:47,019
it's the first time we had a sequencer

2139
01:34:44,170 --> 01:34:48,730
near someone who was sick in China that

2140
01:34:47,020 --> 01:34:50,650
picked it up but I wouldn't be surprised

2141
01:34:48,729 --> 01:34:52,299
as people had it earlier and if they

2142
01:34:50,649 --> 01:34:54,849
just wrote it off as some other

2143
01:34:52,300 --> 01:34:57,579
respiratory virus and often when and no

2144
01:34:54,850 --> 01:34:59,110
one sequenced it I mean if you look at

2145
01:34:57,579 --> 01:35:01,210
that but they if you look at the the

2146
01:34:59,109 --> 01:35:03,670
phylogenetic locks on this the gap

2147
01:35:01,210 --> 01:35:06,369
between the bat which is called rat g13

2148
01:35:03,670 --> 01:35:09,789
and what we have circulating called SARS

2149
01:35:06,369 --> 01:35:12,489
Kobe - it's 40 to 70 years all right so

2150
01:35:09,789 --> 01:35:15,430
there's a lot of infamous ink missing

2151
01:35:12,489 --> 01:35:17,380
links that we don't have and we I'm

2152
01:35:15,430 --> 01:35:19,210
under the assumption that they exist we

2153
01:35:17,380 --> 01:35:20,829
just haven't sequenced them because all

2154
01:35:19,210 --> 01:35:24,010
things have ancestors unless you make

2155
01:35:20,829 --> 01:35:26,079
them in labs and so if this thing has

2156
01:35:24,010 --> 01:35:28,270
natural ancestors which I think a lot of

2157
01:35:26,079 --> 01:35:31,420
the penguin data shows it's likely

2158
01:35:28,270 --> 01:35:34,240
natural origin then there's a lot of

2159
01:35:31,420 --> 01:35:35,619
natural coronaviruses that have been out

2160
01:35:34,239 --> 01:35:37,210
there circulating that we haven't

2161
01:35:35,619 --> 01:35:38,769
bothered to sequence because they

2162
01:35:37,210 --> 01:35:40,989
probably were less symptomatic than this

2163
01:35:38,770 --> 01:35:43,690
one and they didn't you know register on

2164
01:35:40,989 --> 01:35:46,510
the epidemiology meters to go and in the

2165
01:35:43,689 --> 01:35:48,159
pandemic scale and start sequencing so I

2166
01:35:46,510 --> 01:35:49,750
think there's history and that means our

2167
01:35:48,159 --> 01:35:52,029
immune systems probably seen parts of

2168
01:35:49,750 --> 01:35:54,520
this before and there's more immunity

2169
01:35:52,029 --> 01:35:56,380
out there than we know and some of the

2170
01:35:54,520 --> 01:35:58,570
antibody tests are starting to show this

2171
01:35:56,380 --> 01:36:00,850
but the antibody tests they're really

2172
01:35:58,569 --> 01:36:03,939
specific to SARS Kobe to spike protein

2173
01:36:00,850 --> 01:36:05,829
or or the N proteins there they have to

2174
01:36:03,939 --> 01:36:07,689
be they design those tests with

2175
01:36:05,829 --> 01:36:10,170
exclusion criteria so they don't hit

2176
01:36:07,689 --> 01:36:12,909
MERS and they don't hit SARS SARS one

2177
01:36:10,170 --> 01:36:14,680
that that's interesting to track this

2178
01:36:12,909 --> 01:36:16,149
particular disease but it may give us an

2179
01:36:14,680 --> 01:36:17,560
under estimate of the people that are

2180
01:36:16,149 --> 01:36:19,479
going to be affected by this like as I

2181
01:36:17,560 --> 01:36:21,430
go back to work tool it may not it may

2182
01:36:19,479 --> 01:36:24,189
be conservative you may have people out

2183
01:36:21,430 --> 01:36:24,749
there that are immune to this because of

2184
01:36:24,189 --> 01:36:26,879
their

2185
01:36:24,748 --> 01:36:28,139
ancestral coronavirus exposure and we're

2186
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:29,969
never gonna see those with the carny

2187
01:36:28,139 --> 01:36:32,489
antibody tests no it makes it kind of

2188
01:36:29,969 --> 01:36:34,260
completely asymptomatic then yeah

2189
01:36:32,488 --> 01:36:35,728
exactly I think those people that are

2190
01:36:34,260 --> 01:36:37,860
asymptomatic there is another paper that

2191
01:36:35,729 --> 01:36:39,809
came out saying a good number of I think

2192
01:36:37,859 --> 01:36:42,238
was 33% of the people don't even

2193
01:36:39,809 --> 01:36:43,769
initiate antibody production off of

2194
01:36:42,238 --> 01:36:46,198
these things they're 1/8 immune system

2195
01:36:43,769 --> 01:36:47,670
clears it before they they trigger an

2196
01:36:46,198 --> 01:36:49,379
antibody response so there's some people

2197
01:36:47,670 --> 01:36:52,380
who just clear it without even at

2198
01:36:49,380 --> 01:36:54,118
getting any memory for it but there are

2199
01:36:52,380 --> 01:36:56,279
a lot of other they're asymptomatic that

2200
01:36:54,118 --> 01:36:57,658
have antibodies and let me get that cell

2201
01:36:56,279 --> 01:36:59,009
paper and pop it up here is really

2202
01:36:57,658 --> 01:37:00,719
interesting read but they demonstrated

2203
01:36:59,010 --> 01:37:02,909
that there's some ancestral piranha

2204
01:37:00,719 --> 01:37:05,399
viruses that are eliciting at least cd4

2205
01:37:02,908 --> 01:37:08,460
and cd8 cells that are across responsive

2206
01:37:05,399 --> 01:37:12,058
to Tsarskoe be too complicated

2207
01:37:08,460 --> 01:37:13,710
complicated space to fully test but the

2208
01:37:12,059 --> 01:37:15,389
testings needed Gator I think you have

2209
01:37:13,710 --> 01:37:16,649
that paper I had send it to you

2210
01:37:15,389 --> 01:37:21,300
yesterday

2211
01:37:16,649 --> 01:37:22,920
the biorhythms I should have and I

2212
01:37:21,300 --> 01:37:25,619
should have it a pretty on my fingertips

2213
01:37:22,920 --> 01:37:29,788
you're pretty pretty quickly it's a nice

2214
01:37:25,618 --> 01:37:32,069
reading so hey so Douglass well we got

2215
01:37:29,788 --> 01:37:36,238
you a questions just occurred to me any

2216
01:37:32,069 --> 01:37:39,420
plans to sort of upscale but the the

2217
01:37:36,238 --> 01:37:42,959
incredible tasking you guys are doing to

2218
01:37:39,420 --> 01:37:46,309
do then some tracing which will be

2219
01:37:42,960 --> 01:37:48,989
necessary isn't that a next step in the

2220
01:37:46,309 --> 01:37:50,670
yeah we're so we took the governor's

2221
01:37:48,988 --> 01:37:52,799
office three times a week about tracing

2222
01:37:50,670 --> 01:37:56,670
and other stuff and he wants to bring on

2223
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:58,170
20,000 people to do that so will

2224
01:37:56,670 --> 01:38:01,078
definitely be involved in that part

2225
01:37:58,170 --> 01:38:03,449
eventually the Cova 19 test will be so

2226
01:38:01,078 --> 01:38:05,069
needed you know as much as right now

2227
01:38:03,448 --> 01:38:07,529
with our different sites that we have up

2228
01:38:05,069 --> 01:38:09,029
so will condense our sites down and

2229
01:38:07,529 --> 01:38:11,670
we'll use our people that we have to

2230
01:38:09,029 --> 01:38:14,328
focus more on that if California asked

2231
01:38:11,670 --> 01:38:19,139
for 20,000 people to trace they get

2232
01:38:14,328 --> 01:38:22,018
120,000 yeah volunteering yeah for sure

2233
01:38:19,139 --> 01:38:23,519
we have salaries over people so with

2234
01:38:22,019 --> 01:38:25,619
Jack Dorsey's money and some other money

2235
01:38:23,519 --> 01:38:27,300
that's been coming through we're able to

2236
01:38:25,618 --> 01:38:29,098
fund people that are on the ground at

2237
01:38:27,300 --> 01:38:30,809
the sites and people that can be out and

2238
01:38:29,099 --> 01:38:33,179
about we have a team of volunteers that

2239
01:38:30,809 --> 01:38:35,130
help from home like myself um that just

2240
01:38:33,179 --> 01:38:36,868
kind of help here and there but the

2241
01:38:35,130 --> 01:38:37,949
staff the people that are hired the

2242
01:38:36,868 --> 01:38:40,539
staff are on full-time

2243
01:38:37,948 --> 01:38:46,988
we're about to talk about Jeanette

2244
01:38:40,539 --> 01:38:49,529
Jamaican Lion and uh and why why it's so

2245
01:38:46,988 --> 01:38:53,439
why were we using this train okay

2246
01:38:49,529 --> 01:38:55,509
there's a couple a couple reasons one we

2247
01:38:53,439 --> 01:38:57,849
wanted to type two plants the plant that

2248
01:38:55,510 --> 01:39:00,159
is both the CBD and the THC genetics

2249
01:38:57,850 --> 01:39:02,409
those those Llosa are very different in

2250
01:39:00,158 --> 01:39:06,279
the plants or usually like seven mega

2251
01:39:02,408 --> 01:39:07,299
bases apart and so a lot of the genomes

2252
01:39:06,279 --> 01:39:08,889
that we had done part of that we're

2253
01:39:07,300 --> 01:39:10,570
either all type ones are all type threes

2254
01:39:08,890 --> 01:39:11,860
and we never had a plant that be both so

2255
01:39:10,569 --> 01:39:14,529
we wanted to make sure we had a

2256
01:39:11,859 --> 01:39:15,849
reference that included those there were

2257
01:39:14,529 --> 01:39:17,170
some intellectual property stuff that

2258
01:39:15,850 --> 01:39:19,420
you guys have covered in the past that

2259
01:39:17,170 --> 01:39:22,260
it may play a role in some of the

2260
01:39:19,420 --> 01:39:25,630
biotech LLC patents were speaking toward

2261
01:39:22,260 --> 01:39:27,760
type 2 plants like this but that's for

2262
01:39:25,630 --> 01:39:30,369
lawyers to decide I'm not gauged enough

2263
01:39:27,760 --> 01:39:32,679
on that to know this is a type to plant

2264
01:39:30,369 --> 01:39:34,329
that Jeremy claims dated back prior to

2265
01:39:32,679 --> 01:39:37,029
the to the filing of those things but

2266
01:39:34,329 --> 01:39:38,229
that's a that's a long time ago and I

2267
01:39:37,029 --> 01:39:41,019
don't know if the audit trails are on

2268
01:39:38,229 --> 01:39:42,579
all that data so I the history of it I

2269
01:39:41,020 --> 01:39:45,640
actually picked this up with Martin Lee

2270
01:39:42,579 --> 01:39:50,380
out in he brought me up to our hot land

2271
01:39:45,640 --> 01:39:52,869
dispensary up in California and I pulled

2272
01:39:50,380 --> 01:39:56,020
down a few of those a few of those seeds

2273
01:39:52,869 --> 01:39:58,420
and like years later decided to pop them

2274
01:39:56,020 --> 01:39:59,830
and see what the hell they were and lo

2275
01:39:58,420 --> 01:40:00,640
and behold they're you know they're type

2276
01:39:59,829 --> 01:40:03,340
two plants

2277
01:40:00,640 --> 01:40:05,440
interesting plant he's claimed it's

2278
01:40:03,340 --> 01:40:07,270
powdery mildew resistant and I think we

2279
01:40:05,439 --> 01:40:08,799
agree I mean we've not ever seen the

2280
01:40:07,270 --> 01:40:12,190
plant get it

2281
01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:16,150
just to clarify he being Jeremy berry

2282
01:40:12,189 --> 01:40:19,389
yes yeah and can you talk about Jeremy

2283
01:40:16,149 --> 01:40:22,599
who is he what like after we published

2284
01:40:19,390 --> 01:40:24,820
this and we you know we identified that

2285
01:40:22,600 --> 01:40:27,130
you know we picked it up out of emerald

2286
01:40:24,819 --> 01:40:28,899
farms in holland the people there were

2287
01:40:27,130 --> 01:40:30,719
nice enough to connect me to him saying

2288
01:40:28,899 --> 01:40:35,829
he's the one who - who provided us with

2289
01:40:30,719 --> 01:40:37,119
the material and and so you know that's

2290
01:40:35,829 --> 01:40:38,529
that's where that kind of that

2291
01:40:37,119 --> 01:40:39,908
connection grew from he's the sense

2292
01:40:38,529 --> 01:40:42,969
given us a lot of data in terms of how

2293
01:40:39,908 --> 01:40:47,670
old it is and how you know long it dates

2294
01:40:42,969 --> 01:40:51,460
back it's a it's usually a two to one

2295
01:40:47,670 --> 01:40:53,440
CBD to THC line it sometimes makes beta

2296
01:40:51,460 --> 01:40:56,909
roughly dominant sometimes mercy and

2297
01:40:53,439 --> 01:40:59,710
it's not clear to us why and when so

2298
01:40:56,909 --> 01:41:02,979
that's you know the other complication

2299
01:40:59,710 --> 01:41:04,569
there but it does have some Kanab

2300
01:41:02,979 --> 01:41:05,799
acromion cassette which is really

2301
01:41:04,569 --> 01:41:07,420
interesting that's a two mega base

2302
01:41:05,800 --> 01:41:09,880
region in the plant a lot of other

2303
01:41:07,420 --> 01:41:11,529
plants were noticing or missing we

2304
01:41:09,880 --> 01:41:13,569
didn't know that going in we knew that

2305
01:41:11,529 --> 01:41:16,210
afterwards we found that in sequenced

2306
01:41:13,569 --> 01:41:17,859
another forty genomes we saw that oh god

2307
01:41:16,210 --> 01:41:19,630
this thing has a region that a lot of

2308
01:41:17,859 --> 01:41:21,279
these other ones are missing and it

2309
01:41:19,630 --> 01:41:24,699
might be very important figuring out

2310
01:41:21,279 --> 01:41:26,579
residual THC levels and hemp the the

2311
01:41:24,699 --> 01:41:27,699
three genes that are that are

2312
01:41:26,579 --> 01:41:29,979
predominantly

2313
01:41:27,699 --> 01:41:32,380
involved in cannabinoid synthesis

2314
01:41:29,979 --> 01:41:34,089
they're on people's radar and have high

2315
01:41:32,380 --> 01:41:36,279
sequence similar to one another or CBD

2316
01:41:34,090 --> 01:41:38,710
synthase PhDs in face and come out with

2317
01:41:36,279 --> 01:41:40,689
chromium synthase CBD synthase you can

2318
01:41:38,710 --> 01:41:43,390
put it in yeast will still make THC some

2319
01:41:40,689 --> 01:41:46,719
tea THC a a little bit of it probably a

2320
01:41:43,390 --> 01:41:48,850
20 to 1 ratio or so so a lot of people

2321
01:41:46,719 --> 01:41:50,439
are now growing CBG plants because that

2322
01:41:48,850 --> 01:41:53,079
then they don't even have that gene and

2323
01:41:50,439 --> 01:41:54,909
the tht genes gone the CBD genes gone

2324
01:41:53,079 --> 01:41:57,039
and they just make the precursor and

2325
01:41:54,909 --> 01:41:59,199
there's even still some THC coming

2326
01:41:57,039 --> 01:42:00,609
through we think that's coming through

2327
01:41:59,199 --> 01:42:01,988
with the cannabic chromium cassettes

2328
01:42:00,609 --> 01:42:04,869
that are in some of the plants that

2329
01:42:01,988 --> 01:42:07,750
those those genes end up synthesizing

2330
01:42:04,869 --> 01:42:09,159
small amounts of THC but that's a theory

2331
01:42:07,750 --> 01:42:10,439
it's not been proven yet but it seems to

2332
01:42:09,159 --> 01:42:13,930
line up with what we're seeing

2333
01:42:10,439 --> 01:42:15,939
genetically with a lot of customers so

2334
01:42:13,930 --> 01:42:18,280
we did this to build a really nice

2335
01:42:15,939 --> 01:42:20,889
reference basically and it's now been

2336
01:42:18,279 --> 01:42:23,139
used as a reference for the urethane

2337
01:42:20,890 --> 01:42:25,840
chips your offense building a 90 K snip

2338
01:42:23,140 --> 01:42:27,910
array with this thing they're now in

2339
01:42:25,840 --> 01:42:29,319
their earliest trials with that chip

2340
01:42:27,909 --> 01:42:32,859
it's chips in and they're running

2341
01:42:29,319 --> 01:42:34,349
samples and they're doing a study on

2342
01:42:32,859 --> 01:42:36,699
this with a couple growers in the field

2343
01:42:34,350 --> 01:42:38,380
we're also providing them with a cross

2344
01:42:36,699 --> 01:42:40,630
of Jamaican lion to something that's

2345
01:42:38,380 --> 01:42:42,940
powdery mildew susceptible so we can try

2346
01:42:40,630 --> 01:42:44,140
to track the resistance gene when it's

2347
01:42:42,939 --> 01:42:48,789
crossed into something that's not

2348
01:42:44,140 --> 01:42:50,890
resistant and see if we can if if we can

2349
01:42:48,789 --> 01:42:53,199
track those those those genes and into

2350
01:42:50,890 --> 01:42:54,940
other plants we put some of that in a

2351
01:42:53,199 --> 01:42:58,539
preprint now a link up here as well that

2352
01:42:54,939 --> 01:43:00,309
speaks to there's probably several

2353
01:42:58,539 --> 01:43:02,260
different ways for the plants have

2354
01:43:00,310 --> 01:43:03,490
evolved to become resistant to pathogens

2355
01:43:02,260 --> 01:43:05,350
without a doubt we've

2356
01:43:03,489 --> 01:43:07,119
looking at one here and one of the

2357
01:43:05,350 --> 01:43:09,789
mechanisms we're seeing in Jamaican Lyon

2358
01:43:07,119 --> 01:43:12,039
is a combination of a thamma teen like

2359
01:43:09,789 --> 01:43:14,769
protein and chitin ace that seems to be

2360
01:43:12,039 --> 01:43:16,539
can given it its resistance and we've

2361
01:43:14,770 --> 01:43:19,630
cloned those genes we've expressed them

2362
01:43:16,539 --> 01:43:21,760
in a coli we've now spiked those express

2363
01:43:19,630 --> 01:43:23,350
proteins into Aspergillus gross and

2364
01:43:21,760 --> 01:43:26,050
we've got we can demonstrate that those

2365
01:43:23,350 --> 01:43:31,270
cannabis proteins absolutely inhibit the

2366
01:43:26,050 --> 01:43:33,640
growth of Aspergillus in culture so just

2367
01:43:31,270 --> 01:43:37,660
to clarify if you put like Aspergillus

2368
01:43:33,640 --> 01:43:39,520
in a petri dish and you added this to it

2369
01:43:37,659 --> 01:43:42,250
it would it would not multiply

2370
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:44,500
exponentially it slows its growth on a

2371
01:43:42,250 --> 01:43:46,300
petri dish we've been doing it now in

2372
01:43:44,500 --> 01:43:48,100
liquid culture to try and mimic what

2373
01:43:46,300 --> 01:43:50,440
might happen with the foliar spray so

2374
01:43:48,100 --> 01:43:53,440
we'll put you know maybe twenty

2375
01:43:50,439 --> 01:43:56,199
Aspergillus spores and TSB and let it

2376
01:43:53,439 --> 01:43:58,779
grow for overnight with them without

2377
01:43:56,199 --> 01:44:01,599
these enzymes and the ones with with the

2378
01:43:58,779 --> 01:44:03,939
enzymes grow like sixty fourfold slower

2379
01:44:01,600 --> 01:44:05,410
than the ones without it so it's it's

2380
01:44:03,939 --> 01:44:07,119
doing something to slow the growth of

2381
01:44:05,409 --> 01:44:08,710
ask for jello so we need to repeat it on

2382
01:44:07,119 --> 01:44:10,899
Penicillium and Fusarium and a few

2383
01:44:08,710 --> 01:44:12,369
others but the petri dishes are another

2384
01:44:10,899 --> 01:44:14,529
way to do it they're just a little bit

2385
01:44:12,369 --> 01:44:16,149
less quantitative to measure than qPCR

2386
01:44:14,529 --> 01:44:19,630
you have to like take photographs and

2387
01:44:16,149 --> 01:44:20,829
imagine them not growing as well so

2388
01:44:19,630 --> 01:44:22,449
we're kind of digging into some of those

2389
01:44:20,829 --> 01:44:25,630
genetics and then I think you'll see

2390
01:44:22,449 --> 01:44:27,819
they had asked earlier dug some things

2391
01:44:25,630 --> 01:44:29,289
to expect a can med this year and I

2392
01:44:27,819 --> 01:44:30,909
threw out a few things that I remember

2393
01:44:29,289 --> 01:44:32,710
but I figured I'd you're a little bit

2394
01:44:30,909 --> 01:44:34,769
more in spent that than I am but will

2395
01:44:32,710 --> 01:44:37,539
probably be sharing some of this data on

2396
01:44:34,770 --> 01:44:41,110
on pathogen resistance in Jamaican Lyon

2397
01:44:37,539 --> 01:44:42,279
but I was mentioning that you guys had

2398
01:44:41,109 --> 01:44:46,239
some interesting panels I think on

2399
01:44:42,279 --> 01:44:48,210
environmental impact of growing and I

2400
01:44:46,239 --> 01:44:49,869
think there's a cultivation panel a

2401
01:44:48,210 --> 01:44:51,039
remember correctly it wasn't there

2402
01:44:49,869 --> 01:44:55,000
tissue culture that you guys were

2403
01:44:51,039 --> 01:44:56,430
hunting down that were sorry there's a

2404
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:58,329
few like that that we're finalizing now

2405
01:44:56,430 --> 01:45:00,310
and I guess they're going up from the

2406
01:44:58,329 --> 01:45:02,430
web in about a week with the description

2407
01:45:00,310 --> 01:45:04,810
for each one in who's presenting on them

2408
01:45:02,430 --> 01:45:09,369
information to all you guys before then

2409
01:45:04,810 --> 01:45:11,410
though all right all right yeah yeah

2410
01:45:09,369 --> 01:45:13,899
it's coming along we are finishing the

2411
01:45:11,409 --> 01:45:16,630
abstract process now but there's we're

2412
01:45:13,899 --> 01:45:17,170
leaving room for people coming in past

2413
01:45:16,630 --> 01:45:20,020
the deadline

2414
01:45:17,170 --> 01:45:22,539
that stuff of value right now we're

2415
01:45:20,020 --> 01:45:28,960
about 85 to 90 percent full on our

2416
01:45:22,539 --> 01:45:30,488
schedule Wow alright yeah this room and

2417
01:45:28,960 --> 01:45:33,310
just so you all know the mayor's office

2418
01:45:30,488 --> 01:45:34,959
I'm in touch with them all the time so

2419
01:45:33,310 --> 01:45:36,760
it's looking good for Ken meant to

2420
01:45:34,960 --> 01:45:38,198
happen with the guidelines that the

2421
01:45:36,760 --> 01:45:40,690
governor will put out for events like

2422
01:45:38,198 --> 01:45:42,909
this they're gonna allow events of up to

2423
01:45:40,689 --> 01:45:47,969
2,000 people starting right now as of
