2
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:17,800
Susan you want to take over with some

3
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:20,240
questions hi my name is Paul bregman and

4
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:22,760
I'm a physician Colorado consultant for

5
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:25,118
medicine women my question is as you

6
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:27,720
develop policy I think it's important to

7
00:00:25,118 --> 00:00:29,599
think about education mandating

8
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:32,359
education for the bud tenders and also

9
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:34,520
the f phes the cons the dispensaries

10
00:00:32,359 --> 00:00:36,238
because those are the and I just like to

11
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:38,320
get your impression about that because I

12
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:42,839
think that would go a long way to

13
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:46,198
furthering the Cannabis cause in the

14
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:50,079
communities anyone want to take that

15
00:00:46,198 --> 00:00:51,960
Janine hello okay uh I absolutely agree

16
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,960
I think one of the positive things about

17
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,439
regulating is the opportunity to do

18
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:59,759
education both with uh The Growers with

19
00:00:56,439 --> 00:01:02,320
the retail uh and with consumers and so

20
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:04,158
uh here in Long Beach what um we are

21
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,640
doing is we're making sure that these

22
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,280
jobs are also good jobs and we're

23
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,719
working with UFCW to do that and with

24
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,840
that I think comes a level of

25
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:14,798
professionalism where we can say here's

26
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,759
an opportunity to go through some uh

27
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:19,520
training some uh professional

28
00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:22,680
development with the doctors with the

29
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:24,199
Growers again with retail uh that this

30
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,680
is the opportunity about having it be

31
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:28,000
public because we get to talk publicly

32
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,280
about not only from a professional point

33
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,879
but from a consumer Point uh for many

34
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:34,799
years I volunteered at LAPD I was on the

35
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:37,199
board of directors of several

36
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,640
nonprofits and one day they came to us

37
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,920
with a proposal they wanted us to buy

38
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,599
them equipment to bust the Cannabis

39
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:46,040
Growers uh I voiced my strong opposition

40
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:48,039
and we had a long debate about it and I

41
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:49,399
said you know it it's legal now and they

42
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,920
said well it's legal to sell but it's

43
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:53,640
illegal to grow so my response was okay

44
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,920
you bust the local Growers now the drug

45
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,640
cartels are going to come in and they're

46
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:59,560
going to take up the market share the

47
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,960
demand isn't going to go away so and as

48
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:03,719
you know councilman carretes we we have

49
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:05,118
overcrowded prisons we have people going

50
00:02:03,718 --> 00:02:06,478
in for violent offenses and they're

51
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:08,878
getting out early because our prisons

52
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:10,359
are overcrowded now what they seem to be

53
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:13,318
doing is that they're following these

54
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:14,840
Growers on the way to the dispensaries

55
00:02:13,318 --> 00:02:17,199
uh and busting them for possession and

56
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:18,400
they get a felony record for something

57
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:20,238
that shouldn't be a felony and I'm

58
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,239
wondering how we can work with our local

59
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,599
law enforcement and kind of just uh curb

60
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:26,519
this I mean these people are coming to

61
00:02:24,598 --> 00:02:28,560
me because they have mold fungus yeast

62
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:30,599
algae you know and I'm trying to help

63
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,318
them make a pharmaceutical product but

64
00:02:30,598 --> 00:02:33,799
they're scared to come out with what

65
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:35,598
they're doing and they're scared to ask

66
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:38,080
for

67
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:40,799
help well I I think it's difficult in

68
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:43,360
Los Angeles because we have laws on the

69
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:47,519
books right now that make it illegal so

70
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:49,360
it's difficult as a council that hasn't

71
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,200
come up with any consensus on how to

72
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:55,920
change it to say hey stop enforcing I

73
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:58,280
mean if if it was my call personally uh

74
00:02:55,919 --> 00:03:01,039
we would do that but I'm one council

75
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:03,680
member in Los Angeles one council member

76
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:06,679
really can't do anything it has to be a

77
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,879
majority of the council and I just don't

78
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:11,760
think we're there yet I think our our

79
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:14,798
only real step is to try and do this as

80
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:17,598
quickly as we can and come up with a

81
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:20,080
process whereby it's legal to grow

82
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:23,238
within the city and it's legal to

83
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:26,519
transport within the city and we have

84
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:28,319
some control over how it's grown so we

85
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:30,400
don't have a lot of pesticide use and

86
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:33,518
all the all the right steps

87
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,680
and then just do it I think in between

88
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:38,120
um I'm not sure I have any other good

89
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,120
advice other than don't get

90
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:42,599
caught be

91
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:45,280
careful the uh ordinance that we gave

92
00:03:42,598 --> 00:03:48,119
the city in Los Angeles includes um

93
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,759
manufacturers uh Standalone cultivation

94
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:52,480
edible makers because we want to be

95
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:55,399
included in the umbrella that Mera

96
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:56,959
created we want those cultivators that

97
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:59,039
have been and edible makers and

98
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,719
manufacturer that are illegally

99
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:03,158
producing right now just because the way

100
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:04,840
the law is set up be able to uh step up

101
00:04:03,158 --> 00:04:06,959
to a permit so that they don't get

102
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,878
busted so hopefully they'll pay

103
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,959
attention and we'll do an ordinance that

104
00:04:08,878 --> 00:04:12,560
you know does all that for everybody yes

105
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,400
my name is Laura clavan and I'm an

106
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,439
attorney and my question is this

107
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,759
especially to Mr Taylor from the the

108
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:20,358
county of YOLO uh there's a are you

109
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:23,000
aware of the new case that just came

110
00:04:20,358 --> 00:04:26,638
down it came down August 16

111
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,240
2016 on the case of us mckintosh where

112
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:31,280
the Department of Justice is being

113
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:34,639
prohibited from process Prosecuting uh

114
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:37,799
entities cultivators dispensaries and

115
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:42,079
people who transport as long as they're

116
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:44,960
doing it within the uh legal permits and

117
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:47,198
legally uh it's TI to in Appropriations

118
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:50,439
bill by Congress that is supposed to end

119
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:52,560
September 30th 2016 but there's some

120
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:54,839
changes taking place that are going to

121
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,519
put a stop to some of those

122
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:59,799
rates I'm not aware of that case but I'm

123
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:01,599
excited to hear about it and the the

124
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,600
challenge in this case and I think many

125
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,000
others the example that I'm talking

126
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,720
about is that there was there's no

127
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,319
charge file there's no court proceeding

128
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:14,600
there's no due process and the property

129
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:17,478
of the of the farmer was confiscated and

130
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:19,840
the D so I it's a it really is is

131
00:05:17,478 --> 00:05:21,800
something if you all have suggestions

132
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:24,799
about how to deal with this kind

133
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:27,079
of it seems like Rogue law enforcement

134
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,840
activity to to me on the until I hear

135
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:30,199
something more that's the way I'm

136
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:32,359
thinking about it

137
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:34,478
so even even what you're talking about

138
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:37,400
we're not even talking prosecution I'm

139
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:39,639
here to I'm speaking about this because

140
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:42,478
I know that many of many of the people

141
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:45,079
involved in this in this industry in

142
00:05:42,478 --> 00:05:47,800
doing this work are very familiar with

143
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:50,000
this but you might not have heard uh

144
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:52,439
somebody from who's not a grower and not

145
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,959
a user and I don't have the story the

146
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:59,959
personal narratives that that many of

147
00:05:54,959 --> 00:06:02,000
you bring uh but it's shocking

148
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:03,318
I'm a grower from Northern California

149
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,439
and I just kind of wanted to put a

150
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:07,280
northern California tinge on this

151
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:09,319
because we have Central and Southern

152
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:11,959
California what I want to say is

153
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:14,120
marijuana law in oh excuse me cannabis

154
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:16,399
law that's a very important distinction

155
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:18,680
cannabis law in most of California is

156
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:20,879
based on nuisance law and if you're

157
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:23,000
familiar with nuisance law it's driven

158
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:24,719
by a complaint there is not a search

159
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,079
warrant that's needed it's only a

160
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,960
neighbor's complaint and you are never

161
00:06:27,079 --> 00:06:31,560
knowing who that complainer was likewise

162
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:33,560
you don't get a day in court you don't

163
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:35,439
get an appeal it can be cut down

164
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:37,759
immediately right in front of your eyes

165
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:39,800
and in addition to that they charge you

166
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:44,199

Dr Maria Teresa ferer

Rosen I was a pain specialist for 40

194
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:53,158
years at UCLA Medical Center I was a

195
00:07:50,598 --> 00:07:55,839
professor and I started the first pain

196
00:07:53,158 --> 00:08:00,120
center at UCLA way back in

197
00:07:55,839 --> 00:08:02,519
1974 I know I don't look that old um but

198
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:06,560
anyway some of you weren't born

199
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:11,120
yet however I followed W the what you

200
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:14,519
call the W guideline for uh treating

201
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:18,519
pain with opioids at the top and we

202
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:21,439
didn't have cannabinoid uh I retired 14

203
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:24,240
years ago happy traveling around and all

204
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:27,478
of a sudden about 6 months ago I started

205
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:30,280
reading about medical cannabinoids and I

206
00:08:27,478 --> 00:08:31,598
resurrected my license because I said I

207
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:34,759
need to help

208
00:08:31,598 --> 00:08:36,080
people because this is a gift from God

209
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:38,958
it's an

210
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:41,240
herb I would like to ask a question

211
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:43,478
please because I'm going to open my own

212
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:45,959
Clinic I'm deciding which county I'm

213
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:48,560
going to go to and it seems like each

214
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:52,239
county has their own different

215
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:54,639
ordinances ordinances that seem to be

216
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,799
different one County to another I'd like

217
00:08:54,639 --> 00:09:00,000
to start it in a friendly place that's

218
00:08:56,799 --> 00:09:02,078
not going to close me down okay that's

219
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,159
you Jackie is that a question to me who

220
00:09:02,078 --> 00:09:05,599
is regulating at the moment is that what

221
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:07,240
you want to know I have it all in my

222
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:10,040
head I'm obsessed I will talk to you

223
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:13,360
after this um I I I can certainly give

224
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:15,199
you my own advice my advice would be La

225
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,759
could be friendly but we're not there

226
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,800
yet so if you're thinking about going

227
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:21,600
into La I'd wait to see what our

228
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:23,439
regulations are that we implement but

229
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,720
it's actually what I want to close with

230
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,640
um you know I was talking to Amanda

231
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,600
Raymond before I got up here and she

232
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:30,000
gave me a really great quote she said

233
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:32,360
politicians have a feeling about

234
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,639
marijuana they know what that feeling is

235
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:37,839
what they don't have a feeling about is

236
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:40,159
us you you have to create these

237
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:42,959
relationships with these people I was

238
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:44,600
able to call YOLO um supervisor Don

239
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:46,719
sailor when I got the call about the

240
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:48,278
raid and write on the phone to get him

241
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,600
involved because I have that

242
00:09:48,278 --> 00:09:53,078
relationship you know um we cannot

243
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:54,839
expect our Regulators to make sensible

244
00:09:53,078 --> 00:09:57,439
regulations if they don't know what we

245
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:59,640
need and um it's really hard for these

246
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:02,640
people sitting up here to vote against

247
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:04,120
us if we have a relationship with them

248
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:06,958
we've communicated with them what our

249
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:08,480
needs are so um get involved in

250
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:10,078
progressing the conversation about

251
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,560
regulations with your local elected

252
00:10:10,078 --> 00:10:15,639
officials do not wait for anyone to do

253
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:18,759
that for you um and I'm going to close

254
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:20,439
with with my favorite uh quote and I I I

255
