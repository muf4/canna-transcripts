2
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:10,440
if I compare myself to other food

3
00:00:08,558 --> 00:00:13,239
companies that make food without the

4
00:00:10,439 --> 00:00:16,679
Cannabis component what's the difference

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:18,679
well I mean I I've been saying the only

6
00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:21,278
thing that's illegitimate about my

7
00:00:18,679 --> 00:00:23,679
business is the way that I'm treated

8
00:00:21,278 --> 00:00:25,559
because you know as we were talking

9
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:28,320
about

10
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:30,358
um you know creating the highest quality

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,558
product I can one of our first goals was

12
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:35,079
to produce it in a commercial kitchen

13
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:37,479
cuz back in 2008 it was pretty much

14
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:40,120
being made at home by someone stuck in

15
00:00:37,479 --> 00:00:42,119
their backpack delivered to the store

16
00:00:40,119 --> 00:00:44,320
you know coming out of a backpack in a

17
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:45,198
home kitchen and you know we wanted to

18
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,079
kind of

19
00:00:45,198 --> 00:00:50,679
elevate

20
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:53,600
um the expectations and the Norms of the

21
00:00:50,679 --> 00:00:55,600
industry so a key way to do that was to

22
00:00:53,600 --> 00:01:00,359
produce the products in a commercial

23
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:02,000
kitchen so you know we could we could uh

24
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:05,840
convey that they are made in the most

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,478
responsible Safe Way um issue with that

26
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,880
is LA County Health Department does not

27
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:13,959
allow cannabis to be infused into

28
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:15,679
products in a health inspected kitchen

29
00:01:13,959 --> 00:01:17,959
um by

30
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:21,560
law

31
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:24,039
um by definition of putting infusing

32
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:28,240
cannabis oils into food products you're

33
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:31,079
adulterating food and that's illegal so

34
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:35,679
I'm basically you know at this stage of

35
00:01:31,078 --> 00:01:35,679
the game I'm a professional food

36
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,799
adulterates that's going to change soon

37
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:44,919
and you

38
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:46,680
know technology and Society is always or

39
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:50,439
quite often you know a couple steps

40
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:52,680
ahead of of laws I mean if you look at

41
00:01:50,438 --> 00:01:54,078
what Airbnb is doing or what Uber is

42
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,159
doing these are companies that are

43
00:01:54,078 --> 00:01:59,399
breaking the law because they've created

44
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:01,640
a new technology or a new platform that

45
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:04,840
that just doesn't really uh isn't being

46
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:06,718
contemplated by local laws yet in San

47
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:09,800
Francisco county they also don't want

48
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:11,280
you using a health inspected kitchen a

49
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,800
commercial kitchen they don't want you

50
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,430
using a home kitchen either they have a

51
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,719
rule where they suggest you're using

52
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:22,719
[Music]

53
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:26,000
um uh some Kitchen in the Middle Ground

54
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:30,000
area like a a semi commmercial kitchen

55
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,680
at a retirement home or you know

56
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,239
something like that that's that's what

57
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:38,680
their I think that's what their uh local

58
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,120
Department of Health is suggesting but I

59
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:42,439
know companies up there are using

60
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:45,120
commercial kitchens as well got it but

61
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:46,878
but that they're always sort of they're

62
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,959
using commercial kitchens but they're

63
00:02:46,878 --> 00:02:51,598
always sort of looking over their

64
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:54,120
shoulder yes who would be the ones to

65
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:55,919
affect the policy changes to catch up

66
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:59,400
with where the industry wants to be or

67
00:02:55,919 --> 00:03:01,679
is well Howard Zin said that democracy

68
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:04,200
is not only a counting up of laws it's a

69
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:08,000
counting up of actions right so I mean

70
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:13,479
the way we affect change is by doing

71
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:16,158
what we do you know and and uh you know

72
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:18,280
popularizing or normalizing cannabis use

73
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:21,000
and that's what's happening so you know

74
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:25,479
we're we're furthering the discussion by

75
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:28,959
starting the discussion you know and

76
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:30,518
um you know the discussion is um

77
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,239
capturing the attention of a lot of

78
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:35,640
people right now so the laws are going

79
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:37,799
to change real short real quickly here

80
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:41,958
you know it's 2015 this is something

81
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:45,120
I've been dealing with since 2008 and

82
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:47,000
um you know there's assembly Bill 266

83
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,759
which is looking like it has a lot of

84
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,560
momentum and it's going to be passed um

85
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:55,399
by the legislature and signed by the

86
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:58,640
governor in September and this is July

87
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:00,920
August we're in August now so you know

88
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:04,119
that's next month and and tell me what

89
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:06,280
legislature legislation 266 is about it

90
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,959
basically says that um the Board of

91
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,759
Equalization will be in charge of

92
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:11,759
Licensing it says the department of

93
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:14,719
health will be in charge of testing and

94
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:17,238
food safety um you know manufactured

95
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:18,759
products infused product safety and it

96
00:04:17,238 --> 00:04:23,439
says that the the Department of

97
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:26,160
Agriculture will be um in charge of uh

98
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:28,478
you know the the agriculture component

99
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,720
overseeing you know safety and in

100
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:32,959
cannabis cultivation and do you think

101
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,919
those three organizations are currently

102
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:37,879
educated and equipped to take on those

103
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:39,198
responsibilities um if they're not

104
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:41,800
educated they're not equipped and

105
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,680
they're not educated yet um but they'll

106
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,918
be mandated to get educated and so

107
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,280
hopefully it happens quickly in the

108
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:50,918
cultivation side of things really what

109
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:53,000
needs to just happen is people need to

110
00:04:50,918 --> 00:04:55,839
you know stop viewing cannabis through a

111
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,720
stigmatized lens because agriculture is

112
00:04:55,839 --> 00:05:00,159
agriculture you know there's a lot of

113
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:03,400
suggestions that you know can can abis

114
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:05,080
be you know subject to a whole

115
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:09,159
different

116
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:11,680
um you know set of rules than any other

117
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:15,120
plant or food product that's grown you

118
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:17,400
know um Tomatoes any food product you

119
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,280
can think of you're given a license

120
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:22,758
based on the square footage or the size

121
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:25,038
of your of your farm and in the Cannabis

122
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:27,160
world they're still in this prohibition

123
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:29,519
mindset of wanting to do it based on a

124
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,199
plant count that's actually been you

125
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:33,198
know

126
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:35,600
changed we're no longer assembly Bill

127
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:38,199
266 no longer contemplates the size of

128
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,120
your grow by plant count but for a while

129
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:42,840
there it was and that's just because you

130
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:45,120
know federal law over 99 plants certain

131
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:47,279
mandatory minimums kick in and for

132
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:50,800
enforcement plant count is a really

133
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:54,198
simple easy way to to judge the size of

134
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:56,120
a grow but um you know they don't do

135
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:58,439
that agricultural enforcement is not

136
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:02,240
based on you know more or less than 99

137
00:05:58,439 --> 00:06:06,038
tomato plants so you know it's

138
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:08,639
just from the cultivation side of things

139
00:06:06,038 --> 00:06:12,800
it just needs to be viewed as just

140
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:15,759
another plant right

141
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,840
um with the manufacturing side of things

142
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:19,639
there's going to be a lot more of a

143
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:22,439
learning curve for the you know the

144
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:24,639
regulatory um oversight body they're

145
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:26,680
going to have to learn a little bit

146
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:29,598
about THC and a little bit about

147
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:33,160
chemistry and how you know thca is

148
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:34,680
carboxilate into THC and potency and the

149
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,280
different cannabinoids that are in the

150
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:39,280
plant and what they do and which ones

151
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:40,758
are psychoactive and which ones aren't

152
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:43,159
um they're going to have to learn about

153
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:46,919
you know viable testing methods versus

154
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:48,919
ones that don't work so well um there's

155
00:06:46,918 --> 00:06:50,269
going to be more of a learning curve for

156
00:06:48,918 --> 00:06:57,879
that

157
00:06:50,269 --> 00:06:57,879
