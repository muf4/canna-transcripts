1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:08,160
Delta time THC there's now a huge thread

2
00:00:05,269 --> 00:00:12,539
regarding that and don't live when we

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:20,820
had a fun little for it for take a

4
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:25,039
little for a layman's background so so

5
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:27,390
depending it specifically yeah

6
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:32,160
everybody's different and I'll all have

7
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:36,509
their own special ways of a festival but

8
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:39,000
depending on where or how the different

9
00:00:36,509 --> 00:00:41,218
pieces of the molecule are laid out you

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,250
you know the difference between THC

11
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:46,950
delta 9 and T and C a is th EA has a

12
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:51,710
carbolic acid molecule in its tail and

13
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:55,079
no boxer group carboxyl group and in

14
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:56,878
another thing there's Delta 88 C which

15
00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:00,719
has gotten really popular with the water

16
00:00:56,878 --> 00:01:03,358
clear trend and people would you know

17
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,609
they would throw a bunch of carbon and

18
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,560
some acids and stuff into their boiling

19
00:01:05,609 --> 00:01:09,868
flask and then they'd start distilling

20
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,439
it and it's coming out beautiful water

21
00:01:09,868 --> 00:01:13,739
clear

22
00:01:10,438 --> 00:01:16,399
they sent test results or they'd sent

23
00:01:13,739 --> 00:01:20,149
testing labs and then it's yeah like

24
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:22,920
very low percentage of Delta 9 THC

25
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:26,070
eventually we started they got standards

26
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:28,079
for Delta 88 C then started quantifying

27
00:01:26,069 --> 00:01:31,529
that there's more THC in us that there

28
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:36,359
is but then there's still a little

29
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:39,719
missing piece that like you'd see you

30
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:42,688
know 60 to 70 80 percent cannabinoids

31
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:48,060
and this water clear stuff that you know

32
00:01:42,688 --> 00:01:51,089
it's all cannabinoids and there's plenty

33
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:54,320
of isomers and stereo isomers of THC and

34
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:56,820
these are things that happen through

35
00:01:54,319 --> 00:02:00,059
different reaction their reactions that

36
00:01:56,819 --> 00:02:03,089
happen through heating and the presence

37
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:05,700
of acids and bases and given the

38
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:07,500
different environmental things or what

39
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,920
was sprayed on those so that that can

40
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,750
actually be a big indicator

41
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:15,619
what's happening into the reactions as

42
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:17,959
well so so good all that distillation

43
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:20,030
method we're like you put stuff in a pot

44
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:23,150
it boils at different temperatures and

45
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:25,129
all that well throw catalyst in that pot

46
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:26,870
that you don't know is there like you

47
00:02:25,129 --> 00:02:28,819
know people spray put sulfur on their

48
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:31,039
plants or people you know certain things

49
00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:33,859
get sprayed on plants and when you

50
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:37,389
concentrate that thing in a hot flask

51
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:39,380
under vacuum where fires and fire attack

52
00:02:37,389 --> 00:02:41,958
there's a whole bunch of ways you could

53
00:02:39,379 --> 00:02:45,349
do that but to go back to Delta 10 Delta

54
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:51,920
10 is simply an unknown type of THC that

55
00:02:45,349 --> 00:02:54,139
until recently was it is yes in

56
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:57,409
different income in different ways they

57
00:02:54,139 --> 00:03:04,789
affect all three of those can affect a

58
00:02:57,409 --> 00:03:07,459
single person completely different no

59
00:03:04,789 --> 00:03:09,579
they've been discovered but they're only

60
00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:13,189
being mass-produced

61
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:16,850
yeah they yeah macula vanilla and knows

62
00:03:13,189 --> 00:03:20,060
about him and he has and we are just now

63
00:03:16,849 --> 00:03:22,729
mass producing them because we have the

64
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:24,199
freedom of the market to start and start

65
00:03:22,729 --> 00:03:26,419
playing and then we also have the

66
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:29,149
competition in the market to try to make

67
00:03:26,419 --> 00:03:40,069
the clearest most beautiful looking oil

68
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:43,519
which you know well it used to be Delta

69
00:03:40,069 --> 00:03:45,199
8 th DW I mean I we can I know use I'm

70
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:46,069
saying historically historically when

71
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:49,129
they first started getting this

72
00:03:46,069 --> 00:03:51,109
perfectly clear bottle of oil

73
00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:56,719
it was Delta eight and they would do

74
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:58,549
this refluxing carbon acids and but but

75
00:03:56,719 --> 00:04:00,739
but yeah and that was it then they would

76
00:03:58,549 --> 00:04:03,110
use a catalyst in the flask that they

77
00:04:00,739 --> 00:04:05,810
were boiling in one we're talking about

78
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:07,890
people who appreciate the clarity that

79
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:09,659
clear net the secret

80
00:04:07,889 --> 00:04:10,889
is that the consumer is that an expert

81
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:13,259
consumers okay

82
00:04:10,889 --> 00:04:15,329
and what's your opinion on consumers

83
00:04:13,259 --> 00:04:18,689
have been led to believe that the clear

84
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:19,620
the oil is well and and and that clear

85
00:04:18,689 --> 00:04:21,420
could come from a lot of different

86
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:24,149
things it can be cut with another clear

87
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:27,330
oil that it makes you know just diffuses

88
00:04:24,149 --> 00:04:30,209
what color is in there there's a lot of

89
00:04:27,329 --> 00:04:32,399
things that can clarity is definitely an

90
00:04:30,209 --> 00:04:39,899
indicator of purity though it was an

91
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:44,069
indicator but the a slight yellow amber

92
00:04:39,899 --> 00:04:46,739
tint the these are little little atomic

93
00:04:44,069 --> 00:04:49,259
level refractions that are happening

94
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:51,540
with chromophores that hold into the the

95
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:54,860
tail end of the molecule these these are

96
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:59,910
what a chromophore is uncle mela

97
00:04:54,860 --> 00:05:03,120
these they're they're basically like

98
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:05,550
atomically small things that will

99
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:10,168
refract light at a different color so

100
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:13,620
you have so by breaking that bond you

101
00:05:10,168 --> 00:05:15,719
you like that's when people distill with

102
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:18,410
certain things on the flask you can

103
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:22,760
break that at that chromophore bond and

104
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:25,580
it you can also break that bond by

105
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:28,500
through chromatography as well which

106
00:05:25,579 --> 00:05:30,359
people eventually developed a method for

107
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:33,389
Delta 9 THC

108
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:37,139
does anyone clear water clear yeah

109
00:05:33,389 --> 00:05:39,029
and it that was just a method of taking

110
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:43,199
a single pass distillate and then

111
00:05:39,029 --> 00:05:46,978
passing it through a series of usually

112
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:51,860
magnesium silicate or floor so actually

113
00:05:46,978 --> 00:05:55,159
and then but different color remediating

114
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:58,319
adsorbents that were also being used to

115
00:05:55,160 --> 00:06:00,840
remediate past asides and they still are

116
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:06,240
used to remediate pesticides and it just

117
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:09,119
happened that you make water clear delta

118
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:11,699
9 after remediating pesticides properly

119
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,430
as sometimes depending on the oil and

120
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:17,599
what kind of colors and that

121
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:27,379
the condition THC 8 and 10 have been

122
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:30,259
known for and their-their prevalent in

123
00:06:27,379 --> 00:06:32,300
the same way that THC is in Canada like

124
00:06:30,259 --> 00:06:34,220
there is it kind of like a is it a

125
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:37,280
totally different cannabinoid that is in

126
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:39,289
very low percentages in well zombie

127
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:41,138
health of ours not so much on the

128
00:06:39,288 --> 00:06:43,279
cultivar it's a reaction through

129
00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:44,840
processing so you're not gonna have

130
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:47,719
those you're not gonna have a bunch of

131
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:50,089
Delta eight or delta10 any in your

132
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:59,660
flowers you're gonna have it in a kind

133
00:06:50,089 --> 00:07:03,829
of a crazy their isomers correct and it

134
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:06,169
was the one thing everything we're

135
00:07:03,829 --> 00:07:09,769
talking about is like the ability to

136
00:07:06,168 --> 00:07:15,258
narrow the bands of what you're

137
00:07:09,769 --> 00:07:18,198
capturing well if you cuz you're right

138
00:07:15,259 --> 00:07:19,879
it's it's these little slices but the

139
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:23,000
only way that's possible is that we've

140
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:25,610
now created these massive machine that

141
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,970
will process a lot so we get bigger

142
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:32,180
trends you know we we see information

143
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:34,639
come out of plant material from farms

144
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:36,288
all over California grown differently

145
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,870
going different ways different yields

146
00:07:36,288 --> 00:07:40,668
different strengths different compounds

147
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:42,918
or the makeup of the cannabinoids in

148
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:44,418
that specific strain like it's really

149
00:07:42,918 --> 00:07:46,969
interesting we get to see a lot of those

150
00:07:44,418 --> 00:07:48,649
so at the same time as we're narrowing

151
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:51,080
the focus and really like getting to

152
00:07:48,649 --> 00:07:53,029
chop down into you know now we're we

153
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:56,839
just picked up a machine that will

154
00:07:53,029 --> 00:07:59,319
separate out individual cannabinoids so

155
00:07:56,839 --> 00:08:02,119
you can collect them individually

156
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:06,259
it's a centrifugal partitioning

157
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:08,560
chromatography this company called rodeo

158
00:08:06,259 --> 00:08:08,560
cron

159
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:21,680
they catch it you guys okay yeah sorry

160
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:24,198
THC eight and ten are kind of like mine

161
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,970
or like other cannabinoids that we've

162
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:28,759
known about it but haven't been able to

163
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:32,658
isolate so on the market are we gonna

164
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:35,240
eventually see like THC eight tinctures

165
00:08:32,658 --> 00:08:36,439
and THC ten tinctures in the same way

166
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:38,538
that we see other kind of my hair

167
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:42,020
cannabinoid totally and we've been

168
00:08:38,538 --> 00:08:46,338
seeing mostly we've been seeing a lot of

169
00:08:42,019 --> 00:08:50,028
THC eight cart hay in cartridges and

170
00:08:46,339 --> 00:08:57,320
there is subsequently a decent amount of

171
00:08:50,028 --> 00:08:59,360
Delta ten THC that's in there well no

172
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:01,310
they're just calling it if you're buying

173
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,019
a card off the traditional market you

174
00:09:01,309 --> 00:09:04,489
they're saying it's one thing but who

175
00:09:03,019 --> 00:09:06,730
knows what really is in that cartridge

176
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:11,060
right so but because you can take

177
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:12,470
garbage oil and by attorney by doing

178
00:09:11,059 --> 00:09:14,719
this process to convert it to Delta

179
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:17,180
eight clean it up to make it look clear

180
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,910
a lot of guys do that ii buy a really

181
00:09:17,179 --> 00:09:21,588
cheap oil get a little bit of a fraction

182
00:09:19,909 --> 00:09:25,219
of that off and this really nice-looking

183
00:09:21,589 --> 00:09:28,970
oil and then it's just cheaper the way

184
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:31,160
that that's produced then I like water

185
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:33,740
clear Delta nine it takes extremely

186
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:37,870
expensive absorbance and a process to do

187
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:40,730
it with the Delta eight you throw some

188
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:42,889
activated carbon in their flask and if

189
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:46,339
you distill right here you can get water

190
00:09:42,889 --> 00:09:49,309
clear I mean there's a few other a few

191
00:09:46,339 --> 00:09:50,779
other parameters to change but you just

192
00:09:49,309 --> 00:09:52,699
dump a bunch of garbage in your flask

193
00:09:50,778 --> 00:09:55,129
and then just mix it with your oil and

194
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:57,379
your oil is coming out nicely that was

195
00:09:55,129 --> 00:10:00,470
what a bunch of people were doing to fix

196
00:09:57,379 --> 00:10:00,700
their dark oil especially in the early

197
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:03,100
day

198
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:05,520
when people really weren't distilling

199
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,519
very well
