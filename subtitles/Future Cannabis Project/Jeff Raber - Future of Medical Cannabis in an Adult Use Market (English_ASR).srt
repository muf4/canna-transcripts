2
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:24,118
how do we preserve true Medical in an

3
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,800
adult use Market it's a very big

4
00:00:24,118 --> 00:00:27,759
challenge I would say and there are some

5
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,439
that really want to be dedicated and are

6
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,560
passionate towards producing medical

7
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:33,480
products

8
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:35,079
um I think the standards of Purity for

9
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:36,759
both of those products today certainly

10
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:39,160
look to be the same which is a good

11
00:00:36,759 --> 00:00:41,000
thing everyone is entitled to good clean

12
00:00:39,159 --> 00:00:43,238
pure products so I don't think that that

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,679
you know bifurcating that in some way

14
00:00:43,238 --> 00:00:47,159
may make a little sense but it uh in my

15
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:49,479
opinion it's it's good to have clean

16
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:51,238
things for everybody um we shouldn't

17
00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:53,640
have a different type of Purity limits

18
00:00:51,238 --> 00:00:56,759
for all of our products out there I

19
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:59,359
think the medical minded operator might

20
00:00:56,759 --> 00:01:00,960
find it challenging to find shelf space

21
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,399
they might find it difficult to reach

22
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,200
all the patients that thereafter we may

23
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:08,640
see more of a delivery Network being set

24
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:11,040
up where you can have patients come into

25
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,439
a dispensary uh they may need to travel

26
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,159
further away we're not sure where all

27
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:17,438
the licensed dispensaries are going to

28
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:19,640
end up geographically speaking how many

29
00:01:17,438 --> 00:01:21,199
there might be Los Angeles is still

30
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:23,200
going through the process of creating

31
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,920
their new ordinance um they haven't

32
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,840
decided or discussed really if they're

33
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:29,599
going to have limitations or not I think

34
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,960
you're seeing a great resistance to

35
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:33,280
accept acting a large number of

36
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:35,759
dispensaries there's a lot of Southern

37
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,560
California locals that have said ban it

38
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,159
all we're going to wait to try and see

39
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,280
what this looks like before we start

40
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:43,000
permitting these things in any fashion

41
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,478
you have to be locally permitted before

42
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,799
you get a state permit so I think we're

43
00:01:45,478 --> 00:01:49,920
going to see this unfortunate time where

44
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:51,759
patients today are accessing things in

45
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,439
today's current Medical Market as that

46
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:56,159
one gets forced into the regulated one

47
00:01:54,438 --> 00:01:58,078
you'll see different operators show up

48
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,000
you'll see locations move you'll see

49
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:01,798
different product types show up and

50
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,959
today's patient that's finally found

51
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:04,840
what's working for them may

52
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:07,280
unfortunately be disconnected from that

53
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:09,159
product um and that's a huge Challenge

54
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,280
and not fair to any patient and I don't

55
00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:13,159
know if there's a great answer other

56
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,519
than you know try to make sure the

57
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:16,560
product that you're relying on the

58
00:02:14,519 --> 00:02:19,039
brands that you're relying on are moving

59
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,719
towards adopting the regulations are

60
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:22,799
finding some sort of way that they don't

61
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:25,719
get their supply disrupted in the new

62
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,599
system which is where do I manufacture

63
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:29,598
where do I have it distributed how do I

64
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:31,439
get distribution hooked up how do I make

65
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:33,518
sure I'm compliant with all the testing

66
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:35,479
how do I know that my product type is

67
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,719
actually compliant with the new

68
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:40,318
regulations um just a few things that

69
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:42,479
you have to deal with on top of you know

70
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:45,158
new business practices and other

71
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:47,318
problems the level of requirements for

72
00:02:45,158 --> 00:02:49,239
operating in this space based on

73
00:02:47,318 --> 00:02:52,399
manufacturing regulations are rather

74
00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:54,039
stringent they are extremely um detailed

75
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,680
you have to absolutely write every

76
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:58,199
single thing down um be redundant in

77
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,840
what you're adding to your batches so

78
00:02:58,199 --> 00:03:01,639
that someone's signing off on what some

79
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,360
some other operator actually added to it

80
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:05,919
and weighed out and the requirements for

81
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,840
that are I think unfortunately going to

82
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:10,238
push up the price a little bit when you

83
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:13,479
add tax when you add testing when you

84
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:15,560
add um things such as operating

85
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:17,919
conditions that require tons and tons of

86
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:20,759
paperwor and lots of diligence in that

87
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:22,719
regard it inherently adds cost more over

88
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:24,399
add to cities that are trying to tax on

89
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:26,878
top of it they're adding you know square

90
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,080
footage or gross receipt taxes on top of

91
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:30,598
that it's going to raise the cost and

92
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:32,480
today's Medical patients are not

93
00:03:30,598 --> 00:03:35,199
reimbursed by healthcare for their cost

94
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:37,000
of this medicine um we may see the

95
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:39,598
market balance that with people that say

96
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,479
I'll push down towards commodity pricing

97
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:43,359
I I know we all have to compete with the

98
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:45,158
black market pricing which are guys who

99
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,360
are not paying taxes or doing any of the

100
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:49,719
regular regulatory standards so there's

101
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,640
got to be a little bit of a give and

102
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:54,280
take but there's only so much that will

103
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:56,238
actually be able to be given um because

104
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:59,360
your costs of doing business are simply

105
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:01,360
going to go up to be able to comply um

106
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,319
how that whole piece of the pie

107
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:07,360
basically today gets split um between

108
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:09,639
taxes local taxes regulations and uh new

109
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,599
requirements for operating how much will

110
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:13,399
be left for the businesses that are

111
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:14,959
there I think the longer term minded

112
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,439
ones the ones that are going to invest

113
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:19,959
in the future are probably going to be a

114
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:22,399
lot better off um and able to weather

115
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:24,360
those storms and make it in a long sense

116
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:26,279
but are today's patients you know

117
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,639
acquiring medicine from people who are

118
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:30,679
operating in that fashion it very well

119
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,280
might be a no and it might be very

120
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,918
difficult for every patient to not be

121
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:36,559
disconnected from their medicine as

122
00:04:33,918 --> 00:04:39,120
regulations roll out I think there will

123
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,120
be a significant challenge in finding

124
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,240
new access points or the number of

125
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:46,000
access points the retail outlets um or

126
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,639
Delivery Systems that are going to be

127
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,120
set up from through the retail outlets

128
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:53,439
um to getting medicine into a patient's

129
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,959
hands today the the numbers of estimates

130
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:58,519
are hundreds to a thousand or more

131
00:04:55,959 --> 00:05:01,079
different dispensary points inside of

132
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:03,319
California um um and I think that number

133
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:05,758
is going to significantly shrink we

134
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:08,079
don't see many locals trying to rush to

135
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:10,439
permit uh a large number of dispensaries

136
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:11,959
if they're even willing to do one or two

137
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:13,399
uh and some are saying let's just keep

138
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:16,758
them all closed off and make them

139
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:19,198
delivery only um we will see those

140
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:20,919
distribution points Limited in number it

141
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,960
will be harder for patients to get

142
00:05:20,918 --> 00:05:24,879
access to their medicine I think one of

143
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:26,918
the only solutions around that will be

144
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:29,000
who's driving that and delivering it to

145
00:05:26,918 --> 00:05:31,439
them but again there will be increased

146
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,720
cost by having that happen um but I I

147
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:36,560
think it's definitely going to be a lot

148
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,560
less than what we see today

149
00:05:39,449 --> 00:05:42,550
