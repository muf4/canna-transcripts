1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,730
today is a topic du jour was you know

2
00:00:02,459 --> 00:00:08,519
around corporate governance and what can

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:10,530
be expected of of companies how they run

4
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:12,900
their companies how they treat their

5
00:00:10,529 --> 00:00:13,888
shareholders whether or not different

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,170
shareholders that are in different

7
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:18,750
classes that hold different paper you

8
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:19,920
know how they're treated how management

9
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:22,070
teams are thinking about their own

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,300
compensation how they're thinking about

11
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:26,339
the long-term viability of their

12
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,900
business versus you know are they

13
00:00:26,339 --> 00:00:30,420
short-term greedy or long-term greedy

14
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:32,609
and I think that what a lot of people

15
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:34,079
are watching right now is as some of

16
00:00:32,609 --> 00:00:35,488
these companies have these massive

17
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,429
market caps especially some of the

18
00:00:35,488 --> 00:00:40,109
multi-state operators you know are they

19
00:00:38,429 --> 00:00:41,700
gonna be around in five years or you

20
00:00:40,109 --> 00:00:43,979
know they're gonna be attacked by the

21
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,719
market eventually for for not practicing

22
00:00:43,979 --> 00:00:49,229
you know good corporate governance and

23
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:50,429
so you know what people are really what

24
00:00:49,229 --> 00:00:52,259
I heard a lot of people talking about

25
00:00:50,429 --> 00:00:53,308
today is what can we expect going

26
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:54,299
forward are these companies going to

27
00:00:53,308 --> 00:00:55,679
mature are they really ready for

28
00:00:54,299 --> 00:00:57,959
primetime did these companies go public

29
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:59,820
too early do they have the ability to

30
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,469
scale into being you know a fortune 500

31
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,628
style company are they going to end up

32
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:05,430
you know getting run into the ground and

33
00:01:03,628 --> 00:01:07,618
you know forgotten about in five years

34
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:08,850
time and you know I think about this in

35
00:01:07,618 --> 00:01:11,239
the same perspective of you know

36
00:01:08,849 --> 00:01:12,989
thinking about tech in the 1990s when

37
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:15,329
you know you're having this massive

38
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:17,688
valuations from like let's say 98 until

39
00:01:15,329 --> 00:01:19,798
2002 when it crashed

40
00:01:17,688 --> 00:01:21,000
you had companies that you thought were

41
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:22,020
gonna be the hottest big next thing

42
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,609
because they came out of the gate with

43
00:01:22,019 --> 00:01:25,438
so much bluster and bravado and then

44
00:01:23,609 --> 00:01:26,849
within two years time they burned

45
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:28,019
through all their cash you know

46
00:01:26,849 --> 00:01:29,839
squandered their first mover advantage

47
00:01:28,019 --> 00:01:31,890
and no one ever heard of them again

48
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,859
where some other ones took a really

49
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:36,239
meaningful example or meaningful

50
00:01:33,859 --> 00:01:38,930
approach to to how to address you know

51
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:41,849
their industry so you know you look at

52
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:44,100
1999 and you know Amazon obviously at

53
00:01:41,849 --> 00:01:45,359
the time was everyone knew the name but

54
00:01:44,099 --> 00:01:45,780
they weren't anything close to what they

55
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:47,459
are today

56
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,200
where's at the same time you had you

57
00:01:47,459 --> 00:01:51,359
know companies like you know MySpace

58
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,100
that probably could have made it that

59
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:54,390
that didn't and then those companies

60
00:01:53,099 --> 00:01:56,459
like pets.com there were the famous

61
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:58,649
flames and we're watching that happen

62
00:01:56,459 --> 00:02:00,328
right now with cannabis of which

63
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:02,820
companies do you look at and say okay

64
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:05,868
well that that company is run by so much

65
00:02:02,819 --> 00:02:07,769
corporate greed so much hubris that

66
00:02:05,868 --> 00:02:10,348
ultimately they're not they're not gonna

67
00:02:07,769 --> 00:02:11,310
be able to survive going forward whereas

68
00:02:10,348 --> 00:02:12,780
you're looking at some of the other ones

69
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:14,189
and thinking okay have the

70
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,629
been really really careful about how

71
00:02:14,189 --> 00:02:16,770
they structured their shares have they

72
00:02:15,629 --> 00:02:18,900
been really careful about how they've

73
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:20,370
treated their shareholders how they've

74
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:23,219
worked their cap table how they've you

75
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:24,959
know controlled their float you know so

76
00:02:23,219 --> 00:02:27,270
you look at a company like tilray that's

77
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,219
been really really smart about you know

78
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:30,030
not allowing all their shareholders from

79
00:02:29,219 --> 00:02:32,580
privateer

80
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:34,530
to have an exit you know to date where

81
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:36,540
you have some other companies where you

82
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:38,459
know they flooded the market with their

83
00:02:36,539 --> 00:02:39,840
paper and taking people off restrictions

84
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:41,459
too early that's gonna cause either

85
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,020
massive dilution or it's gonna cause a

86
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:44,879
massive downward pressure on their share

87
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:46,080
price and that's what people are

88
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:48,389
watching and and then they're also

89
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,510
watching who's at the helm and you know

90
00:02:48,389 --> 00:02:54,599
how are they thinking about it and are

91
00:02:51,509 --> 00:03:28,589
they are they being overly aggressive to

92
00:02:54,599 --> 00:03:30,120
the detriment of their shareholder yeah

93
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:33,840
I think it's a very real fear and I

94
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:35,129
think that what's happening what's

95
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,170
happening right now people are starting

96
00:03:35,129 --> 00:03:39,000
to you know the euphoria is wearing off

97
00:03:37,169 --> 00:03:41,219
you know you had this great saccharine

98
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,449
sugar high for a while like oh we've

99
00:03:41,219 --> 00:03:43,409
invested in this Kansas coming they're

100
00:03:42,449 --> 00:03:44,699
everywhere and they're gonna do all

101
00:03:43,409 --> 00:03:46,680
these great things and you know would

102
00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:48,689
look they've taken such a great

103
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:51,780
footprint right out of the gate that now

104
00:03:48,689 --> 00:03:53,099
is sort of the highest worn off and now

105
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,090
they're thinking about okay well you

106
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:55,919
know do these guys really know how to

107
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:57,120
run a business and you know now that

108
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:58,619
we've really read through all the

109
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,509
filings we've really read through you

110
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:03,659
know what what this company has you know

111
00:04:00,509 --> 00:04:05,399
underneath its not not what we thought

112
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:07,019
it was and then it's a question of

113
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,569
whether or not those companies are able

114
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:11,069
to to overcome that whether they can

115
00:04:09,569 --> 00:04:12,449
bring in you know good management behind

116
00:04:11,069 --> 00:04:14,009
that to say okay well we've got some

117
00:04:12,449 --> 00:04:15,149
we've got some issues we've got some

118
00:04:14,009 --> 00:04:17,430
overhangs we're gonna find a way to

119
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:19,168
clean it up or do you have management

120
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:20,608
teams that are still so confident in

121
00:04:19,168 --> 00:04:22,199
themselves that they think you know

122
00:04:20,608 --> 00:04:23,879
they're impenetrable but I think those

123
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:26,370
guys you're gonna watch a couple just

124
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:27,959
gets slaughtered because you

125
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:29,370
the short sellers are gonna come in or

126
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:31,109
you're gonna have derivative suits you

127
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:33,780
know throwing up the companies for for

128
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:35,669
mismanagement of funds or for for you

129
00:04:33,779 --> 00:04:36,929
know breach of fiduciary duty or you

130
00:04:35,668 --> 00:04:39,389
know doing things that from a corporate

131
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:41,340
governance standpoint will be looked

132
00:04:39,389 --> 00:04:43,319
upon very very unfavorably by any you

133
00:04:41,339 --> 00:04:46,019
know Court that's uh that's examining it

134
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:48,509
so you know expect to see the first wave

135
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:50,069
of like mega lawsuits happening you know

136
00:04:48,509 --> 00:04:52,050
in the immediate future and I think that

137
00:04:50,069 --> 00:04:53,339
you're gonna see some pretty big marquee

138
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:56,280
names that you know people were talking

139
00:04:53,339 --> 00:04:58,829
about all the time you know call it in

140
00:04:56,279 --> 00:05:02,429
the last three or four months probably

141
00:04:58,829 --> 00:05:03,959
not exist by 2020 and or if they do

142
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:06,449
exist they'll be you know a shadow of

143
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:08,129
their former selves right and we've seen

144
00:05:06,449 --> 00:05:10,110
some of these lawsuits alight pretty

145
00:05:08,129 --> 00:05:12,600
recently so a lot of these companies

146
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:16,379
have gone public so recently so if

147
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:19,410
you're thinking about the sentiment of

148
00:05:16,379 --> 00:05:22,379
early and current investors based on

149
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:25,650
what they do when a lock-up period ends

150
00:05:22,379 --> 00:05:29,009
what would you be watching for when

151
00:05:25,649 --> 00:05:30,959
company aids lockup period ends and

152
00:05:29,009 --> 00:05:32,399
they're a public company and you're what

153
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:36,120
you're watching or monitoring either

154
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:40,379
management or early investor activity in

155
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:43,800
terms of selling shares and on the

156
00:05:40,379 --> 00:05:46,709
Canadian exchanges on everybody's

157
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:47,788
favorite Canadian exchange the first

158
00:05:46,709 --> 00:05:49,379
thing to be watching for is you know

159
00:05:47,788 --> 00:05:51,750
who's their banker you know who they

160
00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:53,339
working with and what's that bankers

161
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:55,168
plan whether it's you know Canaccord or

162
00:05:53,339 --> 00:05:56,839
GMP or beacon or the other Canadian

163
00:05:55,168 --> 00:05:59,250
companies up there that are really

164
00:05:56,839 --> 00:06:00,509
supporting these companies and finding

165
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:02,098
out from management you know what's your

166
00:06:00,509 --> 00:06:03,870
what's your plan that when shares come

167
00:06:02,098 --> 00:06:05,129
off restriction to have a secondary

168
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:07,500
market that's gonna come in there and

169
00:06:05,129 --> 00:06:09,990
sweep up and purchase those shares so it

170
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:11,550
doesn't have just a massive hit to the

171
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:14,098
share price because some of these

172
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:15,900
companies you might have you know 10 20

173
00:06:14,098 --> 00:06:17,699
30 million shares or more hitting the

174
00:06:15,899 --> 00:06:20,399
market at one time this they come off

175
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:21,509
restrictions and boom some people are

176
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:23,189
gonna hold but there's a lot of people

177
00:06:21,509 --> 00:06:24,810
that say hey you know I got in really

178
00:06:23,189 --> 00:06:26,009
early I've already had a 20x I don't

179
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:28,079
want to risk that this thing goes down

180
00:06:26,009 --> 00:06:29,430
I'm gonna take my profits and walk away

181
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:31,620
and by the way I want to be first to the

182
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:32,879
door because if I wait someone else is

183
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:34,319
gonna beat me to it and that's gonna put

184
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:36,180
downward pressure on the on the share

185
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:39,209
price and it's gonna keep you know

186
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:40,168
pushing it down so you know when these

187
00:06:39,209 --> 00:06:42,180
shares do come offers

188
00:06:40,168 --> 00:06:43,228
if you're a really smart management team

189
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:45,090
and you've got really good strong

190
00:06:43,228 --> 00:06:46,348
relationships with your bankers you've

191
00:06:45,089 --> 00:06:47,369
already thought about this beforehand

192
00:06:46,348 --> 00:06:48,810
you're saying okay who's gonna go in

193
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:50,819
there and start buying large blocks to

194
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:51,778
support the share price or how much cash

195
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:54,509
we have on our balance sheet to

196
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:57,778
potentially buy shares back ourselves to

197
00:06:54,509 --> 00:06:59,278
keep them at the the share price up but

198
00:06:57,778 --> 00:07:02,098
you know watching these things hit too

199
00:06:59,278 --> 00:07:03,300
fast in crater is it's problematic and I

200
00:07:02,098 --> 00:07:06,110
think that a lot of times you have to

201
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:08,520
think about whether or not you're gonna

202
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:10,710
only allow a certain amounts of shares

203
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:13,318
from shareholders to bleed out in small

204
00:07:10,709 --> 00:07:16,908
tranches specifically to prevent that

205
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:16,908
from happening before before it does

206
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:24,088
