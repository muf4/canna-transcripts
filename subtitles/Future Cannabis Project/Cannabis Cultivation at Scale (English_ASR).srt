2
00:00:19,489 --> 00:00:24,899
how does that affect reaching the result

3
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:26,899
of a harvest most common tripping points

4
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:29,428
that everybody seems to be experiencing

5
00:00:26,899 --> 00:00:30,778
come from the same root cause I think

6
00:00:29,428 --> 00:00:33,539
everybody's trying to get to the end

7
00:00:30,778 --> 00:00:35,429
result fast without establishing the

8
00:00:33,539 --> 00:00:39,210
proper infrastructure or knowledge base

9
00:00:35,429 --> 00:00:41,369
or mechanisms for analyzing the process

10
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:42,870
and we have investors that are near the

11
00:00:41,369 --> 00:00:43,409
industry that want widgets and they want

12
00:00:42,869 --> 00:00:45,689
them now

13
00:00:43,409 --> 00:00:48,238
and so growers are altering their style

14
00:00:45,689 --> 00:00:51,000
they're watering multiple times through

15
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:52,919
the day to try and feed the plants push

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,230
them and coupled with a bad greenhouse

17
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:57,660
environment that leads to pests and

18
00:00:55,229 --> 00:00:59,279
disease pressure and so there's

19
00:00:57,659 --> 00:01:00,839
different ways is that manifest but

20
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,280
that's like the main thing we got a

21
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,329
whole bunch of carts in front of horses

22
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,879
and we just need to like look at the

23
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:09,810
horses for ten minutes we need a little

24
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:11,489
bit more open dialogue between the

25
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:12,960
people that actually have growing

26
00:01:11,489 --> 00:01:14,938
experience and the people paying for the

27
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:17,099
building it's remarkable how many people

28
00:01:14,938 --> 00:01:19,500
buy a greenhouse with an investor and

29
00:01:17,099 --> 00:01:21,118
another guy and nobody that cultivates

30
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,359
is involved in that conversation which

31
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:25,950
is mind blowing and so a bunch of

32
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:30,259
facility configurations are chosen and

33
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:32,820
those do not lead to plant health and

34
00:01:30,259 --> 00:01:35,579
vigorous harvest it leads to resorting

35
00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:38,758
to chemicals and failing tests and

36
00:01:35,578 --> 00:01:41,188
having crop loss so what is the cost to

37
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:42,269
the operation of you know trying to cram

38
00:01:41,188 --> 00:01:44,188
this thing into the hole before

39
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:48,509
everybody loses their opportunity to

40
00:01:44,188 --> 00:01:49,679
find gold and how that manifests with

41
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:55,049
the customers that I work with and

42
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:57,270
living soils is we have a lot of people

43
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:59,280
that are moving from old technologies

44
00:01:57,269 --> 00:02:02,099
hydroponics the nutrient quantity

45
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,599
mindset and they go they you have to use

46
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:05,459
a certain quantity of nutrients to get a

47
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:06,688
certain plant result and that's the only

48
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:08,939
way we need to know how to

49
00:02:06,688 --> 00:02:10,859
get a harvest and so we're just pushing

50
00:02:08,939 --> 00:02:14,098
on that same thing so when we move from

51
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:15,989
that old nutrient quantity techniques to

52
00:02:14,098 --> 00:02:18,629
a living soil which is a nutrient

53
00:02:15,989 --> 00:02:20,459
availability system and we're relying on

54
00:02:18,629 --> 00:02:24,329
nutrients to be produced and available

55
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:25,650
when we increase the quantity we slow

56
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:29,519
that system down and becomes problematic

57
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:34,349
so pushing water pushing feed all leads

58
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:36,450
to crop loss question essentially is how

59
00:02:34,348 --> 00:02:38,518
does the different techniques processes

60
00:02:36,449 --> 00:02:41,329
and practices we're doing negatively

61
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:43,620
affect us at the regulated scale

62
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:45,719
techniques that we used to do on a small

63
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:47,670
scale we're manageable and when we're

64
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:50,430
inside of a smaller space we can manage

65
00:02:47,669 --> 00:02:51,929
the pests and disease that's manifested

66
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:53,939
from the techniques and processes we're

67
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:56,670
doing and when we move up into these

68
00:02:53,939 --> 00:02:58,500
larger just like Jonathan said I mean

69
00:02:56,669 --> 00:03:02,389
we're talking acre properties now life

70
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:04,709
you cannot have highly-trained hands-on

71
00:03:02,389 --> 00:03:05,969
skill looking at all those plants and

72
00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:08,549
dealing with things in the way that we

73
00:03:05,969 --> 00:03:11,759
did before the techniques and processes

74
00:03:08,549 --> 00:03:13,200
and things that we've created an

75
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:15,000
emotional attachment to it the smaller

76
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:19,409
scale when we move to the higher

77
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,879
regulated process those techniques are

78
00:03:19,409 --> 00:03:22,979
actually the source of our problem and

79
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:25,560
that's the biggest most difficult thing

80
00:03:22,979 --> 00:03:27,388
to communicate to these growers is that

81
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:29,400
this three-day tea brew that they're

82
00:03:27,389 --> 00:03:31,560
making and high-altitude is literally

83
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,750
and mathematically the cause for the

84
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,009
rest of mites and when you suggest that

85
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:37,019
to people they take it as a personal

86
00:03:35,009 --> 00:03:39,568
attack against internet heroes and

87
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:41,069
personalities and their religion and it

88
00:03:39,568 --> 00:03:43,129
gets really deep but like this is just

89
00:03:41,068 --> 00:03:46,349
math here and we can open up a

90
00:03:43,129 --> 00:03:48,449
first-year freshman biology textbook and

91
00:03:46,349 --> 00:03:50,459
we can identify these organisms and we

92
00:03:48,449 --> 00:03:52,409
can we can do this ourselves you don't

93
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:53,609
have to take my word for it you can

94
00:03:52,409 --> 00:03:55,650
learn to use a microscope and you can

95
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:57,900
see what this is happening but the

96
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:59,760
techniques that we use that the smaller

97
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,079
scale are literally the cause for

98
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:03,149
failure at the regulated scale because

99
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:04,920
now we have somebody that is using

100
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:07,139
scientific methods for analyzing your

101
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:08,548
process and they are finding Listeria

102
00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:11,069
and they're finding e.coli and they are

103
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:13,319
finding these disease-causing organisms

104
00:04:11,068 --> 00:04:15,149
that fail a test and and if we can

105
00:04:13,318 --> 00:04:18,180
understand that conditions create

106
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:19,790
biological organism proliferation and we

107
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:22,759
can understand that the condition

108
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:25,370
these are creating the those organisms

109
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:29,569
to grow we can avoid that test failure

110
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:31,340
and most common problem is somebody

111
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:33,230
doing a tea brew that's actually brewing

112
00:04:31,339 --> 00:04:34,729
disease-causing organisms you spread

113
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:36,470
that throughout your facility and you

114
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:37,879
have pest and disease pressure and the

115
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:39,650
problem is a communities we don't have

116
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:41,689
much reference for this and we're just

117
00:04:39,649 --> 00:04:43,189
barely getting a reference for it

118
00:04:41,689 --> 00:04:45,589
the information has been around for

119
00:04:43,189 --> 00:04:47,449
decades but it's now starting to pick up

120
00:04:45,589 --> 00:04:48,769
in the cannabis industry with the

121
00:04:47,449 --> 00:04:51,050
growers that are trying to find more

122
00:04:48,769 --> 00:04:52,399
responsible ways to farm and so we're

123
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:54,170
just barely in the last year or two

124
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:56,089
starting to get like a community

125
00:04:54,170 --> 00:05:00,100
reference for these measurements on an

126
00:04:56,089 --> 00:05:00,099
actual scale actually

127
00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:17,740
