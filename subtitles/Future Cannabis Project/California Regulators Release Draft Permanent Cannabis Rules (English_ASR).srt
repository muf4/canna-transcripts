2
00:00:14,689 --> 00:00:23,070
on Friday July 13th Friday the 13th the

3
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:25,920
regulatory agencies demonstrated they

4
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:29,460
have not lost their sense of humor by on

5
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:33,179
this auspicious day releasing the draft

6
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:35,489
permanent regulations that will dictate

7
00:00:33,179 --> 00:00:39,780
the future of the cannabis industry in

8
00:00:35,488 --> 00:00:41,308
California so on that day Friday the

9
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:47,370
13th what happened

10
00:00:41,308 --> 00:00:50,459
what started 45-day comment period how

11
00:00:47,369 --> 00:00:57,000
many have issued their comments nobody

12
00:00:50,460 --> 00:01:01,260
because we're still reading over 300

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,539
pages of new regulations so today I have

14
00:01:01,259 --> 00:01:09,750
brought together this is Alexis DeAngelo

15
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:13,320
of CCI a and and dr. K Pamela Epstein of

16
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:16,938
green Weis consulting and Sarah

17
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:21,500
Armstrong of Americans for safe access

18
00:01:16,938 --> 00:01:25,379
so we wanted to talk about how to

19
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:27,900
compose an effective comment during this

20
00:01:25,379 --> 00:01:31,438
comment period this is a critical time

21
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:34,228
for the cannabis industry everything you

22
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:39,529
hate about the regulations this is your

23
00:01:34,228 --> 00:01:43,469
last chance to issue a well-thought-out

24
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:47,519
professional specific excellently

25
00:01:43,469 --> 00:01:51,118
written and argued comments to help the

26
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:54,688
agencies to see the error of their ways

27
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:56,578
in certain cases to support some of the

28
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:58,468
decisions that they've made that you may

29
00:01:56,578 --> 00:01:59,759
agree with it's that you doesn't have to

30
00:01:58,468 --> 00:02:03,468
be a negative comment it can be a

31
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:06,420
positive comment but it is essential to

32
00:02:03,468 --> 00:02:08,639
submit comments during this period if

33
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:11,098
you have a cannabis business and you

34
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:13,718
want to file a lawsuit later guess what

35
00:02:11,098 --> 00:02:16,479
if you didn't file a comment you can't

36
00:02:13,718 --> 00:02:18,699
you have to say something about the

37
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:21,818
issues at hand so I'm just gonna let

38
00:02:18,699 --> 00:02:24,188
these guys talk about it as well to give

39
00:02:21,818 --> 00:02:27,908
kind of some of the salient points of

40
00:02:24,188 --> 00:02:31,509
how you go about approaching the comment

41
00:02:27,908 --> 00:02:34,209
period how you can submit the comments

42
00:02:31,509 --> 00:02:37,780
and the opportunities to do so and what

43
00:02:34,209 --> 00:02:42,218
are the components of a effective

44
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:43,870
comment hi everyone so one of the things

45
00:02:42,218 --> 00:02:46,090
that is really important is make sure

46
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:48,340
that you have an entire statement but

47
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:51,098
also that you have a solution for that

48
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:52,959
statement just stating what you want

49
00:02:51,098 --> 00:02:54,818
they're just gonna bypass that so you

50
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,590
need to go in with a full statement of

51
00:02:54,818 --> 00:02:58,208
what you want and then tell them kind of

52
00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:00,039
how they can do it because then

53
00:02:58,209 --> 00:03:01,628
actuality they want to know how to do

54
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:07,688
their own job so we're gonna be doing

55
00:03:01,628 --> 00:03:09,638
that for them I think one important

56
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:13,150
thing to note is what also did not

57
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:15,930
happen on Friday the 13th nothing

58
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:18,729
changed so all of those readapted

59
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:21,009
regulations child-resistant see with all

60
00:03:18,729 --> 00:03:23,889
of the packaging that we just saw all of

61
00:03:21,008 --> 00:03:27,399
that stays in place so during this

62
00:03:23,889 --> 00:03:29,739
period where were effectively commenting

63
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:33,250
and telling these regulatory agencies

64
00:03:29,739 --> 00:03:35,349
this is what we would like to see at the

65
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:37,628
same time we need to maintain compliance

66
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:39,638
because here in California you can be

67
00:03:37,628 --> 00:03:42,698
dinged for that it could cost you your

68
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:45,129
annual permit you could be affected at

69
00:03:42,699 --> 00:03:47,560
the local level so maintain your active

70
00:03:45,128 --> 00:03:50,649
compliance now with a lens on what will

71
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:52,329
make your life easier in the future when

72
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:54,549
you're commenting and when you're

73
00:03:52,329 --> 00:03:57,009
commenting you want to ask a question

74
00:03:54,549 --> 00:04:00,519
provide a solution make sure the answer

75
00:03:57,008 --> 00:04:02,619
to your question is not a yes or a No

76
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:05,680
and that you're really facilitating of

77
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:07,180
response and it's difficult with some of

78
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,968
us being vertically integrated

79
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:12,639
businesses or a micro business that you

80
00:04:09,968 --> 00:04:16,060
may think that you can ask all of your

81
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:18,639
questions to the BCC and that you may

82
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:22,269
think logically that these agencies talk

83
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:24,819
to one another sometimes the regulations

84
00:04:22,269 --> 00:04:27,069
would beg to differ since owner seems to

85
00:04:24,819 --> 00:04:30,399
be a concept that is not

86
00:04:27,069 --> 00:04:33,480
reversal but you need to make your

87
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:38,349
specific comments to your specific

88
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:42,520
agencies that are in control of that

89
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:44,590
particular part of the supply chain and

90
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:47,560
then I'm gonna pass it along when things

91
00:04:44,589 --> 00:04:51,219
kicked off in 2005 we had no one to help

92
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:53,079
us lawyers were very reluctant lobbyists

93
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:55,690
were non-existence they in fact would

94
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:58,060
run the other way if you're economically

95
00:04:55,689 --> 00:05:00,670
in a position to hire a lawyer to write

96
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:03,370
a letter for you or you have a lobbyist

97
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:05,379
through your trade organization or you

98
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:07,420
have one of the many things that are now

99
00:05:05,379 --> 00:05:10,839
available to the cannabis community and

100
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:13,000
the money to access them go ahead and do

101
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:15,250
it it'll save you some time and I

102
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,279
promise you that you will be pleased

103
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:20,920
with the results many of you are small

104
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:23,019
business owners who really don't have a

105
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:27,960
lot of extra money right now

106
00:05:23,019 --> 00:05:29,439
things are tough so go to safe access

107
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:32,739
now.org

108
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:35,050
and right there on our website americans

109
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:36,460
for acts safe access will have all the

110
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:39,490
information you need to write an

111
00:05:36,459 --> 00:05:43,120
effective letter all by yourself it's

112
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:45,639
not that hard state your issue discuss

113
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:50,379
it say your solution and you're done

114
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:53,019
don't forget to cite the part of the

115
00:05:50,379 --> 00:05:55,930
regulation who that you are talking

116
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:58,329
about because there's over 500 pages of

117
00:05:55,930 --> 00:06:01,000
them so put the little section number

118
00:05:58,329 --> 00:06:03,939
and maybe a page number and once you're

119
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:07,360
done be proud of yourself because you're

120
00:06:03,939 --> 00:06:09,490
now part of the solution that's pretty

121
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:12,490
important but what's even more important

122
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:15,939
is if you don't weigh in people who have

123
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:19,000
interests contrary to yours will there

124
00:06:15,939 --> 00:06:21,579
are I think eleven police fraternal

125
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,970
organizations they have lobbyists they

126
00:06:21,579 --> 00:06:27,609
have lawyers and believe me they will be

127
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:30,310
weighing in the League of Cities is not

128
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:33,090
always a very helpful entity either and

129
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:37,060
they are well supplied with lawyers

130
00:06:33,089 --> 00:06:39,159
lobbyists and policy wonks the minute

131
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:40,629
you start becoming part of this process

132
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:44,110
it's addictive

133
00:06:40,629 --> 00:06:47,139
believe me yeah I know it doesn't seem

134
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:49,149
like it but the idea that you submitted

135
00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:51,309
a letter and then three months later you

136
00:06:49,149 --> 00:06:53,918
look down at those regs and by god they

137
00:06:51,309 --> 00:06:57,580
took out that really poisonous section

138
00:06:53,918 --> 00:07:00,728
that you were objecting to that is a

139
00:06:57,579 --> 00:07:03,959
high it is a genuine high and it's what

140
00:07:00,728 --> 00:07:07,209
keeps most policy wants going believe me

141
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:09,759
you have lots of trade organizations

142
00:07:07,209 --> 00:07:11,288
here in LA let them know how you feel

143
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:14,528
about things make sure they write

144
00:07:11,288 --> 00:07:17,829
detailed letters and get on with it

145
00:07:14,528 --> 00:07:20,139
because honestly you are the voice of

146
00:07:17,829 --> 00:07:22,240
cannabis in California the people

147
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:24,249
running things up in Sacramento at the

148
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:27,459
bureau they freely admit they don't know

149
00:07:24,249 --> 00:07:29,349
anything so the next time you open up

150
00:07:27,459 --> 00:07:33,189
those rigs and they want you to have

151
00:07:29,348 --> 00:07:37,838
24-hour Mans security which will double

152
00:07:33,189 --> 00:07:39,580
your your security bill every month and

153
00:07:37,838 --> 00:07:41,918
you write in and it comes right out

154
00:07:39,579 --> 00:07:43,688
where you're not just talking alone you

155
00:07:41,918 --> 00:07:46,299
are part of a community speaking with

156
00:07:43,689 --> 00:07:49,449
one voice and that's very important I

157
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:52,749
know that it's hard to look at a 65 year

158
00:07:49,449 --> 00:07:54,550
old woman and think that anything she'd

159
00:07:52,749 --> 00:07:58,209
have to say would be terribly germane

160
00:07:54,550 --> 00:08:02,439
but I am telling you if you're not at

161
00:07:58,209 --> 00:08:04,509
the table your lunch and in and in this

162
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:06,579
environment this highly complex

163
00:08:04,509 --> 00:08:09,309
environment if you're not at the table

164
00:08:06,579 --> 00:08:13,569
somebody is going to eat your lunch so

165
00:08:09,309 --> 00:08:16,449
please don't slack off this is your time

166
00:08:13,569 --> 00:08:19,269
but if they don't hear from you this

167
00:08:16,449 --> 00:08:20,919
time they never come again so where can

168
00:08:19,269 --> 00:08:22,658
you comment and how can you come in

169
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:25,868
should probably let you guys know that

170
00:08:22,658 --> 00:08:29,649
right ah the agencies will take your

171
00:08:25,869 --> 00:08:32,259
comments via email you can call them or

172
00:08:29,649 --> 00:08:36,818
you can snail mail them comments more

173
00:08:32,259 --> 00:08:39,310
you can attend one of the many roadshow

174
00:08:36,818 --> 00:08:42,818
as I like to call them hearing dates

175
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:45,458
there's one on August 7th in Oakland

176
00:08:42,818 --> 00:08:48,129
there's one on August 14th in Los

177
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:50,018
Angeles and then on the last day that

178
00:08:48,129 --> 00:08:53,049
you can submit comments which is also

179
00:08:50,019 --> 00:08:54,320
important to note on August 27th there

180
00:08:53,049 --> 00:08:56,569
will be one in

181
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,520
Himeno all of your comments must be

182
00:08:56,570 --> 00:09:01,730
received by the agency in whatever

183
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:07,189
outlet you choose to let them know no

184
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:10,930
later than 5:00 p.m. on August 27th and

185
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:14,780
as everybody has set up here this is a

186
00:09:10,929 --> 00:09:18,549
empowering moment you are the industry

187
00:09:14,779 --> 00:09:21,199
and the industry needs you to speak up

188
00:09:18,549 --> 00:09:23,029
because this is the opportunity for you

189
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:26,660
to comment not just on the new

190
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:29,389
information but on anything within the

191
00:09:26,659 --> 00:09:32,529
regulations this is our last opportunity

192
00:09:29,389 --> 00:09:35,809
where they will be evaluating and

193
00:09:32,529 --> 00:09:38,720
updating these regulations in full

194
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:41,119
moving forward it will just be what the

195
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:43,759
regulatory agencies are authorized to do

196
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,169
potentially issue new licenses or you

197
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:47,689
have to go through the legislative

198
00:09:45,169 --> 00:09:50,419
process this is the last time that you

199
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:53,930
can go to them as the public and they

200
00:09:50,419 --> 00:09:56,509
must respond to you legally as a lawyer

201
00:09:53,929 --> 00:09:59,629
there is a great lineage of case law in

202
00:09:56,509 --> 00:10:03,139
this area that every single comment they

203
00:09:59,629 --> 00:10:06,289
receive they must respond to and they

204
00:10:03,139 --> 00:10:09,049
are not allowed to say comment noted so

205
00:10:06,289 --> 00:10:11,659
if you ask a question if you provide a

206
00:10:09,049 --> 00:10:14,389
solution they have to address it and

207
00:10:11,659 --> 00:10:19,719
respond to it in a meaningful manner as

208
00:10:14,389 --> 00:10:19,720
long as asterisks it is relevant to them

209
00:10:21,009 --> 00:10:27,230
so part of the way to ensure that

210
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:30,410
relevance is by as was mentioned earlier

211
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:32,840
being specific you're gonna want to cite

212
00:10:30,409 --> 00:10:36,100
the actual regulation that you are

213
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:39,080
responding to and offer the citation of

214
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:41,120
what section what part what is your

215
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:43,520
comment based on you're gonna want to

216
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:46,100
explain the problem that you see with

217
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:48,289
the regulation as written and then

218
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:51,740
you're gonna want to offer a solution of

219
00:10:48,289 --> 00:10:54,230
how in light of this issue you would

220
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:56,870
suggest that they actually correct it if

221
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:59,029
you send them a letter that says you're

222
00:10:56,870 --> 00:11:01,789
destroying the cannabis industry please

223
00:10:59,029 --> 00:11:05,000
go away that's not a relevant comment

224
00:11:01,789 --> 00:11:06,829
that they need to respond to all of the

225
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,208
comments that are submitted become

226
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:10,220
public record

227
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:13,068
they will be able to be read by the

228
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:15,860
public they have to provide a reason for

229
00:11:13,068 --> 00:11:17,628
either why they agree with the comment

230
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:19,519
or they don't agree with the comment and

231
00:11:17,629 --> 00:11:23,240
why it was incorporated or why it wasn't

232
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:25,100
incorporated in the the locations for

233
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:28,159
these hearings each agency is doing

234
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:30,649
their own series of hearings so the

235
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:33,350
Bureau of cannabis controlled BCC will

236
00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:35,600
do hearings in Oakland Los Angeles and

237
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:37,850
Sacramento the Department of Public

238
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:40,670
Health which oversees manufacturing will

239
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:44,240
do them in Brea Eureka and Oakland and

240
00:11:40,669 --> 00:11:47,539
the department of food and agriculture

241
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:50,778
vation will do them in Eureka Riverside

242
00:11:47,539 --> 00:11:53,509
Santa Barbara and Sacramento the as

243
00:11:50,778 --> 00:11:56,568
published the public hearings are only

244
00:11:53,509 --> 00:11:58,699
scheduled to be two hours long so if you

245
00:11:56,568 --> 00:12:00,948
are going to give public comments I

246
00:11:58,698 --> 00:12:03,229
would be prepared to have your comment

247
00:12:00,948 --> 00:12:05,028
written so that if they do not have time

248
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:07,039
for you to go sometimes they set up

249
00:12:05,028 --> 00:12:09,558
stations they have places there you can

250
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:11,688
submit but don't only assure that you're

251
00:12:09,558 --> 00:12:13,188
gonna be able to make a verbal comment

252
00:12:11,688 --> 00:12:15,498
when you if you go to one of these

253
00:12:13,188 --> 00:12:17,868
public hearings and it's great to submit

254
00:12:15,499 --> 00:12:21,889
the comments anyway you can to sit on

255
00:12:17,869 --> 00:12:25,459
all channels I understand this is an

256
00:12:21,889 --> 00:12:28,188
incredibly complicated process the regs

257
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:30,469
are not fun to read some of the

258
00:12:28,188 --> 00:12:33,289
implications are not clear of what the

259
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:35,749
of what they are so I also highly

260
00:12:33,289 --> 00:12:37,428
suggest that you get connected with

261
00:12:35,749 --> 00:12:40,369
other people who are going through this

262
00:12:37,428 --> 00:12:43,338
process to have those conversation to go

263
00:12:40,369 --> 00:12:44,689
through the language and make sure that

264
00:12:43,339 --> 00:12:46,369
the way you're reading it is the way

265
00:12:44,688 --> 00:12:48,409
other people are reading it to really

266
00:12:46,369 --> 00:12:50,449
communicate and collaborate on these

267
00:12:48,409 --> 00:12:52,969
things many of you are operating

268
00:12:50,448 --> 00:12:54,528
businesses you don't have time to sit

269
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:56,689
there and read hundreds of pages of

270
00:12:54,528 --> 00:12:58,730
regulations and offer you know really

271
00:12:56,688 --> 00:13:02,118
well-thought-out comments there are

272
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:04,610
trade organizations and groups and many

273
00:13:02,119 --> 00:13:08,389
people going through that process right

274
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:12,318
now so if you do have a brand you have a

275
00:13:08,389 --> 00:13:14,119
logo you have a company you can connect

276
00:13:12,318 --> 00:13:16,909
with other people who are who are

277
00:13:14,119 --> 00:13:19,910
writing a large letter and sign on have

278
00:13:16,909 --> 00:13:22,009
a magic logo if they're representing a

279
00:13:19,909 --> 00:13:26,449
comment that you also support

280
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:30,620
speaks volumes the regular agencies can

281
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:32,420
see that the industry is in accord on

282
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:34,250
certain things and that there's a lot of

283
00:13:32,419 --> 00:13:36,679
agreement in force as Sarah was saying

284
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:39,049
that security guard there was only a

285
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:41,599
five day comment period in the last

286
00:13:39,049 --> 00:13:43,159
update and they slid something in there

287
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:46,009
and they had to take it right out

288
00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:47,929
because the industry response and the

289
00:13:46,009 --> 00:13:50,360
amount of comments that they received

290
00:13:47,929 --> 00:13:53,709
was so overwhelming that it was clear

291
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:56,690
that this was not a good direction so

292
00:13:53,710 --> 00:14:00,710
there is nothing I can say right now

293
00:13:56,690 --> 00:14:03,680
it's gonna be it's gonna that I can

294
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:07,129
emphasize as much as I'd like to how

295
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:10,669
important this period of time is this is

296
00:14:07,129 --> 00:14:13,490
the last train leaving the station for

297
00:14:10,669 --> 00:14:16,370
this industry that gets really

298
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:18,710
complicated after this the process is

299
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:22,539
laborious as Pamela was saying it's a

300
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:25,040
heavy legislative lift it is slow slow

301
00:14:22,539 --> 00:14:28,250
processes of government from here on out

302
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:31,339
this is this is the opportunity for the

303
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:34,580
public to have immediate and impactful

304
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:38,840
results based on the feedback you give

305
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:42,980
the government and the fact that I had

306
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:46,340
the opportunity to watch laws change

307
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:50,120
based on something somebody said that

308
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:53,180
made sense that is a powerful experience

309
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:56,210
to realize in the midst of all this

310
00:14:53,179 --> 00:14:58,039
bullshit we live in that works sometimes

311
00:14:56,210 --> 00:15:00,800
to give you guys some time frame

312
00:14:58,039 --> 00:15:03,829
knowledge if you have to legislatively

313
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:06,049
Lobby to get a bill to change these

314
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:08,420
regulations once they are effective

315
00:15:06,049 --> 00:15:10,370
those even if you're able to make that

316
00:15:08,419 --> 00:15:12,620
change that year it doesn't go into

317
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:14,389
effect until the following year the

318
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:16,850
first of the following year these

319
00:15:14,389 --> 00:15:20,449
regulations because we had emergency

320
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:22,340
regulations they must within 180 days

321
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:24,200
from the last time we went through this

322
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:27,019
process with the read option of the

323
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,860
emergency regulations have to have final

324
00:15:27,019 --> 00:15:31,370
regulations

325
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:33,289
once those are adopted their final so if

326
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:35,429
you don't like that all of your

327
00:15:33,289 --> 00:15:37,889
packaging for example must be

328
00:15:35,429 --> 00:15:41,399
child resistant and tamper-evident at

329
00:15:37,889 --> 00:15:45,330
the at the actual product versus the

330
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:48,750
exit bags and that stays because we as

331
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:51,300
an industry support some of what the

332
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:54,208
Department of Public Health and BCC are

333
00:15:51,299 --> 00:15:56,219
saying then it stays if it doesn't and

334
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:59,129
there are others out there law

335
00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:02,700
enforcement for example mothers who are

336
00:15:59,129 --> 00:16:05,009
protecting the children who are you know

337
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:06,839
alcohol bottles aren't that safe you can

338
00:16:05,009 --> 00:16:07,679
twist them and open them but that is

339
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:10,350
besides the point

340
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:12,929
they will comment out so it's not just

341
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:15,028
that industry is commenting it is your

342
00:16:12,929 --> 00:16:17,278
opposition is commenting as well so

343
00:16:15,028 --> 00:16:20,458
nothing that is in these rigs now that

344
00:16:17,278 --> 00:16:23,519
you like or you don't like will stack it

345
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:26,458
can't change so comment comment comment

346
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:29,338
comment I cannot say it enough no

347
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:31,169
comment is insignificant as Julie said

348
00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:34,080
if there's ever litigation in the future

349
00:16:31,169 --> 00:16:36,599
that is administrative and closed looped

350
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:40,139
meaning that the only thing that you can

351
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:42,389
argue is what was said not what was not

352
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:44,819
said so there's no such thing Madlock

353
00:16:42,389 --> 00:16:47,429
smoking gun all of that does not exist

354
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:50,750
in the administrative process it's the

355
00:16:47,429 --> 00:16:53,909
agency is only responsible to address

356
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:56,519
modify what they are told when they are

357
00:16:53,909 --> 00:17:01,528
given the opportunity to solicit

358
00:16:56,519 --> 00:17:04,889
information does anyone have any

359
00:17:01,528 --> 00:17:10,740
questions about the comment period or

360
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:13,230
its importance the question is that it

361
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:15,720
is very well what the gentleman is

362
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:20,880
suggesting is that it is also important

363
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:23,670
to understand what can be dealt with in

364
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:26,699
the regulations and what is embedded

365
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:29,250
into the regulations by statute which is

366
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:33,420
the there are things that were made

367
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:36,480
explicit in proposition 64 that the

368
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:39,000
agencies do not have the power to alter

369
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:42,690
there are certain things that are hard

370
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:45,900
wired into the regs so it is important

371
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:49,140
to know the value of your comment will

372
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:51,540
be also affected by

373
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:54,390
there or not these things are covered by

374
00:17:51,539 --> 00:17:57,119
statute or that are off their regulatory

375
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:59,580
and able to be altered so it's a great

376
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:03,239
time to have a reading party and go back

377
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:06,419
and read prop 64 and see what people

378
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:09,120
actually voted for and what elements are

379
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:13,529
hardwired into there that may not be

380
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:17,609
able to be retracted for example an

381
00:18:13,529 --> 00:18:21,119
excise tax hardwired into the system the

382
00:18:17,609 --> 00:18:24,149
the amount and the fact that it exists

383
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:25,889
so something like a comment that says I

384
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:27,180
don't like the excise tax you should

385
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:29,009
take that out you're destroying

386
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:33,029
businesses and we can't compete with the

387
00:18:29,009 --> 00:18:35,519
illicit market while true may is not

388
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:37,349
something that the regulators have the

389
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:41,129
capacity to change because it's

390
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:43,769
hardwired that would require a bill or

391
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:45,930
perhaps a lawsuit to question why an

392
00:18:43,769 --> 00:18:50,089
adult use bill has the power to apply an

393
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:50,090
excise tax to a medical market anyway I

394
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:56,849
don't know how that happened so so

395
00:18:54,599 --> 00:19:00,299
that's a really important clarification

396
00:18:56,849 --> 00:19:02,029
to know what's in statute and what do

397
00:19:00,299 --> 00:19:05,039
the regulator's have wiggle room

398
00:19:02,029 --> 00:19:08,240
oversight on in the ability to create

399
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:08,240
regulations around

400
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:15,519
oh hello you are talking a lot about how

401
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:18,600
once the emergency ring sorry the

402
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:21,849
regular regulations are confirmed that

403
00:19:18,599 --> 00:19:23,379
pushed out of mitigating it or barred

404
00:19:21,849 --> 00:19:24,759
from litigating can you expand on that a

405
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:27,820
little bit I'm not sure sir

406
00:19:24,759 --> 00:19:32,019
no yeah from from litigating we're

407
00:19:27,819 --> 00:19:34,379
welcome to America no I'm what it is is

408
00:19:32,019 --> 00:19:37,240
this is an administrative process and

409
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:39,820
therefore you are limited in what you

410
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:42,819
can sue over what claims you can make

411
00:19:39,819 --> 00:19:46,119
you have to raise them for the agency so

412
00:19:42,819 --> 00:19:47,919
if you don't raise an issue during the

413
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:49,809
administrative process during this

414
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:52,539
public comment period you are precluded

415
00:19:49,809 --> 00:19:54,099
from telling the agency that they did

416
00:19:52,539 --> 00:19:56,950
not do a good enough job

417
00:19:54,099 --> 00:19:59,769
that's why commenting is so important

418
00:19:56,950 --> 00:20:02,799
and why your comments are important

419
00:19:59,769 --> 00:20:05,619
because if that's what your lenses then

420
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:08,230
you need to make sure that you have

421
00:20:05,619 --> 00:20:11,529
fully articulated that to the agency's

422
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:13,089
ability to address it for example if you

423
00:20:11,529 --> 00:20:15,970
want to look at what happened with the

424
00:20:13,089 --> 00:20:18,459
lawsuit against the DEA that was with

425
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:21,549
CBD that was one of the major issues

426
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:24,220
that the court had was that they did not

427
00:20:21,549 --> 00:20:27,309
exhaust their administrative remedies by

428
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:29,829
providing the very intricate comment

429
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:32,919
that they were arguing over in the

430
00:20:29,829 --> 00:20:35,829
litigation so that's a same or similar

431
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:37,600
industry situation you have to comment

432
00:20:35,829 --> 00:20:40,480
you cannot sit back and hope that

433
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:43,379
somebody else provides the comment that

434
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,380
you want to make

435
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:52,040
titanians they're like a retail so that

436
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:54,798
type nine is it

437
00:20:52,039 --> 00:20:58,220
making anything that the people do that

438
00:20:54,798 --> 00:21:02,808
use a top-line just as it anybody they

439
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:05,269
don't have you always have to have a

440
00:21:02,808 --> 00:21:08,298
building so these are land use related

441
00:21:05,269 --> 00:21:09,980
licenses every license has a land use

442
00:21:08,298 --> 00:21:12,440
component now you can be a delivery

443
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:14,808
service that operates out of a building

444
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:18,558
that's properly permitted at the local

445
00:21:14,808 --> 00:21:20,418
level but you can't just you know be no

446
00:21:18,558 --> 00:21:23,450
license can operate into residence but

447
00:21:20,419 --> 00:21:25,460
you can't have like a P o box and then a

448
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:28,308
computer in your room and run a delivery

449
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:30,640
service this is a big issue for a so we

450
00:21:28,308 --> 00:21:34,129
feel patient should have access to

451
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:36,320
delivery and one of the most glorious

452
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:39,669
moments when I looked at the rags was

453
00:21:36,319 --> 00:21:43,308
the language that would allow you as a

454
00:21:39,669 --> 00:21:47,059
licensed provider to deliver all over

455
00:21:43,308 --> 00:21:50,119
not just in the few jurisdictions that

456
00:21:47,058 --> 00:21:52,009
were open enough to allow the sick and

457
00:21:50,119 --> 00:21:56,479
dying to have access to their medicine

458
00:21:52,009 --> 00:21:58,730
in their homes if you want that to stay

459
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:01,039
in the rags then you need to write a

460
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:04,759
letter and you need to write a letter

461
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:09,079
now because not only is the League of

462
00:22:04,759 --> 00:22:12,910
Cities very much against this but retail

463
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:15,589
operators are not always thrilled either

464
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:20,000
this is where the rubber meets the road

465
00:22:15,589 --> 00:22:22,519
folks if you want the good stuff you

466
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:25,039
have to fight for it and you have to

467
00:22:22,519 --> 00:22:27,440
fight hard because your opponents are

468
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:29,389
well equipped with lots of money and

469
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:32,029
lots of time and you don't have much of

470
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:35,660
either but if you care about delivery

471
00:22:32,029 --> 00:22:38,329
please write to the bureau and tell them

472
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:41,570
how important it is to you because a so

473
00:22:38,329 --> 00:22:43,909
we'll be writing my trade organization

474
00:22:41,569 --> 00:22:48,519
the Southern California Coalition will

475
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:48,519
be very much writing about this

476
00:22:55,009 --> 00:22:59,960
your comment letter for ease of

477
00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:02,759
reference you want to keep them

478
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:05,309
continuous right so topic and then all

479
00:23:02,759 --> 00:23:08,279
of your points but as long as it's the

480
00:23:05,309 --> 00:23:10,919
same n in the same agency so if it's the

481
00:23:08,279 --> 00:23:13,349
BCC and you're a retail or a micro

482
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:15,930
business a distributor sting lab and you

483
00:23:13,349 --> 00:23:18,899
have common any of those they can all go

484
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:20,700
in one letter absolutely and the

485
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:22,740
agencies have put out some really great

486
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:25,590
guidelines that's on their website if

487
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:28,259
you go to the BCC site the CDFA site or

488
00:23:25,589 --> 00:23:31,529
the Department of Public Health they

489
00:23:28,259 --> 00:23:32,910
have these little instructions the

490
00:23:31,529 --> 00:23:35,609
Department of Public Health is lagging

491
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:39,810
on the design aspect but that's alright

492
00:23:35,609 --> 00:23:43,500
the information still there the BCC does

493
00:23:39,809 --> 00:23:45,149
a really good job of breaking down how

494
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:47,009
to do it how to put a heading how to

495
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:50,340
make the citation how to explain the

496
00:23:47,009 --> 00:23:53,490
problem and and how to provide your

497
00:23:50,339 --> 00:23:56,789
solution and the amazing thing I've been

498
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:59,940
working with the agencies as well time

499
00:23:56,789 --> 00:24:01,950
with them is they really are amazingly

500
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:04,980
open in this moment of time to

501
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:09,090
suggestions they do not know how to do

502
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:11,610
this events special events that license

503
00:24:09,089 --> 00:24:14,639
type gets very little attention it got

504
00:24:11,609 --> 00:24:16,740
very little revision I think that if you

505
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:19,470
look at what happened with chalice if

506
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:22,650
you look at the difficulty that is going

507
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:25,049
to be forthcoming that the bureau I fail

508
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:27,650
to understand that part of 64 was that

509
00:24:25,049 --> 00:24:30,990
the people wanted to have direct access

510
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:34,259
that that special event license type

511
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:36,960
doesn't entitle you to be a limited

512
00:24:34,259 --> 00:24:39,359
retailer or distributor and now the only

513
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:41,460
thing they did change was that you have

514
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:43,799
to have designated areas for that but

515
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:45,840
then only retailers can come so it's

516
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:49,379
very convoluted it's a very difficult

517
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:51,269
issue but it is one that is generally

518
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:54,240
important to the public I think that's

519
00:24:51,269 --> 00:24:58,109
one of the ones that people universally

520
00:24:54,240 --> 00:25:00,990
want it is universally by the BCC sort

521
00:24:58,109 --> 00:25:02,699
of the redheaded stepchild so if you

522
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:04,440
have a brand and you want to be able to

523
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:07,440
get direct to market without

524
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:09,900
going through a retailer to a special

525
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:12,330
event and that's been sort of your

526
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:15,480
mainstay of how you've interfaced with

527
00:25:12,329 --> 00:25:17,429
your customers or patients there's no

528
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:19,319
allowance for that so I encourage

529
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:21,210
everyone please reach out to Americans

530
00:25:19,319 --> 00:25:24,059
