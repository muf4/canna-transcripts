1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:06,160
so i'm sam from the grove uh we run a

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,400
science-based competition where you know

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,000
we're reliant on uh excellence in

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,679
breeding because everyone starts with

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,798
identical genetics and then they're

6
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:17,039
judged by lab results for total terp and

7
00:00:14,798 --> 00:00:17,039
total

8
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,510
[Music]

9
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:32,159
thank you um so yeah i reached out to

10
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,399
peter because

11
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:37,599
it's our biggest year ever we're going

12
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:39,280
to eight states uh this podcast is

13
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,800
actually representing every single time

14
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,439
zone in the country

15
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:45,280
and we need quality breeders state by

16
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:46,320
state to give out these cuts to our

17
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,920
growers

18
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,920
we put them through the ringer you know

19
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:53,600
they have to meet certain metrics pass

20
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,280
certain tests pest inspections etc

21
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,719
it's an awesome group of guys i wanted

22
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,198
to get them all together although i had

23
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:01,760
to wear my by weed from women sure

24
00:00:59,198 --> 00:01:03,119
because i'm looking for female like

25
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:05,920
ladies that do some breeding and

26
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:08,000
genetics for next year so hit us up

27
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,320
uh let's i guess go through

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,040
introductions uh that makes sense right

29
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:13,039
so

30
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,360
this weekend we just handed out clones

31
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,600
in michigan

32
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:20,959
michigan and oklahoma

33
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:22,798
and let's meet them first so

34
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:25,199
uh this begins on the east coast so

35
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:29,280
technically we're first so

36
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,879
i'll introduce ross from fresh seeds and

37
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,280
i don't know if we can hear if we can

38
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:35,438
get questions from people tuning in that

39
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,960
would be cool and then they can ask

40
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:39,679
anything they want except what the

41
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:41,199
mystery strain is flower time like we

42
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,280
can't talk about what they got but we

43
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,000
can get to know these breeders and

44
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:48,399
genetics partners so uh ross fresh coast

45
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,959
seeds our michigan partner

46
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,960
what's up

47
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,759
so ross what do you want to tell what

48
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:59,919
can you tell us about yourself your

49
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,920
process what you love about michigan

50
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:05,759
well those are pretty broad but um yeah

51
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:08,318
so i'm born and raised in michigan um 39

52
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,598
years old um

53
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:12,079
i guess uh

54
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:14,159
just how i got it even into into

55
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,719
cannabis i was younger you know and like

56
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:18,719
in high school hustling

57
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:20,959
bricks of weed you know doing the thing

58
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:22,959
right and i always had a passion for it

59
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:25,120
but then throughout life i did other

60
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:28,319
things and then i had a major back

61
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,879
injury in the bering sea so i came home

62
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:33,598
and uh just kind of had to rework my

63
00:02:30,878 --> 00:02:35,679
whole life so um i got into like third

64
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:36,959
coast um garden and i worked with him

65
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,879
for a while

66
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,360
and then uh

67
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:44,159
doing my own thing and

68
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:47,200
i really never had any intention of

69
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:49,519
necessarily of breeding um but i was

70
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:50,479
like you know up at four in the morning

71
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,800
buying

72
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:57,280
thousands of dollars worth of seeds and

73
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,280
looking at all the lineages um

74
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:02,799
and uh

75
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:04,878
and one thing led to another and it took

76
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:08,400
me about six years to lock down like

77
00:03:04,878 --> 00:03:10,399
nine females um and i don't know

78
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,599
i'm pretty picky when it comes to plant

79
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:16,239
selection um but i i came up with these

80
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:18,959
females and then like i was telling you

81
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:21,519
i had an experience just uh having a

82
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,039
conversation with the universe um

83
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,200
and i just got i was really sick of

84
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:28,079
doing production stuff and

85
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:30,399
and she gave me the idea of a fresh

86
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,360
coast seed company and starting a seed

87
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:36,000
company so within 24 hours i had

88
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,640
fresh coast seed company llc

89
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,318
and uh i moved out of the lake houses

90
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:43,759
and we went and bought

91
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:45,598
20 acres in bel air and

92
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:49,280
we started breeding immediately and i

93
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:52,000
had the right females to do it with

94
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,519
and everything and that was seven years

95
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,919
ago so

96
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,599
here we are now and

97
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:59,679
the brand has actually gotten way bigger

98
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:02,318
than what i can handle so i'm working on

99
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,080
that part right now um

100
00:04:02,318 --> 00:04:05,759
but yeah so that's just kind of a little

101
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,920
rundown of how i got to where i'm at

102
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:09,438
right now

103
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:12,238
awesome thank you

104
00:04:09,438 --> 00:04:13,919

107
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:19,679
partner

108
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:21,039
welcome robbie hey trying to find an

109
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,759
angle that gets me in the camera here we

110
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,759

111
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,919
all right hey welcome everybody

112
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,800
um yeah so

113
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:31,519
um this year i did the uh the oklahoma

114
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:35,918
drop we did the colorado drop last year

115
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:38,159
um for the the clone selection um

116
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:39,758
you know the this year we we had a

117
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:44,160
little bit experience with the the

118
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:46,479
contest um so we we had a little bit of

119
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:49,040
i would say different parameters um when

120
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:51,199
we were selecting for the contest in

121
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:54,479
oklahoma knowing a lot more about how

122
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:56,720
the contest works um you know and a lot

123
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:58,639
of the things that we could potentially

124
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,039
see in the contest

125
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:03,439
um because yeah when we did our our

126
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:05,360
colorado one we we broke a couple

127
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:06,959
records you know both good and bad we

128
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,879
broke records

129
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:12,879
um am i not talking

130
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:13,839
sam can you hear me no we can hear you

131
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:15,120
there's just other people in the

132
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:16,560
background that i'm saying to mute

133
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,918
yourself because we hear everything

134
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,280
going on back there but you're fine i

135
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:20,478
hear you

136
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:23,599
sorry about that

137
00:05:20,478 --> 00:05:26,478
uh i just got confused um anyway so yeah

138
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:28,639
we broke a couple records in colorado uh

139
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:30,399
one bad one for most hermes and one good

140
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,478
one for highest terps

141
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:33,839
so you know that's that's just how it

142
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:36,319
works sometimes

143
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:39,119
um but uh

144
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:41,759
when we went and had seen how the uh the

145
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,879
contest works and knew a lot more uh

146
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,639
about it

147
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:46,319
um you know it changed the way we

148
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,079
selected for it when i selected in

149
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:50,240
colorado i was really trying to select

150
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:54,159
for something that had the potential to

151
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:55,840
uh break some records um and when we did

152
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,600
it in oklahoma

153
00:05:55,839 --> 00:06:00,239
we were really looking for something

154
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,759
that was going to be uh you know

155
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,120
something that could be a staple strain

156
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,439
out here something that was really

157
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,680
different from anything that

158
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:10,560
is being seen on any of the shelves out

159
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,918
here or uh you know any of the things

160
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,478
that uh

161
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:16,799
um are are sort of what is hitting the

162
00:06:14,478 --> 00:06:19,519
the norm you know like oklahoma's a new

163
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:22,639
market so we're seeing a lot of the same

164
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:24,560
10 strains that get recycled out here um

165
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,759
so we we tried to bring something that

166
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,439
was going to be a totally different

167
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,960
flavor profile something that was going

168
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:30,959
to be a totally different

169
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:32,719
high than anything that is

170
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:34,159
is really being brought to the table

171
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:38,560
right now and so that's what we brought

172
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,560
for the the oklahoma on the show

173
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:43,359
oh sam you're muted

174
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,960
cool yeah so that's a good point robbie

175
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:50,800
thank you that like i mentioned we have

176
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:53,198
certain metrics that we ask all of you

177
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,879
guys to hit when we look at strains and

178
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:58,000
you know

179
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:58,000
who is that crunching

180
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:04,240
uh yeah so when one of those is

181
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,240
it can't be me is it

182
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,479
is it me

183
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:12,478
okay uh yeah so and one of those metrics

184
00:07:10,478 --> 00:07:13,758
is like that we are looking for

185
00:07:12,478 --> 00:07:15,839
something that's not widely on the

186
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,360
market because we take these six months

187
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:19,198
of the competition

188
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,879
you know hyping up all these growers

189
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,319
this mystery strain

190
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:24,079
everyone that's in a competition is

191
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,400
going to bother every single one of you

192
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:27,839
and say what is it tell me tell me

193
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:29,038
they'll be making their guesses and you

194
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:30,638
guys have to keep your mouth shut

195
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:32,000
because it's part of the fun

196
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:33,598
uh and we want to make sure it's

197
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,759
something cool so when it hits the

198
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:37,839
market at the end of the year it flies

199
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,840
off shelves i mean

200
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:42,159
hey dave

201
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:44,478
and uh so yeah it's that's one of the

202
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,319
metrics the other is you know we we do

203
00:07:44,478 --> 00:07:48,639
pest and pathogen testing to make sure

204
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:50,560
these are very clean cuts as well

205
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,720
if uh people watching don't know what

206
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,560
hop sleet and viroid is i encourage you

207
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,080
to google it reach out to any of us here

208
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,959
i'm sure we can talk to you through all

209
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:59,598
that

210
00:07:56,959 --> 00:08:01,359
so just to recap michigan oklahoma

211
00:07:59,598 --> 00:08:04,399
dropped on sunday but you can still pick

212
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:07,439
up clones there this week only you can

213
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:10,399
just dm us or sign up at thegrowoff.com

214
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:13,839
and let's move on our next clone drop

215
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:15,918
will be in colorado our home state with

216
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:17,598
uh dark horse genetics and i'm going to

217
00:08:15,918 --> 00:08:20,598
introduce caesar now who's doing that

218
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:20,598
one

219
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:34,958
we can hear you but your wi-fi is a

220
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,200
little choppy yeah that's nothing around

221
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:37,199
here

222
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:42,000
uh yeah if anything we do have the

223
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,759
genetics ready i

224
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,320
got them in the clown a few days ago so

225
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:48,799
i'm looking at them they're behind me

226
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,800
just uh looking for them i got way more

227
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:54,759
than i needed but i'd rather have more

228
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:54,759
than i need unless the negative

229
00:08:56,559 --> 00:09:00,399
i love it so actually caesar i need to

230
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,759
ask you because we're getting close to

231
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:03,919
the number that you told me we had to

232
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:06,080
cut it off at do we have more

233
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:09,679
entries available or we got to cut it at

234
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:13,040
100. so there's 206 in the corner right

235
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:14,719
now assuming everyone roots uh

236
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:16,480
should have more than i need

237
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,839
then once i get a little closer to the

238
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,278
dead i could possibly feel more

239
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:21,200
comfortable about opening up to a little

240
00:09:19,278 --> 00:09:22,720
bit more people

241
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,720
perfect all right we'll keep you all

242
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:27,040
posted i think we have like maybe 10

243
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,440
spots left if we're keeping at a hundred

244
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:31,360
but actually this is a good point so not

245
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,959
only do they have to get us cuts for the

246
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,800
you know all of the participants but you

247
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:37,278
have to grow more than you need so that

248
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:39,359
we have you know an even

249
00:09:37,278 --> 00:09:40,958
uh crop for so that everyone's getting

250
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,919
the same thing so

251
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:45,759
a lot of challenges we throw at you guys

252
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:46,559
i appreciate you so much for doing this

253
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:49,759
so

254
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:52,000
uh the one after colorado is going to be

255
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:53,919
california and because it's the biggest

256
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,320
friggin state we have to do three clone

257
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:59,759
drops those are going to be in humble

258
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:02,560
oakland and san diego and i will

259
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:05,838
introduce daniel and dave from hendricks

260
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:08,078
farm now how much of us are in the frame

261
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,360
are we both in the frame yep

262
00:10:08,078 --> 00:10:11,599
nice

263
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,519
yo this is dave i'm daniel

264
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,959
uh we're with hendricks nursery we're in

265
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:16,720
humboldt county

266
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:19,199
we're stoked to do this is our fourth

267
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,600
year doing the grow-off um

268
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:24,560
it's kind of our favorite and like most

269
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:27,519
unique challenge is get everybody

270
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:30,078
perfect unique clones on a date and keep

271
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:32,078
a mystery strain um

272
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:34,000
that you guys haven't seen before and i

273
00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:36,559
think we did a really good job this year

274
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,320
we love working with uh sam and it's

275
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:40,239
really fun to be here on this call get

276
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,278
to see all the other breeders it's like

277
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,759
i wish i

278
00:10:41,278 --> 00:10:45,600
i i was a fan of the girl off before we

279
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:46,958
ever were asked to be the nursery it

280
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,680
just seemed like the coolest thing to

281
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:51,518
compete in and uh we wish we could grow

282
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:53,359
all your guys genetics all the other

283
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:55,039
breeders out there it would be really

284
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,440
fun to go from state to state yeah we

285
00:10:55,039 --> 00:11:00,480
don't do a strain swap

286
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,480
can we make that happen

287
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:07,939
[Laughter]

288
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:12,078
yeah i mean daniel you've been reaching

289
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:13,838
out to previous years

290
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:16,239
genetic partners and linking up with

291
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:18,000
them i thought that was so cool and like

292
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,680
the one person who was not able to be

293
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:24,480
here i was bummed we have uh like an sop

294
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:26,639
officer now um wendy kornberg from sun

295
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,720
abyss wrote up some sops so we're all

296
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:30,720
kind of on the same page everyone state

297
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:34,320
to state is getting you know similar

298
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:36,079
clones or just quality um and she could

299
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,000
not be here today

300
00:11:36,078 --> 00:11:40,319
but and i totally lost my train of

301
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,399
thought where we were headed but uh

302
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,519
she's oh she's trying to grab one of

303
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,440
each of them because she's doing those

304
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:46,799
pest inspections she's sending folks to

305
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,640
do those for her

306
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:50,559
uh so she's gonna try to grow every

307
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:52,078
single one of them uh but if you all

308
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:54,319
wanna try to connect i think that would

309
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:55,919
be very fun too maybe do some crosses

310
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,639
for future grow-off projects that would

311
00:11:55,919 --> 00:12:00,799
be very fun yeah yeah that's my favorite

312
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:02,399
part about this and it's cool to get the

313
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:04,479
contestants too

314
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,240
it's just interlinking with everybody

315
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,480
it's a good way to find genetics is just

316
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,799
working with the people that are growing

317
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,720

00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,240
area if

373
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:07,919
if that's what you want to call it

374

pretty much because it's you know like a

375
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:12,399
maryland dc

376
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:14,720
virginia thing so um we're all connected

377
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:17,600
it's a lot of good growers out here

378
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,959
um a lot of good genetics as well so

379
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,959
it's exciting

380
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:22,319
to just be a part of this little family

381
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:24,719
right here

382
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,800
and uh see how things go so um

383
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,278
especially with la hepha she's

384
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:32,000
i've been growing her for four years now

385
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:34,320
so i've i've got her really dialed in uh

386
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,799
so that picture was uh

387
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:39,440
like right at its peak where she's been

388
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:41,439
amazing you know i mean just uh

389
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,440
getting a lot of clones off for her

390
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,560
trying to like branch her out a lot but

391
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,560
um

392
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:48,159
he has just been amazing man this whole

393
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:50,159
thing is uh i'm excited for it

394
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:51,679
especially for virginia because i know

395
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:53,759
here it's

396
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:55,759
it's a lot of low-key folks out here but

397
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:57,198
they've been growing for a minute but

398
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:59,120
for me i think it's time for them to

399
00:14:57,198 --> 00:15:02,159
just come out and have some fun

400
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:05,039

406
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:18,639
maine i believe wait hold up one second

407
00:15:17,198 --> 00:15:21,278
i was muted i was trying to get your

408
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:23,278
attention so hit up lou

409
00:15:21,278 --> 00:15:24,399

yeah we're yes i'm talking to lou we're

413
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:34,719
hoping to collab on a gene traders uh at

414
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:37,278
the virginia clone drop for the grow off

415
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:39,440
so that would be extra special it would

416
00:15:37,278 --> 00:15:41,679
just require a little bit more space and

417
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:44,959
420 friendly venue where we're just need

418
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:46,638
to hand out clones so yes thank you ross

419
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:48,000
uh and if any and i'm assuming we have a

420
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:49,440
lot of growers watching if you don't

421
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,600
know what a gene traders event is

422
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,279
they're awesome it's a pop-up seed and

423
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,278
clone event where you can just get the

424
00:15:53,278 --> 00:15:57,679
latest and greatest in genetics they're

425
00:15:55,278 --> 00:16:01,120
all over the country and they're awesome

426

438
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:37,680
us i guess i've been playing with this

439
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:40,399
plant for about 25 years pretty

440
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:42,159
seriously did a couple breeds for

441
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:46,480
some outdoor folks here in maine since

442
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:46,480
we have such short seasons and

443
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:51,278
wet finishes they really have to be some

444
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:52,879
early finishers and very hardy plants so

445
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:55,039
that was kind of like my first

446
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:56,799
addition on my what i was trying to

447
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:58,799
breed for this area

448
00:16:56,799 --> 00:17:01,359
and kind of threw together some really

449
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:03,359
depo g lines with the fotea stuff um

450
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,279
came to this farm kind of started a new

451
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,199
awakening and passion for this plan

452
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:09,519
after taking about a good year off um

453
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:11,679
before we got the 7200 square foot spot

454
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:14,480
i'm up and ready to go so now we're

455
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:18,679
excited because we just popped about 700

456
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,679
plus seeds and just

457
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:24,720
do the

458
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,720
fur

459
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,640
see

460
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,840
oh wi-fi that's the mix of

461
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,640
oh i must have lost it huh

462
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:46,400
yeah

463
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:49,759
we lost you at the 700 seeds

464
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:51,200
oh yeah so now uh with this 700c project

465
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:53,038
hopefully this will give everybody a

466
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,960
good view into what we're working with

467
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:57,038
moving forward

468
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:59,120
um so the selection that we'll be using

469
00:17:57,038 --> 00:18:01,119
will be from that 700 plus seed hunt so

470
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:03,359
we're really excited to see what this uh

471
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:05,918
results should be because uh we're

472
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:07,918
really fresh and working with it now as

473
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:10,000
it is so um

474
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:12,320
we'll be you know pushing these strains

475
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,679
moving forward so i think it'll be fun

476
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:15,839
to see the test results and see how

477
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:18,400
people deal with them

478
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:18,399
oh yeah

479
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:22,719
100 percent

480
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:25,599
yeah johnny get anything bad

481
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:27,839
no i mean for me it's kind of like

482
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:30,159
obviously i started smoking really young

483
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:32,240
started slinging um originally from

484
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,480
boston started slinging packs in college

485
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:37,038
so kind of giving the kids

486
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,720
in the area something good um

487
00:18:37,038 --> 00:18:40,879
used to go up to maine to grab the stuff

488
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,038
it ended up moving up there

489
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:45,200
kind of um

490
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:47,759
passionate about the plant so ended up

491
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:51,120
hooking up with jason and we just

492
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:52,798
you know this is our passion project and

493
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:55,038
we've taken our time for the last two

494
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:56,960
years building the place out making sure

495
00:18:55,038 --> 00:18:57,839
everything was done right

496
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,759
and

497
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:01,199
you know making the decision to pop the

498
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:02,480
seeds was the best thing we ever did

499
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,558
because we didn't have to worry about

500
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,960
anything going around

501
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:09,918
um and we don't have to worry about

502
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,759
taking anyone's cuts into to get going

503
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:13,600
and then end up with a virus or bugs or

504
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:15,119
anything like that so it was a good

505
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:17,519
decision we're just excited to kind of

506
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:19,359
be part of this thing right and um

507
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:21,440
you know june 25th at urban garden

508
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:23,119
centers in maine we're gonna

509
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:26,720
have an awesome drop so we're looking

510
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:26,719
forward to it seeing what everyone grows

511
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,440
perfect thank you guys so much and then

512
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:36,559
i'm right after maine i'm scooting right

513
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:38,960
down to massachusetts uh but i will say

514
00:19:36,558 --> 00:19:41,759
our main sign ups i know there are like

515
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:43,679
thousands of growers in maine uh i don't

516
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:46,079
know where they're at yet so we gotta

517
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:47,679
hustle some some mainers out to pick

518
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:49,759
these cuts up so

519
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:51,440
yeah maybe some more post and marketing

520
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:52,879
on our end and we can get them things

521
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,000
kicked up

522
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,320
perfect

523
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,679
so yeah absolutely

524
00:19:56,319 --> 00:19:59,918
maine's been bugging us to come there

525
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:02,880
for years so this should be a good

526
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:05,200
turnout once they uh get signed up and

527
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,640
everything so after maine i'm scooting

528
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,319
right down to

529
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,400
worcester mass

530
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:12,639
uh where our breeder

531
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:16,559
fat cat select seeds is providing the

532
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,559
cut this year welcome travis

533
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,839
job i think you're muted

534
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:25,200
you're muted travis

535
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:33,279
oh there you go is that better

536
00:20:30,798 --> 00:20:35,839
yeah so like kim said i'm travis from

537
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:38,798
fat cat select seeds uh my brother ian

538
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:40,798
and i uh do all the breeding the whole

539
00:20:38,798 --> 00:20:42,400
everything right from start to finish we

540
00:20:40,798 --> 00:20:44,319
um

541
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,880
we called it select seeds because we

542
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:48,879
actually um individually look at every

543
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,000
single seed before we sell and package

544
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,240
them

545
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,240
so they've been all hand selected every

546
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,159
single one

547
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,319
so to get to a brief history

548
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:01,039
we grew up on martha's vineyard

549
00:20:58,319 --> 00:21:03,599
which is an island off the coast

550
00:21:01,038 --> 00:21:05,440
we've been isolated for years and years

551
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:07,519
and years away from the rest of the

552
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:10,400
world really for genetics

553
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:12,798
um and we still are uh really out here

554
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,840
um people really don't know what's going

555
00:21:12,798 --> 00:21:17,440
on with the new strains

556
00:21:14,839 --> 00:21:20,158
anything that's happening out there with

557
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,679
the popularity so um

558
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:23,280
things have kind of evolved a little

559
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:25,200
differently out here

560
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:27,678
i could say from the beginning of

561
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,200
breeding it's been growing up wasn't me

562
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:30,798
who started it was the previous

563
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,279
generation

564
00:21:30,798 --> 00:21:36,400
who showed me how to um

565
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:40,158
make seeds at a young age how to um

566
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:42,640
select the better plants how to um

567
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:44,559
you know pick the best ones and go

568
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:47,038
forward with them so

569
00:21:44,558 --> 00:21:48,798
so we've always been interested in uh

570
00:21:47,038 --> 00:21:50,879
breeding genetics uh right from the

571
00:21:48,798 --> 00:21:53,440
beginning not only in cannabis

572
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:55,760
i've done breeding in other fruits

573
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:58,558
vegetables and things like that

574
00:21:55,759 --> 00:21:59,440
um so cannabis has always been very fun

575
00:21:58,558 --> 00:22:01,839
though

576
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:04,480
and something that out here um

577
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:06,079
genetics were very hard to come by

578
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,240
um so

579
00:22:06,079 --> 00:22:10,720
you collected them as best you could you

580
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:12,798
uh when you found something you saved it

581
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,880
uh you tried to keep your clones you

582
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:17,200
tried to keep your seeds as as best you

583
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,720
can because you do not want to lose them

584
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,798
because sometimes they're almost

585
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:23,038
impossible to replace

586
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:26,240
uh now that you know things have changed

587
00:22:23,038 --> 00:22:29,038
a little bit we can access strains and

588
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:30,319
clones through these places all over the

589
00:22:29,038 --> 00:22:34,000
world um

590
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:35,759
it's a lot easier with legalization and

591
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,359
with the way things are going

592
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:38,960
uh so you know right from the beginning

593
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:41,038
of legalization we were interested in

594
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,960
having our strains tested it's the first

595
00:22:41,038 --> 00:22:44,879
thing we did we wanted to know what we

596
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:47,679
were growing we wanted to know what our

597
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,559
thc percentages were what our terpenes

598
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:50,960
were

599
00:22:48,558 --> 00:22:53,200
we wanted to know what plants we liked

600
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,798
uh what we didn't why we liked them

601
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,400
there were some plants you know you just

602
00:22:54,798 --> 00:22:58,319
don't know what terpenes are in them

603
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,240
until you have them tested and when you

604
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:02,639
do then you know

605
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,519
uh which is why uh you know the grow-off

606
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,480
is

607
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:09,918
really really a great competition it's

608
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:12,640
really in in reality the greatest

609
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:14,720
phenotype hunt of all uh considering

610
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:17,280
that the phenotype is just the um

611
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:19,519
environmental expressions of the plant

612
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:22,240
so each individual clone would be the

613
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:24,240
genotype but the phenotype is up to each

614
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,839
individual grower to create on their own

615
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:29,038
through their fertilizer and their grow

616
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:31,439
rooms uh so it's the ultimate contest

617
00:23:29,038 --> 00:23:34,240
really the the top that you could do to

618
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,200
be a grower um people say phenotype hunt

619
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,279
but

620
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,159
fido time pun is really

621
00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:40,960
um

622
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:42,400
the same clone grown differently uh when

623
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,960
you're searching through seeds it's

624
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:47,278
really a genotype hunt but um

625
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:49,519
it's really just a common word that's

626
00:23:47,278 --> 00:23:50,400
kind of misconception

627
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:52,079
so

628
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,080
um you know

629
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:57,119
creating genotypes

630
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:59,678
is uh what we do what we look for um

631
00:23:57,119 --> 00:24:02,399
we take uh basically look to create uh

632
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:05,278
what we call apex strains

633
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:08,120
uh an apex strain i would consider

634
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:10,400
a strain that uh best represents the

635
00:24:08,119 --> 00:24:12,319
characteristics of

636
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:14,960
uh whatever you're looking to do say

637
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:17,519
it's a blueberry or bubble gum

638
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:19,919
uh you're looking to make the best best

639
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:21,759
tasting best characteristics of

640
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:23,278
blueberry that you can find and it may

641
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:24,879
not be

642
00:24:23,278 --> 00:24:27,038
everybody's favorite

643
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:29,520
uh that's where the breeder comes in uh

644
00:24:27,038 --> 00:24:32,400
the breeder picks his favorite and uh

645
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:35,278
when a breeder gets a reputation locally

646
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:37,919
or wherever people trust in your nose

647
00:24:35,278 --> 00:24:40,720
your what you pick what you like for

648
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:43,200
your plants so you get a following and

649
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:45,038
um that's really how it started with uh

650
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,720
fat cat and breeding

651
00:24:45,038 --> 00:24:48,879
was um

652
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,679
a following of people and wanting to

653
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,720
make

654
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:54,880
better strains

655
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,960
and ones that were true to how you

656
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,640
wanted them to taste if i bought

657
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:01,440
blueberry seeds i want them to taste

658
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:03,440
like blueberry and good blueberry and if

659
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,919
i buy bubble gum it should taste like

660
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:08,480
bubble gum so uh i really like the

661
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:11,520
classic strains creating them recreating

662
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:13,759
them and uh trying to make them um as

663
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:15,038
best as we can

664
00:25:13,759 --> 00:25:16,000
so

665
00:25:15,038 --> 00:25:18,798
sam

666
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,558

00:26:02,798 --> 00:26:06,558
just seeing this over and over again in

689
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:08,080
the cannabis industry this really cool

690
00:26:06,558 --> 00:26:09,839
connection whether it's instagram or

691
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:11,119
whatever about all coming together that

692
00:26:09,839 --> 00:26:15,278
used to be

693
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:17,199
old smugglers old growers old breeders

694
00:26:15,278 --> 00:26:18,400
all that good stuff it's super fun and

695
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,240
um

696
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,440
it's just such a euphoric life nowadays

697
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,120
it's really cool

698
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,400
i'm in hawaii we're kind of stuck in

699
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:26,479
time a little bit but we're getting

700
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,519
there we're still at a stacking license

701
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,038
kind of

702
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:31,359
formula so

703
00:26:29,038 --> 00:26:34,079
you can grow 10 plants per person

704
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:35,839
and there's no limit to where you can

705
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:37,519
how many plants how many cards you can

706
00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:39,038
have at a site

707
00:26:37,519 --> 00:26:40,480
they've tried to control that and try to

708
00:26:39,038 --> 00:26:42,240
regulate it and try to enforce it but

709
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,200
it's never worked so we've officially

710
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,120
become

711
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,600
the largest patient-based farm in hawaii

712
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:48,959
with over 2000 patients on our farm

713
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:50,240
it's happening because we have

714
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,360
dispensaries that are open that aren't

715
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,679
providing

716
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:55,839
affordable medicine good medicine and

717
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:59,038
access to medicine for medical patients

718
00:26:55,839 --> 00:27:01,038
so uh that's where we came along and

719
00:26:59,038 --> 00:27:03,200
you know started rolling with the

720
00:27:01,038 --> 00:27:05,200
affordable ounce we call it the 150

721
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:07,038
onion so kind of exciting

722
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,880
um and then we bring you know blueberry

723
00:27:07,038 --> 00:27:10,879
back into the picture and

724
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,480
man a good blueberry is hard to beat man

725
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,559
i remember i was in vancouver about 10

726
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,558
years ago when mark emery was kind of

727
00:27:14,558 --> 00:27:18,158
doing his thing and there was a lot of

728
00:27:16,558 --> 00:27:19,678
short blueberry around man and when you

729
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:20,880
hit that thing man you better hold on

730
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:24,640
man that thing would just kind of get

731
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:26,559
you all like whoa reset so very excited

732
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:28,399
um we reached out to sam the girl off

733
00:27:26,558 --> 00:27:30,960
because we're just trying to get people

734
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:32,719
connected here empowered

735
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,399
working with policy makers getting the

736
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,480
growers out of the closet to recognize

737
00:27:34,398 --> 00:27:37,439
that hey if we don't do something here

738
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,880
we're going to run into a lot of

739
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,720
problems other states are having where

740
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,240
their big business is going to take over

741
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,759
and control our growth sites and stuff

742
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,839
like that so we're moving pretty fast

743
00:27:43,759 --> 00:27:47,599
here and i think we're doing a good job

744
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:48,798
we're we're lobbying you know what i

745
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:52,398
mean that's what we're doing and we're

746
00:27:48,798 --> 00:27:55,679
trying to open up thousands of local

747
00:27:52,398 --> 00:27:57,439
based cooperatives rosin makers

748
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:58,720
everything around here and we're just

749
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,720
following maine that's what we're trying

750
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,159
to do right now so i'm trying to throw

751
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,759
maine on them as hard as we can we have

752
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:05,600
a medical program here

753
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:07,599
it's pretty much a failure it was

754
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:08,879
established in the year 2000 i don't

755
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:11,359
know if you guys do but hawaii was the

756
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:13,278
first place to pass medical cannabis and

757
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:14,839
the last place to get dispensaries 16

758
00:28:13,278 --> 00:28:17,519
years later so it's always been a

759
00:28:14,839 --> 00:28:19,359
conundrum um but yeah so we met sam and

760
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:20,960
we just i said hey well let's just try

761
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:23,678
and get a little grow-off going here and

762
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:26,240
see what we can do in oahu

763
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:28,480
i'm not a breeder i have bread many

764
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:30,079
times before but i would definitely not

765
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:32,720
call myself a breeder i'm definitely a

766
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:34,720
grower we have about a 20 000 square

767
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,839
foot site here without like i said 2 000

768
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,120
patients

769
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:39,599
um

770
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:42,239
my grow-off kind of plant and what we're

771
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:43,599
going with was a humbling experience by

772
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:46,720
meeting um

773
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:48,240
king lancelot the eighth which was uh uh

774
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,000
in the eighth generation of king

775
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,359
kamehameha that was still alive and he

776
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,240
passed away a couple years ago from

777
00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:55,519
cancer and handed me some seeds

778
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,278
i can't tell you what they were because

779
00:28:55,519 --> 00:28:59,278
then i'll give it away

780
00:28:57,278 --> 00:29:01,599
but um there was some special stuff in

781
00:28:59,278 --> 00:29:03,919
it so we ran about 100 seeds we found

782
00:29:01,599 --> 00:29:06,079
some really cool old-school stuff in it

783
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:07,360
some blueberry and some cheesy stuff and

784
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:10,398
so that's kind of what we're going right

785
00:29:07,359 --> 00:29:12,558
now we're going to try and run

786
00:29:10,398 --> 00:29:14,719
those clones and then kind of like and

787
00:29:12,558 --> 00:29:16,240
in memory of king lancelot so that's

788
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,319
kind of how we're rolling with it and uh

789
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,278
we're really excited it's definitely an

790
00:29:18,319 --> 00:29:21,119
old

791
00:29:19,278 --> 00:29:22,798
mercene pinene

792
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:24,479
old school strain for sure there's

793
00:29:22,798 --> 00:29:26,480
something going on with it and uh i

794
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:28,240
haven't smelt that smell in a long time

795
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:30,640
so that's kind of what we're up to and

796
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:33,200
what we're excited about um

797
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:36,159
in a in a short story

798
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:39,200
that's i'm so excited jason's like

799
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:41,120
so good at just driving community around

800
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:43,360
just what he's doing and bringing

801
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:45,439
growers in and we're you're throwing a

802
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:48,319
party during our clone drop right so

803
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,320
that'll be fun and

804
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,480
yeah we do we try to run a couple uh

805
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:54,080
patient awareness days or patient

806
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,759
appreciation days because the patients

807
00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:57,439
are what makes our site

808
00:29:55,759 --> 00:29:59,278
it's just been insane you guys seeing

809
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:01,440
people come to the gate and just saying

810
00:29:59,278 --> 00:30:03,839
hey we don't have access to medicine and

811
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:05,200
we're like here you go and

812
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:07,119
now we've got a lot of great things on

813
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:09,038
our side you know we don't see

814
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:11,278
crazy narcotics compliance checks it's

815
00:30:09,038 --> 00:30:13,200
all gone now so we've really found the

816
00:30:11,278 --> 00:30:15,119
right people the right lawyers the right

817
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,798
lobbyists to really take control of this

818
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:18,879
and start driving in the right direction

819
00:30:16,798 --> 00:30:20,319
so people are not suffering you know

820
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,679
what i mean there's

821
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:23,038
there's so you know

822
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:24,559
i'm sure a lot of you guys started like

823
00:30:23,038 --> 00:30:25,839
i did just growing we for our friends

824
00:30:24,558 --> 00:30:27,839
and having fun and really not

825
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:30,240
understanding maybe in my opinion the

826
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:31,678
whole medicinal effect of cannabis and

827
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:33,038
now that you start seeing people coming

828
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:34,559
through the gate that can't sleep at

829
00:30:33,038 --> 00:30:36,398
night and doing this and doing that and

830
00:30:34,558 --> 00:30:38,398
trying to find a remedy for them it's

831
00:30:36,398 --> 00:30:39,439
totally transformed me as a person and

832
00:30:38,398 --> 00:30:41,599
um

833
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:43,919
it's it's it's badass i mean it's just

834
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:46,240
exciting and um and it gives you a lot

835
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:48,480
of leverage to kind of go back to the

836
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:50,000
people the lobbyists in our state or the

837
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,919
politicians in our state that are still

838
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,440
stuck in the reefer madness world and

839
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:55,440
just going hey you're looking at it all

840
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,960
the wrong way you got people suffering

841
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:59,440
out here and you need to move quickly

842
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:00,798
you know and so yeah we do not on

843
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,840
tangent but we do we did our first

844
00:31:00,798 --> 00:31:04,720

845
00:31:01,839 --> 00:31:06,639

it was

850
00:31:12,798 --> 00:31:15,359
you know how it is you guys when you get

851
00:31:14,079 --> 00:31:16,558
these things together and they're safe

852
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:18,959
and sound and people walking around with

853

all welcome man it's really you know i'm

889
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:30,559
very familiar with a lot of the breeders

890
00:32:29,038 --> 00:32:32,398
on this uh

891
00:32:30,558 --> 00:32:33,759
podcast right now and a lot of new ones

892
00:32:32,398 --> 00:32:34,798
and you guys see what's happening you

893
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:36,720
got to have

894
00:32:34,798 --> 00:32:38,639
breeders you can trust that you can get

895
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:41,278
clones and seed from

896
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:42,720
the seed industry is just out of control

897
00:32:41,278 --> 00:32:44,640
so it's nice that we're all starting to

898
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:45,759
wrap up and kind of gain energy together

899
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:48,240
so we get

900
00:32:45,759 --> 00:32:50,158
legitimacy and saying hey you know this

901
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:52,240
is the real deal we i got it right here

902
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:53,039
you know just like whether it's a cut

903
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,640
from

904
00:32:53,038 --> 00:32:55,919
mendo or you know you're it's really

905
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,519
exciting you know what i mean so we're

906
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:59,120
we're excited we love bringing genetics

907
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:01,278
in there's definitely a lot of hawaii

908
00:32:59,119 --> 00:33:02,558
genetics but as you guys know cannabis

909
00:33:01,278 --> 00:33:06,000
didn't show up to hawaii until like the

910
00:33:02,558 --> 00:33:07,519
late 50s early 60s surfers vietnam vets

911
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,200
so you know all the strains are from

912
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:10,240
outside of hawaii

913
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,759
although they've been here for a little

914
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:14,399
while so there's still some hidden stuff

915
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:16,480
around you know and um and a lot of it

916
00:33:14,398 --> 00:33:18,239
lost as well and you'll hear every story

917
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,839
from someone here who grew as a kid i

918
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,599
mean this place is just

919
00:33:19,839 --> 00:33:23,678
a cannabis

920
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:25,199
kingdom it's amazing to see like talk to

921
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:26,399
people who are my age or older that were

922
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,480
growing

923
00:33:26,398 --> 00:33:30,319
durbin hash plant and sugarcane fields

924
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,839
in the 60s or 70s you know and you're

925
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:33,678
like what was that all about you know

926
00:33:31,839 --> 00:33:35,119
those seeds aren't around anymore but

927
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:36,399
you kind of kind of know probably what

928
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:38,719
they were fooling with with some of the

929
00:33:36,398 --> 00:33:40,239
old legends in place and the creators of

930
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,519
durban poison and some of the ghani's

931
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:43,120
that were being smuggled over here and

932
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:45,120
closed from back in the day from some of

933
00:33:43,119 --> 00:33:47,759
the legends so yeah it's really it's

934
00:33:45,119 --> 00:33:47,759
really exciting

935
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:52,000
cool all right well hopefully some of

936
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:54,480

953
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:26,240
see who won from all these awesome

954
00:34:25,039 --> 00:34:29,199
states

955
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:32,479
and someone had asked who can enter

956
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:34,960
and uh i i made a point in the last two

957
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:37,280
years to make sure we could uh open this

958
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:39,599
up to homegrow caregivers not just

959
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:41,519
commercial farms we originally started

960
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:43,440
it was just commercial and then realized

961
00:34:41,519 --> 00:34:46,159
that you know the homegrown caregiver

962
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:48,480
market is huge and a lot of them want

963
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:50,240
employment in the industry and so

964
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,599
by going through a grow off and some of

965
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:54,398
them don't which is totally fine but

966
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:57,440
they also grow fire weed so we figured

967
00:34:54,398 --> 00:34:59,519
um if we can get the homegrown market

968
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:02,960
participating they have a resume item if

969
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:04,320
they win and then uh they can kind of

970
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:06,000
move themselves up in the industry if

971
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:08,160
they choose to but they are also their

972
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,239
test scores are off the charts so

973
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:12,639
uh in i think every single one of these

974
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:15,598
states homegrown caregiver is open

975
00:35:12,639 --> 00:35:17,679
uh depending on metric transfer stuff

976
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:18,800
commercial might not be available in

977
00:35:17,679 --> 00:35:21,440
your state

978
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:24,240
um so yeah val you should definitely

979
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:26,079
enter because uh homegrow is available

980
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:27,759
in all of the states that we're in this

981
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:30,300
year

982
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:31,599
so what should we chat about boys

983
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:33,760
[Laughter]

984
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:35,440
um what questions we had a question

985
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:38,880
about how many males you go through

986
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:40,320
before you choose one to breed with

987
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:44,519
and i know

988
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:44,519
there we go okay thank you

989
00:35:46,159 --> 00:35:50,239
you go through until you find what

990
00:35:47,838 --> 00:35:53,039
you're looking for

991
00:35:50,239 --> 00:35:53,039
how many do you have

992
00:35:53,679 --> 00:35:57,759
a thousand thousand

993
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:59,440
all day got the space and the time

994
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:01,599
you'll see it when you know like that

995
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:03,519
structure that stem rub

996
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:05,200
um you know they'll just the way the

997
00:36:03,519 --> 00:36:07,759
leaf the complexion of the leaf the

998
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:09,679
waxiness of the plant you can see like

999
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:12,000
how like the plant health overall based

1000
00:36:09,679 --> 00:36:13,598
on how you're feeding people to kind of

1001
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,920
dictate what sort of expressions you

1002
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:18,240
might be able to pull out of it too so

1003
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:20,159
um and always like i always just try and

1004
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:22,000
make sure that people finish those mails

1005
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:23,759
like don't just wait until they drop but

1006
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,280
see what they do when they're done you

1007
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:27,359
know

1008
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:29,760
but you don't have the space for it and

1009
00:36:27,358 --> 00:36:31,279
can't get it you know can't get it

1010
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,960
segregated from any place it shouldn't

1011
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:35,200
have seeds in it obviously that's a

1012
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:37,358
little tough but

1013
00:36:35,199 --> 00:36:39,598
well i think if you have the opportunity

1014
00:36:37,358 --> 00:36:43,119
being able to see the male plant flower

1015
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:46,240
out to completion before you uh ever hit

1016
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:47,760
it to another girl really is a a really

1017
00:36:46,239 --> 00:36:49,358
beneficial thing

1018
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:51,599
there's a lot of things that you see

1019
00:36:49,358 --> 00:36:54,000
during that process that you don't see

1020
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:56,480
otherwise you don't see how the the

1021
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:59,440
plant expresses fire you don't see

1022
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:02,159
how the plant like really uh

1023
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:05,599
continues to to stack flowers unless you

1024
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:07,838
really run that male completion

1025
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:10,400
and i'm also a big firm believer of

1026
00:37:07,838 --> 00:37:12,799
putting them on revenge so let me finish

1027
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:15,519
and re-imagine them and you know you'll

1028
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:17,680
find out a lot about them too and bring

1029
00:37:15,519 --> 00:37:19,599
things and a lot of it comes down to

1030
00:37:17,679 --> 00:37:21,598
looking at the progeny and like what

1031
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:23,440
came out of that you know because like

1032
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:25,519
with the magnum opus breed so one of the

1033
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:27,760
magnum really pulled through every one

1034
00:37:25,519 --> 00:37:30,079
of the crosses there wasn't one real

1035
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,800
dominant female out of that group until

1036
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:33,359
i

1037
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:36,079
selected fur for a male that would

1038
00:37:33,358 --> 00:37:38,799
actually pass those straight so um that

1039
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:40,320
really kind of you know time effort and

1040
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:42,480
your dedication to what you're really

1041
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:44,400
looking for you know well that's the

1042
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:47,119
thing none of us can read the future and

1043
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:48,800
so like if you don't watch the project

1044
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:51,119
and you don't see which trades are

1045
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,960
dominant then you have no idea like what

1046
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:54,960
you were moving with in the first place

1047
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:56,720
it's a mystery pundit you know it's like

1048
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:58,400
there's so many different areas you

1049
00:37:56,719 --> 00:38:00,319
could go especially with the paulies and

1050
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:02,160
the hybrids out there just there's so

1051
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:04,160
much variation in recessive dominance

1052
00:38:02,159 --> 00:38:06,078
especially once you start talking about

1053
00:38:04,159 --> 00:38:07,838
felil generations and moving further

1054
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:09,440
into the line

1055
00:38:07,838 --> 00:38:11,599
i would definitely uh stress test as

1056
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:14,240
well with the certain strains like

1057
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:15,680
you don't want to hurt like the smallest

1058
00:38:14,239 --> 00:38:17,919
amount of stress will cause it to herman

1059
00:38:15,679 --> 00:38:19,199
then you'll pretty much promote that

1060
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,119
into the progeny into the next

1061
00:38:19,199 --> 00:38:23,279
generation so that's something that i

1062
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:24,880
want to promote into the next uh

1063
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,560
generation seeds so definitely stress

1064
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:29,838
testing more as well to like treat them

1065
00:38:26,559 --> 00:38:29,838
like shit absolute garbage

1066
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:34,000
well to me that is testing

1067
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,599
you know testing is treating them like

1068
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,358
shit and seeing what they can do with

1069
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:39,280
because at the end of the day

1070
00:38:37,358 --> 00:38:40,559
you know like you can be the best grower

1071
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,920
in the world and get my seeds or you can

1072
00:38:40,559 --> 00:38:43,519
be the worst grower in the world and get

1073
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,200
my seeds and i'm not gonna know what you

1074
00:38:43,519 --> 00:38:46,880
are i'm just gonna sell you the pack of

1075
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:49,279
seeds and then we're going to find out

1076
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:50,960
afterwards when you do your stress test

1077
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:53,280
yeah

1078
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:54,639
and not everybody's dialed in either you

1079
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:57,280
know you got to kind of play to the

1080
00:38:54,639 --> 00:38:58,799
environment and actually like you know

1081
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,800
look a little bit deeper than just how

1082
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:03,119
the plant reacted and maybe take a look

1083
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:04,720
at what you did to that plant through

1084
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:06,960
that situation

1085
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:08,639
like i'm not always look i feel like a

1086
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:10,240
lot of times people come up with excuses

1087
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:12,159
for the plant or why it didn't work for

1088
00:39:10,239 --> 00:39:14,479
them where they might you need to look

1089
00:39:12,159 --> 00:39:15,598
at why you didn't work for the plant you

1090
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:17,519
know

1091
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:19,680
and don't be afraid to throw stuff away

1092
00:39:17,519 --> 00:39:19,679
too

1093
00:39:21,039 --> 00:39:25,599
you know don't hang on to everything and

1094
00:39:23,199 --> 00:39:26,838
a lot of it you know it isn't special

1095
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:28,880
that they all are

1096
00:39:26,838 --> 00:39:30,480
special hang on them get attached to

1097
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:33,280
them you know if they're not always

1098
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:34,079
stronger if it's not no game changing

1099
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,000
like

1100
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:37,280
terpene profile or like yield or

1101
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,880
anything else like that then it's

1102
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:41,280
probably not worth keeping around like

1103
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:42,880
you only want it's like

1104
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:44,640
it's got to do all the things it's got a

1105
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:47,039
veg well it's got a clone well it's got

1106
00:39:44,639 --> 00:39:49,199
a flower well it's got to give badass

1107
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:50,960
bag appeal it's kind of smell good it's

1108
00:39:49,199 --> 00:39:53,439
got to get you higher than shit it's got

1109
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:54,720
to do it all sometimes

1110
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:57,119
and that doesn't mean that it's always

1111
00:39:54,719 --> 00:39:57,118
going to win

1112
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:13,920
of the profile it's smoke it's pretty

1113
00:40:11,838 --> 00:40:15,679
much like very hard grow but

1114
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:17,200
now everything should be completely

1115
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:18,799
viable straight for it to stick around

1116
00:40:17,199 --> 00:40:21,118
because it's a lot

1117
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:25,240
that aren't virtually probably

1118
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:25,240
gotta earn those terps

1119
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:32,800
beginning to know what you're looking

1120
00:40:30,239 --> 00:40:35,039
for if you don't know what you want what

1121
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:37,119
you want a question what you're looking

1122
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:39,199
for you're just looking to

1123
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:40,880
just choose the one that maybe impressed

1124
00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:42,960
you the best one of the bunch but if you

1125
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:45,440
know what you're looking for

1126
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:46,880
in your seat then you can hear you know

1127
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:48,079
to what to

1128
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:50,240
what to pick

1129
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:52,800
you know we use a method where we uh we

1130
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:55,439
grade every single plant

1131
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:58,240
we give it a one through ten score um we

1132
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:00,559
do it sometimes every two days we'll

1133
00:40:58,239 --> 00:41:03,039
give a score on its stock smell on its

1134
00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:05,440
leaf smell its resin production it's

1135
00:41:03,039 --> 00:41:08,159
mode spacing bigger in size

1136
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:09,599
it's resin smell it's flower size

1137
00:41:08,159 --> 00:41:11,759
compactness

1138
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:14,240
all of the different characteristics of

1139
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:17,040
the plant throughout its flower every

1140
00:41:14,239 --> 00:41:19,199
two days we'll give it a grade

1141
00:41:17,039 --> 00:41:20,800
by the end of the

1142
00:41:19,199 --> 00:41:23,598
flower you've got

1143
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:25,599
an average of 15 different ratings for

1144
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:27,920
each plant you average out all those

1145
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:30,160
grades

1146
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:33,119
the top one sticks out

1147
00:41:30,159 --> 00:41:36,318
guaranteed every time because you rated

1148
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:38,480
it maybe 10 times and it gets a 9 or 10

1149
00:41:36,318 --> 00:41:39,599
every time for smell and you know it

1150
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:44,119
gets uh

1151
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:44,119
you know a seven or eight foreign

1152
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:03,040
so be careful if you're a grower and

1153
00:42:01,199 --> 00:42:04,399
want to become a breeder because here's

1154
00:42:03,039 --> 00:42:07,039
your people right here giving you a

1155
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:07,039
warning man

1156
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:10,480
and you want to reach out to the feeders

1157
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:12,000
if you're a grower you want to get your

1158
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:14,159
stuff from the breeders you don't want

1159
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,519
to be a breeder grower and try to pull

1160
00:42:14,159 --> 00:42:17,279
that off because that is a lot of work

1161
00:42:15,519 --> 00:42:19,280
and that's what we've left i'm like no

1162
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:21,359
no no no no i'm reaching out to the

1163
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:22,560
breeders that's what they specialize in

1164
00:42:21,358 --> 00:42:24,239
that's what they're taking all the

1165
00:42:22,559 --> 00:42:26,480
meticulous notes and trying to find all

1166
00:42:24,239 --> 00:42:30,879
the great crosses and you will save

1167
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:30,880
yourself a lot of time and frustration

1168
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:45,039
so yeah no it's time and dedication

1169
00:42:43,838 --> 00:42:47,199
right there

1170
00:42:45,039 --> 00:42:49,440
it's a lot it's a long process and a lot

1171
00:42:47,199 --> 00:42:53,199
of heartache

1172
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:53,200
throwing a lot of crazy shit lately

1173
00:42:54,559 --> 00:42:58,960
people do what we got rid of

1174
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,960
they

1175
00:43:10,159 --> 00:43:13,920
you know it is you know we built the

1176
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:16,318
ferrari so now it's time to drive this

1177
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:18,800
thing and uh start making the hard

1178
00:43:16,318 --> 00:43:18,800
choices

1179
00:43:19,519 --> 00:43:23,759
guarantee that whatever you select is

1180
00:43:21,679 --> 00:43:24,719
going to find like almost gay change and

1181
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:26,880
so

1182
00:43:24,719 --> 00:43:26,879
when

1183
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:43,519
opus number 456 they're going to be like

1184
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:44,720
well that was the best of any one that

1185
00:43:43,519 --> 00:43:47,759
anybody could possibly find because they

1186
00:43:44,719 --> 00:43:47,759
went through that many seats

1187
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,559
only takes one but you got a lot to go

1188
00:43:54,318 --> 00:43:59,358
through to get there

1189
00:43:56,559 --> 00:44:00,239
and then the process of running backs

1190
00:43:59,358 --> 00:44:02,480
said

1191
00:44:00,239 --> 00:44:04,799
once that you want to keep you know and

1192
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:06,318
that's that's another year running back

1193
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:09,119
two to three times to know what you're

1194
00:44:06,318 --> 00:44:10,719
really working with you know oh here's a

1195
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:13,119
question that i've always had and wanted

1196
00:44:10,719 --> 00:44:14,399
to ask the readers but um do you guys

1197
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:16,400
find that

1198
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:18,960
you find your better expressions or

1199
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:23,000
truer expressions to your keys or it's

1200
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:23,000
from your clone testing

1201
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:27,838
anybody

1202
00:44:25,039 --> 00:44:29,440
i can see i feel like seed runs always

1203
00:44:27,838 --> 00:44:31,119
the best run but i feel like you get the

1204
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:33,440
honest expression when you're on your

1205
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:33,440
second

1206
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:38,800
like i've been third of just trying to

1207
00:44:36,559 --> 00:44:41,199
stay away from my seed my actual seed

1208
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:43,839
hunts and actually do my first clone

1209
00:44:41,199 --> 00:44:45,039
hunts as like the baseline for animation

1210
00:44:43,838 --> 00:44:46,719
well that's what you're gonna get in the

1211
00:44:45,039 --> 00:44:48,639
commercial garden you're never going to

1212
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:50,799
run that seed run again you know you

1213
00:44:48,639 --> 00:44:52,318
only get one shot at it so like if you

1214
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:54,000
don't have something that does good in

1215
00:44:52,318 --> 00:44:55,599
the clone generation then you're screwed

1216
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,119
afterwards

1217
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:59,519
and i've i've actually been i've

1218
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:02,000
actually been taking clones off of said

1219
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:03,679
seed plant running that first

1220
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,760
yeah yeah that's kind of what i've been

1221
00:45:03,679 --> 00:45:06,559
fine enough that worked really well for

1222
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:09,119
me

1223
00:45:06,559 --> 00:45:13,599
yeah yeah

1224
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:15,680
i've never been like 700 though

1225
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:18,960
that's mine that's what that's happening

1226
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:18,960
you can't keep 700

1227
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:35,440
too oh yeah i think he was just saying

1228
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:38,160
i'm holding all those clones back as the

1229
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:39,760
process goes so now now in this day and

1230
00:45:38,159 --> 00:45:41,759
age like you know we've got our tissue

1231
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:43,680
culture lab set up so i get this tissue

1232
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:45,839
culture everything and it takes up zero

1233
00:45:43,679 --> 00:45:47,118
floor space for me you know and then i

1234
00:45:45,838 --> 00:45:49,838
can just eliminate them out of the

1235
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:49,838
refrigerator

1236
00:45:51,838 --> 00:45:57,719
propagation like this much space like

1237
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,719
700 for you

1238
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:37,440
you know sometimes you should gotta

1239
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:40,838
trust if you're selling someone a six

1240
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:40,838
pack of seeds

1241
00:46:54,559 --> 00:46:58,799
absolutely i hundred percent trust in

1242
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:00,000
the genetics with a six pack of seeds

1243
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:03,440
they're gonna come up with something

1244
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:06,159
that's top top quality oh hands down you

1245
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:08,480
know we sweep 700 seeds those are 50

1246
00:47:06,159 --> 00:47:10,639
different strains

1247
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:12,960
yes you have one strain you know i mean

1248
00:47:10,639 --> 00:47:15,118
at 10 seeds you know if it's a quality

1249
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:16,159
cross and quality genetics

1250
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:17,680
you really

1251
00:47:16,159 --> 00:47:20,480
shouldn't have to go through that many

1252
00:47:17,679 --> 00:47:21,358
to get a really really really top top

1253
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:23,679
notch

1254
00:47:21,358 --> 00:47:25,920
now you i say that but you know i do

1255
00:47:23,679 --> 00:47:28,558
like three four five packs of some

1256
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:31,519
people's gear just to find like that one

1257
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:32,880
and they do exist like you're gonna find

1258
00:47:31,519 --> 00:47:35,358
you know out of every pack you're gonna

1259
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:38,079
find a good expression out of like 50 50

1260
00:47:35,358 --> 00:47:39,838
parents um maybe some of them other

1261
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:42,880
mother dominance or maybe some of the

1262
00:47:39,838 --> 00:47:44,799
males dominance but it really does you

1263
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:47,280
know we can we can sit here and say that

1264
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:49,920
you can find fire and impact but to find

1265
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:51,040
one that's going to hit all expression

1266
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:54,480
whether it's

1267
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:56,800
nose look um bag appeal smell taste

1268
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:58,559
growth rates veg like that's gonna take

1269
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:00,400
a little bit more digging than just one

1270
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:01,440
pack i don't care whose pack of seeds

1271
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:03,358
i'm going through

1272
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:05,200
it takes a while and you know when when

1273
00:48:03,358 --> 00:48:08,000
they go through a thousand seven hundred

1274
00:48:05,199 --> 00:48:10,318
seeds you guarantee you found a good one

1275
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:13,119
oh hell yeah well yeah i think one

1276
00:48:10,318 --> 00:48:14,400
thousand seed plant once in the past i

1277
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:16,800
found like

1278
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:18,880
10 expressions of 10 things

1279
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:21,440
you know like so there would be one

1280
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:24,720
phenotype or or one expression that i

1281
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:27,280
would see you know 20 times 100 times 50

1282
00:48:24,719 --> 00:48:28,799
times whatever but it would be like six

1283
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:30,880
or seven different things that i would

1284
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:32,640
see across the whole thousand and then

1285
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:34,318
it was really just about picking out of

1286
00:48:32,639 --> 00:48:36,558
those six and seven things which is the

1287
00:48:34,318 --> 00:48:38,558
winner of the six and seven

1288
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:40,960
yeah i think the point is that you're

1289
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:41,920
gonna find bomb scenes from a great

1290
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:43,760
breeder

1291
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:45,680
we can go back as early as reserve a

1292
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:47,839
providence

1293
00:48:45,679 --> 00:48:50,399
and stuff that sounds you get a 10-pack

1294
00:48:47,838 --> 00:48:52,078
of that man it's just like oh shit this

1295
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:54,639
is crazy you know what i mean just game

1296
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:56,400
changers so those were packs those

1297
00:48:54,639 --> 00:48:58,159
reserva packs you had six seeds and

1298
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:00,000
every one of them was the same

1299
00:48:58,159 --> 00:49:03,358
like there was some homogeneity in those

1300
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,358
facts like there were early

1301
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:20,639
really big specific strains go into the

1302
00:49:17,358 --> 00:49:22,400
world go to like f4 x5 whatever now it

1303
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:24,639
just seems because the end user's demand

1304
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:25,760
is changing so much if it doesn't

1305
00:49:24,639 --> 00:49:27,279
instagram

1306
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:28,960
if it doesn't load on instagram then

1307
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:30,480
they don't want it and it's like most

1308
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:32,800
people there's almost no one to take

1309
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:34,400
certain selections

1310
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:36,480
like that because people's demand keeps

1311
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:38,720
changing instagrams keeps instagram

1312
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:40,800
keeps making everybody's uh demand

1313
00:49:38,719 --> 00:49:43,199
change so fast by the time you work with

1314
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:43,200
strengths

1315
00:49:56,559 --> 00:50:00,559
and you can smell it and you can smoke

1316
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:02,559
it and it changes you so

1317
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:04,079
you gotta have like i don't know

1318
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:06,160
breeders just have to

1319
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:07,680
you have to be partly crazy because you

1320
00:50:06,159 --> 00:50:08,399
have to know that you're going on this

1321
00:50:07,679 --> 00:50:13,039
like

1322
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:13,039
10-year journey be an old-ass man yeah

1323
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:18,000
and so yeah just i it all depends on

1324
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:19,599
what you're

1325
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:22,000
trying to create because then it tells

1326
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:24,720
you if you need a million males or a

1327
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:26,400
hundred females or you know

1328
00:50:24,719 --> 00:50:28,399
you're doing acres or whatever you're

1329
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:30,400
looking for because sometimes you're

1330
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:31,519
looking for that really rare thing

1331
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:33,039
sometimes you're trying to improve your

1332
00:50:31,519 --> 00:50:35,519
consistency

1333
00:50:33,039 --> 00:50:38,400
yeah i like the 10 pack that's a pretty

1334
00:50:35,519 --> 00:50:40,719
fair way to look at though i don't know

1335
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,720
where

1336
00:50:52,159 --> 00:50:55,799
well that's

1337
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:09,359
for whatever reason that's what they

1338
00:51:08,639 --> 00:51:10,879
want

1339
00:51:09,358 --> 00:51:13,519
but at the end of the day the people

1340
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:14,680
that are on this hall are generally not

1341
00:51:13,519 --> 00:51:19,000
interested

1342
00:51:14,679 --> 00:51:19,000
in you know

1343
00:51:25,969 --> 00:51:33,489
[Laughter]

1344
00:51:34,239 --> 00:51:37,679
i think i think that's pretty cool too

1345
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:39,358
is when you get that pack and there's a

1346
00:51:37,679 --> 00:51:41,598
homogeneity that you know it's been done

1347
00:51:39,358 --> 00:51:43,920
right yeah you just know hey man

1348
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:45,760
i'm gonna ban her back i'm getting this

1349
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:47,039
i know i'm gonna get something right

1350
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:49,359
you know i mean that's what you know

1351
00:51:47,039 --> 00:51:50,800
people are watching this be careful who

1352
00:51:49,358 --> 00:51:52,960
you're working with and how you're

1353
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:54,079
selecting seeds the market's wide open

1354
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:55,599
right now and i think it's the most

1355
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:58,079
important part of bringing the peers

1356
00:51:55,599 --> 00:52:01,200
together to go hey who's who's doing

1357
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:02,318
what and who put the time in so they get

1358
00:52:01,199 --> 00:52:05,118
you know

1359
00:52:02,318 --> 00:52:06,480
paid properly and um

1360
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:10,599
you know announced properly you know

1361
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:10,599
what i mean that's that's important

1362
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:24,480
you know and to get purple to breed in

1363
00:52:22,318 --> 00:52:28,199
the reds we just came out with a brand

1364
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:28,199
new red flower

1365
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:44,759
we are all crazy

1366
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:50,719
and uh we're also uh holders and

1367
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:54,440
protectors of the seats so we all have

1368
00:52:50,719 --> 00:52:54,439
to have those i mean

1369
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:31,280
and we should definitely think about

1370
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:33,920
um

1371
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:36,319
what we can do together the swap or you

1372
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:39,039
know some shit for next year's girl offs

1373
00:53:36,318 --> 00:53:43,079
and the next year's after that

1374
00:53:39,039 --> 00:53:43,079
i think that would be really cool

1375
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:56,318
you know like i can't wait to see where

1376
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:59,318
this actually goes in the next 5-10

1377
00:53:56,318 --> 00:53:59,318

1393
00:55:22,239 --> 00:55:25,919
like you said you know we don't have any

1394

00:55:37,838 --> 00:55:43,519
incarceration entries get 50 off a 50

1402
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:45,759
entry fee like i just want as many

1403
00:55:43,519 --> 00:55:47,679
people doing this as possible because

1404
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:49,359
you can see just from like the genetic

1405
00:55:47,679 --> 00:55:51,440
side of things this is a community

1406
00:55:49,358 --> 00:55:53,039
that's what we do is get growers

1407
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:54,960
together within their own communities

1408
00:55:53,039 --> 00:55:57,358
and then you know connect state to state

1409
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:59,838
until it's federally legal and then we

1410
00:55:57,358 --> 00:56:01,679
can do one all together you know the

1411
00:55:59,838 --> 00:56:04,159
the conglomerate that you guys all make

1412
00:56:01,679 --> 00:56:06,078
together from all the different strains

1413
00:56:04,159 --> 00:56:08,318
everybody knows seeds are federally

1414
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:10,318
legal right so we can now

1415
00:56:08,318 --> 00:56:12,000
the mail you can send them the u.s

1416
00:56:10,318 --> 00:56:15,119
postal service you can bring the

1417
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:16,719
campaigns on votes fly with them i do

1418
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:19,280
that every day i really never did that i

1419
00:56:16,719 --> 00:56:19,279
did before

1420
00:56:20,639 --> 00:56:25,279
never done it probably for 20 years

1421
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:29,119
the u.s postal service is the biggest

1422
00:56:27,679 --> 00:56:31,598
drug dealer

1423
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:33,440
yeah let's let's remember all of our

1424
00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:35,119
badass growers are incarcerated right

1425
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:38,318
now too so let's get them out of there

1426
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:38,318
yeah yeah all day

1427
00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:43,358
what

1428
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,199
peter do we have any other questions

1429
00:56:43,358 --> 00:56:47,838
that came through i wasn't quite

1430
00:56:45,199 --> 00:56:50,239
yeah let me just mute uh

1431
00:56:47,838 --> 00:56:51,920
i'm gonna mute everyone for a second and

1432
00:56:50,239 --> 00:56:55,439
then uh all right so

1433
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:58,240
evidently the audio is a little better

1434
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:59,679
and uh as i was joking the the people on

1435
00:56:58,239 --> 00:57:01,039
youtube probably didn't appreciate it

1436
00:56:59,679 --> 00:57:03,598
but i was like it sounds great in the

1437
00:57:01,039 --> 00:57:03,599
stream yard

1438
00:57:03,838 --> 00:57:06,400
um

1439
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:12,880
yeah i i think well

1440
00:57:09,358 --> 00:57:15,358
from me i mean the the first two people

1441
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:17,358
uh kind of talked about like themselves

1442
00:57:15,358 --> 00:57:19,039
uh like they're kind of intent as

1443
00:57:17,358 --> 00:57:21,598
breeders and kind of if we could just

1444
00:57:19,039 --> 00:57:24,159
quickly go around everyone else and

1445

1475
00:58:26,639 --> 00:58:31,440
project has always been to breed for

1476
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:33,920
hash so we we breed mostly for terpenes

1477
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:36,960
and uh secondary cannabinoids

1478
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:38,318

into uh

1480
00:58:38,318 --> 00:58:43,199
extracts is is really what what our

1481
00:58:40,719 --> 00:58:45,118
interest level has been for for the last

1482
00:58:43,199 --> 00:58:47,358
many years um

1483
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:50,079
and so you know a lot of our a lot of

1484
00:58:47,358 --> 00:58:53,519
our stuff has lots of cbd and cvg and

1485
00:58:50,079 --> 00:58:55,359
thcva and things like that and and has a

1486
00:58:53,519 --> 00:58:57,199
minor cannabinoids and then there

1487
00:58:55,358 --> 00:58:59,279
there's a lot of interesting turpoint

1488
00:58:57,199 --> 00:59:00,078
there are terpenes and flavonoids that

1489
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:01,839
come

1490
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:03,839
in our stuff too so that we can make

1491
00:59:01,838 --> 00:59:06,239
better

1492
00:59:03,838 --> 00:59:09,199
and when you do smoke hash what kind of

1493
00:59:06,239 --> 00:59:11,279
flavor profiles do you personally like

1494
00:59:09,199 --> 00:59:13,039
in hash i like fruit

1495
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:14,400
in weed i like gas

1496
00:59:13,039 --> 00:59:17,440
so you know it kind of depends on what

1497
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:19,519
i'm going for but um you know that is

1498
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:23,519
especially rosins and things lemons and

1499
00:59:19,519 --> 00:59:23,519
berries are are where it's at for me

1500
00:59:27,519 --> 00:59:32,079
it's my turn

1501
00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:33,519
so one of my favorite terps is that the

1502
00:59:32,079 --> 00:59:35,760
question

1503
00:59:33,519 --> 00:59:38,798
no just kind of what i mean that's part

1504
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:41,119
of it but kind of what what do you breed

1505
00:59:38,798 --> 00:59:43,679
for like what do you like to explore and

1506
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:47,760
focus on in your projects and then

1507
00:59:43,679 --> 00:59:49,519
personally what do you like smoking

1508
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:51,680
so currently right now i have uh

1509
00:59:49,519 --> 00:59:52,639
spritzer that was the 2020 grow off

1510
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:54,879
strain

1511
00:59:52,639 --> 00:59:56,960
that is a strain that i'm in the process

1512
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:59,039
of making a feminized seeds from so i

1513
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:00,960
reverse the spritzer and i'm going to

1514
00:59:59,039 --> 01:00:02,639
make a bunch of new crosses but what i

1515
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:05,039
had in mind for this was uh making a

1516
01:00:02,639 --> 01:00:07,838
hash line like spritz is known to wash

1517
01:00:05,039 --> 01:00:09,679
like around six or seven percent return

1518
01:00:07,838 --> 01:00:11,440
with some crazy high return on the press

1519
01:00:09,679 --> 01:00:13,039
so i pretty much wanted to

1520
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:15,679
make a line that's going to be pretty

1521
01:00:13,039 --> 01:00:18,079
much hash washers unique tert profiles

1522
01:00:15,679 --> 01:00:19,440
breeding strains specifically for

1523
01:00:18,079 --> 01:00:21,119
connoisseurs

1524
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:23,599
the aficionados the cannabis

1525
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:25,920
cognoscentis out there i kind of wanted

1526
01:00:23,599 --> 01:00:28,000
to do some a little bit of both like the

1527
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:30,798
cookies to cookies and then the cookies

1528
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:32,960
cross the non-cookie stuff like oh geez

1529
01:00:30,798 --> 01:00:35,358
and chems and sours and stuff like that

1530
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:36,240
skittles so try and get some different

1531
01:00:35,358 --> 01:00:39,279
uh

1532
01:00:36,239 --> 01:00:40,879
new terps in the mix right now the most

1533
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:42,000
anticipated one that i got right now at

1534
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:43,920
the top two is probably like the

1535
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:45,920
hazelnut cream to spritzer and then the

1536
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:48,159
african hazel eleven disperser that

1537
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:50,639
african haze 11 if you have never tried

1538
01:00:48,159 --> 01:00:52,960
that that's from uh bronson farms one of

1539
01:00:50,639 --> 01:00:55,358
my favorite hazes period like an 11 12

1540
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:56,960
week haze but this is like amazing

1541
01:00:55,358 --> 01:00:59,519
flavor like if you ever heard a pif or

1542
01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:01,440
had any kind of pif terps definitely

1543
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:03,920
you'd like the african haze 11 so that

1544
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:05,838
cross to the spritzer should definitely

1545
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:06,960
produce some new unique turps into the

1546
01:01:05,838 --> 01:01:10,199
market which i'm definitely looking

1547
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:10,199
forward to

1548
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:18,639
hope it wasn't too choppy

1549
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:22,318
there you go good

1550
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:24,480
yes

1551
01:01:22,318 --> 01:01:26,558
the reason why um

1552
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:29,519
what i breed for it started out as just

1553
01:01:26,559 --> 01:01:30,798
you know personal satisfaction uh the

1554
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:32,960
challenge

1555
01:01:30,798 --> 01:01:35,358
of making something that was just

1556
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:36,798
amazing or not just amazing maybe maybe

1557
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:39,920
even the best

1558
01:01:36,798 --> 01:01:42,318
um being from an island we're we're very

1559
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:44,559
localized and when someone has the best

1560
01:01:42,318 --> 01:01:47,358
it spreads really quickly through the

1561
01:01:44,559 --> 01:01:49,440
whole island that they've got the best

1562
01:01:47,358 --> 01:01:50,798
so it's always been fun and a challenge

1563
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:52,720
has always been fun when people have

1564
01:01:50,798 --> 01:01:54,639
told me of anything that you can't grow

1565
01:01:52,719 --> 01:01:56,159
that that doesn't grow here

1566
01:01:54,639 --> 01:01:58,400
oh well that sounds like a challenge to

1567
01:01:56,159 --> 01:02:01,920
me sounds like i'm going to grow it and

1568
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:04,400
i grow mainly outdoor so growing outdoor

1569
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:06,960
i have to grow a huge variety the

1570
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:09,200
seasons are crazy out here on the island

1571
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:11,358
the humidity is out of control it's

1572
01:02:09,199 --> 01:02:13,118
probably one of the most inhospitable

1573
01:02:11,358 --> 01:02:14,078
growing environments in the whole

1574
01:02:13,119 --> 01:02:17,119
country

1575
01:02:14,079 --> 01:02:19,839
uh so you know i i have to have up to 18

1576
01:02:17,119 --> 01:02:21,680
plus strains outdoors all times and that

1577
01:02:19,838 --> 01:02:23,920
sometimes you'll lose

1578
01:02:21,679 --> 01:02:26,078
six strains in full so

1579
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:27,920
breeding has to do a lot with the

1580
01:02:26,079 --> 01:02:30,240
finding the strains that work finding

1581
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:32,079
the right ones and the challenge is

1582
01:02:30,239 --> 01:02:33,919
always great you know it's always fun to

1583
01:02:32,079 --> 01:02:34,960
pick something and say i'm going to make

1584
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:37,119
this

1585
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:39,199
and then go make it i don't find the

1586
01:02:37,119 --> 01:02:40,720
strands first sometimes i pick

1587
01:02:39,199 --> 01:02:43,038
what i want to make i want to make

1588
01:02:40,719 --> 01:02:45,439
something that smells like bananas

1589
01:02:43,039 --> 01:02:47,920
then i have to go find through so many

1590
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:49,920
strains to find the male and the female

1591
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:52,720
that actually smell that way to put them

1592
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:54,480
together so breeding a lot of it is is a

1593
01:02:52,719 --> 01:02:56,879
challenge it's a lot the personal

1594
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:58,400
satisfaction and it's the fun of it

1595
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:00,240
finding something new something

1596
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:03,119
spectacular when you give it to someone

1597
01:03:00,239 --> 01:03:06,239
and they go whoa it blows their mind

1598
01:03:03,119 --> 01:03:06,240
that's why we do it

1599
01:03:12,318 --> 01:03:16,798
oh well for me i it's

1600
01:03:14,798 --> 01:03:18,639
i'm not much of a breeder like everybody

1601
01:03:16,798 --> 01:03:21,679
here so it's a privilege to be even with

1602
01:03:18,639 --> 01:03:23,679
you guys um i'm more of like uh your

1603
01:03:21,679 --> 01:03:26,960
average consumer you know i have a few

1604
01:03:23,679 --> 01:03:29,519
packs from a few you guys here so

1605
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:30,798
um for me i just love the hunt

1606
01:03:29,519 --> 01:03:33,038
um

1607
01:03:30,798 --> 01:03:36,318
if i do like something that's gonna drop

1608
01:03:33,039 --> 01:03:38,000
i'm gonna get two packs of it pop it see

1609
01:03:36,318 --> 01:03:39,519
if i can find something out of two or

1610
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:42,079
three packs

1611
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:44,960
i'm just that type of consumer so

1612
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:47,280
for me i'm just having fun just looking

1613
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:49,440
for those phenos and uh that's my big

1614
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:51,440
thing just trying to have fun with it

1615
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:53,760
popping everybody's seeds whenever i get

1616
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:56,559
an opportunity to see somebody's like

1617
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:59,760
work i'll reach out to ask um

1618
01:03:56,559 --> 01:04:01,119
for me it it doesn't hurt to ask so

1619
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:02,960
the

1620
01:04:01,119 --> 01:04:04,798
whatever's out there i'm gonna ask and

1621
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:06,159
i'm gonna try and get it i've even flown

1622
01:04:04,798 --> 01:04:08,079
out to

1623
01:04:06,159 --> 01:04:09,598
california a couple of times for some

1624
01:04:08,079 --> 01:04:11,760
clone drops

1625
01:04:09,599 --> 01:04:13,119
uh for me it's just having fun man and

1626
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:15,359
trying to bring that shit over here to

1627
01:04:13,119 --> 01:04:17,599
like the the east coast side and dmv

1628
01:04:15,358 --> 01:04:20,159
area

1629
01:04:17,599 --> 01:04:22,720
and what do you personally like to smoke

1630
01:04:20,159 --> 01:04:25,118
uh right now i'm honestly stuck on a

1631
01:04:22,719 --> 01:04:26,639
banana cream cake crossfit jealousy from

1632
01:04:25,119 --> 01:04:28,559
a sea junkie

1633
01:04:26,639 --> 01:04:31,679
uh that shit is uh

1634
01:04:28,559 --> 01:04:34,000
shit's fucking crazy as flower or hash

1635
01:04:31,679 --> 01:04:36,399
it's flower yeah flowery up i went out

1636
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:37,199
there and grabbed a clone for the drop

1637
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:40,798
and

1638
01:04:37,199 --> 01:04:42,879
yeah it's probably one of the biggest uh

1639
01:04:40,798 --> 01:04:45,519
positives i've i've done since i've been

1640
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:47,358
growing you know so that was a big thing

01:04:47,358 --> 01:04:52,000
library right now so it's rotations

1643
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:55,838

1652
01:05:18,798 --> 01:05:22,559
you know um but uh lately i've been

1653
01:05:21,199 --> 01:05:26,318
really kind of getting into the skittle

1654
01:05:22,559 --> 01:05:28,240
surfs um there's a few um cookie runs um

1655
01:05:26,318 --> 01:05:30,079
crosses that we've been finding lately

1656
01:05:28,239 --> 01:05:32,239
in the in this seed hunt that have

1657
01:05:30,079 --> 01:05:34,318
really started to open my mind to those

1658
01:05:32,239 --> 01:05:36,959
candy terps once again i remember trying

1659
01:05:34,318 --> 01:05:38,558
that back in 2016 at the emerald cup

1660
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:40,240
with the turf hogs kind of threw that

1661
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:43,039
out there and that was one of those

1662
01:05:40,239 --> 01:05:45,598
terps that just always stuck with me so

1663
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:46,799
i love the candy terps i'm primarily a

1664
01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:49,599
gas head

1665
01:05:46,798 --> 01:05:51,280
i breed i breed for flavor flavor pretty

1666
01:05:49,599 --> 01:05:53,200
much um solely

1667
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:55,200
effect as well we're looking for some

1668
01:05:53,199 --> 01:05:57,199
things that can help people medicinally

1669
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:59,279
i did a couple cbd projects that really

1670
01:05:57,199 --> 01:06:01,118
helped a lot of crohn's patients and ibs

1671
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:02,960
patients so we're trying to bring some

1672
01:06:01,119 --> 01:06:05,280
of that back as well but

1673
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:07,199
primarily for terps and uh short

1674
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:10,160
flowering times and hearty hearty plants

1675
01:06:07,199 --> 01:06:10,159
for this main weather

1676
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:14,639
yeah

1677
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:15,440
i'm jason's apprentice so i'm kind of

1678
01:06:14,639 --> 01:06:17,358
like

1679
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:18,559
shadowing him through this whole process

1680
01:06:17,358 --> 01:06:20,480
which has been

1681
01:06:18,559 --> 01:06:23,440
unbelievable to watch but

1682
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:25,760
i'm a big citrus guy and we have some

1683
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:27,358
serious citrus coming down

1684
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:29,680
so i'm looking forward to that and i've

1685
01:06:27,358 --> 01:06:32,798
kind of fallen in love with

1686
01:06:29,679 --> 01:06:35,440
the kawaii candy from 808 that stuff's

1687
01:06:32,798 --> 01:06:37,119
like gas candy all day long

1688
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:39,679
so

1689
01:06:37,119 --> 01:06:41,519
anything with gas or citrus is kind of

1690
01:06:39,679 --> 01:06:45,318
my game and

1691
01:06:41,519 --> 01:06:45,318
especially on the exhale

1692
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:52,010
i had to throw on a hat everyone in the

1693
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:55,829
comments

1694
01:06:52,010 --> 01:06:55,830
[Laughter]

1695
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,960
without a hat on

1696
01:06:57,519 --> 01:07:01,519
there you go you got a beard you can

1697
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:01,519
throw on to

1698
01:07:03,679 --> 01:07:07,838
keeps the sun off of us

1699
01:07:05,358 --> 01:07:07,838
that's right

1700
01:07:08,079 --> 01:07:12,720
um well i'll answer what i'm smoking

1701
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:14,399
obviously don't breed because

1702
01:07:12,719 --> 01:07:16,159
who would have the time after everything

1703
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:19,440
else we're doing but uh

1704
01:07:16,159 --> 01:07:22,159
ice um preserving some of the hype train

1705
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:24,159
from the last colorado cup with uh

1706
01:07:22,159 --> 01:07:26,159
some boveda packs so smoking on that and

1707
01:07:24,159 --> 01:07:27,118
then jake's cousin is this awesome

1708
01:07:26,159 --> 01:07:29,679
grower

1709
01:07:27,119 --> 01:07:32,400
down in crested butte i have no idea

1710
01:07:29,679 --> 01:07:34,318
what he brought us but it's awesome i

1711
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:37,200
uh and he's unfortunately not allowed to

1712
01:07:34,318 --> 01:07:39,358
compete because we're a fair competition

1713
01:07:37,199 --> 01:07:41,598
and family or sorry family members are

1714
01:07:39,358 --> 01:07:44,480
allowed to uh join the grow off

1715
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:44,480
unfortunately

1716
01:07:46,239 --> 01:07:50,879
maybe we can just do a friends and

1717
01:07:47,519 --> 01:07:50,880
family one there you go

1718
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:57,838
so all right so any other

1719
01:07:54,639 --> 01:07:57,838
chat questions

1720
01:07:58,239 --> 01:08:03,199
someone asked about auto seeds i saw at

1721
01:08:00,719 --> 01:08:04,798
one point um and we've been asked to do

1722
01:08:03,199 --> 01:08:06,318
competitions

1723
01:08:04,798 --> 01:08:08,079
and i the

1724
01:08:06,318 --> 01:08:10,239
wrapping my brain around that you know

1725
01:08:08,079 --> 01:08:12,318
everyone gets a lottery ticket do they

1726
01:08:10,239 --> 01:08:14,879
pop do do they not like that's why we do

1727
01:08:12,318 --> 01:08:18,560
the clone thing uh but i am curious they

1728
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:18,560
all have opinions on autos

1729
01:08:19,198 --> 01:08:22,000
i have opinions

1730
01:08:22,238 --> 01:08:26,718
lots of okay fun if i need some bumper

1731
01:08:24,479 --> 01:08:29,358
crop in my veg or an early like july

1732
01:08:26,719 --> 01:08:31,520
crop maybe but dude night owl's always

1733
01:08:29,359 --> 01:08:33,520
been it's kind of some of my go-to or

1734
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:35,120
mephisto

1735
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:37,359
yeah yeah

1736
01:08:35,119 --> 01:08:37,358
guys

1737
01:08:37,679 --> 01:08:41,838
but uh daz actually just moved up here

1738
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:43,600
to maine so we've been kind of chatting

1739
01:08:41,838 --> 01:08:45,278
back and forth about a few things but i

1740
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:46,960
trust his work a lot

1741
01:08:45,279 --> 01:08:49,199
um but i feel like as far as the

1742
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:50,798
competition style it might be

1743
01:08:49,198 --> 01:08:53,599
something where you might give somebody

1744
01:08:50,798 --> 01:08:55,039
sick leads to kind of uh maybe maybe

1745
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:57,039
everybody gets to make their selection

1746
01:08:55,039 --> 01:08:59,278
out of a 16 block

1747
01:08:57,039 --> 01:09:01,359
rather having to have like one

1748
01:08:59,279 --> 01:09:03,520
plant to kind of move forward with so to

1749
01:09:01,359 --> 01:09:05,838
speak but yeah but then how do you judge

1750
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:07,520
it because like it can't be tested

1751
01:09:05,838 --> 01:09:09,600
because like one fino is going to test

1752
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:12,880
higher than another finance but he can't

1753
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:12,880
clone an autoflower

1754
01:09:13,279 --> 01:09:17,920
you damage the roots just once twice

1755
01:09:15,759 --> 01:09:19,679
like

1756
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:22,560
there's really no way to have like a

1757
01:09:19,679 --> 01:09:24,480
baseline on that

1758
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:26,480
you know autoflower and they don't they

1759
01:09:24,479 --> 01:09:28,718
just quote have the uh

1760
01:09:26,479 --> 01:09:30,479
they don't have what the regular

1761
01:09:28,719 --> 01:09:31,359
the photo

1762
01:09:30,479 --> 01:09:33,198
they don't really have those

1763
01:09:31,359 --> 01:09:34,798
capabilities so it would be tough but

1764
01:09:33,198 --> 01:09:36,639
you'd probably just have to do like the

1765
01:09:34,798 --> 01:09:38,560
best selection out of everybody's pack

1766
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:40,960
of seeds and kind of hope that you got a

1767
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:43,279
good selection but i mean as analytical

1768
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:45,039
results it would be kind of a toss up

1769
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:48,080
but

1770
01:09:45,039 --> 01:09:50,079
do you guys read much autoflower

1771
01:09:48,079 --> 01:09:52,640
i've i've done it several times and i do

1772
01:09:50,079 --> 01:09:54,479
regular autoflower i do i mean i've done

1773
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:55,920
it a lot and i have some really cool

1774
01:09:54,479 --> 01:09:58,399
autoflowers you guys want to try them

1775
01:09:55,920 --> 01:10:01,440

oh yes thank you peter uh this is we

1793
01:10:37,279 --> 01:10:42,719
just implemented

1794
01:10:39,198 --> 01:10:45,678
pathogen testing two years ago and it it

1795
01:10:42,719 --> 01:10:47,520
caused just so many additional issues on

1796
01:10:45,679 --> 01:10:49,760
top of everything else because people

1797
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:52,000
weren't talking as much about hopsleyton

1798
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:54,719
as they are now and i still don't think

1799
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:56,560
that a lot of growers know what it is

1800
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:59,520
and we are testing for it for the

1801
01:10:56,560 --> 01:11:02,880
grow-off clones uh so i'd love to hear

1802
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:05,280
everyone's thoughts on the topic

1803
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:07,359
i mean i saw a hop late in viroid like

1804
01:11:05,279 --> 01:11:08,960
years ago on some gelato cuts that kind

1805
01:11:07,359 --> 01:11:11,119
of making their way up here before

1806
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:13,039
everybody was talking about it and i was

1807
01:11:11,119 --> 01:11:15,439
kind of noticing like a dudding the

1808
01:11:13,039 --> 01:11:17,519
quote-unquote dudding disease and it was

1809
01:11:15,439 --> 01:11:19,678
very random on the plant like there

1810
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:21,920
could be one branch that was looking

1811
01:11:19,679 --> 01:11:23,600
funky but the rest of the plant was fine

1812
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:25,279
kind of started noticing it moving to

1813
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:27,199
other strains so at that point i had to

1814
01:11:25,279 --> 01:11:29,198
just kind of mix the garden and move on

1815
01:11:27,198 --> 01:11:31,119
and honestly i haven't seen it since but

1816
01:11:29,198 --> 01:11:32,559
it just seems to be

1817
01:11:31,119 --> 01:11:35,039
you know when you're when you're

1818
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:36,640
purchasing clones from trusted places

1819
01:11:35,039 --> 01:11:38,880
it's hard to know where everybody's

1820
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:40,960
getting and sourcing their things and

1821
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:43,840
you know unless there's like uh some

1822
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:45,679
sort of you know breed or pedigree you

1823
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:47,679
know documentation that comes with it

1824
01:11:45,679 --> 01:11:50,079
there's really no way to know unless you

1825
01:11:47,679 --> 01:11:52,158
test everything it's only 25 bucks per

1826
01:11:50,079 --> 01:11:54,640
plant to get it tested so it's not a

1827
01:11:52,158 --> 01:11:55,599
very expensive test but

1828
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:56,719
you know when you're taking in new

1829
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:58,400
things you just have to take every

1830
01:11:56,719 --> 01:12:00,480
precaution and hop late and viral it's

1831
01:11:58,399 --> 01:12:02,559
going to be one of those things until

1832
01:12:00,479 --> 01:12:05,279
you do some seed pops and there is some

1833
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:07,920
discussion that it can transfer to seed

1834
01:12:05,279 --> 01:12:09,519
into the progeny as well so

1835
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:11,279
you know best thing that you can do for

1836
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:13,199
yourself is to start from seed as much

1837
01:12:11,279 --> 01:12:14,960
as possible but i've heard a lot of

1838
01:12:13,198 --> 01:12:17,839
people say that they've um they can get

1839
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:20,480
rid of it through tissue culture also

1840
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:22,640
out and new cloning new tips you guys

1841
01:12:20,479 --> 01:12:22,639
have

1842
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:28,760
is

1843
01:12:37,359 --> 01:12:41,599
so i've heard there's a company

1844
01:12:39,119 --> 01:12:44,319
advertising them with clans populating

1845
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:46,320
thyroid out of uh tissue culture plants

1846
01:12:44,319 --> 01:12:48,000
it's in california actually i don't

1847
01:12:46,319 --> 01:12:51,198
remember what it was but they said you

1848
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:52,800
could send them your infected plants and

1849
01:12:51,198 --> 01:12:56,158
they will cleanse them for you and send

1850
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:56,159
you back the fun

1851
01:12:58,079 --> 01:13:01,679
you're going to keep that genetic though

1852
01:13:02,158 --> 01:13:05,799
they file those

1853
01:13:08,238 --> 01:13:11,678
in the cleansing of the genetics they

1854
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:12,880
said they can do all types of

1855
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:14,000
cleansing

1856
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:16,000
interesting

1857
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,960
it's possible for sure i mean the plant

1858
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,800
is okay

1859
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:20,640
if you get a virus you can cleanse that

1860
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:23,760
virus from your system you know if

1861
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:26,320
you're if you're a strong enough

1862
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:28,000
immune system to be able to fight off

1863
01:13:26,319 --> 01:13:29,759
then you can fight it off and then not

1864
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:31,279
necessarily transfer it into the next

1865
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:33,520
clone generation

1866
01:13:31,279 --> 01:13:35,840
um because it doesn't necessarily affect

1867
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:37,520
the whole plant at the same time you

1868
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:39,119
know like some part of the plant can be

1869
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:41,360
affected while other parts of the plant

1870
01:13:39,119 --> 01:13:42,880
are not and it doesn't necessarily mean

1871
01:13:41,359 --> 01:13:44,479
that when you transfer it forward you're

1872
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:47,440
going to be transferring it forward with

1873
01:13:44,479 --> 01:13:49,119
the virus it's a really weird deal

1874
01:13:47,439 --> 01:13:50,799
honestly and it's

1875
01:13:49,119 --> 01:13:52,559
it's really important we talk more about

1876
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:54,480
it because so few people know that it's

1877
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:57,679
even existing in their gardens they have

1878
01:13:54,479 --> 01:14:00,399
no idea why entire cloners are dying off

1879
01:13:57,679 --> 01:14:02,719
or entire trays of plants are dying off

1880
01:14:00,399 --> 01:14:04,879
all at once in the middle of flower it's

1881
01:14:02,719 --> 01:14:06,800
just the weirdest shit you know

1882
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:08,719
so i mean i i think that it's really

1883
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:10,719
important to sort of try and understand

1884
01:14:08,719 --> 01:14:13,119
this and then also not to necessarily be

1885
01:14:10,719 --> 01:14:15,279
afraid of it because we can kill it we

1886
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:16,960
can uh figure out ways to clean the

1887
01:14:15,279 --> 01:14:19,198
plants of it and it doesn't mean that

1888
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:20,719
once you get it then your your genetic

1889
01:14:19,198 --> 01:14:23,119
that you've loved for 20 years is

1890
01:14:20,719 --> 01:14:24,880
necessarily gone it's not it just means

1891
01:14:23,119 --> 01:14:26,960
that you've got some work to do

1892
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:28,560
yeah there's products like recall mess

1893
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:30,399
that you can use to clean and sterilize

1894
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:32,159
your equipment to make sure that you're

1895
01:14:30,399 --> 01:14:34,719
not passing it on to other plants and

1896
01:14:32,158 --> 01:14:36,639
making sure your sops are are good when

1897
01:14:34,719 --> 01:14:39,198
you're going from plant viewpoint based

1898
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:41,360
on using new scalpels or making sure

1899
01:14:39,198 --> 01:14:43,279
that you're cleaning your utensils as

1900
01:14:41,359 --> 01:14:44,479
you go that's a product that you can

1901
01:14:43,279 --> 01:14:46,800
kind of find

1902
01:14:44,479 --> 01:14:48,000
at most walmarts it's in the pet section

1903
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:50,719
it's a

1904
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:52,158
yellow tub but it is a buyer side that

1905
01:14:50,719 --> 01:14:55,719
works pretty well for cleaning and

1906
01:14:52,158 --> 01:14:55,719
sterilizing equipment

1907
01:14:56,800 --> 01:15:00,400
well another thing i think is

1908
01:14:58,158 --> 01:15:03,839
interesting about population is that you

1909
01:15:00,399 --> 01:15:06,719
tend to see it in environments where the

1910
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:09,760
plants aren't necessarily as strong

1911
01:15:06,719 --> 01:15:11,198
so um and real

1912
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:12,480
and i'm not saying that this is is a

1913
01:15:11,198 --> 01:15:14,319
hundred percent of the case but the

1914
01:15:12,479 --> 01:15:17,198
place where i see hoplite virus the

1915
01:15:14,319 --> 01:15:19,359
worst is in complicated hydrogen systems

1916
01:15:17,198 --> 01:15:21,919
so if you have like a super complicated

1917
01:15:19,359 --> 01:15:24,399
drip system or an aeroponic system or

1918
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:26,800
something like that and hopladen virus

1919
01:15:24,399 --> 01:15:28,399
has a real chance of taking over your

1920
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:30,239
plants in a way that it doesn't

1921
01:15:28,399 --> 01:15:32,158
necessarily if you run

1922
01:15:30,238 --> 01:15:34,959
you know maybe a more organic based

1923
01:15:32,158 --> 01:15:37,839
system where the the plants uh

1924
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:40,960
have a stronger uh

1925
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:43,279
system or if you run you know a

1926
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:44,880
a system that is is is just where the

1927
01:15:43,279 --> 01:15:46,639
plants have a stronger immune system

1928
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:49,199
even in hydro you don't see it as much

1929
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:50,719
it's really where you're having problems

1930
01:15:49,198 --> 01:15:52,879
in the first place is where you tend to

1931
01:15:50,719 --> 01:15:55,439
see a lot more oscillating virus

1932
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:57,039
anything anything that's susceptible to

1933
01:15:55,439 --> 01:15:59,599
disease

1934
01:15:57,039 --> 01:16:01,439
is gonna get it first no matter what

1935
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:03,360
especially with older plants like

1936
01:16:01,439 --> 01:16:05,439
specifically with like plant count laws

1937
01:16:03,359 --> 01:16:07,920
like some people are growing six plants

1938
01:16:05,439 --> 01:16:10,960
under six lights so you've got like a 10

1939
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:12,560
or 12 week veg on a plant whereas in our

1940
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:14,560
situation we're running three gallon

1941
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:15,920
pots that turn over every three weeks so

1942
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:17,840
it doesn't have a chance to express

1943
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:19,279
itself as long as it's in like perfect

1944
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:21,199
plant health

1945
01:16:19,279 --> 01:16:23,599
obviously we don't have those issues

1946
01:16:21,198 --> 01:16:25,519
here at the moment but um so you know

1947
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:27,840
plant health above all and if these if

1948
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:29,199
you keep them healthier and you have

1949
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:31,520
plants that haven't been you know

1950
01:16:29,198 --> 01:16:34,639
mothered out so much and or growing in a

1951
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:36,480
small pot for so long

1952
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:38,400
replacing your mother plants really

1953
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:40,079
often is is key

1954
01:16:38,399 --> 01:16:42,879
you know i i replace them every three

1955
01:16:40,079 --> 01:16:46,238
weeks you know i gotta bug out guys

1956
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:47,440
that's the how long they'll last

1957
01:16:46,238 --> 01:16:49,599
yeah

1958
01:16:47,439 --> 01:16:50,399
thanks john um that's it see you guys

1959
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:52,800
later

1960
01:16:50,399 --> 01:16:54,479
got to replace them and then

1961
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:56,880
go again keep them healthy keep them

1962
01:16:54,479 --> 01:16:58,959
growing healthy you know uh when you're

1963
01:16:56,880 --> 01:17:00,960
when you're going on a small scale

1964
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:03,600
indoors i don't do much indoor growing

1965
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:06,158
but what i've found is that it once the

1966
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:08,239
roots fill the pot size you're a hundred

1967
01:17:06,158 --> 01:17:09,599
percent relying on your fertilizer

1968
01:17:08,238 --> 01:17:12,158
regiment

1969
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:14,880
but if you give that pot some space give

1970
01:17:12,158 --> 01:17:17,279
those roots a lot of space to grow

1971
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:19,440
that way especially through flour i when

1972
01:17:17,279 --> 01:17:21,759
i grow indoor i have run into that

1973
01:17:19,439 --> 01:17:24,639
problem all the time vegging too long so

1974
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:27,199
i only veg for 14 to 20 days

1975
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:29,600
that's it hit them in 14 days veg bam

1976
01:17:27,198 --> 01:17:31,839
flower so that the roots never actually

1977
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:34,400
fill the pot and they're healthy the

1978
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:37,199
whole flower cycle if you can get to the

1979
01:17:34,399 --> 01:17:38,799
end of the flower with healthy roots the

1980
01:17:37,198 --> 01:17:41,439
healthier the plant the healthier and

1981
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:41,440
better the bud

1982
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:45,600
which in like um

1983
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:47,679
you know larger rooms with larger plant

1984
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:50,079
counts and smaller pots you can achieve

1985
01:17:47,679 --> 01:17:52,000
with more watering intervals and

1986
01:17:50,079 --> 01:17:54,000
watching your dry backs a lot and that's

1987
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:56,719
where you know the technical aspect of

1988
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:58,238
growing really starts taking hold

1989
01:17:56,719 --> 01:18:00,640
yeah you can't just plug it into a

1990
01:17:58,238 --> 01:18:03,678
computer like most grow houses who run

1991
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:05,920
like a 70-day program for every single

1992
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:07,840
strain and they wonder why half of them

1993
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:09,600
are you know two three weeks too long

1994
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:11,119
have somewhere too early it's because

1995
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:13,679
you're just running by the computer

1996
01:18:11,119 --> 01:18:16,158
program you're just doing the 70-day

1997
01:18:13,679 --> 01:18:17,920
boom done and on the fertilizer program

1998
01:18:16,158 --> 01:18:20,079
the water and you're not you're not

1999
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:22,719
catering it to the plant you're just

2000
01:18:20,079 --> 01:18:24,880
catering the grow to the system and it

2001
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:27,039
does not work

2002
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:29,600
yeah i always say that uh success will

2003
01:18:27,039 --> 01:18:31,920
grow as a culmination of the sacrifices

2004
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:33,840
you made for that fire you know you

2005
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:35,279
started a hundred it's up to you to keep

2006
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:39,560
it like my old

2007
01:18:35,279 --> 01:18:39,559
history teacher used to say

2008
01:18:41,439 --> 01:18:44,719
but

2009
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:46,400
i also need the cruise but it's been a

2010
01:18:44,719 --> 01:18:49,439
pleasure talking with everybody i love

2011
01:18:46,399 --> 01:18:52,399
meeting all you guys well should we uh

2012
01:18:49,439 --> 01:18:54,319
should we wrap it on that

2013
01:18:52,399 --> 01:18:57,119
it seems like we're dwindling down past

2014
01:18:54,319 --> 01:18:57,119
the brady bunch

2015
01:18:57,600 --> 01:19:01,760
we went from brady bunch formation to

2016
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:03,520
the

2017
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:04,480
yeah

2018
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:07,480
punch

2019
01:19:04,479 --> 01:19:07,479
yeah

2020
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:27,199
we can save for the next conversation

2021
01:19:25,359 --> 01:19:29,119
all right i love it yeah we're trying to

2022
01:19:27,198 --> 01:19:31,439
prepare for big pharma entering this

2023
01:19:29,119 --> 01:19:31,439
space

2024
01:19:33,279 --> 01:19:38,000
i will say like our focus is on finding

2025
01:19:36,319 --> 01:19:39,679
like breeders doing interesting things

2026
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:41,119
we touched on this earlier people that

2027
01:19:39,679 --> 01:19:43,279
are using stuff that's not widely

2028
01:19:41,119 --> 01:19:45,119
available so i appreciate all of you for

2029
01:19:43,279 --> 01:19:47,519

2032
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:52,320
you've been asked to do is like create

2033
01:19:50,319 --> 01:19:55,439
100 clones that look identical and make

2034
