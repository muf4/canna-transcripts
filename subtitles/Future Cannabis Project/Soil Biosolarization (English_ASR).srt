1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,940
so just quickly Lydia do you have time

2
00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:11,330
to give a quick intro to solar bio

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:15,230
solarization yeah I do I have a okay so

4
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:18,868
wait before you go before you start it

5
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:20,368
let me cut the one graphic I could pull

6
00:00:18,868 --> 00:00:23,009
up so people know what we're talking

7
00:00:20,368 --> 00:00:25,640
about is that is that a reasonable

8
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:29,039
graphic for what we're talking about

9
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:34,320
look at those fun where it's digest

10
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:36,510
States and mesocosms yes this is okay so

11
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,609
this is bad this last image is real

12
00:00:36,509 --> 00:00:40,289
helpful so basically the the general

13
00:00:38,609 --> 00:00:44,670
process and thought that we're talking

14
00:00:40,289 --> 00:00:50,340
about here is the the use of different

15
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:51,960
types of plastics to cover up to cover

16
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:54,329
soil and heat it up to a certain

17
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:57,230
temperature for a certain number of days

18
00:00:54,329 --> 00:01:01,558
that basically thermally and activates

19
00:00:57,229 --> 00:01:04,170
weed seeds and pests and disease within

20
00:01:01,558 --> 00:01:06,959
a certain you know depth of the soil

21
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:09,390
surface and so we were chatting about

22
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:12,239
this privately

23
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:15,299
one of our other IPM France and the

24
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:18,658
cannabis space had shared a slide from

25
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:22,080
Jim Stapleton's work over at UC Kearney

26
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:25,859
AG research and so basically you know

27
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:27,688
this is a practice that you see

28
00:01:25,859 --> 00:01:29,179
implemented in like strawberry field so

29
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:31,379
when you drive past a field and and

30
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:34,350
there are furrows and then in between

31
00:01:31,379 --> 00:01:36,509
the furrows there are these sheets of

32
00:01:34,349 --> 00:01:39,859
plastic that are just covering like long

33
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:42,359
long rows and these big fields

34
00:01:39,859 --> 00:01:45,569
essentially the purpose and the point is

35
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:48,899
to like I said like knocked on anything

36
00:01:45,569 --> 00:01:50,489
that would be causing a difficulty in

37
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:52,618
measuring professor disease once the

38
00:01:50,489 --> 00:01:54,539
actual crop comes up they they utilize

39
00:01:52,618 --> 00:01:58,680
this type of thing when it comes to

40
00:01:54,540 --> 00:02:00,210
managing spring mix you know like the

41
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,460
greens you know there's a zero tolerance

42
00:02:00,209 --> 00:02:04,649
policy for having weeds in your spring

43
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:08,038
mix crops right but you can't go through

44
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:10,649
and hand weed you know acres and acres

45
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:13,019
that's exactly right right there that

46
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:16,650
you just put up you can't go Henry

47
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:17,909
acres of spring mix it's just something

48
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:19,409
that's you know it's a limiting factor

49
00:02:17,909 --> 00:02:21,090
the number of people that you're gonna

50
00:02:19,409 --> 00:02:22,349
have to do that you know they could

51
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:24,590
their capacity to get it right every

52
00:02:22,349 --> 00:02:28,289
time like it's pretty intense and so

53
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:31,319
what's been going on with the bio

54
00:02:28,289 --> 00:02:34,409
solarization is essentially taking the

55
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:36,629
soil solarization topic you know the

56
00:02:34,409 --> 00:02:39,509
whole background of heating up the soil

57
00:02:36,629 --> 00:02:41,609
to inactivate these these things that

58
00:02:39,509 --> 00:02:45,149
you're not wanting in your your system

59
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:48,030
and then the bio part is adding organic

60
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:50,879
material into that heating process and

61
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:53,640
as the organic material decomposes it

62
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:57,180
there are toxic breakdown products that

63
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:58,379
eliminate soil pest organisms you know

64
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:00,629
we're talking about something that's as

65
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:03,389
little as an addition of five percent of

66
00:03:00,629 --> 00:03:05,759
something like they tested tomato pumice

67
00:03:03,389 --> 00:03:08,250
white wine grape pumice and red wine

68
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:11,459
grape pumice saying that the tomato

69
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:14,580
byproducts from the traditional you know

70
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:17,010
food AG was really helpful in

71
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:18,660
eliminating some of these plant

72
00:03:17,009 --> 00:03:21,149
pathogens that they were concerned about

73
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:23,090
but you know as with everything it does

74
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:26,039
have limitations on its effectiveness

75
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:28,409
you know you wouldn't want to complete

76
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:31,079
the this type of solarization and then

77
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:33,539
move all of all of your soil or till it

78
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:35,640
or you know give it all mixed up because

79
00:03:33,539 --> 00:03:38,400
you're only inoculator you're only

80
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:42,869
really in activating those first top

81
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:45,390
inches you know six inches ish of of

82
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:49,230
topsoil up top and then the kind of the

83
00:03:45,389 --> 00:03:51,719
thought process is that the beneficial

84
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:54,299
organisms you know earthworms and other

85
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:58,169
you know fungi bacteria that you know

86
00:03:54,300 --> 00:04:00,390
they're used to a larger range and

87
00:03:58,169 --> 00:04:02,489
change in their environment they're

88
00:04:00,389 --> 00:04:04,829
they're much more like plastic and

89
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:07,140
capable of of managing environmental

90
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:10,320
stress and change differently than

91
00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:14,458
perhaps disease and pest organisms that

92
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:16,798
are going to more similarly need an

93
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:21,540
environment that matches their host

94
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:24,149
plant so you know there's there's

95
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:26,569
there's lots of information that UC

96
00:04:24,149 --> 00:04:29,929
Davis UC Kearney has put up

97
00:04:26,569 --> 00:04:32,750
there's other scholarly papers that had

98
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:35,540
put out and put out about this you know

99
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:38,600
when I worked for BASF we would put all

100
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:41,390
of our all of our media into this like

101
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:43,820
deep deep freezer and freeze everything

102
00:04:41,389 --> 00:04:46,550
for a period of time and they'd have to

103
00:04:43,819 --> 00:04:48,920
take of the big bales of material and

104
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:50,120
let them thaw before we use them in the

105
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:52,759
greenhouse

106
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:54,439
for pesticide research and so it kind of

107
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:55,930
works on the polar opposite in is that

108
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:58,610
if you create this like massive

109
00:04:55,930 --> 00:05:02,120
environmental change or in temperature

110
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:04,449
shock that you can reduce no pathogens

111
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:07,220
and pests and disease and I bet that

112
00:05:04,449 --> 00:05:09,379
that Scott and Eric and Kevin and Sarah

113
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:11,960
have all seen this employed especially

114
00:05:09,379 --> 00:05:13,759
down in Salinas Valley and other places

115
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:17,989
where there's a lot of a lot of crops

116
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:20,420
and a lot of dirt instead of soil for

117
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:22,550
sure there's a cannabis company that

118
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:26,090
does like a whole steaming thing

119
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:27,650
actually and I don't know what they

120
00:05:26,089 --> 00:05:30,769
bring in to do it but they tarp

121
00:05:27,649 --> 00:05:35,569
everything over actually inject steam in

122
00:05:30,769 --> 00:05:37,639
there wow this is where I really started

123
00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:39,829
to defer to what I learned from dr. Lane

124
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:41,959
in that like all the problems live and

125
00:05:39,829 --> 00:05:45,529
decreased oxygen conditions and all the

126
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:46,969
good things live in the increased oxygen

127
00:05:45,529 --> 00:05:50,419
conditions and there's like a gray area

128
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:52,160
in the center and you know I think

129
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:54,770
what's been missing on the growing

130
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:57,170
community at wide whether it's big AG or

131
00:05:54,769 --> 00:05:58,939
the small cannabis farmers that you know

132
00:05:57,170 --> 00:06:01,250
there's aerobic strategies for dealing

133
00:05:58,939 --> 00:06:03,620
with problems and I think that's

134
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:05,139
something that dr. Lane has discovered

135
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:10,970
and communicated that hasn't really

136
00:06:05,139 --> 00:06:17,329
settled in with the market too much you

137
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:18,980
know but it still wouldn't this this

138
00:06:17,329 --> 00:06:21,469
sounds like you're also dealing with

139
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:24,860
weed seeds which is a pretty good

140
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:26,900
strategy for dealing with that are there

141
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:31,100
doing this in preparation then on these

142
00:06:26,899 --> 00:06:33,379
rows for four do years yeah okay yeah

143
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:35,390
and the thought process is that plants

144
00:06:33,379 --> 00:06:36,949
will or the soil solarization can take

145
00:06:35,389 --> 00:06:38,629
four to six weeks you know at a certain

146
00:06:36,949 --> 00:06:39,719
temperature during the hottest part of

147
00:06:38,629 --> 00:06:42,300
the year you have to

148
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:44,400
you know brights on really high

149
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:45,810
temperatures for it to be effective and

150
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:48,629
what they're implementing the bio

151
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:50,839
solarization is they're trying to reduce

152
00:06:48,629 --> 00:06:54,420
that time and then also reduce the

153
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:56,039
temperature window requirement and so

154
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:59,460
they're changing something that's like 4

155
00:06:56,040 --> 00:07:02,010
to 6 weeks's of your field being down

156
00:06:59,459 --> 00:07:04,199
you know not not cultivating anything to

157
00:07:02,009 --> 00:07:07,170
making it you know seven to ten days and

158
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:08,909
achieving a similar effect without going

159
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:10,439
anaerobic like Scott mentioned right you

160
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:12,060
don't wanna like drench your soil and

161
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:16,829
then put a bunch of plastic tarping on

162
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:18,839
it just hope that's not was just

163
00:07:16,829 --> 00:07:21,149
interesting Peter brought it up it

164
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:23,669
sounds like it sounds like what they're

165
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:25,949
saying is by adding plant material they

166
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:28,470
shorten the duration of what's needed to

167
00:07:25,949 --> 00:07:30,839
be effective because they're composting

168
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:33,620
in place essentially so by adding the

169
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:36,810
grapes or the you know any of the

170
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:39,149
agricultural crop residues you're adding

171
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:42,120
an organic matter that probably probably

172
00:07:39,149 --> 00:07:44,399
gets hot or quicker or something because

173
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:46,470
it's composting I don't know yeah I'm a

174
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:55,739
little unclear while that process is

175
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:58,020
totally you know layer yeah you must

176
00:07:55,740 --> 00:08:00,780
have to do it in a crop rotational form

177
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:02,099
where you're doing grid a and then grid

178
00:08:00,779 --> 00:08:04,799
B is the one where you'll do

179
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:07,830
solarization and then application of

180
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:10,439
material to develop better tilts and

181
00:08:07,829 --> 00:08:13,139
then you know you'll into into mixing

182
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:14,728
that next year you would reverse it so

183
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:16,259
you're you're taking like you know a

184
00:08:14,728 --> 00:08:19,709
hundred thousand square foot you're only

185
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:21,899
growing on fifty thousand and so you do

186
00:08:19,709 --> 00:08:23,459
fifty thousand this year for 2000xt here

187
00:08:21,899 --> 00:08:24,899
but this way that solarization would

188
00:08:23,459 --> 00:08:27,810
work in the hot part of the summer

189
00:08:24,899 --> 00:08:34,019
because how can you cut a chunk of the

190
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:36,658
growing season out and get paid yeah you

191
00:08:34,019 --> 00:08:39,509
know exactly that's the hard part is

192
00:08:36,658 --> 00:08:41,399
that some of this stuff is just tough

193
00:08:39,509 --> 00:08:43,139
for us with because the benefit outdoor

194
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:46,588
is doing it outdoor and catching the

195
00:08:43,139 --> 00:08:50,669
season you don't have anything but that

196
00:08:46,589 --> 00:08:52,380
window maybe maybe this sorry I was

197
00:08:50,669 --> 00:08:53,490
gonna say maybe that's a strategy for

198
00:08:52,379 --> 00:08:55,080
like you're seeing a lot

199
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:58,019
Hemme people move into old agricultural

200
00:08:55,080 --> 00:09:01,139
grounds so maybe this is like before we

201
00:08:58,019 --> 00:09:04,019
start strategy or something like a three

202
00:09:01,139 --> 00:09:08,338
year fallow pride organic yeah you ran

203
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:10,829
which is exactly any like disease as

204
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:12,600
long as it's you know the goal and the

205
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:13,950
actual effect of it is to bring it down

206
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:16,080
to something like neutral and they're

207
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:17,459
not actually causing disease I don't see

208
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,278
a problem with it it seems like it could

209
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:21,809
fit somewhere you know as long as I'm

210
00:09:20,278 --> 00:09:24,689
always mindful that whatever we do

211
00:09:21,809 --> 00:09:27,149
produce as a solution has a it doesn't

212
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:28,770
linger around for eons of generations

213
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:30,419
and plastics and things like that as we

214
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:32,669
go forward if we can come up with

215
00:09:30,419 --> 00:09:34,409
solutions that don't that biodegrade or

216
00:09:32,669 --> 00:09:36,958
whatever as they come into the

217
00:09:34,409 --> 00:09:38,669
environment but but it sounds like to me

218
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:40,349
that if you did bring it down to neutral

219
00:09:38,669 --> 00:09:42,870
and a strategy like this you could

220
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:48,000
easily then revive it with a good

221
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:49,350
inoculum and this is where like you know

222
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,139
we spoke about some of the obstacles

223
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:54,810
that you know maybe a lane dr. Lane has

224
00:09:52,139 --> 00:09:58,230
but like this is where I put her as the

225
00:09:54,809 --> 00:10:01,049
undisputed world champion like we have

226
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:02,909
yet to run into a facility that had a

227
00:10:01,049 --> 00:10:04,379
soil pathogen problem that we couldn't

228
00:10:02,909 --> 00:10:07,289
get under control in a reasonable amount

229
00:10:04,379 --> 00:10:09,750
of time with the same strategies that we

230
00:10:07,289 --> 00:10:13,349
use to increase yield and that that's

231
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:16,589
where what dr. Lane has not missed once

232
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:19,259
you know you know despite her views on

233
00:10:16,589 --> 00:10:22,260
mineral balancing or what she thinks is

234
00:10:19,259 --> 00:10:24,299
the correct goal you know when we take

235
00:10:22,259 --> 00:10:27,419
strategies and cultivation that lead to

236
00:10:24,299 --> 00:10:30,149
an arabic root zone we don't have those

237
00:10:27,419 --> 00:10:31,860
problems at all yeah i mean i could see

238
00:10:30,149 --> 00:10:35,309
it being utilized as a first time

239
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:37,669
strategy to implement in a field and

240
00:10:35,309 --> 00:10:41,578
then as you go forward so the way that

241
00:10:37,669 --> 00:10:44,039
in soil ecology as we deal with weeds as

242
00:10:41,578 --> 00:10:46,109
we move along the ecological succession

243
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:48,360
underground in the microbes and so

244
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:50,370
that's how we start just selecting for

245
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:52,230
which plants then thrive in the system

246
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:53,909
but that's a much longer term strategy

247
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:56,310
depending on you know what your base

248
00:10:53,909 --> 00:10:58,319
soil is starting out with so i could see

249
00:10:56,309 --> 00:11:01,469
this being something definitely utilized

250
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:03,300
as a start of a system if your system is

251
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:04,980
a young system so let's say you're doing

252
00:11:03,299 --> 00:11:07,079
greens all the time and it doesn't take

253
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:09,450
much to inoculate it every time and

254
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:12,170
could do this every time because you're

255
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:16,740
not growing trees that need a very long

256
00:11:12,169 --> 00:11:18,929
you know growth ecological ecological

257
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:20,940
growth time to get that fungal component

258
00:11:18,929 --> 00:11:25,349
up that's a they have a much lower

259
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:27,270
threshold of biological numbers that

260
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:29,100
they need so for for something like

261
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:32,429
greens I could see that being a good

262
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:36,889
strategy yeah introducing this is an

263
00:11:32,429 --> 00:11:36,889
alternative to conventional fumigation

264
00:11:45,559 --> 00:11:49,829
that's how they do organic walnuts

265
00:11:48,179 --> 00:11:52,169
because it takes four years before

266
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:55,139
there's nuts so they dig out the old

267
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:55,709
tree methylbromide the whole plant a new

268
00:11:55,139 --> 00:11:58,439
one

269
00:11:55,710 --> 00:12:08,070
and in four years when it produces it

270
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:10,020
can be deemed organic yeah what one of

271
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:13,020
the most profound moments in my entire

272
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:17,159
you know growing career was I was at a

273
00:12:13,019 --> 00:12:19,079
greenhouse in Salinas and you know the

274
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:20,639
owner of the property also is growing

275
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:23,550
strawberries and they brought in like a

276
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:26,129
flat of clam shells of strawberries and

277
00:12:23,549 --> 00:12:28,559
all the weed all the white weed people

278
00:12:26,129 --> 00:12:30,330
were just devouring down but like not

279
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:32,519
one of the non-english speaking

280
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:34,560
agricultural workers would go anywhere

281
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:36,000
near those strawberries and I even kind

282
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:38,609
of was like you want some and their face

283
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,350
was like oh really that was a really

284
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:43,259
profound moment like they've been in the

285
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:45,060
trenches they know what goes down and

286
00:12:43,259 --> 00:12:47,250
which I think is the beauty of regulated

287
00:12:45,059 --> 00:12:52,289
cannabis right now like we're getting a

288
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:54,840
real strong snapshot with major

289
00:12:52,289 --> 00:12:58,169
financial losses tied to the things that

290
00:12:54,840 --> 00:13:00,149
we regularly do in agriculture yeah that

291
00:12:58,169 --> 00:13:02,870
effect cat 3 testing which i think is

292
00:13:00,149 --> 00:13:05,730
really the kind of poetic aspect of

293
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:07,560
cannabis is so good at bio remediating

294
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:09,330
that it's like cleaning up agriculture

295
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:11,279
that's next door because of the

296
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:13,590
contamination that's leading to a cat 3

297
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:16,259
failure and a loss of investment so now

298
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:18,330
there's a motivation to look at how

299
00:13:16,259 --> 00:13:19,960
toxic our farming is and how far that

300
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:23,230
spreads away from the actual

301
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:25,050
cultural field is remediating the

302
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:31,259
cultivators do

303
00:13:25,049 --> 00:13:31,259
[Laughter]
