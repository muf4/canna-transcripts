1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,600
thanks for joining us today for our

2
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:05,120
presentation on phenotypic expression

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,720
and why it matters

4
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,879
and it's easy to lose track of the

5
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:11,120
fundamentals amongst emerging data and

6
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,559
crop steering theories we want to make

7
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:14,399
sure that we're thinking about the end

8
00:00:12,558 --> 00:00:16,640
product when it comes to all aspects of

9
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,320
facility design and to start i want to

10
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,719
give a quick introduction to my friend

11
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,719
and co-presenter anders peterson who's a

12
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:24,799
molecular biologist with hands in the

13
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:27,278
dirt cultivation experience

14
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,039
owned an extract company dispensary and

15
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:31,118
has been a valued partner to numerous

16
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,960
large-scale cannabis businesses

17
00:00:31,118 --> 00:00:34,799
and i've been in the cannabis business

18
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,320
business since graduating berkeley like

19
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:38,078
15 years ago

20
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,480
i've owned cannabis businesses run

21
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,840
cultivation facilities and use that

22
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:43,919
knowledge and experience to help

23
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,079
facilities produce the best product as

24
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,480
efficiently as possible

25
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:51,359
together we analyze peer-reviewed papers

26
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:53,839
real-world metrics and data and turn

27
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:56,479
cannabis science into business solutions

28
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:59,120
by focusing on the kpis that influence

29
00:00:56,479 --> 00:01:01,279
every aspect of cannabis production

30
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:03,839
and that's the reason we get so drawn to

31
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,599
discussions on phenotype

32
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,000
in this webinar we'd like to focus on

33
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:10,079
the meaning of a phenotype and why it is

34
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,560
the foundation to success of indoor

35
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:14,319
cultivation businesses with that i'd

36
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,920
like to turn it over to anders and let

37
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:17,359
us get started

38
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,359
thanks jesse

39
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:21,118
well i'm excited to be here today to

40
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:23,200
talk about a subject that is near and

41
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:25,438
dear to my heart phenotypes and

42
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,439
phenotypic expression

43
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:29,438
and really what we are talking about is

44
00:01:27,438 --> 00:01:31,599
the uniqueness of cannabis

45
00:01:29,438 --> 00:01:34,158
varieties and how we can maximize the

46
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:36,478
expression of each cultivar

47
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:38,880
there are more desirable phenotypes and

48
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:40,719
there are less desirable phenotypes

49
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:43,118
then there are certain varieties stacked

50
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:44,798
with so many desirable traits

51
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:47,118
that it's like you just stumbled upon a

52
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,799
unicorn it's a keeper

53
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:51,359
hunting through all this variety in

54
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:53,680
cannabis to find something truly special

55
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:56,399
is a huge reason why people devote their

56
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,719
life to this plant including myself

57
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:02,000
the variety keeps it fun and interesting

58
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:03,118
the smells colors effects or how it

59
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,840
grows

60
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:09,439
you might have heard of skunk one chem

61
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:11,120
91 northern lights 5 all the og cush and

62
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:13,039
girl scout varieties

63
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,759
these names and numbers represent a

64
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:17,199
unique expression of the cannabis genome

65
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:18,079
and we're going to explain how that

66
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:19,598
works

67
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,840
and why the environment in which they

68
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:24,000
are grown is so

69
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:26,400
crucial legends brands and fortunes are

70
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,598
built on good genetic potential with

71
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,760
maximum phenotypic expression

72
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:33,280
let's begin with the definition

73
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:36,159
phenotype

74
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:38,479
the set of observable characteristics of

75
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:41,359
an individual resulting from the

76
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:42,719
interaction of its genotype with the

77
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,640
environment

78
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:47,359
and in regards to cannabis

79
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:48,958
phenotype describes the plant's physical

80
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,040
appearance or form

81
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:54,080
its developmental growth its

82
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:56,318
biochemistry and its behavior

83
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:59,120
the key words to focus on here

84
00:02:56,318 --> 00:03:00,878
are interaction of genotype with the

85
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,360
environment

86
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:05,039
in fact this definition is often

87
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,319
simplified and represented as an

88
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:09,039
equation

89
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:10,479
genotype plus environment equals

90
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:12,799
phenotype

91
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:14,719
so really there are two factors that

92
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,760
generally influence the way a plant

93
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:18,318
grows

94
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:20,959
the genetics and the environment the

95
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:22,878
environment is 50 of the equation

96
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,719
and that is why having precision

97
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:26,639
environmental control in your facility

98
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:28,959
is so important

99
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:30,719
the term phenotype can be used in two

100
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,039
different ways it can get kind of a

101
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:35,680
little bit convoluted

102
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:38,000
phenotype can refer to a singular trait

103
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,879
that the plant displays for example

104
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,959
color

105
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:43,439
this plant displays a purple flower

106
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:45,439
phenotype and this other plant displays

107
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:47,840
a green flower phenotype

108
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:50,400
or it can refer to all of the observable

109
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,519
characteristics displayed by a certain

110
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,438
plant

111
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,438
the phenotype of this plant is more

112
00:03:53,438 --> 00:03:57,280
desirable than the phenotype displayed

113
00:03:55,438 --> 00:03:58,959
by this other plant

114
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,039
scientists tried to clear this dual

115
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:04,000
meaning up by introducing the term

116
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:05,919
phenome similar to genome

117
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,360
to describe the collection of traits a

118
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:09,280
plant exhibits

119
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,480
but this was never really universally

120
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,560
adopted

121
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:15,438
so we use phenotype to describe a

122
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,600
singular trait or an accumulation of all

123
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:20,879
the traits expressed by a plant under

124
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:23,199
certain environmental conditions

125
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:24,399
another nuance to this definition of

126
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,720
phenotype

127
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:28,478
is the word observable

128
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,919
but that doesn't mean just with the

129
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:32,879
naked eye

130
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:36,000
it can also mean traits that can be made

131
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:37,918
visible by some technical procedure like

132
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,918
in a laboratory

133
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:41,918
an example of this in humans would be

134
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:43,839
blood typing you can't see it with the

135
00:04:41,918 --> 00:04:45,279
naked eye but it is a phenotype of

136
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:47,439
yourself

137
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:49,359
and in cannabis the cannabinoid and

138
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:50,800
terpene profiles that you see on lab

139
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,120
reports

140
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,840
to describe the unique chemical

141
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:59,199
expression of the plant we use the term

142
00:04:55,839 --> 00:05:01,839
chemotype or sometimes chemovar

143
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,759
which is the chemical phenotype

144
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:06,638
this is the cannabinoid and terpene

145
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:09,199
quantities and ratios that a specific

146
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,280
cannabis phenotype produces

147
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,680
currently there are about five broad

148
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:15,918
classes of cannabis chemotypes

149
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,478
based on the dominant cannabinoid that

150
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:18,478
is produced

151
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:23,360
now that we have a base understanding of

152
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,680
what a phenotype is

153
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,600
let's dive into what a genotype is a

154
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,079
quick refresher on how genes are

155
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,919
expressed and some examples of how the

156
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:35,359
environment can affect the expression of

157
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:35,359
these genes in cannabis

158
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:40,319
what is a genotype

159
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:42,000
a genotype is an organism's complete set

160
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:44,560
of genetic material

161
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,160
although it is often used to refer to a

162
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,360
specific gene

163
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:51,840
or a set of genes in a genome

164
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,960
think of it as like the basic genetic

165
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:58,000
boundaries which define a range of

166
00:05:54,959 --> 00:06:01,279
phenotypic possibilities

167
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,439
just like humans cannabis is diploid

168
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:04,719
and has two homologous copies of each

169
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:07,439
chromosome

170
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:10,000
one copy from the male parent plant and

171
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:12,800
one from the female parent plant

172
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,399
each chromosome in the pair contains the

173
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:19,680
same genes in the same order and place

174
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:22,560
along the length of the chromosome

175
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:25,199
these genes then get expressed into the

176
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:28,160
phenotypic traits that we observe

177
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:30,000
a segment of the double-stranded dna

178
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,000
undergoes transcription

179
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,639
which forms a single-stranded rna

180
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,639
transcript which is then translated into

181
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,478
a functional protein

182
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,240
and in this kind of oversimplified

183
00:06:38,478 --> 00:06:42,399
example to the right

184
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,439
this protein might help produce a purple

185
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:45,439
pigment

186
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:49,598
and then the end result of this gene

187
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:52,000
expression is a purple flower

188
00:06:49,598 --> 00:06:54,079
punnett squares are used by biologists

189
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,918
to determine the probability of an

190
00:06:54,079 --> 00:07:00,399
offspring having a particular genotype

191
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:04,478
it shows all the possible combinations

192
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:04,478
of paternal and maternal alleles

193
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:10,478
we have the parental genotypes with each

194
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:12,079
of their dominant or recessive alleles

195
00:07:10,478 --> 00:07:13,758
one allele from each of their

196
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:15,839
chromosomes

197
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:18,800
then we have the offspring's predicted

198
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:21,038
genotypes and phenotypes

199
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:24,560
in this example the allele for tall

200
00:07:21,038 --> 00:07:26,240
plant is dominant so ever we see a big t

201
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,560
the plant will be tall

202
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,800
if the offspring inherited two recessive

203
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,439
alleles little t

204
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,918
then we see a short plant phenotype like

205
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:38,079
the square in the bottom right

206
00:07:35,918 --> 00:07:40,959
punnett squares can be used to predict

207
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:42,719
phenotypes but without a real high

208
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:44,638
degree of accuracy

209
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,479
and why is this

210
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:49,439
well because there are a lot of other

211
00:07:46,478 --> 00:07:51,918
factors at play that influence how these

212
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:54,000
genotypes are expressed

213
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:57,560
and one of the most important

214
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,560
being the environment

215
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:04,000
now some traits are largely determined

216
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:06,479
by the genotype alone

217
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,839
while other phenotypic traits are highly

218
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:09,839
influenced by the environment

219
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,918
this can be described as phenotypic

220
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,400
plasticity

221
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:19,038
the ability to vary phenotypic

222
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:20,560
expression in response to environmental

223
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:23,439
conditions

224
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:25,598
this is why you can get two clones with

225
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:27,598
identical genotypes

226
00:08:25,598 --> 00:08:29,279
to two different growers

227
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:31,439
now and the end product could look

228
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:33,679
completely different from each other due

229
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:36,799
to the way the environment steers and

230
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:38,478
influences the plants growth

231
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:40,718
plant growth rates

232
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:43,599
morphology and timing of plant

233
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:46,000
development are examples of some traits

234
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:48,879
that are generally plastic

235
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,480
anecdotally all cannabis cultiva

236
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:52,159
cultivators know

237
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,240
that with tighter control on your

238
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:57,199
environment you tend to see higher

239
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,959
yields and a more potent product

240
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:02,320
now each of these colored lines on the

241
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:03,759
graphs below represent a genotype

242
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,839
in the first graph

243
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:08,000
we see no plasticity

244
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:10,399
the environment has little to no effect

245
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,799
on how that gene is expressed

246
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:15,200
compared to the graph on the far right

247
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:18,479
where we see a strong genotype by

248
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,480
environment interaction

249
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:25,760
as cultivators we can take advantage of

250
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,959
the plasticity of certain phenotypic

251
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:29,439
traits

252
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:32,159
by altering the environment

253
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,240
to elicit certain responses in the crop

254
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:35,919
that are beneficial

255
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,919
now let's go through a few examples of

256
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:39,919
this

257
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:41,919
anthocyanins

258
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:44,559
the pigments that are responsible for

259
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:46,879
all the purples pinks and colors we see

260
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:48,879
in cannabis flowers

261
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:51,439
you must have a cultivar

262
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:53,600
with the genetic potential to produce

263
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:56,160
these beautiful pigments

264
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,680
but if the plant is exposed to too high

265
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:59,120
of a temperature at the end of its

266
00:09:57,679 --> 00:10:01,439
flowering cycle

267
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,959
then you will not get a full expression

268
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,720
of these colors

269
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:06,239
and the proteins that produce them will

270
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,480
degrade

271
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,919
how cold do we need to get the room and

272
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,399
for how long

273
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:14,719
nobody really knows yet and it can vary

274
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,879
from cultivar to cultivar

275
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,720
but the colder we get the room

276
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:20,720
we know that the slower the metabolic

277
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,959
plate of the ramp will be

278
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,079
too cold for too long we could sacrifice

279
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:28,319
yield

280
00:10:24,078 --> 00:10:28,319
too warm we could lose some color

281
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,120
no really knows and it can vary from

282
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:35,039
cultivar to cultivar but the colder we

283
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,320
get the room the slower metabolic rate

284
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:38,319
of the plant will be

285
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,720
too cold for too long we could sacrifice

286
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,839
yield too warm and we could lose some

287
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,839
color

288
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:47,200
really it's a delicate balance to bring

289
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:49,600
out these colors in cannabis

290
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,680
another example is the day-to-night

291
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,079
temperature differential

292
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:56,319
with a warmer lights on temp

293
00:10:54,078 --> 00:10:58,719
and a cooler lights off temp

294
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:02,560
we have a positive diff

295
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:04,800
this promotes stem elongation or stretch

296
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:07,278
with a cooler lights on temp

297
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:09,359
and a warmer lights off temp

298
00:11:07,278 --> 00:11:11,919
we have a negative diff

299
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:14,720
this suppresses stem elongation

300
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:16,240
and for cultivars like gmo garlic

301
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,480
cookies

302
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,600
that stretch crazy the first three weeks

303
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,519
of flower

304
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,519
we can use this environmental crop

305
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,759
steering technique to keep them at a

306
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,679
manageable height

307
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:29,838
now there are many more examples of

308
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:31,199
environmental influences on phenotypic

309
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,200
expression

310
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,120
but more research is needed to determine

311
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:39,040
exactly which genes are influenced by

312
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,039
the environment and those that are not

313
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:44,799
one of the most fun things to do as a

314
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:47,039
cannabis grower is popping seeds and

315
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:50,000
hunting for a new pheno

316
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:52,719
with inbred lines of corn or soy

317
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:56,159
you pop a million seeds and all those

318
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:57,920
plants will look and yield very similar

319
00:11:56,159 --> 00:12:00,078
but due to the variability in the

320
00:11:57,919 --> 00:12:02,159
cannabis genome and the lack of

321
00:12:00,078 --> 00:12:04,479
professional breeding to stabilize

322
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:06,799
genetics at this point in the industry

323
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:10,399
primarily due to prohibition

324
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:13,599
a pack of just 10 or 12 seeds with

325
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:16,078
slightly different yet related genotypes

326
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,440
will yield a huge variability between

327
00:12:16,078 --> 00:12:18,559
plants

328
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,360
therefore

329
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:23,919
most growers utilize clones

330
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:26,240
but before you can use clones you must

331
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:28,240
find a phenotype with enough desirable

332
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,560
traits to keep in your staple as a

333
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:34,399
mother plant

334
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:37,119
so the process goes something like this

335
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:39,600
let's say i get a pack of 10 regular

336
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,839
seeds from the same cross

337
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,560
they all germinate

338
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:46,959
and then i arbitrarily label them 1

339
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:48,719
through 10 to keep track

340
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:51,679
they continue to grow

341
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:54,959
and eventually start showing their sex

342
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:57,919
dang it i got four males and i'm not

343
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:59,759
looking to breed so i coal six through

344
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:00,958
nine

345
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:03,278
shucks

346
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:06,078
number 10 was from aphrodite

347
00:13:03,278 --> 00:13:08,480
which is a sign of unstable genetics and

348
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:10,399
i don't want pollen in my flowering room

349
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,159
let's toss it

350
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:14,639
looks like on this final hunt i have

351
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:17,600
five females to hunt through

352
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:19,278
so they continue to flower and begin

353
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:22,000
showing the full extent of their

354
00:13:19,278 --> 00:13:24,000
phenotypic expression

355
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,360
three through five start showing some

356
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,639
purple

357
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:30,800
one and two stay more green

358
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,839
phenols one and two have a cakey terp

359
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:33,919
profile

360
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:36,399
and three through five smell like i just

361
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:37,519
opened my gas tank

362
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:42,240
but wait

363
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:44,560
pheno3 is gassy and cakey i like that

364
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,000
and maybe phenols one three and five had

365
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:47,278
a pretty good yield at the end of the

366
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,198
day

367
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:53,439
but fino 3

368
00:13:49,198 --> 00:13:53,439
had everything i was looking for

369
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,759
she is the keeper of the bunch

370
00:13:57,278 --> 00:14:01,360
and i decided to call her gas cake

371
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:03,278
number three

372
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,039
and that's a simple explanation of how

373
00:14:03,278 --> 00:14:07,759
growers go about hunting for good

374
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:07,759
phenotypes

375
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,799
all of the popular phenotypes of gelato

376
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:15,278
is another great example

377
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:18,000
originally bred in northern california

378
00:14:15,278 --> 00:14:21,360
with genetics from the cookie family and

379
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,600
mario guzman aka sherbinski

380
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,680
it is a cross of sunset sherbert and

381
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,440
thin mint girl scout cookies

382
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:30,239
then they collected all the seeds from

383
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:32,160
that cross and hunted for finos

384
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,240
for simplicity's sake

385
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:37,198
let's say there were 100 seeds in this

386
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:41,360
hunt labeled one through 100.

387
00:14:37,198 --> 00:14:43,759
it just so happened that numbers 33 41

388
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:46,159
43 and so on

389
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:48,559
really stood out as being special

390
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:50,480
so special that they each got their own

391
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:53,198
unique name

392
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:56,560
gelato 33 became larry bird

393
00:14:53,198 --> 00:14:59,278
and gelato 41 my favorite fino gelato

394
00:14:56,559 --> 00:15:01,198
became bacio gelato

395
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:03,759
they had mother plants for each of these

396
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:05,759
phenotypes cloned them and disseminated

397
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:08,000
them throughout the industry

398
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:09,600
but again do not expect to see this

399
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,159
level of quality in every batch of

400
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,159
gelato you picked up at the dispensary

401
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:16,958
it all comes back to the environment

402
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:16,958
they are grown in

403
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:22,000
now there are so many other qualities to

404
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:24,480
look out for in a good phenotype than

405
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,399
just color aroma and yield

406
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,360
and this slide just shows a few of those

407
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,720
traits

408
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:32,159
that growers and breeders look out for

409
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,920
and with that

410
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:36,000
i'd like to pass the mic over my good

411
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:37,919
friend jesse and have him take it away

412
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,320
from here

413
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:42,000
great info per usual deus always great

414
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,240
to hear you talk about the science of

415
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,639
phenotypic expression and i think the

416
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,799
gelato example you chose is a great one

417
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:51,519
because it resonates with cultivators

418
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:54,240
brokers and buyers alike

419
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:56,078
think about sales for a second currently

420
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,560
the sell-through numbers and customer

421
00:15:56,078 --> 00:16:00,078
preference is based on thc content and

422
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:03,518
name recognition

423
00:16:00,078 --> 00:16:05,278
for example gelato 33 could be worth

424
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:07,440
three to five hundred dollars more per

425
00:16:05,278 --> 00:16:08,879
pound than gelato 49

426
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,680
but why

427
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:13,919
it has appeal for a number of reasons

428
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:16,638
name recognition and hype blood

429
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:20,000
structure thc content

430
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:21,519
nose color and intense effects

431
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,399
but what if all of a sudden there was a

432
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:27,440
discovery proving that the chemo type of

433
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:29,360
gelato 49 was the best medicine for ms

434
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,920
or a particular cancer

435
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:34,480
the entourage effect and the relational

436
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:36,639
proportions of the secondary metabolites

437
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,800
would increase its value

438
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:40,240
if that were the case gelato 49 might

439
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:43,039
now get you three to five hundred

440
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:45,759
dollars more per pound than gelato 33

441
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:48,240
all based on phenotypic expression

442
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:51,039
and that's one reason why phenotypes

443
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,639
coas and environmental control are so

444
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:53,599
important for the future of cannabis

445
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,799
medicine

446
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:58,639
and success in the cannabis marketplace

447
00:16:56,799 --> 00:17:00,078
here you see a list of traits that many

448
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:02,799
people consider when breeding or

449
00:17:00,078 --> 00:17:05,599
selecting for commercial cultivation

450
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:08,318
i'll admit i'm a trait chaser

451
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:10,719
and to be honest i've chucked pollen

452
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:12,639
hunted and done generations of line work

453
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,240
to find cultivars resistant to broad

454
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,319
mites in oakland or

455
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,959
rude aphids in colorado

456
00:17:16,318 --> 00:17:21,438
i've chased faster finishing times

457
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:23,199
better production under leds

458
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:25,120
i've selected phenotypes because they

459
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:27,600
rooted faster for my commercial clone

460
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:29,918
operation or produce more thc and terps

461
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:31,759
to win cannabis competitions

462
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:34,000
i've found genetics that produce higher

463
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:36,160
yields above 5000 feet

464
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,839
and ones that are drought tolerant

465
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,080
and anders always reminds me the

466
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:42,879
importance of trichome size and cuticle

467
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:44,798
thickness for my solventless extracts

468
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,960
the result of the laborious and

469
00:17:44,798 --> 00:17:49,119
time-consuming phenohunts

470
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:51,840
led to healthier plants geared towards

471
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:54,239
my environments with better effects both

472
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:56,639
medically and recreationally

473
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,839
these decisions have directly impacted

474
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:01,360
the financial success of my cannabis

475
00:17:58,839 --> 00:18:03,119
businesses prioritizing the traits that

476
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:05,038
have the most impact on your business

477
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:08,239
plan and goals should be something

478
00:18:05,038 --> 00:18:08,240
you're always considering

479
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:16,000
and this brings us to key performance

480
00:18:12,839 --> 00:18:18,079
indicators kpis are how we benchmark the

481
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
performance of our phenotypes and our

482
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:21,599
cannabis businesses

483
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,079
it's a great way to determine the

484
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:25,918
efficiency of your facility as a whole

485
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:28,240
as well as your ability to capture

486
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:30,480
phenotypic expression

487
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:33,279
there are primary secondary and even

488
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:35,200
tertiary kpis that should be considered

489
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:36,558
but we wanted to focus on a few big ones

490
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,880
here

491
00:18:36,558 --> 00:18:40,240
first let's talk about kpis that measure

492
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,480
quantity

493
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,720
grams per square foot is one that we all

494
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,960
know and used to measure yield

495
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:49,360
how much biomass did we generate per

496
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,120
canopy square foot

497
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:53,599
another measure of quantity plus

498
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:56,079
efficiency is grams per watt

499
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:58,558
how much biomass do we generate relative

500
00:18:56,079 --> 00:19:01,279
to energy consumed

501
00:18:58,558 --> 00:19:03,519
and a third quantity kpi

502
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:06,240
is leaf to trim ratio

503
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:09,119
a cultivar with less leaf will be easier

504
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:11,839
to trim produce less shake and give you

505
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:13,759
more sellable flour per square foot

506
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:15,439
these are great measurements but the

507
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:18,480
deeper question is

508
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:21,038
did we optimize environmental conditions

509
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:23,279
to get the most possible cell sellable

510
00:19:21,038 --> 00:19:26,319
weight from our phenotype

511
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:29,599
next we have kpis that measure quality

512
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:31,678
like active compounds per gram per watt

513
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:33,359
and per square foot

514
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:35,679
the question here is

515
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:37,839
did we maximize secondary metabolite

516
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:39,519
production relative to

517
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:42,480
and if we cure it appropriately to

518
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:44,400
protect those desired compounds

519
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,240
the active compounds you collect will

520
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,400
directly impact the price per pound of

521
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,679
your sellable flour and your extract

522
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,320
yields

523
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:54,880
any buyer will tell you gelato the tests

524
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:58,079
at 20 percent thc is just not as

525
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:59,919
valuable as gelato the tests above 30.

526
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:00,879
and any concentrate manufacturer will

527
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:03,759
tell you

528
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:05,440
it's fire in fire out

529
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:07,759
those are the market and production

530
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:10,159
expectations from a phenotypic

531
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:13,279
expression perspective

532
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:14,799
another kpi is harvest cycles per year

533
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:17,119
and refers to the length of time it

534
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:19,519
takes your cultivar to finish

535
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:21,839
it will impact your speed to market and

536
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:23,679
your plant flow process

537
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:26,319
finding a phenotype that allows you to

538
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:28,880
harvest one more cycle per year can

539
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:31,439
transform a business

540
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:33,919
maximizing quantity and quality will get

541
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:36,880
you the lowest cost of production and

542
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:38,480
the most efficient production facility

543
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,640
and let's be honest

544
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,720
anyone can get one good run

545
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,400
but the key to long-term success is

546
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,640
consistency

547
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:49,038
consistent excellence comes from

548
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,960
accurate data collection per cultivar

549
00:20:49,038 --> 00:20:53,038
and optimizing their expression with

550
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,960
environmental control

551
00:20:53,038 --> 00:20:58,480
consistency is the difference between a

552
00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:00,960
good batch and a good brand

553
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:03,599
consistent environment equates

554
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:05,759
and equals consistent customer

555
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:07,199
experience and predictable production

556
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:09,359
levels

557
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,720
but these kpis also speak to the value

558
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:12,639
of a gram

559
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,440
what's a gram really worth

560
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,600
well

561
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,279
it depends on who you ask

562
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:19,918
with fifteen thousand square feet of

563
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:21,519
canopy and five turns a year

564
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:23,520
and a twenty five hundred dollar price

565
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:25,119
per pound one gram is worth four hundred

566
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:27,440
thousand dollars

567
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:29,519
with six turns a year it's five hundred

568
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,840
thousand dollars

569
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:34,000
if you can optimize genetics and get a

570
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:35,599
few more hundred dollars per pound

571
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,679
one gram will be worth more than six

572
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:40,240
hundred thousand dollars

573
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:41,759
now squeeze out one extra cycle with the

574
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,279
right phenotype

575
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:45,839
and it could be seven hundred thousand

576
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:48,158
dollars and remember we're just talking

577
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:50,959
about one gram

578
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:53,200
phenotypic expression is key to getting

579
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:55,600
you the highest price per pound possible

580
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,759
and the best yield but it also impacts

581
00:21:55,599 --> 00:22:00,798
your brand

582
00:21:57,759 --> 00:22:03,519
expression is what customers are buying

583
00:22:00,798 --> 00:22:06,240
and the stable of phenotypes you produce

584
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:09,839
gives you strategic pricing per cultivar

585
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:11,839
like the gelato example we used earlier

586
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:13,519
but that expression also translates to

587
00:22:11,839 --> 00:22:15,279
cannabis awards

588
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:16,639
influences the price a customer is

589
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:18,879
willing to pay

590
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,720
how much they buy and ultimately the

591
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:23,039
financial success of cultivators

592
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:25,200
distributors and dispensaries

593
00:22:23,038 --> 00:22:26,879
it also plays a major role in customer

594
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,798
satisfaction

595
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:31,919
which leads us to the importance of see

596
00:22:28,798 --> 00:22:31,918
importance of coas

597
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:37,119
coas gets you paid

598
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:39,759
and they help create action plans

599
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:41,678
but they also save lives

600
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:43,440
coas are how current purchasing

601
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:45,679
decisions are being made at the

602
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,720
commercial level and how we begin to

603
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:49,280
correlate

604
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:51,120
medical efficacy to secondary metabolite

605
00:22:49,279 --> 00:22:53,599
production

606
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:56,000
this this is an example of measured

607
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:58,240
cannabinoids and terpenes or what we

608
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,159
know as chemotype that anders had

609
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,319
mentioned earlier

610
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:05,760
this particular example is of fatso

611
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:08,639
which tested at 44 thc

612
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:11,359
and 3.1 percent terpenes

613
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:13,840
looking for a specific chemo type

614
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:16,959
profile can be a target for personalized

615
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:19,599
medicine or a recreational experience

616
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:22,000
that helps determine value

617
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:24,879
and as a former commercial buyer for

618
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,400
dispensaries these this this game used

619
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,400
to be different

620
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:31,360
a cultivator would bring in 10 pounds or

621
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:33,440
so into my office drop it on my desk i'd

622
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:37,359
squish the bud between my fingers give

623
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:39,679
it the nose test the i test roll it up

624
00:23:37,359 --> 00:23:41,119
see how it burned and then give my value

625
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:43,519
assessment

626
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:46,000
now value assessments are based on

627
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:48,319
the numbers provided by coas

628
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,798
and even medical research is driven by

629
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:52,480
chemotype information

630
00:23:50,798 --> 00:23:54,639
purchases today

631
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,960
are based on percentages

632
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:59,520
not personal relationships

633
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:02,319
so how do we improve our coas and

634
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:05,839
monetize the value of a test result

635
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:05,839
environmental control

636
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:12,960
quality quantity consistency and

637
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,798
efficiency is about optimizing all 10

638
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,240
current cardinal parameters in this

639
00:24:14,798 --> 00:24:18,400
space

640
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,400
and we could go through all 10 but i

641
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,400
think we will save that deeper dive for

642
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,559
another webinar but i do think this

643
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:26,320
slide does help illustrate the impact of

644
00:24:24,558 --> 00:24:28,558
environmental conditions

645
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:31,200
and phenotypic expression on a larger

646
00:24:28,558 --> 00:24:33,200
scale facility design

647
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:35,120
lighting is a great example

648
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:37,519
we think spectrum control will help you

649
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:40,399
produce more terpenes and people are

650
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:42,158
choosing to pursue high ppfd lighting

651
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,320
because the science tells us that it

652
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:46,240
will equate to more yield

653
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:48,798
but increasing light quality and

654
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:53,200
quantity will mean more transpiration

655
00:24:48,798 --> 00:24:55,679
more co2 and likely a higher ec

656
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:57,919
but what is the leaf temp offset

657
00:24:55,679 --> 00:25:00,159
relative to your lighting choice

658
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:02,960
controlling vpd isn't as simple as

659
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:06,080
picking a temp and humidity setpoint

660
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:08,960
in order to use vpd effectively you have

661
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:10,879
to control the temperature of the leaf

662
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,880
with that knowledge how do we measure

663
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:15,919
and maintain ambient conditions to

664
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:18,320
optimize the plant's photosynthetic rate

665
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:21,038
can we deliver co2 with the appropriate

666
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:22,720
velocities directly to the plant stomata

667
00:25:21,038 --> 00:25:24,158
to drive the utilization of these

668
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,240
photons

669
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:28,400
how do we adjust fertigation strategies

670
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:31,038
and airflow to optimize the performance

671
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,480
of each cultivar in a high ppfd

672
00:25:31,038 --> 00:25:34,000
environment

673
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,079
we're just getting started and this is

674
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,640
only one parameter

675
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:41,519
environmental crop steering is the key

676
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:44,240
to getting the best coas and it's backed

677
00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:46,720
by scientific research

678
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:49,038
during the flower period we can induce

679
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,880
drought stress with controlled dry backs

680
00:25:49,038 --> 00:25:52,079
to increase secondary metabolite

681
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,960
production

682
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:57,359
we can acidify the media and lower temps

683
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:59,440
to produce anthocyanins

684
00:25:57,359 --> 00:26:02,719
we can increase ec

685
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:05,519
increase vpd and reduce feed duration

686
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:06,640
with measurable positive results

687
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:08,639
however

688
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,960
your ability to impla apply

689
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,880
environmental crop steering techniques

690
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,720
is only possible with precision

691
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,400
environmental control

692
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:19,200
without control

693
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:21,600
it's just stress

694
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:23,919
focus on control of all 10 cardinal

695
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:26,558
parameters and you can design a facility

696
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:27,919
to drive any cultivar that the market

697
00:26:26,558 --> 00:26:30,639
demands

698
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:32,400
build a facility with limited control

699
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:35,679
and the choice of high performing

700
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:37,200
cultivars will also be limited

701
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:38,559
the 10 cardinal parameters are a

702
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:41,519
symphony

703
00:26:38,558 --> 00:26:43,839
get it wrong and your band is off key

704
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:47,119
get it right and you have a masterpiece

705
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:48,720
that everyone is excited to experience

706
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:50,239
the biggest limiting factor for

707
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,600
phenotypic expression is your

708
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,759
environment

709
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:55,839
and environment control environmental

710
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:58,319
control is 50 percent

711
00:26:55,839 --> 00:26:59,918
of what makes up a phenotype and a

712
00:26:58,319 --> 00:27:02,960
hundred percent

713
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:05,278
of what makes each cultivar special is

714
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:07,519
phenotypic expression

715
00:27:05,278 --> 00:27:09,599
it's all about control and what you do

716
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:11,200
with the control that drives plant

717
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:13,199
expression increases financial

718
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,400
performance so that's why it's so

719
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,159
important to think about these

720
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,480
interactions when it comes to building

721
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:20,480
your cannabis business

722
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,798
with that i think we want to really

723
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:25,200
thank everyone for listening to us talk

724
00:27:22,798 --> 00:27:27,119
about the plant that we love so much

725
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:29,278
and obviously we'd love to hear from the

726
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:30,879
community on future webinars that we can

727
00:27:29,278 --> 00:27:33,359
dive into

728
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,960
and express some experiences about but

729
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:36,959
from here i think we're gonna spend

730
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,880
another 30 minutes or so

731
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,319
to jump into some questions and answers

732
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,240
from the community

733
00:27:40,319 --> 00:27:45,119
so with that let's turn it over to brian

734
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,120
and jump right in

735
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:51,440
thanks jesse thanks anders i was really

736
00:27:48,558 --> 00:27:53,119
good guys and i'm super excited to jump

737
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:55,440
into q a with you

738
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:58,079
um but to get things kicked off uh your

739
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:00,159
presentation spurred a thought for me

740
00:27:58,079 --> 00:28:01,678
it reminded me how closely plants are

741
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:03,600
related to humans

742
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:05,278
i mean essentially we're talking about

743
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:07,439
the evolution of the cannabis genome

744
00:28:05,278 --> 00:28:09,038
here and it's just like the nature

745
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,880
versus nurtured conversation we have

746
00:28:09,038 --> 00:28:12,319
about children

747
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,080
a child could be born with the best

748
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:16,158
genetic makeup but without a good

749
00:28:14,079 --> 00:28:17,759
environment they may never realize their

750
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:20,080
full potential

751
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:21,679
so with that in mind i'm wondering

752
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:25,759
what environmental parameters have the

753
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:25,759
biggest impact on phenotypic expression

754
00:28:26,398 --> 00:28:30,639
well first of all i love that analogy

755
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:32,960
you made with your kids and

756
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,720
one thing i like to think about with

757
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,079
plants first people is there's a lot of

758
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,880
corollaries

759
00:28:36,079 --> 00:28:38,079
but

760
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,640
people can

761
00:28:38,079 --> 00:28:42,639
are mobile and plants are cecil so

762
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:45,120
people can move out of undesirable

763
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:46,880
environments into a more preferable one

764
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:49,119
but plants have to have all these

765
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:51,278
mechanisms to adapt to poor

766
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:53,839
environmental conditions

767
00:28:51,278 --> 00:28:56,798
now which environmental parameter which

768
00:28:53,839 --> 00:28:59,599
parameter in general

769
00:28:56,798 --> 00:29:02,079
has the most influence

770
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:04,000
i wouldn't say it's just one like jesse

771
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:06,960
said with 10 cardinal parameters to me

772
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:09,679
it's a symphony of balancing all of them

773
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:13,120
into the right parameters and ratios

774
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:15,038
to get the maximum phenotypic production

775
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:17,199
yeah i mean i think it's dangerous to

776
00:29:15,038 --> 00:29:19,519
focus on one they're all so

777
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:21,679
interconnected i mean it's so easy to

778
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:23,918
get excited about instagraming your

779
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:26,960
lights or your racks or your fertigation

780
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:28,880
skid or the cool facility you've built

781
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:31,360
but it's the interaction

782
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:33,440
and how one influences the other when we

783
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:34,798
talk about these parameters that really

784
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:37,360
ultimately

785
00:29:34,798 --> 00:29:39,359
give us the phenotypic expression

786
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:40,959
so you can't adjust one without the

787
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:44,558
other and understanding that

788
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:48,319
relationship is just as important in

789
00:29:44,558 --> 00:29:48,319
investing in one wholeheartedly

790
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:55,439
yeah that makes sense

791
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:58,159
i guess it's part of the the

792
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:01,278
challenge the huge challenge and and the

793
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:02,559
potential reward that uh cultivators

794
00:30:01,278 --> 00:30:03,919
have

795
00:30:02,558 --> 00:30:05,519
just because there's just such a

796
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:08,080
multi-disciplinary challenge and there's

797
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:09,519
so many parameters to take into account

798
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:11,759
and

799
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:14,079
it's also genetic specific right it

800
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:16,480
depends on that the parameters depend on

801
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:18,960
what genetics you're growing as well

802
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:20,960
definitely i mean you can have the

803
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:23,278
coolest irrigation most precise

804
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:25,120
irrigation fertigation system

805
00:30:23,278 --> 00:30:27,278
ever but if you can't control

806
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:30,479
temperature and relative humidity you

807
00:30:27,278 --> 00:30:32,079
can't drive that transpiration rate um

808
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:34,480
you know move nutrients throughout the

809
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:36,079
plant and just drive the metabolic rate

810
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:38,640
of the plant in general so it's a

811
00:30:36,079 --> 00:30:41,839
limiting factor game really

812
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:44,080
and it's joke that i used to make is um

813
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:45,199
you know give me antiquated lighting

814
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:48,000
styles

815
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:49,840
cheap nutrients recycled media but let

816
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,359
me control the environment and i'm

817
00:30:49,839 --> 00:30:53,119
always going to get to the finish line

818
00:30:51,359 --> 00:30:54,639
and with a great product

819
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:57,439
and i guess what i mean by that is your

820
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:59,840
biggest limiting factor is hvac which is

821
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:02,480
why in a lot of ways you know hvac

822
00:30:59,839 --> 00:31:04,798
became hvac became like a four letter

823
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:07,200
word for me in the industry for so long

824
00:31:04,798 --> 00:31:09,918
not having purpose-built technology or

825
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,440
the tools at my disposal to optimize all

826
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:13,519
the other parameters

827
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:15,440
it was that everything was limited

828
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:16,960
by my lack of investment or lack of

829
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:20,399
access to technology from an

830
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:20,399
environmental control standpoint

831
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:25,759
environmental control is your best form

832
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:29,918
of crop insurance it's uh one

833
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:29,919
wise sage once told us i think

834
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:33,600
always

835
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:36,319
speaking of uh genetics uh there's a

836
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:38,639
really interesting question here um

837
00:31:36,319 --> 00:31:41,519
from a member of our audience

838
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:44,320
asking about your opinion on indica and

839
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:47,319
sativa classification versus chemo bar

840
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:47,319
classification

841
00:31:49,038 --> 00:31:52,960
do you do we already see a shift in the

842
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:55,439
industry towards chemo-bar

843
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:58,399
classification versus the traditional

844
00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:00,798
indica versus sativa geography type of

845
00:31:58,398 --> 00:32:02,319
classification yeah that's a great

846
00:32:00,798 --> 00:32:03,200
question

847
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:05,278
um

848
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:07,278
i think we all kind of learned that the

849
00:32:05,278 --> 00:32:10,000
traditional indica

850
00:32:07,278 --> 00:32:12,798
sativa hybrid classification

851
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:15,038
there's no real genetic basis for it

852
00:32:12,798 --> 00:32:16,398
it's one species

853
00:32:15,038 --> 00:32:18,079
and

854
00:32:16,398 --> 00:32:20,558
you know we're learning that there needs

855
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:23,359
to be a new way to group these cultivars

856
00:32:20,558 --> 00:32:25,278
and on the shelf and then also in for

857
00:32:23,359 --> 00:32:27,439
medical purposes

858
00:32:25,278 --> 00:32:31,200
i think for medicinal purposes and

859
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:34,480
recreational grouping them by chemotypes

860
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:36,399
type 1 type 2 type 3 type 4 type 5

861
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:38,480
plants in general

862
00:32:36,398 --> 00:32:40,959
is a good first step

863
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:43,440
but i don't think it takes into account

864
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:45,519
all of the nuances that we need to use

865
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:47,038
to describe these plants

866
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:49,120
um

867
00:32:47,038 --> 00:32:51,119
in general and so i

868
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:53,359
it's definitely a big area i've seen

869
00:32:51,119 --> 00:32:57,038
some groups in the industry try and put

870
00:32:53,359 --> 00:32:58,558
forth their own nomenclature and ways of

871
00:32:57,038 --> 00:33:00,798
you know grouping these different

872
00:32:58,558 --> 00:33:02,798
cultivars

873
00:33:00,798 --> 00:33:04,639
i haven't ever seen one fully get

874
00:33:02,798 --> 00:33:06,319
adopted yet

875
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:08,080
and i can't wait because it's going to

876
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:10,480
help dispensaries

877
00:33:08,079 --> 00:33:13,278
a ton being able to put these on the

878
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:14,558
shelves in a more accurate way

879
00:33:13,278 --> 00:33:15,839
and it'll help

880
00:33:14,558 --> 00:33:18,240
you know

881
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:20,319
patients and consumers be able to

882
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:22,159
purchase more wisely

883
00:33:20,319 --> 00:33:24,079
i foresee a

884
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:26,640
nomenclature that has to do with the

885
00:33:24,079 --> 00:33:28,558
dominant cannabinoid and then also

886
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:30,880
paired with the dominant terpene in that

887
00:33:28,558 --> 00:33:32,480
profile so that we can understand the

888
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:34,559
entourage effect

889
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:36,880
but i think until we do more research on

890
00:33:34,558 --> 00:33:38,558
those interactions that produce these

891
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:41,200
entourage effects

892
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:44,079
there's not going to be a good system

893
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:46,960
so and i think the relational proportion

894
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:48,960
of those terpenes too and understanding

895
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:51,600
the entourage effect and

896
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:53,600
what percentage of beta-carot

897
00:33:51,599 --> 00:33:56,398
beta-carotelline relative to another

898
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:58,480
terpene or whatever it may be from a

899
00:33:56,398 --> 00:34:00,479
scientific application and formulary

900
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:02,558
perspective or a

901
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:04,558
you know recreational perspective

902
00:34:02,558 --> 00:34:06,639
as a guy who ran dispensaries it was so

903
00:34:04,558 --> 00:34:08,800
easy to train staff a long time ago

904
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:10,559
where you say this is an indica it's

905
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:13,359
going to give you couchslock this is a

906
00:34:10,559 --> 00:34:15,519
sativa it's going to make you creative

907
00:34:13,358 --> 00:34:17,519
and that was more of a marketing ploy

908
00:34:15,519 --> 00:34:19,679
you have so many poly hybrids in this

909
00:34:17,519 --> 00:34:22,159
space now that it's really about

910
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:23,838
understanding the chemo type and being

911
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:26,720
able to read that certificate of

912
00:34:23,838 --> 00:34:28,320
authenticity or analysis to determine

913
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:30,719
what the best medicine or best

914
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:32,240
recreational product is for someone and

915
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:34,959
i just don't think there's enough good

916
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:37,039
research out there to educate the

917
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:39,679
consumer there's certainly a movement

918
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:42,800
where people are coming in looking for

919
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:45,280
you know particular things but

920
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:47,119
that dialogue isn't deep and rich enough

921
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:49,679
yet for a customer to come in and say

922
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:50,720
hey i'm looking for these four terpenes

923
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:53,119
because

924
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:55,519
my endocannabinoid you know receptors

925
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:57,119
react a certain way and as a result

926
00:34:55,519 --> 00:34:58,880
that's what i want to take on the boat

927
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:01,200
when i go fishing or that's what i want

928
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:03,280
to use to write my novel

929
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:04,639
so there's a lot of challenges but the

930
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:06,720
more research we get and the more

931
00:35:04,639 --> 00:35:09,598
correlations we get i think we'll better

932
00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:11,439
have the language to really satisfy the

933
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:13,280
consumers in the space

934
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:15,599
yep and at the end of the day everything

935
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:18,160
we buy dispenser is a hybrid now there

936
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:19,440
are no indicas and sativas we have i

937
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:21,199
mean we have indicas that give you

938
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:23,358
sativa-like effects

939
00:35:21,199 --> 00:35:25,679
and things labeled sativa that give you

940
00:35:23,358 --> 00:35:27,920
indica-like effects i mean it's a mess

941
00:35:25,679 --> 00:35:31,279
so there needs to be a better system

942
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:33,519
and to circle back with the the relation

943
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:35,040
of cannabis to humans

944
00:35:33,519 --> 00:35:37,358
it all depends on our own

945
00:35:35,039 --> 00:35:40,000
endocannabinoid system as well right

946
00:35:37,358 --> 00:35:41,679
yeah what what gives you couch lock may

947
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,639
give me anxiety

948
00:35:41,679 --> 00:35:46,159
what helps alleviate a certain condition

949
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:48,239
for you may

950
00:35:46,159 --> 00:35:49,679
exacerbate it or may not give me any

951
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:52,000
curative effects

952
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:54,960
that's exactly right and the research

953
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:57,440
being done in israel on

954
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:59,760
using cannabinoids to

955
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:02,159
fight cancer they're finding that these

956
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:04,880
ratios and quantities of different

957
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:08,799
terpenes and cannabinoid you know

958
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:11,119
together is very specific to that form

959
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:12,880
of cancer and that person and it's a

960
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:15,519
huge challenge figuring out with all

961
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:17,599
these permutations what is right for you

962
00:36:15,519 --> 00:36:18,480
and your ailment and your disease so

963
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:20,160
it's a

964
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:22,000
it's a lot of research yeah

965
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:23,118
it's exciting though

966
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,920
i mean

967
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:28,000
140 or 150 different cannabinoids in

968
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:29,920
cannabis and we're focused on

969
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,920
two or three of them right now well

970
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:34,159
that's because of prohibition

971
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:36,559
right i mean we

972
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:38,559
accidentally selected for high thc

973
00:36:36,559 --> 00:36:40,239
cultivars for decades

974
00:36:38,559 --> 00:36:41,920
and now we're having to bring back those

975
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:43,519
other genes and get them expressed in

976
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,800
higher quantities

977
00:36:43,519 --> 00:36:46,800
um

978
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:49,039
yeah it's just going to take time

979
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:50,079
to catch up

980
00:36:49,039 --> 00:36:54,159
yeah

981
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:57,440
yeah and so your points about um well

982
00:36:54,159 --> 00:36:58,879
the plasticity of phenotypes

983
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:00,320
maybe you guys could talk a little bit

984
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,039
about

985
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:03,680
the

986
00:37:01,039 --> 00:37:07,358
chemical composition

987
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:09,759
or the chemo bars and the ability to

988
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:10,960
manipulate those potentially or

989
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:13,760
express

990
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:14,720
the the chemical composition differently

991
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,240
through

992
00:37:14,719 --> 00:37:18,799
through environmental

993
00:37:16,239 --> 00:37:18,799
practices

994
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:24,480
the way i like to think about it is the

995
00:37:23,039 --> 00:37:26,800
essential

996
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:29,519
dominating cannabinoids and terpenes are

997
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:31,200
genetically determined the basic ratio

998
00:37:29,519 --> 00:37:33,599
of what that plant can produce is

999
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:35,919
determined at the genotype level

1000
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:38,079
but the overall quantity that you get at

1001
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:39,680
the end of the day is highly determined

1002
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:42,720
by the environment

1003
00:37:39,679 --> 00:37:46,078
so i can have a two to one

1004
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:48,319
thc to cbd ratio cultivar

1005
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:51,200
but i might only get

1006
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:53,680
you know ten percent thc five percent

1007
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:57,039
cbd or with a better environment i can

1008
00:37:53,679 --> 00:37:59,679
make that ratio 20 to 10 right so we can

1009
00:37:57,039 --> 00:38:00,880
get higher potency but with similar

1010
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:02,639
ratios

1011
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:04,480
it doesn't always hold true but that's

1012
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:06,000
kind of the generally the way i like to

1013
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:08,320
think about it

1014
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,760
yeah i mean i think anecdotally

1015
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:12,320
historically there's always been

1016
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:14,880
conversations about plant stress

1017
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:17,359
increasing some sort of aspect

1018
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:20,079
that we want in the final product you

1019
00:38:17,358 --> 00:38:21,920
know whether it's a book from the 1970s

1020
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:25,519
talking about sticking something through

1021
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:27,440
the stem in order to get higher thc

1022
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:30,559
i think now we've really evolved the

1023
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:32,320
concept of stress to

1024
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:34,639
embody what we're trying to do from an

1025
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:35,760
environmental crop steering perspective

1026
00:38:34,639 --> 00:38:37,759
and

1027
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:39,440
you know we have these stresses but

1028
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:42,400
controlling the stresses and

1029
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:44,400
understanding the cost-benefit analysis

1030
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:47,119
of applying these stresses

1031
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:49,920
is the important part and you know you

1032
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:51,519
might have some sort of aspect of stress

1033
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,960
let's call it temperature that brings

1034
00:38:51,519 --> 00:38:56,000
out color

1035
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:59,039
and we bring that in in the late stages

1036
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:01,599
we have to understand the customer and

1037
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:03,679
the business and does that temperature

1038
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:06,320
stress equate to

1039
00:39:03,679 --> 00:39:08,399
more performance not necessarily right

1040
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:10,079
we're slowing the plant's metabolic rate

1041
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:12,800
so we're going to probably compromise

1042
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:15,039
our biomass accumulation

1043
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:16,960
but does it give us more bag appeal that

1044
00:39:15,039 --> 00:39:19,679
raises the price per pound or gets

1045
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:21,440
people more excited in the market for it

1046
00:39:19,679 --> 00:39:23,759
it's a balance

1047
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:26,639
so many of those cannabis these delicate

1048
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:28,640
bounces with cultivation in general

1049
00:39:26,639 --> 00:39:30,960
and really like to me the the phenos big

1050
00:39:28,639 --> 00:39:33,440
plasticity the ability of these genes to

1051
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:35,599
be influenced by the environment is the

1052
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:37,519
prerequisite and really

1053
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:39,359
what gives us the ability to employ

1054
00:39:37,519 --> 00:39:41,199
environmental crops during techniques

1055
00:39:39,358 --> 00:39:43,519
you know like we're taking advantage of

1056
00:39:41,199 --> 00:39:46,239
that and we're able to

1057
00:39:43,519 --> 00:39:48,079
steer that crop into a way that is

1058
00:39:46,239 --> 00:39:49,358
more beneficial for our facility and our

1059
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:51,519
business

1060
00:39:49,358 --> 00:39:52,799
for plant health

1061
00:39:51,519 --> 00:39:54,559
yeah

1062
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:57,359
there's a question here on autoflowers

1063
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:59,440
guys um pros and cons of commercially

1064
00:39:57,358 --> 00:40:01,920
growing autoflowers

1065
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,920
thoughts there

1066
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:06,880
i like the commercial viability part so

1067
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:10,559
i can avoid some of my personal opinions

1068
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:12,880
on consuming autoflowers but i think

1069
00:40:10,559 --> 00:40:14,880
for me as a guy who's been you know an

1070
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:16,880
outdoor cultivator with experience up

1071
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:19,039
north in the klamath area

1072
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:20,880
one of the reasons i love autoflowers it

1073
00:40:19,039 --> 00:40:22,960
allows me to sneak in another cycle

1074
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:24,559
every year and i can put out these

1075
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,920
autoflowers early i know when they're

1076
00:40:24,559 --> 00:40:27,199
going to harvest they're not triggered

1077
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,800
by the light

1078
00:40:27,199 --> 00:40:29,919
all of a sudden i get an additional

1079
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:32,800
harvest

1080
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:34,240
before i put out my large scale harvest

1081
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:36,640
so there's definitely a benefit to

1082
00:40:34,239 --> 00:40:38,879
autoflowers and you see a lot of

1083
00:40:36,639 --> 00:40:41,118
current publications and authors talking

1084
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:43,358
about the evolution of autoflowers

1085
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:45,519
getting better and better and better um

1086
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:47,598
realistically i mean it's it's a cross

1087
00:40:45,519 --> 00:40:48,480
with root or alice right it's across

1088
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:51,039
with

1089
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:53,280
um i lovingly say ditch wheat but

1090
00:40:51,039 --> 00:40:54,719
realistically there might be medical

1091
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:56,800
viability that's coming through

1092
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:58,879
autoflowers because of their willingness

1093
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,839
to sort of step back into this genetic

1094
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,760
pool

1095
00:40:59,838 --> 00:41:03,679
and pull out other secondary

1096
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:05,520
cannabinoids that right now are

1097
00:41:03,679 --> 00:41:07,679
currently not prized

1098
00:41:05,519 --> 00:41:10,719
so from a commercial viability

1099
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:12,480
perspective i like the run of it

1100
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:13,838
from a crop steering and plant

1101
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,880
management perspective it can be

1102
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:16,000
challenged

1103
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,920
challenged to run nothing but

1104
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,480
autoflowers in your space

1105
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:23,358
but from a genetic preservation

1106
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:25,760
perspective and billy the ability to

1107
00:41:23,358 --> 00:41:27,759
pull from that pool in looking for

1108
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:30,480
medicine i mean i think a lot about my

1109
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:32,480
mom who was sick with cancer right like

1110
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:34,719
when she was sick it was we weren't even

1111
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:36,480
talking about cbd that wasn't really

1112
00:41:34,719 --> 00:41:39,358
even a thing

1113
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:41,280
and for her to have consistent access to

1114
00:41:39,358 --> 00:41:43,679
medicine was a challenge

1115
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:46,480
so for me consistent phenotypic

1116
00:41:43,679 --> 00:41:49,199
expression and you know chemo bar

1117
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:51,519
analysis is really important for medical

1118
00:41:49,199 --> 00:41:54,480
viability people can go and

1119
00:41:51,519 --> 00:41:56,719
have an expected result from a product

1120
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:57,679
they get and

1121
00:41:56,719 --> 00:41:58,879
you know

1122
00:41:57,679 --> 00:42:01,199
you can think what you want about

1123
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:03,440
autoflowers but it's definitely a niche

1124
00:42:01,199 --> 00:42:05,118
part of this market that allows us to

1125
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:07,838
continue to grow and explore new

1126
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:09,519
business opportunities yeah

1127
00:42:07,838 --> 00:42:11,039
and from an extract perspective i'd love

1128
00:42:09,519 --> 00:42:12,639
to hear what you think anders because i

1129
00:42:11,039 --> 00:42:14,480
know a lot of guys up north that i know

1130
00:42:12,639 --> 00:42:15,598
are like hey let's run autoflower we're

1131
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:17,920
going to run everything through the

1132
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:20,000
press at the end of the the cycle and

1133
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:21,599
then we're going to run this big flower

1134
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,960
harvest and try and get nothing but

1135
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:27,200
cherries that go in a jar on the shelf

1136
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:29,838
but it diversifies their

1137
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:31,279
their market share

1138
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:33,838
i mean

1139
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:35,680
well in regards to that concentration

1140
00:42:33,838 --> 00:42:38,880
resin is resin whether it's not a flower

1141
00:42:35,679 --> 00:42:41,118
variety or not so if you grow good resin

1142
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:43,440
cleanly and surely and there's a lot of

1143
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:45,039
it then you can preserve that quality of

1144
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,240
that resin throughout the extraction

1145
00:42:45,039 --> 00:42:48,639
process

1146
00:42:46,239 --> 00:42:50,318
i don't see an issue with it

1147
00:42:48,639 --> 00:42:52,879
i am kind of

1148
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:55,838
blown away at how far autoflowers have

1149
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:56,800
progressed in the last decade or so

1150
00:42:55,838 --> 00:42:59,039
i mean

1151
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:01,359
i never really saw an autoflower that i

1152
00:42:59,039 --> 00:43:02,639
wanted to consume or grow or anything i

1153
00:43:01,358 --> 00:43:04,559
mean it just

1154
00:43:02,639 --> 00:43:06,159
wasn't that impressive to me

1155
00:43:04,559 --> 00:43:08,400
and lately there have been some

1156
00:43:06,159 --> 00:43:10,960
autoflower genetics that i'm like very

1157
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:12,639
interested in checking out

1158
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:14,240
in terms of growing it

1159
00:43:12,639 --> 00:43:17,118
you know uh

1160
00:43:14,239 --> 00:43:19,039
but in at a commercial indoor facility i

1161
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:21,358
see some challenges with autoflowers

1162
00:43:19,039 --> 00:43:22,800
because one of the biggest challenges of

1163
00:43:21,358 --> 00:43:25,679
running one of these large-scale

1164
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:27,519
facilities is scheduling and scheduling

1165
00:43:25,679 --> 00:43:30,159
the rotation of your rooms and your

1166
00:43:27,519 --> 00:43:31,838
crops from propagation to veg to

1167
00:43:30,159 --> 00:43:33,118
generative growth

1168
00:43:31,838 --> 00:43:34,318
and

1169
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:36,960
you know

1170
00:43:34,318 --> 00:43:38,960
the plasticity that we can play with by

1171
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:41,119
holding plants into a certain photo

1172
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:44,079
period and not having them flower

1173
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:45,920
automatically gives us some flexibility

1174
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:48,640
to hold things back

1175
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:51,358
with autoflowers we can't necessarily do

1176
00:43:48,639 --> 00:43:54,639
that because its clock has started it's

1177
00:43:51,358 --> 00:43:57,199
on a predetermined timeline for me but

1178
00:43:54,639 --> 00:43:59,118
with the ability to have photoperiod

1179
00:43:57,199 --> 00:44:00,159
sensitive plants

1180
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:02,880
you can have a little bit more

1181
00:44:00,159 --> 00:44:03,838
flexibility in your crop rotation

1182
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:06,720
um

1183
00:44:03,838 --> 00:44:08,480
holding things back in veg if you

1184
00:44:06,719 --> 00:44:09,679
you want to take that flower room an

1185
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:11,519
extra week

1186
00:44:09,679 --> 00:44:13,598
what have you

1187
00:44:11,519 --> 00:44:15,519
i do see some challenges in that side of

1188
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:18,000
autoflowers and the genetics need to

1189
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:20,400
catch up a little bit more in terms of

1190
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,239
plant vitality and expression

1191
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:25,119
i think that's coming but i also think

1192
00:44:22,239 --> 00:44:27,759
about sort of how people go about you

1193
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:30,400
know the autoflower process and it's

1194
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:32,800
usually trying to find feminized seeds

1195
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:34,559
and popping these feminized seeds and i

1196
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:36,640
think in a lot of ways because you don't

1197
00:44:34,559 --> 00:44:38,880
have this genetic mother stock for

1198
00:44:36,639 --> 00:44:40,159
consistency you're going to have genetic

1199
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,920
variability

1200
00:44:40,159 --> 00:44:43,679
until we get a higher progression of

1201
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:45,519
breeding in the autoflower in the

1202
00:44:43,679 --> 00:44:48,000
industry as a whole

1203
00:44:45,519 --> 00:44:50,400
it's hard to pop 200 autoflower seeds

1204
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,838
and expect them to all be the same yep

1205
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:54,400
so that's a challenge

1206
00:44:51,838 --> 00:44:55,519
from a go to market strategy as well

1207
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,200
totally

1208
00:44:55,519 --> 00:44:58,079
yeah interesting

1209
00:44:57,199 --> 00:45:00,318
um

1210
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:02,560
well maybe we can uh

1211
00:45:00,318 --> 00:45:05,920
shift gears here real quick and

1212
00:45:02,559 --> 00:45:06,880
talk about some facility specific items

1213
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:08,800
um

1214
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:10,800
what are the highest impact items to

1215
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:13,440
consider to maximize phenotypes in the

1216
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:13,440
new facility

1217
00:45:16,239 --> 00:45:20,719
highest impact items to maximize

1218
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:22,079
phenotypes in new facility well first

1219
00:45:20,719 --> 00:45:23,598
and foremost you have to have good

1220
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:26,400
genetics

1221
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:28,160
right you build this golden spaceship of

1222
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:30,240
a facility

1223
00:45:28,159 --> 00:45:31,519
but if you don't have good genetics to

1224
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:33,439
put into it

1225
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:35,039
then there's not much you can do in

1226
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:37,200
terms of maximizing phenotypic

1227
00:45:35,039 --> 00:45:39,920
expression if they're just

1228
00:45:37,199 --> 00:45:41,838
poor genetic samples to begin with

1229
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:43,680
other than that to me

1230
00:45:41,838 --> 00:45:45,519
it's about control

1231
00:45:43,679 --> 00:45:48,719
having control of all of those

1232
00:45:45,519 --> 00:45:50,719
parameters and not just some control but

1233
00:45:48,719 --> 00:45:52,559
as tight of a control as you possibly

1234
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:54,480
can

1235
00:45:52,559 --> 00:45:56,880
there's challenges with that from a

1236
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:58,880
business standpoint because the more

1237
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:00,800
control and automation and data

1238
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:02,559
collection you get the higher the

1239
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,680
capital expenditures are to start that

1240
00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:05,599
business

1241
00:46:03,679 --> 00:46:08,000
you also tend to then with see a higher

1242
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:10,160
capex a lower operating expenditures for

1243
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:12,559
that facility

1244
00:46:10,159 --> 00:46:14,719
but you know the control is going to

1245
00:46:12,559 --> 00:46:16,239
cost you something but you're going to

1246
00:46:14,719 --> 00:46:18,399
get that back

1247
00:46:16,239 --> 00:46:20,559
by with the maximization of these

1248
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:21,838
phenotypes and the increase in yield

1249
00:46:20,559 --> 00:46:23,920
that we see

1250
00:46:21,838 --> 00:46:26,000
so to me it's a trade-off that in the

1251
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:27,760
long run is really worth it

1252
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:30,800
you know investing in the right

1253
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:34,400
equipment to control all the parameters

1254
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:37,119
i mean the invite the hvac the co2

1255
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:38,000
supplementation uh your lighting type

1256
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:40,480
and

1257
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,559
and lighting layout your irrigation

1258
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:44,240
fertigation system

1259
00:46:42,559 --> 00:46:46,719
everything and then there's the

1260
00:46:44,239 --> 00:46:49,598
construction of the facility itself

1261
00:46:46,719 --> 00:46:51,279
making sure it's well sealed clean

1262
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:53,920
we're not bringing things in that are

1263
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:56,240
going to harm our crop

1264
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:58,480
all of those things go into maximizing

1265
00:46:56,239 --> 00:47:00,239
your phenotypic expression getting the

1266
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:02,000
most out of that crop

1267
00:47:00,239 --> 00:47:02,879
i i think you're right there's like you

1268
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:06,159
know

1269
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:08,240
everything is a balance of you know

1270
00:47:06,159 --> 00:47:09,679
cost and value and understanding what

1271
00:47:08,239 --> 00:47:11,838
the the end

1272
00:47:09,679 --> 00:47:14,960
goal is but i think one of the things

1273
00:47:11,838 --> 00:47:17,039
that gets overlooked so often is labor

1274
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:19,440
and sops and training

1275
00:47:17,039 --> 00:47:21,039
and oftentimes we think oh great i built

1276
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:22,318
this facility i have these great

1277
00:47:21,039 --> 00:47:23,679
genetics

1278
00:47:22,318 --> 00:47:26,000
well who's actually going to grow the

1279
00:47:23,679 --> 00:47:28,318
plants and how do you train them you

1280
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:31,039
know what is your ipm application

1281
00:47:28,318 --> 00:47:32,639
strategy and who's going to do it how

1282
00:47:31,039 --> 00:47:34,318
are they going to do it when are they

1283
00:47:32,639 --> 00:47:36,639
going to do it what's your cleaning

1284
00:47:34,318 --> 00:47:38,719
procedure with what

1285
00:47:36,639 --> 00:47:40,318
what's your trimming procedure you know

1286
00:47:38,719 --> 00:47:43,279
all these things have how many times

1287
00:47:40,318 --> 00:47:45,519
does it get touched in a whole cycle

1288
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:48,240
yeah all these things affect the end

1289
00:47:45,519 --> 00:47:50,400
consumer experience and uh i think it's

1290
00:47:48,239 --> 00:47:53,598
important to factor in labor and

1291
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:56,000
training and i think we see a lot of

1292
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:58,318
opportunities in the space to continue

1293
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:01,039
to refine the training of this industry

1294
00:47:58,318 --> 00:48:03,119
but i've also seen a ton of growth

1295
00:48:01,039 --> 00:48:05,759
and it's great to see

1296
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:08,400
people at a high level of academic

1297
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:09,599
research receiving phds and studying

1298
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:11,280
cannabis

1299
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:13,280
and i think that's you know just one

1300
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:15,280
step in the right direction of a great

1301
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:17,920
now we're getting the science let's get

1302
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:20,640
the labor let's get the application

1303
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:22,639
let's get the financial acumen up

1304
00:48:20,639 --> 00:48:24,960
and combine all these aspects so we can

1305
00:48:22,639 --> 00:48:26,639
truly make a decision on where to

1306
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:29,199
allocate these limited financial

1307
00:48:26,639 --> 00:48:31,598
resources to get the best reward at the

1308
00:48:29,199 --> 00:48:35,078
end or meet our goals at the end of this

1309
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:35,079
production facility

1310
00:48:35,679 --> 00:48:38,799
great

1311
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:38,800
great

1312
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:43,838
to think back a little bit um

1313
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,639
what's the best way to measure the

1314
00:48:43,838 --> 00:48:48,719
temperature the infrared for your camera

1315
00:48:46,639 --> 00:48:50,719
something else

1316
00:48:48,719 --> 00:48:52,159
best way to measure leaf temperature

1317
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:53,598
well

1318
00:48:52,159 --> 00:48:55,358
here

1319
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:58,079
you can definitely use infrared

1320
00:48:55,358 --> 00:49:00,400
thermometry like an ir gun

1321
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:02,079
but one thing to keep in mind is that if

1322
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:04,160
you go and buy one of these from home

1323
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:05,359
depot to measure the temperature of your

1324
00:49:04,159 --> 00:49:09,679
canopy

1325
00:49:05,358 --> 00:49:11,358
they're typically calibrated for drywall

1326
00:49:09,679 --> 00:49:13,838
to measure the temp of the drywall for

1327
00:49:11,358 --> 00:49:15,679
contractors so there's an adjustment

1328
00:49:13,838 --> 00:49:17,440
called emissivity

1329
00:49:15,679 --> 00:49:19,598
and you have to adjust the emissivity

1330
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:22,480
rating on these ir guns to be able to

1331
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:23,838
get an accurate temperature reading on a

1332
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:25,280
plant surface

1333
00:49:23,838 --> 00:49:27,279
i found

1334
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:30,400
from reading white papers and stuff that

1335
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:32,240
about 0.97 to 0.98

1336
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:34,079
is the right emissivity setting for

1337
00:49:32,239 --> 00:49:35,358
these ir guns to get an accurate

1338
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:37,519
temperature

1339
00:49:35,358 --> 00:49:39,199
however this is not an automated process

1340
00:49:37,519 --> 00:49:41,119
and you can't get real-time reading you

1341
00:49:39,199 --> 00:49:43,679
know it's a spot check

1342
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:45,599
fleur cameras or thermal imaging cameras

1343
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:47,679
are a great

1344
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:51,280
target for automating that process and

1345
00:49:47,679 --> 00:49:53,519
getting real-time vpd calculations

1346
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:57,040
but i think that there needs to be some

1347
00:49:53,519 --> 00:49:59,599
further r d to refine that technology

1348
00:49:57,039 --> 00:50:01,119
the angle of the camera plays a big role

1349
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:03,280
in getting accurate readings the

1350
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:05,519
distance from the canopy

1351
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:07,760
the height of the lights

1352
00:50:05,519 --> 00:50:09,039
and plus it's a lot more expensive than

1353
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:10,559
one of these

1354
00:50:09,039 --> 00:50:12,719
right and so you have to think about

1355
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:14,880
costs as well

1356
00:50:12,719 --> 00:50:16,639
what does it cost someone to go in and

1357
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:18,880
pay a labor to

1358
00:50:16,639 --> 00:50:20,400
go check your temp and record it versus

1359
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:22,559
a real time reading

1360
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:25,680
right so i think we get the cost of

1361
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:28,960
those flare cameras down and refine the

1362
00:50:25,679 --> 00:50:30,799
application of them on this these rooms

1363
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:32,480
would be a really good target

1364
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:34,559
i think another thing to think about too

1365
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:36,880
we talk about this all the time right is

1366
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:38,880
canopy cubic footage and which leaf are

1367
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:41,039
we measuring yeah how deep into the

1368
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:42,720
canopy do we go how do we come up with

1369
00:50:41,039 --> 00:50:43,599
an appropriate average

1370
00:50:42,719 --> 00:50:44,399
you know

1371
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:47,119
it's

1372
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:49,440
it becomes such a challenge um in really

1373
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:51,680
understanding real-time leaf temperature

1374
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:54,639
data relative to air flow and

1375
00:50:51,679 --> 00:50:56,859
homogenization of the space relative to

1376
00:50:54,639 --> 00:50:58,558
leaf temp offset to light um

1377
00:50:56,860 --> 00:51:00,559
[Music]

1378
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:01,760
so for me it's almost like it's a

1379
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:04,319
constant

1380
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:05,839
that needs to constantly be recalibrated

1381
00:51:04,318 --> 00:51:08,079
i mean like you mentioned the distance

1382
00:51:05,838 --> 00:51:09,838
from the light right so that means even

1383
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:12,000
if we have one lighting source and we

1384
00:51:09,838 --> 00:51:12,960
understand the offset at x amount of

1385
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,440
feet

1386
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:16,880
as those plants grow that offset becomes

1387
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:18,559
different

1388
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:21,039
and what is the real focus it's just

1389
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:23,280
another part of plant flow process and

1390
00:51:21,039 --> 00:51:25,440
cultivation techniques and canopy

1391
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:27,119
management to try and get that canopy as

1392
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:28,400
even as possible

1393
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:31,440
and understanding the depth of the

1394
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:32,960
canopy and the penetration of the light

1395
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:35,039
there's a lot of factors it's not as

1396
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:36,800
simple as just running or poke your head

1397
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:39,199
in the room and see the first leaf and

1398
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:40,640
shoot it and know the leaf temp offset

1399
00:51:39,199 --> 00:51:44,480
it's about trying to understand that

1400
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:44,480
room as a hole in the canopy as a whole

1401
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:50,400
and i saw someone throwing a link to an

1402
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:52,480
ir camera

1403
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:54,800
definitely an option as well i haven't

1404
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:56,400
investigated that as much but

1405
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:58,240
anyway that you know infrared

1406
00:51:56,400 --> 00:52:00,400
thermometry is very similar right this

1407
00:51:58,239 --> 00:52:01,838
is just a gun we can also use cameras to

1408
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:04,079
do it and that could be a great

1409
00:52:01,838 --> 00:52:07,920
technology as well to investigate for

1410
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:07,920
real-time vpd readings

1411
00:52:10,619 --> 00:52:15,679
[Music]

1412
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:15,680
quickly maybe you guys can touch on

1413
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:18,400
explaining

1414
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:20,960
how the different

1415
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:22,880
hvc conditions affect the crop and how

1416
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:25,119
tight control is required in terms of

1417
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:26,559
temp and humidity

1418
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:28,239
[Music]

1419
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:30,559
i think this is a pretty good one i mean

1420
00:52:28,239 --> 00:52:33,759
there's a several different angles here

1421
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:35,440
and my mind first goes to the accuracy

1422
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:37,119
of the sensors and the data that you

1423
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:38,480
actually collect

1424
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:40,240
so we have all these different

1425
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:41,119
parameters that we can control and

1426
00:52:40,239 --> 00:52:43,759
they're

1427
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:45,519
scientifically backed on the actions we

1428
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:47,280
take and what the final product should

1429
00:52:45,519 --> 00:52:49,920
see

1430
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:51,359
but it's so easy to just and we anders

1431
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:53,039
and i talk about this all the time

1432
00:52:51,358 --> 00:52:55,119
because we have such different

1433
00:52:53,039 --> 00:52:56,719
experiences in the cultivation space you

1434
00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:58,800
know the first thing i'm going to do

1435
00:52:56,719 --> 00:52:59,838
when i go into a space is read the

1436
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:01,359
plants

1437
00:52:59,838 --> 00:53:02,400
the first thing he's going to do is read

1438
00:53:01,358 --> 00:53:04,000
the data

1439
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,960
and then we're going to switch and we're

1440
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,559
going to make sure that there's a

1441
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:08,240
correlation there

1442
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:10,480
and that's some of the challenges that

1443
00:53:08,239 --> 00:53:13,519
we've seen in this industry is sensor

1444
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:15,920
drift and lack of recalibration

1445
00:53:13,519 --> 00:53:18,639
lack of accuracy of certain sensors

1446
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:20,559
sensors that are affected by ir in the

1447
00:53:18,639 --> 00:53:22,239
room or heat in the room or light in the

1448
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:24,960
room

1449
00:53:22,239 --> 00:53:27,199
so it's really fun to think about

1450
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:31,039
how you can apply

1451
00:53:27,199 --> 00:53:32,960
hvacd as a tool for crop steering

1452
00:53:31,039 --> 00:53:35,519
but without accurate data how do you

1453
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:36,400
create an accurate action plan

1454
00:53:35,519 --> 00:53:37,519
yeah

1455
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:39,599
no i

1456
00:53:37,519 --> 00:53:43,838
totally hear you on that and also the

1457
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:46,960
parameters and the control it it's um

1458
00:53:43,838 --> 00:53:49,519
it depends on

1459
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:51,599
what kind of lighting type you're using

1460
00:53:49,519 --> 00:53:53,358
you know it depends on what stage of

1461
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:55,440
growth you're in as well biggest

1462
00:53:53,358 --> 00:53:56,880
challenge is controlling environment in

1463
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:58,400
an indoor grow

1464
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:01,440
is uh

1465
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:03,760
the lights off to lights off transition

1466
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:05,838
right we have all that sensible

1467
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:08,559
you know heat and sensible load when the

1468
00:54:05,838 --> 00:54:11,358
lights are on when it goes off we get

1469
00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:12,880
this huge spike in relative humidity

1470
00:54:11,358 --> 00:54:14,480
and it's not

1471
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:16,400
high relative humidity that's going to

1472
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:18,000
give us mold it's going to be those big

1473
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:20,318
swings and relative humidity that's

1474
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:22,480
going to mold our crop and so having

1475
00:54:20,318 --> 00:54:25,920
equipment that can control that spike

1476
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:27,519
during that transition is a a great tool

1477
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:28,639
for ipm

1478
00:54:27,519 --> 00:54:30,400
and just to

1479
00:54:28,639 --> 00:54:32,480
make sure that this plant is seeing the

1480
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:34,480
right environment every minute of every

1481
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:36,639
day right that's the goal of an indoor

1482
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:39,119
grower is to basically provide it with

1483
00:54:36,639 --> 00:54:41,440
the perfect environment every minute of

1484
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:44,400
its entire lifetime is that always

1485
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:47,599
attainable definitely not right there's

1486
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:48,639
challenges in an indoor grow

1487
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:50,640
but

1488
00:54:48,639 --> 00:54:51,679
trying your best at doing that is really

1489
00:54:50,639 --> 00:54:53,199
our goal

1490
00:54:51,679 --> 00:54:55,679
you know and

1491
00:54:53,199 --> 00:54:56,639
so i think to unpack that you know from

1492
00:54:55,679 --> 00:54:59,519
a

1493
00:54:56,639 --> 00:55:02,558
digestible action plan creation to me

1494
00:54:59,519 --> 00:55:04,960
it's about 24-hour vpd control

1495
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:07,839
we so often talk about hey what's the

1496
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:10,159
right vpd when lights are on to

1497
00:55:07,838 --> 00:55:12,400
you know for biomass accumulation or

1498
00:55:10,159 --> 00:55:14,318
secondary metabolite creation

1499
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:16,160
but that lights off period is so

1500
00:55:14,318 --> 00:55:18,719
important like as you mentioned from an

1501
00:55:16,159 --> 00:55:20,719
ipm perspective but you know the two

1502
00:55:18,719 --> 00:55:22,639
main plant processes that we're talking

1503
00:55:20,719 --> 00:55:25,439
about here transpiration and the lights

1504
00:55:22,639 --> 00:55:26,400
are on and respiration lights are off

1505
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:28,400
and

1506
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:30,720
how do those factors of root zone

1507
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:34,160
temperature affect the ability of that

1508
00:55:30,719 --> 00:55:35,199
plant to take up oxygen in the root zone

1509
00:55:34,159 --> 00:55:37,440
um

1510
00:55:35,199 --> 00:55:40,000
it's just uh there's a lot going on but

1511
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:41,679
thinking about it from a 24-hour period

1512
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,039
rather than just what can i do when my

1513
00:55:41,679 --> 00:55:44,879
lights are on

1514
00:55:43,039 --> 00:55:46,960
let's think about how that plant repairs

1515
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:49,920
itself and the lights are off

1516
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:51,920
which prepares us to jump back into a

1517
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:53,760
high ppfd environment as soon as the

1518
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:55,358
lights come on

1519
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:58,799
i mean that's a great debate about

1520
00:55:55,358 --> 00:56:00,880
sunrises and sunsets and light intensity

1521
00:55:58,798 --> 00:56:03,199
but i think the more that you can allow

1522
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:05,280
that plant to see the appropriate

1523
00:56:03,199 --> 00:56:06,960
conditions when the lights are off the

1524
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:09,599
better she'll perform when the lights

1525
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:11,440
are on i usually say a healthy day

1526
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:14,240
requires a healthy night

1527
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:16,159
and if you really want to perform

1528
00:56:14,239 --> 00:56:17,919
and get as much out of that lighting

1529
00:56:16,159 --> 00:56:19,598
period as you can

1530
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:21,519
you need to let her sleep a little bit

1531
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:23,359
and what i mean by that is just

1532
00:56:21,519 --> 00:56:26,159
effectively take uh take care of the

1533
00:56:23,358 --> 00:56:28,880
respiration process as well exactly

1534
00:56:26,159 --> 00:56:31,358
yeah and i mean again it's we control

1535
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:33,440
ambient in these rooms the temperature

1536
00:56:31,358 --> 00:56:35,920
and relative humidities to really

1537
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:38,240
control leaf temperature that's what we

1538
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:40,000
really care about right we want to make

1539
00:56:38,239 --> 00:56:42,558
sure that leaf temperature is in the

1540
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:44,639
proper zone for photosynthetic rate

1541
00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:46,880
metabolic rate

1542
00:56:44,639 --> 00:56:49,440
you know maximum co2 assimilation which

1543
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:52,160
is going to pack on yield and biomass

1544
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:52,159
all those things

1545
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:56,079
got it

1546
00:56:54,079 --> 00:57:00,880
great answers guys

1547
00:56:56,079 --> 00:57:03,359
another one on coas um what do you guys

1548
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:06,318
see is the range of terpene percentage

1549
00:57:03,358 --> 00:57:06,318
that is attainable

1550
00:57:06,798 --> 00:57:10,559
i don't know if we know the upper limit

1551
00:57:08,639 --> 00:57:13,118
yet

1552
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:16,000
what's the highest result you've seen

1553
00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:17,358
i think it was like four or something

1554
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:20,318
i don't know have you seen anything

1555
00:57:17,358 --> 00:57:21,598
higher like you just need five percents

1556
00:57:20,318 --> 00:57:23,679
i've seen

1557
00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:25,039
a significant amount of fours especially

1558
00:57:23,679 --> 00:57:27,118
recently

1559
00:57:25,039 --> 00:57:30,079
i've talked to breeders that have their

1560
00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:32,400
hands in the dirt and uh it reminds me

1561
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:34,160
of you know just good storytelling where

1562
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:36,079
people said that they've cracked eight

1563
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:38,798
or even cracked ten

1564
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:40,640
and those numbers to me seem absurd yeah

1565
00:57:38,798 --> 00:57:43,358
they seem absurd i've never seen them on

1566
00:57:40,639 --> 00:57:46,960
paper but i do know that there are

1567
00:57:43,358 --> 00:57:48,639
breeders that prize terps and

1568
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:50,639
they are driving

1569
00:57:48,639 --> 00:57:53,519
every aspect of their breeding and

1570
00:57:50,639 --> 00:57:54,558
selection whether it's male selection

1571
00:57:53,519 --> 00:57:56,559
for

1572
00:57:54,559 --> 00:57:58,880
you know to be a carrier male or to be

1573
00:57:56,559 --> 00:58:02,000
an influencer male

1574
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:05,200
in trying to get more out of that female

1575
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:06,719
from a terp perspective

1576
00:58:05,199 --> 00:58:08,318
i think you know we're going to continue

1577
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:09,759
to see those numbers grow but like you

1578
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:12,798
said i'm not exactly sure what that

1579
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:15,119
upper echelon is

1580
00:58:12,798 --> 00:58:17,039
on paper yeah i mean probably close to

1581
00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:18,960
five is the highest i've seen 4.8 or

1582
00:58:17,039 --> 00:58:21,199
something like that

1583
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:24,000
yeah and i mean again it's

1584
00:58:21,199 --> 00:58:25,838
you can only achieve that kind of number

1585
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,880
if you have good environmental control

1586
00:58:25,838 --> 00:58:28,480
throughout

1587
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:29,920
your flowering cycle but then also

1588
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:32,159
drying and curing i was just going to

1589
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:34,159
say that right because it's preserving

1590
00:58:32,159 --> 00:58:36,798
terpenes to me is the same kind of

1591
00:58:34,159 --> 00:58:39,759
mindset i used when making concentrates

1592
00:58:36,798 --> 00:58:41,838
or like a wine maker does right

1593
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:43,760
the grower grows the grapes or grows the

1594
00:58:41,838 --> 00:58:46,239
cannabis and as a

1595
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:49,040
as a concentrated manufacturer you don't

1596
00:58:46,239 --> 00:58:51,118
make anything you just try and preserve

1597
00:58:49,039 --> 00:58:53,119
it and keep that quality there that

1598
00:58:51,119 --> 00:58:54,240
quality that resident and showcase it in

1599
00:58:53,119 --> 00:58:55,760
its best

1600
00:58:54,239 --> 00:58:56,479
possible manner

1601
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:58,960
right

1602
00:58:56,480 --> 00:59:00,079
it's the same thing with terps on flower

1603
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:02,880
you can

1604
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:04,240
grow this your room can be just so loud

1605
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:06,000
you know what i'm talking about you open

1606
00:59:04,239 --> 00:59:07,358
up that room to your flower that door to

1607
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:09,358
your flower room and you just get hit in

1608
00:59:07,358 --> 00:59:11,119
the face like oh

1609
00:59:09,358 --> 00:59:12,239
that's a good room you know

1610
00:59:11,119 --> 00:59:15,200
gas cake

1611
00:59:12,239 --> 00:59:16,159
gas cake number three it's loud you know

1612
00:59:15,199 --> 00:59:17,598
but

1613
00:59:16,159 --> 00:59:19,358
if something goes wrong you're drying

1614
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:21,359
and curing or even in your

1615
00:59:19,358 --> 00:59:23,358
post-processing and storage how you

1616
00:59:21,358 --> 00:59:25,759
handle it in transport through

1617
00:59:23,358 --> 00:59:27,039
distribution and then to the dispensary

1618
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:29,440
shelf

1619
00:59:27,039 --> 00:59:31,440
that four percent might have existed

1620
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:33,599
when it was sent to the lab

1621
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:35,039
but i would wager that it's not that

1622
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:36,240
level by the time it gets to the

1623
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:38,558
consumer

1624
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:40,078
right and so i take them with a grain of

1625
00:59:38,559 --> 00:59:41,839
salt

1626
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:44,559
but you know the value of terpenes is

1627
00:59:41,838 --> 00:59:46,639
high there's definitely a room for

1628
00:59:44,559 --> 00:59:49,599
breeding for higher percentages i mean

1629
00:59:46,639 --> 00:59:52,239
think about a few decades ago

1630
00:59:49,599 --> 00:59:54,640
cannabinoids were back in the 70s were

1631
00:59:52,239 --> 00:59:56,479
only eight to 12 percent right

1632
00:59:54,639 --> 00:59:59,358
cultivars would be eight twelve percent

1633
00:59:56,480 --> 01:00:01,519
thc now we're seeing stuff

1634
00:59:59,358 --> 01:00:03,119
35 40

1635
01:00:01,519 --> 01:00:04,960
and yeah we can argue about moisture

1636
01:00:03,119 --> 01:00:07,440
content and how that affects that

1637
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:09,358
overall potency but still

1638
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:11,599
it's crazy how far

1639
01:00:09,358 --> 01:00:12,880
we've come in terms of the potency of

1640
01:00:11,599 --> 01:00:15,200
this plant

1641
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:18,480
it's kind of insane and now that the

1642
01:00:15,199 --> 01:00:20,558
last you know five six so years or so a

1643
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:22,480
huge focus has been put on terps and

1644
01:00:20,559 --> 01:00:24,798
terpenes it's uh

1645
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:27,440
i'm sure we will see those numbers grow

1646
01:00:24,798 --> 01:00:30,079
over time as well who knows what one

1647
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:31,838
gram can actually hold and bud like it's

1648
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:33,680
insane to think about

1649
01:00:31,838 --> 01:00:36,159
it's funny too i remember the first time

1650
01:00:33,679 --> 01:00:37,679
i cracked 30 percent i was so proud now

1651
01:00:36,159 --> 01:00:38,879
i'm like embarrassed of those test

1652
01:00:37,679 --> 01:00:40,558
results considering where the

1653
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:42,480
community's at it's like

1654
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:44,160
yeah man i crack 30 now i'm just like

1655
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:45,838
you know you need to be shooting higher

1656
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:48,000
than that considering the genetics and

1657
01:00:45,838 --> 01:00:51,838
the level of control we have yeah show

1658
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:55,358
me a test result at 40 thc with like

1659
01:00:51,838 --> 01:00:57,519
12 13 14 moisture content that's really

1660
01:00:55,358 --> 01:00:59,199
impressive that's what i just showed i

1661
01:00:57,519 --> 01:01:01,519
know the reasons i shared it and i think

1662
01:00:59,199 --> 01:01:03,199
the gamesmanship of that water content

1663
01:01:01,519 --> 01:01:05,280
is really important here

1664
01:01:03,199 --> 01:01:07,358
reading those coas and understanding

1665
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:09,839
what they really say like you do need to

1666
01:01:07,358 --> 01:01:11,679
know the moisture content because you

1667
01:01:09,838 --> 01:01:15,039
know four percent

1668
01:01:11,679 --> 01:01:16,719
moisture content and 44 to me is not

1669
01:01:15,039 --> 01:01:18,719
nearly as exciting

1670
01:01:16,719 --> 01:01:20,399
i know what the bud is going to burn

1671
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:22,719
like i know that it's going to be dry

1672
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:25,200
and crumbly and the same goes for terps

1673
01:01:22,719 --> 01:01:27,039
right it's a relational percentage and

1674
01:01:25,199 --> 01:01:29,838
proportion so

1675
01:01:27,039 --> 01:01:32,400
there's this gamesmanship of how low do

1676
01:01:29,838 --> 01:01:35,279
we let that moisture content number get

1677
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:37,039
in order to get high coas but still keep

1678
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:38,640
it high enough that we get customer

1679
01:01:37,039 --> 01:01:41,920
satisfaction

1680
01:01:38,639 --> 01:01:45,358
a shelf life um yeah and just a product

1681
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:45,358
that people really want and enjoy

1682
01:01:45,519 --> 01:01:49,838
you know i saw another um question here

1683
01:01:48,318 --> 01:01:50,838
in the chat that i'd like to speak to

1684
01:01:49,838 --> 01:01:53,358
real

1685
01:01:50,838 --> 01:01:55,519
quickly essentially it says what what

1686
01:01:53,358 --> 01:01:57,119
are the best yields that phenotypes can

1687
01:01:55,519 --> 01:01:58,880
achieve and

1688
01:01:57,119 --> 01:02:01,440
christian heroes speaking in grams per

1689
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:03,440
meter squared unfortunately i'm here in

1690
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:06,880
california and i speak in grams per

1691
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:08,880
square foot of canopy um so i don't off

1692
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:10,240
the top of my head no the correlation to

1693
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:12,559
meters squared

1694
01:02:10,239 --> 01:02:15,199
adrian adrian kindly did the conversion

1695
01:02:12,559 --> 01:02:18,640
here and it looks like uh

1696
01:02:15,199 --> 01:02:19,679
it's between 74 and 84 grams per square

1697
01:02:18,639 --> 01:02:22,400
foot

1698
01:02:19,679 --> 01:02:24,399
well that's what he put 800 to 900 yeah

1699
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:26,960
that's the translation of this standard

1700
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:29,039
measurement yeah i mean if so this is

1701
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:32,079
the way i think about it right like if i

1702
01:02:29,039 --> 01:02:34,720
was doing a pro forma to do a financial

1703
01:02:32,079 --> 01:02:37,200
plan for my cannabis business i would

1704
01:02:34,719 --> 01:02:41,279
probably benchmark it at 55 grams a

1705
01:02:37,199 --> 01:02:43,358
square foot which is attainable and not

1706
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:46,400
everyone can attain it but it's a good

1707
01:02:43,358 --> 01:02:48,400
target to benchmark your business off of

1708
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:50,480
now if you're getting closer to

1709
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:53,838
20 grams per square foot

1710
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:55,599
to you know 25 grams per square foot

1711
01:02:53,838 --> 01:02:58,239
you might need to up that a little bit

1712
01:02:55,599 --> 01:03:00,640
to survive in this industry

1713
01:02:58,239 --> 01:03:02,959
but if you're up at the 80 to 100 grams

1714
01:03:00,639 --> 01:03:04,558
per square foot you're killing

1715
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:06,559
it's low balance especially if you have

1716
01:03:04,559 --> 01:03:07,440
the quality too because it's one thing

1717
01:03:06,559 --> 01:03:10,319
to have

1718
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:13,358
yield but it's also about quality

1719
01:03:10,318 --> 01:03:14,838
and i'm talking sellable flower weight

1720
01:03:13,358 --> 01:03:17,920
not trim

1721
01:03:14,838 --> 01:03:20,558
plus everything i'm talking 80 to 100

1722
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:22,480
grams of sellable flour weight

1723
01:03:20,559 --> 01:03:24,720
that's pretty impressive i don't think

1724
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:27,679
i've ever seen anything too much over

1725
01:03:24,719 --> 01:03:29,598
100 grams per square foot of like actual

1726
01:03:27,679 --> 01:03:31,679
sellable flour and even that probably

1727
01:03:29,599 --> 01:03:34,079
had a little bit of some smalls and

1728
01:03:31,679 --> 01:03:35,759
b-grade flour included in it too but

1729
01:03:34,079 --> 01:03:37,200
it's how you calculate it

1730
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:38,880
and that's the importance of like

1731
01:03:37,199 --> 01:03:40,879
understanding what the baseline for

1732
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:43,200
measurement is right we talk about this

1733
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:45,358
a lot too with people throwing around i

1734
01:03:43,199 --> 01:03:47,199
got a 100 grams a square foot and then

1735
01:03:45,358 --> 01:03:49,679
you realize they were measuring fan

1736
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:51,598
leaves and stuff exactly all this other

1737
01:03:49,679 --> 01:03:53,038
stuff that like come on man that's not

1738
01:03:51,599 --> 01:03:55,039
going to go to market you can't count

1739
01:03:53,039 --> 01:03:57,119
that in the calculations so

1740
01:03:55,039 --> 01:04:00,240
really understanding what in what went

1741
01:03:57,119 --> 01:04:02,559
into that and do you derate your smaller

1742
01:04:00,239 --> 01:04:04,558
buds you know things like that they're

1743
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:06,400
big factors in trying to get everyone on

1744
01:04:04,559 --> 01:04:08,480
the same page for communicating what a

1745
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:10,798
good baseline would be

1746
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:12,559
or what a high level you know who's

1747
01:04:10,798 --> 01:04:14,960
going to win that game is the person

1748
01:04:12,559 --> 01:04:17,440
that really understands

1749
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:19,838
what is actually going to market how to

1750
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:22,559
measure it and putting together

1751
01:04:19,838 --> 01:04:25,440
historical crop steering techniques per

1752
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:26,400
cultivar that allow you to achieve it

1753
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:28,559
totally

1754
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:29,920
i mean this even kind of reminds me of

1755
01:04:28,559 --> 01:04:31,599
the discussion we had the other day

1756
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:33,680
around um

1757
01:04:31,599 --> 01:04:35,519
you know accounting practices in

1758
01:04:33,679 --> 01:04:37,038
cannabis 2 and how there's just so many

1759
01:04:35,519 --> 01:04:39,038
different ways to report this

1760
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:41,280
information in a financial statement as

1761
01:04:39,039 --> 01:04:44,079
well it's like the same thing when we're

1762
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:45,920
talking about how to report our yield in

1763
01:04:44,079 --> 01:04:47,920
grams per square foot

1764
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:49,358
you know there's a

1765
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:51,200
a lot of non

1766
01:04:49,358 --> 01:04:52,880
uh you know generally accepted

1767
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:54,798
accounting principles that are applied

1768
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:57,200
to cannabis financial statements as well

1769
01:04:54,798 --> 01:05:00,960
too it's kind of we still have a lot of

1770
01:04:57,199 --> 01:05:00,960
things to figure out that's a good point

1771
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:08,000
well should we uh i'm thinking maybe we

1772
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:11,599
cap off this uh conversation with uh

1773
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:15,838
question regarding growing media

1774
01:05:11,599 --> 01:05:15,838
jesse let you scratch your micro bitch

1775
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:23,119
don't get him started oh man that's why

1776
01:05:20,559 --> 01:05:24,480
we're doing it at the end here okay good

1777
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:26,720
good call

1778
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:29,199
all right so uh high level thoughts on

1779
01:05:26,719 --> 01:05:30,959
hydroponic versus soil grow growth media

1780
01:05:29,199 --> 01:05:32,318
methods um

1781
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:34,079
in terms of the highest quality of

1782
01:05:32,318 --> 01:05:36,400
product or both methods capable of

1783
01:05:34,079 --> 01:05:37,599
reaching same or similar high quality

1784
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:40,240
end results

1785
01:05:37,599 --> 01:05:42,000
um just wondering if using hydroponic

1786
01:05:40,239 --> 01:05:44,399
growth methods limits a certain

1787
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:45,920
phenotypic uh phenotype expression in

1788
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:48,160
some cultivars

1789
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:49,599
um if you're

1790
01:05:48,159 --> 01:05:53,519
asking the plants to perform an

1791
01:05:49,599 --> 01:05:53,519
environment that is unnatural

1792
01:05:54,400 --> 01:06:00,559
limiting the phenotypic expression of

1793
01:05:56,318 --> 01:06:00,558
your plants by growing hydroponically

1794
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:05,440
that's you know that's a

1795
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:06,960
super loaded question that we can unpack

1796
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:08,798
15 different ways

1797
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:10,480
and the way

1798
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:11,679
i think anders and i talk about it

1799
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:13,119
because

1800
01:06:11,679 --> 01:06:15,358
i think as

1801
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:18,318
most people that know me know like i

1802
01:06:15,358 --> 01:06:20,159
love soil i love microbiology i love

1803
01:06:18,318 --> 01:06:22,880
thinking about inoculating fungal

1804
01:06:20,159 --> 01:06:25,038
colonies and nutrient cycling and the

1805
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:26,880
accumulation of molecules in the plant

1806
01:06:25,039 --> 01:06:29,680
as a byproduct

1807
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:31,920
microbes as pest defense microbes for

1808
01:06:29,679 --> 01:06:34,480
systemic acquired response all these

1809
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:36,000
angles that microbes bring to the party

1810
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:38,639
doesn't necessarily mean they can't be

1811
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:41,159
included in hydroponic production

1812
01:06:38,639 --> 01:06:44,239
i think the part of

1813
01:06:41,159 --> 01:06:46,558
differentiating hydroponics and let's

1814
01:06:44,239 --> 01:06:48,078
call it a soil based approach

1815
01:06:46,559 --> 01:06:50,400
is the level of control and

1816
01:06:48,079 --> 01:06:52,640
understanding you get it's very

1817
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:55,280
challenging to understand let's say you

1818
01:06:52,639 --> 01:06:56,719
do a you know a soil test or something

1819
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:57,760
like that to understand what's in the

1820
01:06:56,719 --> 01:06:59,439
media

1821
01:06:57,760 --> 01:07:01,920
that doesn't necessarily give you all

1822
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:03,760
the tools you need to truly crop steer

1823
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:05,680
from a fertigation and control

1824
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:07,520
perspective it's about response time

1825
01:07:05,679 --> 01:07:09,919
when you're making that decision

1826
01:07:07,519 --> 01:07:11,440
so in a hydroponic or quote-unquote

1827
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:13,280
sterile media

1828
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:16,159
you have the opportunity to control

1829
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:18,319
those variables with much more precision

1830
01:07:16,159 --> 01:07:20,879
i think that that creates an opportunity

1831
01:07:18,318 --> 01:07:23,838
for you to potentially make mistakes

1832
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:25,358
um and considering we don't have

1833
01:07:23,838 --> 01:07:27,759
you know we're still they're still

1834
01:07:25,358 --> 01:07:30,558
emerging data it's hard for me to say

1835
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:32,000
i'm 100 in the camp of nutrient salts

1836
01:07:30,559 --> 01:07:34,240
and rock wool

1837
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:36,480
but at the same time i respect the fact

1838
01:07:34,239 --> 01:07:39,118
that there's control measurable

1839
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:41,358
applications that we can predict action

1840
01:07:39,119 --> 01:07:43,920
plans off of

1841
01:07:41,358 --> 01:07:46,000
the management of soil and soil

1842
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:48,480
recycling and recycling media can be

1843
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:49,519
incredibly challenging um

1844
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:51,679
and

1845
01:07:49,519 --> 01:07:53,519
when we have a hydroponic media it's so

1846
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:54,960
much easier to say all right we're done

1847
01:07:53,519 --> 01:07:56,880
with this run

1848
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:59,199
now we're starting from scratch again

1849
01:07:56,880 --> 01:08:00,318
and you have a blank slate to write your

1850
01:07:59,199 --> 01:08:03,038
poem

1851
01:08:00,318 --> 01:08:04,558
and get this plant to market

1852
01:08:03,039 --> 01:08:06,400
but i don't think that that necessarily

1853
01:08:04,559 --> 01:08:08,400
means you have to exclude microbes which

1854
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:10,160
is a whole other conversation

1855
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:12,798
i just think from a crop steering and

1856
01:08:10,159 --> 01:08:16,238
application standpoint

1857
01:08:12,798 --> 01:08:19,198
soil is more of like a very wide or very

1858
01:08:16,238 --> 01:08:20,238
long tarmac for you to be successful on

1859
01:08:19,198 --> 01:08:22,719
without

1860
01:08:20,238 --> 01:08:26,238
precision measurable control

1861
01:08:22,719 --> 01:08:29,198
whereas a hydroponic approach is

1862
01:08:26,238 --> 01:08:31,039
shorter tarmac but very measurable

1863
01:08:29,198 --> 01:08:33,358
so if something goes also about

1864
01:08:31,039 --> 01:08:35,359
buffering in terms of risk right i mean

1865
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:37,279
your plant is going to be somewhat safer

1866
01:08:35,359 --> 01:08:38,880
in soil to an extent

1867
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:40,960
if something was to go wrong in an

1868
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:42,798
indoor facility it provides more of a

1869
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:43,838
buffer to the plant

1870
01:08:42,798 --> 01:08:45,600
um

1871
01:08:43,838 --> 01:08:47,838
but the downside is then the

1872
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:50,798
responsiveness in eliciting certain crop

1873
01:08:47,838 --> 01:08:53,439
steering techniques you know vice versa

1874
01:08:50,798 --> 01:08:55,198
if you if you forget to water rock wool

1875
01:08:53,439 --> 01:08:57,919
for a day that plant's not going to live

1876
01:08:55,198 --> 01:09:00,559
very long right or your ph sensors off

1877
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:02,880
yep you're going to get slammed with

1878
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:04,960
acid or alkaline and that can have a

1879
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:07,199
dramatic effect just in

1880
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:10,319
four applications totally no

1881
01:09:07,198 --> 01:09:12,399
i mean i i myself am more of a salt rock

1882
01:09:10,319 --> 01:09:15,039
wool type grower you know into like

1883
01:09:12,399 --> 01:09:17,278
precision agriculture but i definitely

1884
01:09:15,039 --> 01:09:19,039
respect the soil guys out there it's a

1885
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:21,359
challenge it's tough

1886
01:09:19,039 --> 01:09:24,158
to me it's hard to

1887
01:09:21,359 --> 01:09:26,079
duplicate and make consistent run to run

1888
01:09:24,158 --> 01:09:27,039
even though it is possible

1889
01:09:26,079 --> 01:09:30,158
um

1890
01:09:27,039 --> 01:09:32,319
there's a lot of benefits of soil

1891
01:09:30,158 --> 01:09:34,079
and i've seen some wonderfully grown

1892
01:09:32,319 --> 01:09:36,560
living soil cannabis some of the best

1893
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:38,798
flour i've ever consumed has come from

1894
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:40,159
living soil grown you know you know

1895
01:09:38,798 --> 01:09:42,880
media

1896
01:09:40,158 --> 01:09:45,358
but from a reproducibility efficiency

1897
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:47,759
cleanliness standpoint it's hard to beat

1898
01:09:45,359 --> 01:09:50,400
you know hydroponics with

1899
01:09:47,759 --> 01:09:51,198
more of a sterile media um

1900
01:09:50,399 --> 01:09:52,639
you know

1901
01:09:51,198 --> 01:09:54,079
it's a give and take it's really a

1902
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:56,320
preference thing

1903
01:09:54,079 --> 01:09:58,719
and it's about

1904
01:09:56,319 --> 01:10:01,039
you know and it's a science thing and we

1905
01:09:58,719 --> 01:10:02,560
need more scientific research to truly

1906
01:10:01,039 --> 01:10:06,000
understand what's going on in these

1907
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:10,080
organic soil based medias to apply it

1908
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:12,800
and you know my hope is that we get more

1909
01:10:10,079 --> 01:10:14,640
soil guys embracing some of the

1910
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:16,560
fertigation crop steering techniques and

1911
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:18,560
we get more of these sterile salt based

1912
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:20,880
guys embracing the organic techniques

1913
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:22,480
bringing amino acids and hormones and

1914
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:24,159
these other factors into the party

1915
01:10:22,479 --> 01:10:25,039
rather than just thinking hey what are

1916
01:10:24,158 --> 01:10:27,119
the

1917
01:10:25,039 --> 01:10:29,600
you know

1918
01:10:27,119 --> 01:10:32,000
19 nutrients that i need to deliver to

1919
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:33,840
this plant and instead think how are

1920
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:36,238
these nutrients being available how are

1921
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:38,079
they chelated at what levels what are

1922
01:10:36,238 --> 01:10:40,158
the relationships between them and we

1923
01:10:38,079 --> 01:10:42,158
have some of that data

1924
01:10:40,158 --> 01:10:44,000
but i think you know

1925
01:10:42,158 --> 01:10:45,759
it's definitely a marriage of knowledge

1926
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:47,520
it's not two camps that need to fight

1927
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:48,960
each other it's two camps that need to

1928
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:50,800
respect each other

1929
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:52,880
um and i get the people that are in the

1930
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:54,640
organic camp that say hey i'd ever want

1931
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:56,880
to use salts because they're synthetic

1932
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:58,480
and fights go fight you know

1933
01:10:56,880 --> 01:11:00,880
some of these

1934
01:10:58,479 --> 01:11:03,198
chemicals end up in the soil leaching

1935
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:05,279
into our world and they're not healthy

1936
01:11:03,198 --> 01:11:07,839
for us but i think that's why it's so

1937
01:11:05,279 --> 01:11:10,319
important to fine-tune the control

1938
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:12,319
and how much fertigation how much runoff

1939
01:11:10,319 --> 01:11:14,559
and really being able to minimize the

1940
01:11:12,319 --> 01:11:16,559
negative environmental effects of using

1941
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:18,239
synthetics

1942
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:20,480
but again embracing some of these

1943
01:11:18,238 --> 01:11:22,000
organic understandings

1944
01:11:20,479 --> 01:11:24,079
i think that's the marriage where you

1945
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:26,479
don't lose anything at all it's nothing

1946
01:11:24,079 --> 01:11:28,640
to gain you get the precision control

1947
01:11:26,479 --> 01:11:30,479
you get great phenotypic expression

1948
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:31,920
you're maximizing and optimizing that

1949
01:11:30,479 --> 01:11:33,519
plan

1950
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:35,760
i mean there has to be some middle

1951
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:38,719
ground a hybrid approach to fully

1952
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:40,719
sterile and utilizing organics you know

1953
01:11:38,719 --> 01:11:43,600
whether that is using some beneficial

1954
01:11:40,719 --> 01:11:45,760
insects in your flowering room or

1955
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:48,320
using mycorrhizae fungi during the

1956
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:50,400
transplant even if in rock wool like

1957
01:11:48,319 --> 01:11:52,639
there's still benefits you can get from

1958
01:11:50,399 --> 01:11:54,960
organics

1959
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:56,560
in a sterile hydroponic media but

1960
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:58,000
there's you know there could be a really

1961
01:11:56,560 --> 01:12:00,000
good middle ground between the two that

1962
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:01,439
we just haven't dialed in yet as

1963
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:04,880
cultivators

1964
01:12:01,439 --> 01:12:04,879
and this could be our next webinar

1965
01:12:06,238 --> 01:12:11,678
i like it i like it well hey guys it's

1966
01:12:09,119 --> 01:12:14,000
uh we're 15 minutes past the hour um i

1967
01:12:11,679 --> 01:12:15,359
think uh why don't we put a pin in it

1968
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,880
for now

1969
01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:19,039
and um

1970
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:20,640
to our audience thanks everybody for

1971
01:12:19,039 --> 01:12:22,158
sticking around

1972
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:24,000
thanks everybody really appreciate the

1973
01:12:22,158 --> 01:12:25,839
opportunity to talk about these things

1974
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:27,439
that we love so much so thanks for

1975
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:29,360
coming and uh we look forward to doing

1976
01:12:27,439 --> 01:12:31,039
another one for everybody yes sir

1977
01:12:29,359 --> 01:12:34,559
appreciate y'all for showing up thank

1978
01:12:31,039 --> 01:12:34,560
you next time
