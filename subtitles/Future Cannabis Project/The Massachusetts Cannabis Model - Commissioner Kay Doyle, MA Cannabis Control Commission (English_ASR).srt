2
00:00:07,129 --> 00:00:13,530
quick quick quick historical overview

3
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:16,399
Massachusetts has had a medical use of

4
00:00:13,529 --> 00:00:23,490
marijuana program since approximately

5
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:25,409
really up and running say 2013 both the

6
00:00:23,489 --> 00:00:28,189
medical program and the adult program

7
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:31,289
were put in place by ballot initiative

8
00:00:28,189 --> 00:00:32,429
for any of you that reside in the state

9
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:34,410
or do business in the state where a

10
00:00:32,429 --> 00:00:37,679
ballot initiative is the process by

11
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:40,409
which regulation of cannabis may be

12
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:42,119
coming to pass please please please do

13
00:00:40,409 --> 00:00:45,509
your best to advocate for reasonable

14
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:47,159
timelines because in both the medical

15
00:00:45,509 --> 00:00:50,070
and the adult use cannabis

16
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:51,988
implementation in Massachusetts the

17
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:54,030
legislators and the regulator's were

18
00:00:51,988 --> 00:00:57,030
given a very very short period of time

19
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:59,399
to work with and as you very thoughtful

20
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:02,969
people know that is not the best way to

21
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:06,329
develop good policy so here's a quick

22
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:08,969
timeline for the adult process there was

23
00:01:06,329 --> 00:01:13,530
a ballot initiative in November of 2016

24
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:14,819
the legislature had to amend the law

25
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:16,799
that was put in place by the ballot

26
00:01:14,819 --> 00:01:18,389
petition because there were certain

27
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,610
areas that were in conflict with the law

28
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:22,530
and while they were in there they did

29
00:01:20,609 --> 00:01:24,390
some other things and one of those other

30
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:26,939
things was they created the energy and

31
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:29,239
environmental work group which Alex sat

32
00:01:26,938 --> 00:01:31,078
on together with me and some

33
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:32,429
representatives from the Department of

34
00:01:31,078 --> 00:01:33,889
Environmental Protection and the

35
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:37,590
Department of Agriculture in

36
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:39,719
Massachusetts and as we go forward

37
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:41,490
through this timeline you'll see that

38
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:44,129
the energy and environmental workgroup

39
00:01:41,489 --> 00:01:46,530
was working to try and get energy and

40
00:01:44,129 --> 00:01:48,298
efficiency standards into place as we

41
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:50,670
were simultaneously building an

42
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:52,439
independent agent see we don't sit in

43
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:54,629
any other part of the Massachusetts

44
00:01:52,438 --> 00:01:56,250
government we're a little balloon off to

45
00:01:54,629 --> 00:02:01,069
the side so we had no existing

46
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:03,780
infrastructure and also licensing to get

47
00:02:01,069 --> 00:02:05,519
licensees up and running and one of the

48
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:08,429
things I'm sure those of you who work in

49
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:11,400
the cannabis environment know is nothing

50
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:13,709
related to this industry seems to go to

51
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,959
plan something always

52
00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:18,769
sideways a little bit and one of the

53
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:21,120
examples of that is one of our first two

54
00:02:18,769 --> 00:02:24,930
licensees to open and commence

55
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,849
operations November 20th 2018 there is

56
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:29,909
often a variable no matter how much you

57
00:02:26,848 --> 00:02:32,669
plan for something that throws off the

58
00:02:29,908 --> 00:02:35,280
result you're expecting and in this case

59
00:02:32,669 --> 00:02:38,039
it was that we had a lovely central

60
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,109
location for one of our licensees and a

61
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:43,858
town called Leicester that was very

62
00:02:40,109 --> 00:02:45,689
excited to have them open up and we have

63
00:02:43,859 --> 00:02:48,540
done very careful study of their traffic

64
00:02:45,688 --> 00:02:51,209
plan and we're excited to have them be

65
00:02:48,539 --> 00:02:54,418
one of our first licensees so the week

66
00:02:51,209 --> 00:02:57,628
of Thanksgiving in November 2018 we

67
00:02:54,419 --> 00:02:59,730
allowed them to go forward not realizing

68
00:02:57,628 --> 00:03:03,449
that the access road they were on was

69
00:02:59,729 --> 00:03:07,310
the only Road to the local Walmart Black

70
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:09,899
Friday can you imagine the first

71
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:13,650
licensee opening on the eastern seaboard

72
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:17,069
was also located on the only road to the

73
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:20,039
local Walmart on Black Friday so if you

74
00:03:17,068 --> 00:03:23,728
saw the news coverage of that you can

75
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:25,888
imagine how that went here's a quick

76
00:03:23,729 --> 00:03:29,729
overview as to type of licenses that we

77
00:03:25,889 --> 00:03:32,069
have in Massachusetts so most of these

78
00:03:29,729 --> 00:03:33,870
are exactly what they sound like you

79
00:03:32,068 --> 00:03:35,698
know cultivation that's exactly what you

80
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:38,519
would think Kraft cooperatives is a

81
00:03:35,699 --> 00:03:40,709
cooperative structure for cultivation

82
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:43,500
micro businesses are limited in size and

83
00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:45,479
they get breaks on fees product

84
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:48,419
manufacturing is exactly what it sounds

85
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:50,609
like retail is the actual selling to

86
00:03:48,419 --> 00:03:52,079
consumers research hasn't really gotten

87
00:03:50,609 --> 00:03:54,000
off the ground yet but we're hoping to

88
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:56,189
fill some of the gaps that we're hearing

89
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,079
from people in various aspects of the

90
00:03:56,188 --> 00:03:59,878
industry where the federal government is

91
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:02,189
not allowing them to move forward with

92
00:03:59,878 --> 00:04:04,438
research we want to do what we can do

93
00:04:02,188 --> 00:04:07,858
taking advantage of the great access we

94
00:04:04,438 --> 00:04:12,539
have in Massachusetts to folks that have

95
00:04:07,859 --> 00:04:15,180
labs etc as resources transporters are

96
00:04:12,539 --> 00:04:17,038
essentially a product of the farming

97
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:19,288
community telling us that cultivators

98
00:04:17,038 --> 00:04:20,459
wanted to grow the plant but they didn't

99
00:04:19,288 --> 00:04:21,959
necessarily want to have to drive it

100
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:24,389
anywhere because it requires a very

101
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:26,550
secure expensive vehicle and so we

102
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:28,199
created a category where those

103
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:30,598
we're investing in those vehicles could

104
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:33,389
monetize their fleet by leasing them out

105
00:04:30,598 --> 00:04:35,490
or you could have just a entirely

106
00:04:33,389 --> 00:04:36,840
independent transporting license where

107
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:40,199
that's all you do you don't otherwise

108
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:42,179
touch the plan independent testing labs

109
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:44,430
are the labs that assure us that what is

110
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:47,550
in the cannabis is actually inconsistent

111
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:51,269
with regulations and we also just

112
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:53,520
recently licensed delivery and social

113
00:04:51,269 --> 00:04:54,719
consumption social consumption is not

114
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:56,158
likely to get off the ground in

115
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,080
Massachusetts any time soon because

116
00:04:56,158 --> 00:05:00,288
there is a legislative hitch that needs

117
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:03,448
to be resolved before they can actually

118
00:05:00,288 --> 00:05:07,310
come to life so that gives you an idea

119
00:05:03,449 --> 00:05:09,810
of the framework we're working with so

120
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:12,348
here is the difference between the

121
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:15,360
existing medical industry and the adult

122
00:05:12,348 --> 00:05:17,639
industry in Massachusetts Medical when

123
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,860
it was implemented in 2013 is vertically

124
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:22,468
integrated so if you're a medical

125
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:24,090
licensee in Massachusetts you have all

126
00:05:22,468 --> 00:05:26,098
of these things

127
00:05:24,089 --> 00:05:27,598
deliveries off optional but you have

128
00:05:26,098 --> 00:05:29,370
cultivation product manufacturer and

129
00:05:27,598 --> 00:05:32,269
retail all under your corporate

130
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:35,879
structure adult is more similar to

131
00:05:32,269 --> 00:05:38,339
mainstream products you can choose to do

132
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:41,009
any one of those things on the medical

133
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:45,028
side hot tip we are going to be going

134
00:05:41,009 --> 00:05:48,629
through a regulatory round in 2020 and

135
00:05:45,028 --> 00:05:53,538
that vertical integration may come off

136
00:05:48,629 --> 00:05:56,310
and medical may be similar to adult so

137
00:05:53,538 --> 00:05:58,949
if this is of interest view please stay

138
00:05:56,310 --> 00:06:00,418
tuned to the regulatory process in 2020

139
00:05:58,949 --> 00:06:02,579
it will likely get going in the spring

140
00:06:00,418 --> 00:06:05,549
we'll talk more about that in a little

141
00:06:02,579 --> 00:06:08,008
bit but things in Massachusetts are not

142
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:09,569
done not settled in terms of regulations

143
00:06:08,009 --> 00:06:14,218
there's still one more regulatory round

144
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:18,210
to go through so here's our structure in

145
00:06:14,218 --> 00:06:21,028
terms of the day-to-day life of applying

146
00:06:18,209 --> 00:06:24,388
and receiving a license so you have the

147
00:06:21,028 --> 00:06:26,699
application process you see highlighted

148
00:06:24,389 --> 00:06:28,110
there is management operations profile

149
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:29,848
and the reason I'm highlighting it for

150
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:31,139
you is that's where the energy and

151
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:34,680
environmental compliance is going to

152
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:36,800
come into play in a few slides once you

153
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:39,449
go to the application process you are

154
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,009
granted a provisional license or denied

155
00:06:39,449 --> 00:06:43,169
one who knows

156
00:06:41,009 --> 00:06:44,908
if you are granted one the next step for

157
00:06:43,168 --> 00:06:46,500
you is to file plans for an

158
00:06:44,908 --> 00:06:47,399
architectural review we have to make

159
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,879
sure what you're building out is

160
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:52,228
actually compliant with our regulations

161
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:54,210
you will also have to go through local

162
00:06:52,228 --> 00:06:55,889
permits and licensing so again you see

163
00:06:54,209 --> 00:06:57,870
architectural review is highlighted in

164
00:06:55,889 --> 00:06:59,550
yellow and that is because that is where

165
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:02,728
we're going to be looking at your energy

166
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:04,379
and environmental compliance so you go

167
00:07:02,728 --> 00:07:05,550
through your final which is essentially

168
00:07:04,379 --> 00:07:10,530
you've gotten your certificate of

169
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:12,829
occupancy you can you know get all the

170
00:07:10,529 --> 00:07:15,209
inspections necessary to get to the next

171
00:07:12,829 --> 00:07:16,859
step which is the notice to commence

172
00:07:15,209 --> 00:07:18,239
operations that's the big deal that's

173
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:19,680
what you want in Massachusetts do not

174
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,509
that notice to commence operations

175
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,240
because that means in three days you

176
00:07:21,509 --> 00:07:26,009
could actually be operational and in

177
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,810
terms of energy and environmental use

178
00:07:26,009 --> 00:07:29,669
there we are going to have ongoing

179
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:30,990
engagement with our compliance staff to

180
00:07:29,668 --> 00:07:33,180
make sure that you are keeping up to

181
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:34,860
what you promised to do in your

182
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:37,949
management operations profile and your

183
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:40,439
architectural review when it comes to

184
00:07:37,949 --> 00:07:42,120
renewal which is annual in Massachusetts

185
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:43,979
there will be environmental reporting

186
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,389
using and we'll get into this in a

187
00:07:43,978 --> 00:07:47,490
little more detail the Cannabis power

188
00:07:45,389 --> 00:07:50,750
score so again thank you resource

189
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:53,400
innovation Institute for that as well as

190
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:57,088
updating a compliance letter that I'll

191
00:07:53,399 --> 00:08:00,359
talk about in more detail in a moment so

192
00:07:57,088 --> 00:08:04,288
again this is all background talking

193
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:06,419
about how we got to where we got to the

194
00:08:04,288 --> 00:08:10,378
initial regulations were published in

195
00:08:06,418 --> 00:08:12,568
March of 2018 and those that was where

196
00:08:10,379 --> 00:08:14,580
you first saw that thirty six kilowatt

197
00:08:12,569 --> 00:08:19,468
standard and there's a 50 kilowatt

198
00:08:14,579 --> 00:08:21,240
standard for smaller operators after the

199
00:08:19,468 --> 00:08:23,939
initial regulations were put in place

200
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:26,158
and that was after quite a bit of public

201
00:08:23,939 --> 00:08:28,949
comment I might add and a public hearing

202
00:08:26,158 --> 00:08:31,348
the working group convened and continued

203
00:08:28,949 --> 00:08:33,658
to have more public comment and invite

204
00:08:31,348 --> 00:08:35,698
more written comment from stakeholders

205
00:08:33,658 --> 00:08:38,278
and had multiple meetings of the working

206
00:08:35,698 --> 00:08:41,578
group to discuss developing guidances

207
00:08:38,278 --> 00:08:45,480
and the best management practices so

208
00:08:41,578 --> 00:08:48,359
then we got to 2019 and this was the

209
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:51,509
first amendment regulatory round because

210
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:53,850
we were initially so rushed in 2017 and

211
00:08:51,509 --> 00:08:55,649
2018 we told everybody

212
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:59,310
that we were going to have to reopen the

213
00:08:55,649 --> 00:09:01,919
regs again and we ended up doing it

214
00:08:59,309 --> 00:09:04,500
twice to address things that we just

215
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:07,169
didn't have time to deal with in the

216
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:09,120
first regulatory round we needed time to

217
00:09:07,169 --> 00:09:10,889
flesh out those details in energy and

218
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:14,310
environment were one of the things that

219
00:09:10,889 --> 00:09:16,370
got tackled in March of 2019 so we

220
00:09:14,309 --> 00:09:18,719
published draft amended regulations

221
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:20,459
which sort of elaborated on other

222
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,420
compliance pathways for energy and

223
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:26,518
environmental issues had public hearings

224
00:09:23,419 --> 00:09:28,979
did a discussion of draft amended

225
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:32,310
regulations and they finally went into

226
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:35,610
place in November 1st 2019 the reason I

227
00:09:32,309 --> 00:09:37,229
go through all that is to say that we

228
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:39,110
didn't get a lot of public comment on

229
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:42,089
the energy and environmental regulations

230
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:45,318
so one of the things I'm hoping to get

231
00:09:42,089 --> 00:09:48,269
out of this conference here today is

232
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:50,578
pathways to make sure that you all know

233
00:09:48,269 --> 00:09:52,198
that we're doing this because you all

234
00:09:50,578 --> 00:09:56,489
have valuable insight and perspective

235
00:09:52,198 --> 00:09:58,258
that we especially this person who is a

236
00:09:56,490 --> 00:10:02,278
lawyer not an energy and environmental

237
00:09:58,259 --> 00:10:03,870
person we need to get your input and if

238
00:10:02,278 --> 00:10:06,208
you don't even know the regulatory

239
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:09,568
process is happening we're not going to

240
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:11,938
get it so what I would like to do today

241
00:10:09,568 --> 00:10:13,169
is if you've looked at our regulations

242
00:10:11,938 --> 00:10:15,120
if you've looked at our guidance

243
00:10:13,169 --> 00:10:17,338
documents on the website and you have

244
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,528
questions because there's something that

245
00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:21,420
isn't quite clear to you give me those

246
00:10:19,528 --> 00:10:24,379
questions I probably can't answer them

247
00:10:21,419 --> 00:10:28,379
today but what we are going to do is

248
00:10:24,379 --> 00:10:30,000
publish a rolling FAQ on our website

249
00:10:28,379 --> 00:10:32,938
that takes the questions from the

250
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,778
cultivators from the engineers from the

251
00:10:32,938 --> 00:10:38,730
consultants and tries to give you you

252
00:10:36,778 --> 00:10:43,230
know as much guidance as we can about

253
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:46,560
how to do this to the best ability for

254
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:49,409
you and your clients so the regulations

255
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:51,750
are one thing the guidance how it works

256
00:10:49,409 --> 00:10:53,879
in Massachusetts the guidance interprets

257
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:57,089
the regulations and tells you what the

258
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:59,009
regulator's want to see in addition to

259
00:10:57,089 --> 00:11:00,420
the regulatory language itself and then

260
00:10:59,009 --> 00:11:02,970
the best management practices are

261
00:11:00,419 --> 00:11:05,308
literally that suggestions and fear not

262
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:07,570
those who are interested in that water

263
00:11:05,308 --> 00:11:10,179
use issue we are going to

264
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:12,910
and our water yeast guidance we did find

265
00:11:10,179 --> 00:11:18,699
out about the six gallon issue and we

266
00:11:12,909 --> 00:11:20,199
are addressing it so there are two

267
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:24,250
methods of trying to encourage

268
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:27,820
compliance one is the carrot this is our

269
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:31,179
carrot the Leadership Award essentially

270
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:34,180
provides an opportunity to be recognized

271
00:11:31,179 --> 00:11:36,069
for your excellence in your work your

272
00:11:34,179 --> 00:11:38,500
client's worth the licensees work in

273
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:42,040
achieving energy and environmental goals

274
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:44,830
now this is not just a pretty sticker on

275
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:47,169
your product or on your window look at

276
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:49,509
the bottom language these leadership

277
00:11:47,169 --> 00:11:52,509
ratings are taken into consideration if

278
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:55,019
your client gets in trouble for who

279
00:11:52,509 --> 00:11:58,720
knows you know something or another

280
00:11:55,019 --> 00:12:00,610
improper waste disposal as an example we

281
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:03,009
take the leadership rating into account

282
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:05,980
when we're considering the fine that

283
00:12:03,009 --> 00:12:09,610
could get levied or licensed action like

284
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:12,490
suspension or revocation so this is not

285
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:14,200
toothless this is actually a big deal so

286
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:17,919
this is something clients want to aspire

287
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:20,290
to and again this is something that may

288
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:23,319
get tweaked in the 2020 regulatory

289
00:12:20,289 --> 00:12:25,269
updates so partly because it needs to be

290
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:27,580
updated to address one internal

291
00:12:25,269 --> 00:12:29,559
conflicts but partly because I'd like to

292
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:32,200
have an opportunity to invite all of you

293
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:36,009
who are more familiar with how this

294
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:37,150
should work to give us some input what

295
00:12:36,009 --> 00:12:39,100
would you like to see if you were

296
00:12:37,149 --> 00:12:47,199
designing this yourself what would you

297
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:48,879
put so make your voice heard that was

298
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,730
the carrot let's talk about the stick

299
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:55,629
for a second so we went over this

300
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:56,980
framework earlier if you submit an

301
00:12:55,629 --> 00:12:58,929
energy plan as part of your management

302
00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:00,730
operations profile that we do not think

303
00:12:58,929 --> 00:13:02,679
is compliant what you're gonna get is a

304
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:05,080
request for information anyone familiar

305
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:08,289
with the Massachusetts process it's slow

306
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:10,270
in terms of Licensing we were confined

307
00:13:08,289 --> 00:13:11,529
to a very small space for a very long

308
00:13:10,269 --> 00:13:13,000
period of time and we couldn't hire

309
00:13:11,529 --> 00:13:14,889
enough staff to keep up with the volume

310
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,580
of applications that we had we're only

311
00:13:14,889 --> 00:13:20,830
just staffing up now so you don't want

312
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:22,600
an RFI you want to get it right

313
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:24,550
the first time because an RFI can slow

314
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:26,230
you down a month and if your client has

315
00:13:24,549 --> 00:13:27,250
carrying costs that are significant

316
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:28,960
because they're holding multiple

317
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:31,509
properties this is a significant

318
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:32,980
expenditure to them so definitely try to

319
00:13:31,509 --> 00:13:36,850
get it as right as you can the first

320
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:39,070
time same concept at the architectural

321
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:41,560
review phase if we see something in the

322
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:43,240
architectural review that does not seem

323
00:13:41,559 --> 00:13:48,069
like it's compliant you could get a

324
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:49,990
question as part of ongoing engagement

325
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:52,629
our inspectors have the right to inspect

326
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:53,950
your records anytime so you can get a

327
00:13:52,629 --> 00:13:57,700
question if they see something no they

328
00:13:53,950 --> 00:14:00,490
don't think is correct if we get to the

329
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:01,900
renewal stage and we see that you are

330
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:03,639
not compliant and you're supposed to be

331
00:14:01,899 --> 00:14:05,649
you could get a condition on your

332
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:07,509
license saying okay now you've only got

333
00:14:05,649 --> 00:14:11,319
60 days or there's going to be an issue

334
00:14:07,509 --> 00:14:14,370
and then we have the option obviously of

335
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:17,740
non renewal cease and desist order

336
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:18,820
suspensions fine so nothing that you

337
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:21,220
want to deal with I think that your

338
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:23,260
client wants to deal with so these are

339
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:24,670
the very various regulatory themes we

340
00:14:23,259 --> 00:14:28,509
had to deal with as we were developing

341
00:14:24,669 --> 00:14:30,610
all of this and I'm gonna fly through

342
00:14:28,509 --> 00:14:32,350
the basic requirements this is for

343
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:33,879
everybody but cultivators because this

344
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:35,680
is really an indoor agriculture

345
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:37,870
conference and you don't really need to

346
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:40,209
focus on the people who aren't

347
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:42,070
cultivating but I wanted to get the

348
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:43,750
information out there in addition to

349
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:46,090
what we have in our guidance is posted

350
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:48,549
online so again essentially the process

351
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:50,110
here is to get people engaged and try to

352
00:14:48,549 --> 00:14:53,229
get them to really consider energy

353
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:55,300
efficiency options and you'll see this

354
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:56,860
throughout again renewables have you

355
00:14:55,299 --> 00:14:59,769
thought about whether or not you can use

356
00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:01,720
renewables have you examined your demand

357
00:14:59,769 --> 00:15:05,620
and what you can do to reduce it and

358
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:07,120
then have you engaged in dealing with

359
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:08,500
the energy efficiency programs we have

360
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:12,549
mass save in Massachusetts and they're

361
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:15,580
amazing so to the extent you can work

362
00:15:12,549 --> 00:15:17,649
with them please do transporters and

363
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:20,620
delivery they have a different set of

364
00:15:17,649 --> 00:15:21,730
criteria you know so we're gonna deal

365
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,840
with them differently from other kind of

366
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:25,779
place and size and other kind of

367
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:29,290
cultivators cultivators we've already

368
00:15:25,779 --> 00:15:31,389
talked about data but this again is more

369
00:15:29,289 --> 00:15:33,839
detailed on the prior slide so we want

370
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:36,449
to get an energy plan that shows

371
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:37,920
that you're being thoughtful and really

372
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:42,570
getting ready to operate in an

373
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:43,589
energy-efficient way so you're going to

374
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:45,480
be submitting as part of the

375
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:46,950
architectural review process and energy

376
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,990
compliance letter or an energy

377
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:51,930
compliance exemption letter and a

378
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:54,539
third-party safety certification so

379
00:15:51,929 --> 00:15:57,149
these are the folks that need to fill

380
00:15:54,539 --> 00:15:58,439
out that letter for most people it's

381
00:15:57,149 --> 00:16:00,269
going to be a professional engineer a

382
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:02,880
registered architect but there are two

383
00:16:00,269 --> 00:16:04,110
other options for the smaller operators

384
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:05,669
or someone who demonstrates there

385
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:08,039
there's a reason they need to use

386
00:16:05,669 --> 00:16:10,169
someone else the one exception is the

387
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:11,759
HVAC and dehumidification requirements

388
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:13,979
do you need to be done by a mechanical

389
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:15,509
engineer or a professional engineer with

390
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:20,789
a license the covers mechanical

391
00:16:15,509 --> 00:16:22,590
engineering so it's it's relatively

392
00:16:20,789 --> 00:16:24,509
straightforward information that you

393
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:26,550
need and again it is literally

394
00:16:24,509 --> 00:16:29,429
demonstrating compliance in a way that

395
00:16:26,549 --> 00:16:31,319
is relatively easy for you relatively

396
00:16:29,429 --> 00:16:34,649
easy for us so there doesn't need to be

397
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:35,580
a lot of gray area so these are the

398
00:16:34,649 --> 00:16:38,549
things that are getting the most

399
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:40,590
questions now and in fact we even saw

400
00:16:38,549 --> 00:16:42,059
questions on social media where folks

401
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:45,440
are starting to talk to each other about

402
00:16:42,059 --> 00:16:48,059
how to measure compliance with this

403
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,530
that's fine but I would also suggest

404
00:16:48,059 --> 00:16:51,629
that you make sure those questions are

405
00:16:49,529 --> 00:16:54,990
coming into the commission because we

406
00:16:51,629 --> 00:16:57,179
want to make sure that the conversation

407
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:58,590
is happening with us not without us

408
00:16:57,179 --> 00:17:00,179
because we're the ones that will make

409
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:04,200
the decision whether or not what you're

410
00:17:00,179 --> 00:17:06,599
submitting is compliant there's some

411
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:10,110
additional information regard to that

412
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:12,689
with the HL PD requirements and then

413
00:17:10,109 --> 00:17:15,089
here is what came out of the 2019

414
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:18,539
amendments which is our partnership with

415
00:17:15,089 --> 00:17:21,480
the design lights consortium and their

416
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:24,990
ability to provide information to

417
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:27,000
applicants and licensees about equipment

418
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:28,950
that will be deemed to be compliant as

419
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,660
long as it meets their requirements and

420
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:33,090
they've built out a filter in their

421
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:34,650
software which is much appreciated and I

422
00:17:33,089 --> 00:17:38,490
think will be wonderful for especially

423
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:41,430
our smaller operators to be able to

424
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:43,230
determine compliance there's additional

425
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:45,090
information regarding that energy

426
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:47,990
compliance letter and what needs to be

427
00:17:45,089 --> 00:17:47,990
submitted with it

428
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:57,900
again on the HVAC side and then moving

429
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:59,700
forward to I safety protection of the

430
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:01,769
workers is very important this is

431
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:03,569
becoming an emergency an emerging issue

432
00:18:01,769 --> 00:18:06,629
for regulators in case you're not aware

433
00:18:03,569 --> 00:18:08,189
the concern that cannabis workers are

434
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:11,010
not being adequately protected by the

435
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:13,710
industry so hot tip from the regulator

436
00:18:11,009 --> 00:18:15,299
space pay attention to these issues

437
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:17,759
because I think you're going to hear

438
00:18:15,299 --> 00:18:21,659
increasing volume on them in the coming

439
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:23,970
months and years the energy compliance

440
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:26,640
exemption letter is the one that talks

441
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:30,720
about why you don't need to be compliant

442
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:33,930
with the HL PD or the H qpl because you

443
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:35,430
are generating 80% or more from a

444
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:41,190
renewable generating source of renewable

445
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:48,090
thermal generation and here under this

446
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:49,559
is set by Massachusetts law and here is

447
00:18:48,089 --> 00:18:56,209
what we'll expect to see in that energy

448
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:58,440
compliance exemption letter on renewal

449
00:18:56,210 --> 00:19:01,590
this is where the cannabis power score

450
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:05,190
comes in so we're going to collect the

451
00:19:01,589 --> 00:19:07,139
data about your energy consumption your

452
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:09,539
water consumption on-site energy

453
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:12,780
generation and cannabis yield by weight

454
00:19:09,539 --> 00:19:16,349
thanks to our partnership on the can of

455
00:19:12,779 --> 00:19:19,889
this power score and review that as part

456
00:19:16,349 --> 00:19:21,779
of renewal I'm sure you're all familiar

457
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:26,970
with the cannabis power score

458
00:19:21,779 --> 00:19:28,769
software but here it is now some of the

459
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:30,750
folks that are going to be coming into

460
00:19:28,769 --> 00:19:32,069
compliance have already gone through the

461
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:34,829
already operating so they haven't done

462
00:19:32,069 --> 00:19:37,829
the architectural review process yet if

463
00:19:34,829 --> 00:19:40,889
that applies to you or your client the

464
00:19:37,829 --> 00:19:42,240
renewal deadline becomes significant

465
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:44,190
because this is the first time you're

466
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,930
going to be supplying that energy

467
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:47,789
compliance or energy compliance

468
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:49,560
exemption letter if you aren't in

469
00:19:47,789 --> 00:19:51,990
operation yet you will do that as part

470
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:54,179
of the architectural review process but

471
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:55,319
if you're already up and running this is

472
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:57,210
the point where you're going to be

473
00:19:55,319 --> 00:20:00,839
submitting that in addition to providing

474
00:19:57,210 --> 00:20:02,759
the cannabis power score report

475
00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:04,740
so the deadline for existing operators

476
00:20:02,759 --> 00:20:08,819
to become compliant with all of this is

477
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:10,798
July 1st 2020 and we've provided an

478
00:20:08,819 --> 00:20:14,519
option for a further six month extension

479
00:20:10,798 --> 00:20:16,379
for certain folks if they agree to

480
00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:18,389
complete a comprehensive survey

481
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:21,539
regarding their energy and environmental

482
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:24,990
impacts and the report will be due on

483
00:20:21,538 --> 00:20:26,849
October 1st and an update will be due on

484
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:29,130
it's actually January 4th we figured out

485
00:20:26,849 --> 00:20:32,819
January 2nd is a Sunday don't worry no

486
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:34,230
one has to do it on Sunday but what we

487
00:20:32,819 --> 00:20:36,569
are trying to do is address the theme

488
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:38,460
that we heard earlier today more data

489
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:41,250
needed more data needed more data needed

490
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:43,110
this is a different kind of baseline

491
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:46,349
than what Nick was referring to earlier

492
00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:49,709
but it is a very comprehensive I think

493
00:20:46,349 --> 00:20:51,839
50 questions that goes into all the

494
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:55,409
equipment that you're using

495
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:57,298
what kind of and again this is a big

496
00:20:55,409 --> 00:20:59,130
debate what you word to use but we ended

497
00:20:57,298 --> 00:21:04,288
up using strains everyone can yell at me

498
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:08,669
at dinner I know but it's a lot of

499
00:21:04,288 --> 00:21:10,589
really nerdy weedy details that we think

500
00:21:08,669 --> 00:21:15,720
are important to gather and that we

501
00:21:10,589 --> 00:21:20,869
intend ultimately to publish on goodness

502
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:23,880
me forth brownie would be Alerus but no

503
00:21:20,869 --> 00:21:28,709
you know I'll make that suggestion how

504
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:31,289
about that for 2020 21 but we intend to

505
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:33,028
publish that on our open data platform

506
00:21:31,288 --> 00:21:35,038
so if you're not familiar with our open

507
00:21:33,028 --> 00:21:37,919
data platform Massachusetts is really

508
00:21:35,038 --> 00:21:40,829
dedicated to getting data and research

509
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:42,870
out there for government agencies for

510
00:21:40,829 --> 00:21:44,939
consultants for whoever to use for

511
00:21:42,869 --> 00:21:46,109
academics to use because we can

512
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:48,210
obviously gather a lot of information

513
00:21:46,109 --> 00:21:50,189
we're in this possession with this great

514
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:52,769
position of being able to gather all of

515
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:54,840
this information but we don't hoard it

516
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:56,490
and keep it to ourselves because it's

517
00:21:54,839 --> 00:21:57,928
important for the states that are coming

518
00:21:56,490 --> 00:22:01,319
online the countries that are coming

519
00:21:57,929 --> 00:22:04,019
online to have some idea of what they're

520
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:06,028
getting themselves into and what is

521
00:22:04,019 --> 00:22:09,000
going to come out of this industry

522
00:22:06,028 --> 00:22:11,009
legalizing in their community so we want

523
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,839
to make this information as available as

524
00:22:11,009 --> 00:22:15,788
we possibly can and that will include

525
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:21,069
the survey information that we get off

526
00:22:15,788 --> 00:22:22,750
the energy Extension report so bottom

527
00:22:21,069 --> 00:22:25,210
line and the things that I want you to

528
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:26,650
take away from this are one let's find a

529
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:28,808
way to better engage with each other

530
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:31,778
because I want to hear a lot more

531
00:22:28,808 --> 00:22:34,210
information coming to the regulators in

532
00:22:31,778 --> 00:22:36,220
the 2020 round and I would encourage you

533
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:39,069
not only to engage with Massachusetts

534
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:41,500
but we know we all know we have other

535
00:22:39,069 --> 00:22:43,210
states coming online and you have an

536
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:45,429
opportunity to get in on the ground

537
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:48,700
floor and all these states that are

538
00:22:45,429 --> 00:22:51,640
considering legalizing cannabis and

539
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:53,200
doing it in an energy responsible way

540
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:55,120
and the only way they're going to be

541
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,190
able to do that sensibly and in a way

542
00:22:55,119 --> 00:22:59,678
that's data-driven is if they hear from

543
00:22:57,190 --> 00:23:01,419
you so you can start with me and tell me

544
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:02,798
all the questions you have about

545
00:23:01,419 --> 00:23:04,090
Massachusetts so I can take it back to

546
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:06,460
my team and then throw it up on our

547
00:23:04,089 --> 00:23:08,740
website but I would also encourage you

548
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:10,600
to do that with other states and let's

549
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:12,429
face it we've got federal officials that

550
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:13,750
are probably looking at this and trying

551
00:23:12,429 --> 00:23:14,950
to figure out going down the road

552
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:16,990
depending on what happens with the

553
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:18,700
election what we're going to do on a

554
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:21,009
federal level so we need to make sure

555
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:23,558
that they're informed about how to do

556
00:23:21,009 --> 00:23:25,450
this in an energy efficient way because

557
00:23:23,558 --> 00:23:28,480
we're hearing the candidates are rolling

558
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:30,970
out these legalization plans but in my

559
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:33,130
view any of these plans whether you're a

560
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:35,409
state official or federal official or in

561
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:37,510
another country if you're not addressing

562
00:23:35,409 --> 00:23:40,510
energy and environmental impacts in

563
00:23:37,509 --> 00:23:43,808
these plans your legalization plan is

564
00:23:40,509 --> 00:23:45,220
not yet complete so please join me get

565
00:23:43,808 --> 00:23:46,750
in touch with them get in touch with me

566
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:49,149
and let's all see if we can do this

567
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:51,630
together in an energy efficient way and

568
00:23:49,148 --> 00:23:59,248
that's it

569
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:59,249
[Applause]
