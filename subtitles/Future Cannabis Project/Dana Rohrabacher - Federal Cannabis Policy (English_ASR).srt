filled with alligators and sharks and

133
00:06:09,478 --> 00:06:16,240

134

the most courageous well I will give a

139
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:31,478
million dollars to any of you who will

140
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,680
jump in that pool and swim to the end

141
00:06:31,478 --> 00:06:35,359
and they're all looking at each other

142
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:36,720
and nobody steps forward of course says

143
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,479
okay I didn't think any of you were

144
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,280
going to take that deal come on down we

145
00:06:38,478 --> 00:06:42,959
got a barbecue down here and as they go

146
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:44,638
down for the barbecue hears a splash and

147
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:46,560
he looks into the pool and there's a guy

148
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,800
swimming across the pool beating away

149
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,519
the Sharks and the alligators finally he

150
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,400
crawls up on the end of the pool and the

151
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:54,598
guy says my God I didn't think anybody

152
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:56,638
would do it but you're going to get your

153
00:06:54,598 --> 00:06:58,038
million dollars and he says I don't care

154
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:01,519
about the million dollars I want to find

155
00:06:58,038 --> 00:07:01,519
out who pushed me in that pool

156
00:07:02,598 --> 00:07:07,719
uh so here I am in Washington I don't

157
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:12,000
know what that has to do with shark

158
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:15,000
pools but uh yes uh sometimes Washington

159
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,478
can be a shark pit for people who are

160
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,199
principled and I have tried to be

161
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:21,758
principled which means that I make

162
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:24,280
people on the liberal side of the end of

163
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:26,360
the spectrum mad at me half the time

164
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:28,559
really mad at me and people in the

165
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:31,038
conservative end of the spectrum really

166
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,918
mad at me half the the time but that's

167
00:07:31,038 --> 00:07:34,839
okay I mean I believe in what I'm doing

168
00:07:32,918 --> 00:07:36,878
and that's what it's all about isn't it

169
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:38,478
and one thing that I believe in is I

170
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:40,800
believe that this country was founded on

171
00:07:38,478 --> 00:07:43,240
the ideal of individual freedom and

172
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,478
liberty and it is up to adults to

173
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:48,079
determine for themselves what they

174
00:07:45,478 --> 00:07:53,120
consume on their property period zero

175
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:53,120
that's what freedom is and

176
00:07:53,560 --> 00:08:00,560
uh and this idea of Ideal where we have

177
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,840
limited government

178
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,360
and where you have individual personal

179
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:08,758
responsibility for themselves for

180
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:10,840
ourselves this idea where you have uh

181
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:13,400
constitutional rights and you have

182
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:15,679
criminal law being handled at one end of

183
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:18,359
locally and not at the at the federal

184
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,000
level these are all fundamental things

185
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:24,240
that our country was supposed to be

186
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,519
about and these are uh but a lot of

187
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,280
people have been talking about doctor

188
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:30,359
patient relationship that's another

189
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:32,478
principle that we've always lived with

190
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:34,599
the doctor patient relationship

191
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:37,038
marijuana laws in this country have

192
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:40,839
violated every basic principle this

193
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:43,918
country stands for for the last 75 years

194
00:08:40,839 --> 00:08:43,919
it's time to stop

195
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:53,759
it and um so well I have always voted

196
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:56,639
for uh liberalizing marijuana laws

197
00:08:53,759 --> 00:09:00,120
whether medical or adult use

198
00:08:56,639 --> 00:09:04,078
marijuana uh this it's there as we all

199
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:07,159
know there are serious uh side effects

200
00:09:04,078 --> 00:09:10,799
to having something outlawed like

201
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:13,719
marijuana and uh and that is uh we end

202
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:17,759
up with a situation where money that

203
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:20,120
would be going to uh local clinics or

204
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:22,838
whatever or or financing a regular

205
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:25,278
business now end up in the hands of drug

206
00:09:22,839 --> 00:09:28,040
cartels in different parts of the world

207
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:30,838
undermining Democratic institutions so

208
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:34,719
there's actually a by product that is

209
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:39,040
felt elsewhere and also of course uh we

210
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:42,120
have basically turned uh the police uh

211
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:44,199
into a situation where they now have an

212
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:47,360
excuse to stop just about anybody and

213
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:49,240
frisk them which I do think is not what

214
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,240
our founding fathers had in mind for

215
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:54,879
Freedom when they talked about liberty

216
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:57,600
and justice for all and of course they

217
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:59,759
never they never foresaw a federal

218
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,120
police force like like we've established

219
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:05,919
now with the DEA coming into local

220
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:07,679
communities bashing down doors trying to

221
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:11,159
excuse this by the fact that somebody

222
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:13,519
has a little baggie of of weeds for Pete

223
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:15,600
sakes and see uh you know this is why we

224
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:18,879
were able to go in and Bash down that

225
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:21,159
door then we end up what giving military

226
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:23,159
equipment to people who are coming into

227
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:25,799
our own communities it's

228
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:29,399
ridiculous and so this has had a very

229
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:31,039
serious negative impact more than just

230
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:33,679
the individual freedom but individual

231
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:35,559
Freedom was enough for me so with that

232
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:37,919
said I've been trying to vote this way

233
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:41,000
and I failed for many years I've been in

234
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:42,919
Congress now 28 years but I finally

235
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,200
found the formula with some of my

236
00:10:42,919 --> 00:10:46,199
colleagues on the other side of the

237
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:49,879
aisle on the Democratic site of the

238
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:54,160
aisle and uh that formula was

239
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:57,838
Republicans believe in states rights the

240
00:10:54,159 --> 00:11:00,480
10th Amendment they always talk about it

241
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:05,920
so I said let's challenge

242
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:07,480
uh let's say that if a State legalizes

243
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:09,879
the use of medical

244
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:13,600
marijuana the federal government cannot

245
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:15,278
use the funds that we have to supersede

246
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,079
what the people of that state have

247
00:11:15,278 --> 00:11:19,879
already decided and

248
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:23,120
uh

249
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:24,600
that that amendment that Amendment

250
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,039
because instead of doing the job

251
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,240
ourselves and saying this is the law for

252
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:31,559
the whole country we left it up to the

253
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:35,360
states and with that in

254
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:38,879
2014 I was able to pass what they call

255
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:41,399
the roacher far Amendment which I'll

256
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:44,120
give you the exact numbers of the of the

257
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:46,559
vote which was

258
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:49,120
219 to

259
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:52,039
189 so what does that tell you that's a

260
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:55,959
pretty close vote I uh what made the

261
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:58,439
difference was that we had Republicans

262
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:59,919
coming over and supporting the idea of

263
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,880
states rights

264
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:04,278
and without that we would not have had

265
00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:06,639
the success that we've had and since

266
00:12:04,278 --> 00:12:10,639
that time of course we've had these

267
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:14,440
years since 2014 till now where we've

268
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:16,480
had uh a new industry being created

269
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:21,440
based on the idea that you have states

270
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:23,440
rights and the people of 45 states have

271
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,720
somewhat modified if not totally

272
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:29,440
legalize the use of medical

273
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:32,000
marijuana uh we just recently

274
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:35,120
as you was announced uh

275
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,919
yesterday uh was a big day because I

276
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:40,399
obviously I had to work to see that the

277
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:42,599
roacher far Amendment which says the

278
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:45,000
federal isn't going to interfere I had

279
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:47,480
to work really hard to make sure it was

280
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,958
in the Omnibus Bill which is a a bill of

281
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:51,959
all sorts of things put together to keep

282
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:55,638
the federal government running till

283
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:58,559
October now uh it didn't so the roacher

284
00:12:55,639 --> 00:13:01,600
4 Amendment didn't just appear by Magic

285
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:04,359
you know I had to really run around and

286
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:09,320
talk to people and twist arms and all

287
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:11,959
the rest so uh and they uh of course uh

288
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:15,040
we managed to succeed and let me just

289
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:18,359
note that yesterday we succeeded in in

290
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:20,360
placing Roar again making sure the law

291
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:22,278
was in that we it's legal in those

292
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,839
States where people want to use medical

293
00:13:22,278 --> 00:13:27,759
marijuana where the states have made it

294
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:32,720
legal uh that happened it just happened

295
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:34,799
the same day as National Prayer day so I

296
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,480
just as a Believer I say further proof

297
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:41,078
of the existence of God we won that one

298
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:44,519
there you go and

299
00:13:41,078 --> 00:13:47,799
uh so what is the uh what do we stand

300
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:52,519
now and what's uh why why we must do

301
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:56,479
things look uh the the side one of the

302
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:57,720
side effects of all of this control you

303
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,600
see there are certain people who believe

304
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:02,600
in the nanny State they believe that

305
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:04,839
government should be watching out for us

306
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:06,800
even in our personal decisions you know

307
00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:08,639
we got to have you can't buy a big glass

308
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:11,639
of Coke it has to be a medium-sized

309
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:14,919
class of coke now no no I don't believe

310
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:17,240
in that but a large number both

311
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:19,000
conservatives and liberals believe that

312
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:20,480
we're going to try to watch out for

313
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,078
people by controlling their own

314
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:27,560
decisions over their own lives and we

315
00:14:24,078 --> 00:14:30,000
now have to make sure that

316
00:14:27,559 --> 00:14:32,479
that benevolent

317
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,519
uh feeling and reason for being involved

318
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:38,639
does not oversee what we consider to be

319
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:41,560
personal freedom and liberty and there's

320
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:43,159
been serious consequences to that and

321
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:45,758
one of the serious consequences has been

322
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:48,600
we have not done the medical research on

323
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:51,560
the on the cannabis plant that we should

324
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:54,959
have I mean there is no reason in the

325
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:58,078
world why a cannabis plant has not been

326
00:14:54,958 --> 00:15:01,479
the focus of major research to see if it

327
00:14:58,078 --> 00:15:03,159
can help us people in various situations

328
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:05,720
why is it that we can do research on

329
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:09,799
opium but we can't do research on

330
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:09,800
cannabis how stupid is

331
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:19,720
that so anyway uh I have uh you know

332
00:15:16,839 --> 00:15:22,560
there's a an an epidemic now as we know

333
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:24,040
in opiates across this country and I'm

334
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:27,319
going to leave you with one story and

335
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:29,559
just say we need to make sure every

336
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:31,759
member of the house if you have a uh if

337
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:34,039
you're not in my district uh make sure

338
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:36,120
you contact your member of the House to

339
00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:37,639
support this this this thing this

340
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:40,318
situation with us that's really

341
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:41,879
important for you to do second of all

342
00:15:40,318 --> 00:15:44,318
there was a statement issued by the

343
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:47,639
president of the United States uh I

344
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:51,439
think it was today uh explaining why he

345
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:53,720
did sign into law uh the Omnibus Bill

346
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:57,600
and that reflecting directly on the

347
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:59,160
roacher far Amendment and he stated uh

348
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:02,120
some people in the Cannabis community

349
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:03,679
think it's a little bit uh uh nebulous

350
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:05,159
and it is nebulous every time you get

351
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:06,479
involved with with lawyers and

352
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:09,759
politicians things are going to be

353
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:12,519
nebulous so people can maneuver but uh

354
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:13,959
but nebulous doesn't mean we've lost

355
00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:16,560
doesn't mean we've lost ground it just

356
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:18,359
means it's nebulous and it's up to us to

357
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:21,439
try to make sure that people go the

358
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:25,159
right course uh and the president said

359
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:27,880
that he would uh uh he noted our the

360
00:16:25,159 --> 00:16:31,719
amendment and then he noted that uh uh

361
00:16:27,879 --> 00:16:35,720
but he will be enforcing the law now

362
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:37,920
does he mean enforcing the law as as Rob

363
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:41,240
backer far does he mean the law that

364
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:43,278
makes marijuana illegal federally well

365
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:45,240
there there's a contradiction there

366
00:16:43,278 --> 00:16:47,720
however the ninth Circuit Court of

367
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:50,039
Appeals and several other courts have

368
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:52,720
cided with us saying it is clear that

369
00:16:50,039 --> 00:16:55,599
the intention of Congress now is that

370
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:58,040
federal agents shall not go out and try

371
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,680
to supersede state law in those in those

372
00:16:58,039 --> 00:17:02,278
states where they legalized medical

373
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:05,359
marijuana so for the president actually

374
00:17:02,278 --> 00:17:07,720
to enforce the law at least up until the

375
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:11,078
the the Circuit Court of Appeals level

376
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:12,720
the court system is siding with us and

377
00:17:11,078 --> 00:17:15,399
not with those people who would just

378
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:17,838
take us back to the Dark Ages where your

379
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:20,240
lives are all going to be controlled for

380
00:17:17,838 --> 00:17:22,720
your benefits you know no that's not

381
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,919
going to hopefully we're going to that

382
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,400
if we have to in fact if we have to take

383
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:29,440
it all the way to the Supreme Court we

384
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:31,640
will win we will win on this because we

385
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:34,160
have already gone through several Court

386
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:36,280
layers and the judges understand that

387
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:39,880
that's the intent of Congress and that

388
00:17:36,279 --> 00:17:41,519
is thus the law so don't freak out when

389
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:43,000
you're here when you look at the

390
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:44,798
president's statement and think that

391
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,679
well that leaves open other Alternatives

392
00:17:44,798 --> 00:17:49,960
it does but we have other forces at play

393
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:52,038
as well legal forces I'm going to leave

394
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:53,640
you with that and let others get up and

395
00:17:52,038 --> 00:17:56,440
and talk but I want to leave you with

396
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:57,960
with uh one story and uh some of you

397
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:00,519
have heard me tell that story but I'm

398
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:04,960
going to tell finish it tonight in in a

399
00:18:00,519 --> 00:18:07,440
different way and that is uh as most of

400
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:10,000
you know I was elected mainly I was

401
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:12,480
elected 28 years ago because I had been

402
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,960
Ronald Reagan's principal speech writer

403
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:19,558
in the white house for seven years and

404
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:23,079
that sort of impressed people here I uh

405
00:18:19,558 --> 00:18:24,359
you know I I had no money I Had No Name

406
00:18:23,079 --> 00:18:26,199
ID because when you're a speech writer

407
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:28,479
for the president you're you're supposed

408
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,880
to be a ghost writer and I I held that

409
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,839
stand

410
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:36,120
and so I had no money and no name ID but

411
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:38,558
I had 50 pictures of myself with Ronald

412
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:40,798
Reagan and I won by a landslide of

413
00:18:38,558 --> 00:18:43,480
course with the and my people are they

414
00:18:40,798 --> 00:18:46,918
all outspent me Etc

415
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:48,000
well uh so I was elected as as the

416
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:50,600
Reagan

417
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:54,240
Republican and even you know I tell I

418
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:55,719
had a beard then and uh so that was

419
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:59,159
really cool they elected me even though

420
00:18:55,720 --> 00:19:01,600
I had a beard and and I I had to shave

421
00:18:59,159 --> 00:19:03,760
it cuz my wife well right before we got

422
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:04,879
married she she she pulls this one on me

423
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:08,158
you know I'm not going to get married to

424
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:10,360
a man with a beard you know come on you

425

the beard okay so I shaved the beard and

427
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:18,280
I remember I was walking downtown in

428
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:20,280
Huntington Beach and I said to myself

429
00:19:18,279 --> 00:19:22,240
you know my constituents they remember

430
00:19:20,279 --> 00:19:24,558
they all know me with the beard you know

431
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:27,480
Reagan uh roacher is the guy with the

432
00:19:24,558 --> 00:19:29,918
beard next to Reagan and so I said well

433
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:31,679
I'm GNA walk down talked to some voters

434
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,120
and I stopped this guy said hey I'm

435
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:34,798
running for congress and I want your

436
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:37,119
vote the guy looks at me he says you got

437
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:39,480
it buddy that bearded bum who represents

438
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:39,479
us

439
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:47,918
now but let me leave you one this last

440
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:49,678
thought I didn't know what this would

441
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:51,720
mean for me all I knew is I believed in

442
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:53,640
individual freedom and I believe in what

443
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:55,759
our founding fathers had in mind for our

444
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:58,159
country that's all I knew when I got

445
00:19:55,759 --> 00:20:00,038
involved with this particular issue and

446
00:19:58,159 --> 00:20:01,960
I didn't know that I had some very

447
00:20:00,038 --> 00:20:04,919
conservative supporters and didn't know

448
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:07,960
how they would react so there was a guy

449
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:09,759
who came into my office who was a uh

450
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:12,319
retired military officer who was now was

451
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:15,480
in Aerospace and I asked him and he was

452
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:18,480
the typical roacher voter so I said

453
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:20,038
okay uh how do you feel about the fact

454
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,839
that the guy you've been supporting all

455
00:20:20,038 --> 00:20:25,119
this time is the point person for

456
00:20:22,839 --> 00:20:26,119
legalizing medical marijuana in the

457
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:29,839
United

458
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:31,558
States and he looked at me he said

459
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:32,759
uh you don't really know me that well do

460
00:20:31,558 --> 00:20:35,359
you and I said well you're in the

461
00:20:32,759 --> 00:20:37,919
military and a pilot and now you're in

462
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:40,240
Aerospace and I says yeah but what you

463
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:44,360
don't know is I have three sons two of

464
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:47,000
them or three of them uh marched off the

465
00:20:44,359 --> 00:20:50,599
day after 911 and signed up for the

466
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:53,159
military okay and so I said yeah said a

467
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:54,599
couple years later two of them came home

468
00:20:53,159 --> 00:20:57,600
the third one who came home wasn't my

469
00:20:54,599 --> 00:20:59,119
son anymore he was on the ground in

470
00:20:57,599 --> 00:21:02,319
convulsions

471
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:06,558
and what could I do and and he said

472
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:08,839
nothing we did could help him and uh and

473
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:10,359
and he said we took him to the VA and by

474
00:21:08,839 --> 00:21:13,079
the way this is sinful that we don't

475
00:21:10,359 --> 00:21:15,678
allow the VA to handle anything that can

476
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:19,839
help our veterans should be given to

477
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:21,600
them so anyway went to the VA he says it

478
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:23,480
wasn't helping them and they kept giving

479
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:26,599
him giving these other things that may

480
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:28,798
turn him into a zombie and finally after

481
00:21:26,599 --> 00:21:31,480
a year he said some guy from VA pulled

482
00:21:28,798 --> 00:21:33,319
us aside come and see me downtown we did

483
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:37,240
he said look I can't tell you this at

484
00:21:33,319 --> 00:21:39,200
the VA property but uh he said uh you

485
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:41,359
your son needs marijuana here's a

486
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,558
prescription here's how to use it and he

487
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:49,158
says you know my son hasn't had a

488
00:21:43,558 --> 00:21:50,359
seizure since that day now now he said

489
00:21:49,159 --> 00:21:53,440
so I'm going to come over and give you a

490
00:21:50,359 --> 00:21:55,158
hug okay but he called me a couple days

491
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:58,640
ago so if you guys have heard that story

492
00:21:55,159 --> 00:22:01,080
before he called me a couple days ago

493
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:03,679
and how is your son are the seizures

494
00:22:01,079 --> 00:22:06,240
still gone he says yeah the seizures are

495
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:09,519
still gone but there's a problem I said

496
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:11,480
what's the problem well the VA has got

497
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:14,038
him addicted to these opiates and he's

498
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:15,679
like a zombie and they want to and when

499
00:22:14,038 --> 00:22:18,519
they try to take him

500
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:20,640
off they they're insisting that they he

501
00:22:18,519 --> 00:22:23,839
stops using the mar the marijuana as

502
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:28,360
well and the seizures come

503
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:31,720
back this is outrageous this is insane

504
00:22:28,359 --> 00:22:35,079
and and I will tell you right now uh uh

505
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:37,079
the oh and then here's what he told me

506
00:22:35,079 --> 00:22:41,038
he says and and we're in a crisis and we

507
00:22:37,079 --> 00:22:43,960
need your help his son was there and

508
00:22:41,038 --> 00:22:45,319
they were trying to get him off opiates

509
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:46,360
and then they're demanding takes care of

510
00:22:45,319 --> 00:22:49,918
everything which is going to throw him

511
00:22:46,359 --> 00:22:51,798
into a seizure so he went out in the car

512
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:56,278
uh to consume some

513
00:22:51,798 --> 00:22:59,639
cannabis now the people who guard our VA

514
00:22:56,278 --> 00:23:03,359
hospitals uh the the the parking lot are

515
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:06,080
federal employees and they arrested

516
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:09,639
him and they said will you help and of

517
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:13,038
course I'm going to help for God's sakes

518
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:14,720
this is a this is the type of nonsense

519
00:23:13,038 --> 00:23:17,440
and and just

520
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:19,240
inhumane ignorance that comes when

521
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:22,159
people are trying to run other people's

522
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:24,759
lives for them yeah everybody can be

523
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:27,919
well I'm sure the people who made these

524
00:23:24,759 --> 00:23:30,558
uh decisions were well intended just

525
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:33,080
like those congressman who voted for one

526
00:23:30,558 --> 00:23:36,678
of the bills we put up that said the VA

527
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:39,319
will be free to uh to prescribe Mar

528
00:23:36,679 --> 00:23:41,400
medical marijuana in those states where

529
00:23:39,319 --> 00:23:44,720
medical marijuana is legal and that was

530
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:46,278
defeated by like three or four votes now

531
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,720
I'm not those people who voted against

532
00:23:46,278 --> 00:23:51,200
that they were not mean-spirited they

533
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:53,440
don't want this man to suffer but we now

534
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:55,640
know we have to get the word to these

535
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:57,400
people that the not only the veterans

536
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:59,880
but our senior citizens and every and

537
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:03,519
lots of other people are suffering

538
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:06,559
because of this effort on their part to

539
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:09,440
protect them from themselves how stupid

540
00:24:06,558 --> 00:24:11,720
is that we are smarter than that but

541
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,080
they all have good Souls you know we're

542
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:15,960
not telling the telling you these are

543
00:24:13,079 --> 00:24:17,759
evil people doing this no it's not we

544
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:20,278
need to reach out to those people and

545
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:23,278
change the law and give freedom to our

546
00:24:20,278 --> 00:24:25,359
people and give some help to those

547
00:24:23,278 --> 00:24:26,960
people are suffering who cannabis can

548
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:29,959
help so God bless you thank you very

549
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,960
much

550
00:24:32,119 --> 00:24:35,558
so first I'm going to go to Dana I'm not

551
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:37,159
going to ask about the pool and the

552
00:24:35,558 --> 00:24:41,599
snakes and the

553
00:24:37,159 --> 00:24:43,679
crocodiles um so a lot of people in here

554
00:24:41,599 --> 00:24:45,158
are thinking they're either in the

555
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:48,240
business thinking about getting the

556
00:24:45,159 --> 00:24:52,000
business um and the question I get asked

557
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:54,519
most often is Jeff

558
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,480
sessions what do we think Mr sessions

559
00:24:54,519 --> 00:24:59,679
might do as he tipped his hand coal

560
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:02,720
letter that kind of thing

561
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:04,960
Jeff sessions uh Jeff sessions is a very

562
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:08,399
good friend of mine I've known him for

563
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:10,960
30 years uh he's in factly more than

564
00:25:08,398 --> 00:25:13,398
that I actually met him when I was still

565
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:15,278
a teenager and he was a teenager and we

566
00:25:13,398 --> 00:25:17,158
were involved in conservative

567
00:25:15,278 --> 00:25:19,000
organizations and every one of the

568
00:25:17,159 --> 00:25:22,000
conservative organizations that we were

569
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:24,440
part of uh uh stressed uh the

570
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,319
constitutional government including the

571
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:29,038
10th Amendment to the

572
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:32,599
Constitution uh which leaves things like

573
00:25:29,038 --> 00:25:38,000
this up to the states and I have

574
00:25:32,599 --> 00:25:40,519
reminded him of that many times and uh

575
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:45,079
so uh let me just

576
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:47,960
note uh he he is an honest man and a

577
00:25:45,079 --> 00:25:50,879
person who's got a good heart and just

578
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:52,679
like a lot of people who want to help

579
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:55,640
you along by telling you what to do with

580
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:57,759
your personal life they are very well

581
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:59,080
motivated in that they really have good

582
00:25:57,759 --> 00:26:02,679
Hearts they're they think they're

583
00:25:59,079 --> 00:26:05,678
helping you out and Jeff thinks that how

584
00:26:02,679 --> 00:26:09,120
horrible it is when he's seen you know

585
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:10,720
he came up in the 60s and saw people who

586
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:14,599
were you

587
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:17,360
know getting really wild and that's

588
00:26:14,599 --> 00:26:20,359
impacted on his vision of what it's

589
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:23,719
going to be like uh so it's it's

590
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:26,479
difficult to tell him that yes normal

591
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:29,480
people and actually people you like like

592
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:31,240
veterans and Senior cens and a lot of

593
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:34,558
other people not just young people

594
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:36,919
wanting to get wild uh need to have the

595
00:26:34,558 --> 00:26:39,599
freedom to use cannabis and that should

596
00:26:36,919 --> 00:26:43,159
be up to the state government and the

597
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:44,959
people therein uh quite frankly I am uh

598
00:26:43,159 --> 00:26:47,120
I was here not as a federal

599
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,880
representative I wouldn't think I'd want

600
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:51,119
as much regulation as we're talking

601
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:54,320
about here in the state of

602
00:26:51,119 --> 00:27:00,599
California uh but that's up to you not

603
00:26:54,319 --> 00:27:03,240
up to me and uh the uh but Jeff sessions

604
00:27:00,599 --> 00:27:04,719
uh I talked to him I will have to admit

605
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:07,960
I talked to him

606
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:10,440
yesterday and uh on a number of subjects

607
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:12,960
this was one of them and we have agreed

608
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:16,440
that we're going to have a meeting where

609
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:18,919
we will indepth look at this issue and

610
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:21,480
uh you can just rest assured I don't

611
00:27:18,919 --> 00:27:24,440
know if you uh after listening to me

612
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:27,399
speak if I hope that you trust the fact

613
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:29,759
that I learned my lessons about

614
00:27:27,398 --> 00:27:31,798
Communications from Ronald Reagan the

615
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:35,759
the great communicator and I will put

616
00:27:31,798 --> 00:27:38,679
all of those to work to try to expand

617
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:40,640
the realm of freedom for you to live

618
00:27:38,679 --> 00:27:42,759
your lives and those people who want to

619
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:46,000
use cannabis to go right ahead and use

620
00:27:42,759 --> 00:27:49,038
it adults to use that cannabis I will do

621
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:53,519
everything I can in that discussion with

622
00:27:49,038 --> 00:27:55,960
Jeff to push freedom for us and I'll do

623
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:59,038
my best and I can't tell you I can I I

624
00:27:55,960 --> 00:28:01,360
can only predict this if session goes

625
00:27:59,038 --> 00:28:04,398
the wrong way and convinces the

626
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:07,319
president to reverse his position in the

627
00:28:04,398 --> 00:28:09,959
campaign remember the president

628
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:12,599
specifically said in the campaign

629
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:14,399
medical marijuana should be legal and

630
00:28:12,599 --> 00:28:18,359
adult youth should be left up to the

631
00:28:14,398 --> 00:28:21,518
states he said that several times now if

632
00:28:18,359 --> 00:28:24,759
Jeff uh convinced president to renig on

633
00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:27,399
that I'm sorry but I will tell you this

634
00:28:24,759 --> 00:28:30,158
much I will tell him that I have no

635
00:28:27,398 --> 00:28:32,079
doubt that it will go to the courts and

636
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:35,240
then and the and the Circuit Court 9th

637
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:38,240
Circuit Court of Appeals has already

638
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:41,919
verified our position on this and we

639
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:44,440
don't expect other judges to find fault

640
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:47,519
with those with that decision so it will

641
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:49,840
be a huge waste of his time and money

642
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:53,000
and why wouldn't he do that so I'll make

643
00:28:49,839 --> 00:28:53,000
the case we'll see what

644
00:28:53,558 --> 00:28:56,558
happens

645
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:01,759
Dana so

646
00:28:59,038 --> 00:29:03,519
what is your advice to people in the

647
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:06,879
business thinking about entering the

648
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:09,480
business growing a few plants at home

649
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:12,559
or if I put out something and said you

650
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:15,360
should invest with me what advice would

651
00:29:12,558 --> 00:29:18,720
you give those people today in

652
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:23,000
2017 in May of 2017 the issue has not

653
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:25,600
been definitely settled yet so people

654
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:28,159
who are putting money out there are

655
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:30,558
entrepreneurs who are putting money in

656
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:32,760
into the Cannabis business and

657
00:29:30,558 --> 00:29:35,879
especially the medical dispensary

658
00:29:32,759 --> 00:29:38,679
business and they are taking a great

659
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:41,399
risk uh there are profits that should

660
00:29:38,679 --> 00:29:43,519
come from risks that's that's as simple

661
00:29:41,398 --> 00:29:47,639
as that this is the way free enterprise

662
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:51,640
system works and uh I would hope that uh

663
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:54,120
no one here begrudges them once it uh

664
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:58,559
becomes legal in this state and if we

665
00:29:54,119 --> 00:30:02,278
manage to secure the uh uh this

666
00:29:58,558 --> 00:30:06,000
uh Arena uh from federal intervention I

667
00:30:02,278 --> 00:30:09,119
hope no one here uh begrudges these

668
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:11,720
people the right to make a profit and I

669
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:14,158
know this is the Republican part of my

670
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:15,679
personality coming out here but you have

671
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:17,880
a lot of people right now are taking

672
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:22,559
great risks in order to get medical

673
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:25,799
marijuana to people who need it and yes

674
00:30:22,558 --> 00:30:28,879
uh they should uh if if we move forward

675
00:30:25,798 --> 00:30:31,960
which is not certain yet I mean

676
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:34,760
uh not only Jeff sessions but who knows

677
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:37,640
uh uh even I don't have to tell you

678
00:30:34,759 --> 00:30:40,759
folks but during Obama and now even

679
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:43,360
during Jerry Brown

680
00:30:40,759 --> 00:30:45,919
uh I have not gotten the cooperation

681
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:49,519
from the Democrat side that I thought I

682
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:52,200
was going to get I mean uh we the the

683
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:54,599
the uh Attorney General's office under

684
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:57,240
Obama did was not supportive of the

685
00:30:54,599 --> 00:30:58,719
efforts that I was making uh we made

686
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:00,839
that despite

687
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:03,480
what was going on with the president and

688
00:31:00,839 --> 00:31:05,439
the Attorney General then and of course

689
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:08,919
Jerry Brown has not stepped up to the

690
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:11,558
plate either so you don't have it's

691
00:31:08,919 --> 00:31:14,720
settled yet and as if you folks are

692
00:31:11,558 --> 00:31:16,960
going to move forward remember it's with

693
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:20,159
that with what I just said that means

694
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:21,679
the future is not charted we will make

695
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:24,519
the future that's the great thing about

696
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:27,880
this country those of us in this room

697
00:31:24,519 --> 00:31:29,278
the freedom belongs to the activists and

698
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:33,000
and I would hope that we all know that

699
00:31:29,278 --> 00:31:35,880
we have to be very active in with our

700
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:38,240
with our elected officials and by doing

701
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:41,679
that we will protect the fre our freedom

702
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:44,558
to consume but also just as important

703
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:47,120
the right of people investing now to

704
00:31:44,558 --> 00:31:50,119
make a profit so that they have done the

705
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:52,959
right thing in providing us the Cannabis

706
00:31:50,119 --> 00:31:55,038
that people want to consume for their

707
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:56,919
medical reasons so I don't know if that

708
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:59,839
answered your question but that's what

709
00:31:56,919 --> 00:31:59,840
it was

710
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:08,200
how can our Representatives protect

711
00:32:06,519 --> 00:32:10,480
cannabis stakeholders from federal

712
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:12,759
intervention if local law enforcement

713
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:15,399
can be deputized as federal

714
00:32:12,759 --> 00:32:17,359
agents well you we have to go to the

715
00:32:15,398 --> 00:32:21,119
courts you know the court has to

716
00:32:17,359 --> 00:32:23,918
determine what is the law and uh if you

717
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:26,918
deputize some local person to become a

718
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:28,880
federal agent at that point that person

719
00:32:26,919 --> 00:32:31,360
if if it is the

720
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:33,760
uh for talking about the Department of

721
00:32:31,359 --> 00:32:36,398
Justice at this moment and at least

722
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:37,359
until October of this year and hopefully

723
00:32:36,398 --> 00:32:40,199
we'll get it

724
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:43,439
renewed uh that that person will be

725
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:47,120
breaking the law and uh whether if that

726
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:49,519
person is now on the Fe a federal law

727
00:32:47,119 --> 00:32:53,079
enforcement officer working under the

728
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:56,638
control of the Department of Justice I'm

729
00:32:53,079 --> 00:33:00,278
sorry the courts I have written along

730
00:32:56,638 --> 00:33:04,839
with uh a majority of other members of

731
00:33:00,278 --> 00:33:06,759
Congress written into the law that state

732
00:33:04,839 --> 00:33:08,879
law will be

733
00:33:06,759 --> 00:33:12,200
respected and whether or not they're

734
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:15,799
trying to get around it by uh

735
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:18,278
deputizing a local local law enforcement

736
00:33:15,798 --> 00:33:20,079
or not they still come under the

737
00:33:18,278 --> 00:33:22,119
jurisdiction of the Department of

738
00:33:20,079 --> 00:33:25,199
Justice so I don't think there's any way

739
00:33:22,119 --> 00:33:29,678
they can escape that again however this

740
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:32,278
may be decided in court and and so far

741
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:35,000
uh you know I've had to actually when

742
00:33:32,278 --> 00:33:37,960
we're talking about whether or

743
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:40,839
not these various political figures that

744
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:43,360
we would have hoped would have been more

745
00:33:40,839 --> 00:33:46,959
on our side on this issue whether it's

746
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:49,558
Jerry Brown or or Obama uh I was hoping

747
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:52,679
they would be but we I've had to end up

748
00:33:49,558 --> 00:33:56,720
calling judges I literally have had to

749
00:33:52,679 --> 00:33:58,519
call judges and write judges saying by

750
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:00,120
in the last few years when these people

751
00:33:58,519 --> 00:34:03,440
have been in

752
00:34:00,119 --> 00:34:06,038
power and they U and they actually

753
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:08,838
ignore the fact that we have put this in

754
00:34:06,038 --> 00:34:12,480
a restriction into the Appropriations

755
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:16,320
Bill and I've had to call judges and say

756
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:20,199
look if you have a federal prosecutor in

757
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:22,399
your court today and he is Prosecuting

758
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:23,838
someone who's involved with the medical

759
00:34:22,398 --> 00:34:27,319
use of

760
00:34:23,838 --> 00:34:29,039
marijuana and this state and your state

761
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:31,559
has legalize the medical use of

762
00:34:29,039 --> 00:34:35,480
marijuana there is only one criminal in

763
00:34:31,559 --> 00:34:39,239
your court and that is the the uh guy

764
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:43,679
who is the prosecutor not the defendant

765
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:46,479
and uh so and and quite frankly I

766
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:49,480
remember doing that once and a the

767
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:53,599
federal court of appeals backed me up on

768
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:55,280
that in this particular case so uh we

769
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:57,480
what's the answer the answer is uh they

770
00:34:55,280 --> 00:35:01,560
try to do things like that we'll have to

771
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:03,079
go to the courts and uh as long as we

772
00:35:01,559 --> 00:35:07,000
have this

773
00:35:03,079 --> 00:35:09,920
Coalition between the 68 Republicans who

774
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:12,320
believe in State's rights and the

775
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:14,358
Constitution and the Democrats on the

776
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:16,320
other side of the aisle who by the way I

777
00:35:14,358 --> 00:35:19,639
think are motivated by the fact their

778
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:20,800
political base wants that which is

779
00:35:19,639 --> 00:35:23,078
there's nothing wrong with that in a

780
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:26,119
democracy for go go for your political

781
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:28,599
base so that Coalition is the one who's

782
00:35:26,119 --> 00:35:31,640
writing the law now not the people in

783
00:35:28,599 --> 00:35:34,599
the executive branch their job is to

784
00:35:31,639 --> 00:35:38,519
enforce the law after it's made by the

785
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:41,599
elected representatives so there you

786
00:35:38,519 --> 00:35:43,880
go my uh question is for the congressman

787
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:45,640
there's a lot of talk today about doing

788
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:47,400
research and my group is ready to do

789
00:35:45,639 --> 00:35:49,719
just that we're funding the next four

790
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:52,318
years of the tech neon in Israel's uh

791
00:35:49,719 --> 00:35:54,439
research on cancer and we have a top top

792
00:35:52,318 --> 00:35:56,000
Pediatric Hospital in the country ready

793
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:58,159
to do seven different clinical trials

794
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,960
with us and over a thousand children as

795
00:35:58,159 --> 00:36:01,879
you may know the University of

796
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:04,440
Mississippi Mississippi that has the

797
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:06,920
contract with naida to provide companies

798
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:09,318
like mine with flour is growing what I

799
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:11,200
call Weed it's contaminated it's poor

800
00:36:09,318 --> 00:36:13,039
quality many universities have dropped

801
00:36:11,199 --> 00:36:14,799
out of clinical research it's being

802
00:36:13,039 --> 00:36:16,719
cited on papers that they think their

803
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:18,240
their trials were of poor quality

804
00:36:16,719 --> 00:36:20,838
because of the poor flow that they had

805
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:22,759
to to use what kind of advice can you

806
00:36:20,838 --> 00:36:25,119
give someone like myself and my

807
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:27,319
organization who desperately needs our

808
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:29,838
own DEA grow license none of which have

809
00:36:27,318 --> 00:36:33,159
been handed out yet what can we do in

810
00:36:29,838 --> 00:36:35,759
order to change these regulations or get

811
00:36:33,159 --> 00:36:38,000
a better policy in place so we can get a

812
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:41,160
federal DEA license to grow quality

813
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:43,280
cannabis for dying patients the uh the

814
00:36:41,159 --> 00:36:47,000
great the greatest sin that I think has

815
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:49,119
been committed uh in this whole era of

816
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,719
where people want the government to be

817
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:53,880
the nanny government and take care of

818
00:36:50,719 --> 00:36:56,639
our lives and thus have perpetuated what

819
00:36:53,880 --> 00:37:00,240
I consider to be fascistic controls over

820
00:36:56,639 --> 00:37:02,838
our personal lives Liv the worst effect

821
00:37:00,239 --> 00:37:04,279
of that has been is that we have

822
00:37:02,838 --> 00:37:07,000
basically

823
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:11,280
restricted the knowledge base that we

824
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:13,679
have on this plant this if we learn in

825
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:16,400
the future through opening up and we

826
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:18,318
need to open this up dramatically This

827
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:21,079
research you're right the Mississippi

828
00:37:18,318 --> 00:37:23,199
thing that is a disgrace that is a

829
00:37:21,079 --> 00:37:26,200
National Disgrace that we have left one

830
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:29,039
University with limited amount of of

831
00:37:26,199 --> 00:37:31,799
ability to to look into into this issue

832
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:34,199
uh and if we learn in the future which I

833
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:37,560
believe uh the evidence seems to

834
00:37:34,199 --> 00:37:40,879
indicate that there are some real uses

835
00:37:37,559 --> 00:37:43,719
it's anecdotal now we need to prove that

836
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:45,480
but when that is proven I I think that

837
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:48,719
we need to look back on these people who

838
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:51,519
have ignored uh the potential goodness

839
00:37:48,719 --> 00:37:53,358
of this uh in order to save us from

840
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:55,239
ourselves they're going to save us

841
00:37:53,358 --> 00:37:57,920
wonderful they're going to control our

842
00:37:55,239 --> 00:38:01,358
lives and uh that's what happen happens

843
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:03,480
when anyway I will fight to make sure

844
00:38:01,358 --> 00:38:06,239
that research dollars by the way just

845
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:07,599
let me tell you this I don't people come

846
00:38:06,239 --> 00:38:10,959
to me every

847
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:14,200
day with a disease they want to

848
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:17,720
have that they want to have researched

849
00:38:14,199 --> 00:38:20,318
every day and I say I'm not going to

850
00:38:17,719 --> 00:38:22,358
focus on one

851
00:38:20,318 --> 00:38:26,480
disease I'm not going to do that I'm not

852
00:38:22,358 --> 00:38:28,159
G but I will support increases in the

853
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:30,159
general level

854
00:38:28,159 --> 00:38:31,279
of research in this country which I

855
00:38:30,159 --> 00:38:34,920
always

856
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:38,160
have and I believe that when we look at

857
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:42,480
the general level of research we need to

858
00:38:38,159 --> 00:38:44,879
make sure that that we don't eliminate

859
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:48,480
areas they have some people want us just

860
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:50,480
to focus on their particular problem but

861
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:53,079
when it comes to cannabis we've

862
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:55,480
eliminated an area of honest

863
00:38:53,079 --> 00:38:57,000
investigation so uh you can count on

864
00:38:55,480 --> 00:39:00,679
some of us there there's a lot of people

865
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:03,280
now that are that are aware that I am so

866
00:39:00,679 --> 00:39:05,679
proud that the Israeli government has

867
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:07,960
taken the lead on this but I think at

868
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:10,519
the same time I'm proud of them I'm

869
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:13,559
ashamed of our own government for not

870
00:39:10,519 --> 00:39:16,400
being taking that same stand on open

871
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:17,559
Research into this a long time ago so

872
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:20,160
thank

873
00:39:17,559 --> 00:39:22,480
you okay I just wanted to make one uh

874
00:39:20,159 --> 00:39:25,078
one comment concerning the the schedule

875
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:27,760
one issue and the and the University of

876
00:39:25,079 --> 00:39:30,480
Mississippi um

877
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:33,359
I I know very well uh people at the

878
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:35,639
University of Mississippi I they're very

879
00:39:33,358 --> 00:39:38,679
respectable scientists and everything

880
00:39:35,639 --> 00:39:42,078
the issue is that really uh we can't do

881
00:39:38,679 --> 00:39:44,960
research in the current regulatory

882
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:47,960
scenario that's all I have to say we

883
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:50,318
cannot schedule one seems like a uh the

884
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:52,880
schedule system seems like a reasonable

885
00:39:50,318 --> 00:39:55,838
logical regulatory system it is

886
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:58,000
completely illogical and it's completely

887
00:39:55,838 --> 00:40:01,119
wrong and the only thing that he

888
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:03,679
actually achieves is to really blocking

889
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:06,400
preventing researchers from doing their

890
00:40:03,679 --> 00:40:09,639
job because everybody else who wants to

891
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,639
use it don't really

892
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:18,000
care and I want to reassert again what

893
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:21,119
the doctor just said and I'm sorry

894
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Hillary Clinton wanting to

895
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:26,800
reschedule that means nothing the fact

896
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,719
is it could end up a disaster if there

897
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:31,359
was not schedule the right way it's

898
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:35,159
better if someone says deschedule all

899
00:40:31,358 --> 00:40:38,400
right let's think about that but

900
00:40:35,159 --> 00:40:40,960
uh we could we could we could end up we

901
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:43,119
could end up with a worse situation if

902
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:46,240
it's just rescheduling we literally

903
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:48,720
could end up where there's less research

904
00:40:46,239 --> 00:40:51,000
and there's and that the there's further

905
00:40:48,719 --> 00:40:53,759
controls over each and every one of us

906
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:57,010
here so we got to be very very careful

907
00:40:53,760 --> 00:41:03,119
when we're talking about rescheduling

908
00:40:57,010 --> 00:41:05,560
