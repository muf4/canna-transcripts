1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,120
and inside the bag for the extended

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:09,509
period of time there don't want any of

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:12,710
it to come out for the first cycle 10

4
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:16,109
minutes and 100 degrees second cycles on

5
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:17,760
110 degrees for 10 minutes and you just

6
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:22,500
bump it up by 10 degrees every time

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:28,618
basically so we're just now about to

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:31,890
bump it up to 130 and at this point once

9
00:00:28,618 --> 00:00:36,140
it's at that temperature I'll put a

10
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:41,390
little bit more pressure on it there's a

11
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:44,600
little most likely hold in place now so

12
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:47,820
you'll start to see the bag wet up

13
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:51,840
sometime around the 20 minute mark or so

14
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:53,850
if you got no pressure on it if you see

15
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,760
the bag wet up before that you got too

16
00:00:53,850 --> 00:01:03,109
much pressure on and basically gonna

17
00:00:56,759 --> 00:01:03,108
waste some rosin so now that's my timer

18
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:06,739
reset the timer

19
00:01:14,118 --> 00:01:22,658
so this is actually the 31 minute mark

20
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:22,658
basically we got it at 130 degrees

21
00:01:25,688 --> 00:01:34,359
gently apply some extra pressure I

22
00:01:29,618 --> 00:01:37,879
really like this particular press the

23
00:01:34,359 --> 00:01:40,218
long speak because you can really dial

24
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:48,890
that pressure in your just 1 psi at a

25
00:01:40,218 --> 00:01:58,548
time lock it in place

26
00:01:48,890 --> 00:02:00,368
right there right around 5 psi now you

27
00:01:58,549 --> 00:02:06,679
get in real little tight here for our

28
00:02:00,368 --> 00:02:08,269
extreme close-up we got done you can see

29
00:02:06,679 --> 00:02:14,120
that the bag is just now starting to Wed

30
00:02:08,269 --> 00:02:16,509
up little color a little little wetness

31
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,509
to it

32
00:02:28,209 --> 00:02:38,658
sit there we go extreme close-up extreme

33
00:02:32,628 --> 00:02:41,298
closeup yeah I know that it's good

34
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:44,598
actually zoom in on the part where I'm

35
00:02:41,299 --> 00:02:47,180
trying to get it to the right well you

36
00:02:44,598 --> 00:02:51,369
get the idea it's very much there at

37
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:53,718
this point when is dripping I'll do it

38
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:55,810
you actually want to do and I'm not sure

39
00:02:53,718 --> 00:02:55,810
how

40
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,850
damn okay yeah

41
00:03:08,549 --> 00:03:13,260
Wayne's World Wayne's World

42
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:19,930
okay yeah but it's uh you get it

43
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:25,349
actually see a little bit of moisture on

44
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:25,349
the bag now at this point on the archery

45
00:03:25,408 --> 00:03:32,889
six psi yeah it's still pretty fucking

46
00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:37,599
slow and steady at this point there's

47
00:03:32,889 --> 00:03:42,518
gonna be a lot of a lot of waiting a lot

48
00:03:37,598 --> 00:03:46,060
of thumb twiddling maybe some song and

49
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:47,739
comedy well I honestly I wanted to start

50
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:49,598
up because I think that it is very

51
00:03:47,739 --> 00:03:50,799
interesting and the steps are important

52
00:03:49,598 --> 00:03:52,358
and what you were explaining to me with

53
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:55,780
all really intense so I was like damn I

54
00:03:52,359 --> 00:03:58,950
should play you know I think we pretty

55
00:03:55,780 --> 00:04:01,449
much kind of caught up the most part

56
00:03:58,949 --> 00:04:03,009
it's like the main thing is is just

57
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:05,889
going slow and steady at the beginning

58
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:08,108
because I have went too fast at it

59
00:04:05,889 --> 00:04:12,518
before and the laws and all goopes out

60
00:04:08,109 --> 00:04:14,709
and you know there's still THC a in that

61
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:17,139
rosin that oozed out initially so you

62
00:04:14,709 --> 00:04:20,829
basically didn't harvest the THC a from

63
00:04:17,139 --> 00:04:23,800
that and your first terrine layer will

64
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:29,310
end up being not just terpenes at that

65
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:29,310
point it's well that's a point voice

66
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:37,340
as close up as you can get it apologize

67
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:40,300
for the loud air compressor yeah

68
00:04:37,339 --> 00:04:40,299
whatever

69
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:47,600
those mic here here that we're going to

70
00:04:43,069 --> 00:04:48,969
end up with the best deal that

71
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:54,430
[Music]

72
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:54,430
the overall purity of this resin ranch

73
00:04:55,100 --> 00:05:00,110
there's just not much in the way

74
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:02,839
[Applause]

75
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:04,490
so I'm imagining that the THC percentage

76
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:07,149
of this stuff I don't really know

77
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:10,660
there's no on that sticker there wasn't

78
00:05:07,149 --> 00:05:13,189
no yes there's no way to know but

79
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:18,949
imagining that the rosin is somewhere

80
00:05:13,189 --> 00:05:22,279
over 80 85 % THC and with this method

81
00:05:18,949 --> 00:05:27,228
being as effective as it is you're out

82
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:30,109
really you know losing I have gotten

83
00:05:27,228 --> 00:05:33,949
fairly low THC a yields in the past

84
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:37,400
while using a lower quality rosin

85
00:05:33,949 --> 00:05:40,210
starting product I'm imagining this time

86
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:44,359
we're gonna have somewhere over 50%

87
00:05:40,209 --> 00:05:56,329
that's the hopes so any other weed nerds

88
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:58,970
in there yeah when you actually do start

89
00:05:56,329 --> 00:06:01,908
to put the pressure on you'll get a very

90
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:04,639
clear looking drip coming out of it

91
00:06:01,908 --> 00:06:07,550
that's the terpene fraction there the

92
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:10,879
terpenes are more viscous than the rosin

93
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:13,460
itself so yeah the first thing that

94
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:16,728
you'll actually see is out might end up

95
00:06:13,459 --> 00:06:17,629
being an actual liquid and drop I'm not

96
00:06:16,728 --> 00:06:20,930
sure hmm

97
00:06:17,629 --> 00:06:23,240
it's just like I said it's my first time

98
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:25,310
doing it with this high of a purity so

99
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:27,259
yeah yeah sure what's respect with it

100
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:29,750
but I've seen some shit come out before

101
00:06:27,259 --> 00:06:38,348
that literally just looks like you know

102
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:43,968
nectar okay but yeah the first couple

103
00:06:38,348 --> 00:06:46,519
that come out be like a higher yield of

104
00:06:43,968 --> 00:06:48,889
terpenes that come out and then the ones

105
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:52,639
that come after that will be cleaner but

106
00:06:48,889 --> 00:06:55,639
lower yield and those ones tend to be a

107
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:58,728
little more shatter II well find out

108
00:06:55,639 --> 00:07:01,019
what we're gonna get today pretty much

109
00:06:58,728 --> 00:07:05,459
every product

110
00:07:01,019 --> 00:07:10,198
and end up with a different consistency

111
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:13,620
mmm pan upon you know how it was stored

112
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:16,340
what it was sprayed on it what it

113
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:18,959
experience in his life cycle which and

114
00:07:16,339 --> 00:07:23,179
resident rancher seemed to really

115
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:23,180
optimize his growing environment

116
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:32,550
probably pretty fucking clean oh yeah a

117
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:36,269
lot of times cleaner stuff will be a

118
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:41,879
little more shattering or stable on this

119
00:07:36,269 --> 00:07:44,930
side most okay I'm just bumping up the

120
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:51,029
temperature a little bit higher again

121
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:55,228
140 now you can see that there is a good

122
00:07:51,029 --> 00:07:58,369
corner of moisture formed but nothing's

123
00:07:55,228 --> 00:08:02,728
actually squeezed out of the bag yet

124
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:06,110
we're just at 7 psi now slowly creeping

125
00:08:02,728 --> 00:08:06,109
up oh yeah

126
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:20,579
not really smelling it yet yes yes sir

127
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:23,250
yeah so this is technically mechanical

128
00:08:20,579 --> 00:08:27,169
separation process this is what they

129
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:30,149
call it okay mechanical terpene

130
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:36,889
fractioning or mechanical separation of

131
00:08:30,149 --> 00:08:40,079
th da hmm we're gonna we'll do a little

132
00:08:36,889 --> 00:08:42,840
experimentation with mixing them back

133
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:45,889
together in a form of solvent free

134
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,889
diamonds and sauce

135
00:09:00,029 --> 00:09:09,649
pressure a bit more around ten

136
00:09:07,419 --> 00:09:11,919
well I can see the other side it's got

137
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:11,919
white

138
00:09:18,549 --> 00:09:33,490
so witnesses leaving yeah at this point

139
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:37,450
it's slowly starting to separate the

140
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:42,899
more viscous terpene layer will kind of

141
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:44,830
get pushed away TJ there so that's

142
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:50,889
essentially that's the only thing that's

143
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:53,850
actually coming out of the bag his wax

144
00:09:50,889 --> 00:09:56,379
is a little bit spencer pains they're

145
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:59,409
like to at some point it'd be really

146
00:09:56,379 --> 00:10:02,559
cool to check it out and see like you

147
00:09:59,409 --> 00:10:06,909
know what percentage of THC is left in

148
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:08,829
the terpene fraction and you know

149
00:10:06,909 --> 00:10:11,829
obviously have to find out what the

150
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:15,750
rosin was going in what the turkey

151
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:15,750
fraction was and then what the THC a

152
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:21,419
just to get an idea of how pure of a

153
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:24,578
separation we're actually getting here

154
00:10:21,419 --> 00:10:27,028
mmm oh yeah okay now you can really see

155
00:10:24,578 --> 00:10:27,028
it started

156
00:10:47,698 --> 00:10:58,088
so yeah there's some different ways we

157
00:10:54,129 --> 00:11:01,449
can handle this at the end is uh most of

158
00:10:58,089 --> 00:11:05,110
the stuff I see in the stores mm-hmm has

159
00:11:01,448 --> 00:11:09,729
a pretty pretty dark tinge of yellow to

160
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:11,499
it that means that there's still a

161
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:15,789
little bit of the terpene fraction left

162
00:11:11,499 --> 00:11:18,610
in the thca and the more times you

163
00:11:15,789 --> 00:11:23,198
repress it after we get the separation

164
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:25,990
done we can just keep repressing it full

165
00:11:23,198 --> 00:11:32,769
pressure and full heat hundred eighty

166
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:36,039
degrees and it'll just get cleaner and

167
00:11:32,769 --> 00:11:38,409
cleaner well I had one that I did there

168
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:41,230
just was like perfectly clear crystal

169
00:11:38,409 --> 00:11:45,009
another one I tried I didn't go as hard

170
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:50,920
high and it was still very amber colored

171
00:11:45,009 --> 00:11:52,829
mm so it's up to you how you want to

172
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:55,688
play that I mean obviously you know

173
00:11:52,828 --> 00:12:14,919
weights too much time in this situation

174
00:11:55,688 --> 00:12:16,868
since you already off work well we'll

175
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:21,058
just we'll do it at the what I would

176
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:23,798
consider to be like 75% only done okay

177
00:12:21,058 --> 00:12:25,240
if we keep going at it and keep going at

178
00:12:23,798 --> 00:12:28,178
I mean you could add a whole extra half

179
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:31,379
an hour yeah 40 minutes on total faith

180
00:12:28,178 --> 00:12:33,938
and and it doesn't really change the

181
00:12:31,379 --> 00:12:38,289
purity of that publish oh yeah you

182
00:12:33,938 --> 00:12:40,838
totally honest that's perfect

183
00:12:38,289 --> 00:12:42,189
see the diamonds and kind of mixing it

184
00:12:40,839 --> 00:12:44,790
back into its own rather than any way I

185
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:51,329
want to see I think it would be crazy

186
00:12:44,789 --> 00:12:51,328
cool the way down each time to

187
00:12:51,389 --> 00:12:57,068
separating out there's less in the

188
00:12:54,220 --> 00:13:07,269
terpene or less in the THC a fraction so

189
00:12:57,068 --> 00:13:09,039
right here do you think doesn't work on

190
00:13:07,269 --> 00:13:12,759
a larger scale or would you have to like

191
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:15,659
yeah most definitely would you're

192
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:18,659
wondering to a certain point though I

193
00:13:15,659 --> 00:13:20,439
don't think you could do like a full

194
00:13:18,659 --> 00:13:25,059
plate full of it

195
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:27,790
hmm maybe you can just I feel like you

196
00:13:25,059 --> 00:13:31,059
could end up being a lot more of a mess

197
00:13:27,789 --> 00:13:33,519
because with the viscosity of rosin you

198
00:13:31,059 --> 00:13:36,309
press out a whole plateful it doesn't

199
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:38,379
like this spillover the edges whereas

200
00:13:36,309 --> 00:13:40,439
this stuff if it's really viscous it

201
00:13:38,379 --> 00:13:43,509
could just like drip down into the

202
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:44,620
mm-hmm the inner workings of the press

203
00:13:43,509 --> 00:13:47,350
there mmm

204
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:49,929
that's why some people do the extra

205
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:53,050
parchment folds and get that I mean the

206
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:56,049
directing flow and whatnot right but

207
00:13:53,049 --> 00:13:59,740
I've actually had a lot of bad luck with

208
00:13:56,049 --> 00:14:02,559
those causing the bag to slip around you

209
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:06,370
can't see the bag properly to like tell

210
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:09,028
when it's ready for pressure it makes it

211
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:12,190
way harder for me to not blow out or

212
00:14:09,028 --> 00:14:14,220
shit like that yeah that's all I've kind

213
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:17,829
of stepped away from the directed flow

214
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:20,379
parchment typed okay particularly when

215
00:14:17,828 --> 00:14:25,539
it comes to making actual rosin almost

216
00:14:20,379 --> 00:14:28,929
impossible the low-pressure involved

217
00:14:25,539 --> 00:14:30,909
with this will be more forgiving those

218
00:14:28,929 --> 00:14:33,188
I'm going to be possible to do it

219
00:14:30,909 --> 00:14:34,990
without blowing out yeah but it's really

220
00:14:33,188 --> 00:14:35,469
I mean sometimes it's hard to see what

221
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:37,149
you're doing

222
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:43,569
when you need those directed flow

223
00:14:37,149 --> 00:14:45,909
pouches okay one thing I've had problems

224
00:14:43,568 --> 00:14:48,278
with in the past is I get the flow

225
00:14:45,909 --> 00:14:49,419
proper but then too much of it still

226
00:14:48,278 --> 00:14:51,639
goes out in the back

227
00:14:49,419 --> 00:14:53,129
it causes a pressure buildup back there

228
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:58,269
and that can actually cause the

229
00:14:53,129 --> 00:15:03,279
parchment paper to explode mmm in the on

230
00:14:58,269 --> 00:15:06,460
the backside two more minutes will bump

231
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:09,100
up to 150 degrees and start putting real

232
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:11,530
pressure on this thing okay that's the

233
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:13,840
first big cyclic fold real cycle yeah

234
00:15:11,529 --> 00:15:16,689
that's when it'll start to you might

235
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:18,430
have a few drips pulling out of here and

236
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:23,590
I'm not guaranteeing this stuff is gonna

237
00:15:18,429 --> 00:15:32,079
be super clear mmm we've had some of the

238
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:37,149
past that came out they were like that's

239
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:52,420
a terpene separation right there oh geez

240
00:15:37,149 --> 00:15:55,360
oh you twist the later ones they started

241
00:15:52,419 --> 00:15:59,579
being smaller that's trippy and more

242
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,580
stable mm-hmm that's what these are

243
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:23,709
yeah so basically it's just climbing 150

244
00:16:20,049 --> 00:16:27,809
degrees now once it's there up crank up

245
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:31,629
the pressure until I started see some

246
00:16:27,809 --> 00:16:35,739
action now we're over 40 minutes into it

247
00:16:31,629 --> 00:16:39,458
and the the thta's probably pretty well

248
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:43,568
bonded at this point and not likely to

249
00:16:39,458 --> 00:17:04,509
accidentally use out hmm it's safer to

250
00:16:43,568 --> 00:17:06,970
put pressure on fucked up and I cut this

251
00:17:04,509 --> 00:17:11,220
just a little too short I can't mm-hmm

252
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:11,220
clip it up too damn magnet

253
00:17:27,798 --> 00:17:32,789
move it right up to the edge of the

254
00:17:29,849 --> 00:17:49,109
plate since it's so small and go see

255
00:17:32,789 --> 00:17:51,359
otherwise see how incredibly viscous and

256
00:17:49,109 --> 00:18:04,019
clear that liquid is yeah that's a first

257
00:17:51,359 --> 00:18:08,599
way that's pretty cool you can see it

258
00:18:04,019 --> 00:18:08,599
pretty well on your phone we'd live

259
00:18:10,519 --> 00:18:13,970
literally clear

260
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:18,360
oh I smell it now Oh

261
00:18:18,519 --> 00:18:27,119
oh man that stank

262
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:30,910
mmm really both the garlic and mushrooms

263
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:41,939
and the grandpa house brought the

264
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:41,940
grandpa mouth right out come to call GMO

265
00:18:43,558 --> 00:18:48,700
yeah you didn't miss a whole lot as I

266
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:52,210
was saying earlier jots is a really slow

267
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:56,700
process on this start here but it's

268
00:18:52,210 --> 00:19:00,279
starting to ooze up pretty good now it's

269
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:05,650
just her peens basically right there

270
00:19:00,279 --> 00:19:09,940
I did my job

271
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:13,720
all the thca is still in the bag and

272
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:18,630
that's just the terpene fraction losing

273
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:18,630
out that pure

274
00:19:20,929 --> 00:19:33,330
good the strings you got running the Sun

275
00:19:25,849 --> 00:19:37,189
and job what you running deep purple and

276
00:19:33,329 --> 00:19:39,990
golden goat just I just asked my

277
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:42,000
correctly if I remember correctly and I

278
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:43,710
meant to ask you what what that golden

279
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,730
goat is but if I'm crazy so ministry

280
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:52,190
haven't you heard of that one

281
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:52,190
yeah am i right is that that is Red John

282
00:19:53,960 --> 00:20:00,660
okay gotcha

283
00:19:56,029 --> 00:20:03,089
Oh an IT guy see okay golden girl goes

284
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:04,340
out the purple and raw cookies yes he's

285
00:20:03,089 --> 00:20:07,769
gonna shit

286
00:20:04,339 --> 00:20:11,220
what's up sounds like a nice nice

287
00:20:07,769 --> 00:20:13,740
harvest on your horizon there fuck yeah

288
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:15,690
yeah I remembered because of the golden

289
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:17,099
goat and the deep purple he said I have

290
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:19,650
a great memory I'm not strange but I

291
00:20:17,099 --> 00:20:21,418
happen to remember that but Frank does

292
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:23,790
have a really good memory okay

293
00:20:21,419 --> 00:20:25,559
golden goat that's an interesting one

294
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:26,009
though both of us at some time we never

295
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:31,048
heard of that

296
00:20:26,009 --> 00:20:33,839
that's dream new to me star fans kind of

297
00:20:31,048 --> 00:20:38,639
a plant encyclopedias I was surprised to

298
00:20:33,839 --> 00:21:11,428
hear him say as well unknowable yeah I'm

299
00:20:38,640 --> 00:21:17,509
no plant encyclopedia fuck yeah yeah is

300
00:21:11,429 --> 00:21:20,509
that more on this a teabag Purple's from

301
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:20,509
rip

302
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:36,410
yeah one thing I've grown by him was uh

303
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:41,079
that Apollo 13 law school but I know is

304
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:41,080
there's at least now as well back to

305
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:54,890
well now yeah 150 degrees now we've been

306
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:58,850
doing this for about 45 minutes just now

307
00:21:54,890 --> 00:22:01,070
starting to actually eat out hell yeah

308
00:21:58,849 --> 00:22:03,219
he said yes the steamboat leaving

309
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:09,619
however I remember perfectly 16 - 17

310
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:14,750
Dave finisher nice nice mmm yeah I like

311
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:16,789
those uh pineapple Citybus well some

312
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:19,220
really good pineapple taiwan citizens

313
00:22:16,789 --> 00:22:27,769
fucking bee's knees

314
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:29,600
i have nine exists but yeah this Frank

315
00:22:27,769 --> 00:22:32,000
knows I'm not the biggest fan of three

316
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:37,509
strains but a couple of them every now

317
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:40,369
and then hit right I like those uh

318
00:22:37,509 --> 00:22:46,069
stinky foot you know

319
00:22:40,369 --> 00:22:49,149
burnt rubber diesel fuels like those

320
00:22:46,069 --> 00:22:49,149
things that stink

321
00:22:50,119 --> 00:23:02,479
but yeah you like this GM oh boy uh than

322
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:07,220
ever it's just so funky literally it's

323
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:10,909
like uh uh you know this is the only way

324
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:13,630
to describe it in word I'm pretty sure

325
00:23:10,909 --> 00:23:23,240
that's effectively descriptive of it

326
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:26,140
funk aroma 150 bumpin temps bump intense

327
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:35,298
at this point we're ready to just go

328
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:37,700
blasting away at it with you know it's

329
00:23:35,298 --> 00:23:40,579
not gonna blow up now we're just gonna

330
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:44,169
put the pressure on I'll be back in the

331
00:23:40,579 --> 00:23:44,168
chat in a minute I'm gonna use my camera

332
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:52,490
really brought the grandpa mouth right

333
00:23:47,179 --> 00:24:00,788
out he says all right we are at full

334
00:23:52,490 --> 00:24:00,788
blast at this point

335
00:24:01,269 --> 00:24:06,849
heart rate swap heart metallic case

336
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:16,999
oh boy

337
00:24:21,529 --> 00:24:25,220
and that's just crazy

338
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:36,389
really yeah literally very clear clear

339
00:24:32,599 --> 00:24:38,490
now and that's technically terpene

340
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:41,100
separate right yeah that's just a sure

341
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:44,160
play there should be fairly low in THC

342
00:24:41,099 --> 00:24:46,230
compared to everything else okay I love

343
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:56,310
them kept all the Terps or all the THC a

344
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:58,019
in the in the back school all I can say

345
00:24:56,309 --> 00:25:01,589
if you want to make a good diamond sauce

346
00:24:58,019 --> 00:25:05,220
yeah you mix this back in with that okay

347
00:25:01,589 --> 00:25:07,289
get multiple runs of this after it cool

348
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:09,509
off a little bit you can get hopefully

349
00:25:07,289 --> 00:25:11,430
get it off of the parchment sometimes

350
00:25:09,509 --> 00:25:17,579
they're a little more staffing this one

351
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:20,789
looks like it's probably like so we got

352
00:25:17,579 --> 00:25:22,559
a question from Joe or one one he said

353
00:25:20,789 --> 00:25:29,430
what strain have you guys press that at

354
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:31,500
the best return uh sfv or this GMO

355
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:35,810
honestly this GMOs it's a six star we

356
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:38,670
pressed it had a 77 percent from hash to

357
00:25:35,809 --> 00:25:43,799
rosin but we'll find out what the yield

358
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:50,400
is on rosin ca ca in the past my highest

359
00:25:43,799 --> 00:25:54,240
yield on th EA was I got like twenty

360
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:56,640
percent so it's usually like I get like

361
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:59,549
sixty percent or something fifty percent

362
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:02,490
maybe from hash to rosin and then out of

363
00:25:59,549 --> 00:26:04,409
that you know a 20% of that to go in the

364
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:06,170
form of THC a

365
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:11,460
so that comes out in the form of this

366
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:13,710
goopy stuff on the parchment paper but

367
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:16,670
I'm feeling like this is gonna be a much

368
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:20,039
higher yield because of the actual

369
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:24,330
percentage of THC in the rosin was

370
00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:31,589
higher this probably was 88 90 percent

371
00:26:24,329 --> 00:26:34,319
THC a rosin it's a traditional market

372
00:26:31,589 --> 00:26:39,779
source so there's no testing though on

373
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:43,529
it but it is pure let me tell you that

374
00:26:39,779 --> 00:26:46,829
you know test to its purity there's like

375
00:26:43,529 --> 00:26:50,990
no particles in there they shouldn't be

376
00:26:46,829 --> 00:26:59,899
in there so listen my Jimmy the tool

377
00:26:50,990 --> 00:27:03,920
scraping I call right now it's already

378
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:03,920
still really just doop

379
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:38,308
that's clear oh man that's crazy the jar

380
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:39,870
oh my goodness wow that is a Wow wait at

381
00:27:38,308 --> 00:27:41,639
certain angles you can see that it's

382
00:27:39,869 --> 00:27:42,148
just a little pissed rip of fucking

383
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:44,309
nothing

384
00:27:42,148 --> 00:27:45,268
oh my god yeah right there it's clear

385
00:27:44,308 --> 00:27:47,849
it's a bird

386
00:27:45,269 --> 00:28:07,038
oh my god it looks just like the mouth

387
00:27:47,849 --> 00:28:07,038
it was like attacking this hmm

388
00:28:22,869 --> 00:28:30,709
yeah it's not working off through the

389
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:37,099
paper though it's like way to biscuits

390
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:41,779
to get off the paper don't take yourself

391
00:28:37,099 --> 00:28:44,740
either huh smell that Wow yeah that's

392
00:28:41,779 --> 00:28:44,740
the whole garlic

393
00:29:13,849 --> 00:29:16,959
that's crazy

394
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:27,710
usually like a lot more shattering or at

395
00:29:24,619 --> 00:29:30,049
least of that waxy kind of pliable

396
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:32,630
material or you know you can play with

397
00:29:30,049 --> 00:29:44,839
it kind of hmm this is just straight-up

398
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:47,620
liquid I feel like freeze it so I get it

399
00:29:44,839 --> 00:29:47,619
off that way Oh

400
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:26,548
can't see shit

401
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:30,140
listen now because it's all white it out

402
00:30:26,548 --> 00:30:42,829
yeah that's too close to the light now

403
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:42,830
oh yeah yeah yeah that's crazy yeah

404
00:31:00,548 --> 00:31:06,700
like I'm hanging out at Black Oak branch

405
00:31:08,019 --> 00:31:17,269
and really good bands on the stage and

406
00:31:14,778 --> 00:31:18,950
you know Saturday night people are just

407
00:31:17,269 --> 00:31:26,538
doing all that Saturday night stuff that

408
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:29,048
they do like over here then the band

409
00:31:26,538 --> 00:31:32,240
says something about yeah it smells like

410
00:31:29,048 --> 00:31:36,048
somebody's cooking popcorn out there in

411
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:42,649
the crowd sure would like to smoke some

412
00:31:36,048 --> 00:31:44,950
pot I mean eat some popcorn this

413
00:31:42,648 --> 00:31:47,089
security guard comes over and he's like

414
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:50,569
dance we could smell popcorn

415
00:31:47,089 --> 00:31:52,638
oh okay everybody all right fuck yeah

416
00:31:50,569 --> 00:31:54,798
security guard enjoy some popcorn and

417
00:31:52,638 --> 00:31:59,619
then Karen comes over she's like y'all

418
00:31:54,798 --> 00:31:59,619
can't do that here this is Kate Wolfe

419
00:32:08,549 --> 00:32:11,549
teach

420
00:32:24,099 --> 00:32:29,219
I mean that happened to a friend of mine

421
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:13,379
golly so it's still part thing - mmm

422
00:33:10,339 --> 00:33:15,209
yeah uh we'll get a little bit more

423
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:19,610
Terps next time or I mean sorry a little

424
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:19,610
bit less turps each time after this now

425
00:33:22,339 --> 00:33:27,439
ya know how well we're gonna be able to

426
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:29,580
do this song that was dining this also

427
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:32,279
well pretty much what I thought

428
00:33:29,579 --> 00:33:34,740
we're getting more in the form of THC a

429
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:36,329
in them sauce what I was thinking

430
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:38,849
originally also is like I don't know

431
00:33:36,329 --> 00:33:41,309
what the room is from them but it's like

432
00:33:38,849 --> 00:33:43,919
it looks like it's like whipped rosin

433
00:33:41,309 --> 00:33:48,119
that just has the diamonds in it I think

434
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:51,960
I think it's really rosin it's it's a

435
00:33:48,119 --> 00:33:55,379
probably a proportion of terpenes rosin

436
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:59,490
to th EI and then whipped while heated

437
00:33:55,380 --> 00:34:02,730
oh Jesus and then the Diamonds added

438
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:05,250
after ours she's hard to say so yeah the

439
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:09,449
proprietary tech is their own method

440
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:11,400
it's hard to recreate but they're the I

441
00:34:09,449 --> 00:34:16,939
feel like it's some form of those

442
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:24,030
combinations of things heat whip

443
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:27,450
proportions of ingredients okay so now

444
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:31,880
we're doing full pressure full heat

445
00:34:27,449 --> 00:34:31,879
which is a hundred and seventy

446
00:34:38,139 --> 00:34:49,119
there's allegedly happened other cables

447
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:53,710
allegedly ladies unless you'd leave the

448
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:53,710
glove did not fit what's the quick

449
00:34:57,608 --> 00:35:01,808
actually I will do another

450
00:35:17,349 --> 00:35:23,960
did not have inhalation relations with

451
00:35:21,099 --> 00:35:26,909
that woman miss Merrow in ski

452

[Music]

453
00:35:26,909 --> 00:35:29,869
I'm getting my night and scandals all

454
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:33,510
mixed up hold on

455
00:35:29,869 --> 00:35:33,509

456
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,900

[Music]

461
00:35:58,469 --> 00:36:04,259
like the only thing

462
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:04,260
straight up

463
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:16,170
the parchment actually it's angled so it

464
00:36:10,199 --> 00:36:18,929
kind of pulls up all right now at this

465
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:21,420
point it's just cleaning up we'll just

466
00:36:18,929 --> 00:36:25,199
do this one more round and we'll call it

467
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:31,670
at that point okay that would be a hour

468
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:31,669
and 10 minutes cool yeah and then I

469
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:42,420
think we're just now had an hour in 10

470
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:49,440
minutes actually since it's 5:14 we

471
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:52,320
started at 4 right you know yeah so yeah

472
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:54,570
any any bit of time from here now isn't

473
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:57,090
really gonna do much else except for

474
00:36:54,570 --> 00:37:09,900
just change the color of the TCA a

475
00:36:57,090 --> 00:37:11,820
little bit it's why it gets lighter so

476
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:14,760
like I said right now there's still some

477
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:16,980
terpenes stuck inside the bag mm-hmm and

478
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:18,960
slowly over time you're gonna push all

479
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:22,590
of those out and then you'll just end up

480
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:23,880
with a purer and purer the8 I meant I

481
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:25,200
guess is that terpenes come out of

482
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:26,070
darker as you're gone oh no they

483
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:29,069
actually get lighter too

484
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:31,080
Oh crazy yeah it's okay in my experience

485
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:36,420
it's just like less of it each time but

486
00:37:31,079 --> 00:37:37,829
it didn't like clear so that little bit

487
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:42,240
of color that is there isn't gonna be

488
00:37:37,829 --> 00:37:43,920
there that's for me okay but yeah it's

489
00:37:42,239 --> 00:37:47,489
probably not even gonna be enough to

490
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:49,769
actually collect it's just pushing it a

491
00:37:47,489 --> 00:37:52,259
little bit further out of the inner bag

492
00:37:49,769 --> 00:37:53,929
into the second bag at this point then

493
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:57,960
sometimes what I'll do is I'll actually

494
00:37:53,929 --> 00:37:59,639
pull apart and collect it all the THC

495
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:01,710
out of there and put it in a clean bag

496
00:37:59,639 --> 00:38:04,589
and then repress it again at this point

497
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:06,599
and that gets like at this point the bag

498
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:09,480
is just being a sponge pulling extra

499
00:38:06,599 --> 00:38:11,309
Terps out of it that would be in the

500
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:15,929
ga mm-hmm that's how you end up with the

501
00:38:11,309 --> 00:38:17,759
clearest most pure crystals well we

502
00:38:15,929 --> 00:38:22,069
don't have to go that far into it I'm

503
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:22,070
sure it's just so he's stupid as is mmm

504
00:38:53,920 --> 00:39:01,079
and for the sake of brevity let's just

505
00:38:57,099 --> 00:39:01,079
call it now in the middle of the cycle

506
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:14,200
you see this like I mean basically

507
00:39:09,849 --> 00:39:17,318
nothing yeah but each time you do that

508
00:39:14,199 --> 00:39:18,818
it's just a little bit comes out of

509
00:39:17,318 --> 00:39:25,630
there it would be in here

510
00:39:18,818 --> 00:39:28,298
Oh guys I think so now this is the goods

511
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:35,890
it's the goods you're right back in the

512
00:39:28,298 --> 00:39:38,019
chat I'm gonna be videotaping it so like

513
00:39:35,889 --> 00:39:40,179
I said it's like a sponge almost of

514
00:39:38,019 --> 00:39:43,329
sorts it's it's soaking up the turkeys

515
00:39:40,179 --> 00:39:46,750
at this point okay home amount of the

516
00:39:43,329 --> 00:39:49,019
inner bag in the bag will be a lot

517
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:49,019
cleaner

518
00:39:49,559 --> 00:39:52,639
[Music]

519
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:04,889
Oh busted out just a little bit Wow

520
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:07,169
that's crazy-looking no dude this is

521
00:40:04,889 --> 00:40:10,889
already pure white at this point it's

522
00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:16,200
already like oh my god here oh my

523
00:40:10,889 --> 00:40:17,848
goodness dude so we're back from

524
00:40:16,199 --> 00:40:24,149
Colombia with our goods

525
00:40:17,849 --> 00:40:24,660
oh that's crazy-looking that's pretty

526
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:28,970
nuts

527
00:40:24,659 --> 00:40:28,969
looks like the absolute

528
00:40:36,619 --> 00:40:41,469
[Music]

529
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:20,969
all right I got the parchment tear it

530
00:41:18,179 --> 00:42:00,329
out you can figure out how much we

531
00:41:20,969 --> 00:42:20,129
actually harvest it here now that it's

532
00:42:00,329 --> 00:42:25,190
on a brown paper he can see it better so

533
00:42:20,130 --> 00:42:30,750
yeah almost exactly 50% it's probably

534
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:33,110
more accurate way of it ma'am 147 yeah

535
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:33,110
that's great

536
00:42:40,579 --> 00:42:52,670
point four seven always one grand it is

537
00:42:50,469 --> 00:42:56,480
really good

538
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:59,090
I couldn't maybe not went as hard on it

539
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:02,949
and could have Lily over 50% me just

540
00:42:59,090 --> 00:43:02,950
have to slice it yell okay Oh

541
00:43:09,570 --> 00:43:12,899
[Music]

542
00:43:16,090 --> 00:43:19,280
[Music]

543
00:43:21,409 --> 00:43:29,509
just heat the press up to 190 degrees

544
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:32,570
and just let it sit there slowly over

545
00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:34,640
time it'll get there but it's for Holi

546
00:43:32,570 --> 00:43:36,950
actually have that was off I had no idea

547
00:43:34,639 --> 00:43:37,309
so I just found that we can do it that

548
00:43:36,949 --> 00:43:40,629
way

549
00:43:37,309 --> 00:43:40,630
now here's the cool thing

550
00:43:49,108 --> 00:43:59,858
if this was a little bit of light - Wow

551
00:43:57,548 --> 00:44:13,989
no it's badass so here's the coolest

552
00:43:59,858 --> 00:44:17,498
part about it is this is this is the is

553
00:44:13,989 --> 00:44:22,150
the most stable THC substance I've ever

554
00:44:17,498 --> 00:44:25,149
played with my life at this point once

555
00:44:22,150 --> 00:44:29,159
it's solidified into this crystal just

556
00:44:25,150 --> 00:44:33,009
whatever glassy type deal it takes over

557
00:44:29,159 --> 00:44:34,390
200 degrees to reheat it so I could

558
00:44:33,009 --> 00:44:35,469
literally just sit there and hold it my

559
00:44:34,389 --> 00:44:37,568
hands forever

560
00:44:35,469 --> 00:44:41,139
it'll never melt to my finger at all

561
00:44:37,568 --> 00:44:44,998
even without gloves on this is the most

562
00:44:41,139 --> 00:44:44,998
stable THC product I've ever seen

563
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:05,619
can you go grab those um other turf

564
00:45:02,889 --> 00:45:09,029
players so fast yeah we're under the

565
00:45:05,619 --> 00:45:18,670
freezer I don't have to breathe yeah hi

566
00:45:09,030 --> 00:45:21,400
fuck yeah oh yeah do you know this year

567
00:45:18,670 --> 00:45:23,889
still got some THC left in it it's hard

568
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:26,289
to get it all out but what I generally

569
00:45:23,889 --> 00:45:30,519
do with that is just like throw it into

570
00:45:26,289 --> 00:45:39,909
a little bit of tea you know at the hot

571
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:55,449
tea so I end up with like a little bit

572
00:45:39,909 --> 00:45:57,789
left on there so we'll play around with

573
00:45:55,449 --> 00:46:01,029
that and make them mix up and stuff and

574
00:45:57,789 --> 00:46:03,090
then we'll smoke it later tomorrow or
