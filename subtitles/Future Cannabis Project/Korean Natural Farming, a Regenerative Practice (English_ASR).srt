1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,830
Kurian natural farming a regenerative

2
00:00:02,759 --> 00:00:06,528
practice I'm Christina Trout of Lala

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:10,050
Gardens

4
00:00:06,528 --> 00:00:12,000
first there was thistle to understand

5
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:13,969
thistle I need to tell you about a

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,448
reoccurring dream I had as a child

7
00:00:13,968 --> 00:00:20,219
involving a centipede weirdly the scene

8
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:22,740
of the crime was in a white bathroom in

9
00:00:20,219 --> 00:00:25,049
a white bathtub in my attempts to kill

10
00:00:22,739 --> 00:00:27,118
the centipede it break into half and

11
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:28,859
grow and those halves would break into

12
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:32,988
halves and grow until the bathroom was

13
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:35,600
literally full of centipedes terrifying

14
00:00:32,988 --> 00:00:38,039
this is how I've used this'll this'll

15
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,600
arrived after I done everything on my

16
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:40,378
property I thought a good permaculture

17
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,539
should do

18
00:00:40,378 --> 00:00:43,890
I'd already tilled too late for

19
00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:46,049
preserving the existing fungal

20
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:47,579
communities in this soil but I knew

21
00:00:46,049 --> 00:00:49,558
enough by the end of my training that if

22
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:52,378
I could keep the soil covered that

23
00:00:49,558 --> 00:00:54,718
diversity would return so I got to work

24
00:00:52,378 --> 00:00:57,119
building layers of cardboard woodchips

25
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:00,179
leaves not to mention the literal dump

26
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:03,109
truck loads of composted manure why did

27
00:01:00,179 --> 00:01:07,319
I feel like I needed to do all of this I

28
00:01:03,109 --> 00:01:09,390
have rock-hard clay soils the most used

29
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:11,908
tool in my bucket of garden tools is an

30
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:13,710
ice pick more than a decade later

31
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:16,609
I have soils that are still prone to

32
00:01:13,709 --> 00:01:19,438
compaction but there are clumps now

33
00:01:16,609 --> 00:01:21,688
aggregates with clay and organic matter

34
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:23,758
riddled with worm tunnels and I can grow

35
00:01:21,688 --> 00:01:27,478
a lot of things I couldn't then so

36
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:29,188
success and then that this'll fast in

37
00:01:27,478 --> 00:01:31,409
succession after the bindweed

38
00:01:29,188 --> 00:01:33,209
I created a haven for these unruly

39
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:36,180
misfits who moved in quickly and with

40
00:01:33,209 --> 00:01:39,289
great determination we're well versed in

41
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:41,670
the problems of these invasive cousins

42
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:44,640
what happens when we try to chop or

43
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:48,390
poison thistle it splits into two three

44
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:50,219
four and each surviving piece starts to

45
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:54,000
grow more vigorously than had you left

46
00:01:50,219 --> 00:01:55,920
it alone chemical solutions seem the

47
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,109
only option for meeting the challenges

48
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,149
of these successional plants whose sole

49
00:01:58,109 --> 00:02:03,030
duty is to populate and return to the

50
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:05,180
earth in mass in an attempt to heal the

51
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:09,270
original damage done from disruption

52
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:10,739
including tilling I also knew enough to

53
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:13,159
recognize that with so much effort

54
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:15,890
applied in creating an environment of

55
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:18,590
would love they simply were not showing

56
00:02:15,889 --> 00:02:20,509
up even over a period of time bringing

57
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:22,280
spore back from my mushroom hunts and

58
00:02:20,509 --> 00:02:25,340
dispersing it into the microclimates I'd

59
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:27,379
created specifically for them I'd get an

60
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:30,800
occasional burst of chip loving species

61
00:02:27,379 --> 00:02:34,129
a few puff balls but what thrived in my

62
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:36,530
soils were mustards and lettuces

63
00:02:34,129 --> 00:02:38,840
radicchio and brassicas what do these

64
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:41,270
species have in common their bacterial

65
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:43,310
loving species I had created bacterial

66
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:45,080
dominant nitrogen rich soils and was

67
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:47,180
helping succession happen in a big way

68
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:48,950
because successional plans like ragweed

69
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:53,210
and thistle love bacterial dominant

70
00:02:48,949 --> 00:02:54,769
soils succession happens rather than

71
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:57,980
seeing this is a natural law to be

72
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:59,360
respected and encouraged agricultural

73
00:02:57,979 --> 00:03:01,369
science backed products and practices

74
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,920
have us attempting to halt a reverse

75
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:05,770
succession of the fixity attitude soils

76
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:09,439
are to be amended and weeds controlled

77
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:11,450
succession happens from bacterial to

78
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:13,099
fungal dominance it's Naturals way of

79
00:03:11,449 --> 00:03:14,799
self-correcting building soils to

80
00:03:13,099 --> 00:03:19,849
support even more evolving complex

81
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:21,860
ecosystems fungal dominant soils perform

82
00:03:19,849 --> 00:03:24,129
in amazing ways including water

83
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:27,260
retention disruption of pathogens

84
00:03:24,129 --> 00:03:29,150
absorption of toxins pH balancing

85
00:03:27,259 --> 00:03:31,639
providing plants with a network of

86
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:33,140
nutrients eking populations whose sole

87
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:36,739
function is to provide plants with

88
00:03:33,139 --> 00:03:38,329
everything that plant asks for fungal

89
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:40,370
dominant soils are literally the

90
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:42,080
probiotic for the soil and direct

91
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:44,270
relationship with the probiotics within

92
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,340
our own bodies the very ones which

93
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:49,159
secure our longevity youthfulness and

94
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:52,489
vitality without probiotics we can't

95
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:57,400
derive the nutrients we need we are

96
00:03:52,489 --> 00:04:00,560
plants and plants are us without legs

97
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:03,080
without mobility plants have evolved

98
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,699
within their micro regions to work with

99
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:07,790
the microorganisms in the soil to

100
00:04:04,699 --> 00:04:10,549
provide all it needs the micro organisms

101
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:12,919
in turn derive their nutrients from clay

102
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:16,299
and rock the dance of soil building

103
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:18,709
between plant and microbe problem is

104
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:20,120
we've been taught as cultivators to

105
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:23,649
treat the plant rather than the

106
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:23,649
conditions under which it is grown

107
00:04:23,779 --> 00:04:28,339
to stave off problems we front-load our

108
00:04:26,569 --> 00:04:30,379
soils with everything we think a plant

109
00:04:28,339 --> 00:04:32,719
needs over its lifecycle rather than

110
00:04:30,379 --> 00:04:34,550
equip it with avenues to find what it

111
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,560
needs through relationships with the

112
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:38,449
indigenous life in the soil even

113
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,310
disrupting the soils in order to give

114
00:04:38,449 --> 00:04:43,189
the plant a head start and it's supposed

115
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:45,319
battle with nature we anticipate what

116
00:04:43,189 --> 00:04:48,350
needs to be fixed in an unbalanced

117
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:51,469
system I had no idea how to fix my

118
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:55,160
thistle problem I decided to do nothing

119
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:57,020
literally I quit spraying I encouraged

120
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,970
the plants which decided to stay

121
00:04:57,019 --> 00:05:00,799
clipped seed heads of those I didn't

122
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:02,750
want and said in a course of

123
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:06,500
naturalizing without understanding what

124
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:08,689
or could happen I first learned about

125
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:10,459
Korean natural farming or KNF as it

126
00:05:08,689 --> 00:05:12,560
became first practiced in small circles

127
00:05:10,459 --> 00:05:14,959
of cannabis growers in California in the

128
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,530
Pacific Northwest who raved about KNF

129
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:21,199
living soils and amazing results and

130
00:05:17,529 --> 00:05:23,509
down the rabbit hole I went I didn't

131
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,668
follow directions I came at it with a

132
00:05:23,509 --> 00:05:28,310
fixed attitude endless ideas for how to

133
00:05:25,668 --> 00:05:31,129
improve the system having experimented

134
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:32,449
with fermentation and derivations I

135
00:05:31,129 --> 00:05:33,860
thought I understood what I was

136
00:05:32,449 --> 00:05:37,579
gathering from the misinformation

137
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:40,038
prevalent online I made huge mistakes

138
00:05:37,579 --> 00:05:41,659
and yet the cannabis I grew was of such

139
00:05:40,038 --> 00:05:43,939
an extraordinary quality that I knew I

140
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:45,590
had to learn the system I couldn't

141
00:05:43,939 --> 00:05:47,600
believe the qualitative difference and

142
00:05:45,589 --> 00:05:49,969
not only flavor terpene expression but

143
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,560
in medicinal quality It was as if the

144
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:53,840
plant was expressing a part of herself

145
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:55,759
that hadn't been possible before

146
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:58,250
introducing even a fraction of diversity

147
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:00,769
that would later prove to me the power

148
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:03,949
of indigenous microorganisms true to

149
00:06:00,769 --> 00:06:05,689
place in time I first learned the

150
00:06:03,949 --> 00:06:07,610
fundamentals of Korean natural farming

151
00:06:05,689 --> 00:06:09,889
from Chris Trump whose family owns an

152
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:11,330
800-acre macadamia farm in Hawaii where

153
00:06:09,889 --> 00:06:14,959
his practice of natural farming

154
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:17,269
literally saved their farm Chris learned

155
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:20,839
directly from master Chao making the

156
00:06:17,269 --> 00:06:23,329
trek to Korea 11 times in 2011 Chris and

157
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:27,139
his family applied KNF to a few trees

158
00:06:23,329 --> 00:06:28,849
moving to a 50 acre trial of trees where

159
00:06:27,139 --> 00:06:31,639
finally his family farm is now a hundred

160
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:34,070
percent K&amp;F and thriving chris teaches

161
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:35,478
all over the world and there's no end to

162
00:06:34,069 --> 00:06:37,490
the benefit of learning this teaching

163
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:39,620
hands-on

164
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:41,509
Master Choa who began practicing natural

165
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:42,829
farming in the 60s devoted his life to

166
00:06:41,509 --> 00:06:44,449
teaching even though he faced

167
00:06:42,829 --> 00:06:46,490
persecution from chemical company

168
00:06:44,449 --> 00:06:49,370
lobbyists and government officials for

169
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:51,348
his teaching in practice Master Choa in

170
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:53,959
turn recognizes three teachers from his

171
00:06:51,348 --> 00:06:56,149
early visits to Japan one taught him

172
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:58,339
respect for all life from another he

173
00:06:56,149 --> 00:07:01,418
learned about enzymes and indigenous

174
00:06:58,339 --> 00:07:04,698
microorganisms or IMO his third teacher

175
00:07:01,418 --> 00:07:08,779
may who made the first kyoho cultivars

176
00:07:04,699 --> 00:07:11,180
in Japan which are grapes the size of a

177
00:07:08,779 --> 00:07:13,129
baby's fist teaching show the nutritive

178
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:15,650
cycle of plants and the importance of

179
00:07:13,129 --> 00:07:17,149
observing natural law what is some a

180
00:07:15,649 --> 00:07:19,489
revolutionary about master chose life

181
00:07:17,149 --> 00:07:23,959
work in Korean natural farming is that

182
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:27,110
it works it works in any environment at

183
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:29,719
any time using the plants found thriving

184
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:31,340
in your area it teaches one to speak the

185
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:33,199
language of plants through simple

186
00:07:31,339 --> 00:07:36,560
observation of the plants nutritive

187
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:38,629
cycle much like a human cycle doctor

188
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,360
chose simple technology is a sane

189
00:07:38,629 --> 00:07:44,019
response to conventional agriculture

190
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:46,598
which is ecologically not sustainable

191
00:07:44,019 --> 00:07:50,629
economically also not viable and

192
00:07:46,598 --> 00:07:52,310
environmentally ruinous plant sciences

193
00:07:50,629 --> 00:07:54,110
practice now is more concerned with

194
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:57,199
unlocking the secrets of how things work

195
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:58,490
in an effort to fix a broken system then

196
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,740
on observation of how life actually

197
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:03,800
works to not only self correct but

198
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:05,538
thrive industrial agriculture backed by

199
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:07,280
plant science views natural systems

200
00:08:05,538 --> 00:08:09,529
through the same inherited fix-it lens

201
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:12,109
and it teaches us to do the same

202
00:08:09,529 --> 00:08:14,388
a fixit's inori applied to my problem

203
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:16,788
clay soils required all my fix-it

204
00:08:14,389 --> 00:08:18,918
approaches ultimately defeating me I was

205
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:21,918
left hacking thistle in soil with an ice

206
00:08:18,918 --> 00:08:23,930
pick with no perceivable end in fact

207
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:25,758
that thistle was filling the spaces I

208
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:27,879
was spraying with roundup even though I

209
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:32,149
was fully aware of the implications

210
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:34,370
helpless a crisis of imagination with

211
00:08:32,149 --> 00:08:37,940
nature's imbalances too big a problem to

212
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:39,649
fix it took me a year after Chris's

213
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:40,250
class to begin practice in my outdoor

214
00:08:39,649 --> 00:08:43,219
gardens

215
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:44,958
I made the applications and continued to

216
00:08:43,219 --> 00:08:47,089
apply them in my indoor smaller garden

217
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:49,639
gaining confidence in my skills of

218
00:08:47,089 --> 00:08:50,910
making and applying applications I was

219
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:52,439
still entertaining the fix-it

220
00:08:50,909 --> 00:08:54,600
tality subtly thinking of ways to

221
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:58,140
improve the system coming to terms with

222
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:59,670
my rebellious nature the paradigm shift

223
00:08:58,139 --> 00:09:02,179
occurred with my first successful

224
00:08:59,669 --> 00:09:07,500
harvest of indigenous micro organisms

225
00:09:02,179 --> 00:09:10,079
building a box making the rice choosing

226
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:12,389
a spot 500 feet in elevation above but

227
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,970
within my microclimate that's fungal and

228
00:09:12,389 --> 00:09:17,669
lush planting the rice field box in

229
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:19,410
place for seven days or so returning and

230
00:09:17,669 --> 00:09:21,149
unwrapping the gift of that place and

231
00:09:19,409 --> 00:09:23,610
such a fuzzy display of diversity

232
00:09:21,149 --> 00:09:27,529
filling my nose with the aroma of a

233
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:30,240
primordial forest floor intoxicating

234
00:09:27,529 --> 00:09:32,759
what natural farming requires is a

235
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,860
willingness to practice in order to see

236
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:37,319
in order to come into a greater

237
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:39,230
understanding of how nature works and to

238
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:43,080
trust the process

239
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:46,680
natural farming requires us to view

240
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:48,570
nature as perfect not as a static thing

241
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:50,699
but is a perfect working system of

242
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:53,580
balancing it requires us to become

243
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:55,710
citizen scientist basing our findings on

244
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:58,530
side-by-side trials in order to observe

245
00:09:55,710 --> 00:10:00,540
the outcomes of our practices learn

246
00:09:58,529 --> 00:10:02,850
exactly how our inputs of supporting the

247
00:10:00,539 --> 00:10:05,909
natural system and a plant's drive to

248
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:11,040
express its genetic potential we learn

249
00:10:05,909 --> 00:10:12,600
to talk to plants our education

250
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:14,849
concerning the growth of plants must

251
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:18,420
include the awareness that a plant has

252
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:20,639
everything it needs to thrive in concert

253
00:10:18,419 --> 00:10:24,599
with indigenous micro organisms plants

254
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:27,629
have the capacity to build soil from

255
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:29,460
rock in healthy fungal balanced soil

256
00:10:27,629 --> 00:10:32,309
plants an expression of true health and

257
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:34,820
vitality signaled to us an ecosystem in

258
00:10:32,309 --> 00:10:37,139
a state of regenerative abundance

259
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:39,150
regenerative is not isolating plant

260
00:10:37,139 --> 00:10:42,870
compounds as weapons against insects

261
00:10:39,149 --> 00:10:45,509
viruses or pathogens regenerative is not

262
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:49,560
bugs in a jug microbes isolated and

263
00:10:45,509 --> 00:10:53,279
grown at a lab nor microbes brought from

264
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:58,139
far-off places it is not plastic mulch

265
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:59,250
it is not tilling regenerative systems

266
00:10:58,139 --> 00:11:02,939
are discovered through simple

267
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:04,528
observational skills regenerative

268
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:06,720
systems restore our Kapow

269
00:11:04,528 --> 00:11:09,448
city for wonder for imagination for

270
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:13,199
discovery so what is the practice of

271
00:11:09,448 --> 00:11:15,120
natural farming at the heart of natural

272
00:11:13,198 --> 00:11:16,828
farming lies a process of cultivating

273
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,379
indigenous micro organisms through a

274
00:11:16,828 --> 00:11:21,558
simple but precise method of harvesting

275
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:23,579
without disruption of any ecosystem

276
00:11:21,558 --> 00:11:25,198
introducing this diversity into our

277
00:11:23,578 --> 00:11:27,388
disrupted soils where it comes into

278
00:11:25,198 --> 00:11:31,139
balance with what's there building and

279
00:11:27,389 --> 00:11:33,269
restoring a robust biodiversity at the

280
00:11:31,139 --> 00:11:35,159
same time that these IMO populations are

281
00:11:33,269 --> 00:11:37,019
being introduced other applications are

282
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:39,539
applied to our cultivated plants through

283
00:11:37,019 --> 00:11:41,370
foliar or soil drenches which directly

284
00:11:39,539 --> 00:11:44,789
support a plant's communication with

285
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:46,528
this environment there are various

286
00:11:44,789 --> 00:11:47,938
applications derived from plant

287
00:11:46,528 --> 00:11:50,759
materials which will populate your

288
00:11:47,938 --> 00:11:52,318
shelves a library of applications needed

289
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:54,360
over the course of a growing season

290
00:11:52,318 --> 00:11:57,870
according to the nutritive cycle of the

291
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:59,610
plant natural farming in essence is the

292
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:01,438
application of the right material the

293
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:03,870
right amount at the right time it is

294
00:12:01,438 --> 00:12:05,639
simple but specific these applications

295
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:07,169
are applied at ratios one to a thousand

296
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:10,079
or one to five hundred or one to three

hundred Zara homeopathic in nature so

298
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:13,049
while the gathering of materials

299
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:14,970
requires attention throughout the season

300
00:12:13,049 --> 00:12:16,500
a small amount of the applications

301
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:20,250
you've gathered go a long way in a

relatively free and cost natural farming

303
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:24,269
is effective in any place any climate

304
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:26,850
any condition and by its simplicity of

00:12:35,938 --> 00:12:39,958
plant-based applications

311
00:12:37,438 --> 00:12:42,149
side-by-side trials are incorporated as

312
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:44,399
a means to observe directly how varying

313
00:12:42,149 --> 00:12:46,528
applications work to increase vitality

314
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:49,528
and to enhance whole system functioning

315
00:12:46,528 --> 00:12:51,240
if science is more inclusive of an

316

data through these simple side-by-side

319
00:12:55,948 --> 00:13:01,740
trials then we could chart through

320
00:12:57,948 --> 00:13:04,318
observation in what ways nature is a

321
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:06,178
perfect system and much more efficient

322
00:13:04,318 --> 00:13:08,099
it's solving the same problems we were

323
00:13:06,178 --> 00:13:10,799
trying to solve through derivative based

324
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:14,290
fix-it solutions namely food security

325
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:17,120
and a thriving ecosystem

326
00:13:14,289 --> 00:13:18,528
rather than unlocking secrets if our

327
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,440
attention as a scientific and academic

328
00:13:18,528 --> 00:13:23,689
community were on understanding the

00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:50,570
approach growth tips of plants are

339
00:13:48,528 --> 00:13:53,208
populated with undifferentiated cells

340
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:55,790
these cells are potent with possibility

341
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:57,588
in response to a host of environmental

342
00:13:55,789 --> 00:14:00,319
conditions these cells can literally

343
00:13:57,589 --> 00:14:02,390
literally do and become anything all the

344
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,820
materials required to present including

345
00:14:02,389 --> 00:14:07,580
hormones and enzymes necessary for

346
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:09,140
growth it's these compounds were drawing

347
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:11,570
out with the sugar which has a drawing

348
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:13,129
effect much like salt this will is one

349
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:15,589
of the plants I now harvest for this

350
00:14:13,129 --> 00:14:18,139
application its growth pattern is

351
00:14:15,589 --> 00:14:21,080
unmatched the mineral content impressive

352
00:14:18,139 --> 00:14:23,870
- its medicine for parasites and humans

353
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:25,459
and anti pathogenic in nature by

354
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:26,720
increasing the vigor and growth of my

355
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:29,208
hemp this year in part through the

356
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:31,100
application of thistle I was able to use

357
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:34,250
my hemp crop to control the understory

358
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:36,080
of this will from emerging it's still

359
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:38,120
present but I'm no longer cutting it in

360
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:40,370
an attempt to kill it it's become an

361
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:42,139
indicator of soil health and a marker of

362
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:45,950
the successional state of my garden I

363
00:14:42,139 --> 00:14:48,649
know to mulch and inoculate to harvest

364
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:53,350
and respect through deep appreciation

365
00:14:48,649 --> 00:14:53,350
what nature is trying to show me

366
00:14:58,019 --> 00:15:00,078
you
