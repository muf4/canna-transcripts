2
00:00:12,439 --> 00:00:18,809
today my senior talk there was a point

3
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:22,350
where you started to introduce pricing

4
00:00:18,809 --> 00:00:24,659
as a new component to this data set what

5
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:27,510
what are the prospects of outlooks for

6
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:29,759
data in that space you're a chemist

7
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:31,560
you're back have you done anything with

8
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,200
financial time series regressions I have

9
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:38,039
not so financial time series regression

10
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:42,000
in a basic linear regression we say that

11
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:43,589
a conditioned variable is you know the

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,359
dependent variable is conditioned on the

13
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:48,030
independent variable and there's some

14
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:48,750
usually linear coefficient if you think

15
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:50,070
about how they would work with a

16
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:52,259
financial time series what you'd be

17
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:54,840
saying is that the price is equal to

18
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:56,939
some coefficient times time that means

19
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,699
the price would be a straight line going

20
00:00:56,939 --> 00:01:02,250
some way up hopefully maybe down who

21
00:00:59,698 --> 00:01:04,709
knows that's obviously not our prices

22
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:06,599
work in the real world a slightly more

23
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:09,149
complex model is called an auto

24
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:12,359
regressive model where what we say is

25
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:15,000
that the price at time T is conditioned

26
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:17,969
on the price at times t minus 1 times

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,640
some coefficient plus some random

28
00:01:17,969 --> 00:01:23,429
distribution so it's linear over a short

29
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:27,509
time frames well what we'd say is that

30
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:31,590
it's a random walk that what's that

31
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:35,759
what's where the randomness is in the

32
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:41,430
rand is in the movement from yesterday's

33
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:43,709
price we're not there yet

34
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:45,960
we're only at a r1 we're not we're not

35
00:01:43,709 --> 00:01:48,478
close to where we're going so at a r1

36
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:50,069
we say that the randomness is in the

37
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:52,950
price movement from one day to the next

38
00:01:50,069 --> 00:01:54,508
and we say that those price movements

39
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:57,960
are drawn from a common shared

40
00:01:54,509 --> 00:02:00,149
distribution but that's not really how

41
00:01:57,959 --> 00:02:03,798
pricing works either because as we saw

42
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:07,409
in the financial crisis volatility is

43
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:10,349
not constant over time we have perience

44
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:12,659
periods of high volatility and we have

45
00:02:10,348 --> 00:02:13,349
periods of low volatility and so we can

46
00:02:12,659 --> 00:02:15,449
move from an

47
00:02:13,349 --> 00:02:17,549
our model to what we call an arch model

48
00:02:15,449 --> 00:02:19,889
which is an order aggressive conditional

49
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:24,270
heteroskedasticity model where we say

50
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:27,869
that the price movement at time X that

51
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:30,659
the Sigma at time at T rather let's go

52
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:33,300
away from access stick with time T that

53
00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:36,359
the Sigma at time T is conditioned on

54
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:38,160
Sigma at time T minus 1 and we can even

55
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,180
become more sophisticated than that and

56
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:40,439
we can go to a generalized

57
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:43,740
autoregressive conditional

58
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:47,370
heteroscedasticity model where we say

59
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:49,080
that volatility is seasonal volatilities

60
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:52,110
periodically conditioned and so forth

61
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:55,070
that only gives us though a single price

62
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:57,300
it gives us a good male good estimate of

63
00:02:55,069 --> 00:02:59,219
what a volatility is going to be in the

64
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:03,540
price risk for the near term but only

65
00:02:59,219 --> 00:03:06,060
for a single price point but we can take

66
00:03:03,539 --> 00:03:08,280
our GARCH model and we can lay it out in

67
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,569
a multivariate normal model and if we

68
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,280
lay out our guards from the multivariate

69
00:03:09,569 --> 00:03:15,349
normal it becomes a model called a C

70
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:18,360
cubed GARCH where Sigma at each point is

71
00:03:15,349 --> 00:03:21,750
related to the Sigma and the price

72
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:26,610
movements of the other prices in our

73
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:29,250
model well our Sigma instead of being a

74
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:32,690
single you know you know in a single

75
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:36,689
price model whether it's a R or GARCH

76
00:03:32,689 --> 00:03:39,120
Sigma is a is one number it's a scalar

77
00:03:36,689 --> 00:03:41,280
you go on to regress those then but

78
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,770
either in a multivariate model though

79
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:47,490
Sigma is a symmetric positive-definite

80
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:49,140
matrix because it has to relate the

81
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:51,990
covariance of every price to every other

82
00:03:49,139 --> 00:03:53,669
price and that's the concept that I was

83
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:55,879
trying to introduce in short form today

84
00:03:53,669 --> 00:03:58,049
which is that in connect we have

85
00:03:55,879 --> 00:04:00,889
positions in connect that are related to

86
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:03,030
each other according to the economic

87
00:04:00,889 --> 00:04:05,609
substitutability of two different

88
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:07,830
strains how close or distant two strains

89
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:10,950
are from each other is how good they are

90
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:12,000
as substitutes if you think about that

91
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:16,769
and if you think about how that should

92
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:19,139
relate to a pricing model there

93
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:20,849
substitutability is inversely

94
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:22,918
proportional or should be inversely

95
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:24,840
proportional to the covariance of the

96
00:04:22,918 --> 00:04:26,639
price shocks which means that our

97
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:29,369
connect distances

98
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:33,990
natural relationship to the Sigma matrix

99
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:36,360
in that C cubed arch model and it

100
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:38,009
becomes possible at that point if you

101
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,538
tried to figure out the price is what I

102
00:04:38,009 --> 00:04:41,598
was alluding to today if you try and

103
00:04:39,538 --> 00:04:44,128
figure out the price of a strain

104
00:04:41,598 --> 00:04:45,509
tomorrow when that strain hasn't traded

105
00:04:44,129 --> 00:04:46,889
in five months because there are

106
00:04:45,509 --> 00:04:48,509
thousands of strains they don't trade

107
00:04:46,889 --> 00:04:50,908
that often if you tried to figure out

108
00:04:48,509 --> 00:04:52,169
that price of that strain tomorrow when

109
00:04:50,908 --> 00:04:53,879
it hasn't traded in five months and do

110
00:04:52,168 --> 00:04:55,019
that directly you would have a very

111
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:57,990
rough time you're not gonna be able to

112
00:04:55,019 --> 00:05:00,269
do that on the other hand if you have a

113
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:02,400
covariance matrix and you have

114
00:05:00,269 --> 00:05:04,500
intervening prices in that intervening

115
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:06,899
five months for other prices and that

116
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:10,139
covariance matrix then you can have a

117
00:05:06,899 --> 00:05:11,579
pretty well grounded estimate of what

118
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:13,259
the new price will be for this strain

119
00:05:11,579 --> 00:05:15,418
that hasn't traded before or that hasn't

120
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:17,158
traded recently then these are wholesale

121
00:05:15,418 --> 00:05:19,528
prices I don't worry about the retail

122
00:05:17,158 --> 00:05:22,199
level we are a a company that operates

123
00:05:19,528 --> 00:05:25,288
at the wholesale level right yeah and

124
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:27,210
what this lets us do is to predict not

125
00:05:25,288 --> 00:05:27,899
an individual this is your likely price

126
00:05:27,209 --> 00:05:30,448
tomorrow

127
00:05:27,899 --> 00:05:33,870
it lets us predict a pretty narrow range

128
00:05:30,449 --> 00:05:35,759
of probabilistic prices for not today

129
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:37,829
but for a week from today two weeks for

130
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,750
today a month from today and that lets

131
00:05:37,829 --> 00:05:41,430
us help people to figure out what price

132
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:42,598
they can expect to obtain and help

133
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:45,800
people price their product on the market

134
00:05:42,598 --> 00:05:48,688
right so you're talking about enabling

135
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:52,050
what's now a commodity and now giving

136
00:05:48,689 --> 00:05:55,319
futures to that come on

137
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:57,389
you're a very insightful person born in

138
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:59,160
fact that that's exactly the direction

139
00:05:57,389 --> 00:06:02,280
we're heading is to figure out to be

140
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:05,280
able to accurately estimate not just the

141
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:07,589
price but what's the price risk over the

142
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:09,209
next month two months six months how

143
00:06:07,589 --> 00:06:10,619
much volatility is there in the market

144
00:06:09,209 --> 00:06:11,758
and what's relativity is going to be

145
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,560
associated with the strain with the

146
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,879
price of this strain and so forth

147
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,408
that's how other commodities are priced

148
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:19,530
and we would like to be able to start

149
00:06:16,408 --> 00:06:21,300
doing that as cannabis moves into an

150
00:06:19,529 --> 00:06:22,408
ordinary commodity that is to say a

151
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:26,370
commodity that's readily available

152
00:06:22,408 --> 00:06:28,490
that's efficiently priced where buyers

153
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:30,990
can get a reliable stream of Commerce

154
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:32,728
that's the kind of risk assessment that

155
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:35,759
you need to be able to do interesting

156
00:06:32,728 --> 00:06:38,939
could you as a chemist could you take a

157
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:40,500
similar model and apply it to statements

158
00:06:38,939 --> 00:06:42,120
about the potency of cannabis is

159
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:44,189
cannabis becoming more potent over time

160
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:47,610
or less potent or is it stagnating out

161
00:06:44,189 --> 00:06:50,968
could you apply it to questions like are

162
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:53,610
we seeing more what we refer to as

163
00:06:50,968 --> 00:06:55,529
indicas versus sativas more uppers or

164
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:57,870
downers could we get a sense of well

165
00:06:55,529 --> 00:07:00,149
indicas and sativas indicas and sativas

166
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:01,530
are chemically indistinguishable we see

167
00:07:00,149 --> 00:07:03,779
no significant differentiation between

168
00:07:01,529 --> 00:07:06,299
indicas and sativas there's a little bit

169
00:07:03,779 --> 00:07:08,429
of attendances what's down there's a

170
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:10,788
little bit of a tendency for sativas to

171
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:13,590
have more to pennilyn but that's it I

172
00:07:10,788 --> 00:07:15,658
don't know that there are uppers and

173
00:07:13,589 --> 00:07:20,429
downers distinctions that I can define

174
00:07:15,658 --> 00:07:23,579
chemically is the amount of THC growing

175
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:27,778
yes there is if you're selling cannabis

176
00:07:23,579 --> 00:07:29,370
as flour there are people who walk into

177
00:07:27,778 --> 00:07:32,129
the dispensary and what they're going to

178
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:33,840
pick is what has the most THC in it give

179
00:07:32,129 --> 00:07:37,319
me the stuff that's the strongest give

180
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:40,109
me the most THC for my THC dollar and so

181
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:41,639
producers are marketing to that and I

182
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:43,468
have to tell you I think from the

183
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:44,699
consumers perspective I think they're

184
00:07:43,468 --> 00:07:47,550
making a terrible mistake

185
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:51,930
if you have cannabis that has more than

186
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:53,430
you know 20% 25% THC in it there's a

187
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:55,139
limit to how high you can get and

188
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:58,400
there's certainly a limit to how high

189
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:58,400
you want to get and

190
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:04,579
it's hard for most people myself

191
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:06,050
included but really anybody that we've

192
00:08:04,579 --> 00:08:08,269
talked to any whenever we've done

193
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:11,300
research into this people are much

194
00:08:08,269 --> 00:08:14,000
happier with a cannabis that's 10% THC

195
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:16,879
and 10% CBD than they are with a

196
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,189
cannabis that's 35% th say you're going

197
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,960
to get frankly too high but nevertheless

198
00:08:19,189 --> 00:08:23,120
that's what producers are moving towards

199
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:24,769
and the other place where producers are

200
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,389
moving towards very high THC amounts is

201
00:08:24,769 --> 00:08:28,008
in production for extraction

202
00:08:26,389 --> 00:08:30,050
there's certainly demand for very high

203
00:08:28,009 --> 00:08:31,848
THC very high CBD in a very high

204
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:34,879
cannabinoid content for sale to

205
00:08:31,848 --> 00:08:36,979
extractors consumers would probably be

206
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:39,078
happier if they focus less on getting as

207
00:08:36,979 --> 00:08:41,810
much THC as they can and more on getting

208
00:08:39,078 --> 00:08:43,250
a balance of other psychoactive

209
00:08:41,809 --> 00:08:47,619
chemicals and they're in their cannabis

210
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:47,620
well thank you Amos thank you very much

211
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:57,569
