1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,969
I think so here's the deal with the with

2
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:23,100
with the with regulation I happen to be

3
00:00:20,969 --> 00:00:24,538
an old socialist I believe in regulation

4
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,550
I believe that regulation is the only

5
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:28,439
thing that keeps us from going at each

6
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:30,778
other's throats like a bunch of rabid

7
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:35,308
dogs regulations could save us they

8
00:00:30,778 --> 00:00:39,570
could also sink us because we don't have

9
00:00:35,308 --> 00:00:40,919
exactly enlightened electeds putting

10
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:42,238
this we can't count on them we have two

11
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,129
issues we have to shape it yeah that's

12
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:46,199
right we have to shape it and which

13
00:00:44,128 --> 00:00:47,488
brings me back to our own little cocoon

14
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,350
I was the chair of the steering

15
00:00:47,488 --> 00:00:51,058
committee for measure AF in Mendocino

16
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:53,399
County last year you know about measure

17
00:00:51,058 --> 00:00:55,468
AF I don't I mean I probably do but not

18
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:57,870
by name okay so in November we were

19
00:00:55,469 --> 00:01:01,109
going to it was a measure that was

20
00:00:57,869 --> 00:01:03,959
basically I came out of the Mendocino

21
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:06,329
cannabis Policy Council many activists

22
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,489
in the cannabis community since June of

23
00:01:06,329 --> 00:01:11,280
2014 and we took the language of the

24
00:01:08,489 --> 00:01:13,048
mikasa the medical bill that was signed

25
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,629
into law in October of 2015 and we

26
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:17,520
adapted it to Mendocino the people who

27
00:01:15,629 --> 00:01:19,469
were opposed to us leading that because

28
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:22,349
we came from the cannabis community did

29
00:01:19,469 --> 00:01:23,908
a trump on us they spread lies rumors it

30
00:01:22,349 --> 00:01:25,769
was vicious vicious vicious they

31
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:29,159
defeated us although the same people who

32
00:01:25,769 --> 00:01:32,280
voted against measure AF later voted for

33
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:34,079
prop 64 for the same language so anyway

34
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,700
that's it that's a whole other so you

35
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:37,469
know when we try to step out of our

36
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:40,680
little cocoon in our cannabis community

37
00:01:37,469 --> 00:01:43,469
sunk tons and tons of money and energy

38
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:46,020
into this and for many I mean I can't

39
00:01:43,469 --> 00:01:47,368
overstate this I come out of an activist

40
00:01:46,019 --> 00:01:49,228
background I've been involved in the

41
00:01:47,368 --> 00:01:50,849
world for a long time but these folks

42
00:01:49,228 --> 00:01:52,890
came up to these hills to get away from

43
00:01:50,849 --> 00:01:55,349
all that they are not interested in

44
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:56,159
government they hate government they're

45
00:01:55,349 --> 00:01:59,399
cynical

46
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:01,079
they barely vote a lot of them I don't

47
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:03,680
mean most of them but a lot of them and

48
00:02:01,078 --> 00:02:06,478
they're completely disillusioned isint

49
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:10,920
disenchanted and cynical about anything

50
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:13,770
to do with regulation government elected

51
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:19,769
officials any of that they're very very

52
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:22,800
cynical so we managed to mobilize but it

53
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:24,540
doesn't serve any purpose - you know we

54
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,510
have to figure it out we have to figure

55
00:02:24,539 --> 00:02:28,979
it out I mean as you know I like Thom

56
00:02:27,509 --> 00:02:30,449
Hartmann what he always says at the end

57
00:02:28,979 --> 00:02:33,269
of his show democracy is not a spectator

58
00:02:30,449 --> 00:02:35,099
sport if you step back and don't be

59
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:36,540
involved then don't even complain you

60
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:39,150
know if you can get in there and take

61
00:02:36,539 --> 00:02:41,009
charge and we are the elephant in the

62
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:42,480
room in Mendocino County we've run the

63
00:02:41,009 --> 00:02:44,399
economy for how long

64
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:47,639
ever since we lost lumber fishing all

65
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,349
that so we knew we had clout but nobody

66
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:53,879
wanted to talk about the elephant of the

67
00:02:49,349 --> 00:02:57,479
room so when we have something as public

68
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:59,340
as major AF forcing those of us who had

69
00:02:57,479 --> 00:03:00,569
never done it before I mean I had but

70
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:03,450
lots of people in the cannabis community

71
00:03:00,569 --> 00:03:05,400
to come talk to the Rotarian talk to the

72
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:07,139
Chamber of Commerce talk to go to the

73
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,849
ministerial College panel being out

74
00:03:07,139 --> 00:03:10,500
there and talk about show that you're a

75
00:03:08,849 --> 00:03:12,689
normal human being you don't have horns

76
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,099
you're not part of the Mexican Mafia you

77
00:03:12,689 --> 00:03:16,740
have children they go to school with

78
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:18,870
other people's children you buy real

79
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:21,689
estate you buy cars we are normal people

80
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:23,550
we had to normalize the whole image of

81
00:03:21,689 --> 00:03:25,829
the cannabis community in the meantime

82
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:27,209
our own worst enemy was internal to the

83
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:29,400
cannabis community because we have

84
00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:32,219
people who have been so isolated and so

85
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:34,500
cynical for so long and delusional

86
00:03:32,219 --> 00:03:37,109
innocent in the sense of they're so

87
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:39,120
firmly strongly believe we have also

88
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:41,130
firmly strongly believed in the magic

89
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,200
and the potency and the beauty of this

90
00:03:41,129 --> 00:03:44,159
herb and it's been a part of our culture

91
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:46,919
for so long

92
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:49,019
wrapped up in music and and three four

93
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:51,839
generations of family growers and

94
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:54,330
crafting the best cannabis in the world

95
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,849
creating the best medicines in the world

96
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:59,459
we were so full of ourselves and I'm one

97
00:03:56,849 --> 00:04:01,139
of those people that we had no idea that

98
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:03,959
the rest of the world was so against us

99
00:04:01,139 --> 00:04:05,879
and then stepping forward and trying to

100
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:08,069
really get engaged whoa

101
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:09,060
we were not slept around and everybody

102
00:04:08,069 --> 00:04:10,500
ran back up through the hills

103
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:13,019
see what happens if you get engaged you

104
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:15,569
with civic society yeah told you so

105
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:19,379
this is we can't have a civic civil

106
00:04:15,569 --> 00:04:23,909
society when that's the outcome you know

107
00:04:19,379 --> 00:04:25,490
so and we have to it's the only pattern

108
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:26,720
so we have four paths now

109
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:28,639
we talk about this all the time in

110
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,979
Mendocino amongst all the people who

111
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:33,199
come in and bring their beautiful crafts

112
00:04:30,978 --> 00:04:35,180
cannabis into dragonfly to sell it to us

113
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:37,610
throw gotta throw the towel in I had one

114
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:39,949
guy he's been a top shelf producer for

115
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:42,110
years and he's thrown the towel in and I

116
00:04:39,949 --> 00:04:44,240
said don't give up you're such a good

117
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:46,639
cultivator he says I joined the coop I

118
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:50,090
tried to try to pool my resources with

119
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:52,098
other small farmers and I gave him 12

120
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:53,598
units to sell the coop was we're gonna

121
00:04:52,098 --> 00:04:54,860
market this for you we're gonna get this

122
00:04:53,598 --> 00:04:56,810
out of the room gonna take care of you

123
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:57,949
and four or five months later they

124
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:59,780
called me said come on in and get

125
00:04:57,949 --> 00:05:01,879
something I was all excited go get paid

126
00:04:59,779 --> 00:05:03,709
for by 12 units they gave of eight units

127
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:05,629
back they couldn't move they move four

128
00:05:03,709 --> 00:05:08,239
units they couldn't move the rest of it

129
00:05:05,629 --> 00:05:10,490
because of the flood from Oregon and

130
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,538
everyplace else so he's like I can't

131
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:13,189
stand this I

132
00:05:11,538 --> 00:05:14,959
it's driving me crazy I'm throwing it so

133
00:05:13,189 --> 00:05:16,399
okay so one route is for people throw

134
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:18,348
the Talon and I can't tell you how many

135
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:19,609
people are thinking of doing that the

136
00:05:18,348 --> 00:05:22,668
other route is to stick with the black

137
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:24,830
market and look at you've got by

138
00:05:22,668 --> 00:05:26,750
conservative estimates Tom Allman the

139
00:05:24,829 --> 00:05:28,788
sheriff's estimates in Mendocino County

140
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:31,430
over 9,000 cultivators in Mendocino

141
00:05:28,788 --> 00:05:33,740
County they've had around 600 people

142
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:37,449
apply for a cultivation permit in the

143
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:40,848
county so far they've issued one or two

144
00:05:37,449 --> 00:05:42,530
permits depending on - now they've

145
00:05:40,848 --> 00:05:47,060
issued two permits

146
00:05:42,529 --> 00:05:48,198
hey big whoop so they're like why should

147
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:49,430
I get involved in that that I'm gonna

148
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:50,270
stick with the black bear well we know

149
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:52,098
that's a dead end

150
00:05:50,269 --> 00:05:54,468
that's a dead end the black market is

151
00:05:52,098 --> 00:05:56,718
not gonna go on so what's your third

152
00:05:54,468 --> 00:05:58,668
option join a co-op people don't have

153
00:05:56,718 --> 00:06:01,129
the resources the wherewithal they don't

154
00:05:58,668 --> 00:06:02,750
know is it an LLC is it an S corp do I

155
00:06:01,129 --> 00:06:04,699
have to get a lawyer I mean people are

156
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:06,620
without proper you know all that they

157
00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:09,740
don't know they don't know and then the

158
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:11,629
the fourth thing is find somebody who

159
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:13,340
will come and give you investment money

160
00:06:11,629 --> 00:06:16,310
so you can scale up find your view your

161
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:17,929
private VC well let me tell you if you

162
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:21,379
far between and they're not looking at

163
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:23,718
us because what's the endemic nature of

164
00:06:21,379 --> 00:06:25,490
a green wash a green rush and I got this

165
00:06:23,718 --> 00:06:26,899
when I went to Las Vegas for one of the

166
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:28,968
big business conferences I stand behind

167
00:06:26,899 --> 00:06:31,129
a guy at the big 10 gallon hat with this

168
00:06:28,968 --> 00:06:33,259
big Texas drawl he was standing in line

169
00:06:31,129 --> 00:06:35,120
to register and I said hey you here from

170
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:36,500
Texas he goes yeah I want to learn all

171
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,090
about this cannabis industry

172
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,589
nice

173
00:06:37,089 --> 00:06:40,569
well cool are you coming from the Texas

174
00:06:38,589 --> 00:06:42,609
cannabis industry goes no I'm from oil

175
00:06:40,569 --> 00:06:44,439
and gas but I see where the money's at

176
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:46,810
so you got all these people jumping into

177
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:50,649
a green rush they want to make huge

178
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:52,569
volume crap mcwrap pot mediocre products

179
00:06:50,649 --> 00:06:54,310
make a lot of money and get out that's

180
00:06:52,569 --> 00:06:55,478
the nature of a Green Rush or a gold

181
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:58,209
rush or whatever you want to call it

182
00:06:55,478 --> 00:07:00,689
that does not include investing in these

183
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:04,029
small entrepreneurs manufacturers

184
00:07:00,689 --> 00:07:05,978
farmers and supporting them to create to

185
00:07:04,029 --> 00:07:08,829
keep the intellectual property the

186
00:07:05,978 --> 00:07:10,240
heritage the traditions the family craft

187
00:07:08,829 --> 00:07:11,978
that we've developed for all these

188
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,680
decades we're going to lose all of that

189
00:07:11,978 --> 00:07:16,569
and it's a tremendous loss it's a

190
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,228
tremendous loss to all of us to the

191
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:19,389
whole country

192
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:21,879
to the world because there's no finer

193
00:07:19,389 --> 00:07:23,590
cannabis in the world no finer medicines

194
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:25,839
in the world and I'm not I'm not just

195
00:07:23,589 --> 00:07:27,819
using hyperbole then in Northern

196
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:31,269
California because of that interesting

197
00:07:27,819 --> 00:07:34,029
confluence of Sun and virgin soil tpz

198
00:07:31,269 --> 00:07:36,399
land and water so we're gonna lose it

199
00:07:34,029 --> 00:07:39,599
all I'm afraid because those those VC

200
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:39,599
they're not looking for these people

201
00:07:42,069 --> 00:07:47,740
up to what they're going to be and when

202
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:50,660
they look at it I mean I just

203
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:52,519
you didn't miss math on a napkin

204
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:55,630
Matt's dangerous napkin is pretty

205
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:55,629
intense yeah

206
00:08:00,449 --> 00:08:06,509
[Music]

207
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:08,310
any waiver yeah well just from a

208
00:08:06,509 --> 00:08:10,920
dispensary point of view you know last

209
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:13,199
Monday I had to give the county $4,400 I

210
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:15,449
didn't pay my house note I had to lay

211
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,439
staff off I can't you know nobody's

212
00:08:15,449 --> 00:08:20,939
gonna stay alive

213
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:23,730
nobody's gonna stay alive that's how

214
00:08:20,939 --> 00:08:25,769
business comes in and you know the

215
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:27,300
little guy yeah so little guys do have

216
00:08:25,769 --> 00:08:28,879
to join together figure out a way to

217
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:32,399
join together that's what this market is

218
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:34,408
good this and all the markets that we

219
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,000
have in Mendocino we have another one up

220
00:08:34,408 --> 00:08:38,370
in Mendocino Village Everett once a

221
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,349
month it's a farmers market and it's it

222
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:42,418
creates community but what I find in

223
00:08:40,349 --> 00:08:44,430
talking to all of these farmers is they

224
00:08:42,418 --> 00:08:46,740
feel so good coming to these markets

225
00:08:44,429 --> 00:08:49,109
they don't sell very much but meeting

226
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:51,029
with each other building ties creating

227
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:53,120
community that what I'm hearing them say

228
00:08:51,029 --> 00:08:57,689
is all of these incredibly glowing

229
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:59,310
idealistic utopian ideas see if we could

230
00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:01,140
just all be together and support each

231
00:08:59,309 --> 00:09:03,750
other it's all these abstractions and

232
00:09:01,139 --> 00:09:07,019
they really don't have a clue they don't

233
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:09,659
have a clue how rough and mean the

234
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:11,699
venture capital world is or in

235
00:09:09,659 --> 00:09:16,019
combination with politicians who are

236
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:18,660
just going to bow lean over and get in

237
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:21,809
the but by you know I mean they just

238
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:23,610
don't have a clue you know in a way I

239
00:09:21,809 --> 00:09:25,319
mean so many people in in in the

240
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:27,210
cannabis community are incredibly

241
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,970
they've been isolated for so long and

242
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:35,639
they really are not skilled or tooled up

243
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:38,370
to do this you know that's oh hey I hate

244
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:40,949
sounding so pessimistic it's just yeah

245
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:44,759
it's really it breaks my heart to see

246
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:46,080
these people um espousing a tract that

247
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:47,819
they're gonna take that I know I'm

248
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:51,759
listening and I know you can't possibly

249
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:55,490
do that it's not gonna happen

250
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:57,889
yeah it's a heartbreak so the one thing

251
00:09:55,490 --> 00:10:00,889
that does work really well when you have

252
00:09:57,889 --> 00:10:03,049
this kind of communication as people can

253
00:10:00,889 --> 00:10:06,110
begin well it's like what I was telling

254
00:10:03,049 --> 00:10:09,259
Chris we've got that opportunity to to

255
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:12,259
have a robust and challenging dialogue

256
00:10:09,259 --> 00:10:14,629
in our community let's do that instead

257
00:10:12,259 --> 00:10:17,419
of I mean I can't tell you for two days

258
00:10:14,629 --> 00:10:19,100
I'm just like here we go man I got the

259
00:10:17,419 --> 00:10:22,939
best high off of this pot and it just

260
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:25,070
goes on and on and on and on we got to

261
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:27,140
drop the stoner culture we got to just

262
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:28,610
drop some of it keep it for your private

263
00:10:27,139 --> 00:10:33,490
social life on Saturday night with your

264
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:33,490
friends but it dominates the dialogue

265
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:48,360
