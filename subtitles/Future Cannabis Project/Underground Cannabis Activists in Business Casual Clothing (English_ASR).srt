1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:09,540
it is such an incredibly strange and

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:14,339
amazing evolutionary historical moment

3
00:00:09,539 --> 00:00:16,019
that we're in in terms of you know some

4
00:00:14,339 --> 00:00:19,759
of the cannabis industry from my

5
00:00:16,019 --> 00:00:23,879
perspective is you took a culture of

6
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:26,250
underground activists and now you've put

7
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:31,049
them in business casual clothing and

8
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:34,679
turned them into ninjas who have to play

9
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:38,128
an insane high-stakes tetris match with

10
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:42,269
the government and like state and local

11
00:00:38,128 --> 00:00:44,699
ordinances to preserve like the soul of

12
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:48,420
what they were trying to do you know

13
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:51,210
like it's like this is the part I like

14
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:55,579
to make clear of like we're in this

15
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:59,789
weird you know running match with like

16
00:00:55,579 --> 00:01:02,759
fucking target to decide who gets to

23
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:23,579
world we want to create with this

24
00:01:19,769 --> 00:01:26,368
industry like how do we get to sit at

25
00:01:23,579 --> 00:01:29,009
the table how do we get to navigate the

26
00:01:26,368 --> 00:01:31,799
process how do we get to participate in

27
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:34,438
inform policy which is still being

28
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:36,868
written and for God's sakes please let

be written by the people who suffered

31
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:45,899
and built the industry not by the yahoos

32
00:01:43,618 --> 00:01:47,549
coming from Pharma who are like I've got

33

we're good let's do this you know it's

35
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:55,078
it's ethically insane and questionable

36
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:56,700
that so many people are excited about

37
00:01:55,078 --> 00:01:59,758
making money in cannabis while people

38
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:04,320
are still in jail for cannabis crimes

39
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:07,109
it's insane that the John Boehner and

40
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:08,728
the Republicans and Mitch whatever the

41
00:02:07,109 --> 00:02:10,590
hell his name is and all the excited

42
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:13,739
people about hamper like let's put

43
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:16,979
median malls you know that is insane to

44
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:19,800
me while we are still struggling to get

45
00:02:16,979 --> 00:02:22,649
our social equity applicants operational

46
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:26,489
in Los Angeles it's it's completely

47
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:29,549
insane so as boring as it sounds to some

48
00:02:26,489 --> 00:02:33,569
people about compliance in these things

49
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:36,269
like we are your ninja team that is here

50
00:02:33,568 --> 00:02:39,109
