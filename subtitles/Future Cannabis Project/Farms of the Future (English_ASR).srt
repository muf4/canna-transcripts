1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,259
[Music]

2
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:14,370
so the assumptions I want to start with

3
00:00:10,259 --> 00:00:16,138
for this panel discussion is that indoor

4
00:00:14,369 --> 00:00:18,179
agricultural facilities will use a lot

5
00:00:16,138 --> 00:00:21,149
of power based on sole source lighting

6
00:00:18,179 --> 00:00:22,649
as our main strategy so we're gonna talk

7
00:00:21,149 --> 00:00:24,778
a little bit about how business models

8
00:00:22,649 --> 00:00:26,579
and growing different growing systems

9
00:00:24,778 --> 00:00:28,829
are going to revolve around that

10
00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:30,509
assumption then we're gonna move to then

11
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:32,699
we're gonna also keep in mind that crops

12
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:34,410
being grown currently have limitations

13
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:37,290
that in terms of what price points we

14
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:40,589
can hit so as we look at how we're gonna

15
00:00:37,289 --> 00:00:43,378
utilize energy and utilities light HVAC

16
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:45,149
we do have limitations we can't use as

17
00:00:43,378 --> 00:00:46,829
much as we want to whenever we want to

18
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:49,859
because we may not be able to afford

19
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:52,439
what to sell what we're growing and then

20
00:00:49,859 --> 00:00:53,789
finally there's a lot of talk when we're

21
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:56,549
dealing with indoor agriculture about

22
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:59,280
extremely niche crops but there is also

23
00:00:56,549 --> 00:01:00,569
a lot of different indoor AG food

24
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,570
producing projects that are out there

25
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:06,060
and those niche markets will be quickly

26
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:07,228
saturated and we need to think about

27
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:10,109
what we're gonna be able to do in terms

28
00:01:07,228 --> 00:01:12,030
of accessing broader market so based on

29
00:01:10,109 --> 00:01:13,950
I want you to keep those assumptions in

30
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:16,349
mind as we go through the panel

31
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:18,359
discussion and with that I'm gonna start

32
00:01:16,349 --> 00:01:20,368
by letting each panel member introduce

33
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:21,868
themselves and give a short presentation

34
00:01:20,368 --> 00:01:22,438
on their company and their background

35
00:01:21,868 --> 00:01:23,790
okay

36
00:01:22,438 --> 00:01:28,048
we're gonna start with Sam from arrow

37
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:30,810
farms my name is Sam Schatz I'm a

38
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:32,729
managing director at arrow farms

39
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:36,118
so basically arrow farms we're

40
00:01:32,728 --> 00:01:38,670
controlled environment agriculture we

41
00:01:36,118 --> 00:01:42,540
been operating now vertical farm in

42
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:45,329
Newark for the last three and a half

43
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:48,210
years a commercial farm the company was

44
00:01:45,328 --> 00:01:50,149
originally founded in 2004 actually out

45
00:01:48,209 --> 00:01:54,269
of the Cornell School of Agriculture and

46
00:01:50,149 --> 00:01:57,090
we were an OEM for much of the 2000s and

47
00:01:54,269 --> 00:02:00,239
then we reformed the company in 2011

48
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:03,240
around owning and operating these farms

49
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:06,539
we built our kind of first model three

50
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:08,139
farm back in 2013 and built many

51
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:11,780
subsequent farms

52
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:12,949
since then it all in Newark as I

53
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:14,960
mentioned we went operating the

54
00:02:12,949 --> 00:02:16,639
large-scale production facility now for

55
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:19,129
about three years the design for that

56
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:23,059
facility is about five years old we're

57
00:02:19,129 --> 00:02:24,799
in the process right now of closing on

58
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:27,920
the funding of our next project which

59
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,870
will be in Virginia which will be you

60
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:33,379
know the next the next iteration of the

61
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:35,330
design we're very excited about that we

62
00:02:33,379 --> 00:02:36,949
have been selling the retailers like

63
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:42,580
Whole Foods and Shop Rite Fresh Direct

64
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:45,409
and we've also brought in financing from

65
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:48,260
many different institutional types of

66
00:02:45,409 --> 00:02:50,810
investors but just to summarize we've

67
00:02:48,259 --> 00:02:52,989
we've managed to bring in about 200

68
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:55,909
million dollars of equity capital over

69
00:02:52,990 --> 00:03:01,280
about four rounds of funding over the

70
00:02:55,909 --> 00:03:02,689
last six years or so so I guess we can

71
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,900
go what I'll do is I'll talk next about

72
00:03:02,689 --> 00:03:08,659
the technology which a very high level

73
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:09,950
here so we built in a number of

74
00:03:08,659 --> 00:03:12,680
different spaces I'd like to show this

75
00:03:09,949 --> 00:03:14,359
video because it you know if a picture

76
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,560
can speak a thousand words a video can

77
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,390
do much more than that I only have

78
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,979
another minute here I think but

79
00:03:17,389 --> 00:03:20,539
basically this was one of the first

80
00:03:18,979 --> 00:03:24,530
farms that we built it's three towers

81
00:03:20,539 --> 00:03:26,299
this was actually an old paintball laser

82
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:31,039
tag facility that we converted to

83
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:33,050
growing food and we we actually operated

84
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:34,340
this and then this was the next farm we

85
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:36,260
built after that this is one that we're

86
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:38,300
actually still operating this is in also

87
00:03:36,259 --> 00:03:42,019
in New York and now these towers are

88
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:44,989
about 36 feet high and they're growing

89
00:03:42,019 --> 00:03:47,480
food year round using 95 percent less

90
00:03:44,989 --> 00:03:51,769
water than field grown crops about 50

91
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:53,629
percent less fertilizer and the small

92
00:03:51,769 --> 00:03:55,550
small fraction of the land and zero

93
00:03:53,629 --> 00:03:58,099
pesticides so the product that we grow

94
00:03:55,550 --> 00:04:00,140
doesn't need to be washed it can go

95
00:03:58,099 --> 00:04:01,939
right into the package which obviously

96
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:03,169
skips a very big step because you don't

97
00:04:01,939 --> 00:04:05,209
need to wash it you don't need to drive

98
00:04:03,169 --> 00:04:08,569
those right into the package and it can

99
00:04:05,209 --> 00:04:11,409
be sold to customers and we're currently

100
00:04:08,569 --> 00:04:16,250
we're selling throughout the Northeast

101
00:04:11,409 --> 00:04:18,370
about eight different SKUs as you can

102
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:21,038
see here we're

103
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:23,978
using LEDs latest in LED technology

104
00:04:21,038 --> 00:04:26,680
everything that you see here arrow farms

105
00:04:23,978 --> 00:04:29,228
is vertically integrated so we designed

106
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:31,990
engineered manufactured installed and

107
00:04:29,228 --> 00:04:34,959
then we operate these farms and

108
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:37,360
continuously improve on not just the

109
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:40,149
engineering components but also on the

110
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,830
growing algorithms that we use nutrient

111
00:04:40,149 --> 00:04:44,198
delivery and all of the kind of

112
00:04:41,829 --> 00:04:47,579
supporting systems and harvesting

113
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:49,689
packaging seeding germination etc so

114
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:51,848
anyway I wanted to share that obviously

115
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:53,769
a lot of a lot of great things to

116
00:04:51,848 --> 00:04:55,449
discuss on this panel I will say that

117
00:04:53,769 --> 00:04:57,758
the the leafy green part of our business

118
00:04:55,449 --> 00:04:59,620
is just one part of our business and

119
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,939
we're vertically integrated to go into

120
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:03,759
many different crops and so we're

121
00:05:00,939 --> 00:05:05,228
actively pursuing many crops in addition

122
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:08,979
to what these systems are engineered for

123
00:05:05,228 --> 00:05:11,110
so thank you good morning everyone my

124
00:05:08,978 --> 00:05:13,508
name is Javed Abraham I'm a lead systems

125
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:16,240
design at Agra tech chure consulting a

126
00:05:13,509 --> 00:05:17,129
grow texture is a tech agnostic new

127
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,710
york-based

128
00:05:17,129 --> 00:05:22,408
agriculture consulting company we focus

129
00:05:20,709 --> 00:05:25,959
in controlled environment agriculture

130
00:05:22,408 --> 00:05:28,899
and we consult mostly on greenhouses and

131
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:32,138
vertical farms so we're not married to

132
00:05:28,899 --> 00:05:35,429
one system type or the other we look at

133
00:05:32,139 --> 00:05:37,240
each client's needs based on the

134
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:39,129
particular market that they're operating

135
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:41,639
in and the crop that they want to grow

136
00:05:39,129 --> 00:05:44,079
and we help them to plan their business

137
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:46,990
for profitability and for a long-term

138
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:50,079
success we approach each project with a

139
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:52,598
triple bottom-line perspective looking

140
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:55,418
at the the social benefits of their

141
00:05:52,598 --> 00:05:58,300
business the economic benefits as well

142
00:05:55,418 --> 00:06:00,639
as the the environmental benefits so

143
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:03,038
there's really a lot that goes into

144
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:05,199
planning a controlled environment farm

145
00:06:03,038 --> 00:06:06,668
you have to look at market pricing you

146
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:09,250
have to look at equipment availability

147
00:06:06,668 --> 00:06:11,680
the crop you're growing and then design

148
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:14,129
around those parameters rather than the

149
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:17,259
other way around we see a lot of

150
00:06:14,129 --> 00:06:19,870
companies and individuals trying to

151
00:06:17,259 --> 00:06:21,968
basically force systems in places where

152
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:25,000
they don't necessarily work or trying to

153
00:06:21,968 --> 00:06:27,459
produce crops in them that don't produce

154
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,060
a positive return on investment in that

155
00:06:27,459 --> 00:06:31,000
particular

156
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:33,550
market and then that's basically setting

157
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,279
yourself up for failure so we try and

158
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:41,319
steer our clients away from that that

159
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:43,689
fate essentially and we have had the

160
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:45,939
opportunity to work on over a hundred

161
00:06:43,689 --> 00:06:48,759
projects in 20 different countries in

162
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:51,399
the past four years and these services

163
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:53,918
range for from everything from market

164
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:56,888
research to farm design feasibility

165
00:06:53,918 --> 00:07:01,180
studies as well as novel system due

166
00:06:56,889 --> 00:07:04,269
diligence and it kind of investigations

167
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:07,000
into system efficacy there are really a

168
00:07:04,269 --> 00:07:09,189
lot of factors that drive whether a

169
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,918
client will choose to go with one CA

170
00:07:09,189 --> 00:07:15,040
system or another and as you can see on

171
00:07:11,918 --> 00:07:18,459
that slide there's quite a few kind of

172
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:20,470
factors that we look at when we look at

173
00:07:18,459 --> 00:07:23,049
these the way these systems operate in

174
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:26,139
these particular regions you know water

175
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:27,939
scarcity is a big driver these days and

176
00:07:26,139 --> 00:07:30,970
we hear a lot about water use and

177
00:07:27,939 --> 00:07:32,769
efficiency in these farms and you know

178
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:34,630
the difference between an evaporatively

179
00:07:32,769 --> 00:07:38,439
cooled greenhouse and a completely

180
00:07:34,629 --> 00:07:39,969
enclosed vertical farm a lot of that

181
00:07:38,439 --> 00:07:41,918
difference comes to the water use of

182
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:44,320
those particular systems so in

183
00:07:41,918 --> 00:07:45,909
California for example you would lose

184
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:47,589
more water through an evaporatively

185
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:49,750
cooled greenhouse than you would through

186
00:07:47,589 --> 00:07:52,389
a completely enclosed vertical farm and

187
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:55,870
if water is really your pain point your

188
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:58,089
operation then we would look at how you

189
00:07:55,870 --> 00:08:00,038
can manage those specific resources

190
00:07:58,089 --> 00:08:03,519
based on the strains in your particular

191
00:08:00,038 --> 00:08:06,569
region we are an interdisciplinary group

192
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:08,918
we are a healthy mix of agronomist

193
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:12,219
engineers policy experts and

194
00:08:08,918 --> 00:08:13,779
sustainability experts and as I said

195
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:16,300
before we look at each client's

196
00:08:13,779 --> 00:08:18,538
individual needs and we assess those

197
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:22,590
with a triple bottom line approach and

198
00:08:18,538 --> 00:08:22,589
keeping sustainability in mind

199
00:08:24,529 --> 00:08:29,459
good morning everyone my name is grant

200
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:31,439
vandenBosch despite the very long last

201
00:08:29,459 --> 00:08:35,159
name and three consonants I am NOT Dutch

202
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:37,799
i I do have a Belgian Belgian heritage

203
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:40,079
so I guess it was meant for me to come

204
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:42,329
into this industry so before I briefly

205
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,670
touch on Who I am and who we are at fits

206
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:46,290
season my role as chief category officer

207
00:08:44,669 --> 00:08:47,969
and in the in the spirit of the

208
00:08:46,289 --> 00:08:49,889
conference set by Derek I just wanted to

209
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:53,370
very very briefly sound my personal

210
00:08:49,889 --> 00:08:54,689
reason why we decided and I decided to

211
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:58,019
come to this conference you know I think

212
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:59,970
as we think about energy usage for for

213
00:08:58,019 --> 00:09:02,279
food production specifically for leafy

214
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:05,730
greens and indoor environments as as we

215
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:08,250
all do up here this is this is a really

216
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:09,810
high cost driver for us so it's figuring

217
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:11,639
this out is a strategic competitive

218
00:09:09,809 --> 00:09:13,049
advantage but when you look at the

219
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:15,870
mission of a lot of our companies it's

220
00:09:13,049 --> 00:09:18,059
also one that's sustainability oriented

221
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:20,700
and and it's one with a higher purpose

222
00:09:18,059 --> 00:09:22,709
so it can be a difficult conversation to

223
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:25,080
have when you think about the importance

224
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:27,509
of being able to be competitive on your

225
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:29,520
energy usage and it's it's not something

226
00:09:27,509 --> 00:09:31,379
that I think I have the answers to or

227
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,329
maybe even we all appear on the stage

228
00:09:31,379 --> 00:09:35,759
have the answers to but I think coming

229
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:37,650
together with this very diverse group is

230
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:39,840
how we can find the solution for how to

231
00:09:37,649 --> 00:09:43,319
have the conversation to share best

232
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:45,180
practices so so that's why I'm here my

233
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,740
role at fifth season as chief category

234
00:09:45,179 --> 00:09:48,659
officer is really to lead corporate

235
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:51,389
strategy marketing sales business

236
00:09:48,659 --> 00:09:53,399
development and and broadline how we

237
00:09:51,389 --> 00:09:56,759
think about our overall go to market

238
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:58,889
strategy so we we grow leafy greens and

239
00:09:56,759 --> 00:10:00,990
herbs indoors in robotic vertical farms

240
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:03,330
we have human free grow rooms that are

241
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:06,210
connected to a highly automated

242
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:08,190
production process that operates much

243
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:10,639
closer to a smart manufacturing system

244
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:13,200
than it actually does a traditional farm

245
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:15,419
Chris asked me to come on here and talk

246
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:18,240
about crop types and the purpose for

247
00:10:15,419 --> 00:10:20,699
some of the crop types this this map

248
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:23,490
here that you see I'm sure you all have

249
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:24,930
probably seen it before the reason why I

250
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:27,090
chose to continue to use it is because

251
00:10:24,929 --> 00:10:29,579
it's still the driving factor for why

252
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:32,399
why our businesses are able to be

253
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:35,160
successful the fact that you know 86

254
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,309
percent of consumers are consuming leafy

255
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:38,649
greens that are

256
00:10:36,309 --> 00:10:40,869
not from the state where or even a

257
00:10:38,649 --> 00:10:43,778
locality from where they're they're

258
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:45,340
consuming them it is just forcing

259
00:10:43,778 --> 00:10:47,289
consumers to settle for an experience

260
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:48,940
that quite honestly is now it's not

261
00:10:47,289 --> 00:10:51,399
matching their beliefs when they walk up

262
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:52,900
to that category so it over the past

263
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:55,329
couple years is you think about the

264
00:10:52,899 --> 00:10:57,789
wellness trend starting to infiltrate

265
00:10:55,330 --> 00:11:01,690
just about every single decision of

266
00:10:57,789 --> 00:11:03,278
people's lives retailers as as well as

267
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:05,740
consumers are looking at the leafy green

268
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:07,750
category with it with a new lens and so

269
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:11,409
there's there's a lot of demand driving

270
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:13,870
leafy greens and herbs broadly it's it's

271
00:11:11,409 --> 00:11:16,838
not just from that that kind of very

272
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:20,320
focused focused group so a lot of us do

273
00:11:16,839 --> 00:11:23,230
grow it for that for that as one of the

274
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,940
reasons amongst many others I you know I

275
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:27,879
think one of the other things I wanted

276
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:29,529
to quickly mention is that when Chris

277
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:31,870
set the assumptions for this this

278
00:11:29,528 --> 00:11:34,419
conversation I think one of them is

279
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:36,310
really important to to come back on

280
00:11:34,419 --> 00:11:39,729
which is you know the consumer can't pay

281
00:11:36,309 --> 00:11:41,739
$100 you know per ounce

282
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:44,259
for for leafy greens it's just it's just

283
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:47,259
not going to happen so many of us here

284
00:11:44,259 --> 00:11:49,809
do have to face the reality of a math

285
00:11:47,259 --> 00:11:51,750
problem that most farms have struggled

286
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:53,500
with for for hundreds of years and so

287
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:57,070
thinking through everything from

288
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:58,480
production to output to grow science and

289
00:11:57,070 --> 00:12:00,490
how everything comes together into a

290
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,080
system that allows you to to justify the

291
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:04,450
high capital expenditure for a lot of

292
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:06,580
these facilities is exactly what a lot

293
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:09,460
of us deal with when we think about just

294
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:10,330
trying to compete on shelf with with $2

295
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:15,089
a pound

296
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:15,089
you know big leaf flat cooking spinach

297
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:24,899
all right well with that I've got some

298
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:27,030
prepared questions for the group so we

299
00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:28,709
can gotta get the conversation started I

300
00:12:27,029 --> 00:12:30,269
want to do is start with Jive Eden and

301
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:32,670
since there

302
00:12:30,269 --> 00:12:34,679
their company is more focused on helping

303
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:37,319
growers find ways to implement systems

304
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:40,169
what I want to do is is ask you the

305
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:41,550
question what type of growing systems

306
00:12:40,169 --> 00:12:43,919
have you seen most people looking

307
00:12:41,549 --> 00:12:46,829
towards and you know kind of give us an

308
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:49,469
idea of why they why and how they

309
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:53,940
determine the energy impact with those

310
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:57,590
systems so to answer your first question

311
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:59,700
I would say it depends on the scale of

312
00:12:57,590 --> 00:13:02,250
investment or funding that they've

313
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:05,690
received so far and kind of what stage

314
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:08,279
at development they are a lot of kind of

315
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:09,780
categorized as beginners or people who

316
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:12,750
are just entering this industry for the

317
00:13:09,779 --> 00:13:15,089
first time are often looking at smaller

318
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:18,720
pilot systems so container farm systems

319
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:21,060
are very popular for that that group but

320
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,889
then there are there's a constituency of

321
00:13:21,059 --> 00:13:24,599
investors out there who are raising

322
00:13:22,889 --> 00:13:28,379
higher amounts of capital and looking to

323
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:30,930
implement novel larger systems that

324
00:13:28,379 --> 00:13:33,509
would go into a warehouse envelope so

325
00:13:30,929 --> 00:13:36,089
you know these are companies like arrow

326
00:13:33,509 --> 00:13:39,179
farms and you know plenty

327
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:41,280
Bowery companies of that sort so I would

328
00:13:39,179 --> 00:13:46,559
say it's a it's a good mix between the

329
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:48,509
two and there's almost always there's an

330
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:51,209
immediate interest in going for a

331
00:13:48,509 --> 00:13:53,610
vertical farm envelope and we always

332
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:56,070
stress that our clients should also

333
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:57,680
assess the the efficacy of going with a

334
00:13:56,070 --> 00:14:00,720
greenhouse for that particular region

335
00:13:57,679 --> 00:14:04,319
and we help them in kind of comparing

336
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:07,590
those two systems as far as energy use

337
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:09,379
you know yield output cost of

338
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:13,530
implementation as well as long-term

339
00:14:09,379 --> 00:14:15,240
operational cost so there there are some

340
00:14:13,529 --> 00:14:18,120
regions in which vertical farms will

341
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:20,789
work well consistently year-round and

342
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:23,070
then others where greenhouses can you

343
00:14:20,789 --> 00:14:24,809
know produce a bit more cheaply they may

344
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:26,790
be a bit further from the metropolitan

345
00:14:24,809 --> 00:14:28,559
area but you're still within local range

346
00:14:26,789 --> 00:14:29,929
and I'm sorry what was your second

347
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:31,549
question

348
00:14:29,929 --> 00:14:32,989
well let's jump let's take that and

349
00:14:31,549 --> 00:14:35,870
develop that answer a little bit further

350
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:37,789
let's say if you look at clients that

351
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:39,139
you've had and compare small growers to

352
00:14:37,789 --> 00:14:40,879
large growers and let's let's make the

353
00:14:39,139 --> 00:14:43,429
assumption that they do want to go to

354
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:45,909
indoor farming what sort of limitations

355
00:14:43,429 --> 00:14:48,739
do they have in even choosing equipment

356
00:14:45,909 --> 00:14:51,338
for their for their project and let's

357
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:55,310
focus on the small grower sure yeah so

358
00:14:51,339 --> 00:14:58,060
the limitations are often capital these

359
00:14:55,309 --> 00:15:01,699
systems aren't you know cheap it's not

360
00:14:58,059 --> 00:15:03,199
inexpensive to put LEDs over every

361
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:05,810
square foot of bed space that you have

362
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:09,170
and to run those LEDs every day

363
00:15:05,809 --> 00:15:11,208
so I would say it's a lot of capital

364
00:15:09,169 --> 00:15:13,639
limitations more than anything and then

365
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:15,919
there are some knowledge gaps as well

366
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:17,778
that we help fill as far as you know

367
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:19,699
what are the production parameters for

368
00:15:17,778 --> 00:15:21,470
those particular crops how do you

369
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:25,940
package them how do you maintain a

370
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:28,399
consistency day to day in your output as

371
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:30,050
well as how do you comply with a lot of

372
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:32,419
the regulations that are out there and

373
00:15:30,049 --> 00:15:35,479
bringing that product to market so one

374
00:15:32,419 --> 00:15:36,948
more question for you on that is when I

375
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:38,778
was listening to one of the panel

376
00:15:36,948 --> 00:15:41,990
discussions yesterday and they were they

377
00:15:38,778 --> 00:15:43,429
were given an example of how a farm has

378
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:47,028
gone through a lot of different

379
00:15:43,429 --> 00:15:48,379
generations of HVAC equipment my

380
00:15:47,028 --> 00:15:50,750
experience has been that a lot of the

381
00:15:48,379 --> 00:15:53,629
small farms inherit their HVAC equipment

382
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:56,328
if you're inherit in your experience if

383
00:15:53,629 --> 00:15:58,578
you are inheriting an HVAC HVAC

384
00:15:56,328 --> 00:16:00,319
equipment how does that play into the

385
00:15:58,578 --> 00:16:02,169
choices that you might have sure that's

386
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,430
a that's a really good question

387
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:08,059
we have seen a lot of inherited

388
00:16:04,429 --> 00:16:10,099
equipment in general HVAC also hydro

389
00:16:08,059 --> 00:16:13,489
inherited hydroponic systems and

390
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:16,100
inherited irrigation systems etc but

391
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:17,600
when it comes to HVAC when it's

392
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:20,360
inherited it's probably not sized

393
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:22,278
correctly and when it's not sized

394
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:23,778
correctly you're either you have too

395
00:16:22,278 --> 00:16:26,000
large of a system that'll kick on and

396
00:16:23,778 --> 00:16:28,309
off too frequently and lower the

397
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,889
lifetime of the equipment or it doesn't

398
00:16:28,309 --> 00:16:33,139
have properly sized dehumidification and

399
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:35,509
we find in general dehumidification is

400
00:16:33,139 --> 00:16:36,519
often overlooked when it comes to

401
00:16:35,509 --> 00:16:38,080
completely

402
00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:40,750
you know enclosed systems like vertical

403
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:43,240
farms and humidity is one of the biggest

404
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:44,950
challenges that we face when you have

405
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:46,990
crops growing in a box they're

406
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:49,060
constantly transpiring and you have to

407
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:51,250
keep those humidity loads down in order

408
00:16:49,059 --> 00:16:53,739
to keep paper pressure deficit in range

409
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:56,049
and to maintain consistent growth so

410
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:57,909
it's it's a challenge and usually when

411
00:16:56,049 --> 00:17:01,419
equipment is inherited

412
00:16:57,909 --> 00:17:04,450
you're not sizing correctly or you know

413
00:17:01,419 --> 00:17:08,200
not using basically the right stuff so

414
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:11,709
the next question then be for grant so

415
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:13,299
grant first you didn't in your over you

416
00:17:11,709 --> 00:17:15,220
didn't tell everybody how big your farm

417
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:16,990
was so first first thing I want to do is

418
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:19,660
set it up with you tell everybody like

419
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:22,650
how large the farm is that this season

420
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:25,810
is is getting prepared to open then next

421
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:27,430
how you guys determined what equipment

422
00:17:25,809 --> 00:17:29,139
you were going to be using and what

423
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:30,610
priority you put to making those

424
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:33,670
determinations as you design your farm

425
00:17:30,609 --> 00:17:38,259
yeah certainly thanks for asking me

426
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:40,060
Chris so I have a better model on a

427
00:17:38,259 --> 00:17:42,549
slide in the panel that I'm on in about

428
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:45,909
30 minutes so so hopefully y'all don't

429
00:17:42,549 --> 00:17:47,829
get too sick of me until then so the

430
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:50,230
farm that we just finished is sixty

431
00:17:47,829 --> 00:17:52,480
thousand square feet it's in it's in

432
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:54,970
Pittsburgh it's in a historic town

433
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,680
called Braddock it's actually the town

434
00:17:54,970 --> 00:18:00,069
with the last remaining operating steel

435
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:02,680
mill in Pittsburgh it's a really

436
00:18:00,069 --> 00:18:05,829
interesting place so in that 60,000

437
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:08,670
square foot farm we have a 25,000 square

438
00:18:05,829 --> 00:18:11,529
feet from a footprint standpoint of of

439
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:14,410
biodome space and then that translates

440
00:18:11,529 --> 00:18:17,799
to 126 thousand square feet of growing

441
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:20,170
space so that's all of the arable space

442
00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:22,389
if you will of all of our stacked

443
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:26,890
methodology or all of our stacked

444
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:28,450
systems so that that's that's due to the

445
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:30,310
level of density that we can get from

446
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:34,509
from some of the automation that we have

447
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:38,319
built into the the bio dome so so so

448
00:18:34,509 --> 00:18:40,450
that's the size of the facility the the

449
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:42,069
initial we didn't enter this space from

450
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:43,360
a gross science standpoint we actually

451
00:18:42,069 --> 00:18:46,929
entered this space from an automation

452
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:48,490
standpoint so many of us have have

453
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:49,509
Carnegie Mellon roots we were not a

454
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:52,569
spin-out from Carnegie

455
00:18:49,509 --> 00:18:54,788
but we have it was kind of a dorm-room

456
00:18:52,569 --> 00:18:58,210
project if you will to say okay how can

457
00:18:54,788 --> 00:19:00,038
we use robotics to automate a growing

458
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:01,569
system and that started out as around

459
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:04,028
the size of this table and then over

460
00:19:01,569 --> 00:19:05,379
over three three years we kept we kept

461
00:19:04,028 --> 00:19:07,929
saying okay how do we how do we think

462
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:10,870
about moving the plants around the

463
00:19:07,929 --> 00:19:14,950
system to get to to get to automated

464
00:19:10,869 --> 00:19:16,000
workstations and then it was and then it

465
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:18,278
was it was really taking that

466
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,950
methodology and expanding upon that so

467
00:19:18,278 --> 00:19:23,079
we used a hydroponic system we have fill

468
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:26,190
and drain trays and then those trays are

469
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:30,009
moved around the entire entire growing

470
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:31,600
operation via variety of connected

471
00:19:30,009 --> 00:19:33,609
automation tools some some of it is

472
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:35,709
off-the-shelf that we've augmented with

473
00:19:33,609 --> 00:19:37,479
with our own software and our own

474
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:38,860
hardware software hardware integration

475
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:42,069
and some of it is stuff that we've

476
00:19:38,859 --> 00:19:44,138
proprietary fabricated for ourselves and

477
00:19:42,069 --> 00:19:45,700
then Sam kind of the same question

478
00:19:44,138 --> 00:19:48,038
towards you you know for you guys when

479
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:49,750
you looked at you know the crops you're

480
00:19:48,038 --> 00:19:52,359
growing or as you're building your

481
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:54,638
business model we're did the HVAC

482
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:56,918
lighting conversation ranked in terms of

483
00:19:54,638 --> 00:20:01,209
importance to you guys as something to

484
00:19:56,919 --> 00:20:03,278
solve you know as a priority you know I

485
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:05,259
think early on we knew that you know

486
00:20:03,278 --> 00:20:08,109
lighting and HVAC we're going to be big

487
00:20:05,259 --> 00:20:09,129
priorities and I think you know

488
00:20:08,109 --> 00:20:12,069
certainly they're they're very much

489
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:14,169
related obviously you know the the

490
00:20:12,069 --> 00:20:16,928
efficiency of the LEDs there's a direct

491
00:20:14,169 --> 00:20:18,850
impact on what HVAC systems you you're

492
00:20:16,929 --> 00:20:20,950
putting in and and obviously all that's

493
00:20:18,849 --> 00:20:22,269
a function of what you're growing and

494
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:23,740
how quickly it's growing and

495
00:20:22,269 --> 00:20:28,240
transpiration rates and things like that

496
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:31,778
so it was very much a top top of mind I

497
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:33,638
think when we first set out we probably

498
00:20:31,778 --> 00:20:36,638
underestimated like many what was going

499
00:20:33,638 --> 00:20:38,439
to be needed from an HVAC standpoint

500
00:20:36,638 --> 00:20:41,439
particularly on dehumidification you

501
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:44,259
know to looking back to 2013 2014 but

502
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:47,350
we've obviously been growing quite a bit

503
00:20:44,259 --> 00:20:51,730
since then and our our next facility

504
00:20:47,349 --> 00:20:55,869
which will be about 140,000 square feet

505
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:58,269
of floor space but probably the

506
00:20:55,869 --> 00:21:03,039
production equivalent you know if you

507
00:20:58,269 --> 00:21:06,690
take will have about two acres of actual

508
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:09,279
growing area that'll be the equivalent

509
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:11,110
roughly the equivalent Wondra acres of

510
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:15,009
farmland in terms of production volume

511
00:21:11,109 --> 00:21:16,689
so that one that that facility in

512
00:21:15,009 --> 00:21:19,180
particular we're taking a completely

513
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:21,160
different approach on the the kind of

514
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:23,769
the critical infrastructure side of

515
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:27,009
what's needed and then yesterday in a

516
00:21:23,769 --> 00:21:28,809
panel discussion we heard that times of

517
00:21:27,009 --> 00:21:30,819
the year in terms of the markets you

518
00:21:28,809 --> 00:21:32,409
know what what you can potentially get

519
00:21:30,819 --> 00:21:34,089
at market for your product

520
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:37,810
we heard that times of the year impacted

521
00:21:34,089 --> 00:21:39,339
growing decisions how has how has those

522
00:21:37,809 --> 00:21:41,950
how have those sorts of very very

523
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:45,059
variables impacted arrow farms as

524
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:49,600
growing decisions or crop selections

525
00:21:45,059 --> 00:21:52,269
yeah I mean we you know our business

526
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:54,069
plan is to essentially be a price taker

527
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:55,930
in the market and that's something that

528
00:21:54,069 --> 00:21:57,819
we're striving for so we want to be

529
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:59,500
growing at a cost structure that's

530
00:21:57,819 --> 00:22:02,529
competitive with the field farms in

531
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:05,259
California and in doing so you know

532
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:07,089
really be in a position where we can

533
00:22:05,259 --> 00:22:09,460
take the price that's given to us

534
00:22:07,089 --> 00:22:10,959
obviously that's somewhat aspirational

535
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:12,309
in certain instances we have been doing

536
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:15,069
that in other instances it's been more

537
00:22:12,309 --> 00:22:17,039
of a struggle but that is the goal and

538
00:22:15,069 --> 00:22:20,759
that is I think the goal of this

539
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:24,159
industry in general is not just to

540
00:22:20,759 --> 00:22:26,769
produce with less inputs but to produce

541
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:30,279
economically with less inputs than field

542
00:22:26,769 --> 00:22:31,450
farming so so I think the kind of answer

543
00:22:30,279 --> 00:22:33,399
is your question I mean we have seen

544
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:35,289
some seasonal variability in terms of

545
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:37,240
order volumes things like that but

546
00:22:35,289 --> 00:22:39,430
generally you know since we're selling

547
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:42,400
into such a large market for for leafy

548
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:44,080
greens and in particular that hasn't

549
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,880
really affected us as much as it might

550
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:48,789
be affecting some of the larger growers

551
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:51,160
right now okay and then Javeed a crop

552
00:22:48,789 --> 00:22:53,109
question for you in the majority of

553
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:54,580
projects we see around the country and

554
00:22:53,109 --> 00:22:57,069
really around the world are focused on

555
00:22:54,579 --> 00:22:59,139
leafy greens and culinary herbs can you

556
00:22:57,069 --> 00:23:01,059
have any examples of other crops that

557
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:03,280
are doing well in a completely lit

558
00:23:01,059 --> 00:23:05,919
environment sure

559
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:08,859
so strawberries are kind of the the next

560
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:10,570
big crop that a lot of CA growers are

561
00:23:08,859 --> 00:23:13,929
looking to produce in vertical farms

562
00:23:10,569 --> 00:23:14,649
specifically there's a company in New

563
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:16,450
Jersey called

564
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:18,610
we she farms

565
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:20,140
that is now growing strawberries and

566
00:23:18,609 --> 00:23:22,659
distributing them to Michelin star

567
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:25,930
restaurants in New York City they cost

568
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:26,580
about $50 a pound there they're very

569
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:30,759
expensive

570
00:23:26,579 --> 00:23:33,549
supposedly delicious they are served as

571
00:23:30,759 --> 00:23:35,230
a plating in one of the you know

572
00:23:33,549 --> 00:23:37,480
multiple courses that you'd receive at

573
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:38,970
this restaurant and as one of the plates

574
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:42,279
you get two of these strawberries

575
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:45,160
nothing else so you can see the kind of

576
00:23:42,279 --> 00:23:47,710
markets that these products are getting

577
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:51,460
into especially on the on the culinary

578
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:53,319
herbs and niche crop side but we we

579
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:56,819
caution our clients about this these

580
00:23:53,319 --> 00:23:59,200
markets because the size is limited and

581
00:23:56,819 --> 00:24:02,200
you can over saturate those markets

582
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:04,660
pretty quickly and there are a lot of

583
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:06,789
big players in the Dutch Adric

584
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:08,890
agriculture industry that have focused

585
00:24:06,789 --> 00:24:11,740
on these markets and are paying more

586
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:13,660
attention to it in the United States an

587
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:17,620
example of that is the New York City

588
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:20,140
microgreens market which is is largely

589
00:24:17,619 --> 00:24:22,719
controlled by a Dutch microgreens

590
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:25,630
producer that produces very cheaply in a

591
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:27,039
greenhouse on Long Island so they they

592
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:28,840
compete with all of the smaller

593
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:31,480
microgreens producers in New York City

594
00:24:28,839 --> 00:24:34,269
and it's hard to build a kind of a

595
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:37,210
capital raise around a market when you

596
00:24:34,269 --> 00:24:39,309
have or a limited market size when you

597
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:41,170
have very big players get kind of

598
00:24:39,309 --> 00:24:43,149
stepping into the ring with very low

599
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:45,310
cost of production and we've seen

600
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:48,190
investors shy away from those niche

601
00:24:45,309 --> 00:24:49,929
markets for that reason and then this

602
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:54,519
question I'm gonna give to either grant

603
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:55,779
or Sam how have your decisions or the

604
00:24:54,519 --> 00:24:58,599
decisions you've made around energy

605
00:24:55,779 --> 00:25:00,460
purchases right how have your technology

606
00:24:58,599 --> 00:25:02,679
partners played a role in that

607
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:04,480
whether it be I know grant you guys have

608
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:06,039
micro-grid partner I know you guys are

609
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,930
working with Dell and some other groups

610
00:25:06,039 --> 00:25:09,309
like that have you really you know how

611
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:10,630
how much do you rely on those

612
00:25:09,309 --> 00:25:12,609
relationships with the tech partners

613
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:16,870
versus how much of the stuff do you work

614
00:25:12,609 --> 00:25:19,240
on in-house oh maybe go first and try

615
00:25:16,869 --> 00:25:21,089
and try and keep it short so I mean the

616
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:24,160
the partnerships in this space are huge

617
00:25:21,089 --> 00:25:25,559
so you especially when you think about

618
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:28,950
when you think about energy it

619
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:30,389
our largest cost items so when you when

620
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:32,160
you think about the great math problem

621
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:33,930
that's how we often talk about it

622
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:35,640
internally and externally it's all about

623
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:37,110
trying to make the economics work I

624
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:38,520
think Sam hit the nail on the head we

625
00:25:37,109 --> 00:25:39,839
all want to be price takers in this

626
00:25:38,519 --> 00:25:41,940
market that's the only way we're going

627
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:43,859
to be able to to really start to move

628
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:46,289
the needle in terms of the product that

629
00:25:43,859 --> 00:25:49,829
comes out of out of California so the

630
00:25:46,289 --> 00:25:52,559
the technical knowledge of how different

631
00:25:49,829 --> 00:25:55,019
energy solutions can integrate within a

632
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:57,299
system is just not something that that

633
00:25:55,019 --> 00:26:00,750
we have both had the time to do because

634
00:25:57,299 --> 00:26:02,639
that would take us probably I don't know

635
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:05,400
20 years to build the perfect farm on

636
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:07,590
our own or its it and it's something

637
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:09,960
that when we we need to connect

638
00:26:07,589 --> 00:26:12,029
information points across we need the

639
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:13,799
expertise of external partners so if

640
00:26:12,029 --> 00:26:16,440
it's something such as such as our micro

641
00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:18,839
grid where that allows us to take our

642
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:21,029
internal energy usage and how we plan

643
00:26:18,839 --> 00:26:23,009
for energy usage on a daily basis based

644
00:26:21,029 --> 00:26:25,079
on what's in the biodome and we look at

645
00:26:23,009 --> 00:26:27,240
what's happening in the and from the

646
00:26:25,079 --> 00:26:29,460
grid and we try to we try to manage and

647
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:31,170
do curtailment as best as possible or if

648
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:33,620
it's if it's trying to even take a step

649
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:36,539
back and look at okay having having

650
00:26:33,619 --> 00:26:40,529
high-res high-resolution controls on our

651
00:26:36,539 --> 00:26:42,420
breakers looking at high resolution data

652
00:26:40,529 --> 00:26:43,980
analytics on on each of our panels and

653
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:46,440
trying to match that up with how our

654
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:47,940
HVAC is pulling pulling that together

655
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:49,500
and being able to bounce that off of

656
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:51,720
somebody who is an external partner and

657
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:53,250
say hey does this does this look right

658
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,420
for just just how I'm trying to

659
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:56,400
understand what the hell is going at

660
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:59,670
part of my language what's going on

661
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:01,710
that's huge because you know we're we're

662
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:03,120
a very small focused team we're trying

663
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:05,610
to get the highest quality plants out

664
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:12,079
and we really do rely on external

665
00:27:05,609 --> 00:27:14,399
partners very heavily so I think

666
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:16,230
certainly we rely on external partners

667
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,269
for some things I would say though a

668
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:20,220
very high level like arrow farms were

669
00:27:18,269 --> 00:27:23,129
where our own technology partner and

670
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:25,529
that we have a technology that we built

671
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:28,620
out obviously in conjunction with many

672
00:27:25,529 --> 00:27:31,259
other players but we have a technology

673
00:27:28,619 --> 00:27:34,709
that we're looking to deploy across the

674
00:27:31,259 --> 00:27:36,509
globe and the site selection where you

675
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:39,298
actually deploy that technology can

676
00:27:36,509 --> 00:27:40,528
solve a lot of the questions and

677
00:27:39,298 --> 00:27:43,730
it's for the same reason why you have

678
00:27:40,528 --> 00:27:47,128
farms in California you may have farms

679
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:49,200
that are located next to utilities where

680
00:27:47,128 --> 00:27:51,238
you get a lower cost structure or have

681
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,619
certain infrastructure in place you know

682
00:27:51,239 --> 00:27:54,600
there's a reason why farms are in

683
00:27:52,618 --> 00:27:56,609
California and it's because they can

684
00:27:54,599 --> 00:27:58,319
produce with a with a low cost structure

685
00:27:56,609 --> 00:28:00,479
and that's a function of a lot of

686
00:27:58,319 --> 00:28:02,999
different factors but now there's new

687
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:05,308
technology and those that new technology

688
00:28:02,999 --> 00:28:07,618
is now going to be implemented across

689
00:28:05,308 --> 00:28:09,839
the globe and that will be done in

690
00:28:07,618 --> 00:28:12,949
conjunction with site-specific factors

691
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:16,048
and I think that can go a long way at

692
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:17,538
mitigating a lot of the costs so it's a

693
00:28:16,048 --> 00:28:20,190
little bit of a different way to answer

694
00:28:17,538 --> 00:28:21,960
and then one final question before we

695
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:24,749
open it up to the audience for for

696
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:26,220
questions I'm gonna put this house to

697
00:28:24,749 --> 00:28:29,730
all three of you because it might be

698
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:32,038
slightly sensitive information are any

699
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:34,528
can any of you answer the question what

700
00:28:32,038 --> 00:28:36,599
percentage of your cost of goods and

701
00:28:34,528 --> 00:28:39,450
material does utilities makeup so

702
00:28:36,599 --> 00:28:41,158
another way to ask that is how much on a

703
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:45,808
per pound basis what percentage is

704
00:28:41,159 --> 00:28:48,799
utilities or whatever whatever metric

705
00:28:45,808 --> 00:28:51,599
you are comfortable using or sharing

706
00:28:48,798 --> 00:28:53,908
yeah I'll take a swing at trying to

707
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:56,278
answer that it kind of depends on the

708
00:28:53,909 --> 00:28:59,039
crop because not all crops take the same

709
00:28:56,278 --> 00:29:02,460
amount of usage and that if you as you

710
00:28:59,038 --> 00:29:04,079
think about the everything going on in

711
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:06,179
the biodome you have a mix of crops

712
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:07,769
that's that's also gonna going to add

713
00:29:06,179 --> 00:29:10,590
into something else from what we found

714
00:29:07,769 --> 00:29:13,038
it's anywhere between thirty to fifty

715
00:29:10,589 --> 00:29:14,730
percent in terms of what our cost is

716
00:29:13,038 --> 00:29:17,278
javi do you have anything to add to that

717
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:20,128
yeah I would say it depends a lot on the

718
00:29:17,278 --> 00:29:23,339
system type the crop definitely plays a

719
00:29:20,128 --> 00:29:26,459
role in that but also I mean when we

720
00:29:23,339 --> 00:29:29,428
when we look at a greenhouse that has no

721
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:32,340
supplemental lighting your your energy

722
00:29:29,429 --> 00:29:34,679
use can be very very low and then your

723
00:29:32,339 --> 00:29:37,048
labor will be the higher cost component

724
00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:38,869
almost across the board we see labor as

725
00:29:37,048 --> 00:29:41,759
the the biggest cost for these farms

726
00:29:38,868 --> 00:29:44,689
utilities does hover around 30 to 50

727
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:46,400
percent usually but then that can grow

728
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:48,980
if you have a highly automated farm that

729
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:50,690
uses you know a lot of mechanization and

730
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:53,720
automation instead of that labor

731
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:59,330
component Sam do you want to add

732
00:29:53,720 --> 00:30:01,250
anything or okay all right

733
00:29:59,329 --> 00:30:02,929
with that being said I think we have now

734
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:06,470
have some time for some questions so

735
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:07,970
I'll turn it to the audience in an

736
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:10,880
earlier panel we talked about how the

737
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:12,589
energy consumption of a farm or facility

738
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,540
is not necessarily the greatest

739
00:30:12,589 --> 00:30:16,699
contributor to the carbon impact it's

740
00:30:14,539 --> 00:30:19,369
often the fuel mix and so I was just

741
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:21,470
curious if you could both were in all

742
00:30:19,369 --> 00:30:23,869
three of you comment on what you've been

743
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:26,000
seeing in terms of your own facility the

744
00:30:23,869 --> 00:30:28,669
mix between electrical consumption and

745
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:31,460
other whether that's natural gas

746
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:38,360
delivered fuels on-site thermal

747
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:40,549
renewable generators etc yeah from a so

748
00:30:38,359 --> 00:30:43,069
I can't comment on the total carbon

749
00:30:40,549 --> 00:30:45,079
impact we just finished the farm and

750
00:30:43,069 --> 00:30:47,539
where we're literally firing it up to

751
00:30:45,079 --> 00:30:50,089
have have crops on shelves in the next

752
00:30:47,539 --> 00:30:53,329
30 days so that's something that we hope

753
00:30:50,089 --> 00:30:55,899
to be able to share and be in be open

754
00:30:53,329 --> 00:30:59,359
about very soon we do have natural gas

755
00:30:55,900 --> 00:31:01,730
that comes into the micro grid too into

756
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:03,319
a standby dispatchable generator and

757
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:06,339
then we have salt we have solar on our

758
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:08,869
roof as well so you hope to offset that

759
00:31:06,339 --> 00:31:10,849
how much that that will actually take

760
00:31:08,869 --> 00:31:12,259
over time as we think about ramping up

761
00:31:10,849 --> 00:31:17,779
to production we want to we want to

762
00:31:12,259 --> 00:31:20,750
publish actuals once we have them so I

763
00:31:17,779 --> 00:31:22,160
think micro grids are definitely a great

764
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:24,109
and I think there's a panel on those

765
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:27,290
later today a great opportunity for the

766
00:31:24,109 --> 00:31:31,159
sector in certain instances particularly

767
00:31:27,289 --> 00:31:32,690
where you have higher energy costs you

768
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:35,870
know I think there that the challenge is

769
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:39,080
you need something like 20 times the

770
00:31:35,869 --> 00:31:40,789
square footage in terms of panels of

771
00:31:39,079 --> 00:31:42,829
what you would need just for your

772
00:31:40,789 --> 00:31:44,180
consumption during peak hours of the day

773
00:31:42,829 --> 00:31:47,210
and then you need all the batteries and

774
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:50,000
everything else so it's it's huge you

775
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:51,740
know that would dramatically impact your

776
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,990
site selection right so now all of a

777
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:56,930
sudden you're you're looking for you

778
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:58,490
know two million square feet versus you

779
00:31:56,930 --> 00:32:01,850
know a hundred thousand square feet

780
00:31:58,490 --> 00:32:05,599
of space it dramatically changes that

781
00:32:01,849 --> 00:32:09,259
assessment so it's a challenge but it's

782
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:11,689
not to say that it it can't be can't be

783
00:32:09,259 --> 00:32:13,369
addressed I mean we we located

784
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:16,190
specifically our next farm will be in

785
00:32:13,369 --> 00:32:20,419
Virginia specifically because it had a

786
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:23,029
reliable grid had reliable inputs for

787
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:25,220
natural gas and for electricity and also

788
00:32:23,029 --> 00:32:29,329
that we felt the utility was making

789
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:32,079
efforts itself to diversify its

790
00:32:29,329 --> 00:32:34,369
portfolio and to move into renewables so

791
00:32:32,079 --> 00:32:36,349
you know it's a bit of a different

792
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:37,879
approach but you know certainly we want

793
00:32:36,349 --> 00:32:42,769
to be partnering with utilities where we

794
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:45,230
have a like-minded view in terms of the

795
00:32:42,769 --> 00:32:47,299
you know their carbon impact over over

796
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:51,860
the course of our of our farm operation

797
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:56,109
so you guys just sort of answer it

798
00:32:51,859 --> 00:33:00,079
Jim Pantaleo Sam grant Javed thank you

799
00:32:56,109 --> 00:33:01,490
so when we talk about either owning a

800
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:04,369
building or leasing a building it brings

801
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:06,740
a whole another question in with respect

802
00:33:04,369 --> 00:33:08,928
to how much you can go off-grid maybe

803
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:11,990
this is a question for you Javed what

804
00:33:08,929 --> 00:33:14,030
have you seen in terms of folks that

805
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:16,549
owned their buildings versus folks that

806
00:33:14,029 --> 00:33:18,170
lease their buildings and the reason I

807
00:33:16,549 --> 00:33:20,629
asked that is that I've been a part of

808
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:22,960
indoor farms where the buildings have

809
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:25,370
been owned and leased for the lease

810
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:26,450
building we wanted to put photovoltaics

811
00:33:25,369 --> 00:33:29,119
up on the roof

812
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:31,700
we could totally find with the owner but

813
00:33:29,119 --> 00:33:33,558
when we left they stayed so it didn't it

814
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:34,819
didn't really pan out with the other

815
00:33:33,558 --> 00:33:35,839
building of course we owned it and we

816
00:33:34,819 --> 00:33:38,359
could have done that but I'm just

817
00:33:35,839 --> 00:33:39,789
curious what your what you know about

818
00:33:38,359 --> 00:33:43,609
that thank you

819
00:33:39,789 --> 00:33:45,589
sure well I think a lot of it comes down

820
00:33:43,609 --> 00:33:47,740
to you know who owns the building and

821
00:33:45,589 --> 00:33:50,000
what they're gonna allow you to do I

822
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:51,410
would say in the planning stage it's

823
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,329
really important to look at the zoning

824
00:33:51,410 --> 00:33:57,200
in that particular area what that allows

825
00:33:53,329 --> 00:33:59,339
for and if you are planning on using you

826
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:01,798
know micro grid or

827
00:33:59,339 --> 00:34:05,449
you know other renewable energy tie-ins

828
00:34:01,798 --> 00:34:10,679
that you have the space for that so it's

829
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:12,990
it's it's difficult to provide a concise

830
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:14,849
answer for that but I would say it

831
00:34:12,989 --> 00:34:16,858
really just comes down to doing the due

832
00:34:14,849 --> 00:34:18,510
diligence beforehand and making sure

833
00:34:16,858 --> 00:34:20,639
that you can do those things before

834
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:24,200
you've invested either through a lease

835
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:24,200
or a purchase

836
00:34:26,358 --> 00:34:31,619
thank you very much gentlemen

837
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:33,720
a Gorillaz just did a study and

838
00:34:31,619 --> 00:34:36,720
obviously they do quite a bit of reports

839
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:39,088
I just wanted your comments on vertical

840
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:43,079
farming because the numbers in that

841
00:34:39,088 --> 00:34:45,628
particular study seem to be fairly high

842
00:34:43,079 --> 00:34:48,119
with regards to not being profitable in

843
00:34:45,628 --> 00:34:49,739
the vertical sight and I know you just

844
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:51,929
mentioned something about labor as well

845
00:34:49,739 --> 00:34:55,199
which I would expect with the cherry

846
00:34:51,929 --> 00:34:57,210
pickers and all that trying to do you

847
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:59,329
know vertical farming is gonna be a big

848
00:34:57,210 --> 00:35:01,769
challenge I'm just curious

849
00:34:59,329 --> 00:35:04,769
Jessica do you have a consensus amongst

850
00:35:01,769 --> 00:35:06,179
you of where do you think that's going

851
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:12,389
and how you may be able to make it more

852
00:35:06,179 --> 00:35:16,379
efficient yes so I think every project

853
00:35:12,389 --> 00:35:18,179
every farm is unique so I think there's

854
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:19,140
a lot of studies that are published in

855
00:35:18,179 --> 00:35:22,348
this space

856
00:35:19,139 --> 00:35:24,750
labor is often cited in them as as being

857
00:35:22,349 --> 00:35:27,480
a large cost but there are so many

858
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:29,670
factors that go into this very complex

859
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:32,460
it's not even complicated it's beyond

860
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:33,059
that complex math problem I mean what's

861
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:35,760
the rent

862
00:35:33,059 --> 00:35:36,929
what's the yield cycle what's the are

863
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:39,990
you doing one crop are you doing

864
00:35:36,929 --> 00:35:41,848
multiple crops you know what is the HVAC

865
00:35:39,989 --> 00:35:43,709
strategy there's all these factors that

866
00:35:41,849 --> 00:35:45,480
come together so I think it's I think

867
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:48,030
the vertical farming space in particular

868
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:51,050
has has has struggled because a lot of

869
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:53,460
people are still trying to approach the

870
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:55,619
validation or the the proven economics

871
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:58,470
from a research standpoint without

872
00:35:55,619 --> 00:36:01,349
really looking at kind of full

873
00:35:58,469 --> 00:36:03,179
production assumptions what I what I

874
00:36:01,349 --> 00:36:05,760
mean by that is is really looking at it

875
00:36:03,179 --> 00:36:07,289
from a okay huh how do you balance all

876
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:10,020
of these different work in process

877
00:36:07,289 --> 00:36:11,579
inventory inventory actuals and and also

878
00:36:10,019 --> 00:36:14,369
what's happening from a market

879
00:36:11,579 --> 00:36:17,068
from a marketing standpoint so I think

880
00:36:14,369 --> 00:36:19,170
it's definitely here to stay as an

881
00:36:17,068 --> 00:36:21,088
industry I think that there's enough

882
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:23,700
need for it I think that there's enough

883
00:36:21,088 --> 00:36:25,558
factors for it labor is is a component

884
00:36:23,699 --> 00:36:31,858
but it's just a component in a very very

885
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:34,109
complex problem and I think that's all

886
00:36:31,858 --> 00:36:36,778
right it is very complex but you know

887
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:38,009
we've been operating now you know the

888
00:36:36,778 --> 00:36:40,978
the vertical farm that I showed in the

889
00:36:38,009 --> 00:36:42,719
video for about three years we just as I

890
00:36:40,978 --> 00:36:44,639
mentioned that was designed about five

891
00:36:42,719 --> 00:36:48,450
years ago when we designed that it was

892
00:36:44,639 --> 00:36:51,239
to prove out certain KPIs and we as a

893
00:36:48,449 --> 00:36:54,268
company have consistently hit those KPIs

894
00:36:51,239 --> 00:36:56,190
and now feel confident that future

895
00:36:54,268 --> 00:36:59,939
build-outs will get the unit economics

896
00:36:56,190 --> 00:37:03,358
that we need so you know in short you

897
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:05,009
know obviously we didn't we this was so

898
00:37:03,358 --> 00:37:06,869
new when we were setting out to do it

899
00:37:05,009 --> 00:37:09,449
and still extremely new this this

900
00:37:06,869 --> 00:37:12,509
industry is in its infancy we were kind

901
00:37:09,449 --> 00:37:13,949
of triaging risk and we really built the

902
00:37:12,509 --> 00:37:15,719
facility around I would say more like

903
00:37:13,949 --> 00:37:17,608
flexibility because we didn't know

904
00:37:15,719 --> 00:37:19,108
exactly what we needed we didn't know

905
00:37:17,608 --> 00:37:21,179
exactly what automation was going to be

906
00:37:19,108 --> 00:37:22,440
needed we didn't know exactly what you

907
00:37:21,179 --> 00:37:23,568
know critical infrastructure was gonna

908
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:27,298
be needed so we built it around

909
00:37:23,568 --> 00:37:30,538
flexibility so that we could hit the

910
00:37:27,298 --> 00:37:32,458
KPIs that we needed to hit and you know

911
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:36,690
having de-risked you know essentially

912
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:39,478
the ability to scale these vertical

913
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:42,719
farms you know the economies of scale in

914
00:37:39,478 --> 00:37:44,218
conjunction with those KPIs we feel you

915
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:48,298
know confident we're gonna be building a

916
00:37:44,219 --> 00:37:50,880
much much larger you know improved

917
00:37:48,298 --> 00:37:53,099
design of that you know in Virginia so I

918
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:55,858
think that that says something obviously

919
00:37:53,099 --> 00:37:58,528
every technology is different

920
00:37:55,858 --> 00:37:59,940
what profitability means is different to

921
00:37:58,528 --> 00:38:01,199
different parties I mean there's a lot

922
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:04,769
of different ways to kind of look at it

923
00:38:01,199 --> 00:38:06,989
but but you know I think I agree this

924
00:38:04,768 --> 00:38:11,068
this industry is is unquestionably here

925
00:38:06,989 --> 00:38:12,568
to stay there's a lot of tailwind I

926
00:38:11,068 --> 00:38:14,190
think in the industry as well to kind of

927
00:38:12,568 --> 00:38:17,449
keep driving we just talked about led

928
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:19,650
efficiency and efficacy there's a lot of

929
00:38:17,449 --> 00:38:22,259
improvements that are kind of coming

930
00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:24,800
down the pipe so and I just add one more

931
00:38:22,259 --> 00:38:27,050
thing to that is that there are profit

932
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:30,500
vertical farms out there but what did

933
00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:32,420
some what both all the answers up here

934
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:34,579
touch on a couple of things what is

935
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:37,039
profit that means a lot to different

936
00:38:34,579 --> 00:38:39,079
people so what you'll see right now in

937
00:38:37,039 --> 00:38:40,940
food production in the vertical farming

938
00:38:39,079 --> 00:38:43,670
industry oftentimes the smaller farms

939
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:46,190
can turn a profit but they're usually

940
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:48,019
bootstrapped and profit his measured

941
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:49,550
maybe differently than somebody who's

942
00:38:48,019 --> 00:38:52,400
out doing a large capital raise and

943
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:53,510
building a mega vertical farm so it's

944
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,980
variant that I think that that was a

945
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:57,530
great answer I'd like to see if Chevy

946
00:38:54,980 --> 00:39:00,409
had anything else to add sure yeah what

947
00:38:57,530 --> 00:39:03,110
we've seen a lot is entrepreneurs

948
00:39:00,409 --> 00:39:05,629
building their businesses in kind of a

949
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:07,640
step function where they won't set out

950
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:08,840
with positive unit economics they'll

951
00:39:07,639 --> 00:39:11,119
understand that they're going to be

952
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:12,860
operating at a negative margin for maybe

953
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:15,679
a couple of years and while they build

954
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:17,780
their brand and then basically take up

955
00:39:15,679 --> 00:39:19,549
shelf space and then they can leverage

956
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:20,990
that shelf space for investment in

957
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:22,880
further rounds and provide their

958
00:39:20,989 --> 00:39:25,069
investors with a roadmap of how they're

959
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:28,369
going to lower those unit economics and

960
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:30,380
achieve profitability in the future sure

961
00:39:28,369 --> 00:39:31,670
yeah everybody's going after that

962
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:34,849
because it's kind of the low-hanging

963
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:38,210
fruit of the industry it's you know

964
00:39:34,849 --> 00:39:40,069
microgreens smaller baby greens they

965
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:42,619
have lower light lighting requirements

966
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:45,260
compared to other crops so you can

967
00:39:42,619 --> 00:39:48,380
manage those heat loads more affordably

968
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:51,700
and there's a lot of you know existing

969
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:55,010
standardized automation and Meccan it

970
00:39:51,699 --> 00:39:56,599
mechanization systems that are often

971
00:39:55,010 --> 00:39:58,760
borrowed from the Dutch horticulture

972
00:39:56,599 --> 00:40:01,909
industry that are then used in this

973
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:04,220
industry to reduce that labor cost but

974
00:40:01,909 --> 00:40:06,379
as the market expands into other higher

975
00:40:04,219 --> 00:40:08,509
value crops we see the labor

976
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:11,119
become an issue again with things like

977
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:13,070
strawberries where you know if you're

978
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:14,869
not operating on a size of farm large

979
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:18,289
enough you can't use natural pollinators

980
00:40:14,869 --> 00:40:20,869
you have to hand pollinate or you know

981
00:40:18,289 --> 00:40:22,730
do some other method for pollination and

982
00:40:20,869 --> 00:40:25,670
that becomes very cost

983
00:40:22,730 --> 00:40:28,490
costly again so it depends on the crop

984
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:30,990
as well as the size of your operation

985
00:40:28,489 --> 00:40:33,808
yeah dad one more thing to that at urban

986
00:40:30,989 --> 00:40:36,269
AG news we we look at three variables

987
00:40:33,809 --> 00:40:37,740
and there's a lot of inputs that go into

988
00:40:36,269 --> 00:40:39,449
these three variables if you think

989
00:40:37,739 --> 00:40:42,598
currently if you think about light

990
00:40:39,449 --> 00:40:45,808
intensity you think about plant density

991
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:47,430
and you think about crop cycle and you

992
00:40:45,809 --> 00:40:50,339
look at the variables that make up those

993
00:40:47,429 --> 00:40:56,848
three are those three measurables you'll

994
00:40:50,338 --> 00:40:59,279
find profit I um I was curious if you

995
00:40:56,849 --> 00:41:00,838
could talk about the commissioning

996
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:03,869
process whether that you perform

997
00:41:00,838 --> 00:41:05,789
yourself or whether that you had a

998
00:41:03,869 --> 00:41:07,710
partner performed for your facilities

999
00:41:05,789 --> 00:41:10,619
either when you were newly constructing

1000
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:12,449
in your existing building and then Sam

1001
00:41:10,619 --> 00:41:22,430
if you have plans for commissioning for

1002
00:41:12,449 --> 00:41:24,899
your new facility yes so we we built new

1003
00:41:22,429 --> 00:41:27,000
everything was was built from the ground

1004
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:32,130
up we laid the concrete pad everything

1005
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:33,539
else so there's there's kind of HVAC

1006
00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:36,410
commissioning when you think about that

1007
00:41:33,539 --> 00:41:39,029
there's there's light turn on literally

1008
00:41:36,409 --> 00:41:41,009
so so that's all a lot of things is

1009
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:42,359
packaging commissioning so some of that

1010
00:41:41,010 --> 00:41:44,309
stuff we've worked with partners where

1011
00:41:42,358 --> 00:41:46,828
we've bought technology off-the-shelf

1012
00:41:44,309 --> 00:41:49,079
but I mean from a full systems

1013
00:41:46,829 --> 00:41:50,970
integration standpoint I mean that's

1014
00:41:49,079 --> 00:41:53,068
really proprietary to us and I would I

1015
00:41:50,969 --> 00:41:54,509
would I think within this industry it's

1016
00:41:53,068 --> 00:41:56,608
pretty much proprietary to everybody

1017
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:59,460
so it's really how you bring all of

1018
00:41:56,608 --> 00:42:00,900
these pieces together that that's that's

1019
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:03,170
really the real challenge so we have a

1020
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:05,880
full full kind of commissioning turn on

1021
00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:09,150
turn on plan with that that we are at

1022
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:10,890
the tail end of now and so that was

1023
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:12,298
something again back to Chris's earlier

1024
00:42:10,889 --> 00:42:15,239
point that was something that we worked

1025
00:42:12,298 --> 00:42:16,980
on with external parties so our

1026
00:42:15,239 --> 00:42:19,108
relationship with our utility has been

1027
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:21,659
fantastic they've been really close

1028
00:42:19,108 --> 00:42:24,779
since we went from dorm room project to

1029
00:42:21,659 --> 00:42:28,318
visionary mega farm we included them

1030
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:31,769
from day one so that was that planning

1031
00:42:28,318 --> 00:42:33,420
process we we worked hard out probably a

1032
00:42:31,769 --> 00:42:34,889
year and a half ago in terms of hey what

1033
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:36,900
is this actual commissioning schedule

1034
00:42:34,889 --> 00:42:39,299
ramped up gonna look like and we saw

1035
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:41,820
we've seen really big dividends

1036
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:45,480
making sure that everything was was was

1037
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:47,820
really just just well articulated and we

1038
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:54,360
feel lucky that we we actually did that

1039
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:56,210
piece successfully I mean I agree that

1040
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:58,500
the commissioning is definitely

1041
00:42:56,210 --> 00:43:00,150
proprietary how you kind of integrate

1042
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:03,869
all the systems I will say one thing

1043
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:05,639
that that you should distress with these

1044
00:43:03,869 --> 00:43:07,230
types of systems is there's there's a

1045
00:43:05,639 --> 00:43:10,710
real estate component and then there's

1046
00:43:07,230 --> 00:43:12,929
the kind of improvements to that real

1047
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:15,539
estate that needs to happen and then

1048
00:43:12,929 --> 00:43:18,210
there's the equipment itself and all of

1049
00:43:15,539 --> 00:43:20,159
that is a bit of a dance and the earlier

1050
00:43:18,210 --> 00:43:22,010
you have access to the building to

1051
00:43:20,159 --> 00:43:24,869
starting installing equipment the better

1052
00:43:22,010 --> 00:43:26,490
because it accelerates that time line so

1053
00:43:24,869 --> 00:43:28,949
I think from when we talk about like

1054
00:43:26,489 --> 00:43:32,129
permitting and early access and those

1055
00:43:28,949 --> 00:43:34,589
types of questions there really isn't a

1056
00:43:32,130 --> 00:43:38,369
playbook out there and we've had to work

1057
00:43:34,590 --> 00:43:40,920
directly you know with the permitting

1058
00:43:38,369 --> 00:43:42,839
offices and you know the relevant

1059
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:44,460
parties to get into the building sooner

1060
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:46,260
than maybe you normally would have and

1061
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:47,610
you know I think establishing some sort

1062
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:50,190
of a standard there would be a good

1063
00:43:47,610 --> 00:43:51,599
thing for the industry because hopefully

1064
00:43:50,190 --> 00:43:55,260
it'll be a good thing for the industry

1065
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:57,150
but getting early access to get that

1066
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:59,310
process going is important because

1067
00:43:57,150 --> 00:44:01,260
obviously these are expensive to build

1068
00:43:59,309 --> 00:44:04,230
out and the sooner you start growing and

1069
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:06,770
selling food the better we have time for

1070
00:44:04,230 --> 00:44:06,769
one more question

1071
00:44:10,130 --> 00:44:14,869
yeah go ahead I think that's an

1072
00:44:12,588 --> 00:44:19,038
important point Sam that you just made

1073
00:44:14,869 --> 00:44:21,440
to around these two so there's a lot of

1074
00:44:19,039 --> 00:44:23,210
activity in the cannabis realm so when

1075
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:24,318
you think about permitting when you

1076
00:44:23,210 --> 00:44:27,228
think about commissioning from that

1077
00:44:24,318 --> 00:44:29,690
standpoint you do have knowledge and

1078
00:44:27,228 --> 00:44:30,978
some utilities not certainly not all and

1079
00:44:29,690 --> 00:44:33,798
I think we've all been part of that

1080
00:44:30,978 --> 00:44:36,588
conversation here today over over the

1081
00:44:33,798 --> 00:44:41,179
past couple days a lot of our facilities

1082
00:44:36,588 --> 00:44:42,858
do have very proprietary controls so

1083
00:44:41,179 --> 00:44:44,509
when you think about panel boards where

1084
00:44:42,858 --> 00:44:47,119
those are placed how those are designed

1085
00:44:44,509 --> 00:44:49,998
how they're impacting certain production

1086
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:52,729
systems all of that is just going to be

1087
00:44:49,998 --> 00:44:57,048
unique to really any type of inspector

1088
00:44:52,728 --> 00:44:59,048
so it's it's it's for these size farms

1089
00:44:57,048 --> 00:45:02,449
it's it's something that's new and so

1090
00:44:59,048 --> 00:45:05,509
for a lot of utilities and a lot of a

1091
00:45:02,449 --> 00:45:07,548
lot of inspectors new is just new means

1092
00:45:05,509 --> 00:45:10,429
time it means time to understand it

1093
00:45:07,548 --> 00:45:14,329
means time to become familiar so making

1094
00:45:10,429 --> 00:45:16,429
them a bit of our I mean literally since

1095
00:45:14,329 --> 00:45:18,769
the first time we got we got initial

1096
00:45:16,429 --> 00:45:21,278
even almost napkin drawings was was what

1097
00:45:18,768 --> 00:45:27,468
we tried to do because it's it's a

1098
00:45:21,278 --> 00:45:28,789
certainly a unique situation all right

1099
00:45:27,469 --> 00:45:30,200
with that I'd like to thank the

1100
00:45:28,789 --> 00:45:30,690
panelists and thank everybody for your

1101
00:45:30,199 --> 00:45:32,960
attention

1102
00:45:30,690 --> 00:45:33,840
[Applause]

1103
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:37,889
