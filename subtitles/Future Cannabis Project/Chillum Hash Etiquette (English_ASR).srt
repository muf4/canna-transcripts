1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,730
but yeah the most ancient device that is

2
00:00:07,889 --> 00:00:14,939
known basically so we did a mixture

3
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:18,359
today of a little bit of tobacco and a

4
00:00:14,939 --> 00:00:22,410
hash made from Sun bolt Farms grown in

5
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:25,740
humble dry farmed sunshine Johnson yeah

6
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:28,890
so did the rebel moon for this and then

7
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:31,348
Craig from Alpine glow did the THC bomb

8
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:35,579
these are both regenerative farms which

9
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:38,429
for me and my data topped yield and THC

10
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:40,590
and cannabinoid content so it's a huge

11
00:00:38,429 --> 00:00:42,628
proof that you don't need inputs you

12
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:44,579
don't need chemicals and if you just

13
00:00:42,628 --> 00:00:51,119
work with nature you can produce the

14
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:57,989
most fire no sorry no commercial

15
00:00:51,119 --> 00:01:01,108
synthetic inverts sunshine she is in a

16
00:00:57,988 --> 00:01:03,780
very specific place where she can do dry

17
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:07,579
farming it's not the right farming that

18
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:10,109
define quality no she's she's into in

19
00:01:07,579 --> 00:01:13,408
osmosis with the place where she is

20
00:01:10,109 --> 00:01:17,609
going and she's using that ability to

21
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:24,570
limit totally the water input so that

22
00:01:17,609 --> 00:01:27,989
the plants have to kick into a defensive

23
00:01:24,569 --> 00:01:37,739
system and produce a lot of regime to

24
00:01:27,989 --> 00:01:40,859
protect from dehydration basically third

25
00:01:37,739 --> 00:01:45,179
this is the fourth year we're doing on

26
00:01:40,859 --> 00:01:47,219
the same exact spot but also to make

27
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:49,950
people kind of understand so it's a

28
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:52,349
flood zone that place floods every 50

29
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:54,030
years it's under water it's also right

30
00:01:52,349 --> 00:01:56,250
in between the Avenue of the Giants

31
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:58,170
which are some of the biggest plants and

32
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:00,239
the biggest respiratory they're

33
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:02,460
breathing all the time and they're

34
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:04,319
blowing they're blowing so much moisture

35
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:06,209
throughout that valley in the morning

36
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:10,139
that yes they're doing your watering for

37
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:12,509
you so it's not like people say oh how

38
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:12,839
can you grow plants without water it's

39
00:02:12,509 --> 00:02:19,620
not

40
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:21,840
without what's underneath the ground yes

41
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:23,219
so when you say what's average used for

42
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,170
cannabis you're really talking through

43
00:02:23,219 --> 00:02:27,229
your head because there's no average

44
00:02:25,169 --> 00:02:31,469
juice from that no it all depends

45
00:02:27,229 --> 00:02:33,810
depends on the long so she's got redwood

46
00:02:31,469 --> 00:02:36,568
air where I grow I have Doug Fir air

47
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:38,640
right Doug for an oak air and so I think

48
00:02:36,568 --> 00:02:41,310
that makes a difference so you're gonna

49
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:45,469
I love cold air pilot they're called una

50
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:48,870
caja like Hara Hara Mahadeva Bamboula

51
00:02:45,469 --> 00:02:51,659
butene yeah that was the first time it's

52
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:53,489
spirit you have so and this is a brand

53
00:02:51,659 --> 00:02:55,348
new chill I'm right down blessings on

54
00:02:53,489 --> 00:02:58,009
the children so here we go Thank You

55
00:02:55,348 --> 00:02:58,009
Frenchie Wow

56
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:25,199
was a big deal in India because when you

57
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:27,660
did they catch the Chilam to the to the

58
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:32,849
God there is a lot of awareness that

59
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:35,340
comes of what you do like that the panel

60
00:03:32,849 --> 00:03:41,099
last night we're talking about making

61
00:03:35,340 --> 00:04:03,750
the tea in India when you smoke it's a

62
00:03:41,099 --> 00:04:05,669
big deal normally the Chilam always goes

63
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:07,500
right and you pass with you right and

64
00:04:05,669 --> 00:04:10,259
you only take with your right hand

65
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:12,419
my friend she had her honor to me passed

66
00:04:10,259 --> 00:04:14,549
it this way and then you have to say

67
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:21,120
Kali Chilam which is the feminine energy

68
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:23,970
going to the left side but it's it was

69
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:34,379
all unsaid but he I realized he did it

70
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:42,050
and I realized why he did it to look at

71
00:04:34,379 --> 00:04:42,050
that stone children from Funko

72
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:46,979
I don't know the whole lineage of the

73
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:51,569
children thing it was there a Lorenzo -

74
00:04:46,978 --> 00:04:55,199

00:05:06,928 --> 00:05:11,568
friend of my best friend that that spent

81
00:05:09,988 --> 00:05:14,278

00:05:33,149 --> 00:05:40,348
the second year I stand my best friend

90
00:05:36,119 --> 00:05:43,289
to get some field as far away from the

91
00:05:40,348 --> 00:05:48,868
village as possible in in Milano Valley

92
00:05:43,288 --> 00:05:51,748
and and I want to do the jungle in touch

93
00:05:48,869 --> 00:05:54,629
and acting for three weeks alone when I

94
00:05:51,749 --> 00:05:58,169
came down I'd still night in - in Puglia

95
00:05:54,629 --> 00:06:03,689
with an Italian house and that Italian

96
00:05:58,168 --> 00:06:06,868
dude was burning chillin was burning

97
00:06:03,689 --> 00:06:09,110
chillin in in oven and in the morning

98
00:06:06,869 --> 00:06:13,379
and I didn't really understand how

99
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:16,769
special it was to share my own jungle I

100
00:06:13,379 --> 00:06:19,439
didn't get his I didn't understand the

101
00:06:16,769 --> 00:06:20,968
value people put into the chilly quality

102
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:23,129
of your children and the quality of your

103
00:06:20,968 --> 00:06:26,610
regime that defines the respect that you

104
00:06:23,129 --> 00:06:29,039
receive so because I cooked up my year

105
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:31,408
jungle all night long with him in the

106
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:33,688
morning if I can give me a Chilam but I

107
00:06:31,408 --> 00:06:36,538
didn't know that dude so when arriving

108
00:06:33,689 --> 00:06:38,338
Manny Calum and I walk my children with

109
00:06:36,538 --> 00:06:42,778
a bunch of Italians they look at me like

110
00:06:38,338 --> 00:06:46,678
I had fucking stole the kiss because

111
00:06:42,778 --> 00:06:49,139
that guy literally chants totally what

112
00:06:46,678 --> 00:06:56,998
Chilam was in India I may

113
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:59,728
you see a different type of clay you see

114
00:06:56,999 --> 00:07:02,009
different this is a very important part

115
00:06:59,728 --> 00:07:04,318
of any Chilam smoking you want to clean

116
00:07:02,009 --> 00:07:06,180
it right because that's another thing

117
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,800
they look at your children they pull up

118
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:09,900
the children's this Chilam clean is this

119
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,968
dude clean right isn't that right it's

120
00:07:09,899 --> 00:07:15,929
part of the ritual and so and also you

121
00:07:11,968 --> 00:07:18,300
look out I'll find the polishes inside

122
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:21,240
the children it doesn't to be like a

123
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:27,360
mirror but it's porous so it's going to

124
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:28,079
absorb a lot of the tar from it no it's

125
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,840
all clear

126
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:36,538
it's all clear over and over and two

127
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:39,568
three four different type of clay yeah

128
00:07:36,538 --> 00:07:42,628
it absorb yeah you want that absorption

129
00:07:39,569 --> 00:07:44,370
but see this is the high art this is the

130
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:45,360
high art of chillin making you see

131
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:47,490
because you can get these little

132
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,080
throwaway chillings all over the place

133
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:56,129
that are little tiny one to one or two

134
00:07:49,079 --> 00:08:10,370
people chill them so that's true that

135
00:07:56,129 --> 00:08:10,370
sort of status I suppose it's all about

136
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:18,419
don't give you that to smoke when they

137
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:23,550
look at your ash they don't know you you

138
00:08:18,418 --> 00:08:26,008
need maybe it's like when you don't

139
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:27,810
understand that the world respects that

140
00:08:26,009 --> 00:08:30,088
you receive it the Chilam you have in

141
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:34,259
your on and the quality of the resin you

142
00:08:30,088 --> 00:08:37,259
put in even 15-20 years old people in in

143
00:08:34,259 --> 00:08:39,088
India if you have the goods they're

144
00:08:37,259 --> 00:08:41,668
going to give you respect doesn't matter

145
00:08:39,089 --> 00:08:43,529
how long you've been in India if you

146
00:08:41,668 --> 00:08:46,620
don't have it they don't even give you

147
00:08:43,528 --> 00:08:48,539
the time of the day I swear it's not

148
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:51,750
very nice actually they are not really

149
00:08:48,539 --> 00:09:03,419
welcoming well it's the caste system

150
00:08:51,750 --> 00:09:07,490
yeah yeah you got it you got to earn

151
00:09:03,419 --> 00:09:07,490
your credits no question about it but

152
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:14,610
how hardcore is it to go up into the

153
00:09:11,789 --> 00:09:19,289
mountains like I've got lost there

154
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:24,568
before it's like leaving the cave for

155
00:09:19,289 --> 00:09:28,740
months two days walk the closest bus

156
00:09:24,568 --> 00:09:31,979
it's today's walk explain and you have

157
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:35,278
to bring all your shit and it's you have

158
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:38,009
to be crazy crazy crazy about raising

159
00:09:35,278 --> 00:09:38,669
quality to put yourselves with that type

160
00:09:38,009 --> 00:09:42,750
of shit

161
00:09:38,669 --> 00:09:45,299
then it's at the at before the winter if

162
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:48,990
you get stuck in mulana with the snow

163
00:09:45,299 --> 00:09:51,269
and there is one pass at 12,000 feet

164
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:54,810
when you have that pass and you have

165
00:09:51,269 --> 00:09:56,509
like a snow up to your your tight and

166

170
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:16,889
of it with such stepping back so far

173
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:34,179
in Nepal and I went from pokhara to

174

the way just making the road and at one

176
00:10:37,899 --> 00:10:41,230
point is like barefoot you're walking

177
00:10:39,669 --> 00:10:44,789
along this thing and you're just out of

178
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:44,789
the village and no one speaks English

179
00:10:56,009 --> 00:11:03,309

186
00:11:22,389 --> 00:11:26,679

187
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:30,100

189
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:36,089

193
00:11:40,089 --> 00:11:45,100
chanting and pouring tea it's up on top

194
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:47,439
of the hill there and then I went back a

195
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:50,889
year later but I went over land from

196
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:52,750
from Amsterdam right all the way up to

197
00:11:50,889 --> 00:11:55,269
Nepal again and then I had a house in

198
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:58,059
back of swayambhu and I stayed there for

199
00:11:55,269 --> 00:11:59,620
about three months there and every day

200
00:11:58,059 --> 00:12:05,139
around the temple you know around the

201

204
00:12:08,259 --> 00:12:13,838
seeking out that most rare extreme place

205
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:17,730
I was there just to be sitting in

206
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,730
painting and being meditating
