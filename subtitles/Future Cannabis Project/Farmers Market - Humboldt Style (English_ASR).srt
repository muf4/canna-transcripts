00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,039
[Music]

2
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,040
oh damn

3
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:16,359
oh yeah

4
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:30,960
a little green hats

5
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:30,960
eat

6
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,840
i know some varieties they like have

7
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:38,000
that food

8
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:42,600
quality that just like we just kind of

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,600
want to like eat some of it you know

10
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,559
so you live where i live in kovalev

11
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:53,759
round valley and mendocino county oh all

12
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:54,479
right

13
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:55,439
yeah

14
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:58,319
yeah

15
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:59,920
just like a few ridges over

16
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,000
yeah but it took a while to get here it

17
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:05,599
took a while to get here

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,799
yeah all back country roads

19
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:08,879
yeah

20
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:11,840
so what it introduced us to the lineup

21
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:15,199
that you brought um so most of these are

22
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:17,040
velvet perps crosses velvet perps is a

23
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,680
strain that i've been developing for the

24
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,640
past like eight or nine years now

25
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,040
um

26
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,879
which came from a family

27
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,520
strain that we've been working with for

28
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:29,839
a while

29
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:31,840
it's a very purple

30
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,240
distinguished

31
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,840
bud that and

32
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:37,519
it definitely pops out if you if you

33
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,118
look at it and see there's there's not

34
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:41,280
much bud that looks

35
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:43,359
like it you know

36
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,560
so it definitely gives you that eye

37
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:47,840
appeal

38
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:50,560
and it's pretty crystally and

39
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,320
and it smells really good so

40
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,840
yeah

41
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:59,758
so most of these are just uh crosses

42
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:01,280
of the velvet perps so i've crossed uh

43
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,718
i used the velvet perps and crossed it

44
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,799
with all the other varieties that i've

45
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:07,280
been developing too so i've been

46
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,599
breeding for the past like eight or 12

47
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,199
years now

48
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:13,439
and what do you like about the velvet

49
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:15,759
perps that you want to experiment with

50
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:18,079
in a bunch of different directions

51
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:22,239
i've found that it's very disease

52
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:25,280
resistant and resilient to like frost

53
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:28,239
and it's pretty good vigorous plants so

54
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:30,719
they get pretty good size

55
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,159
when it's trimmed all down the pounds

56
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:34,479
are like you know

57
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:35,598
this big they're very dense buds and

58
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:36,719
weighty

59
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:39,919
and

60
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:42,318
so it makes for a good production plant

61
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:45,119
so that's why i wanted to cross it into

62
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:46,159
all my other ones to make them stronger

63
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,680
and

64
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:50,719
you know just have more of a

65
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,719
uh

66
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:54,878
seed stock you know and can the guy

67
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:57,680
standing next to you try it absolutely

68
00:02:54,878 --> 00:03:00,799
yeah you want to try the velvet perps or

69
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,800
you want to try something else

70
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:06,560
what do you got that's kind of the most

71
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,560
uppity most uppity

72
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,599
uh

73
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:15,439
yeah

74
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:15,439
maybe a violet skywalker

75
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,759
the reason we crossed all these

76
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:31,919
varieties together with the velvet perps

77
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:33,120
is so we could have a velvet line so

78
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:35,119
because

79
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,719
we i found out that you know whenever we

80
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,360
have the velvet perps in a dispensary

81
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:39,680
it's

82
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,239
they always tell us that it's the like

83
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,760
number one seller that they've ever had

84
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,200
you know it flies off the shelf quicker

85
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:47,359
than anything else

86
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:50,318
it's a good problem to have yeah it's

87
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,319
it's it's a good problem

88
00:03:52,878 --> 00:03:58,079
so yeah it's a lower thc it's around

89
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,878
like 17 to 18.

90
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,040
so

91
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:02,479
for overall it's a good for everybody

92
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:05,519
you know if you don't want to get so

93
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:08,079
super baked but at the same time it's a

94
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,360
it's a good overall like day smoke and

95
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,319
night smoke

96
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,360
so

97
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:13,759
yeah

98
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:16,639
so this is the

99
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:18,399
velvet skywalker skywalker goo crossed

100
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,400
with the velvet perps

101
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:22,560
it was awesome

102
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:26,159
and you're growing in

103
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:29,839
the earth not even in pot like all in

104
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:33,040
the earth uh raised beds that we

105
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:35,119
sheet mulch and uh use just local manure

106
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,800
and our own manure that we produce on

107
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,959
the farm

108
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:42,560
so everything's in the ground

109
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:44,159
full sun out of greenhouses no plastic

110
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,079
grown under it on them

111
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,320
or over them

112
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:50,399
so everything's as natural as we can do

113
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:52,719
to produce

114
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:55,519
these beautiful plants so we try to grow

115
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,040
as large as we can

116
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:59,039
so

117
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,879
most of them so as large as you can how

118
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,759
many are do you have a plant limiter or

119
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:03,759
a can

120
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,439
it's a canopy limit we have two five

121
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,960
thousand square foot

122
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:09,279
of gardens but you like to grow big

123
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:11,439
plants yeah we like big plants so one

124
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:14,079
plant will go we'll grow one plant in a

125
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:16,478
nine by nine

126
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:18,639
area and what's the philosophy behind

127
00:05:16,478 --> 00:05:22,000
that because you don't do that

128
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:23,360
right i do you do grow as big as you can

129
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,439
okay

130
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,000
i mean that's pretty i we we've always

131
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:31,199
grown that way like just

132
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,600
um throughout regulations and uh you

133
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,038
know it's always been like oh only 25

134
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,039
plants so we've always just been trying

135
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:38,399
to maximize the biggest right yeah so

136
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:40,000
that's kind of where my question's going

137
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:42,239
which is now that you don't have that

138
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,839
like limit that you have to work around

139
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,800
are you growing it because you think

140
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:47,038
it's

141
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,600
the best plant or because it's like what

142
00:05:47,038 --> 00:05:52,000
you've done for what i've done and what

143
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,000
i know and what i love to do i like to

144
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,038
see the full expression of each plant

145
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,918
you know

146
00:05:55,038 --> 00:05:58,240
so

147
00:05:55,918 --> 00:05:59,279
having them out there for three full

148
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,478
season

149
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:02,559
full uh

150
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:04,000
you know cycles of of the season you

151
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,120
know like spring

152
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,199
summer and fall you know the plant is in

153
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,519
taking all the information from the

154
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:13,919
cosmos from the soil

155
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:15,758
you know producing all this beautiful

156
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:18,560
medicine you know so that's what we

157
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:21,439
really try to do is um you know make

158
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:23,038
real medicine so

159
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:24,160
that everybody can

160
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:25,038
enjoy

161
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,800
and

162
00:06:25,038 --> 00:06:28,240
get excited about you know that's what

163
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,360
it's about

164
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:35,360
so what are your initial expectations

165
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,360
me i'm super excited i love it

166
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:39,038
it's a quiet excitement

167
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,879
i'm gonna tell you the truth i i

168
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,120
actually haven't tried this this

169
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:48,879
cross yet i really i'm excited

170
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,478

crystals

215
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:54,480
well the crystals look so much more

216
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:57,919
against the purple background

217
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,920

00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,519
uh companies that we work with already

236
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,278
you know and

237
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,799
you know wherever it goes it's fine with

238
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:46,240
us as long as uh

they can

241
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:50,799
send it out but as long as they

242
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:53,278
reference like sun roots farm our name

243
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:55,278
on there we're good with that you know

244
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:57,600
we're not trying to like

245
00:09:55,278 --> 00:09:58,879
fill jars that are at our farm or

246
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,879
anything

247
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:03,600
it's too much work

248
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:06,480
we sell wholesale and that's it like

249
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,839
after that we're work we're good

250
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,920
what are your thoughts and what you just

251
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:11,760
smoked

252
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:14,078
that's great

253
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:15,838
it's it's wonderful no i'm just kind of

254
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:17,838
taking it in because there's this common

255
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,880
thing that's going on

256
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:22,079
in

257
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:24,000
all this all these crosses that like

258
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:25,599
that i really like that i haven't seen

259
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,159
in a long time

260
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,959
the the jagua totally makes sense that

261
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:33,360
that's it's bringing in that flavor like

262
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:35,599
for whatever reason in my circle that

263
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,120
just hasn't been around in i don't know

264
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,360
a decade or something

265
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,360
and

266
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:45,600
so that's that's super fun

267
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:47,200
i love dragoo is a local

268
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,519
strain to kovalev

269
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,480
my brother and his friend noel actually

270
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,000
uh

271
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,159
collaborated and

272
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,879
produced that one like i don't know

273
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:58,639
probably 15 years ago now

274
00:10:56,879 --> 00:11:00,159
and

275
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:02,480
throughout the years we've just been

276
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:05,360
breeding with certain phenotypes that

277
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:07,600
come out and selecting the ones that we

278
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:11,360
like

279
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:13,440
though we had this one seed stock that

280
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,200
each seed just came out totally

281
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,279
different like oh this one's a silver

282
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,360
goo this one's a strawberry this one's a

283
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:21,679
lemon all in the same

284
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,680
like cross but they had all these

285
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:25,359
different flavors it was yeah all the

286
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:26,719
expressions it was it was just like a

287
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:30,399
little

288
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:33,040
yeah it was amazing like those seeds

289
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:35,360
i wish i had some still i grew corn like

[Music]

296
00:11:48,029 --> 00:11:51,199
[Music]

297
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:55,360

298
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:58,958
flint corn this year it's really

299
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:01,120
beautiful corn oh yeah yeah yeah

300
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:03,679
this was a some heirloom strain i didn't

301
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,440
get the name of it

302
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:06,958
the main thing i was concerned is to go

303
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,639
work in my

304
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:13,518
normal climate yeah

305
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:16,879
this platinum velvet right here is

306
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:18,720
this is a one of my new favorite strains

307
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:20,399
that one just like

308
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,800
for the purple and then

309
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:26,879
it's got that you got those uh

310
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:26,879
almost like orange hairs and blue

311
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:38,000
let's see like in in there that is

312
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:40,800
like just the beach which the one we

313
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,799
were looking at was

314
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:44,399
that the one that just carried it all

315
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:45,599
the way through to the

316
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,120
the core

317
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,519
and what did you say the cross was on

318
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:54,000
this one this is a platinum diesel

319
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:56,320
crossed with the um velvet perps okay

320
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,200
what do you got going on

321
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:02,000
this is actually some lamb spread

322
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:04,079
that we uh

323
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,320
we got we've been

324
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:07,838
messing with it's like something i like

325
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,639
to delve into

326
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:11,519
more

327
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:13,200
uh as opposed to like kind of other

328
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:15,519
things that i

329
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,759
that i work with you know like

330
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:18,879
this that are a little bit more

331
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:21,360
you know

332
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:23,039
standard on the market it's cool to like

333
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,320
put something

334
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:26,559
out

335
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,560
uh

336
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:32,320
i don't know something that that's just

337
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:34,720
it's actually it's bringing

338
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,920
something much more unique to the market

339
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,399
and like

340
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:40,399
to see people actually consume something

341
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:41,440
like this that doesn't have the visual

342
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:44,799
appeal

343
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:46,959
of my other varieties and to like

344
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:50,399
to be like wow i wasn't expecting it to

345
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:52,719
be an actual experience that somehow

346
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:55,039
like that automatically it's gonna be

347
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:58,320
lesser than because it's not carrying

348
00:13:55,039 --> 00:14:00,480
these these visual appeals like

349
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,879
you know so

350
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:05,600
something like

351
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:08,480
this that just fall

352
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:10,159
like i just think it falls a lot more

353
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,159
i don't want to even say more flat but

354
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:14,799
it's just like i've consumed so many

355
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:17,360
variations of product like that in the

356
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:18,799
last five or ten years

357
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,879
that like

358
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:23,120
it's hard for me to really differentiate

359
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:25,198
it as like a new experience even though

360
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,320
if it has a new name

361
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:27,599
um

362
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,800
and like and these are all varieties

363
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,560
that are just coming into my life from

364
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:32,879
different directions different popular

365
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:34,958
things that are being bred and like to

366
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:36,720
come across something that

367
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:39,439
has fallen out of

368
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:41,278
favor a little bit or as uh

369
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,519
you know not not in production or

370
00:14:41,278 --> 00:14:45,919
circulation and be like oh my god this

371
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:47,759
truly is cool this actually has this

372
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:49,120
thing in some unique merit where all of

373
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:51,120
a sudden i want to

374
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:53,360
hold i'm not so i'm not so quick to just

375
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,198
like let it pass through my hands like

376
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:58,159
well every i think i feel like every

377
00:14:55,198 --> 00:15:00,799
like variety even if it's not like what

378
00:14:58,159 --> 00:15:03,759
you're saying as visually appealing it

379
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:07,198
definitely has its um benefits even if

380
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:09,039
it's you know it may not look so

381
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:10,879
you know

382
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:12,559
so

383
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:14,639
how do you get the public to appreciate

384
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:16,799
yeah right

385
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:19,680
when they're going after bag appeal

386
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:22,240
and jar appeal now right well yeah our

387
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:23,759
screen appeal or numbers i think yeah

388
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,480
number two testing

389
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:30,799
testing and like yeah when

390
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,800
those are hitting mid and high 20s

391
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:36,959
and this is not then that makes it

392
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,839
it's harder to get rid of

393
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:41,439
yeah or yeah even get people to

394
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:44,079
experience on a smaller level

395
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:46,959
versus yeah when i just give it away and

396
00:15:44,078 --> 00:15:49,359
share it with people that i love i get i

397
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:50,879
get to have that interaction in a way

398
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,800
that bringing

399
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:55,919
another

400
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:58,479
new popular varietal the people in my

401
00:15:55,919 --> 00:15:59,919
core center are bored

402
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,920
like

403
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:04,799
they're kind of like okay cool versus

404
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:07,759
when i like dabble into this other stuff

405
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:08,879
for my own enjoyment i see it around me

406
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:11,120
and like my

407
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:13,278
my group of people where they truly get

408
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,360
excited

409
00:16:13,278 --> 00:16:17,600
you're like they like the stuff i like

410
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,839
yeah or just ideas

411
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:22,000
even if it turns out that like okay this

412
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:24,160
one isn't my perfect thing at least it

413
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,480
was cool getting there because it was

414
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:26,480
different

415
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:35,040
that's what i've been that's what i've

416
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:35,039
been having a lot of fun with recently

417
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:39,759
[Music]

418
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,839
and what new kind of like experiments

419
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:43,199
are you doing on the farm

420
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:46,079
like what are you playing with whether

421
00:16:43,198 --> 00:16:47,599
it's like composting

422
00:16:46,078 --> 00:16:50,479
this next year i'm actually going to do

423
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:52,079
some direct sewing like in february

424
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,600
just pop some seeds out there right

425
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:54,799
where i plant

426
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,839
just

427
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:57,120
what

428
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:58,959
of what i'm gonna grow they're like

429
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,000
white water you know something something

430
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:02,239
like this

431
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,078
oh yeah okay oh i see instead of like

432
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,240
starting them in the greenhouse and blah

433
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:10,078
blah blah transplanting i wanted to see

434
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,078
whichever ones survived because i mean

435
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,360
i usually don't clone

436
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:15,199
cloak them like if you're going to put

437
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:16,558
them outside outside outside in february

438
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:18,480
you're just going to let them

439
00:17:16,558 --> 00:17:20,798
just let them do their thing because i

440
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:24,160
always like have volunteers coming up in

441
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:26,558
my garden and they do just fine you know

442
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:28,558
so if they're in the right place and i

443
00:17:26,558 --> 00:17:30,480
you know given the right care

444
00:17:28,558 --> 00:17:32,079
you know if it's going to be a crazy

445
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,440
storm i might go over there out there

446
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:35,519
and like cover them up with like a

447
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,600
little pot or something for the night

448
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:40,558
but you know i'm gonna

449
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:41,279
see how that um turns out because i feel

450
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:42,879
like

451
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:45,519
it might be a lot

452
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:47,120
better than doing all this extra work

453
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:49,279
transplanting

454
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:52,319
making soil to

455
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:56,000
start your seeds in you know all that so

456
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:58,879
just trying to um minimize

457
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,359
what is you know the impact and

458
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,720
the work because it's definitely a lot

459
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:05,119
to deal with

460
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:07,120
in the springtime philosophy and this

461
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:08,159
coming february is the first february

462
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:10,479
you're gonna do it

463
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:12,480
yeah i'm gonna try it that way

464
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,640
like in an ideal world just a whole

465
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,640
bunch of them like evenly spread out

466
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,559
around the property for like the yeah

467
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,559
i'll probably just like stick five or

468
00:18:18,558 --> 00:18:22,879
six seeds right where i want you know a

469
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:24,079
plant and then pick the best one you

470
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,320
know

471
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:28,319
so i like that

472
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:29,918
and then there's the whole thing too

473
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:32,000
with the tapper in the whole root system

474
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:34,000
that it just never has that weird

475
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,119
experience like

476
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,480
it's it's going for it like from day one

477
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:40,159
you put it in a pot and it's always

478
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,558
gonna get root bound you know no matter

479
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:44,798
what it is so

480
00:18:42,558 --> 00:18:47,519
unless you're like transplanting it when

481
00:18:44,798 --> 00:18:50,319
before it needs to be transplanted

482
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:52,000
which can work but it can happen

483
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:53,038
yeah you're always disturbing the roots

484
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,640
you know

485
00:18:53,038 --> 00:18:56,879
you transplant and then it has that

486
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:59,759
shock of being in new ground and being

487
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,840
outside so i just want to like

488
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:03,839
try to avoid all that does anyone know

489
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:05,439
any good bomb games we'll see how it

490
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:07,199
goes

491
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,320
yeah no totally

492
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,038
oh yeah

493
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:11,038
we got to do some

494
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,919
that's really interesting i want to

495
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:17,200
reach out to you again on like how

496
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:18,720
how the plant

497
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,840
seems like a trade-off right it's like

498
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,000
okay maybe it is going to be a little

499
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:22,959
bit rough in the beginning for the pen

500
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,640
but

501
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:27,279
it's well that'll make it more strong

502
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:29,679
yeah you know way so

503
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:31,038
yeah it'll make it more resilient to you

504
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:32,630
know everything else

505
00:19:31,038 --> 00:19:36,000
i mean you're the strongest one

506
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:40,240
[Laughter]

507
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,240
so tina's gonna jump in okay

508
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:46,079
because i've noticed like everybody

509
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:48,640

even though i do i miss all kinds of

521
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,840
stuff this is one of the few events

522
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:36,479
and i feel like i'm going with the

523
00:20:32,839 --> 00:20:38,879
commercial supermodels varietals

524
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,640
people actually have unique

525

528
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:01,720
my values too

529
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:11,679
it was very gratifying to open this and

530
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:14,158
see that yeah i was like hey come on

531
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:17,080
i had one last night and starting my day

532
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:20,130
again

533
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:20,129
[Music]

534
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,360
oh there was this

535
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:27,519
i mean there were several in here that i

536
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:29,119
was so excited about i'd like to see

537
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:30,558
which ones are yours and yours as well

538
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:33,038
because i didn't bring anything because

539
00:21:30,558 --> 00:21:35,519
i'd travel across the board oh yeah man

540
00:21:33,038 --> 00:21:36,960
i'm gonna come and check it out so why

541
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:38,879
don't you introduce these guys to what

542
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,480
you brought sure

543
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,720
this is um

544
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,640
bernie mac as label

545
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,600
and this is sapphire

546
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:49,919
so sapphire is a two to one

547
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:52,798
cbd to thc

548
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:53,919
um biovortex genetics

549
00:21:52,798 --> 00:21:55,918
and um

550
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:57,520
you know i was just i'm just really into

551
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:59,919
colas right now

552
00:21:57,519 --> 00:22:01,519
and just like so you can see

553
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:03,038
really kind of get a sense of the plant

554
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:04,158
right

555
00:22:03,038 --> 00:22:06,000
and really

556
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:08,640
trying to draw

557
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,480
the um like the bud and the flower back

558
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,520
to the plant

559
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,200
yes

560
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:14,960
yes

561
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,720
and so this grew we grew this in three

562
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,960
different environments and one of them

563
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:21,200
was in these deep google cultures one of

564
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,640
them was in a shallow google culture and

565
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,720
the other in boxes

566
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,159
and this is shallow google culture i can

567
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,880
tell by the structure because the

568
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:31,200
structures got like the the deep google

569
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,799
cultures ended up being kind of more

570
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,000
like big and fluffy

571
00:22:32,798 --> 00:22:34,798
and

572
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,880
and

573
00:22:34,798 --> 00:22:40,158
and big mamas you know

574
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:41,679
like really big expressive divas and

575
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:44,240
then the smaller

576
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:47,280
google culture medium-sized buds

577
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:48,319
medium-sized colas but a lot of some

578
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:53,720
girth

579
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:53,720
and then the boxes tighter smaller bugs

580
00:22:54,099 --> 00:22:57,240
[Music]

581
00:22:57,759 --> 00:23:01,919
there's lots of things to talk about but

582
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:03,279
would love impressions at you know any

583
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:05,440
point

584
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:07,119
and then this one

585
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:10,640
this is the bernie mac that's left which

586
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:11,918
is cool and i had done this oh let's see

587
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,360

588
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:14,720
crazy looking

589
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:16,319
buds

590
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,809
with sugar leaf

591
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:20,839
yeah that looks

592
00:23:17,809 --> 00:23:23,678
[Laughter]

593
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:25,599
delicious and i wanted to leave this

594
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:27,759
once again i wanted to leave like all

595
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:30,079
the leaf on all the sugar leaf

596
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:31,919
so you could just kind of check out

597
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:34,240
beautiful the um yeah i like to see it

598
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:35,759
we still get to see what it looks like

599
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,279
check out the show i mean that's all

600
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:38,960
good yeah it's just

601
00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:41,759
sugar

602
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:43,038
and if you can just feel the

603
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:45,038
remember last that we were talking about

604
00:23:43,038 --> 00:23:47,119
trichomes and trichome development

605
00:23:45,038 --> 00:23:50,240
and you can kind of feel like this is

606
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:50,239
definitely a greasy

607
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:54,079
yeah grease your trichomes

608
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:55,440
yes

609
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:57,599
you can break one off and just yeah and

610
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:59,919
it's got that nose that you get with the

611
00:23:57,599 --> 00:23:59,918
grease

612
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,960
what do you call that one this is bernie

613
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:07,600
mac and the genetics um

614
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:09,519
of this are by capulator and this was

615
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:12,240
something that we picked up to do some

616
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:14,558
pheno hunting and this was absolutely

617
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:17,519
the the weakest it was the week they

618
00:24:14,558 --> 00:24:19,918
were the weakest moms the weakest clones

619
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:22,798
when we transplanted them

620
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:24,720
they had transplant shock for two weeks

621
00:24:22,798 --> 00:24:26,558
they were slow to come back

622
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,000
and there were several times when i

623
00:24:26,558 --> 00:24:29,918
thought about pulling them out and

624
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,240
replacing them and then we just kept

625
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:35,200
going with them and going with them and

626
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:37,278
because we had this incredibly extended

627
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:41,440
like late summer

628
00:24:37,278 --> 00:24:43,359
they suddenly came on in september

629
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,558
and we finished cutting the first week

630
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:47,359
of december

631
00:24:44,558 --> 00:24:48,960
wow so they were it was like the rare

632
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:51,199
season for the late bloomer because we

633
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:53,519
just didn't have any weather yeah yeah

634
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:58,319
it was quite the season we started them

635
00:24:53,519 --> 00:25:00,779
with the clones we cut the clones in

636
00:24:58,319 --> 00:25:02,480
i want to say march

637
00:25:00,779 --> 00:25:04,000
[Music]

638
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,599
no maybe later

639
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,038
i think it was april that we cut the

640
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:08,879
clones but

641
00:25:07,038 --> 00:25:10,798
i was going to give up on them several

642
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,720
times and then she ended up being the

643
00:25:10,798 --> 00:25:14,639
superstar the clone superstar of the

644
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,880
year

645
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,080
so i'm glad i didn't give up

646
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,919
awesome

647
00:25:18,079 --> 00:25:23,439
and it had a really powerful had a

648
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:25,840
profound lesson about late bloomers

649
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,840
and you never know you never know

650
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:29,278
give them a

651
00:25:26,839 --> 00:25:30,959
chance i had a similar experience that

652
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:32,880
it's like i haven't grown this but this

653
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,640
is just the regular mac and i hunted a

654
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,720
couple years ago and

655
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:40,559
last season and

656
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:43,519
this season it like you know definitely

657
00:25:40,558 --> 00:25:45,440
struggled in in terms of speed of veg in

658
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:48,158
comparison to everyone else

659
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:50,159
but then when it started to flower

660
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:52,480
really worked out in our environment i

661
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:55,520
don't know at least where i'm at like it

662
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:58,480
just flowers really healthy and it just

663
00:25:55,519 --> 00:26:02,079
came out for me and come on

664
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:06,240
what's your elevation 1200

665
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:08,480
to 1900 depending on where and how far

666
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:11,359
are you from the coast

667
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:14,558
we're in bloxburgs so i don't know

668
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:16,719
exactly and in miles but like

669
00:26:14,558 --> 00:26:19,678
yeah something i think they were like 15

670
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:21,360
miles east of the 101 and the that would

671
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:22,720
be like probably about a miranda so i

672
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:24,558
don't know what that would be from there

673
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,480
out to the coast it's about 20 miles

674
00:26:24,558 --> 00:26:27,918
from the 101. less a little less of the

675
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,240
crow flies

676
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:32,080
no it's 20 miles yeah yeah so you might

677
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,359
be about 40 miles

678
00:26:32,079 --> 00:26:35,439
i guess

679
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:37,839
yeah how about you guys

680
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:41,600
um we live in the valley florikovalo

681
00:26:37,839 --> 00:26:41,599
which is around 1400 feet

682
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:47,200
but the mountains go around like 7 000

683
00:26:45,038 --> 00:26:48,720
above us so

684
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,080
we have our own little microclimate

685
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,360
there

686
00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:53,839
and then your climate's probably

687
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:56,158
completely different yeah yeah

688
00:26:53,839 --> 00:26:59,038
we have short seasons

689
00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:01,520
so what's your elevation how far from

690
00:26:59,038 --> 00:27:03,839
the the closest ocean right we're we're

691
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:06,158
eight hours inland like we're far from

692
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:06,158
ocean

693
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:24,480
not everybody where we live has good sun

694
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:25,519
like our places we get nice long days

695
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,759
and

696
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:31,278
i'm able to do uh

697
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:34,480
outdoor greek hoop houses

698
00:27:31,278 --> 00:27:36,159
i'd like them that way

699
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,519
it's like how do you decide you know you

700
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:39,120
work with the environment right to

701
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:41,038
figure out how you're going to

702
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:42,398
throw every strain though it's a lot

703
00:27:41,038 --> 00:27:43,919
like

704
00:27:42,398 --> 00:27:45,599
yeah it's pretty

705
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:47,679
pretty important to find the right

706
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:49,678
strains that'll work

707
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:52,000
in our climate

708
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:54,000
so which ones work for you

709
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,558
um there's some

710
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:59,880
some ones out there

711
00:27:56,558 --> 00:27:59,879
like um

712
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:13,600
there was one

713
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:18,640
my friend was working with

714
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:18,639
calling it white grizzly and that one

715
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:23,679
it just didn't have the

716
00:28:20,798 --> 00:28:25,759
thc levels but it was a really reliable

717
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:27,759
it's not gonna get mold and

718
00:28:25,759 --> 00:28:28,960
it's gonna finish

719
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:31,278
and then

720
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:34,240
people started breeding that one

721
00:28:31,278 --> 00:28:35,599
with this other one called seaweed

722
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:38,399
and

723
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:38,398
that's not what

724
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:44,600
much nicer look

725
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:44,600
another better finisher

726
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:55,940
[Music]

727
00:28:57,119 --> 00:29:03,439
i am rolling i think i'm rolling some of

728
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:05,439
this mac larry just put on the table

729
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:08,080
yeah i just pulled it out of that and

730
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:10,000
this is you this is you right yeah

731
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:11,659
yeah

732
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,720
and these are all sun roots

733
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:16,080
[Music]

734
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,079
yeah and we just uh

735
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:20,720
this color is incredible

736
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:26,960
we were talking about that earlier

737
00:29:24,398 --> 00:29:29,359
i think i did some of this last year uh

738
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:32,480
josh and kelly gave me some seeds

739
00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:34,959
and i was doing a light depth and

740
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,960
had all these crazy purples coming out

741
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:40,558
and i'm pretty sure

742
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:43,840
uh it was from you awesome velvet perps

743
00:29:40,558 --> 00:29:43,839
maybe yeah did you smell that

744
00:29:45,038 --> 00:29:48,000
yeah that's amazing

745
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:56,720
i'm curious about something when you see

746
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:57,599
trichomes falling off right

747
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:01,360
like

748
00:29:57,599 --> 00:30:02,959
is that abundance is that um temperature

749
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:06,319
is that humidity

750
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:08,960
probably a little heat humidity

751
00:30:06,319 --> 00:30:08,960
it was really

752
00:30:13,359 --> 00:30:16,959
i mean i think it's one fact everything

753
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:19,759
you i'm not disagreeing with anything

754
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:23,759
but um the longer the competition stock

755
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:26,240
the more likely it is to break off

756
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:28,480
i would be interested like to say

757
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:30,079
uh since there's all kinds of different

758
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:32,079
glands and some

759
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:34,879
for our purposes are more valuable than

760
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:37,599
others on the same bud like is it for

761
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:39,039
all the same like so are there equal

762
00:30:37,599 --> 00:30:42,398
percentages of those same different

763
00:30:39,038 --> 00:30:44,480
types of of trichomes left on the bud as

764
00:30:42,398 --> 00:30:46,398
on the

765
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:48,640
bag or glass or something interesting

766
00:30:46,398 --> 00:30:51,439
like which ones which glands are most

767
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:53,840
prone to drop

768
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:55,120
and is that those ones happening is that

769
00:30:53,839 --> 00:30:56,558
advantageous

770
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:58,719
like you're saying is it just because of

771
00:30:56,558 --> 00:31:01,599
an abundance like i see it probably more

772
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:05,360
in in india like whatever what's it

773
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:08,000
called indicates like you know dense the

774
00:31:05,359 --> 00:31:09,519
frosty buds most of what kind of sells

775
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,038
well for me and that's kind of like a

776
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:12,720
little discussion i've been having with

777
00:31:11,038 --> 00:31:14,398
a couple of people and we were kind of

778
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:16,079
talking about this with something like

779
00:31:14,398 --> 00:31:16,798
the lamb spread that just doesn't have

780
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:20,158
like

781
00:31:16,798 --> 00:31:23,359
visually like nearly as much crystal or

782
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:24,720
frost as most of my other varieties but

783
00:31:23,359 --> 00:31:27,678
it's way less likely to have stuff

784
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:30,159
shedding off on the bottom of the bag

785
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:33,679
it also doesn't get those high

786
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:36,240
numbers on tests but still has a an

787
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:38,559
effect that could be considered strong

788
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,319
so when we say strong and then we are

789
00:31:38,558 --> 00:31:42,079
also talking about numbers meaning

790
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:43,839
strength

791
00:31:42,079 --> 00:31:47,839
there's kind of an issue there so is

792
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:51,599
that leaf to calex ratio

793
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:53,678
right is that part of what's happening

794
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:55,519
yeah there's a there's a lot more leaf

795
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:57,440
in there than in like

796
00:31:55,519 --> 00:32:00,480
one some other variety

797
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:02,798
that's like

798
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:05,919
or like this yeah or like that would

799
00:32:02,798 --> 00:32:08,158
share way more parental lineage like way

800
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:09,840
more similar varieties than

801
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:12,399
that coming out of left field yeah that

802
00:32:09,839 --> 00:32:14,480
looks more like a land race yeah

803
00:32:12,398 --> 00:32:16,798
and all these have been poly hybrid

804
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:17,839
crosses with other poly hybrids like

805
00:32:16,798 --> 00:32:19,519
yeah

806
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:20,319
and this one

807
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:21,440
uh

808
00:32:20,319 --> 00:32:23,839
it's

809
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:27,640
that one and

810
00:32:23,839 --> 00:32:27,639
this one are

811
00:32:41,278 --> 00:32:45,839
yeah that's lovely

812
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:48,558
and that's more like what i

813
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:51,199
like i i personally like more like it's

814
00:32:48,558 --> 00:32:53,359
if is this a heritage genetic no

815
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:55,120
no it's a more nuclear but it's it's

816
00:32:53,359 --> 00:32:57,359
like more on that

817
00:32:55,119 --> 00:32:58,558
i don't know like enough about terpenes

818
00:32:57,359 --> 00:33:00,158
really speak but i guess like

819
00:32:58,558 --> 00:33:01,278
humiliating when people talk about earth

820
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:03,120
like deep

821
00:33:01,278 --> 00:33:04,640
earth cushy

822
00:33:03,119 --> 00:33:06,239
flavors and this is just a different

823
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,840
pheno of that and i think it has a

824
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,359
little bit more i guess what they call

825
00:33:07,839 --> 00:33:11,038
gas or whatever but

826
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:12,879
um

827
00:33:11,038 --> 00:33:14,879
whoa

828
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:17,440
i like got your pickles and your relish

829
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:19,519
on there too

830
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:22,240
this keeps an afghani

831
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:22,240
nose to it

832
00:33:22,839 --> 00:33:28,639
right and yeah like i i wouldn't consume

833
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,679
those all the time but i really like

834
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:33,519
having

835
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:35,919
something really strong in there and uh

836
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:39,519
i realized something kind of recently is

837
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:41,679
like a simple thing for me

838
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:43,759
in terms of describing like i don't care

839
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:45,840
what strain something is i think like

840
00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:47,839
most people here but

841
00:33:45,839 --> 00:33:50,798
one

842
00:33:47,839 --> 00:33:53,278
one distinction i do like to make is i

843
00:33:50,798 --> 00:33:54,720
like

844
00:33:53,278 --> 00:33:57,200
really more

845
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:58,159
upberty uppity type of weed for the most

846
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:01,440
part

847
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:05,360
but then when it's not that i like it to

848
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:06,960
be this strong antithesis to that and

849
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:08,559
the wii that personally doesn't speak to

850
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:11,358
you that much is all this stuff in the

851
00:34:08,559 --> 00:34:12,239
middle it's just kind of like murky

852
00:34:11,358 --> 00:34:15,039
and

853
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:16,799
that's subjective but for me

854
00:34:15,039 --> 00:34:18,000
and that's where i'm going back to this

855
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,599
kind of thing i've been talking and

856
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,519
thinking about a lot recently is my own

857
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:24,000
like personal hypocrisy

858
00:34:21,519 --> 00:34:26,480
around producing so much product that

859
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,599
would fall into that very category

860
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:30,240
uh

861
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:33,838
it's it's pretty and it's not that it

862
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:35,118
isn't potent clearly by its tests it's

863
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:36,078
something

864
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:37,679
but

865
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:39,679
it's

866
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:40,878
for my personal consumption it's falling

867
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:42,800
flat in

868
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:43,918
in some area because it's not really

869
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:47,280
pulling me

870
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:49,519
strongly in in either direction that's

871
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:52,000
like that that's just something it's

872
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:54,398
like a mediocre meal

873
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:57,679
it fills you up you're like

874
00:34:54,398 --> 00:34:59,199
i'm done i'm check box done with dinner

875
00:34:57,679 --> 00:35:00,879
yeah but that's about it

876
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:02,559
well is it also like different

877
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:05,358
personalities

878
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:08,799
yeah right and so it's interesting

879
00:35:05,358 --> 00:35:10,799
because this is like an adaptogen right

880
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:13,920
and it has so much to do with like

881
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:15,359
personally a two to one four to one

882
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:17,200
you know eight to one

883
00:35:15,358 --> 00:35:18,880
sits pretty well with me during the day

884
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:20,319
and at night like 90 this is nighty

885
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:22,000
night for me

886
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,100
you know i like i can't really smoke

887
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,199
this during the day

888
00:35:23,099 --> 00:35:27,759
[Music]

889
00:35:25,199 --> 00:35:30,078
or actually this is just thc

890
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:31,760
yeah this is just hc but nighty night a

891
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:33,280
little bit before like not right before

892
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:36,400
bed because it's clarity and it's kind

893
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:38,400
of like but it's pretty heavy thc and so

894
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:40,400
pretty probably intense it's pretty

895
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:42,880
intense or if i have like you know a lot

896
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:45,680
of communications to do it's def like

897
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:46,480
conversations will go way too long

898
00:35:45,679 --> 00:35:48,078
yeah

899
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,679
like if i'm just trying to stay to my

900
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:52,560
list and get down to brass tacks for the

901
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:52,559
day and get it done

902
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:57,280
if there's some creative time or time in

903
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:58,960
the garden go

904
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,800
and that's awesome right

905
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:02,639
but um it's also i've been thinking

906
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:04,400
about how much this is like this

907
00:36:02,639 --> 00:36:06,559
resembles art

908
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:08,320
like flower with the intention that goes

909
00:36:06,559 --> 00:36:09,679
into it and the personality and the

910
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,280
perspective

911
00:36:09,679 --> 00:36:13,440
and it's like the synthesis of life

912
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:15,359
experience you know there's nobody who

913
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:18,400
does it exactly the same

914
00:36:15,358 --> 00:36:20,880
you know and so is there a way to

915
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,760
so what's the criteria on

916
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,280
like

917
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:25,280
on taste

918
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:27,680
how do you account for taste or like

919
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,560
personal relationship with something you

920
00:36:27,679 --> 00:36:30,879
know

921
00:36:28,559 --> 00:36:36,239
it's like it's like to me it's more like

922
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:37,280
music or art or love than wine or beer

923
00:36:36,239 --> 00:36:40,479
or

924
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:42,880
food or any you know

925
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:44,800
i find like just growing the plant

926
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:47,680
throughout the year you build a

927
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:49,200
relationship with it like each each time

928
00:36:47,679 --> 00:36:51,358
you go out in the garden you're building

929
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:54,799
a relationship to it every time you

930
00:36:51,358 --> 00:36:56,719
clean it out you know and you know make

931
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:58,240
check it for bugs you're building that

932
00:36:56,719 --> 00:37:00,239
relationship so

933
00:36:58,239 --> 00:37:02,000
um

934
00:37:00,239 --> 00:37:03,439
yeah

935
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,559
i mean you remember plants from years

936
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:10,639
ago right oh yeah i remember every plant

937
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:10,639
in my garden for a long time

938
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:15,440
like that's a relationship yeah i can go

939
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:17,439
out in my garden and know what every

940
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,639
plant is like

941
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,559
or what like

942
00:37:18,639 --> 00:37:22,639
back in previous years

943
00:37:20,559 --> 00:37:24,880
i remember in that spot

944
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:26,960
and that was the one

945
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:29,760
and i think that's the one yeah what's

946
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:32,720
that spot going to do this year

947
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:34,240
and that's that's the beauty of like

948
00:37:32,719 --> 00:37:35,598
starting seeds and

949
00:37:34,239 --> 00:37:36,879
planting them with seeds because you

950
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:38,320
never know really what you're going to

951
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:40,240
get

952
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:42,480
so until you see the

953
00:37:40,239 --> 00:37:43,759
expression of it and

954
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:46,800
that's what really

955
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:50,520
makes it special to me

956
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,519
when do you see the expression

957
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:56,000
when like when is there a true

958
00:37:56,239 --> 00:37:59,519
i guess i guess that's kind of open

959
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:02,079
question but i

960
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:04,880
one thing that i'll say is like if i'm

961
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:07,280
working with things that are way out of

962
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:10,559
left field or something

963
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:12,480
then i see there's much earlier but it

964
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:14,799
gets tricky i think sometimes when i'm

965
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:17,280
working with 10 versions of the same

966
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:19,200
so i'm working on narrow gene pools and

967
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:22,400
we're trying to claim diversity and

968
00:38:19,199 --> 00:38:25,598
variety out of what's really not but

969
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:27,838
that's what the market is is screening

970
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:27,838
for

971
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:34,000
like play playing um

972
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:37,358
playing along with that and so it's like

973
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:39,039
when i get to come across these truly

974
00:38:37,358 --> 00:38:40,960
different flavors and i think there's

975
00:38:39,039 --> 00:38:42,639
like something not even like because

976
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,159
it's the biggest amount of different

977
00:38:42,639 --> 00:38:46,799
types of pot i looked at a gathering

978
00:38:44,159 --> 00:38:49,679
like this but it's a way bigger spread

979
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:51,200
because people are pulling things

980
00:38:49,679 --> 00:38:52,960
out of

981
00:38:51,199 --> 00:38:54,239
i don't know out of their own collection

982
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:56,079
of their parents collection their

983
00:38:54,239 --> 00:38:58,559
friends grandparents collection like

984
00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:00,720
that's when you brought 12 drawers 12

985
00:38:58,559 --> 00:39:02,719
different things and you you are pretty

986
00:39:00,719 --> 00:39:04,399
much like all these crosses here is

987
00:39:02,719 --> 00:39:06,879
there anything yeah that is center oh

988
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:08,559
except for this lemonhead i just

989
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:10,640
bought some seeds actually that last

990
00:39:08,559 --> 00:39:13,679
year for like the first time

991
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:15,598
because i wanted a super lemony variety

992
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:17,919
that i could cross back and i crossed it

993
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:19,680
into the velvet perp so next year

994
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:21,920
we'll have some

995
00:39:19,679 --> 00:39:24,319
it was just like some sea junkies or

996
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:25,838
something yeah

997
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:28,880
off the internet

998
00:39:25,838 --> 00:39:32,239
um but i wanted to

999
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:34,800
broaden the gene pool and make something

1000
00:39:32,239 --> 00:39:36,559
more unique you know like a purple

1001
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:38,079
super purple that has like a lemony

1002
00:39:36,559 --> 00:39:40,838
smell to it you know

1003
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:44,480
there's there's nothing like that yet

1004
00:39:40,838 --> 00:39:46,480
so we'll see how what how it goes

1005
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:47,599
what are you exciting

1006
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:49,199
um

1007
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:52,079
a bunch of

1008
00:39:49,199 --> 00:39:53,919
two to one crosses so like

1009
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:56,320
we have this one called lunar bouquet

1010
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:57,838
that's uh harley sue crossed with

1011
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:59,440
roseberry

1012
00:39:57,838 --> 00:40:04,159
and so

1013
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:06,400
it's got a nice like blueberry overtone

1014
00:40:04,159 --> 00:40:09,358
and it's also a bit earthy

1015
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:11,599
and i want to cross that back into

1016
00:40:09,358 --> 00:40:14,159
higher thc to

1017
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:16,318
really find a true one to one

1018
00:40:14,159 --> 00:40:18,078
is what i'm looking for

1019
00:40:16,318 --> 00:40:20,880
like searching for

1020
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:22,640
and um but the right one to one

1021
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:24,160
and um

1022
00:40:22,639 --> 00:40:25,838
and so there's some hunting to do around

1023
00:40:24,159 --> 00:40:28,480
that but that's the one that i'm most

1024
00:40:25,838 --> 00:40:28,480
excited about

1025
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:34,960
how about you

1026
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:37,680
well i'm just right in the transitioning

1027
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:40,480
between indoor and outdoors so

1028
00:40:37,679 --> 00:40:42,078
like i'm really

1029
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,880
trying to figure out what i'm gonna go

1030
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:44,720
with

1031
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:46,880
with this uh

1032
00:40:44,719 --> 00:40:51,799
you know the whole uh

1033
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:51,800
legalization and all that up in canada

1034
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:06,160
yeah that's part of uh

1035
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:07,760
this trip is like research even like uh

1036
00:41:06,159 --> 00:41:09,679
trying to figure out

1037
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:12,000
what to move forward with

1038
00:41:09,679 --> 00:41:14,000
my programs changing

1039
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,838
like those those ones i mentioned

1040
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,920
earlier like the jellyfish and the

1041
00:41:15,838 --> 00:41:20,880
seaweed

1042
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:20,880
the ones that i've been

1043
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:38,000
so you can destroy just anything yeah

1044
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:40,400
it's really interesting to see what's

1045
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,880
going to acclimate outside inside or

1046
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:44,160
inside outside well yeah yeah like the

1047
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,920
the light that's kind of like the

1048
00:41:44,159 --> 00:41:48,000
transition thing right so you see which

1049
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:51,358
ones are hardy and which ones are uh

1050
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:54,239
prone to mold they're milky

1051
00:41:51,358 --> 00:41:57,440
but yeah i'm uh

1052
00:41:54,239 --> 00:42:00,679
untapped you're hiring your feet

1053
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:00,679
pardon me

1054
00:42:04,059 --> 00:42:14,299
[Laughter]

1055
00:42:14,559 --> 00:42:17,838
yeah so i'm uh

1056
00:42:16,559 --> 00:42:20,318
just on the

1057
00:42:17,838 --> 00:42:23,119
that adventure of uh

1058
00:42:20,318 --> 00:42:24,800
you know the transition of legalization

1059
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:26,960
and

1060
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:31,680
discovery discovering you know what's

1061
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:33,760
going to work for for my uh

1062
00:42:31,679 --> 00:42:36,399
dream right to to

1063
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,400
to uh

1064
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:40,240
grow some fields of it

1065
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:41,679
have you tried the root or alice up

1066
00:42:40,239 --> 00:42:43,519
there well that's what i've been looking

1067
00:42:41,679 --> 00:42:45,759
into too because

1068
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:48,000
yeah i've i haven't not tried it but

1069
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:50,960
i've been talking to folks about it

1070
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,719
because i think that might be a real uh

1071
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:54,159
wait yeah

1072
00:42:52,719 --> 00:42:57,279
yeah

1073
00:42:54,159 --> 00:42:59,358
what's that dan dan yeah oh okay

1074
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:02,079
yeah i'll talk to him yeah yeah because

1075
00:42:59,358 --> 00:43:02,078
that's um

1076
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:07,280
i mean

1077
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:08,960
to fight the unpredictability of the

1078
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:10,630
fall right like that would be a good

1079
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:13,119
solution

1080
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:16,800
[Music]

1081
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:18,400
i mean i've been so stoked and see like

1082
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:19,599
i feel like this has happened in all

1083
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:21,599
kinds of

1084
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:24,000
i don't know things that i i caught like

1085
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:25,599
when they were new and

1086
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,519
i don't know because it didn't catch me

1087
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:29,760
at that time i didn't really go anywhere

1088
00:43:27,519 --> 00:43:30,559
with it meanwhile other people were

1089
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:33,119
and

1090
00:43:30,559 --> 00:43:34,559
so like when rudor alice or when

1091
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:37,039
you know people started pushing

1092
00:43:34,559 --> 00:43:38,559
autoflowers 10 or 15 years ago

1093
00:43:37,039 --> 00:43:40,719
maybe maybe longer but like it really

1094
00:43:38,559 --> 00:43:43,119
started to come on the forefront like

1095
00:43:40,719 --> 00:43:45,199
whatever mid late 2000s

1096
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:47,838
and they just weren't

1097
00:43:45,199 --> 00:43:48,719
there for the most part at least what we

1098
00:43:47,838 --> 00:43:52,400
saw

1099
00:43:48,719 --> 00:43:54,239
and uh and now i'm seeing some product

1100
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:56,000
that's pretty impressive well that's

1101
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:58,159
yeah i think there's some breeding with

1102
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,519
the root or alice right yeah yeah yeah

1103
00:43:58,159 --> 00:44:01,519
they're working but then the background

1104
00:43:59,519 --> 00:44:04,000
dance dance were looking good right fans

1105
00:44:01,519 --> 00:44:06,719
were looking good for rude or alice like

1106
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:08,960
yeah hell yeah yeah so cool and he was

1107
00:44:06,719 --> 00:44:10,959
like saying that if you you can breed

1108
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:13,039
you know he he

1109
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:14,400
three or four years down the line we're

1110
00:44:13,039 --> 00:44:16,719
going to have a reuter alice velvet

1111
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:22,000
perch so nice yeah

1112
00:44:16,719 --> 00:44:23,039
very cool yeah that's exciting very cool

1113
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,679
folks i

1114
00:44:23,039 --> 00:44:27,440
was talking to got uh two crops this

1115
00:44:25,679 --> 00:44:30,879
year with three doraleous yeah because

1116
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:32,000
they they planted their seeds

1117
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:34,480
like

1118
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,000
ten days two weeks before harvest

1119
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:38,159
right next to the ones they're about to

1120
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,679
harvest so then they had a protected

1121
00:44:38,159 --> 00:44:41,279
environment and

1122
00:44:39,679 --> 00:44:44,000
they said it worked out pretty good that

1123
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:45,839
is like right there that's true

1124
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,960
yeah so that's i know people doing a lot

1125
00:44:45,838 --> 00:44:50,599
more work

1126
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:50,599
that's a great idea

1127
00:44:57,889 --> 00:45:03,039
[Laughter]

1128
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:05,519
like so

1129
00:45:03,039 --> 00:45:08,318
like what's going on with the soil when

1130
00:45:05,519 --> 00:45:10,960
something like flowers are finishing

1131
00:45:08,318 --> 00:45:13,679
and then you're starting again i i agree

1132
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:16,800
i like i kind of like i'm kind of of

1133
00:45:13,679 --> 00:45:19,358
that persuasion but that again like

1134
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:21,039
but if this also works pretty well but

1135
00:45:19,358 --> 00:45:22,799
it's saving all these other ways there

1136
00:45:21,039 --> 00:45:25,358
just might be like such a place where

1137
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:26,880
that trade-off makes sense

1138
00:45:25,358 --> 00:45:28,880
like how do you how are you getting two

1139
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:29,920
crops a year like without light dipping

1140
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:31,440
like what are you talking about and

1141
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:32,400
that's what he told me he's doing i'm

1142
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,599
like

1143
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,680
whoa

1144
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:37,838
if the genetics are there waiting

1145
00:45:35,679 --> 00:45:41,199
waiting waiting waiting yeah

1146
00:45:37,838 --> 00:45:44,559
he said the first crop was uh 60 days

1147
00:45:41,199 --> 00:45:44,559
and the second one was 70.

1148
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:56,318
and he said it was

1149
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:57,680
he did the math it was 20

1150
00:45:56,318 --> 00:45:59,920
more

1151
00:45:57,679 --> 00:46:01,199
overall harvest than a single crop of

1152
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:02,318
bigfoots

1153
00:46:01,199 --> 00:46:04,318
yeah

1154
00:46:02,318 --> 00:46:06,000
really cool so i'm considering i'm

1155
00:46:04,318 --> 00:46:09,119
actually going to visit his farm when i

1156
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:12,000
get back and uh no trellising invited me

1157
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:13,280
for that yeah yeah yeah my big plan is i

1158
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,440
have to like

1159
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:16,880
cage them three times you know yeah so

1160
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:19,280
i'll have like a little inner one and a

1161
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:20,800
big outer one and then a net around that

1162
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:22,560
just to keep them from falling over

1163
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:24,880
that's how when i grew yours that's what

1164
00:46:22,559 --> 00:46:27,279
i was doing exactly yeah

1165
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:29,200
i was like i took some pictures of my

1166
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:32,000
top step of the step ladder doing some

1167
00:46:29,199 --> 00:46:33,439
pruning and tying up i'm like yeah

1168
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,559
one of the cool things about growing in

1169
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:36,480
terraces

1170
00:46:34,559 --> 00:46:39,039
there are spots where you can stand on a

1171
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:40,960
terrace above another terrace and like

1172
00:46:39,039 --> 00:46:43,440
utilize that it's like a scaffolding

1173
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:45,119
system yeah

1174
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:48,159
well i live on a flat

1175
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:50,240
valley so i can't do that you know that

1176
00:46:48,159 --> 00:46:52,399
must be terrible

1177
00:46:50,239 --> 00:46:54,959
there's so there's so much extra space

1178
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,960
to use

1179
00:46:55,039 --> 00:46:57,838
it would be really wonderful if you guys

1180
00:46:56,318 --> 00:46:59,199
could come by on your way out tomorrow

1181
00:46:57,838 --> 00:47:01,039
there's going to be i think a few people

1182
00:46:59,199 --> 00:47:02,399
that might trickle down some three

1183
00:47:01,039 --> 00:47:04,880
parcels away

1184
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:07,119
so like three parcels away from here

1185
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:10,240
down island mountain road towards town

1186
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:11,838
and to see like i mean it's it's

1187
00:47:10,239 --> 00:47:13,598
incredibly challenging like there are

1188
00:47:11,838 --> 00:47:14,799
these tiny little

1189
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:16,640
terraces

1190
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:19,680
with like steps

1191
00:47:16,639 --> 00:47:21,440
to all of our wider little roads um they

1192
00:47:19,679 --> 00:47:23,679
vary and it's all like none of it's

1193
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:26,559
consistent like this county and the

1194
00:47:23,679 --> 00:47:28,480
state hate us

1195
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:31,680
hate us i was gonna

1196
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:34,880
ask you about that

1197
00:47:31,679 --> 00:47:37,279
yeah some something for sure when the

1198
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:38,720
state came to my garden there and it's

1199
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:39,599
like what do you do

1200
00:47:38,719 --> 00:47:41,439
well

1201
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:44,000
and we've worked it all out and i made a

1202
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:46,000
lot of concessions and

1203
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:48,719
it went went through a lot of stuff but

1204
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:51,599
like when i've seen pictures of your

1205
00:47:48,719 --> 00:47:53,919
garden it's like i was gonna ask you how

1206
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:55,760
did that work with them well i spent a

1207
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:58,079
lot of time explaining why i shouldn't

1208
00:47:55,760 --> 00:48:00,240
be taxed for interplanting

1209
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:01,920
like for companion planting

1210
00:48:00,239 --> 00:48:03,519
and so the inspector was like well it's

1211
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:07,280
part of the cannabis i mean it's part of

1212
00:48:03,519 --> 00:48:08,800
your garden and i was like

1213
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:11,359
and i was like well just kind of

1214
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:14,400
consider the return on

1215
00:48:11,358 --> 00:48:16,558
um on this you know

1216
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:17,760
on these plants like on the on the

1217
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:19,440
companions

1218
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:21,359
like comfort i'm not going to sell this

1219
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:23,760
country and i'm not going to sell this

1220
00:48:21,358 --> 00:48:26,000
caster and i'm not going to sell this

1221
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:28,240
you know any of this amaranth

1222
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:30,639
and so why am i being taxed on the

1223
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:32,558
square footage for it

1224
00:48:30,639 --> 00:48:33,920
and so and then i started explaining

1225
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:35,839
like the reason why it's so important

1226
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:37,519
like for the for the soil health and for

1227
00:48:35,838 --> 00:48:40,318
the plant health and environmental

1228
00:48:37,519 --> 00:48:41,838
health and all of it and he by the end

1229
00:48:40,318 --> 00:48:44,480
of the inspection he was like okay it's

1230
00:48:41,838 --> 00:48:46,318
cool i get i think i get it

1231
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:48,960
and it was just a beautiful education

1232
00:48:46,318 --> 00:48:51,119
piece really awesome

1233
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:53,440
that's so great to hear

1234
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:56,400
um and who what what agency was this

1235
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:59,039
specifically well it was a

1236
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:00,240
a county inspector working for the state

1237
00:48:59,039 --> 00:49:02,000
because the state isn't sending

1238
00:49:00,239 --> 00:49:05,239
inspectors out there they're using

1239
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,239
county inspectors
