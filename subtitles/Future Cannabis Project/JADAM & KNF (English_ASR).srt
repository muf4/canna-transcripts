1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,429
I was really fascinated by the

2
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:17,879
conversation you just threw down about

3
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:20,820
five sentences on pest management this

4
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:22,799
morning yeah and you made reference to a

5
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,750
couple of different ferments and I

6
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,609
wonder if you would take the time to

7
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:29,879
review with me

8
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:32,730
those ferments which what specifically

9
00:00:29,879 --> 00:00:36,089
you were doing today as these ferments

10
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:37,738
and and maybe if you feel like you've

11
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:40,469
got the bandwidth in time to dig in a

12
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:42,750
little bit too what is the thinking in

13
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:47,280
your approach in using these

14
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:50,100
preparations for pest management yeah

15
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,469
so the first so they're not actually

16
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:55,350
firmance okay so that's the first the

17
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:57,629
first little caveat okay these are so

18
00:00:55,350 --> 00:01:00,170
Korean natural farming is all about

19
00:00:57,628 --> 00:01:03,390
fermentation and collecting indigenous

20
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:07,200
microorganisms from your forest floor so

21
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:09,210
Master Choa created this farming system

22
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,920
and it works really well but it is very

23
00:01:09,209 --> 00:01:13,140
much a system that you need all the

24
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:16,320
pieces for okay the one thing that he

25
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:19,109
and is also for human health as well all

26
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:21,239
the things in KNF are meant to keep your

27
00:01:19,109 --> 00:01:23,849
body healthy as well as your food crops

28
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:25,530
yes so that's why I love it and that's

29
00:01:23,849 --> 00:01:27,179
why I love putting it on my plants

30
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:29,790
because it's really nice to use

31
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:31,439
something in your crops and your farm

32
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:33,150
that you're using on your body as well

33
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:36,289
there's just a really beautiful synergy

34
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:38,850
to it I I just respond really well to

35
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:40,890
the only caveat to that is there are no

36
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:43,078
pesticides because you wouldn't put a

37
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:45,509
pesticide in your body so it kind of

38
00:01:43,078 --> 00:01:48,419
goes against traditional Korean natural

39
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:50,519
farming so master to his son came along

40
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:54,840
and he took his dad's work and he said

41
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:58,069
this is awesome but for some areas there

42
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:59,790
needs to be more so he started taking

43
00:01:58,069 --> 00:02:01,649
industrial and I

44
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:04,910
I could be a little bit off on this

45
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:11,250
because the Jaedong book that in Spanish

46
00:02:04,909 --> 00:02:13,829
his master chose book is one of his

47
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:17,520
books the one straw revolution no no

48
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:19,770
that's a different okay he's amazing -

49
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:26,610
yeah but he's more of like a do-nothing

50
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:29,850
farming yeah different okay so master

51
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:32,280
chosun created an another type of very

52
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:34,229
low-cost agricultural farming but more

53
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:40,909
of a scaled up version and it includes

54
00:02:34,229 --> 00:02:43,889
pesticides and it's Jaedong jad a.m. yep

55
00:02:40,909 --> 00:02:47,909
so KN f stands for Korean natural

56
00:02:43,889 --> 00:02:52,739
farming I believe G Dom has something

57
00:02:47,909 --> 00:02:55,109
that it's yeah it's called what is it

58
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:56,430
extreme low-cost agriculture something

59
00:02:55,110 --> 00:03:00,450
along those lines so it could be that in

60
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:01,370
Korean I don't really know and so in the

61
00:03:00,449 --> 00:03:04,409
genome

62
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:06,270
I don't really use he does a lot of like

63
00:03:04,409 --> 00:03:08,699
it's called JL after Dom liquid

64
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:10,409
fertilizer where you pick whatever weeds

65
00:03:08,699 --> 00:03:12,060
you want you toss them in a bucket you

66
00:03:10,409 --> 00:03:19,709
fill it with water and you let it sit

67
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:20,909
there and stagnate and you know pretty

68
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:33,629
much a few farm you've done it on

69
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:36,419
accident yeah so again I don't really do

70
00:03:33,629 --> 00:03:38,939
that but the pesticide application that

71
00:03:36,419 --> 00:03:42,199
he does is amazing okay so the first

72
00:03:38,939 --> 00:03:45,750
part is a wetting agent okay JWA

73
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:48,359
jeong-ja Dom wetting agent and it's

74
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:49,500
basically a castile soap okay so what

75
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,760
you're doing is you're really making

76
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:54,959
your own soap you're using potassium

77
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:59,810
hydroxide you use water and you use

78
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:03,300
canola oil and it gets extremely hot

79
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:05,009
yeah when you go through the book

80
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:08,430
gives you the ratios I don't have them

81
00:04:05,009 --> 00:04:10,139
off the top of my head but well I can

82
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:12,780
email them to you yeah it's almost like

83
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:15,269
you're making biodiesel little flavor of

84
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:17,129
that going on certification maybe okay

85
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:18,090
so you basically you have a little bit

86
00:04:17,129 --> 00:04:20,699
of water you add your potassium

87
00:04:18,089 --> 00:04:22,560
hydroxide it gets hot yeah and then you

88
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:25,589
start slowly pouring in your canola oil

89
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,629
and then you use a paddle mixer so the

90
00:04:25,589 --> 00:04:30,689
thing with making soap normally is that

91
00:04:27,629 --> 00:04:34,980
you're using a live process right to

92
00:04:30,689 --> 00:04:37,050
create the heat yes and what this

93
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:38,970
gentleman did was he said I want to be

94
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:41,009
able to make a wetting agent but I want

95
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:43,080
to make it economical and I want to make

96
00:04:41,009 --> 00:04:44,849
it that some they can do themselves and

97
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:46,919
using lye is very dangerous

98
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:49,710
so like what can we do and how do we do

99
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:51,540
this and he he he did like over a

100
00:04:49,709 --> 00:04:53,549
hundred experiments to get the ratios

101
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:55,020
right yes he's like it's all about the

102
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:57,449
paddle mixer okay

103
00:04:55,019 --> 00:04:59,729
cordless drill was like a paint paint

104
00:04:57,449 --> 00:05:01,680
stirrer yeah and you get down into it

105
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:03,030
and you start stirring it and it starts

106
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,100
getting hotter and hotter and hotter and

107
00:05:03,029 --> 00:05:06,809
it gets up to like a hundred and eighty

108
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:09,770
degrees or something like it's like

109
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:13,139
you're sweating it's like kind of brutal

110
00:05:09,769 --> 00:05:14,279
and then you take your paddle mixer out

111
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:17,759
when it gets to a certain consistency

112
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:21,000
like thick mayonnaise and this is the

113
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:23,459
wetting agent okay this is beautiful

114
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,290
thank you so then you take your out and

115
00:05:23,459 --> 00:05:27,299
you let it set for about three days and

116
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:28,919
over the course of the three days the

117
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:32,009
heat starts to dissipate and it gets

118
00:05:28,918 --> 00:05:34,949
thick and it turns into like a block of

119
00:05:32,009 --> 00:05:39,329
soap basically floating on top of some

120
00:05:34,949 --> 00:05:42,649
water and glycerin and it is it's not

121
00:05:39,329 --> 00:05:46,949
solid solid but it's good you know yeah

122
00:05:42,649 --> 00:05:48,539
it's like okay so then you add the rest

123
00:05:46,949 --> 00:05:51,029
of your water to turn it into a liquid

124
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:52,860
soap right and you just basically add

125
00:05:51,029 --> 00:05:54,689
your water and you stir it and you stir

126
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:56,460
it and you let it sit for a while and

127
00:05:54,689 --> 00:05:58,680
eventually it all dissolves and you have

128
00:05:56,459 --> 00:06:01,409
this amazing beautiful liquid soap that

129
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:03,120
you can use as a soap and you also use

130
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:05,460
it as a wetting agent for the plants so

131
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,500
that you can have your your water

132
00:06:05,459 --> 00:06:08,549
tension is broken right so your

133
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:12,199
pesticides will stay

134
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:16,050
on your leaf surface better okay yeah so

135
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:17,970
we figured out that this thing I made a

136
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:20,220
I took a pickle barrel and I made about

137
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:25,259
48 gallons of liquid so I was going to

138
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:30,240
ask it's worth doing it's worth doing

139
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:34,199
that scale and the cost was less than $1

140
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:36,900
per gallon so it was just like this is I

141
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:38,848
mean phenomenally economical so this is

142
00:06:36,899 --> 00:06:45,779
a so point could use for laundry for

143
00:06:38,848 --> 00:06:47,490
example or washing one's body my hand

144
00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:50,250
soap I put different essential oils in

145
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:52,199
it for that and then we have it as just

146
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:54,029
it's most of it still in the pickle

147
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:56,669
barrel but then I have a bunch of gallon

148
00:06:54,029 --> 00:07:00,658
we used gallon jugs that I can siphon it

149
00:06:56,668 --> 00:07:02,968
into and I love the specificity of

150
00:07:00,658 --> 00:07:04,949
actually making your own wedding agent

151
00:07:02,968 --> 00:07:07,110
it's cool so I have a specific question

152
00:07:04,949 --> 00:07:09,360
about the wedding agent is it have I

153
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:12,000
know that some wedding agents for

154
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,770
example in mild dilution in water can be

155
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,718
effective against small bodied insects

156
00:07:13,769 --> 00:07:19,978
with no additional input right so

157
00:07:17,718 --> 00:07:22,968
there's a level of you're using it in

158
00:07:19,978 --> 00:07:25,258
that context as well as perhaps other

159
00:07:22,968 --> 00:07:28,829
materials that you might mix into a

160
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:31,800
water solution to make a spray good stop

161
00:07:28,829 --> 00:07:34,258
please well and so it's exactly what you

162
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,669
said so one of the guys that I've been

163
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:37,710
working with it you know we're trying

164
00:07:35,668 --> 00:07:39,538
different things in different farms in

165
00:07:37,709 --> 00:07:40,978
different areas and coming back together

166
00:07:39,538 --> 00:07:45,629
with our data to see what's working

167
00:07:40,978 --> 00:07:47,629
what's not and he used just the JWA so

168
00:07:45,629 --> 00:07:53,490
just the wetting agent with sea water

169
00:07:47,629 --> 00:07:54,629
strength with ocean water ocean water so

170
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:56,250
the ocean water is all your

171
00:07:54,629 --> 00:07:59,278
micronutrients all your minerals

172
00:07:56,250 --> 00:08:01,949
everything generally that's used at a 1

173
00:07:59,278 --> 00:08:05,759
to 30 die Lucian but he was just going

174
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:07,169
full-on ocean water and I'd have to look

175
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:10,560
at my notes and see what he did for the

176
00:08:07,168 --> 00:08:13,019
ratios of the JWA but he found that that

177
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,399
alone as a preventative was effective

178
00:08:13,019 --> 00:08:17,359
enough that he didn't need to add

179
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:20,158
anything else huh so this is

180
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,400
prophylactic use basically before before

181
00:08:20,158 --> 00:08:25,209
insects becoming as

182
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:31,089
right for the pest is a problem your and

183
00:08:25,209 --> 00:08:34,210
it occurs to me that in addition to some

184
00:08:31,089 --> 00:08:36,370
activity that is likely again hard on a

185
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:39,849
soft bodied insects there's something

186
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:43,330
going on with stimulating the plant's

187
00:08:39,849 --> 00:08:46,180
ability to deal with pests potentially

188
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:48,460
and/or making the plant less attractive

189
00:08:46,179 --> 00:08:50,979
to pests is that a fair statement as

190
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:55,028
well would you say I would imagine so I

191
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:56,500
don't actually know for sure I mean I

192
00:08:55,028 --> 00:09:00,399
can imagine that yeah if you're making

193
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:02,230
the surface of the leaf you know less

194
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,059
attractive because yeah there's soap on

195
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:06,850
it like there's it's gonna be a more

196
00:09:04,059 --> 00:09:08,799
difficult situation for them well one of

197
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:11,230
the things I was going towards in my

198
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:14,229
question there is it's my understanding

199
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:16,589
that plants that are stressed due to

200
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:20,230
over watering for example put off a

201
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:24,190
signature in a light frequency that

202
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:26,050
maybe we can't see but thrips see really

203
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:28,660
well when they're in their life stage of

204
00:09:26,049 --> 00:09:30,789
flying about they see this below there's

205
00:09:28,659 --> 00:09:31,539
that's gravy train right there let's go

206
00:09:30,789 --> 00:09:34,539
do that

207
00:09:31,539 --> 00:09:36,519
and so part of part of the approach that

208
00:09:34,539 --> 00:09:37,689
I've taken in pest management and part

209
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:41,528
of why I'm interested in this

210
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:43,240
conversation with you is it seems really

211
00:09:41,528 --> 00:09:46,750
clear to me that a lot what we're doing

212
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:49,899
is is enhancing the plant's ability to

213
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:52,299
deal with these creatures and then our

214
00:09:49,899 --> 00:09:55,629
allies in the garden other plant bugs

215
00:09:52,299 --> 00:09:59,500
that might let these bugs for food there

216
00:09:55,629 --> 00:10:01,570
they are there to help us but it's so

217
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,950
anytime that you are taking an approach

218
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:06,010
up I'm just going to kill everything

219
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:14,230
right you've really set yourself back a

220
00:10:06,009 --> 00:10:16,689
long ways 100% correct so when a plant

221
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:19,870
is stressed or sick it sends out a

222
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:21,339
signal to bugs and they'll continue to

223
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:23,470
put out the pheromones though this is

224
00:10:21,339 --> 00:10:25,600
the one we're eating and what we think

225
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:27,850
this happening is that it has to do with

226
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,339
the fact that sick plants have a hard

227
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:31,810
time building their cellulose layers

228
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:33,010
thinner right so if it's thinner it's

229
00:10:31,809 --> 00:10:34,189
actually putting on a different

230
00:10:33,009 --> 00:10:36,588
signature of

231
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:39,529
of wavelengths of color and light that

232
00:10:36,589 --> 00:10:42,649
we don't necessarily notice but the bugs

233
00:10:39,528 --> 00:10:44,568
are very drawn to yes so it's it's I

234
00:10:42,649 --> 00:10:48,379
mean it's really fascinating stuff when

235
00:10:44,568 --> 00:10:51,188
you get into it so for the basics what I

236
00:10:48,379 --> 00:10:53,480
was talking about earlier too was that

237
00:10:51,188 --> 00:10:55,879
ideally you have a plant that is strong

238
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:58,069
enough that it fends it off yes any of

239
00:10:55,879 --> 00:11:00,170
this extra stuff of course so again that

240
00:10:58,068 --> 00:11:02,628
comes down into soil health yes and that

241
00:11:00,169 --> 00:11:04,818
comes into the base of Korean natural

242
00:11:02,629 --> 00:11:07,550
farming so there's this whole 8020

243
00:11:04,818 --> 00:11:11,688
principle and everything that we do what

244
00:11:07,549 --> 00:11:15,639
you put into one thing can be eighty

245
00:11:11,688 --> 00:11:18,289
percent of the difference of what that

246
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:20,750
what am I trying to say you know there's

247
00:11:18,289 --> 00:11:22,458
there's so if you take like Korean

248
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:24,948
natural farming okay and take it as a

249
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:27,768
system so 100 percent okay there's one

250
00:11:24,948 --> 00:11:32,778
part of it that is gonna be 80 percent

251
00:11:27,769 --> 00:11:36,560
of the the aspect that you see so one

252
00:11:32,778 --> 00:11:40,429
part of your entire system because 80

253
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:42,888
percent of the effect so in the case of

254
00:11:40,429 --> 00:11:45,198
Korean natural farming if you do one

255
00:11:42,889 --> 00:11:50,600
thing in Korean natural farming and only

256
00:11:45,198 --> 00:11:52,399
one thing if you only do like a know H n

257
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:55,579
which is like my second favorite input

258
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:58,698
so oriental herbal nutrient fabulous for

259
00:11:55,578 --> 00:12:01,250
human health it's amazing OAH and

260
00:11:58,698 --> 00:12:03,379
oriental herbal nutrient okay it's

261
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:06,549
basically a tincture that's comprised of

262
00:12:03,379 --> 00:12:09,370
Angelica garlic ginger

263
00:12:06,549 --> 00:12:13,778
sorry I'll talk a little slower

264
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:20,688
nutrients yeah so Angelica garlic ginger

265
00:12:13,778 --> 00:12:22,669
cinnamon and licorice and it takes three

266
00:12:20,688 --> 00:12:24,740
months to make you do a fermentation of

267
00:12:22,669 --> 00:12:26,750
that one first so that's the one you do

268
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:28,339
you ferment for a week first and then

269
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:32,980
you start tinkering it with vodka and

270
00:12:28,339 --> 00:12:36,769
you end up with this warm amazing

271
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:38,420
liqueur that is just like I take about a

272
00:12:36,769 --> 00:12:40,850
half an ounce a day if I'm getting sick

273
00:12:38,419 --> 00:12:42,198
otherwise I just take a little sip off

274
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:44,959
of it every now and then but it's also

275
00:12:42,198 --> 00:12:47,359
your kind of your your immune booster

276
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:50,659
for your plants as well I

277
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:53,029
so I love that and it's a great product

278
00:12:50,659 --> 00:12:56,000
but that as well as all the other

279
00:12:53,029 --> 00:12:57,949
ferments and all the other extracts and

280
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,340
all the other components that you do

281
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:04,640
that only makes up about 20% of what's

282
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:06,980
effective in KNF okay 80% of the

283
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,720
efficacy of this system is the

284
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:12,409
indigenous microorganisms that you're

285
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:14,720
collecting and adding to your soil and

286
00:13:12,409 --> 00:13:17,240
so this is it's the thing everybody does

287
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:20,180
last yeah it's one of the hardest ones

288
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:23,240
to nail correctly but once you get it

289
00:13:20,179 --> 00:13:25,370
it's just like I mean I had a lemon

290
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:28,430
cucumber that I pulled over 200

291
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:30,289
cucumbers off of this year I'm their

292
00:13:28,429 --> 00:13:32,959
prolific plants I mean but this was

293
00:13:30,289 --> 00:13:34,490
ridiculous I I was just like this is

294
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:36,710
absolutely nuts

295
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:38,659
mmm after two years of treating my soil

296
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:42,230
with IMO mm-hmm

297
00:13:38,659 --> 00:13:43,759
it was I mean the tomatoes were it it

298
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:45,950
was it was insane how much food went to

299
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:51,009
waste on my garden cuz I couldn't get to

300
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:53,390
it well so indigenous microorganisms I

301
00:13:51,009 --> 00:13:55,220
call those inoculations

302
00:13:53,389 --> 00:13:57,769
I'm not reform' ly trained in all this

303
00:13:55,220 --> 00:14:02,750
but I a lot of it just made sense to me

304
00:13:57,769 --> 00:14:05,799
and what I do is cook some white rice

305
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:08,149
put it in a wooden box I and

306
00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:09,859
specifically as it applies to cannabis

307
00:14:08,149 --> 00:14:11,449
for example if I have a whole row of

308
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:13,100
cuttings if I'm doing a production

309
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:15,080
garden for example and I've got a whole

310
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:17,300
row cuttings they're all the same plant

311
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:19,100
and you look at them typically they're

312
00:14:17,299 --> 00:14:22,069
not all the same even though there are

313
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:24,769
the same some of them clearly usually

314
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:28,400
are doing better than others and what I

315
00:14:24,769 --> 00:14:30,639
usually do is I would go to one of the

316
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:33,350
ones that's really flourishing and

317
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:35,870
basically take an inoculation a

318
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:37,700
cultivation of what's going on in the

319
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:41,389
biology of the soil right underneath

320
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:42,950
that specific plant and then spread that

321
00:14:41,389 --> 00:14:44,929
to the other cuttings and I do see

322
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:46,190
benefit from that then is that basically

323
00:14:44,929 --> 00:14:48,439
what you're talking about is a version

324
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:50,360
of that a version of that a version of

325
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:53,420
it okay so

326
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:57,139
so the idea of and we've totally gotten

327
00:14:53,419 --> 00:14:59,719
off subject of pesticides but well this

328
00:14:57,139 --> 00:15:01,189
that the health of the plants the health

329
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:08,120
of the plants and the soil really

330
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:09,770
contributes to that pest management you

331
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:11,720
can use it as a preventative now and

332
00:15:09,769 --> 00:15:13,759
then we think about it but if you don't

333
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:17,300
have infestations it's easier to just

334
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:19,429
avoid that so when you're going out into

335
00:15:17,299 --> 00:15:21,559
the forest and you start like lifting up

336
00:15:19,429 --> 00:15:24,169
the litter and looking you'll eventually

337
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:26,809
start finding areas that are really rich

338
00:15:24,169 --> 00:15:30,139
in mycelium so you'll see all that white

339
00:15:26,809 --> 00:15:31,639
beautiful running you know mycelium and

340
00:15:30,139 --> 00:15:33,470
that's where you want to set your that

341
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:36,139
same box exactly what you're doing there

342
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:37,820
but put it there instead yes and after

343
00:15:36,139 --> 00:15:39,409
anywhere from and this is where it

344
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:41,390
starts getting a little like touchy

345
00:15:39,409 --> 00:15:44,559
after anywhere from like five days to

346
00:15:41,389 --> 00:15:48,019
thirteen days depending on your weather

347
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:50,239
all of that it'll culture that whole box

348
00:15:48,019 --> 00:15:52,850
and you get all these beautiful colors

349
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,470
of different things going on a lot of

350
00:15:52,850 --> 00:16:01,610
the white fluffy is what you're really

351
00:15:54,470 --> 00:16:03,440
wanting but we always have a little bit

352
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:04,940
of this and that so then you take that

353
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,490
and what you want to do is you want to

354
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:09,140
create a shelf stable product okay so

355
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:10,339
you're gonna add it one to one with

356
00:16:09,139 --> 00:16:12,949
brown with sugar

357
00:16:10,339 --> 00:16:15,920
ideally Demerara or a raw sugar but

358
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:17,930
brown sugar works fine too yes versus

359
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:20,120
molasses that's Sun sulfur for example

360
00:16:17,929 --> 00:16:21,349
molasses is not good okay and the reason

361
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:23,750
why is we're not looking for a sugar

362
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:25,639
content on this we're looking for that

363
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:29,179
what the sugar does is it actually draws

364
00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:31,100
all the water out of the microbes and

365
00:16:29,179 --> 00:16:33,919
what you've done is through the osmotic

366
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:35,620
pressure of the sugar removing the water

367
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:38,078
the microbes then are basically

368
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:39,440
dehydrated and they go dormant and

369
00:16:38,078 --> 00:16:40,989
shelf-stable

370
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,579
and now they're shelf stable for years

371
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:45,110
listen now you have all of those

372
00:16:43,578 --> 00:16:47,870
indigenous microorganisms they were

373
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:49,789
thriving in that area in that condition

374
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:52,850
with that temperature and that humidity

375
00:16:49,789 --> 00:16:55,039
and that time of year and you have now

376
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:58,100
encapsulated them on your shelf to be

377
00:16:55,039 --> 00:17:00,278
utilized when you need to later and the

378
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:02,750
sugar you're going about equal amounts

379
00:17:00,278 --> 00:17:06,980
one to one volume-wise

380
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:08,750
wait bye wait okay okay and then what

381
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:10,338
you what you're really going after is

382
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:13,519
doing this from a couple different

383
00:17:10,338 --> 00:17:16,668
spaces yes on the line on the landing

384
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:20,568
yes on your land every season I leave

385
00:17:16,669 --> 00:17:23,209
500 feet elevation above where you're

386
00:17:20,568 --> 00:17:26,629
growing oh really I have to go to

387
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:28,759
somebody else's land that one off I mean

388
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:30,830
what I love about this approach that

389
00:17:28,759 --> 00:17:34,788
what you just described is you are

390
00:17:30,829 --> 00:17:37,639
capturing the biology that is working on

391
00:17:34,788 --> 00:17:40,788
your land that is flourishing on your

392
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:43,759
soil in the in the soil you have and so

393
00:17:40,788 --> 00:17:46,220
it seems to me you're you're basically

394
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:48,379
helping nature to bridge into your

395
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:50,630
garden or any place you're using this

396
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:52,789
preparation because a lot of times our

397
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:54,620
garden soils are very heavy on the

398
00:17:52,788 --> 00:17:56,779
bacteria they're usually in fields

399
00:17:54,619 --> 00:17:58,908
they've been you know disturbed they've

400
00:17:56,779 --> 00:18:01,038
got you know primary growth but not a

401
00:17:58,909 --> 00:18:04,159
lot of like secondary or tertiary gross

402
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:05,900
we don't do it in the forest yes and so

403
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:07,970
you're taking that fungal a dominant

404
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:14,509
forest litter which we know is so rich

405
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:16,579
in humic acid and the biology is living

406
00:18:14,509 --> 00:18:19,158
in there at that time so then if you

407
00:18:16,579 --> 00:18:21,259
have you know a bunch of different IMO

408
00:18:19,159 --> 00:18:23,630
two collections so IMO one is when it's

409
00:18:21,259 --> 00:18:25,308
with the rice mm-hmm IMO two is when you

410
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:27,140
add it to the brown sugar mm-hmm and

411
00:18:25,308 --> 00:18:29,329
then you make something called IMO three

412
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:30,890
so you'd do 1/3 and then you can go four

413
00:18:29,329 --> 00:18:33,558
and then you can go five as well and

414
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:35,990
number three you're taking a bunch of

415
00:18:33,558 --> 00:18:37,158
your different twos so I would take

416
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:38,960
something from my spring collection

417
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:40,429
something from my summer collection

418
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,440
something from fall

419
00:18:40,429 --> 00:18:44,120
I've yet to pull off a winter one but

420
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:47,210
someday I will and I'll have that in

421
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:49,279
there too or you know if you have you

422
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:50,720
know as your collection builds you can

423
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:53,658
start using more and more and more of

424
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:56,509
them mm-hmm and now your inoculating a

425
00:18:53,659 --> 00:18:58,340
carbon and carbohydrate source so you're

426
00:18:56,509 --> 00:19:02,480
using wood chips and a grain usually

427
00:18:58,339 --> 00:19:04,369
yeah and you're making a bigger pile and

428
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,929
you're keeping it low in heat so you're

429
00:19:04,369 --> 00:19:08,178
not composting it you want to keep it

430
00:19:05,929 --> 00:19:11,470
below 130 degrees because you're

431
00:19:08,179 --> 00:19:13,880
flipping it a lot you're turning it and

432
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:15,990
you'll see that that fungal high that

433
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:18,240
fungal mycelium starts into

434
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:21,120
webbing all of that and so now you have

435
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:23,130
what's called IMO 2:3 pardon me which

436
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:26,939
also can be stored longer-term once it's

437
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:30,030
finished but it's now encapsulating all

438
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:32,160
of those different fungal collections

439
00:19:30,029 --> 00:19:33,808
that you did so it's not just one kind

440
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,269
that's dominant you've got a huge

441
00:19:33,808 --> 00:19:38,190
diversity and if you take that to your

442
00:19:36,269 --> 00:19:40,410
garden and you spread that out and you

443
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:42,000
can your IMO four is the same thing but

444
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:45,690
then you're adding soil from your garden

445
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,759
so now it's the biology is really ready

446
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:51,090
for exactly the soil that it's gonna go

447
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:52,589
into and then you can do IMO five which

448
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:54,689
is adding a nitrogen source so you can

449
00:19:52,589 --> 00:19:58,019
add that to a manure or something and

450
00:19:54,690 --> 00:20:00,509
you can make it go much further but what

451
00:19:58,019 --> 00:20:03,329
the idea here right is you've added all

452
00:20:00,509 --> 00:20:05,308
this diversity to the garden soils which

453
00:20:03,329 --> 00:20:07,740
means that no matter what's going on in

454
00:20:05,308 --> 00:20:10,859
the weather and the ground you have some

455
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:17,009
type of fungal microbe that is super

456
00:20:10,859 --> 00:20:20,609
duper happy it's always gonna be fungal

457
00:20:17,009 --> 00:20:22,200
e dominant which means that all of the

458
00:20:20,609 --> 00:20:23,159
crops that we grow except for the

459
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,860
brassicas

460
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:30,179
prefer a fungally dominant so your weeds

461
00:20:25,859 --> 00:20:33,000
die back you have I mean I've had crazy

462
00:20:30,179 --> 00:20:35,519
like bindweed that gets covered in

463
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,170
powdery mildew climbing up like a

464
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:39,599
cucumber which should have powdery

465
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:41,700
mildew and doesn't that's just gorgeous

466
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:43,319
like no problems I've had grasses that

467
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:45,420
are really really difficult to deal with

468
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:47,609
usually that will sprout and then just

469
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:50,220
like fall over and I'm like oh my god

470
00:20:47,609 --> 00:20:53,428
this is really cool I mean people talk

471
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:55,620
about that's it so that implies that

472
00:20:53,429 --> 00:20:57,059
some plants don't like that environment

473
00:20:55,619 --> 00:20:58,739
and they happen to be a lot of the ones

474
00:20:57,058 --> 00:21:02,099
you don't want right

475
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:04,500
so weeds so and it really has again

476
00:21:02,099 --> 00:21:07,289
coming back to nature when you see a

477
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:10,079
disturbed area the first things to go

478
00:21:07,289 --> 00:21:14,069
there and be really happy in that area

479
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:16,609
are your grasses so those are plants

480
00:21:14,069 --> 00:21:19,289
that prefer bacteria dominant soil

481
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:22,079
most of the food crops that we eat and

482
00:21:19,289 --> 00:21:24,750
our cannabis and our trees and all of

483
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:27,569
this prefer a fungally dominant soil so

484
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:28,769
they're they don't you know the two of

485
00:21:27,569 --> 00:21:29,609
them together once you start getting

486
00:21:28,769 --> 00:21:31,470
your fungal DOM

487
00:21:29,609 --> 00:21:34,439
it's up your weed's just they just don't

488
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:39,630
do well they don't communicate as well

489
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:41,730
with the fungi like in a forest so yeah

490
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:43,890
so you have less weeds you've got less

491
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:45,630
problems with that again brassicas are

492
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:47,280
different I actually have an area now

493
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:52,080
that's like my Brassica area that I

494
00:21:47,279 --> 00:22:03,269
don't treat with you use manures there

495
00:21:52,079 --> 00:22:04,649
I don't actually pulled off some really

496
00:22:03,269 --> 00:22:08,609
good cauliflower for the first time ever

497
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:10,530
so that was exciting but yes so you have

498
00:22:08,609 --> 00:22:12,359
your indigenous microorganisms you've

499
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:15,750
got already a stronger healthier plant

500
00:22:12,359 --> 00:22:17,308
now all of that being said when you talk

501
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:18,599
with like Chris Trump he's just like

502
00:22:17,308 --> 00:22:20,700
well that's all you really need you

503
00:22:18,599 --> 00:22:22,409
don't need the you know the pesticides

504
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:24,750
because you don't have those problems

505
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:27,450
mm-hmm the thing with cannabis that

506
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:29,460
often other farmers don't understand and

507
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:32,400
why we see all these hemp fields

508
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:34,470
you know declining and and not doing

509
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,809
well is because they're thinking of it

510
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:37,919
like a normal plant where you know okay

511
00:22:36,808 --> 00:22:39,298
if I have corn

512
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:40,770
I've got corn earworm and that's

513
00:22:39,298 --> 00:22:42,509
basically all I really have to think

514
00:22:40,769 --> 00:22:44,519
about and deal with I've got cabbage

515
00:22:42,509 --> 00:22:48,058
it's a cabbage looper maybe some aphids

516
00:22:44,519 --> 00:22:50,460
right but you know everything loves

517
00:22:48,058 --> 00:22:52,678
cannabis yeah like every bug in the

518
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:54,539
world loves cannabis if it eats a plant

519
00:22:52,679 --> 00:22:55,500
it's gonna eat weed and it's gonna be

520
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:58,859
really happy there

521
00:22:55,500 --> 00:23:01,950
so we get into this problem of sometimes

522
00:22:58,859 --> 00:23:05,939
you know having healthy soil is not

523
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:07,740
enough yes so then what do we do so we

524
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:09,900
love the idea of putting out beneficial

525
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:12,058
insects we love the idea the green

526
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:13,620
lacewing cards are phenomenal they're

527
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:17,069
really cheap it takes care of the

528
00:23:13,619 --> 00:23:18,779
majority of your pests but you know now

529
00:23:17,069 --> 00:23:21,418
you invite all your friends over from

530
00:23:18,779 --> 00:23:23,308
the dump your collective and everybody

531
00:23:21,419 --> 00:23:25,440
walks through without thinking about the

532
00:23:23,308 --> 00:23:26,639
fact that they you know walked in their

533
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,769
own garden that morning and now

534
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:31,290
everybody has all the bugs that

535
00:23:28,769 --> 00:23:34,410
everybody else has yes it's definitely a

536
00:23:31,289 --> 00:23:36,418
thing that happens it is you know I love

537
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:38,220
the idea that or the ability that I have

538
00:23:36,419 --> 00:23:40,679
now to show off my farm but I also do

539
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:42,220
recognize the fact that you know more

540
00:23:40,679 --> 00:23:44,559
than likely that's where a lot of our

541
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:46,538
pest problems come from other farms I

542
00:23:44,558 --> 00:23:48,158
have this amazing cutting of this crazy

543
00:23:46,538 --> 00:23:49,808
cultivar that everybody wants and I'm

544
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:51,549
gonna gift it to you but I didn't scope

545
00:23:49,808 --> 00:23:57,548
it and it's got wrested mites and now

546
00:23:51,548 --> 00:23:58,900
you have yes so what do you do when you

547
00:23:57,548 --> 00:24:01,150
figure out that you're like oh shoot I

548
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:03,340
wasn't scouting properly I didn't pay

549
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:05,380
attention and now I have rest mites and

550
00:24:03,339 --> 00:24:07,449
I can see them with my visible eye so

551
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:10,150
now we have a serious got a problem yeah

552
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:12,159
and I can't afford to cut down my cash

553
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:15,070
crop and burn it and start over because

554
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:18,100
my season doesn't work that way so this

555
00:24:15,069 --> 00:24:20,200
is when pesticides come in right this is

556
00:24:18,099 --> 00:24:24,939
when your traditional farmer turns to

557
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:27,400
Eagle 20 or avid or flora mite or

558
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:29,769
whatever the other crazy gnarly

559
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:32,759
chemicals are because they can't afford

560
00:24:29,769 --> 00:24:36,548
to do anything else or so they think

561
00:24:32,759 --> 00:24:39,279
right so what do we as natural farmers

562
00:24:36,548 --> 00:24:40,750
do when we're at this problem like you

563
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:44,639
know a lot of people just they're like

564
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:47,679
oh I bought 500 million ladybugs and

565
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:49,570
released him and they all flew away yes

566
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:52,179
and then the ones that stayed pooped all

567
00:24:49,569 --> 00:24:54,428
over my weed and now I can't sell it so

568
00:24:52,179 --> 00:24:56,500
this is where we kind of really got deep

569
00:24:54,429 --> 00:24:57,880
into the G DOM and into like there's got

570
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:59,558
to be better solutions and there has to

571
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:01,539
be ways that we can do this economically

572
00:24:59,558 --> 00:25:03,220
there's some products that are available

573
00:25:01,538 --> 00:25:06,808
that work really well but they're just

574
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:09,610
they're ridiculously expensive mm-hmm

575
00:25:06,808 --> 00:25:12,158
so the JWA we talked about that's your

576
00:25:09,609 --> 00:25:16,889
wetting agent mm hm it does work pretty

577
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:20,320
well on its own somewhat so Microsoft

578
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:22,990
some of the aphids you know but the hop

579
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:24,490
a Fedor the what might be the hop a

580
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:28,929
Fedor the cannabis aphid whichever

581
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:31,750
varietal it is now that particular one

582
00:25:28,929 --> 00:25:33,669
just breeds so damn fast that even as

583
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:36,819
you're killing it it's it's hard to keep

584
00:25:33,669 --> 00:25:38,679
ahead of it with just JWA so then we

585
00:25:36,819 --> 00:25:41,470
bring in the other two solutions that I

586
00:25:38,679 --> 00:25:43,650
love so Joe Tom sulfur solution it's

587
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:47,620
made similarly to the wetting agent and

588
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:51,970
again it doesn't have the that's usually

589
00:25:47,619 --> 00:25:54,459
made with lime to create the heat the

590
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:55,100
problem with the sulfur that you buy on

591
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:58,100
the mark

592
00:25:55,099 --> 00:26:01,219
nowadays is that because of the process

593
00:25:58,099 --> 00:26:03,409
that is used it takes it from its

594
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:05,419
elemental sulfur farm into if I'm

595
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:07,940
understanding correctly and again it's

596
00:26:05,419 --> 00:26:11,360
in Spanish so it might be totally

597
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:13,160
butchering but translations but if I'm

598
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:17,149
understanding correctly the process that

599
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:19,308
it goes through that industrial AG to

600
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:24,860
create these wettable sulfur powders and

601
00:26:19,308 --> 00:26:28,190
these which sulfur agents right changes

602
00:26:24,859 --> 00:26:31,369
the the form of sulfur so it actually

603
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:33,710
can cause resistance in pests so now you

604
00:26:31,369 --> 00:26:36,229
have superbugs that are resistant to

605
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:39,909
your sulfur because unfortunately as

606
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:41,900
cannabis growers most of us don't have

607
00:26:39,909 --> 00:26:43,610
horticultural backgrounds we're not

608
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:45,950
trained in how to use these products

609
00:26:43,609 --> 00:26:49,158
correctly we don't use them at the right

610
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:50,990
ratios or the right time frames and so

611
00:26:49,159 --> 00:26:53,539
you know just like what we saw with

612
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:55,339
spider mites in the you know late 90s

613
00:26:53,538 --> 00:26:58,308
early 2000 reading bugs that are

614
00:26:55,339 --> 00:26:59,750
resistant to the 3d code of crazy spider

615
00:26:58,308 --> 00:27:02,418
mites that were like next to impossible

616
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:05,950
to get rid of which is why the flora

617
00:27:02,419 --> 00:27:09,080
might of the world got really popular so

618
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:11,480
this sulfur solution it's not doing that

619
00:27:09,079 --> 00:27:17,558
you're you're you're creating you're

620
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:19,669
doing it yourself and and it's using oh

621
00:27:17,558 --> 00:27:22,250
my gosh I'm totally blanking on the

622
00:27:19,669 --> 00:27:27,190
recipe now because I've only done it

623
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:30,200
once any rate any informations out there

624
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:35,929
recipes there and again this is the

625
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:40,308
jadam sulfur solution okay jf JJ yes

626
00:27:35,929 --> 00:27:41,630
Saddam sulfur so jsj is and and so the

627
00:27:40,308 --> 00:27:43,069
great thing about all of this stuff is

628
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:44,990
that like you know you use it at such

629
00:27:43,069 --> 00:27:47,210
dilute ratios that you can make it once

630
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:49,400
and and then its shelf stable forever

631
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:50,900
and so like I said like why not make 50

632
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:52,250
gallons of wetting agent I mean you'll

633
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:55,100
use it eventually and it doesn't go mad

634
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:58,069
mm-hmm so dom sulfur same thing like you

635
00:27:55,099 --> 00:28:02,029
use it at very dilute ratios and it's

636
00:27:58,069 --> 00:28:04,759
it's it just it works super well I'm

637
00:28:02,029 --> 00:28:06,649
loving it super well and because of the

638
00:28:04,759 --> 00:28:07,490
fact that it stays in its elemental form

639
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:10,309
somewhat

640
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:12,769
as far as I understand the bugs are not

641
00:28:10,308 --> 00:28:15,500
able to create the resistance to it you

642
00:28:12,769 --> 00:28:18,889
can use it every day if you have a heavy

643
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:21,769
emphasis in an hour before sunset is the

644
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:23,929
time that's I I think that the book says

645
00:28:21,769 --> 00:28:25,308
that you can use it anytime you want for

646
00:28:23,929 --> 00:28:26,899
me I'm not gonna spray anything on my

647
00:28:25,308 --> 00:28:29,119
plants in the heat of the day no it's

648
00:28:26,898 --> 00:28:30,829
just it's gonna be problematic and it's

649
00:28:29,119 --> 00:28:32,028
gonna dry up super fast so I might as

650
00:28:30,829 --> 00:28:34,278
well spray it when the sun's going down

651
00:28:32,028 --> 00:28:35,659
enough light that I can see enough

652
00:28:34,278 --> 00:28:40,038
humidity in the air that it doesn't

653
00:28:35,659 --> 00:28:42,110
dissipate too fast right and so I mean

654
00:28:40,038 --> 00:28:44,179
and we I didn't do it every day we did

655
00:28:42,109 --> 00:28:46,819
every other day for two weeks which was

656
00:28:44,179 --> 00:28:48,350
probably a bit of overkill but I saw no

657
00:28:46,819 --> 00:28:51,379
stress in the plant there was no fight

658
00:28:48,349 --> 00:28:55,219
or toxicity going on the Russert mites

659
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:58,159
that we had were I actually didn't do it

660
00:28:55,220 --> 00:29:00,919
with just the JWA and Jas I added the

661
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:04,880
JHS which is the third component okay so

662
00:29:00,919 --> 00:29:08,000
that's Zhu Dom herbal solution okay JHS

663
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:10,370
and that's one that you can get really

664
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,380
creative with there's a hundred there's

665
00:29:10,369 --> 00:29:15,288
another book out there called a hundred

666
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:17,299
herbs or something like that it's a it's

667
00:29:15,288 --> 00:29:20,240
the other Jaudon book the genomic is

668
00:29:17,298 --> 00:29:27,319
orange this one is green and is

669
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:29,630
impossible to find of course so he lists

670
00:29:27,319 --> 00:29:31,579
the hundred herbs that he recommends for

671
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:33,770
this a lot of them happen to be herbs

672
00:29:31,579 --> 00:29:36,230
that are like in Korea so like I can't

673
00:29:33,769 --> 00:29:39,980
get Korean Pasque flower I'm not really

674
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:40,579
wanting to use that anyway but we did so

675
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:43,880
the jurist

676
00:29:40,579 --> 00:29:47,449
Jerusalem artichoke was like I mean just

677
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:50,929
it's easy to grow it's easy to process

678
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:53,870
and it's I mean this this whole the way

679
00:29:50,929 --> 00:29:55,940
you do this super super simple you're

680
00:29:53,869 --> 00:29:57,769
putting it in a pressure cooker or a

681
00:29:55,940 --> 00:30:01,909
crock pot and you're just basically

682
00:29:57,769 --> 00:30:05,329
cooking it for eight hours on high heat

683
00:30:01,909 --> 00:30:07,700
and what you end up with is all those

684
00:30:05,329 --> 00:30:10,339
chemical compounds that have been

685
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:12,679
extracted out into your water and then

686
00:30:10,339 --> 00:30:15,709
you're adding it to your other solutions

687
00:30:12,679 --> 00:30:18,130
and it's just this amazing trifecta of I

688
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:21,419
mean we had a

689
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:22,690
hemp cultivator in Colorado that used a

690
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:26,320
garlic

691
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:28,840
I think JHS I'm not a fan of that one

692
00:30:26,319 --> 00:30:31,960
but because probably because I like

693
00:30:28,839 --> 00:30:33,519
garlic and why would I waste on that so

694
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:35,230
but you can do it with like hot peppers

695
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:38,038
you can do with garlic you can do with

696
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:40,360
ginkgo so the ginkgo leaves the

697
00:30:38,038 --> 00:30:41,200
Jerusalem artichoke and then we went

698
00:30:40,359 --> 00:30:44,589
off-script

699
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:46,330
and used california bay laurel and i do

700
00:30:44,589 --> 00:30:47,619
need to talk with Chris because he says

701
00:30:46,329 --> 00:30:52,119
that I have something wrong in my

702
00:30:47,619 --> 00:30:53,949
thinking about how it works but I also

703
00:30:52,119 --> 00:30:55,418
know that Korea doesn't have California

704
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:58,000
Bay laurels they don't have laurel trees

705
00:30:55,419 --> 00:31:01,000
so this wasn't something that they had

706
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:03,849
access to to trial out so there but I

707
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:06,640
might be missing something and I'll find

708
00:31:03,849 --> 00:31:09,459
out soon what that is this person Chris

709
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:18,130
his last name was hunt Trump Trump no

710
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:20,169
relation and he is a bunch of YouTube

711
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:23,770
videos on how to make the Korean

712
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:26,380
national farming inputs there's nuances

713
00:31:23,769 --> 00:31:28,900
and there are really key aspects that

714
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:30,730
are missing in those videos I watched

715
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:34,179
them all and like did this for a year

716
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:39,640
and it was just like this is amazing did

717
00:31:34,179 --> 00:31:42,519
it totally wrong it was good and so you

718
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:44,140
would view the JDAM book the orange one

719
00:31:42,519 --> 00:31:45,908
you mentioned as sort of the

720
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:48,640
authoritative description of these

721
00:31:45,909 --> 00:31:50,169
various preparations absolutely and

722
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:52,659
again the only thing he's missing in

723
00:31:50,169 --> 00:31:54,490
that book as far as I know so far is he

724
00:31:52,659 --> 00:31:58,750
does not mention personal protective

725
00:31:54,490 --> 00:32:00,190
gear PPE so when you're you know so the

726
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:02,140
first time we started doing we open the

727
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:04,120
potassium hydroxide and it like kind of

728
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:07,059
you know has some dust and we're like

729
00:32:04,119 --> 00:32:09,129
mmm yeah we have goggles and we have

730
00:32:07,058 --> 00:32:11,019
gloves and we have you know hoodies and

731
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:14,710
long sleeves but we didn't think about a

732
00:32:11,019 --> 00:32:16,629
dust mask so it became really apparent

733
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:19,240
in about 10 seconds that we had to go

734
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:20,710
get a dust mask yes so the same thing

735
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:22,990
with a do dahm sulfur he doesn't tell

736
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:25,210
you like you know really gear yourself

737
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:27,700
up cuz the stuff gets hot it's it is

738
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:29,210
noxious these aren't pleasant things to

739
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:33,080
work with

740
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:35,058
and the JHS also that was my first one

741
00:32:33,079 --> 00:32:36,888
with the Janome was the herbal solution

742
00:32:35,058 --> 00:32:42,499
that I did myself out of it they Laurel

743
00:32:36,888 --> 00:32:43,519
and oh my god that stuff so the

744
00:32:42,499 --> 00:32:44,808
interesting thing I did a bunch of

745
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:46,819
research first and I'm like there's a

746
00:32:44,808 --> 00:32:51,168
compound called eugenol that's contained

747
00:32:46,819 --> 00:32:52,819
in clothes in Laurel and clove is one of

748
00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:55,999
the compounds that is recommended in the

749
00:32:52,819 --> 00:32:58,428
genomics on well if the eugenol is the

750
00:32:55,999 --> 00:32:59,960
actual property that is pesticidal it's

751
00:32:58,429 --> 00:33:02,389
in our Bay laurels as well it should be

752
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:04,308
about the same so I picked a ton of

753
00:33:02,388 --> 00:33:05,898
leaves and I put him in the crock pot

754
00:33:04,308 --> 00:33:08,239
and i weighted it down with these rocks

755
00:33:05,898 --> 00:33:11,768
and I let it cook and it was inside the

756
00:33:08,239 --> 00:33:15,169
house oh yeah that was a bad choice

757
00:33:11,769 --> 00:33:17,628
after about 20 minutes you could not go

758
00:33:15,169 --> 00:33:20,778
inside like the the very air would like

759
00:33:17,628 --> 00:33:22,759
just set off all the mucus membranes I

760
00:33:20,778 --> 00:33:27,200
mean my nose was running my clients were

761
00:33:22,759 --> 00:33:29,719
watering yeah it worse so much worse

762
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:32,298
like really highly concentrated bay

763
00:33:29,719 --> 00:33:33,710
laurel smell yeah because if you take

764
00:33:32,298 --> 00:33:36,288
those leaves and crush them it's a very

765
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:38,358
strong almost menthol II kind of smell

766
00:33:36,288 --> 00:33:40,548
very strong so and that's the eugenol

767
00:33:38,358 --> 00:33:46,699
yeah and so now imagine that you took

768
00:33:40,548 --> 00:33:47,929
you know so I decided I was like this

769
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:49,489
isn't gonna fly we're gonna move this

770
00:33:47,929 --> 00:33:52,009
thing outside so I got my extension cord

771
00:33:49,489 --> 00:33:54,048
and I my crock-pot my pressure cooker is

772
00:33:52,009 --> 00:33:55,729
an instant pot so it's worked great

773
00:33:54,048 --> 00:33:57,588
don't think great I love it

774
00:33:55,729 --> 00:33:59,690
I need to buy a new one because this

775
00:33:57,588 --> 00:34:02,088
one's fairly ruined now

776
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:04,629
uh-huh so I picked it up and I took it

777
00:34:02,088 --> 00:34:09,318
outside and I set it down and the little

778
00:34:04,628 --> 00:34:11,239
steam vent bit and one little tiny drip

779
00:34:09,318 --> 00:34:14,148
and it had only been in there for maybe

780
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:16,699
half an hour landed right there on my

781
00:34:14,148 --> 00:34:19,009
cheek and I was like oh it's fine I'll

782
00:34:16,699 --> 00:34:21,138
just plug this in and you know and it's

783
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:22,909
outside now and I started trying to plug

784
00:34:21,139 --> 00:34:24,108
the the pot back in and I was trying to

785
00:34:22,909 --> 00:34:25,700
push the buttons and all this and I was

786
00:34:24,108 --> 00:34:28,960
like oh my god it's burning and I was

787
00:34:25,699 --> 00:34:32,298
like oh my god it's really burning I

788
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:34,909
tried not some temperature not from heat

789
00:34:32,298 --> 00:34:37,038
yes I had to affirm the essential oils

790
00:34:34,909 --> 00:34:39,079
that were in that bay leaf that were now

791
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:40,710
extracted into the water that just

792
00:34:39,079 --> 00:34:44,220
flipped up out of the little steam

793
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:52,179
so that was my first like yeah

794
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:53,739
protective gear yeah yeah so yeah I

795
00:34:52,179 --> 00:34:55,960
dropped everything I ran inside I like

796
00:34:53,739 --> 00:34:57,669
washed my face I wash my face again and

797
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:58,300
then I started thinking about oh my god

798
00:34:57,670 --> 00:35:01,720
okay

799
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:04,180
this was oil-based so should I get the

800
00:35:01,719 --> 00:35:06,189
baking soda or the baking powder or do I

801
00:35:04,179 --> 00:35:07,329
grab a cucumber or is it milk and at

802
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:10,900
that point I was like getting a little

803
00:35:07,329 --> 00:35:12,610
bit stressed because I think I just

804
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:14,650
ended up like using tech new I think it

805
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:18,640
was and washing it off and that seemed

806
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:19,930
to do it yeah the closest thing in my

807
00:35:18,639 --> 00:35:22,739
bathroom that I could think of to use

808
00:35:19,929 --> 00:35:25,869
and so but it was interesting because

809
00:35:22,739 --> 00:35:27,909
you know half an hour was all so now

810
00:35:25,869 --> 00:35:29,980
after eight eight hours it's pretty

811
00:35:27,909 --> 00:35:32,049
potent I'm pulling the rocks out and at

812
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:33,940
this point I'm ready I was like my

813
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:37,330
respirator and I've got big huge kitchen

814
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:39,789
gloves on and and the protective

815
00:35:37,329 --> 00:35:42,549
eyeglasses which have holes in the

816
00:35:39,789 --> 00:35:44,110
bottom of them Oh No yeah yeah because I

817
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:45,850
guess they want you to not fog up or

818
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:47,200
something I don't know so yeah I'm

819
00:35:45,849 --> 00:35:49,630
saying they're like okay I'm totally

820
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:51,759
ready this time and I started pouring it

821
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:53,320
into the jars because this is another

822
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,610
one that's shelf stable if you pour it

823
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,390
all the way up and you seal it while

824
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:57,070
it's really hot

825
00:35:55,389 --> 00:35:58,599
it'll self seal you don't have to

826
00:35:57,070 --> 00:36:00,760
pressure-cook it our hot water bath it

827
00:35:58,599 --> 00:36:04,210
or anything and then you can you know

828
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:06,460
use it much later down the line so I'm

829
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:09,519
pouring it in and it's just like I I was

830
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:12,730
having the worst time because the scent

831
00:36:09,519 --> 00:36:16,210
was so strong and I mean it was like

832
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:19,360
absolutely burning my eyes and it was it

833
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:21,250
was I was very impressed at this point I

834
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:23,500
was like okay this what I don't even

835
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:25,869
know if this is right or not but this is

836
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:27,039
an impressive like if I was a bug I

837
00:36:25,869 --> 00:36:31,869
would not want that anywhere near me

838
00:36:27,039 --> 00:36:33,909
yeah so a great story about how

839
00:36:31,869 --> 00:36:38,589
important personal protective gear can

840
00:36:33,909 --> 00:36:39,639
be so have a question at least one more

841
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:41,289
if you don't mind

842
00:36:39,639 --> 00:36:47,049
yeah I'm really appreciating this

843
00:36:41,289 --> 00:36:49,269
information the JWA as a wedding agent

844
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:52,269
I'm imagining you know you've you've

845
00:36:49,269 --> 00:36:54,318
made 50 gallons of this soap

846
00:36:52,269 --> 00:36:56,958
you only need

847
00:36:54,318 --> 00:36:59,599
what a teaspoon of it in a gallon a

848
00:36:56,958 --> 00:37:03,438
couple of drops in a gallon to make a

849
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:05,869
spray so it depends and there seems to

850
00:37:03,438 --> 00:37:07,728
be there's a in the Jaedong book he

851
00:37:05,869 --> 00:37:11,838
actually talks about infestation rates

852
00:37:07,728 --> 00:37:14,868
okay so if you're just using it as a

853
00:37:11,838 --> 00:37:19,038
wetting agent preventatively it's it's

854
00:37:14,869 --> 00:37:21,650
very dilute I believe it's like

855
00:37:19,039 --> 00:37:26,390
somewhere the 1 to 100 or 1 to 50 yeah

856
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:27,528
like an ounce to a gallon yeah I mean

857
00:37:26,389 --> 00:37:33,949
maybe about that much I guess actually

858
00:37:27,528 --> 00:37:36,018
yeah that'd be 128 to 1 yeah like a low

859
00:37:33,949 --> 00:37:38,778
so it might even be less than the 1 to

860
00:37:36,018 --> 00:37:42,818
100 I don't well that's a prophylactic I

861
00:37:38,778 --> 00:37:42,818
could see it being pretty pretty small

862
00:37:43,179 --> 00:37:49,068
increase in pest pressure and

863
00:37:46,219 --> 00:37:51,168
infestation his recommended dosage goes

864
00:37:49,068 --> 00:37:55,009
up okay and it's the same thing with the

865
00:37:51,168 --> 00:37:57,558
JHS that was my question yeah so we

866
00:37:55,009 --> 00:37:59,929
found so the first time I tried it I

867
00:37:57,559 --> 00:38:04,039
didn't have the JWA yet all I had was JH

868
00:37:59,929 --> 00:38:07,159
s and I just tried it on my infested

869
00:38:04,039 --> 00:38:09,999
brassicas okay I had a some type of a

870
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:09,999
food I'm not

871
00:38:12,219 --> 00:38:18,019
and it was covering my kale it was I was

872
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,729
like alright well let's check this out

873
00:38:18,018 --> 00:38:22,008
and I'm gonna start it at a very dilute

874
00:38:19,728 --> 00:38:24,108
ratio because having known what that

875
00:38:22,009 --> 00:38:27,159
splatter was like I just don't think I

876
00:38:24,108 --> 00:38:30,739
need a lot so I did it at 1 to 100 and

877
00:38:27,159 --> 00:38:32,838
it was I mean it was very impressive I

878
00:38:30,739 --> 00:38:35,568
had about a 60% mortality with one

879
00:38:32,838 --> 00:38:37,759
spring Wow and so I came back the next

880
00:38:35,568 --> 00:38:39,858
day and I was like ah was pretty cool

881
00:38:37,759 --> 00:38:41,838
alright let's see let's you know crank

882
00:38:39,858 --> 00:38:44,598
it up a little bit more and so I think

883
00:38:41,838 --> 00:38:48,349
the next one I did was a 1 to 50 ratio

884
00:38:44,599 --> 00:38:51,709
and I also had spider mites at that time

885
00:38:48,349 --> 00:38:54,539
on my violas and this is the JH s just

886
00:38:51,708 --> 00:38:57,899
without the JWA no JWA I didn't

887
00:38:54,539 --> 00:39:00,659
any wedding agent didn't use the job

888
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:03,000
sulfur none of that and so the second

889
00:39:00,659 --> 00:39:05,969
spray at the one to 50 on the aphids

890
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,739
killed everything attached so there was

891
00:39:05,969 --> 00:39:09,149
some aphids that was a it was a curly

892
00:39:07,739 --> 00:39:10,919
kale so they were like some of them were

893
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:12,720
tucked up in it and they didn't do

894
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:15,180
anything to those ones but I mean it was

895
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:18,119
just it was it was really crazy

896
00:39:15,179 --> 00:39:20,909
the spider mites on the violas it didn't

897
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:22,559
work on those I was like okay I mean it

898
00:39:20,909 --> 00:39:24,449
maybe did a little bit but not so

899
00:39:22,559 --> 00:39:26,699
significant not so effective as it was

900
00:39:24,449 --> 00:39:29,129
with the aphids yeah okay so at that

901
00:39:26,699 --> 00:39:31,559
point then a friend was coming over and

902
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:32,700
we're like let's make JWA and neither of

903
00:39:31,559 --> 00:39:34,199
us have done it before so were like

904
00:39:32,699 --> 00:39:35,939
we're gonna make like you know a hundred

905
00:39:34,199 --> 00:39:39,389
gallons he's gonna take 50 with him and

906
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:42,389
I'll have my 50 here and so when that

907
00:39:39,389 --> 00:39:45,029
was done I went back and tried that with

908
00:39:42,389 --> 00:39:48,389
the JHS on the spider mites again and

909
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:50,519
there was if something happened again I

910
00:39:48,389 --> 00:39:54,900
was like no if I'm super impressed with

911
00:39:50,519 --> 00:39:56,759
that yeah yeah and at that point then we

912
00:39:54,900 --> 00:40:01,349
were talking with Tina who was who was

913
00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:02,850
adding J's a sulfur and she had resin

914
00:40:01,349 --> 00:40:05,190
mites and she all she had was the Janome

915
00:40:02,849 --> 00:40:06,929
sulfur so we started communicating and

916
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:08,940
she was like okay I'm gonna make the JWA

917
00:40:06,929 --> 00:40:10,109
and I'm gonna make the JHS and I'm gonna

918
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:11,880
do with garlic because that's what I

919
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:17,539
have and I think she did chili peppers

920
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:20,760
and and so she did the three of them and

921
00:40:17,539 --> 00:40:23,070
together within I think it was like it

922
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:25,140
was a very short period of time like two

923
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:27,690
weeks basically she was just like we

924
00:40:25,139 --> 00:40:31,289
have full eradication like this is like

925
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:33,690
it's it's killing one thing and another

926
00:40:31,289 --> 00:40:38,369
friend of ours was also doing it he did

927
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:40,500
the california bay laurel JHS maybe

928
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:43,529
ginkgo but i don't really recall for

929
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:45,989
sure if he used that and then the Jas

930
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:48,240
and the JWA he used um at much higher

931
00:40:45,989 --> 00:40:50,219
concentrations than we had done and

932
00:40:48,239 --> 00:40:52,439
found that his plants didn't suffer at

933
00:40:50,219 --> 00:40:55,529
all and again he had pretty much

934
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:58,260
eradication of the

935
00:40:55,530 --> 00:41:02,220
that is so spectacular for something you

936
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:04,590
can make on your farm and pennies per

937
00:41:02,219 --> 00:41:08,339
gallon yeah I mean once it's diluted its

938
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:10,350
I mean it's just phenomenal and I love

939
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:11,940
that it is that you know that you're not

940
00:41:10,349 --> 00:41:14,909
gonna have to be concerned about

941
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:16,619
residual breakdown products that you

942
00:41:14,909 --> 00:41:19,469
might with some of the store-bought

943
00:41:16,619 --> 00:41:22,529
products that you might think are going

944
00:41:19,469 --> 00:41:25,379
to be a better answer I really I'm

945
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:29,880
really struck by the the description

946
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:31,590
you've given me this evening and for me

947
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:34,230
to like a big part of it is especially

948
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:36,420
with cannabis in California and a lot of

949
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:38,400
the states the testing is so regulated

950
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:41,369
that like I might buy something that

951
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:43,170
says that it's you know clove oil and

952
00:41:41,369 --> 00:41:45,210
rosemary and you know all these

953
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:46,980
wonderful little natural things but then

954
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:48,929
they slide pyrethrins in because it

955
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:50,309
works really well and they maybe they're

956
00:41:48,929 --> 00:41:52,559
like oh it's maybe you don't know that

957
00:41:50,309 --> 00:41:54,659
it's chrysanthemum and so you read it

958
00:41:52,559 --> 00:41:56,460
and you think you're okay or maybe they

959
00:41:54,659 --> 00:41:59,009
just don't even say it on the label like

960
00:41:56,460 --> 00:42:02,579
if I'm making it myself because no you

961
00:41:59,010 --> 00:42:04,980
know what's there yeah I know exactly if

962
00:42:02,579 --> 00:42:06,690
I know the plant and if I know the what

963
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:10,500
I'm extracting out of it I know that I

964
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:12,750
can use eugenol so I know that I'm good

965
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:14,519
to go on that I guess oleander I don't

966
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:16,639
really know what the active ingredient

967
00:42:14,519 --> 00:42:18,449
that's just a sidle in there i

968
00:42:16,639 --> 00:42:20,730
chrysanthemum is one of them that is

969
00:42:18,449 --> 00:42:22,319
recommended I know I cannot use that

970
00:42:20,730 --> 00:42:24,719
because I know that's pyrethrin and I

971
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:27,180
know that's restricted but if you know

972
00:42:24,719 --> 00:42:29,009
what your restrictions are and you you

973
00:42:27,179 --> 00:42:31,019
know go through these herbs and you know

974
00:42:29,010 --> 00:42:32,970
that like capsaicin is your effective

975
00:42:31,019 --> 00:42:35,280
ingredient in hot peppers right so I

976
00:42:32,969 --> 00:42:37,049
know that that's okay to use right so

977
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:39,120
this becomes something that I have full

978
00:42:37,050 --> 00:42:41,460
control over yeah everything I'm doing

979
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:43,920
on my farm yes making it myself

980
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:45,150
I have no secondary gases people like

981
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:50,430
how you know you're gonna pass

982
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:52,940
pesticides I'm like because I made it

983
00:42:50,429 --> 00:42:56,609
and I didn't put it in it it's not

984
00:42:52,940 --> 00:43:00,090
exactly I really loved also that you in

985
00:42:56,610 --> 00:43:02,370
in taking on using these preparations

986
00:43:00,090 --> 00:43:05,039
you first started off with crops that

987
00:43:02,369 --> 00:43:07,028
maybe not so valuable to you as starting

988
00:43:05,039 --> 00:43:11,019
right off with your cannabis

989
00:43:07,028 --> 00:43:19,000
which much respect for the wisdom of

990
00:43:11,019 --> 00:43:22,179
that I am grateful I am going to find

991
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:23,710
out more about JDM and whatnot like I

992
00:43:22,179 --> 00:43:26,710
said I'd like to educate myself a little

993
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:30,190
more fully on the things that I've

994
00:43:26,710 --> 00:43:34,750
already been doing in some ways mostly

995
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:37,329
because for myself I like I say I've

996
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:39,639
done some reading but really in sitting

997
00:43:37,329 --> 00:43:41,619
in the garden and trying to understand

998
00:43:39,639 --> 00:43:44,528
what I'm seeing and what's going on

999
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:47,588
there I keep coming back to there that

1000
00:43:44,528 --> 00:43:49,900
that the plants that are here can

1001
00:43:47,588 --> 00:43:52,690
provide the answers to the problems or

1002
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:56,588
questions that I have is simply me being

1003
00:43:52,690 --> 00:43:59,349
open to them telling me what to do

1004
00:43:56,588 --> 00:44:01,328
if you it's all funny to go there but it

1005
00:43:59,349 --> 00:44:07,390
doesn't know but something like that I

1006
00:44:01,329 --> 00:44:09,250
totally agree I you know I mean like you

1007
00:44:07,389 --> 00:44:12,548
can teach processes to people but you

1008
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:16,239
can't teach that communication you can't

1009
00:44:12,548 --> 00:44:18,670
teach I mean I don't know it's it's

1010
00:44:16,239 --> 00:44:20,919
funny to me to meet people that you know

1011
00:44:18,670 --> 00:44:22,389
they're like oh I I can't tell what's

1012
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:24,150
wrong with that plant and I'm like you

1013
00:44:22,389 --> 00:44:28,568
can't tell that that's a zinc deficiency

1014
00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:30,400
or exotic I mean I just you know I mean

1015
00:44:28,568 --> 00:44:32,980
I you see all the marijuana magazines

1016
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:35,410
now that have all the pictures of things

1017
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:38,380
that I'm like oh yeah that was your ad

1018
00:44:35,409 --> 00:44:41,828
oh my god you don't see the pH imbalance

1019
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:44,079
that's showing with those whoo okay yes

1020
00:44:41,829 --> 00:44:45,970
and it's just it's just rampant I've

1021
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:49,180
seen there's no farming industry out

1022
00:44:45,969 --> 00:44:52,858
there where like people don't know what

1023
00:44:49,179 --> 00:44:52,858
they're doing the way that there is

1024
00:44:53,519 --> 00:44:58,960
there there isn't that communication

1025
00:44:56,798 --> 00:45:00,849
there isn't that I mean like you know if

1026
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:02,440
you're a really good weed farmer you're

1027
00:45:00,849 --> 00:45:05,349
out there like just chilling with your

1028
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:07,059
plants all the time and you just you see

1029
00:45:05,349 --> 00:45:08,318
the things that are there so much faster

1030
00:45:07,059 --> 00:45:10,359
and you're in

1031
00:45:08,318 --> 00:45:12,068
and again like I don't know for me just

1032
00:45:10,358 --> 00:45:13,808
taking it to that spirituality level

1033
00:45:12,068 --> 00:45:15,920
like you're outside where it's meant to

1034
00:45:13,809 --> 00:45:17,930
be and there you're in this space

1035
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:19,280
where there's there is polyculture and

1036
00:45:17,929 --> 00:45:20,868
there are those other things going on

1037
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:23,119
and sometimes there indicator plants

1038
00:45:20,869 --> 00:45:25,369
where you're just like ooh yes you don't

1039
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:27,829
look good and I know that you're a

1040
00:45:25,369 --> 00:45:30,079
delicate little whatever you are and so

1041
00:45:27,829 --> 00:45:32,329
if you're not looking good you guys are

1042
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:34,519
probably not feeling so good either so

1043
00:45:32,329 --> 00:45:36,740
now I know how to treat everybody and I

1044
00:45:34,519 --> 00:45:40,389
love that one of the things you

1045
00:45:36,739 --> 00:45:43,848
mentioned is a concept of banker plants

1046
00:45:40,389 --> 00:45:46,699
love that whole principle as a way of

1047
00:45:43,849 --> 00:45:48,079
just being aware and it's I've come to

1048
00:45:46,699 --> 00:45:52,250
realize that actually there's plants

1049
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:55,068
that one can use to see what the state

1050
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:57,170
the soil is moisture content in the soil

1051
00:45:55,068 --> 00:46:01,730
etcetera etcetera

1052
00:45:57,170 --> 00:46:06,858
in addition to the benefits that can

1053
00:46:01,730 --> 00:46:09,619
happen for cover cropping or all of the

1054
00:46:06,858 --> 00:46:11,779
other reasons to have other plants in

1055
00:46:09,619 --> 00:46:20,809
your garden I don't know if that made

1056
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:22,339
any sense at all I don't feel like we

1057
00:46:20,809 --> 00:46:24,410
have much trouble with moisture content

1058
00:46:22,338 --> 00:46:28,460
we've just got great soil that yeah

1059
00:46:24,409 --> 00:46:30,529
deals with things really well but but

1060
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:34,338
yeah like things that would show wilting

1061
00:46:30,530 --> 00:46:37,490
first yeah the a friend who has a

1062
00:46:34,338 --> 00:46:39,920
nursery commercial nursery gifted me

1063
00:46:37,489 --> 00:46:42,139
some seeds recently and I am ashamed to

1064
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:45,139
say that I don't remember what he called

1065
00:46:42,139 --> 00:46:48,139
them but he says that they they really

1066
00:46:45,139 --> 00:46:48,739
like being in the shade of a cannabis

1067
00:46:48,139 --> 00:46:52,848
plant

1068
00:46:48,739 --> 00:46:55,759
and meantime they will droop do that

1069
00:46:52,849 --> 00:46:58,220
droop thing before your cannabis plants

1070
00:46:55,760 --> 00:47:00,109
do because by the time your cannabis

1071
00:46:58,219 --> 00:47:02,298
plants are drooping you've gone a little

1072
00:47:00,108 --> 00:47:04,759
too long I'm not happy about it and

1073
00:47:02,298 --> 00:47:07,509
you've hurt the roots and yes you can

1074
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:09,799
water them in the perk right back up but

1075
00:47:07,510 --> 00:47:12,290
anticipating the needs without having to

1076
00:47:09,798 --> 00:47:13,818
you know every four times a day you're

1077
00:47:12,289 --> 00:47:15,318
down on your hands and knees digging in

1078
00:47:13,818 --> 00:47:17,329
the dirt making sure everything's still

1079
00:47:15,318 --> 00:47:22,190
good because it's really hot today and

1080
00:47:17,329 --> 00:47:24,349
there's a breeze and and I have to say

1081
00:47:22,190 --> 00:47:26,838
honestly a part of what I'm loving about

1082
00:47:24,349 --> 00:47:28,510
this not just the decrease in the cost

1083
00:47:26,838 --> 00:47:30,699
and the knowing what you

1084
00:47:28,510 --> 00:47:34,270
that you're putting on your plants but

1085
00:47:30,699 --> 00:47:37,089
there's just the involvement the the

1086
00:47:34,269 --> 00:47:39,009
extent to which you're there gathering

1087
00:47:37,090 --> 00:47:41,019
those bay leaves you're there or

1088
00:47:39,010 --> 00:47:42,520
measuring out those various materials

1089
00:47:41,019 --> 00:47:45,250
you're putting into this mix you're

1090
00:47:42,519 --> 00:47:48,009
there holding that variable speed drill

1091
00:47:45,250 --> 00:47:50,260
running this paddle mixer dealing with

1092
00:47:48,010 --> 00:47:54,160
the smell and knowing that what you're

1093
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:56,500
doing is going to be enhancing your

1094
00:47:54,159 --> 00:47:59,259
garden and to me this is this is where

1095
00:47:56,500 --> 00:48:01,420
intention comes into our work and the

1096
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:03,010
importance of who you are and the

1097
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:08,380
integrity you bring to what you're doing

1098
00:48:03,010 --> 00:48:09,250
I love you yeah I just got to say that's

1099
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:11,320
so lovely

1100
00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:13,420
thank you look at you tying that full

1101
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:16,019
conversation into one of the key words

1102
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:16,019
of today
