1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:08,339
so let's talk some light right okay so

2
00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:10,400
but people what people sorta forget is

3
00:00:08,339 --> 00:00:13,379
that when the sunlight hits that plant

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:16,260
50 to 60 percent of the photosynthetic

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:18,089
energy is used not to produce the

6
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:20,850
cannabis flower not to produce the

7
00:00:18,089 --> 00:00:23,910
leaves of the stem but to produce carbon

8
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:26,970
extra days to drip out into the soil so

9
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:30,028
the quality of light has everything to

10
00:00:26,969 --> 00:00:31,979
do with the quality of the Exodus and

11
00:00:30,028 --> 00:00:33,750
the efficiency of the plant being able

12
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,929
to produce those exudates

13
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:38,850
okay those exudates are what to attract

14
00:00:36,929 --> 00:00:40,738
the bacteria and the fungi to feed the

15
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:44,129
plants you know blablabla teeming with

16
00:00:40,738 --> 00:00:47,929
microbes if you have bad light and you

17
00:00:44,128 --> 00:00:49,378
are not impacting the plant properly a

18
00:00:47,929 --> 00:00:51,780
bee

19
00:00:49,378 --> 00:00:53,570
some of these microbes are sensitive to

20
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:56,879
light some of these microbes are

21
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:58,920
photosynthetic some of these you know so

22
00:00:56,878 --> 00:01:01,558
that light has an impact on them as well

23
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:04,109
and the other members of the soil food

24
00:01:01,558 --> 00:01:06,329
web are impacted by the light in similar

25
00:01:04,109 --> 00:01:08,340
ways and they in turn have impacts on

26
00:01:06,329 --> 00:01:10,819
the microbes which end up so the whole

27
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:14,509
thing Cascades as a result of the Sun

28
00:01:10,819 --> 00:01:18,419
hitting that plant now if you use an LED

29
00:01:14,509 --> 00:01:20,969
it's missing green wavelengths because

30
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:22,228
most of them are green well the reason

31
00:01:20,969 --> 00:01:24,900
why they say that is because they can't

32
00:01:22,228 --> 00:01:27,000
produce it yeah so it's missing the

33
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:29,850
green flame well then you know that

34
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,469
means that deep down in that leaf there

35
00:01:29,849 --> 00:01:33,269
are chloroplasts that aren't operating

36
00:01:31,469 --> 00:01:35,400
the way they're supposed to yeah the

37
00:01:33,269 --> 00:01:37,920
ones on the top are but that green stuff

38
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:41,310
is a that's a wave and it goes into the

39
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,930
plant and it does stuff way down deep

40
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:46,649
you know and so if you're missing that

41
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:49,680
you got a problem and that's why I like

42
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:52,950
the plasma lamp because it's it's it was

43
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,710
invented specifically to mimic the sun's

44
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:57,000
spectrum

45
00:01:54,709 --> 00:01:58,169
sounds like a process of sitting there

46
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,659
for thousands of years

47
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:02,939
without Danny Hills well it's not just

48
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:05,640
yeah for everything and and and not just

49
00:02:02,938 --> 00:02:08,219
the plants but us as well I mean you

50
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:10,110
know we react to somebody you know I

51
00:02:08,219 --> 00:02:11,879
always I always think about people that

52
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:14,450
are out in there under the indoor grow

53
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:20,699
you know working under the LEDs and

54
00:02:14,449 --> 00:02:22,979
centers in the center you know no these

55
00:02:20,699 --> 00:02:24,750
are these are called a plasma light it's

56
00:02:22,979 --> 00:02:27,149
just like a plasma like you know there's

57
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:28,860
a special gas amount these are really

58
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:31,650
unbelievable the little teeny light they

59
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:34,140
report one light replaces five or six of

60
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:36,180
these you know big you know gravida type

61
00:02:34,139 --> 00:02:39,779
lights and what I like about this plasma

62
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:41,879
light is talk about to war let's assume

63
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:44,818
you want to go Durbin poison in Portland

64
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:49,379
Oregon you know or Anchorage Alaska well

65
00:02:44,818 --> 00:02:51,689
now we can dial in the exact sunlight we

66
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:55,049
can get the exact wavelength from Durban

67
00:02:51,689 --> 00:02:57,389
Africa latitude longitude dial it in on

68
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:59,760
this plasma lamp and give it that laughs

69
00:02:57,389 --> 00:03:01,919
and then get the soil from Durban get

70
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:03,509
the Seas from Durban bingo

71
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:05,939
plasma lights have been around for less

72
00:03:03,509 --> 00:03:09,030
and you used to have to have a you know

73
00:03:05,939 --> 00:03:11,459
a one for flowering with a bit no not

74
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:13,199
not with this one this the guy who's a

75
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:16,979
Swiss guy invented I just met him this

76
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:20,879
weekend and he his goal was to match the

77
00:03:16,979 --> 00:03:23,639
Sun so now when you test a solar panel

78
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:25,620
you use this light to test the solar

79
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:27,179
panel you don't have to use the Sun you

80
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,799
can test it in the factory there's

81
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:31,230
nothing else I know that does that

82
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,640
period now you know these are not cheap

83
00:03:31,229 --> 00:03:34,729
lights but the efficiency is

84
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:38,759
unbelievably last two three four hundred

85
00:03:34,729 --> 00:03:40,159
thousand hours and they use no wattage

86
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:46,889
as far as I know like in Massachusetts

87
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:51,120
scissor oh my god and no heat some

88
00:03:46,889 --> 00:03:52,289
believe they mimic the Sun but I mean

89
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,239
you know what the you'd have to be

90
00:03:52,289 --> 00:03:56,578
incited to get the heat the other thing

91
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:59,219
about it is it is that the form factor

92
00:03:56,579 --> 00:04:01,590
can be changed so that you can you know

93
00:03:59,219 --> 00:04:04,289
you can make it you can dependent the

94
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:05,229
boxes you know middle but you can make

95
00:04:04,289 --> 00:04:10,568
it

96
00:04:05,229 --> 00:04:13,000
for you to make it its patented its

97
00:04:10,568 --> 00:04:15,939
patented is being used and it's being

98
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:19,060
tested it's on the market it's being

99
00:04:15,939 --> 00:04:23,469
used for the film industry it's just as

100
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:24,490
a light it's being used growers growers

101
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:26,650
are using them

102
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:31,329
hospitals are testing them because of

103
00:04:26,649 --> 00:04:34,239
the menthol it has an HOH television you

104
00:04:31,329 --> 00:04:38,649
know venues because you feel good

105
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:41,019
Anderson so it's all not headlights out

106
00:04:38,649 --> 00:04:43,209
and what I can't get them to do yet but

107
00:04:41,019 --> 00:04:46,689
they're working on is to make a little

108
00:04:43,209 --> 00:04:49,750
teeny Marvel size one for my in hosts

109
00:04:46,689 --> 00:04:51,610
6x4 grow tent that's what we really

110
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:53,560
wanted i it's the only lead I know that

111
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:56,710
that I would ever use in Massachusetts

112
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:58,839
which has a wattage you know your

113
00:04:56,709 --> 00:05:09,248
stretcher

114
00:04:58,839 --> 00:05:09,248
