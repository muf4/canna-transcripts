1
00:00:09,189 --> 00:00:15,739
please welcome dr. Pierre frog's so I'm

2
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:17,990
delighted to be here truly it's a

3
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:20,210
wonderful city I'm really grateful that

4
00:00:17,989 --> 00:00:22,849
I did take a taxi this morning to get

5
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:25,219
here I'm on the same page as you are

6
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:27,650
with with the homelessness it's tragic

7
00:00:25,219 --> 00:00:28,969
to see and I'm really delighted that

8
00:00:27,649 --> 00:00:31,449
you're trying so hard to do something

9
00:00:28,969 --> 00:00:33,530
about it I think it's a real eye-opener

10
00:00:31,449 --> 00:00:36,409
not to say that we don't have the same

11
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:38,838
problem in in Canada but of course the

12
00:00:36,409 --> 00:00:40,759
snow and the cold does make it slightly

13
00:00:38,838 --> 00:00:42,829
different

14
00:00:40,759 --> 00:00:45,858
I'm also cloud proud to be here because

15
00:00:42,829 --> 00:00:48,079
I guess so who's a basketball guys here

16
00:00:45,859 --> 00:00:48,588
or ladies anybody follow basketball here

17
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,069
No

18
00:00:48,588 --> 00:00:53,600
so our star guy and the Raptors is here

19
00:00:52,069 --> 00:00:56,390
now right not too happy about that

20
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:59,149
that's that's really quite a shame so

21
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:01,189
I'm here for the next 2530 minutes to

22
00:00:59,149 --> 00:01:04,730
share with you uh-huh

23
00:01:01,189 --> 00:01:11,090
a little higher okay I'm here to share

24
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:14,450
with you my my experience as you know in

25
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:16,850
Canada we just recently legalized it

26
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:18,879
both for recreational as well as for

27
00:01:16,849 --> 00:01:24,589
medical purposes

28
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:27,469
we tried before and and we had in 2001

29
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:29,450
regulations that led to some some abuse

30
00:01:27,469 --> 00:01:31,760
of the regulations in terms of growing

31
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:33,770
and so on so then they changed it and

32
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:36,020
they the new regulations didn't allow

33
00:01:33,769 --> 00:01:40,459
for personal cultivation and then

34
00:01:36,019 --> 00:01:42,469
finally in 2016 I think we finally got

35
00:01:40,459 --> 00:01:44,719
it right so a lot of what I'm going to

36
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:47,329
present to you today is an offshoot of

37
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:49,750
that a lot of the work that I do is in

38
00:01:47,329 --> 00:01:52,730
nursing homes and of course even though

39
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:56,420
cannabis for medical use is legal in

40
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:58,609
Canada since 2016 as you can expect in

41
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:02,090
nursing homes policies had to be built

42
00:01:58,609 --> 00:02:04,280
around the use so the data I have to

43
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:07,609
present to you is limited on account of

44
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:10,628
that but nevertheless I think it speaks

45
00:02:07,609 --> 00:02:10,628
volumes about where

46
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:19,860
since it became an open field so we say

47
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:22,080
the number of LPS has has grown in fact

48
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:24,840
I have here 194 I think that recently

49
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,610
it's actually 196 it's it's spread

50
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:29,729
across the country which is kinda nice

51
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:32,190
but as you'll see it's it's spread

52
00:02:29,729 --> 00:02:36,959
through mostly British Columbia and

53
00:02:32,189 --> 00:02:42,000
Ontario and the Albertans I think are

54
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:45,719
discovering a new sort of oil cannabis

55
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
oil right there into oil anyway so the

56
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:50,370
LPS are at various stages of approval

57
00:02:48,000 --> 00:03:01,379
some haven't yet built and some are

58
00:02:50,370 --> 00:03:03,509
actually producing in Canada the federal

59
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:06,150
government and Health Canada have played

60
00:03:03,509 --> 00:03:06,870
a very important role in trying to get

61
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:10,110
this moving

62
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:12,270
I think it speaks volumes and I'm really

63
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:14,700
quite proud of the Canadian government

64
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:17,670
and particularly Health Canada and if

65
00:03:14,699 --> 00:03:19,619
you go to their site you'll see that

66
00:03:17,669 --> 00:03:21,329
there's a load of information there

67
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:23,370
which is very useful now I want to speak

68
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:27,810
to you about that for just a few seconds

69
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:29,569
so if if you click on their site here

70
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:33,740
getting cannabis for medical purposes

71
00:03:29,569 --> 00:03:35,759
and or prescribing cannabis to patients

72
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:37,260
you see that there's a lot of

73
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:40,049
information for healthcare professionals

74
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:41,969
right I think this is a really positive

75
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:44,280
step the federal government is actually

76
00:03:41,969 --> 00:03:46,139
out there providing guidance to

77
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:49,830
physicians and other healthcare

78
00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:52,500
professionals I want to focus however on

79
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:54,959
what it says below here so I think it's

80
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:56,729
a bit of a disclaimer cannabis is not an

81
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,120
approved therapeutic product which it's

82
00:03:56,729 --> 00:04:01,919
not right it's not a therapeutic product

83
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:04,140
unless a specific cannabis product has

84
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:06,419
been issued a DIN right a drug

85
00:04:04,139 --> 00:04:08,189
information number and a notice of

86
00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:10,469
compliance then it's it's it's not a

87
00:04:08,189 --> 00:04:11,879
therapeutic product the provision of

88
00:04:10,469 --> 00:04:13,859
this information should not be

89
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:15,870
interpreted as endorsement of the use of

90
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:17,569
this product or cannabis and

91
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:20,030
cannabinoids generally by

92
00:04:17,569 --> 00:04:21,680
Canada so the it's a bit of a disclaimer

93
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:23,779
but the reality is they're really there

94
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:27,920
to support physicians health care

95
00:04:23,779 --> 00:04:30,369
workers and patients alike so if you dig

96
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:33,500
a little further and you you go to

97
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:35,959
information a summary of the essential

98
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:38,240
information about the use you'll see a

99
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:40,759
lot of information but what I'm very

100
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,240
interested in is this list here so

101
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:47,240
Health Canada actually has a list of

102
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:49,699
possible therapeutic areas for the use

103
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:51,470
of medical cannabis and I want to focus

104
00:04:49,699 --> 00:04:54,409
a couple of on a couple of things so

105
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:58,040
number one palliative care and quality

106
00:04:54,410 --> 00:05:00,260
of life as you heard earlier I went

107
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:02,990
through a number of phases in my life

108
00:05:00,259 --> 00:05:05,659
going from emergency medicine all the

109
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:07,730
way to geriatric medicine and really I

110
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:10,700
spent a lot of my time now looking after

111
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:14,300
people trying to make sure that their

112
00:05:10,699 --> 00:05:16,550
last days are comfortable and that I can

113
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:19,730
provide to them the most quality of care

114
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:21,829
as possible and that's where I find I'm

115
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:25,270
having the most success with with

116
00:05:21,829 --> 00:05:27,800
medical cannabis so so it really

117
00:05:25,269 --> 00:05:30,109
delights me to see this is at the top of

118
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:32,420
the list of course we've heard about

119
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:33,830
epilepsy I've I will tell you a little

120
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:37,040
bit about some experience I've had with

121
00:05:33,829 --> 00:05:40,129
multiple sclerosis pain I'm interested

122
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:42,550
in particularly chronic pain and then

123
00:05:40,129 --> 00:05:46,699
the psychiatric disorders particularly

124
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:48,230
anxiety sleep and and Alzheimer's is

125
00:05:46,699 --> 00:05:50,240
what I'm going to be talking to you

126
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:51,319
about the most I wish I could talk to

127
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,060
you about everything here but

128
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:55,370
unfortunately I don't quite have all

129
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:56,839
that experience yet I do also want to

130
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:59,509
point out that no list would be complete

131
00:05:56,839 --> 00:06:02,149
at least not from Health Canada if it

132
00:05:59,509 --> 00:06:03,500
didn't have a few warnings and if it

133
00:06:02,149 --> 00:06:09,589
taught didn't talk a little bit about

134
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:12,350
adverse effects so in Canada not

135
00:06:09,589 --> 00:06:15,379
everybody is on board if you go to the

136
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:17,900
site of the Royal College which is the

137
00:06:15,379 --> 00:06:19,490
site for the specialists you'll find

138
00:06:17,899 --> 00:06:22,370
that if you click on cannabis for

139
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:24,410
medical use click it actually gets you

140
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:26,030
right back to Health Canada so so

141
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:27,830
they're not they're just saying mom

142
00:06:26,029 --> 00:06:29,418
they're not saying anything about it the

143
00:06:27,829 --> 00:06:31,189
College of Physicians

144
00:06:29,418 --> 00:06:33,859
the Canadian College of Family

145
00:06:31,189 --> 00:06:37,550
Physicians rather has stepped out

146
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:41,710
they've they've published guidelines a

147
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:45,410
year or two ago and and unfortunately

148
00:06:41,709 --> 00:06:48,079
their view is very cautious shall we say

149
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:50,419
in fact they say the evidence indicates

150
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:53,439
the most consistent effects of medical

151
00:06:50,418 --> 00:06:55,698
cannabinoids are adverse events a

152
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:57,620
variety of adverse events have a greater

153
00:06:55,699 --> 00:06:59,750
magnitude of effect than the potential

154
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:01,430
benefits for the conditions targeted

155
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:03,860
which is very interesting the

156
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:06,228
conclusions drawn by this analysis are

157
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:07,580
not surprising study after study which

158
00:07:06,228 --> 00:07:09,288
is not true because there isn't study

159
00:07:07,579 --> 00:07:12,050
after studies I'll show you right

160
00:07:09,288 --> 00:07:13,879
analysis after analysis and review after

161
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:15,530
review have all reported the same

162
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:18,949
findings cannabis has little place

163
00:07:15,529 --> 00:07:22,489
within current therapeutic Arsenal's I

164
00:07:18,949 --> 00:07:24,889
beg to differ I don't I don't agree with

165
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:28,490
that unfortunately and this is really

166
00:07:24,889 --> 00:07:31,038
one of my key messages is we need the

167
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:36,228
research right we really need good

168
00:07:31,038 --> 00:07:37,639
clinical research so moving south of the

169
00:07:36,228 --> 00:07:40,240
border to the National Academies of

170
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:43,280
Sciences and engineering and medicine

171
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:46,009
it's it's quite the same cautionary tale

172
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:48,288
right so they say here despite increased

173
00:07:46,009 --> 00:07:50,810
cannabis use and changing state level

174
00:07:48,288 --> 00:07:52,968
policy landscape conclusive evidence

175
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:54,860
regarding the short and long term health

176
00:07:52,968 --> 00:07:59,750
effects both harms and benefits of

177
00:07:54,860 --> 00:08:01,819
cannabis use remains elusive I think for

178
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:04,310
those people who like myself are

179
00:08:01,819 --> 00:08:06,110
currently using it prescribing it to

180
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:09,530
patients there's very little doubt of

181
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:11,840
the efficacy unfortunately it's just not

182
00:08:09,529 --> 00:08:14,568
proven the way that we would like to see

183
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:19,689
it proven for products that are

184
00:08:14,569 --> 00:08:21,560
currently marketed right alright so

185
00:08:19,689 --> 00:08:24,740
there was this guy

186
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:28,728
Plato right and he said the mind is a

187
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:33,769
chariot steered by reason but pulled by

188
00:08:28,728 --> 00:08:36,199
passions and in keeping with the

189
00:08:33,769 --> 00:08:39,139
Hippocratic oath I strongly believe that

190
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:40,680
I have to provide my patients with those

191
00:08:39,139 --> 00:08:42,778
things that are

192
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:46,049
to them that will help them in their

193
00:08:42,778 --> 00:08:49,259
suffering and so it is that a more

194
00:08:46,049 --> 00:08:51,449
modern physician said prescribing

195
00:08:49,259 --> 00:08:54,929
medical cannabis should be steered by

196
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:58,740
clinical science and pulled by patients

197
00:08:54,929 --> 00:09:00,389
needs unfortunately or fortunately

198
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:02,759
rather than the patient's needs are

199
00:09:00,389 --> 00:09:05,460
there but I think the science is still

200
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:07,019
lacking and I'm hoping that after today

201
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:09,089
you'll all be convinced that we need to

202
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:12,838
go out there we need to push the

203
00:09:09,089 --> 00:09:15,120
institutions private-public to get out

204
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:18,029
there and give us more research and and

205
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:22,350
really to fund the research that needs

206
00:09:18,028 --> 00:09:24,269
to be done okay so in the elderly what

207
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:25,860
have I been doing well I've been looking

208
00:09:24,269 --> 00:09:27,569
after patients and I'll tell you a

209
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:30,050
little bit about about dementia in a

210
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:32,850
minute but I've been looking after

211
00:09:30,049 --> 00:09:35,729
elderly patients who suffer from

212
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:37,800
insomnia agitation in dementia which

213
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:43,050
I'll talk to you a bit more anxiety pain

214
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:44,519
and parkington's disease so show me the

215
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:47,909
evidence let's talk about what I was

216
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:49,708
able to find out there first of all I

217
00:09:47,909 --> 00:09:51,329
think it's important to understand what

218
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:54,689
the constraints are on doing clinical

219
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:57,480
research right so need i say more about

220
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:59,040
that first heading there's limited

221
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,778
funding it's not because the money is

222
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:03,599
not out there it is out there it's just

223
00:10:00,778 --> 00:10:06,299
who wishes to use that money for

224
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:09,209
clinical research very poor

225
00:10:06,299 --> 00:10:10,949
standardization of product and and I'll

226
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:11,659
show you of what I mean by that in just

227
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:14,339
a minute

228
00:10:11,659 --> 00:10:16,169
questionable compliance of subjects it's

229
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:20,970
very hard to do a clinical trial in

230
00:10:16,169 --> 00:10:22,439
somebody with with cannabis if on you

231
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:25,759
know at home they're also also smoking

232
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:28,020
it so so compliance is a huge issue

233
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:29,850
there's a lot of confounders that are

234
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:32,250
difficult to to control of course

235
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:34,680
there's not just age and gender but

236
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:36,870
there's comorbidities there's other

237
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:39,239
medications there's activities and so on

238
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:41,940
and so forth so good research takes into

239
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:44,310
account the confounders that we need to

240
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:45,210
look after searching for an indication

241
00:10:44,309 --> 00:10:48,269
here

242
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:50,460
I mean III think that you saw that list

243
00:10:48,269 --> 00:10:52,379
from Health Canada there's an awful lot

244
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:54,060
of possibility but I think we're gonna

245
00:10:52,379 --> 00:10:56,039
have to be really systematic here I

246
00:10:54,059 --> 00:10:58,559
think we shouldn't be funding everything

247
00:10:56,039 --> 00:11:00,389
I think we need to drill down try to see

248
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:03,799
what we think as a society are the

249
00:11:00,389 --> 00:11:06,210
greatest needs prioritize and move down

250
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:07,919
the other thing is in searching for an

251
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:10,620
indication when you do clinical research

252
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:11,099
you have to say what is my outcome

253
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:14,879
measure

254
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:16,769
what difference am I trying to show it's

255
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:18,720
not enough to say that people felt

256
00:11:16,769 --> 00:11:20,519
better and I think that's to a certain

257
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:24,480
extent been the problem so far

258
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:26,220
a choice of control arm are we going to

259
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,980
do the research compared to another fire

260
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:31,560
to a pharmaceutical or is it to a

261
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:34,950
placebo etc etc at the standard of care

262
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:37,349
and as I said just a minute ago we

263
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:40,590
really do need validated outcome tools

264
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:47,940
what are we studying what outcomes do we

265
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:49,710
want to look at okay so let me talk a

266
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:52,710
little bit about Parkinson's disease

267
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:58,170
Parkinson's disease is very interesting

268
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:59,790
because the the cb1 receptors are very

269
00:11:58,169 --> 00:12:02,009
dense in the basal ganglia which is

270
00:11:59,789 --> 00:12:04,860
where the substantia nigra is which is

271
00:12:02,009 --> 00:12:06,720
where the disease of Parkinson's is I

272
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:09,930
think it's very interesting to see that

273
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:13,440
all those receptors are there and there

274
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:15,779
is some suggestion that the cb1 agonist

275
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:18,030
attenuate that levodopa induced

276
00:12:15,779 --> 00:12:19,500
dyskinesia so levodopa is a medication

277
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:21,299
that's given to patients with

278
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:25,289
parkinson's disease to relieve their

279
00:12:21,299 --> 00:12:26,849
symptoms it is not a cure and and to

280
00:12:25,289 --> 00:12:29,459
date I've only been able to find one

281
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:32,670
study from 2004 that actually looked at

282
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:34,680
that and their study was frankly not

283
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:36,689
conclusive so I think I think more work

284
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:37,829
needs to be done in that area of course

285
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:40,740
the patients that I've been treating

286
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:45,360
with Parkinson's all have all are all

287
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:46,820
taking levodopa we have seen some

288
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,830
studies and I'll show you some of those

289
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:51,330
that that shown efficacy in Parkinson's

290
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:53,570
disease in treating some of the symptoms

291
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:55,670
of tremor rigidity and

292
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:58,900
Radek Indonesia which is that that slow

293
00:12:55,669 --> 00:13:01,069
movement that they have and there's some

294
00:12:58,899 --> 00:13:03,679
question as to whether or not cannabis

295
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:09,050
might not have neuroprotective effects

296
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:12,259
via an antioxidant effect so clinical

297
00:13:09,049 --> 00:13:14,449
trials and again very difficult to

298
00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:16,909
really pinpoint where they are if

299
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:19,280
they're out there they're not in the

300
00:13:16,909 --> 00:13:20,929
traditional literature I know that

301
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:22,759
Israel for instance has a lot of

302
00:13:20,929 --> 00:13:24,079
programs ongoing but trying to get your

303
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:27,590
hands on some of that literature is very

304
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:28,700
difficult there was a study that

305
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:31,519
appeared in the Journal of

306
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:34,009
psychopharmacology by show gas in 2014

307
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,809
they looked at 21 patients they compared

308
00:13:34,009 --> 00:13:39,799
I think they had two patients on placebo

309
00:13:35,809 --> 00:13:41,689
versus 75 milligrams of CBD and or 300

310
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:46,250
milligrams the patients were treated for

311
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:49,910
six weeks they found no effect on on the

312
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:53,419
symptoms of Parkinson's but on quality

313
00:13:49,909 --> 00:13:56,329
of life questionnaires they found quite

314
00:13:53,419 --> 00:13:58,009
a quite a significant difference so okay

315
00:13:56,330 --> 00:14:00,470
you weren't able to treat the symptoms

316
00:13:58,009 --> 00:14:02,240
but you did improve the quality of life

317
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:03,590
which which is important right I think

318
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:08,690
that's an important finding yeah go

319
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:12,879
ahead no sorry it's a good point good

320
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:12,880
question actually was just a 300 yeah

321
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:19,940
and then lo 10 and again in 2014 in the

322
00:14:17,659 --> 00:14:23,089
clinical neuropharmacology they looked

323
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:26,210
at 22 patients it was smoked cannabis

324
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:29,030
that that was the the trial and at 30

325
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:30,710
minutes later they saw improved rigidity

326
00:14:29,029 --> 00:14:33,649
tremor and Bretta kinesia

327
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:35,860
which lasted for up to three hours yes

328
00:14:33,649 --> 00:14:35,860
please

329
00:14:39,168 --> 00:14:44,778
yesterday they were yeah

330
00:14:41,778 --> 00:14:44,778
so-so

331
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:56,828
oh absolutely yeah yeah I mean I mean so

332
00:14:54,249 --> 00:14:58,989
so it's that's a very good example of

333
00:14:56,828 --> 00:15:01,958
what I mean by looking at outcomes right

334
00:14:58,989 --> 00:15:03,999
if we're actually not able to cure

335
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:05,768
something but if we're able to decrease

336
00:15:03,999 --> 00:15:08,379
the amount of medications that people

337
00:15:05,769 --> 00:15:10,659
are taking particularly in Parkinson's

338
00:15:08,379 --> 00:15:12,129
where tolerance to the medication

339
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:13,928
currently out there builds and

340
00:15:12,129 --> 00:15:15,850
ultimately becomes less and less

341
00:15:13,928 --> 00:15:19,749
effective it'd be really nice to be able

342
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:21,119
to reduce how much they take Oh big-time

343
00:15:19,749 --> 00:15:24,329
big-time

344
00:15:21,119 --> 00:15:26,829
big big time yeah you're totally right

345
00:15:24,328 --> 00:15:28,208
so so you can see right here that

346
00:15:26,828 --> 00:15:29,798
there's a bit of a problem right and

347
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:31,448
we're talking about research here so

348
00:15:29,798 --> 00:15:33,578
here we're talking about giving CBD

349
00:15:31,448 --> 00:15:35,889
we're talking about placebo here we're

350
00:15:33,578 --> 00:15:37,958
talking about cannabis smoked we're

351
00:15:35,889 --> 00:15:39,850
looking at 30 minutes rather than six

352
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:41,678
weeks out and so I think that's one of

353
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:42,970
the problems right now with with some of

354
00:15:41,678 --> 00:15:44,919
the researchers I think we're gonna have

355
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:51,220
to get it down and see where we want to

356
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:54,669
go with with with this I answer that I

357
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:56,829
don't remember oh yes sure so he's

358
00:15:54,669 --> 00:15:59,019
asking if it was what what what the

359
00:15:56,828 --> 00:16:00,909
cannabis was was it flower or whatever

360
00:15:59,019 --> 00:16:02,649
and I don't think it was detailed in

361
00:16:00,909 --> 00:16:04,808
there unfortunately and again I think

362
00:16:02,649 --> 00:16:06,339
that that speaks to the issue that I

363
00:16:04,808 --> 00:16:12,789
have with the research it's just not

364
00:16:06,339 --> 00:16:15,910
consistent right okay so be PSD who's

365
00:16:12,789 --> 00:16:18,068
familiar with bee PSD okay so so I

366
00:16:15,909 --> 00:16:20,019
always forget what be PSD stands for

367
00:16:18,068 --> 00:16:21,368
because I I use the term be PSD so much

368
00:16:20,019 --> 00:16:23,369
that I you know it's one of those things

369
00:16:21,369 --> 00:16:27,160
to just use the acronym so it's it's

370
00:16:23,369 --> 00:16:29,709
behavioral psychological symptoms of

371
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:33,399
dementia and in the patient population

372
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:36,638
that I'm treating this is a huge issue

373
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:39,490
we are currently giving what I consider

374
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:41,499
to be highly toxic drugs so everybody

375
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:43,418
here has heard about antipsychotics

376
00:16:41,499 --> 00:16:46,418
right and the fact that we're giving

377
00:16:43,418 --> 00:16:49,239
either antipsychotics or benzodiazepines

378
00:16:46,418 --> 00:16:51,639
or other drugs that that change the

379
00:16:49,239 --> 00:16:54,610
behavior of patients suffering from

380
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:56,470
dementia these are toxic substances and

381
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:57,999
I think if nothing else if we can find

382
00:16:56,470 --> 00:17:00,309
something that we can give to them that

383
00:16:57,999 --> 00:17:01,990
decreases some of the symptoms and that

384
00:17:00,308 --> 00:17:06,420
is less toxic

385
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:06,420
why not right okay

386
00:17:12,009 --> 00:17:16,599
well we can get into that you you you

387
00:17:15,099 --> 00:17:19,389
can but it's preferable not to but

388
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:21,219
sometimes really yeah if they're having

389
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:23,919
hallucinations and so on sooner or later

390
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:24,939
you do have to and certainly when you're

391
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:28,360
getting cannabis you don't want to

392
00:17:24,939 --> 00:17:30,308
increase the hallucinations so in a

393
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:32,649
study in 2016 in the Journal of

394
00:17:30,308 --> 00:17:34,779
Alzheimer's disease there was an open

395
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:37,259
label add-on which means that whatever

396
00:17:34,779 --> 00:17:40,000
they were on we added the cannabis right

397
00:17:37,259 --> 00:17:45,879
there were 11 patients with dementia and

398
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:47,910
they receive daily cannabis oil and the

399
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:50,500
findings were interesting but of course

400
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:51,279
when you're talking about just 11

401
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:53,500
patients

402
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:55,359
there's just no power so this is really

403
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:57,940
more or less an observational study

404
00:17:55,359 --> 00:18:02,439
which is very much like what I'm going

405
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:06,039
to show you that I've been doing and

406
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:08,289
then in another study in 2017 of course

407
00:18:06,039 --> 00:18:11,109
this is using products that are already

408
00:18:08,289 --> 00:18:14,259
marketed again the studies are very

409
00:18:11,109 --> 00:18:15,548
small but it does seems like THC was

410
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:19,240
able to decrease the severity of

411
00:18:15,548 --> 00:18:21,129
disturbed behavior and I found this one

412
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:24,460
interesting because this is a big issue

413
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:26,740
right sundowning so later in the day the

414
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:28,240
symptoms become far worse and it would

415
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:32,259
appear that that there may be some

416
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:39,849
effect in nighttime agitation huge study

417
00:18:32,259 --> 00:18:42,849
to patients okay and what about sleep so

418
00:18:39,849 --> 00:18:46,389
sleep and anxiety or what - I think my

419
00:18:42,849 --> 00:18:49,178
favorite indications for using this so

420
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:51,009
sleep disturbances as you know are very

421
00:18:49,179 --> 00:18:53,048
common it's not just in the elderly

422
00:18:51,009 --> 00:18:55,058
though as we grow older it does become

423
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:57,069
more of a problem but up to 70 million

424
00:18:55,058 --> 00:18:59,798
Americans are actually affected with

425
00:18:57,069 --> 00:19:01,450
with sleep disturbances of all sorts

426
00:18:59,798 --> 00:19:03,519
right I think for the physicians in the

427
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:05,200
room you know if you send a patient for

428
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:10,058
sleep study they're going to end up with

429
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:11,410
a mask I mean so so I think I think it'd

430
00:19:10,058 --> 00:19:13,000
be much nicer to give him something

431
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:17,440
that's a little less invasive than those

432
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:19,779
mask forces with CPAP so 35% prevalence

433
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,890
of insomnia in the elderly far worse of

434
00:19:19,779 --> 00:19:22,899
course in patients suffering from

435
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:25,180
dementia and

436
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:27,970
again in a review by the National

437
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:30,600
Academies of Sciences there appears to

438
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:33,299
be moderate evidence of effect of

439
00:19:30,599 --> 00:19:36,219
medical cannabis on sleep disturbance

440
00:19:33,299 --> 00:19:39,220
but here's the evidence Dern a banal

441
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:40,930
versus ME trip to lean of course

442
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:42,039
amitriptyline should not even be used in

443
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:44,740
the elderly in this patient population

444
00:19:42,039 --> 00:19:47,649
and they had a moderate effect there and

445
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:50,349
I can NAB alone in fibromyalgia it

446
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:53,230
looked at the quality of sleep there

447
00:19:50,349 --> 00:19:54,879
there's just no Studies on primary

448
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:57,819
insomnia there are no studies in

449
00:19:54,880 --> 00:20:01,660
patients with dementia who have a huge

450
00:19:57,819 --> 00:20:06,009
issue with with sleep how am i doing on

451
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:08,519
time I'm not seeing a oh there you how

452
00:20:06,009 --> 00:20:08,519
much time left

453
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:19,140
all right 18 minutes that's great yeah

454
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:21,370
I'll make a fact so finally in anxiety

455
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:24,400
there was one study that was done with

456
00:20:21,369 --> 00:20:26,529
600 milligrams versus placebo 24

457
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:29,830
patients now here's the outcome measure

458
00:20:26,529 --> 00:20:33,490
right they looked at the effect of this

459
00:20:29,829 --> 00:20:36,129
on anxiety prior to public speaking so

460
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:38,680
how applicable is it to social anxiety

461
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:43,660
disorder or other anxiety disorders

462
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:45,820
again very difficult to say and yet when

463
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:47,740
we talk about anxiety if you look on the

464
00:20:45,819 --> 00:20:50,169
web you're gonna find a whole lot of

465
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:53,230
sites that preach to how good their

466
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:55,720
product is for anxiety and unfortunately

467
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:57,610
the evidence just isn't there yet though

468
00:20:55,720 --> 00:21:00,009
I think we all have a you know a good

469
00:20:57,609 --> 00:21:05,289
feeling that that it it would work and

470
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:09,309
finally in pain mark we're from from

471
00:21:05,289 --> 00:21:11,710
McGill did a study in 2015 they were

472
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:14,529
actually looking at the side effects of

473
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:17,769
of providing medical cannabis they had

474
00:21:14,529 --> 00:21:21,210
216 control patients 215 patients that

475
00:21:17,769 --> 00:21:25,599
received cannabis with 12.5 percent THC

476
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:26,920
up to 5 grams per day so again it's a

477
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:28,480
little bit all over the map right people

478
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,140
were getting at they could use a little

479
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,730
bit more

480
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:32,430
but less it's difficult really to

481
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:35,860
quantitate how much they were getting

482
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:37,210
but here's what they found they they and

483
00:21:35,859 --> 00:21:39,429
I'll show you about the pain but what

484
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:42,610
they did find is increased functionality

485
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:44,980
and improve mood so when you're thinking

486
00:21:42,609 --> 00:21:47,229
about quality of life increasing

487
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:50,170
functionality and mood and check-check

488
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:51,970
that's pretty important and then if you

489
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:54,970
looked at at pain now they said that

490
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:56,470
they had an effect yeah okay well we'll

491
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:59,860
go with that but as you can see if you

492
00:21:56,470 --> 00:22:02,289
look at the average pain intensity it's

493
00:21:59,859 --> 00:22:04,750
sort of evens out so I I don't see and I

494
00:22:02,289 --> 00:22:06,460
think really the problem here is that we

495
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:10,059
would need to do trials with far more

496
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:12,549
patients and we can't just be looking at

497
00:22:10,059 --> 00:22:14,289
pain in general I think we need to

498
00:22:12,549 --> 00:22:16,210
really hone it down what kind of pain

499
00:22:14,289 --> 00:22:18,609
are we looking at chronic acute back

500
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:21,789
pain knee pain headache whatever so we

501
00:22:18,609 --> 00:22:24,519
really need to hone it down and then

502
00:22:21,789 --> 00:22:26,740
finally if you look at this study that

503
00:22:24,519 --> 00:22:28,269
was just published very recently they

504
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:30,670
had a lot of patients this was a

505
00:22:28,269 --> 00:22:33,730
registry they followed them for six

506
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:37,269
months and they looked at pain intensity

507
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:40,299
it decreased but here's the thing 18%

508
00:22:37,269 --> 00:22:45,099
were able to stop opioids an opioid

509
00:22:40,299 --> 00:22:48,430
analgesic that to me is phenomenal that

510
00:22:45,099 --> 00:22:50,500
I like to see and of course increase the

511
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:51,549
quality of life there were some side

512
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:56,589
effects I don't think that there's

513
00:22:51,549 --> 00:22:58,299
anything surprising there okay so why

514
00:22:56,589 --> 00:23:00,699
nursing home patients I'm going to be

515
00:22:58,299 --> 00:23:04,230
brief on this essentially now we have

516
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:06,519
policies allows us to move forward why

517
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:08,650
because they take a lot of toxic

518
00:23:06,519 --> 00:23:11,109
medicines that I told you about and

519
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:12,850
believe it or not extremely receptive

520
00:23:11,109 --> 00:23:14,829
when I started talking to elderly

521
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:17,379
patients or their families about using

522
00:23:14,829 --> 00:23:18,819
this it was yeah let's do it and when I

523
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:19,870
was able to tell them that no they're

524
00:23:18,819 --> 00:23:22,389
not gonna have to go outside and smoke

525
00:23:19,869 --> 00:23:25,959
it that we have oil they were very very

526
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:28,600
keen and and I'm skipping ahead here but

527
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:30,789
the uptake for me so we started with one

528
00:23:28,599 --> 00:23:33,039
and two and three and now it's weekly

529
00:23:30,789 --> 00:23:35,559
twice weekly and in the nursing homes

530
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:36,309
that I'm in and I look after close to

531
00:23:35,559 --> 00:23:38,980
200 people

532
00:23:36,309 --> 00:23:40,599
it's almost daily now that I'm getting a

533
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:42,450
request for medical cannabis and a lot

534
00:23:40,599 --> 00:23:45,849
of it is just word of mouth

535
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:47,710
so it is a controlled environment and it

536
00:23:45,849 --> 00:23:49,539
is a monitored environment so it's a

537
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:50,980
nice place to actually do this because I

538
00:23:49,539 --> 00:23:53,349
know that everything else is controlled

539
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:55,480
and and that if I'm seeing an effect

540
00:23:53,349 --> 00:24:00,659
it's probably not because of some of the

541
00:23:55,480 --> 00:24:05,679
confounders okay cannabis oil

542
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:07,720
oops sorry the prana talked about the

543
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:11,440
cons a little bit with some slides later

544
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:13,150
on it is expensive but Moy my god it's

545
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,529
difficult for the patients to get it

546
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:17,230
really is and I'm going to show you that

547
00:24:14,529 --> 00:24:19,329
in just a minute and what's more it's

548
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:21,640
impossible for me to prescribe what the

549
00:24:19,329 --> 00:24:23,139
licensed producers are making we're

550
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:26,259
completely disconnected and I'll show

551
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:27,640
you that in just a minute alright what

552
00:24:26,259 --> 00:24:29,859
are my objectives

553
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:32,830
I just want to relieve pain anxiety

554
00:24:29,859 --> 00:24:34,389
insomnia loss of appetite depression I

555
00:24:32,829 --> 00:24:36,460
want to give them back their

556
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:38,259
functionality and potentially a little

557
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:41,470
bit of independence with their

558
00:24:38,259 --> 00:24:43,779
activities of daily living and if we can

559
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:45,730
relieve some of the bps D that would be

560
00:24:43,779 --> 00:24:50,319
fantastic because it means less toxic

561
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:53,308
drugs and part of the way of my

562
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:57,970
reasoning is is if I can take care of

563
00:24:53,308 --> 00:25:02,039
these illnesses these mental health

564
00:24:57,970 --> 00:25:05,440
issues am I going to impact the the

565
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:06,849
agitation that these people suffer one

566
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:09,220
of the things about patients with DeMint

567
00:25:06,849 --> 00:25:11,619
is they can't tell you my knee hurts but

568
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:14,169
they can act out if you're able to treat

569
00:25:11,619 --> 00:25:16,298
their insomnia or their anxiety which

570
00:25:14,169 --> 00:25:18,429
they suffer a lot from it may mean that

571
00:25:16,298 --> 00:25:19,779
in the end you're actually treating some

572
00:25:18,429 --> 00:25:24,669
of the agitation and some of the

573
00:25:19,779 --> 00:25:25,990
symptoms of dementia that they have I'm

574
00:25:24,669 --> 00:25:27,580
just going to skip through that it's

575
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:30,190
just to say that it's a very very

576
00:25:27,579 --> 00:25:31,808
controlled environment we have to keep

577
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:33,730
in mind that endocannabinoids have a

578
00:25:31,808 --> 00:25:35,950
huge role to play in in the

579
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:38,500
cardiovascular system and that elderly

580
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:42,340
patients might be prone to some of the

581
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:45,429
side effects in particular you can get

582
00:25:42,339 --> 00:25:47,859
hypotension and some dysrhythmia so I am

583
00:25:45,429 --> 00:25:51,298
on the lookout for that to date I'm

584
00:25:47,859 --> 00:25:51,298
pleased to say that I've had no issues

585
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:56,559
okay so as I said this is relatively new

586
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,950
in nursing home so my numbers are not

587
00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:01,809
great but I do want to very quickly tell

588
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:03,039
you about some of the research and some

589
00:26:01,809 --> 00:26:05,200
of the results that I've been having I

590
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:07,930
say research in fact it's all

591
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:10,210
observational right so I've been looking

592
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:13,269
after patients with anxiety insomnia and

593
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:15,490
agitation my numbers are small this is

594
00:26:13,269 --> 00:26:19,930
the dosage range that I've been giving

595
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:22,839
of of the oil and the success rate has

596
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:24,970
been just tremendous just tremendous I'm

597
00:26:22,839 --> 00:26:26,740
so pleased at how this has has been

598
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:29,160
working on let's leave the questions for

599
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:29,160
after okay

600
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:40,710
okay can you change it because this is

601
00:26:36,778 --> 00:26:42,269
alright I've also used it in pain I will

602
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:44,730
say that one patient with spinal

603
00:26:42,269 --> 00:26:47,298
stenosis decided not to take the CBD oil

604
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:50,190
but decided to vape and she had a

605
00:26:47,298 --> 00:26:52,200
paradoxical increase in in pain it was

606
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:53,609
terrible and she never took it again so

607
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:56,249
I don't know really what happened there

608
00:26:53,608 --> 00:26:58,439
but I have been looking after patients

609
00:26:56,249 --> 00:27:04,019
with various pains and again getting

610
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:06,210
some relief multiple sclerosis oh my god

611
00:27:04,019 --> 00:27:10,190
I've had only two patients but they've

612
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:13,470
responded so well I do use higher THC in

613
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:17,548
Parkinson's I've been I've had three

614
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:19,739
patients really only one out of three

615
00:27:17,548 --> 00:27:22,168
had an improvement in some of the motor

616
00:27:19,739 --> 00:27:25,038
symptoms but again am I at the right

617
00:27:22,169 --> 00:27:27,570
dose that I used it for long enough etc

618
00:27:25,038 --> 00:27:31,648
TMJ incidentally one of my patients who

619
00:27:27,569 --> 00:27:32,519
had MS had their jaw and actually went

620
00:27:31,648 --> 00:27:34,439
away which I thought was very

621
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:36,450
interesting and in progressive

622
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:39,480
supranuclear policy which is another

623
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:43,080
neurological disorder I didn't have any

624
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:45,298
success there okay totally subjective no

625
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:47,668
controls some of my patients are

626
00:27:45,298 --> 00:27:50,908
cognitively impaired so a lot of the

627
00:27:47,669 --> 00:27:53,730
information is either observed or told

628
00:27:50,909 --> 00:27:55,409
to me by family or nurses and

629
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:58,829
unfortunately there's a very wide

630
00:27:55,409 --> 00:28:00,960
variety of products received and I want

631
00:27:58,829 --> 00:28:03,808
to talk to you about that because this

632
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:07,200
issue here of navigating the the web is

633
00:28:03,808 --> 00:28:09,690
extremely difficult if you go and you

634
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:11,639
look at various LPS and I've just took

635
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:13,739
them randomly you can see that there's a

636
00:28:11,638 --> 00:28:16,439
lot of products look at this trying to

637
00:28:13,739 --> 00:28:18,358
figure out what THC and CBD they're

638
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:23,999
supposed to get and the list goes on

639
00:28:18,358 --> 00:28:26,878
right so the list goes on thank you I

640
00:28:23,999 --> 00:28:30,690
think I'll just change the slides again

641
00:28:26,878 --> 00:28:33,058
here you can see THC CBD THC various

642
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:36,058
write various amounts change the slide

643
00:28:33,058 --> 00:28:38,940
again this is one company again now

644
00:28:36,058 --> 00:28:40,319
we're going up into the higher THC s but

645
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:42,200
it's very difficult for the patients to

646
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:45,089
navigate next slide please

647
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:47,100
this is candy Med so I like to prescribe

648
00:28:45,089 --> 00:28:50,819
one in 10 THC

649
00:28:47,099 --> 00:28:52,798
you CBD unfortunately I can't find it or

650
00:28:50,819 --> 00:28:55,139
my patients can't find it and then some

651
00:28:52,798 --> 00:28:56,700
of the LPS are saying well that's not

652
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:58,470
what you prescribed well okay

653
00:28:56,700 --> 00:29:00,150
what do you have that resembles that

654
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:02,940
guys like really let's get with it

655
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:04,820
I want low THC high CBD clear enough

656
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:07,230
next slide please

657
00:29:04,819 --> 00:29:10,849
again this is another manufacturer they

658
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:14,788
have two oils this one is is low THC

659
00:29:10,849 --> 00:29:16,918
high CBD or low THC much higher CBD

660
00:29:14,788 --> 00:29:18,269
again if they go to that site I'm not

661
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:20,250
allowed to tell them what site to go to

662
00:29:18,269 --> 00:29:22,740
they have to go look I do try to tell

663
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:25,529
them how to do it but next slide please

664
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:26,970
and again one more extract this one is

665
00:29:25,529 --> 00:29:30,089
with tilray and this one's completely

666
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:33,058
different they say ten of eight THC 25

667
00:29:30,089 --> 00:29:35,279
THC 10 + 10 + 25 and 25 so I can't even

668
00:29:33,058 --> 00:29:36,048
get the ratio with these guys next slide

669
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:40,048
please

670
00:29:36,048 --> 00:29:43,019
alright as I said enthusiastic

671
00:29:40,048 --> 00:29:45,779
population consistent care compliance

672
00:29:43,019 --> 00:29:47,460
and monitored that's why research in

673
00:29:45,779 --> 00:29:49,710
nursing homes with the elderly patients

674
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:52,558
is a great venue for doing good quality

675
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:55,048
research next slide please

676
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:57,149
and I want to say one other thing about

677
00:29:55,048 --> 00:30:00,029
something completely different

678
00:29:57,150 --> 00:30:03,659
I do addiction medicine I have about 300

679
00:30:00,029 --> 00:30:09,269
or so patients that are addicted to

680
00:30:03,659 --> 00:30:12,630
opioids 90% of them smoke pot 80% have

681
00:30:09,269 --> 00:30:15,629
concomitant mental health disorders it's

682
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:19,110
a huge issue they smoke because it

683
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:22,440
relieves some of their symptoms why

684
00:30:19,109 --> 00:30:25,408
can't we actually provide them with good

685
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:27,808
quality oils that may actually decrease

686
00:30:25,409 --> 00:30:29,549
the amount of methadone that I have to

687
00:30:27,808 --> 00:30:33,440
give them let's face it methadone is not

688
00:30:29,548 --> 00:30:38,129
a walk in the park it's a toxic drug so

689
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:39,690
to finish then oh one more thing let's

690
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:42,510
not go down the Avenue of taking

691
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:44,100
particular cannabinoids and saying oh

692
00:30:42,509 --> 00:30:45,720
this one's good for this this one's good

693
00:30:44,099 --> 00:30:47,548
for that use but this one or that one

694
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:51,150
there's just no evidence let's just

695
00:30:47,548 --> 00:30:52,509
stick with the oils for right now so my

696
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:55,269
conclusions

697
00:30:52,509 --> 00:30:57,609
there is increasing demand for medicinal

698
00:30:55,269 --> 00:30:59,859
cannabis use in long-term care my

699
00:30:57,609 --> 00:31:03,308
patients are keen on it they want it and

700
00:30:59,859 --> 00:31:05,319
we need to do the research what I showed

701
00:31:03,308 --> 00:31:07,720
you is not research it's observational

702
00:31:05,319 --> 00:31:09,730
only but I think there signals there and

703
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:12,490
I think it behooves us to go down that

704
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:15,579
path further we do need to have

705
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:17,440
validated tools we knew do need to have

706
00:31:15,579 --> 00:31:19,869
standard I'd center dite dose

707
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:21,130
standardized doses right I can't be

708
00:31:19,869 --> 00:31:23,649
prescribing one in 10 and they're

709
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:27,610
getting 25 or whatever is out there and

710
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:29,080
finally if I didn't say so already the

711
00:31:27,609 --> 00:31:31,240
nursing home environment and the

712
00:31:29,079 --> 00:31:33,849
patients they're in are a wonderful

713
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:36,880
environment for doing well controlled

714
00:31:33,849 --> 00:31:46,089
well-designed clinical research and on

715
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:49,150
that note I think I will end I will be

716
00:31:46,089 --> 00:31:51,129
around most of the day but if my email

717
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:53,048
is there and if you have questions you

718
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:55,320
whatever ideas whatever you want to

719
00:31:53,048 --> 00:31:58,440
share and I'm happy to hear from you

720
00:31:55,319 --> 00:31:58,439
yeah we

721
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:10,038
I write either I dazzle do with my

722
00:32:08,179 --> 00:32:17,090
brilliance or I bath will do with my

723
00:32:10,038 --> 00:32:19,038
bullshit you said 1 to 10 10 to 1 CBD

724
00:32:17,089 --> 00:32:23,928
THC is what you would like to prescribe

725
00:32:19,038 --> 00:32:26,538
I yes I I like to you know I really I'm

726
00:32:23,929 --> 00:32:28,400
a novice right and so so I started down

727
00:32:26,538 --> 00:32:31,879
the path of 1 and 10 which seemed to be

728
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:34,940
what was available and and I can't find

729
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:37,370
it so so now I'm having to actually go

730
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:40,308
back and change so that I can prescribe

731
00:32:37,369 --> 00:32:43,308
what it is that the licensed producer is

732
00:32:40,308 --> 00:32:45,230
able to supply to my patient it's see

733
00:32:43,308 --> 00:32:47,418
that the way it works is in Canada I

734
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:51,620
have to you use the Health Canada like

735
00:32:47,419 --> 00:32:54,500
form they have to take that form go to

736
00:32:51,619 --> 00:32:58,250
the web find the licensed producer that

737
00:32:54,500 --> 00:33:01,640
suits them best and then send in that

738
00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:04,099
prescription and then get the feedback

739
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:06,409
so the other day actually one one and

740
00:33:04,099 --> 00:33:09,408
I'll say their name Green relief they

741
00:33:06,409 --> 00:33:12,409
actually wrote they R actually called me

742
00:33:09,409 --> 00:33:14,240
and we had a great discussion and it was

743
00:33:12,409 --> 00:33:16,520
really nice to talk with them and they

744
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:18,109
made some really smart suggestions and I

745
00:33:16,519 --> 00:33:24,139
was able to get the prescription right

746
00:33:18,109 --> 00:33:26,449
so kudos to Green movie that up there

747
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:28,370
it didn't identify what the ratio of the

748
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:31,159
cannabis was it records mentioned the

749
00:33:28,369 --> 00:33:33,500
dosage it would we assume it was the 1

750
00:33:31,159 --> 00:33:35,360
to 10 on those or no it's the wrong

751
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:37,940
stuff it's a very wrong assumption okay

752
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:40,069
you know it's a little more way more

753
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:42,110
randomized each producer has something

754
00:33:40,069 --> 00:33:43,908
completely different which is a problem

755
00:33:42,109 --> 00:33:45,558
right and and if I want to do some good

756
00:33:43,909 --> 00:33:47,270
clinical work it's difficult for me

757
00:33:45,558 --> 00:33:48,918
because I don't really know honestly

758
00:33:47,269 --> 00:33:50,779
what I'm prescribing I know it's gonna

759
00:33:48,919 --> 00:33:54,679
be low THC I know it's gonna be high CBD

760
00:33:50,779 --> 00:33:57,680
ish but in the end from one patient to

761
00:33:54,679 --> 00:33:59,710
another I don't know

762
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,710
Oh

763
00:34:01,609 --> 00:34:05,240
how could you get these studies that

764
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:07,610
you're doing and I know they're

765
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:09,710
observational is what would be the

766
00:34:07,609 --> 00:34:13,309
easiest way for you to maybe work with

767
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:15,648
some type of organization to get these

768
00:34:13,309 --> 00:34:17,809
actually looked at more seriously and

769
00:34:15,648 --> 00:34:20,029
maybe change a couple of things is that

770
00:34:17,809 --> 00:34:21,289
a possibility so I don't know you but I

771
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:22,909
could just hug you for that question

772
00:34:21,289 --> 00:34:25,539
right now

773
00:34:22,909 --> 00:34:28,760
because actually it's something I want

774
00:34:25,539 --> 00:34:30,679
yes so you didn't hear the question what

775
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:33,440
would it take ultimately to get the

776
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:35,030
research done so if I went to a

777
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,950
particular LP and I said look can you

778
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:38,330
fund my research they kind of say well

779
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:40,250
what's in it with me because ultimately

780
00:34:38,329 --> 00:34:42,110
they'd be growing the market without

781
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:42,668
necessarily growing their piece of the

782
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:47,300
pie

783
00:34:42,668 --> 00:34:50,359
however if all the LPS got together and

784
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:53,360
said together we're going to set up a

785
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:55,070
real in achill Research Fund and we're

786
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:57,950
going to take a certain percentage of

787
00:34:55,070 --> 00:35:00,440
our profits of our revenues and put it

788
00:34:57,949 --> 00:35:03,319
into that fund and then we will have a

789
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:06,170
committee that will decide based on the

790
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:07,519
research in the same way that national

791
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:10,369
organizations do it

792
00:35:07,519 --> 00:35:13,009
physicians researchers would ask for

793
00:35:10,369 --> 00:35:15,559
funding they'd have a study proposal and

794
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:18,590
that organization with the funds from

795
00:35:15,559 --> 00:35:21,440
all the LPS would then allocate those

796
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:23,840
funds for various research projects so

797
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:26,630
it's not just one LP it's all of them

798
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:30,590
because in the end I think it benefits

799
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:33,710
us all and and if if the LPS grow the

800
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:39,380
market necessarily write their piece of

801
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:42,260
the action grows with it absolutely

802
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:44,690
absolutely absolutely yeah don't forget

803
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:46,340
the right deals at the Alzheimer's the

804
00:35:44,690 --> 00:35:49,400
numbers in Canada are growing by twenty

805
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:51,620
five thousand people a year so if you

806
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:53,720
multiply that by ten in the US which is

807
00:35:51,619 --> 00:35:55,519
generally the race who we use you're

808
00:35:53,719 --> 00:35:58,389
getting two hundred and fifty thousand

809
00:35:55,519 --> 00:36:02,259
more patients with Alzheimer's a year

810
00:35:58,389 --> 00:36:02,259
that's a lot of nursing home care

811
00:36:04,059 --> 00:36:08,539
now just make a comment I appreciate you

812
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:11,240
preliminary findings sort of like Des

813
00:36:08,539 --> 00:36:13,009
Moines the extension at the same time we

814
00:36:11,239 --> 00:36:15,229
need to also be look at the elderly

815
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:17,060
you know I grunt an elderly outpatient

816
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:19,010
clinic and you know I'm thinking about

817
00:36:17,059 --> 00:36:21,049
the patient with osteoarthritis who

818
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:23,270
can't take an NSAID because they have an

819
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:24,920
impaired clinic liver and renal function

820
00:36:23,269 --> 00:36:26,449
