1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,919

00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:07,770
we de booth on the spannabis in

00:00:04,919 --> 00:00:10,740
Barcelona this is Carrie hi Gary hi mica

4
00:00:07,769 --> 00:00:13,259
and this is mica and what are you doing

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:15,570
here what year from Austria yes I'm from

6
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:18,510
Austria I'm working for the IBEW kana

7
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:21,269
I'm here for connecting people also for

8
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:24,630
the CBD business for getting certified

9
00:00:21,269 --> 00:00:26,939
products for patient-focused certified

10
00:00:24,629 --> 00:00:30,989
products and yeah I'm also connecting

11
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:33,149
with fo veda and and as I know as far as

12
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:36,420
I'm concerned as in your country

13
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:39,570
cannabis is not legalized medicine we

14
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:42,570
have only medical cannabis in form of

15
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:45,869
spray and removing all drops but not

16
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:47,820
like in Germany with flowers yeah in

17
00:00:45,869 --> 00:00:49,649
Germany we mean while we can have

18
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:51,719
flowers in the pharmacy which is quite

19
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:56,969
cool we even have a dream burst

20
00:00:51,719 --> 00:01:00,808
sometimes and but it's expandable so

21
00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:03,539
yeah what about Austria yeah Austria is

22
00:01:00,808 --> 00:01:09,478
going a little bit backwards in the in

23
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:13,290
the legalization process yeah they want

24
00:01:09,478 --> 00:01:15,688
now that also CBD product getting under

25
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:17,909
the noble foods and so it's also

26
00:01:15,688 --> 00:01:21,750
complicated in Austria for the medical

27
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:22,979
cannabis right now so what do you I

28
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:25,500
think it's a quite different situation

29
00:01:22,978 --> 00:01:29,188
in Germany all the investors come from

30
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:31,790
Canada from the US yeah it's it's the

31
00:01:29,188 --> 00:01:35,368
biggest as you say the biggest and

32
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:38,360
fastest raised business and Austria is

33
00:01:35,368 --> 00:01:42,000
miss missing this and yeah hopefully

34
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:44,489
we're working also with together

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,530
governments to talk to them that we get

36
00:01:44,489 --> 00:01:48,569
in the other direction but don't you

37
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:50,820
think it's quite crazy because on the

38
00:01:48,569 --> 00:01:53,908
other hand you have all those legal CVD

39
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:56,129
but you have those clone businesses even

40
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:58,229
though where people make millions you

41
00:01:56,129 --> 00:02:00,780
know you are freaking clones in austria

42
00:01:58,228 --> 00:02:03,718
don't you they are till now till now yes

43
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:07,079
but the new government tried to prohibit

44
00:02:03,718 --> 00:02:09,780
the clones so we had now in October a

45
00:02:07,078 --> 00:02:11,699
changing of the CBD product so now it's

46
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,640
a big confusion Austria what is legal

47
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:14,949
what

48
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:18,609
but as you said the other the clones and

49
00:02:14,949 --> 00:02:20,469
also CBD flowers are legal and quite

50
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:24,600
difficult so you still can make good

51
00:02:20,469 --> 00:02:24,599
money with the legal cannabis laws yeah

52
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:32,759
man and as for a gherkin are you doing

53
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:36,520
that the AG economy argh Akana is a

54
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:40,289
patient-focused non-government

55
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:43,750
organisation we are helping introducing

56
00:02:40,289 --> 00:02:45,549
people patients with medical cannabis we

57
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:49,830
have talked to us we introduce them to

58
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:55,630
doctors we make information events and

59
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:59,230
also we created a certification process

60
00:02:55,629 --> 00:03:02,500
for CBD products on the European market

61
00:02:59,229 --> 00:03:07,000
we want a price on the eye CPC for our

62
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:08,860
work in December in Austria and yeah

63
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,060
this this work we start now for whole

64
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:14,950
Europe and it's getting bigger and also

65
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:19,420
companies want to get certified from us

66
00:03:14,949 --> 00:03:22,539
to get honest certification so you in

67
00:03:19,419 --> 00:03:24,369
the legal CVD business and you know in

68
00:03:22,539 --> 00:03:26,289
the state's this one is I think in the

69
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:29,890
United States and Canada this is very

70
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:31,349
different because in Germany cannabis as

71
00:03:29,889 --> 00:03:34,419
a medicine is legal now

72
00:03:31,349 --> 00:03:37,829
but the grassroots movement cannot

73
00:03:34,419 --> 00:03:41,379
invest anything because it's mostly big

74
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:43,150
pharmaceutical companies or big foreign

75
00:03:41,379 --> 00:03:46,329
companies moving in because you need

76
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:47,920
millions to be on the legal market

77
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:50,290
before you have a product on the market

78
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:52,839
you need millions in Austria it's better

79
00:03:50,289 --> 00:03:55,739
when you have any attempts growth CBD on

80
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:57,650
a smaller range and open the shop and

81
00:03:55,740 --> 00:04:00,969
so legal CBB bathroom

82
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:04,879
oh wow do you think good is not any good

83
00:04:00,969 --> 00:04:07,009
yeah you're right but I think the

84
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:09,109
problem is with the mr. cannabis market

85
00:04:07,009 --> 00:04:11,539
you cannot compare cannabis as a

86
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:15,850
pharmaceutical product it's not it's not

87
00:04:11,539 --> 00:04:18,560
possible so cannabis should be

88
00:04:15,849 --> 00:04:20,719
differently cleared for as a

89
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,180
pharmaceutical standard because always

90
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:28,580
the compounds with the interaction fact

91
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:32,650
and all the the the workflow of terpenes

92
00:04:28,579 --> 00:04:35,569
cannabinoids and altogether neither a

93
00:04:32,649 --> 00:04:37,728
separate classification of the product

94
00:04:35,569 --> 00:04:39,860
and not as a certain as a pharmaceutical

95
00:04:37,728 --> 00:04:42,168
brother that's that's the wrong way

96
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:44,629
where we are looking for and also the

97
00:04:42,168 --> 00:04:46,599
investors and governments that's my

98
00:04:44,629 --> 00:04:50,629
point of view

99
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:52,310
yeah Germany it's also kind of yeah

100
00:04:50,629 --> 00:04:54,978
everybody is waiting

101
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:56,660
that also you know smaller businesses

102
00:04:54,978 --> 00:04:59,899
can invest at the moment is really

103
00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:02,570
hurtful because CBD is kind of not

104
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:05,598
illegal but it's not as legal as in

105
00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:08,089
Austria we cannot really sell CBD but we

106
00:05:05,598 --> 00:05:12,050
only killed sell supplemental products

107
00:05:08,089 --> 00:05:14,979
and you have a lot of CBD like coffee

108
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:17,110
shops in Austria I saw that in Vienna

109
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:19,569
in the main street they have like coffee

110
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:21,699
shops or CBD Bartha that I cannot say

111
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:24,639
because I'm living now two years in

112
00:05:21,699 --> 00:05:28,449
Tenerife so I moved I moved to Tenerife

113
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:32,079
so but I I follow all the news in

114
00:05:28,449 --> 00:05:34,240
Austria but my base is in in Tenerife

115
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:36,009
so what scares me in Spain it's even

116
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,949
different than in Austria and in Germany

117
00:05:36,009 --> 00:05:41,409
yes we have more different than Spain we

118
00:05:38,949 --> 00:05:44,800
have the social gaps we can enter

119
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:47,650
official in social gaps as it's only

120
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:50,400
half legal kind of it's not no it's not

121
00:05:47,649 --> 00:05:54,539
legal it's also a gray area in Spain and

122
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:57,849
as we know for local people but also

123
00:05:54,540 --> 00:06:00,580
Barcelona is more touristic for in for

124
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:03,850
Tenerife as you know for our collapse we

125
00:06:00,579 --> 00:06:06,219
use it for our own people and not for

126
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:08,320
for the touristic what do you agree if I

127
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:11,020
say it's a little bit in the Europe it's

128
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:13,750
a little bit like in the US that it's

129
00:06:11,019 --> 00:06:17,589
like in the European community we have

130
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:19,930
27 States and we have about 25 different

131
00:06:17,589 --> 00:06:23,229
laws about cannabis or a state system of

132
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:25,959
cannabis is really this is really really

133
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:28,060
strange but I think the fewer of us will

134
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:30,849
understand it if they compare to their

135
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:32,350
situation maybe 10 years ago you know

136
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:34,720
they're very little few states where

137
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:36,939
cannabis was legal there very few states

138
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,160
where it was totally illegal then we

139
00:06:36,939 --> 00:06:42,550
have those states where it's like

140
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:44,270
half-baked or halfway go and this cap is

141
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:48,120
at Arctic

142
00:06:44,269 --> 00:06:51,689
yeah I agree with you totally okay and

143
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:54,259
how is prepare well the fair for me it's

144
00:06:51,689 --> 00:06:57,689
the second time at the spannabis and

145
00:06:54,259 --> 00:07:02,279
yeah it's a quite big fair quite busy

146
00:06:57,689 --> 00:07:05,579
now and yeah my job is done for today

147
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:10,169
and I will leave now to some social caps

148
00:07:05,579 --> 00:07:13,139
to meet also business people and yeah I

149
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:14,790
will do a little more work for weakness

150
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:16,620
you know I I work for weakness in

151
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:18,960

152
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:21,780
