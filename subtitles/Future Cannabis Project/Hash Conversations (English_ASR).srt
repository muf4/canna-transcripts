186
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,918
the text

187
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,399
smoking tech you asked me uh what i did

188
00:06:39,918 --> 00:06:43,599
before

189
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:44,318
cannabis and uh i did a few things man

190
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,000
like

191
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:47,919
but right before cannabis i was in the

192
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,800
hvac world you know

193
00:06:47,918 --> 00:06:51,359
doing a i was an air technician you know

doing

195
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,240
doing that and i chose that profession

196
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:58,478
because i used them poorly directly with

197
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:02,160
the campus industry you know

198
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:02,719
um but yeah before that i worked a few

199
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,439
jobs

200
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,120
and mainly it was like i worked at in

201
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:08,879
and out for like seven years and got a

202
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,598
really good idea of uh

203
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:12,159
training team building uh quality

204
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:15,120
control

205
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,160
production and then uh like customer

206
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,879
service

207
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,560
and then i moved on went to school and

208
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:21,360

fuck yeah went into sales with hvac

211
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:28,959
and then on my way out into the camps

212
00:07:27,918 --> 00:07:31,598
industry

213
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:32,399
i got a warehouse job and then just like

214
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:34,800
peace out

215
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:37,359
you know i did my own thing and all

216
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,840
during that time i was always

217
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,560
doing what i could you know on the side

218
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:42,239
you know

219
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,319
after the nine to five you know trying

220
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,079
to be trying to get my experience you

221
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:47,598
know i said i was throwing for

222
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:50,560
like a year and a half and then i was

223
00:07:47,598 --> 00:07:52,639
making hash you know while i was working

224
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,598
and then i finally stove already you

225
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,240
know

226
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:58,319
and uh about a year and a half later man

227
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,079
i'm here and i feel like

228
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,759
i feel like it's been 10 years it's

229
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:03,680
crazy but it's only been like a year and

230
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:06,479
a half but i feel like it's been

231
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,519
such a long like a long short journey

232
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:10,959
you know

233
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:12,959

00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:14,959
fuck yeah so what what made you love

235
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:18,159
solvingless

236
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:18,959
good question man um back in the day man

237
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,000
back when like

238
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:22,478
phil probably first like invented it i

239
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,800
didn't

240
00:08:22,478 --> 00:08:26,478
like i wasn't deep in this theme but i'm

241
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,199
always a part of cannabis i remember my

242
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:29,598
friends

243
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:31,120
standing on uh hair straighteners and

244
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:33,038
doing the dabbing you know

245
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,278
i remember giving him an eighth of like

246
00:08:33,038 --> 00:08:36,319
my my best that i had like either it was

247
00:08:35,278 --> 00:08:39,759
bubba kush

248
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:43,519
or it was uh god's gift or it was um

249
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:45,360
something purple you know um gdp

250
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:47,440
but then he pressed it and i got like a

251
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,200
little sport out of it i got one dab

252
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,440
maybe like two dabs and i'm like math

253
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,839
fuck i want to smoke weed you know

254
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,519
but uh what got me into solving this was

255
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:57,120
basically my time you know i tried to

256
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,399
grow it my biggest dream was to be a

257
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,879
grower you know

258
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,000
um but at the time of me starting to

259
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:05,039
pursue the growing

260
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,519
side seriously i had uh

261
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:08,559
my son was being born but you know i had

262
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,399
a daughter already

263
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:12,000
like just recently married a headlock

264
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,839
going on and

265
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
you can't really allocate all the time

266
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,680
to the plan you know when you have

267
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,360
you know as a beginner i guess but i

268
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:21,919
tried i went through it all

269
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:24,000
and i went through all the you know all

270
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:26,479
the different like uh

271
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,839
mediums you know like rockwool coco core

272
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,920
and it all led to

273
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:32,480
uh living soil you know because my mind

274
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:35,278
was always about like what's the easiest

275
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,879
um this most sustainable you know and

276
00:09:35,278 --> 00:09:39,120
like i just want to add a water to these

277
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:42,559
bitches you know and grow the best i can

278
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:45,120
so i found uh jeremy at bill soil

279
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:46,159
followed him a lot and kind of took his

280
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,039
approach

281
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:50,079
and and uh started doing living soil and

282
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:53,360
then we had to move

283
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:56,800
and then i just couldn't grow anymore um

284
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,720
and i just started i always chased

285
00:09:56,799 --> 00:10:00,799
like the best quality you know smoke

286
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,440
like all of us mostly do you know

287
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:05,039
and so uh i used to do a lot of dabs and

288
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,480
shit and the pants came out and i'm like

289
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:08,000
ah fuck the pens and then that's just

290
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,000
kind of how i found solving this you

293
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:16,000

00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,519
feel represented by you know where

429
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:40,799
everything else all the other industries

430
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,720
are destroyed by like some

431
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:44,479
unattainable goals and shit it's like

432
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,440

you know remain how it is and we're

435
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:50,078
trying to keep it that way by putting

436
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:51,359
our passion in at 100

437
00:14:50,078 --> 00:14:52,879

he he held his coalition meeting it's

486
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:39,119
all about the grassroots guy

487
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:40,638
standing up and building their own seat

488
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,480
at this table

489
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:44,399
before all the corporations come in you

490
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,120

491
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,198

492
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,639

00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,480
beard bros myself and i think one more

498
00:16:57,039 --> 00:17:01,599
guy from l.a was like

499
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:03,600

500
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,599
surreal man being in a room full of

501
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:08,240
people like a whole like

502

going to be the year i do my single

545
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,519
source

546
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,038
i had a garden you know growing

547
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:38,160
vegetables

548
00:18:35,038 --> 00:18:40,000
and uh i had had a volunteers pop up

549
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,000
because uh sometimes i wash seated

550
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,319
material sometimes farmers get

551
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,279
you know how it goes see the material

552
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:47,119
and if it's not like

553
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:48,558
pollinator material if it's just like

554
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:51,199
seeded and not like

555
00:18:48,558 --> 00:18:54,240
you know dusted you can wash it and get

556
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:56,080
some fire from it totally oh totally

557
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,919
if he's pollinated you might get some

558
00:18:56,079 --> 00:18:59,119
like orangey looking rosin you know i

559
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:02,480
gotta be careful

560
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:04,558
but um yeah i got some volunteers man

561
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,240
and uh my wife's kind of crazy on dude

562
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:08,399
she'll she's been topping it down

563
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,319
because she's kind of against growing it

564
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,759
and for the neighbors to see we lived in

565
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:15,439
a close to neighborhood

566
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:16,558

i'll have to

598
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,559
i'll have to say that i i've been

599
00:20:20,558 --> 00:20:23,918
blessed to just work on uh splits and

600
00:20:22,558 --> 00:20:25,918
partnerships you know because

601
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:27,679
i'm willing to work with the farmer that

602
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:29,200
is only willing to give up their dry

603
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:30,798
trim or something you know

604
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,480
and i'm going to grow with the farmer

605
00:20:30,798 --> 00:20:34,400
from there and get their nugs and get

606
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,640
their fresh frozen musical

607
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,320
um i'm starting out small so i'm not

608
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,960
picky you know a lot of smash makers

609
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:41,119
they want

610
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,558
the best all the flower all of it you

611
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:44,000
know but

612
00:20:42,558 --> 00:20:45,839
i'm going to put a long ball in the long

613
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,240
term i'm willing to start small take the

614
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:48,079
trim

615
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:50,000
and get the big nugs and you know

616
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:52,079
because i know the growers have

617
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,359
systems already like you know 10-15

618
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:58,158
years

619
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:58,158
doing it you know and they were flower

620
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:03,200
yo totally no exactly for sure i agree

621
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:04,798
and i mean honestly being able to work

622
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,360
with trim is going to be something that

623
00:21:04,798 --> 00:21:07,918
no not a lot of people are able to do

624
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:10,079
and

625
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:11,360
as we we chatted about in the past like

626
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:12,000
you know not a lot of people know how to

627
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:13,519
make the best

628
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,798
material out of trim so it's like you

629
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:16,798
have to know how to actually make cash

630
00:21:14,798 --> 00:21:18,079
if you're working with trip

631
00:21:16,798 --> 00:21:20,480
so that's interesting and your stuff

632
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:23,599
looks fire dude so that's awesome

633
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:26,880
you know straight up

634
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:29,199
that's all yeah that's awesome yeah

635
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:31,280
yeah it's like for me it's kind of kind

636
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:34,880
of easy for that aspect you know i

637
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:37,839
have a few farms i work with um but

638
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,480
i know some i think it's kind of

639
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:40,079
accessible

640
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,079
in my area you know i feel like

641
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:44,319
everywhere i look it is but

642
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:46,079
i have to remember that i'm now like in

643
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:49,279
a world that's

644
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:50,158
that's uh you know so foreign to so many

645
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:53,359
people you know

646
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:54,799
and like my brother for example he just

647
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:57,119
drove down here from missouri

648
00:21:54,798 --> 00:21:58,879
and uh he's been here for about a week i

649
00:21:57,119 --> 00:22:00,798
put him in three different farms

650
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,720
and he's hashed out like two different

651
00:22:00,798 --> 00:22:04,319
times i give him like

652
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,000
five different tastes you know and it

653
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:07,599
just blew his mind of like he didn't

654
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,720
know it was even like

655
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:10,798
it was like this you know what i'm

656
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,558
saying so

657
00:22:10,798 --> 00:22:14,158
i think it's pretty easy but for the

658
00:22:12,558 --> 00:22:17,440
average joe i don't

659
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:17,919
i don't know i don't know it's gotta be

660
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:21,200
tough

661
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:23,280
you know but it's

662
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:25,200
crazy man right oh no actually it's a

663
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:27,678
great thing we need to continue to

664
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,319
spread our message and end the message

665
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,480
right now

666
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:31,839
just like that uh because some people

667
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,319
have looked at it like you know

668
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:35,839

669
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:39,119

673
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,240
if you really have the passion for it

674
00:22:44,798 --> 00:22:47,679
you will be able to make it happen the

675
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,240
same way you made it happen

676
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:50,720
i made it happen frank and anybody else

677
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:54,240

678
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:56,079
those that will come after us it's as

679
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,038
easy as that man if you if you want to

680
00:22:56,079 --> 00:22:58,240

you're already in here you just got to

682
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,079

683
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,759
catch up

684
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:05,359
it's as easy as that it's easy as that

685
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:06,480
with solving this too people are always

686
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:09,279
tripping on like

687
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,839
bag sizes and this and that it's as easy

688
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:12,000
as having

689
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:13,439
good starting material and making good

690
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,960
hash you know and

691
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,120
there's no secret everything else this

692
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,720
is all preference in my opinion you know

693
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:20,879
well tell us though what is good

694
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:23,360
starting material to you

695
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,799
fresh you know fresh is good fuck yeah

696
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:29,678
that's what i've been saying too so how

697
00:23:24,798 --> 00:23:31,679
fresh uh i say ideally

698
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:33,440
you know and and stretching it you know

699
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:33,919
it's pretty like stretching it as far as

700
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,480
i

701
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:39,038
can stretch it i would say no more than

702
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,038
two weeks

703
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:43,599
no more than that shooting for really no

704
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:46,960
more than 10 days

705
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:48,158
off the plant you know but if someone's

706
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:51,038
like

707
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:52,000
really want to try it out and they want

708
00:23:51,038 --> 00:23:54,720
you know

709
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,599
you know two weeks max you know i'm

710
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,558
saying but

711
00:23:55,599 --> 00:24:01,278
ideally five days right off the plan

712
00:23:58,558 --> 00:24:02,879
like fresh as possible you know and

713
00:24:01,278 --> 00:24:05,200
and you gotta keep it cold you know

714
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,000
preserve it you know washing right away

715
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,840
is good too

716
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,759
i found with trim um

717
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:15,519
washing right away is good freezing the

718
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:15,519
nugs you gotta freeze the nose but

719
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:22,079
yeah cool dude fuck yeah

720
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,278

what kind of press do you use also i

726
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:31,199
meant to ask that earlier what kind of

727
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,240
ros

728
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:36,319

731
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:42,960
on i feel like there's so much uh

732
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:44,960
paralysis analysis going on you know and

733
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,558

00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:08,079
around

745
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:14,798
let's see well it's a crd press it's

746
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:18,000
it's

747
00:25:14,798 --> 00:25:19,359
just a diy press kind of oh wow dude no

748
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,119
badass that's the best

749
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:22,558
i've seen videos of it now that you i

750
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:24,239
didn't realize it was a diy but that's

751
00:25:22,558 --> 00:25:26,000
badass man

752
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,440
yeah it's pretty cool i'll show you what

753
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,880
it came like

754
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:33,759
and the first press i had um it was a

755
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:35,440
you know i'll say commercial press

756
00:25:33,759 --> 00:25:38,000
meaning it was like

757
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:40,000
you know it was made commercially you

758
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,519
know it was a commercialized press it

759
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,359
was

760
00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:48,720
like 500 bucks but it was a two-ton

761
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:49,038
um it was a two-ton press and the plates

762
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,640
were

763
00:25:49,038 --> 00:25:52,480
two inches by two inches you know a

764
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:55,120
small little square so

765
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,640
which is which was kind of cool it got

766
00:25:55,119 --> 00:25:58,158
me started because i didn't have that

767
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,000
much material so it was like the plate

768
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:02,000
size was ideal you know

769
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,278
but uh it was kind of junky you know i

770
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,759
just i worked with it

771
00:26:03,278 --> 00:26:07,440
but when i found this this press i was

772
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:09,119
blown away i was like

773
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,880
it was day and night you know just for a

774
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:13,678
couple more hundred dollars

775
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:15,200
and it was a much much bigger place

776
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:16,240
these are four by eight plates that came

777
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:19,679
with originally

778
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:20,880
sick and uh you know this is the

779
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:24,080
original

780
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:26,159
harbor freight you know 20 ton hand pump

781
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:28,558
press which i prefer

782
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:29,760
i never time it this timer is used for

783
00:26:28,558 --> 00:26:31,599
my my washes

784
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:34,158
you know i don't time my rosin questions

785
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:37,599
i just every press is different you know

786
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:39,360
everyone's asking time temperature the

787
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:41,599
temperature is based on me loading the

788
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:43,839
bags how melty it is in the bags

789
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:45,439
and then then i go i choose the

790
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:48,480
temperature you know and then

791
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:51,679
what range what range do you choose from

792
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,000
okay so uh i say low range if it's like

793
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:54,000
really

794
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,000
melting in the bag like i'm gonna press

795
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:59,599
it at 160 170

796
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:03,759
okay maybe one maybe 180 you know

797
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:07,519
that's like a low range like 160 to 179

798
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:10,079
mid range is like 180 to 200 204

799
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:12,400
and then anything between like 205 to

800
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:15,599
220 is pretty high you know

801
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:20,320
okay i mainly immediately live

802
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:22,639
in the 180 to 200 degree range um

803
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:24,158
even when i do get a great shit that

804
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:27,278
melts awesome

805
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:29,520
and i can't press it out at 160.

806
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:31,119
um sometimes my workflow and this comes

807
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:32,480
kind of flowing i have a lot of work to

808
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:33,519
do i just got to get it done with the

809
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,919
180

810
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:36,720
but i'll do like one press at 160 just

811
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:38,240
to check it out

812
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,159
and then i'll finish like the next five

813
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,839
presses at 180 and just kind of get back

814
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:45,760
in the rhythm you know what i'm saying

815
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:49,038
awesome fuck yeah yeah and as this press

816
00:27:45,759 --> 00:27:49,679
has done so good um i've had it for a

817
00:27:49,038 --> 00:27:52,879
long time

818
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:54,480
i am actually looking at upgrading

819
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:57,360
you know i've already did some upgrades

820
00:27:54,480 --> 00:28:02,399
to it i had him change out the place

821
00:27:57,359 --> 00:28:04,798
because um i liked i like how my bag

822
00:28:02,398 --> 00:28:06,719
it fit better on these plates and the

823
00:28:04,798 --> 00:28:09,359
rosin floors off faster

824
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:11,120
kind of got the idea from uh looking at

825
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:13,599
peer pressure plates you know

826
00:28:11,119 --> 00:28:15,678
how they're long and skinny but i could

827
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:17,439
have the bag sitting on here

828
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:19,519
and then there's just about like an

829
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:21,038
eighth or a quarter inch on both sides

830
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:22,158
and the rods will fall off pretty

831
00:28:21,038 --> 00:28:26,960
quickly

832
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:31,440
dude that's fine i like that a lot

833
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:32,960
but um yeah you know

834
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,480
always room for improvement you know

835
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,319
with everything

836
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,000
totally no that's fucking awesome man i

837
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:41,439

00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,200
you know i i am not too up you know

839

up to date with all the machines so i

840
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:47,200
just figured it was a legit one

841
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:48,798

843
00:28:48,798 --> 00:28:52,240
i don't use it too often anymore but it

844
00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:53,119
was really fun it was like the trip mode

845
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:56,240
he has it

846
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:57,599
on a cradle yeah it could uh it's

847
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,558
against the wall a little bit but it

848
00:28:57,599 --> 00:29:01,599
could it can go

849
00:28:58,558 --> 00:29:04,319
full you know 180 degrees flat yeah

850
00:29:01,599 --> 00:29:05,678
gotcha yeah that's badass and you know

851
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:08,079
the moment came out

852
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:09,278
a while ago you know it's pretty dope it

853
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:12,639
could just

854
00:29:09,278 --> 00:29:14,798
drip all out right but

855
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:16,799
my plates are so small the rosin flows

856
00:29:14,798 --> 00:29:20,240
off quickly

857
00:29:16,798 --> 00:29:20,240
having it straight up and down is nice

858
00:29:20,558 --> 00:29:24,558
yeah fuck

859
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:30,459
style yeah that's awesome dude

860
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:30,459
[Music]

861
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:36,398
yeah so you said you had a story on the

862
00:29:35,119 --> 00:29:39,678
press

863
00:29:36,398 --> 00:29:40,000
oh my bad brother that slurping slapped

864
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:43,679
me

865
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,079
a little bit the uh oh basically the

866
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:45,200
story

867
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:47,199
pretty much i kind of said it a little

868
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:49,919
bit uh it was it was a

869
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:51,919
like a 500 price and it was small it was

870
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:53,520
two times small plates

871
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:55,360
um when i when i would press it the

872
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:57,440
whole thing would rock you know i had to

873
00:29:55,359 --> 00:29:59,839
like really hold it with one hand

874
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,558
press it with the other you know and

875
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:02,079
like

876
00:30:00,558 --> 00:30:03,359
you know it was kind of hard it was a

877
00:30:02,079 --> 00:30:05,359
learning press but it was pretty

878
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:08,639
expensive learning press

879
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:11,038
and uh this one like i said it was only

880
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:13,440
it was like 800 bucks you know and it

881
00:30:11,038 --> 00:30:15,359
it kills it in volume it's 20 ton the

882
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:17,679
plates are bigger way bigger

883
00:30:15,359 --> 00:30:18,798
it's way sturdier way heavier i don't

884
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:20,640
need to like

885
00:30:18,798 --> 00:30:22,639
babysit it hold it with one hand and

886
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:25,759
press it with the other hand

887
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:27,840
so it was just the real lesson there for

888
00:30:25,759 --> 00:30:29,919
me was just like

889
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:31,519
i always kind of had past things like

890
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:32,880
going with family owned or going with a

891
00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:35,038
small guy you know

892
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,399
at least first you know if you're just

893
00:30:35,038 --> 00:30:38,240
getting into it

894
00:30:36,398 --> 00:30:39,918
go with the small guy first and check it

895
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,798
out and see if you like what you're

896
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:43,840
going to do before you

897
00:30:40,798 --> 00:30:45,359
invest on the big big big you know fancy

898
00:30:43,839 --> 00:30:47,278
stuff but

899
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:50,000
i bought like the name brand thing and

900
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:51,679
then you know i found this guy and he's

901
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,960
local

902
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:56,240
close fuck yeah you know he's a guy just

903
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,240
like me trying to

904
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:00,798
build his name and build the spot you

905
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:02,319
know throw a seat at the table you know

906
00:31:00,798 --> 00:31:03,519
that's awesome man that's awesome that's

907
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:04,398
also what i really enjoy about the

908
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:05,839
solving this thing it's like

909
00:31:04,398 --> 00:31:07,518
representing the farming

910
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:10,398
representing the quality of the farmer

911
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:13,440
and it's a teamwork process you know

912
00:31:10,398 --> 00:31:13,439
so that's fucking awesome

913
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:18,798
100 man 100

914
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:20,479
it's all about the farmer for me because

915
00:31:18,798 --> 00:31:23,599
i feel like i've lived off the farmer

916
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:25,519
like most of my life you know and that's

917
00:31:23,599 --> 00:31:28,719
why i really want to

918
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:30,720
like the solving this wave seems to be

919
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,720
not gonna stop and gonna be like the new

920
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:36,000
thing and i think it's really going to

921
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:36,880
change as the industry is becoming this

922
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,919
new

923
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:42,399
legal conglomerate solveless

924
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:44,640
is right with it and it's all this is

925
00:31:42,398 --> 00:31:46,558
new the legalization is new and i think

926
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,159
it's going to be a pretty big thing and

927
00:31:46,558 --> 00:31:50,158
a lot of these farmers man they're old

928
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:53,120
school farmers and they've been growing

929
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:54,880
for me for a long time and i feel like

930
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:55,918
it's my duty to help these farmers and

931
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,159
give back and just

932
00:31:55,919 --> 00:32:00,000
and share all my knowledge as i can you

933
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:01,120
know help them fuck yeah produce their

934
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,880
own solve on this line

935
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:05,038
you know at least get the basics down

936
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:07,840
get them started get the wheels moving

937
00:32:05,038 --> 00:32:09,038
and you know they're growers man they

938
00:32:07,839 --> 00:32:10,480
know what to do from there you know what

939
00:32:09,038 --> 00:32:14,480
i'm saying

940
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:16,798
fuck yeah dude are you a grower

941
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:18,240
i say i'm a grower i grew i grew up here

942
00:32:16,798 --> 00:32:18,720
and there just for something giggles

943
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,798
like

944
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:22,319
you know nothing serious though it

945
00:32:20,798 --> 00:32:25,918
wasn't until

946
00:32:22,319 --> 00:32:26,158
i decided to like um you know that this

947
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:27,600
is

948
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:30,240
what i want to do i started growing

949
00:32:27,599 --> 00:32:32,879
seriously and then

950
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,278
in growing like in growing and finding

951
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:37,519
my

952
00:32:33,278 --> 00:32:40,240
style which is like a living soil

953
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:41,679
method that's the style i put my

954
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,399
preference if i were to grow again would

955
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:44,399
be that

956
00:32:42,398 --> 00:32:45,918
fuck yeah like once i started growing

957
00:32:44,398 --> 00:32:49,439
and i found my style

958
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:50,399
i had to move and uh circumstances

959
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,919
changed

960
00:32:50,398 --> 00:32:54,798
and then that's how i found myself on

961
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:54,799
this you know

962
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:58,079
window fuck yeah things will happen for

963
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,480
a reason you know

964
00:32:58,079 --> 00:33:02,079
i really want to be a grower never knew

965
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:04,798
about solving this and now i'm like

966
00:33:02,079 --> 00:33:05,199
super passionate about this like with my

967
00:33:04,798 --> 00:33:07,278
ac

968
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,798
not working right now i haven't brought

969
00:33:07,278 --> 00:33:11,440
washed in about

970
00:33:08,798 --> 00:33:13,200
a week and i've been working having a

971
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,000
little depression with it man and having

972
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,558
to like

973
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,319
remember to refocus my energy that i'm

974
00:33:16,558 --> 00:33:20,079
i'm kind of rebuilding the room

975
00:33:18,319 --> 00:33:21,839
and when it's going again i want to

976
00:33:20,079 --> 00:33:23,038
crush it harder you know so that makes

977
00:33:21,839 --> 00:33:24,398
me happy it's like

978
00:33:23,038 --> 00:33:26,000
it's a weird balance that i'm playing

979
00:33:24,398 --> 00:33:26,798
with myself you know it's like i want to

980
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,398
wash

981
00:33:26,798 --> 00:33:30,319
oh be patient because you're going to

982
00:33:28,398 --> 00:33:31,599
crush you know it's like yeah i'm going

983
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:33,678
to crush and then

984
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:38,719
oh fuck i want to wash all this

985
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:41,519
beautiful shit in the freezer right now

986
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:43,919
seriously bro no i feel that for sure

987
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:47,359
what's going on with your ac

988
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:49,759
uh basic capacitor went out and the

989
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:51,278
the part at the stores it won't fit in

990
00:33:49,759 --> 00:33:52,480
the compartment so i have to order

991
00:33:51,278 --> 00:33:55,278
direct and

992
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:57,200
it's like a week out or whatever but

993
00:33:55,278 --> 00:34:00,480
i've been wanting to get an ice machine

994
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:02,960
so i've ordered the ice machine as well

995
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:04,240
and that's pretty much almost all i

996
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:08,079
really need man besides

997
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:10,878
some new reservoirs and maybe a sink

998
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:11,280
and this would be a good machine man for

999

00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:14,240
right usually it's the trashies you know

1016
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,559
i usually kind of mostly throw the 160

1017
00:35:14,239 --> 00:35:19,039
bag out in the 190 bag out

1018
00:35:16,559 --> 00:35:19,920
right or save it if it's clean but

1019
00:35:19,039 --> 00:35:23,679
usually it's all

1020
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,680
plant plant materials up or something

1021

00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:35,200

nice maybe double bag

1028
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:46,240
220 just to make sure no plant material

1029
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:50,400
gets in there

1030
00:35:46,239 --> 00:35:54,000

00:37:30,639 --> 00:37:35,598
that's actually uh that grows in soil

1058
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,679
you know i'm super excited to work with

1059
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:39,280
him nice and he's got some pretty cool

1060
00:37:37,679 --> 00:37:44,559
flavors too man

1061
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:46,960
fuck yeah so so that's indoor

1062
00:37:44,559 --> 00:37:49,119
pandora yeah he has indoor and he grows

1063
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:51,519
in a bunch of soil pots you know

1064
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:52,800
awesome so if do you know any when you

1065
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:54,480
were talking about growing indoor

1066
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,680
or i mean growing living soil were you

1067
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,119
talking about growing and doing indoor

1068
00:37:55,679 --> 00:37:58,639
grow

1069
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:00,400
that's where that's where that's what i

1070
00:37:58,639 --> 00:38:01,598
was doing yeah i was indoor and i had

1071
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:04,400
hps at the time

1072
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:05,359
but my goal was to get leds you know but

1073
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,039
then

1074
00:38:05,358 --> 00:38:08,880
you know that's what that's what my idea

1075
00:38:07,039 --> 00:38:11,039
was like

1076
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,400
yeah can you can you tell jim about that

1077
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:14,159
situation because basically he knows

1078
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,920
more than i do about the actual growing

1079
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:17,199
process but i know a lot of people

1080
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,960
and i'm very interested in the living

1081
00:38:17,199 --> 00:38:20,480
soil thing so he said a couple things

1082
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:22,559
like it would take a lot of ventilation

1083
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:24,639
and stuff so i'm very curious he had

1084
00:38:22,559 --> 00:38:26,960
i'm curious how many lights did you have

1085
00:38:24,639 --> 00:38:28,799
in that group oh man no it was a

1086
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:31,358
this is a closet grow you know it's like

1087
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:34,800
experimental i was doing you know

1088
00:38:31,358 --> 00:38:37,679
it was it never got to um like

1089
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:38,000
the real deal you know it was like it's

1090
00:38:37,679 --> 00:38:40,319
so

1091
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,199
hard to do it on a large scale that's

1092
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:44,240
why

1093
00:38:41,199 --> 00:38:45,519
to me it's very hard to do on a larger

1094
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:47,679
scale to me

1095
00:38:45,519 --> 00:38:49,519
and i'm excited to find out how it can

1096
00:38:47,679 --> 00:38:52,319
be done

1097
00:38:49,519 --> 00:38:53,920
oh man i've seen um i don't i can't say

1098
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,480
i'll have my head but i've seen some

1099
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,720
guys

1100
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:58,240
on you know future canvas projects he

1101
00:38:56,719 --> 00:39:01,199
did some interviews of

1102
00:38:58,239 --> 00:39:02,959
some pretty big facilities in uh in

1103
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:06,480
nevada

1104
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:09,679
oh what's a place called

1105
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:13,599
darn somewhere in nevada close to vegas

1106
00:39:09,679 --> 00:39:17,118
and that facility is on point

1107
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:19,280
like he had living soil down in my

1108
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:21,680
opinion like there's something

1109
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,680
sometimes

1110
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:26,159
alien labs all those like very well

1111
00:39:25,519 --> 00:39:28,480
known

1112
00:39:26,159 --> 00:39:30,319
companies that are all from la and yeah

1113
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,800
big money and but big advertising and

1114
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,559
stuff

1115
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,839
a lot of it but but the thing is what's

1116
00:39:32,559 --> 00:39:35,358
cool to me is that

1117
00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:37,199
nature ended up prevailing it's like

1118
00:39:35,358 --> 00:39:39,119
living soil ended up speaking so loud

1119
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:41,279
that that's what's truly represented by

1120
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:43,039
that stuff is that the quality is in the

1121
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:44,560
is in the soil being alive and feeding

1122
00:39:43,039 --> 00:39:46,559
it properly and you know not just

1123
00:39:44,559 --> 00:39:48,639
feeding it salts or whatever the fucking

1124
00:39:46,559 --> 00:39:50,159
you know bullshit so it's very inch it's

1125
00:39:48,639 --> 00:39:52,639
extremely interesting to me

1126
00:39:50,159 --> 00:39:55,118
but um you know matt rise are you

1127

1138
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:19,440
into it until just like

1139
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:20,560
past couple years but i didn't know of

1140
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:23,440
him for sure

1141
00:40:20,559 --> 00:40:24,000
you know and i see him i think he's

1142
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:27,039
viewed as

1143
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,719
like a leader in the industry you know i

1144
00:40:27,039 --> 00:40:30,480
hear he's an interesting character for

1145
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:32,480
sure with the cat with the hash stuff

1146
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:34,079
i'm just like recently i've just seen

1147
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:35,599
him post a lot of stuff that's all

1148
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:38,480
living soil indoor so i'm like

1149
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:39,838
okay it really is like you know it's the

1150
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:43,119
shit

1151
00:40:39,838 --> 00:40:44,880
you can't find it man i mean you you see

1152
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:46,880
like no one can fight it it's weird it's

1153
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:49,039
a living it's like you feed the soil

1154
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:50,000
the soil is going to feed the plant and

1155
00:40:49,039 --> 00:40:52,400
it just proves it

1156
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,159
and i'm not denying like because i work

1157
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:55,838
with farmers that would grow assaults

1158
00:40:54,159 --> 00:40:58,078
and then they crush it as well

1159
00:40:55,838 --> 00:40:59,920
and it's pretty clean solvents i know

1160
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:01,599
people kind of some people hate on me

1161
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:03,599
that's really interesting that's awesome

1162
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:04,079
because the reason i asked originally

1163
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:06,318
here

1164
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:07,519
about um about sourcing solventless in

1165
00:41:06,318 --> 00:41:09,039
l.a it's just because

1166
00:41:07,519 --> 00:41:11,039
straight up i mean you're posting on

1167
00:41:09,039 --> 00:41:12,960
fire but we literally like tried to

1168
00:41:11,039 --> 00:41:16,239
source on the on the rec market

1169
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:18,960
um you know material out of la and we

1170
00:41:16,239 --> 00:41:19,759
found a few good sources but more so we

1171
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:22,079
got stuff that

1172
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:23,280
we weren't able to wash you know like it

1173
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:25,039
didn't come out like and that's just

1174
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,440
from the wreck market so i knew already

1175
00:41:25,039 --> 00:41:26,880
that

1176
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:28,240
you know obviously people are growing a

1177
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,640
lot of material down there and stuff

1178
00:41:28,239 --> 00:41:30,078
like that

1179
00:41:28,639 --> 00:41:31,598
but i was just curious how it is because

1180
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:31,920
i see you post a lot of fire and stuff

1181
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:34,480
so

1182
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:36,400
it was very it's very intriguing to me

1183
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:37,039
it's all in the grower man because i

1184
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,720
worked

1185
00:41:37,039 --> 00:41:40,800
and i'm walking throwing the one under

1186
00:41:38,719 --> 00:41:43,199
the bus but i worked with his partner

1187
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:45,359
and his ex partner and washed his stuff

1188
00:41:43,199 --> 00:41:48,159
from his row

1189
00:41:45,358 --> 00:41:49,519
no but this dude his bro it came out

1190
00:41:48,159 --> 00:41:52,318
nice you know and this is like

1191
00:41:49,519 --> 00:41:53,440
after this they split up and i think

1192
00:41:52,318 --> 00:41:55,440
maybe it's the flush

1193
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:56,480
but the salt i haven't i don't know i

1194
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:59,760
don't i don't grow

1195
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:02,559
you know but i am actually

1196
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:04,160
because i i'm working with a a new

1197
00:42:02,559 --> 00:42:06,799
farmer that's living soil

1198
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:08,078
and i expected it to like kick its ass

1199
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:10,240
you know i'm like oh man

1200
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:11,519
if the salt hash is fire this guy's just

1201
00:42:10,239 --> 00:42:14,719
gonna be great

1202
00:42:11,519 --> 00:42:16,800
um and it was great you know but when i

1203
00:42:14,719 --> 00:42:19,358
go back and forth i'm like ah

1204
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:21,599
you know it's the salt one's maybe

1205
00:42:19,358 --> 00:42:23,358
cleaner but maybe because i'm also

1206
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:24,960
very very familiar with that guy's

1207
00:42:23,358 --> 00:42:26,880
interior material

1208
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:28,079
and the living soil material is super

1209
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:30,240
new and

1210
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:32,480
the first round he gave to me it wasn't

1211
00:42:30,239 --> 00:42:34,000
um you know his first round

1212
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:35,358
and it wasn't ideal i had a lot of

1213
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,599
families in it you know and i had to

1214
00:42:35,358 --> 00:42:40,799
tell him to take the van leaf out and

1215
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:42,880
he did it great

1216
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:44,000
we're gonna grow pretty well i think i'm

1217
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,838
pretty excited

1218
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,440
about this new relationship fuck yeah

1219
00:42:45,838 --> 00:42:49,599
dude that's awesome i love that

1220
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:50,720
so much the grower and the hatch maker

1221
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:52,079
that's what i call it so if you

1222
00:42:50,719 --> 00:42:54,078
dude if you work with somebody that you

1223
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:55,920
would like to do an interview with and

1224
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:57,200
help and like talk to them and stuff i'd

1225
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:58,400
really like to do that that's

1226
00:42:57,199 --> 00:43:01,039
one of my things i want to write

1227
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:02,880
articles about that i've written a few

1228
00:43:01,039 --> 00:43:04,400
thus far and that that's one of my goals

1229
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:06,720
is to kind of you know

1230
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:08,559
the the relationship between the farmer

1231
00:43:06,719 --> 00:43:09,358
and the person that's making the stuff

1232
00:43:08,559 --> 00:43:12,159
into hash

1233
00:43:09,358 --> 00:43:13,598
you know it's intense oh yeah everything

1234

oh i was just gonna say i'm doing an

1247
00:43:34,318 --> 00:43:38,159
indoor i'll send you a link to the

1248
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:40,160
indoor we're putting together in

1249
00:43:38,159 --> 00:43:41,440
oklahoma yeah i figured you would be

1250
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:44,078
able to answer some questions

1251
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:46,639
about the uh indoor and the the living

1252
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:48,640
soil and scaling and stuff like that

1253
00:43:46,639 --> 00:43:50,480
yeah you might have something to do

1254
00:43:48,639 --> 00:43:52,639
that's it

1255
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:53,679
i was gonna say he's he's on point don't

1256
00:43:52,639 --> 00:43:55,598
get me wrong there's a couple of

1257
00:43:53,679 --> 00:43:57,279
questions actually a fellow in oklahoma

1258
00:43:55,599 --> 00:44:00,720
and i know quite a few they're

1259
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:02,480
doing living so it's just uh there's

1260
00:44:00,719 --> 00:44:03,919
two different angles to the you know

1261
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:06,318
every piece has a fit

1262
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:08,159
and not every fit has a piece put it

1263
00:44:06,318 --> 00:44:10,639
this way not everybody

1264
00:44:08,159 --> 00:44:11,838
you know should do the same thing put it

1265
00:44:10,639 --> 00:44:14,318
that way

1266
00:44:11,838 --> 00:44:16,078
and the environment there because of the

1267
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:17,759
the weather and different things if

1268
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:19,039
you're going to do an indoor then

1269
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:21,599
you're sealing it up and if you're

1270
00:44:19,039 --> 00:44:24,000
sealing it up and you bring in dirt

1271
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:25,519
and you have to have bugs to make your

1272
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,159
living soil work

1273
00:44:25,519 --> 00:44:29,519
so then you've got to decide what cover

1274
00:44:28,159 --> 00:44:32,399
crops you want to grow

1275
00:44:29,519 --> 00:44:34,559
to keep the insects happy and not

1276
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:36,480
attacking your pot plants

1277
00:44:34,559 --> 00:44:38,960
so they're eating the other things

1278
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:41,599
you're growing rather than your weed

1279
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:43,119
and it's a competition so living soil

1280
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:45,119
takes a couple of

1281
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:46,640
rolls a couple of turns a couple of

1282
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:50,000
grows to get

1283
00:44:46,639 --> 00:44:53,519
the soil right then you get into

1284
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:55,199
mode per se and even the bester only is

1285
00:44:53,519 --> 00:44:57,199
so good

1286
00:44:55,199 --> 00:44:58,318
and that's where the difference is if

1287
00:44:57,199 --> 00:45:01,679
you're you know an

1288
00:44:58,318 --> 00:45:04,559
indoor the easier quicker and

1289
00:45:01,679 --> 00:45:07,358
cleaner operation to keep everything fda

1290
00:45:04,559 --> 00:45:11,358
and all that fun stuff is to go

1291
00:45:07,358 --> 00:45:15,279
i don't i hate to say it it's true

1292
00:45:11,358 --> 00:45:18,400
and the living soil is just more work

1293
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:20,400
and and more attentive so you can do so

1294
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:23,119
there's all kinds of things you can do

1295
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:24,160
but not every operation is set up for

1296
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:25,200
that

1297
00:45:24,159 --> 00:45:26,960
so i'm going to look at you know what

1298
00:45:25,199 --> 00:45:27,598
are these guys used to doing how they've

1299
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:30,800
been doing

1300
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:33,838
it what do they do normally or have they

1301
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,839
even grown me

1302
00:45:35,358 --> 00:45:39,519
oh you got a big fight i know i would

1303
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,960
stick with your head i think i talked i

1304
00:45:39,519 --> 00:45:41,679
don't know if i interrupted you guys i

1305
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:44,079
apologize no

1306
00:45:41,679 --> 00:45:46,239
no no no no no yeah he's still on

1307
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:48,000
exactly yeah connected but that's where

1308
00:45:46,239 --> 00:45:49,598
living soil is great don't get me wrong

1309
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:52,719
i totally believe in it i

1310
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:54,880
i truly do but it's like anything else

1311
00:45:52,719 --> 00:45:56,239
when you're spending like the operation

1312
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:57,838
i'm talking about here

1313
00:45:56,239 --> 00:46:00,239
we're spending a quarter million dollars

1314
00:45:57,838 --> 00:46:03,519
on led lights

1315
00:46:00,239 --> 00:46:07,519
just for lights a half a million in soil

1316
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:09,519
a half a million in soil well you know

1317
00:46:07,519 --> 00:46:11,519
that's what i mean it's it's a relative

1318
00:46:09,519 --> 00:46:13,119
you know so you've already built a half

1319
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:14,719
million dollar building

1320
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:16,318
and then you've insulated that and you

1321
00:46:14,719 --> 00:46:18,239
get it done you know what i mean

1322
00:46:16,318 --> 00:46:20,318
and it just keeps adding up so you've

1323
00:46:18,239 --> 00:46:22,078
done that

1324
00:46:20,318 --> 00:46:23,679
you know you've got to figure out how

1325
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:26,000
you can be

1326
00:46:23,679 --> 00:46:27,759
on the market with a competitive product

1327
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,079
pretty darn quick and not have to go

1328
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:30,560
through

1329
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:31,440
those getting your soil right hands

1330
00:46:30,559 --> 00:46:33,199
maybe

1331
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:35,200
gotta feed those plants they gotta feed

1332
00:46:33,199 --> 00:46:36,879
you gotta feed them something

1333
00:46:35,199 --> 00:46:38,318
oh yeah yeah we're feeding them food

1334
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:40,079
it'll be a salt base you know what i

1335
00:46:38,318 --> 00:46:42,800
mean

1336
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:44,400
five more acres of doing outdoors so i'm

1337
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,720
gonna know where he's there i figure i

1338
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,559
can

1339
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:47,838
light up the outdoors so i'll be fine

1340
00:46:46,559 --> 00:46:50,159
and the

1341
00:46:47,838 --> 00:46:51,920
soil's already they grow trees there so

1342
00:46:50,159 --> 00:46:52,318
this operation was a tree farm to start

1343
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:54,960
with

1344
00:46:52,318 --> 00:46:56,480
and that's what they do already i've

1345
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:58,079
already got the people already got the

1346
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:00,960
equipment already got the land

1347
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:02,720
already got everything else he hired me

1348
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:05,440
and to do the consulting so that's what

1349
00:47:02,719 --> 00:47:05,439
i'm doing guys

1350
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:10,480
so that's what i'm doing when i grow up

1351
00:47:09,199 --> 00:47:13,039
we all do

1352
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:15,039
even when we grow up you know then back

1353
00:47:13,039 --> 00:47:17,519
in march i'll be there to start their uh

1354
00:47:15,039 --> 00:47:18,960
outdoor program because you know we got

1355
00:47:17,519 --> 00:47:22,800
to get things ready and then

1356
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:24,960
start early and do a couple light deaths

1357
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:24,960
how

1358
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:30,240
how big is the square footage like the

1359
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:33,039
property

1360
00:47:30,239 --> 00:47:35,598
oh it's a couple hundred acres over a

1361
00:47:33,039 --> 00:47:37,679
hundred hundred and a half 160

1362
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:40,079
something like that so i'm getting a

1363
00:47:37,679 --> 00:47:42,159
five acre parcel just for the week

1364
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:43,680
and then i've got the warehouses 20 000

1365
00:47:42,159 --> 00:47:45,920
square going up

1366
00:47:43,679 --> 00:47:47,838
three quarters building they're going in

1367
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:49,680
australia

1368
00:47:47,838 --> 00:47:51,920
the steam tape all the seams there's

1369
00:47:49,679 --> 00:47:53,118
totally no right leaks now so now

1370
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:54,000
they're going to go into foam spray the

1371
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:56,240
whole thing

1372
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,599
then all the pvc walls go in and

1373
00:47:56,239 --> 00:47:59,279
everything else for all the fda

1374
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:01,519
cleanliness and blah blah blah

1375
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:03,119
let's feel the cement about a hundred

1376
00:48:01,519 --> 00:48:05,119
thousand dollar freeze dryer coming so

1377
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:06,720
we're gonna do freeze-dried weed

1378
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:09,358
and we'll be able to do the bubble house

1379
00:48:06,719 --> 00:48:10,239
but i've already got 9091803 is hooked

1380
00:48:09,358 --> 00:48:13,279
up to do all the

1381
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:14,558
bubble hashing so i've hooked him up for

1382
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:15,519
everything we're just going to do the

1383
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:17,760
top buds

1384
00:48:15,519 --> 00:48:21,599
his shelf buds that's going to get

1385
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:23,839
freeze dried

1386
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:25,519
that's a great way to do it you know

1387
00:48:23,838 --> 00:48:27,759
save the big good buds for the packs

1388
00:48:25,519 --> 00:48:31,358
watch the rest you know and the other

1389
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:31,359
thing is there's nobody doing a

1390
00:48:31,519 --> 00:48:35,759
good size operation per se and doing any

1391
00:48:34,239 --> 00:48:37,199
freeze dry in there yet there's a couple

1392
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:38,640
little ones on the edges

1393
00:48:37,199 --> 00:48:41,519
you know doing small stuff but mainly

1394
00:48:38,639 --> 00:48:42,078
half so it's like anything else there's

1395
00:48:41,519 --> 00:48:43,920
not

1396
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:46,400
there's very few doing weed that's why i

1397
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:47,119
went talked to richard again with cannon

1398
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:49,838
freeze and

1399
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:51,519
and started working with him and can get

1400
00:48:49,838 --> 00:48:52,949
new units because i basically ran out of

1401
00:48:51,519 --> 00:48:54,159
reconditioned units

1402
00:48:52,949 --> 00:48:56,000
[Music]

1403
00:48:54,159 --> 00:48:57,199
the markets you know there's no more

1404
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,039
they don't make that many

1405
00:48:57,199 --> 00:49:00,639
you know when you get to in between a

1406
00:48:59,039 --> 00:49:02,639
harvest right and an

1407
00:49:00,639 --> 00:49:03,838
industrial there's only a few like the

1408
00:49:02,639 --> 00:49:05,838
lava rubber fork

1409
00:49:03,838 --> 00:49:07,838
you know that whistler is pushing around

1410
00:49:05,838 --> 00:49:10,639
they do they have dealers here too

1411
00:49:07,838 --> 00:49:11,358
and it's a very good machine you know if

1412
00:49:10,639 --> 00:49:13,679
you're going to buy

1413
00:49:11,358 --> 00:49:15,759
two or three pharmaceutics then maybe

1414
00:49:13,679 --> 00:49:18,078
you should buy one of those

1415
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:19,839
i think they replaced roughly two they

1416
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:20,240
say three but i think that's pushing the

1417
00:49:19,838 --> 00:49:23,039
edge

1418
00:49:20,239 --> 00:49:23,919
so have you seen anybody use the harvest

1419
00:49:23,039 --> 00:49:26,159
right uh

1420
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:28,079
deal yeah i was i was wrong with tyler

1421
00:49:26,159 --> 00:49:31,838
today there with worcester tech and i

1422
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:31,839
feel behind you

1423
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:39,680
a lot of times too where people get

1424
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:41,359
interrupted with freeze dryers is

1425
00:49:39,679 --> 00:49:42,960
you got to remember what you're doing

1426
00:49:41,358 --> 00:49:45,199
when you're supplementing

1427
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:47,280
bubble hatch you're not supplementing

1428
00:49:45,199 --> 00:49:49,279
the water through a tissue

1429
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:50,559
it's not in the trichome it's outside

1430
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:52,800
the tricode

1431
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:54,720
so it's very easy to sublimate water

1432
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:56,960
when it's not going through a tissue or

1433
00:49:54,719 --> 00:49:59,279
a material or a cell wall

1434
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:01,199
okay it's simple that's the easiest

1435
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:04,319
thing a freeze dryer could ever do

1436
00:50:01,199 --> 00:50:05,759
the trouble with them is their valving

1437
00:50:04,318 --> 00:50:08,400
and pressures

1438
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:09,520
and their algorithm is just not made for

1439
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:11,838
what we do

1440
00:50:09,519 --> 00:50:13,679
and it's slow not as delicate the plates

1441
00:50:11,838 --> 00:50:15,358
only heat on the top and the bottom not

1442
00:50:13,679 --> 00:50:17,598
each plate is heated

1443
00:50:15,358 --> 00:50:18,960
that's why the the leather bar you know

1444
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:21,119
it's 15 grand

1445
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:22,159
but basically by the time you get

1446
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:24,079
everything right you're going to be

1447
00:50:22,159 --> 00:50:26,879
about 20 grand for one of them

1448
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:28,318
right and now you can pair them up

1449
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:30,240
though you could run two of those off

1450
00:50:28,318 --> 00:50:31,119
one air air unit tyler was showing that

1451
00:50:30,239 --> 00:50:33,358
today

1452
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:35,440
it's a good unit there's nothing wrong

1453
00:50:33,358 --> 00:50:37,358
with it in fact it's very good because

1454
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:38,639
you get all the sensors you need and

1455
00:50:37,358 --> 00:50:42,159
everything else

1456
00:50:38,639 --> 00:50:44,799
goes down to 0.1

1457
00:50:42,159 --> 00:50:45,440
atmospheres so yeah it goes down to damn

1458
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:48,240
near

1459
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:48,240
flat zero

1460
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:51,519
so it's really pulling the vacuum and

1461
00:50:50,318 --> 00:50:53,358
that's the key and then the

1462
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:54,480
refrigeration units are the right sides

1463
00:50:53,358 --> 00:50:55,358
and the temperature probes are in the

1464
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:57,679
right place

1465
00:50:55,358 --> 00:50:59,358
that's what matters you know the

1466
00:50:57,679 --> 00:51:01,358
algorithm on that and that's where

1467
00:50:59,358 --> 00:51:02,719
drying weeds the same way there's been

1468
00:51:01,358 --> 00:51:04,159
some issues with wheat and that's where

1469
00:51:02,719 --> 00:51:06,399
people have had problems is

1470
00:51:04,159 --> 00:51:07,838
harvest rights don't don't evaporate

1471
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:09,280
properly in valving that's they're just

1472
00:51:07,838 --> 00:51:10,639
bad you can actually buy

1473
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:12,720
if you want a new weed in a harvest

1474
00:51:10,639 --> 00:51:14,239
right there's about a 2500

1475
00:51:12,719 --> 00:51:15,838
algorithm and a couple of valving

1476
00:51:14,239 --> 00:51:16,239
attacks which you can buy through this

1477
00:51:15,838 --> 00:51:19,519
other

1478
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:21,519
lab company that makes them work better

1479
00:51:19,519 --> 00:51:23,199
quote unquote but you know if you're

1480
00:51:21,519 --> 00:51:23,679
already spinning four grand or five

1481
00:51:23,199 --> 00:51:25,838
grand

1482
00:51:23,679 --> 00:51:27,919
and now you gotta spend 2500 bucks to

1483
00:51:25,838 --> 00:51:29,838
make it work right come on

1484
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:32,079
all right that's kind of it and then and

1485
00:51:29,838 --> 00:51:33,759
then if your harvest ride breaks

1486
00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:35,440
you shit out of luck you basically

1487
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:37,440
bought a boat anchor if you can't fix it

1488
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:40,720
yourself

1489
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:42,800
yeah that's true no i'm serious i got

1490
00:51:40,719 --> 00:51:45,279
i got a guy from canada sent me a deal

1491
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:46,720
today three out of five of the brand new

1492
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:50,000
ones they got in

1493
00:51:46,719 --> 00:51:52,318
right the shelves in there weren't even

1494
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,599
riveted on one side and like two of the

1495
00:51:52,318 --> 00:51:56,880
shelves were just at a

1496
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:57,280
total angle right and that was our brand

1497
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:59,200
new

1498
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:00,640
unpackaged getting ready to go out to a

1499
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:04,960
customer

1500
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:04,960
three out of five so we got two

1501
00:52:06,318 --> 00:52:09,759
but like that's just what you can see

1502
00:52:08,318 --> 00:52:12,159
visibly

1503
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:12,800
can you imagine what could go wrong

1504
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:15,440
under there

1505
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:17,839
and i i'm not you know don't get me

1506
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:19,440
wrong i get no money from nobody that

1507
00:52:17,838 --> 00:52:21,199
makes these other than categories i

1508
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:22,240
worked with them but that's a very large

1509
00:52:21,199 --> 00:52:23,838
machine

1510
00:52:22,239 --> 00:52:25,039
i mean we're talking hundred grand and

1511
00:52:23,838 --> 00:52:26,480
stuff like that you know the little

1512
00:52:25,039 --> 00:52:27,759
one's 30 grand

1513
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:29,599
okay those are the ones i told them to

1514
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:32,559
put on the shelves of stock

1515
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:34,400
but it's equal to three harvest rates in

1516
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:37,119
size and volume

1517
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:40,079
and it is a machine that will last you

1518
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:42,720
as long as you live until you die

1519
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:45,519
it's not like that how big is it

1520
00:52:42,719 --> 00:52:49,439
physically big is it well the the

1521
00:52:45,519 --> 00:52:51,759
size of the smallest unit is roughly

1522
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:52,480
about three not even quite four feet

1523
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:55,520
deep

1524
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:57,599
and maybe a little over two feet wide

1525
00:52:55,519 --> 00:52:59,199
maybe three feet tall wow you know

1526
00:52:57,599 --> 00:53:01,359
they're not extremely large well

1527
00:52:59,199 --> 00:53:02,960
it's on a cart so you got from the floor

1528
00:53:01,358 --> 00:53:05,920
up so yeah maybe it's

1529
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:06,880
four foot tall total right and two and a

1530
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:08,559
half wide

1531
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:11,200
and about three or four deep it's not

1532
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:13,359
that big no the right size is here

1533
00:53:11,199 --> 00:53:14,719
better and the key to that see those

1534
00:53:13,358 --> 00:53:19,838
that yeah

1535
00:53:14,719 --> 00:53:21,679
the key to that is its warming system

1536
00:53:19,838 --> 00:53:23,440
is not on individual strategies that's

1537
00:53:21,679 --> 00:53:25,358
why it takes longer

1538
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:27,280
but what it is is the machine is made

1539
00:53:25,358 --> 00:53:29,519
that way that's where

1540
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:31,359
a real smart guy he's been building

1541
00:53:29,519 --> 00:53:32,400
these things for 30 years he's working

1542
00:53:31,358 --> 00:53:33,759
for everybody

1543
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:34,960
and he's been to all the different

1544
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:36,480
countries where they make them the

1545
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:38,639
factories of mankind

1546
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:40,240
and that's why when he designed these

1547
00:53:38,639 --> 00:53:42,639
that he's selling now

1548
00:53:40,239 --> 00:53:44,239
he designed it himself and he's having a

1549
00:53:42,639 --> 00:53:45,679
built in the factory that he thinks is

1550
00:53:44,239 --> 00:53:47,199
the best in the world in england

1551
00:53:45,679 --> 00:53:48,558
and they're using all the best parts

1552
00:53:47,199 --> 00:53:49,279
that come mainly out of germany and

1553
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:50,720
england

1554
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:52,880
but they've been building them for over

1555
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:53,919
30 years right

1556
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:56,079
and they know what the hell they're

1557
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:57,599
doing so he said okay here's what i want

1558
00:53:56,079 --> 00:53:59,440
because the past few years i think

1559
00:53:57,599 --> 00:54:00,880
people were kind of pushing them around

1560
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:02,639
as to how they wanted it

1561
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:04,079
rather than how the machine really works

1562
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:06,960
it's like everything you can't

1563
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:08,800
turn a barber's gear you know into a

1564
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:11,358
sheepshear they just don't work the same

1565
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:12,880
right you know you can't make a ferrari

1566
00:54:11,358 --> 00:54:14,480
out of a volkswagen i don't care how

1567
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:17,519
many volkswagen parts you bring me

1568
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:19,519
i can't make a ferrari right so it's the

1569
00:54:17,519 --> 00:54:21,119
same kind of a thing you've got to

1570
00:54:19,519 --> 00:54:22,559
understand the parts so they're making

1571
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:24,800
the best stuff and

1572
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:27,280
there's a warranty you get service you

1573
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:29,200
got a problem bang it's fixed

1574
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:30,640
right that's the big difference there

1575
00:54:29,199 --> 00:54:31,279
too because that's one thing with

1576
00:54:30,639 --> 00:54:32,960
harvest

1577
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:35,040
it really it's been for years that way i

1578
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:37,599
mean i'm not speaking out of school

1579
00:54:35,039 --> 00:54:39,039
i don't think you can find anybody that

1580
00:54:37,599 --> 00:54:39,599
hardly that hasn't had a problem with

1581
00:54:39,039 --> 00:54:41,119
them if they

1582
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:43,280
had a breakage with their machine or

1583
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:46,480
something go wrong you know what i mean

1584
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:49,680
knock on wood man i know yeah true

1585
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:50,719
i i seriously i i feel i feel for the

1586
00:54:49,679 --> 00:54:53,199
people because

1587
00:54:50,719 --> 00:54:54,078
i say this guy up in canada he ordered

1588
00:54:53,199 --> 00:54:55,679
five

1589
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:57,519
brought in five and only two of them he

1590
00:54:55,679 --> 00:54:58,159
can sell the other three now he's got to

1591
00:54:57,519 --> 00:55:02,079
return

1592
00:54:58,159 --> 00:55:07,039
back to china right i mean come on

1593
00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:07,039
and he's a dealer yeah he's a dealer

1594
00:55:11,199 --> 00:55:14,879
and they work okay fine for bubble hash

1595
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:16,559
to be honest

1596
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:18,880
i say that's why i tell people you know

1597
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:20,079
for the money and the fact that what

1598
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:22,240
they are

1599
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:23,519
if you're starting out now then yeah

1600
00:55:22,239 --> 00:55:24,719
that's probably your best step

1601
00:55:23,519 --> 00:55:26,239
because you're just supplementing the

1602
00:55:24,719 --> 00:55:27,039
water away you're not pulling it through

1603
00:55:26,239 --> 00:55:28,078
the cells

1604
00:55:27,039 --> 00:55:30,880
you're not pulling it out of the

1605
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:32,839
trichome so it's a simple operation

1606
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:34,000
so it functions you know what i mean it

1607
00:55:32,838 --> 00:55:35,759
works

1608
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,119
but you know the trouble is is you're

1609
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:38,559
flipping the dice

1610
00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:40,318
whether you're going to get a bad one a

1611
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:41,920
good one hopefully yours lasts

1612
00:55:40,318 --> 00:55:44,480
forever you know what i mean but you

1613
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:46,480
never know and i've seen too many of

1614
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:48,559
them fail when you say this guy today

1615
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:50,240
well yeah it was funny it was yesterday

1616
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:51,920
it was like we were talking about it two

1617
00:55:50,239 --> 00:55:53,919
days before because he wanted me to do a

1618
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:54,798
zoom up there in canada with him doing a

1619
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:56,639
show

1620
00:55:54,798 --> 00:55:58,960
and you know we were talking and we were

1621
00:55:56,639 --> 00:56:00,960
talking about this very thing

1622
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:03,280
and it's it's sad because there's not

1623
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:05,358
something to the leather cover

1624
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:07,359
is probably the best in betweener right

1625
00:56:05,358 --> 00:56:10,798
now the factor that you can

1626
00:56:07,358 --> 00:56:11,759
buy one for roughly 20 000 okay and it's

1627
00:56:10,798 --> 00:56:14,798
roughly

1628
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:16,799
three harvest right okay when you get to

1629
00:56:14,798 --> 00:56:19,838
that volume that's okay

1630
00:56:16,798 --> 00:56:22,960
right then it's equal money more or less

1631
00:56:19,838 --> 00:56:25,759
right so then you can also that with

1632
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:26,318
one vacuum pump then buy another machine

1633
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:29,040
for

1634
00:56:26,318 --> 00:56:31,039
it's like 13 grand if you buy just the

1635
00:56:29,039 --> 00:56:33,279
machine parts without the vacuum pump

1636
00:56:31,039 --> 00:56:34,639
and you can hook two two machines up to

1637
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:35,920
one vacuum pump

1638
00:56:34,639 --> 00:56:38,000
so you can save a little bit there and

1639
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:40,798
double your volume

1640
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,199
right and operate that way but it's

1641
00:56:40,798 --> 00:56:43,039
still

1642
00:56:41,199 --> 00:56:44,960
you know it's all money now and i hate

1643
00:56:43,039 --> 00:56:45,838
to tell people but it's like the morax

1644
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:47,199
gonna pass

1645
00:56:45,838 --> 00:56:48,719
while it pass through congress it'll

1646
00:56:47,199 --> 00:56:49,598
it'll pass through this next year no

1647
00:56:48,719 --> 00:56:51,039
doubt

1648
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:52,318
the trouble is is that's when the

1649
00:56:51,039 --> 00:56:53,920
billionaires walk in not the

1650
00:56:52,318 --> 00:56:55,679
millionaires now kids

1651
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:57,358
because this is going to be hardball

1652
00:56:55,679 --> 00:56:59,279
because now the bankers can get in and

1653
00:56:57,358 --> 00:57:01,279
play and we can play stock market and we

1654
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:02,720
can play all kinds of fun games

1655
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:04,319
and it ain't going to be the junior

1656
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:06,159
league millionaires and it's going to be

1657
00:57:04,318 --> 00:57:10,000
the billionaires that come in and just

1658
00:57:06,159 --> 00:57:12,399
suck shit up i'm not going to like

1659
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:14,239
sucker fish on the bottom man it's

1660
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:15,680
already happened i mean

1661
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:17,838
look at all the companies that have sold

1662
00:57:15,679 --> 00:57:18,879
out already general hydroponics should

1663
00:57:17,838 --> 00:57:21,119
they sell out too

1664
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:23,119
all right that was that toro who's

1665
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:25,200
general hydroponics

1666
00:57:23,119 --> 00:57:26,400
right i mean you know you tell me it's

1667
00:57:25,199 --> 00:57:27,598
just going to be that way they're going

1668
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:29,760
to keep eating it up the

1669
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:31,280
thing that people got to really watch

1670
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:33,119
seriously for you guys

1671
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:34,559
is the local laws like right now they're

1672
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:36,000
trying to make it so

1673
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:37,839
if you're say a patient you got a

1674
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:39,358
medical card right well

1675
00:57:37,838 --> 00:57:40,558
you're sick and you want to make rso

1676
00:57:39,358 --> 00:57:42,000
because you got cancer or something

1677
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:43,760
right you're making an rso for your

1678
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,199
patient or yourself

1679
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:47,760
they're making it illegal to do that in

1680
00:57:45,199 --> 00:57:50,960
your home kitchen

1681
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:53,520
damn it's in the law read it

1682
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:54,159
in cali even people got to wake up and

1683
00:57:53,519 --> 00:57:55,679
not just

1684
00:57:54,159 --> 00:57:57,519
i think that the guy over there with the

1685
00:57:55,679 --> 00:57:59,919
politicians doing it for us

1686
00:57:57,519 --> 00:58:01,759
because they're not dude look around

1687
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:03,760
who's paying all these taxes and they're

1688
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:04,799
they're they're squeezing everyone out

1689
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:06,240
of the middle

1690
00:58:04,798 --> 00:58:08,239
there's going to be you might be able to

1691
00:58:06,239 --> 00:58:09,679
grow a couple plants at home later

1692
00:58:08,239 --> 00:58:11,039
and then the corporate you're gonna have

1693
00:58:09,679 --> 00:58:12,480
to buy everything they want you to buy

1694
00:58:11,039 --> 00:58:13,759
everything so they get their taxes

1695
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:15,519
period

1696
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:16,880
i'm sorry that's life that's it's the

1697
00:58:15,519 --> 00:58:18,559
way reality is

1698
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:20,000
and now they're trying to squeeze out

1699
00:58:18,559 --> 00:58:22,400
the middle

1700
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:23,519
and if people don't keep fighting you

1701
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:26,639
know how did this all

1702
00:58:23,519 --> 00:58:28,960
start how did how did marijuana become

1703
00:58:26,639 --> 00:58:32,639
medically legal in california how

1704
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:35,280
how long ago and why was it

1705
00:58:32,639 --> 00:58:36,480
cancer patients and aid patients in san

1706
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:39,200
francisco

1707
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:40,639
we're dying and it was found to be a

1708
00:58:39,199 --> 00:58:42,558
remedy for things like

1709
00:58:40,639 --> 00:58:46,000
gee you're getting chemo hey smoke some

1710
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:47,599
weed you'll get hungry and it worked

1711
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:49,440
so we we're riding on the backs of

1712
00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:50,480
medical patients here but yet

1713
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:52,079
everybody's you know letting the

1714
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:52,880
corporate thing just fly off it's the

1715
00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:54,798
old

1716
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:56,160
and it's like the bhl and everything

1717
00:58:54,798 --> 00:58:57,679
else i say the same thing that was in

1718
00:58:56,159 --> 00:58:59,519
the pharmaceutical industry

1719
00:58:57,679 --> 00:59:01,358
stepped into this industry and put their

1720
00:58:59,519 --> 00:59:02,960
foot in it just like they did

1721
00:59:01,358 --> 00:59:04,719
the pharmaceutical industry that

1722
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:07,199
corporate oil industry

1723
00:59:04,719 --> 00:59:08,719
kept petrochemical industry went into

1724
00:59:07,199 --> 00:59:10,639
the pharmaceutical market and took it

1725
00:59:08,719 --> 00:59:12,480
over we can make sulfur we can make this

1726
00:59:10,639 --> 00:59:14,318
we can make that we just mix it together

1727
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:17,358
and hey there you go

1728
00:59:14,318 --> 00:59:20,239
all right we're not on homeopathic

1729
00:59:17,358 --> 00:59:22,400
medicine or organic medicine no no no

1730
00:59:20,239 --> 00:59:24,798
we're we're making it by the barrel full

1731
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:27,440
over here out of synthetic shit

1732
00:59:24,798 --> 00:59:29,358
right now what did they do with bho and

1733
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:29,679
and propane and all these other things

1734
00:59:29,358 --> 00:59:31,440
now

1735
00:59:29,679 --> 00:59:33,199
alcohol is alcohol we've been doing that

1736
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:36,318
for hundreds of years but

1737
00:59:33,199 --> 00:59:38,000
you know all of those processes sure

1738
00:59:36,318 --> 00:59:39,838
they they're very functional because

1739
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,400
you're liquefying the trichomes they

1740
00:59:39,838 --> 00:59:44,078
have to

1741
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:46,639
all come because they just got liquefied

1742
00:59:44,079 --> 00:59:47,839
right in butane so now we've sucked all

1743
00:59:46,639 --> 00:59:49,279
them off and now we're going to bring

1744
00:59:47,838 --> 00:59:50,880
them back and we just hope we can get

1745
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:52,798
all the butane out

1746
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:54,559
now granted we test all that stuff here

1747
00:59:52,798 --> 00:59:56,480
but you know in reality

1748
00:59:54,559 --> 00:59:58,319
you can do anything solventless that you

1749
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:59,199
could do with butane propane and all the

1750
00:59:58,318 --> 01:00:00,880
rest of them

1751
00:59:59,199 --> 01:00:03,358
they just didn't believe it back then

1752
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:06,559
because they didn't know how

1753
01:00:03,358 --> 01:00:11,119
they did not know how it was like making

1754
01:00:06,559 --> 01:00:13,920
diamonds you know making diamonds

1755
01:00:11,119 --> 01:00:15,920
it's almost hilarious because there's

1756
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:18,079
people doing that and people go oh no no

1757
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:19,358
shatters shatters it man you guys got to

1758
01:00:18,079 --> 01:00:21,760

1760
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:25,040

1766
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:37,358
and it's now i like to tell people when

1767
01:00:35,119 --> 01:00:38,798
you start a bsu or propane operation

1768
01:00:37,358 --> 01:00:41,279
like that

1769
01:00:38,798 --> 01:00:42,079
you know you're gonna literally need at

1770
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:45,040
least a million

1771
01:00:42,079 --> 01:00:47,119
dollars right out the gate just for the

1772
01:00:45,039 --> 01:00:48,639
building permits and the bullshit

1773
01:00:47,119 --> 01:00:51,039
then you get to buy the equipment all

1774
01:00:48,639 --> 01:00:52,719
the rest the crap for the next million

1775
01:00:51,039 --> 01:00:54,798
okay well all those guys got all that

1776
01:00:52,719 --> 01:00:56,639
money invested in all those buildings

1777
01:00:54,798 --> 01:00:58,159
and everything else that they did

1778
01:00:56,639 --> 01:00:59,519
and they got to pay it back they got to

1779
01:00:58,159 --> 01:01:01,199
pay for it they didn't buy it all with

1780
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:03,920
cash they bought they took loans and

1781
01:01:01,199 --> 01:01:06,719
everybody else did whatever they did

1782
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:08,000
and sure enough you know now they've got

1783

you don't have to clean it at all you

1878
01:04:22,798 --> 01:04:26,480
don't have to stop the machine every

1879
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:28,079
four hours and pour a special solution

1880
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:29,599
in and run it through to clean it every

1881
01:04:28,079 --> 01:04:31,200
five for five minutes

1882
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:33,680
and then once a year send it back to the

1883
01:04:31,199 --> 01:04:35,838
factory hell no the south korean one

1884
01:04:33,679 --> 01:04:37,519
they come up with the new technology and

1885
01:04:35,838 --> 01:04:38,480
alter the frequencies and they bounce it

1886
01:04:37,519 --> 01:04:39,679
off the plates

1887
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:41,679
and they keep the place from ever

1888
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:43,358
growing anything on them so they sell

1889
01:04:41,679 --> 01:04:44,629
clean so you never have to shut it off

1890
01:04:43,358 --> 01:04:46,400
and it runs forever

1891
01:04:44,630 --> 01:04:49,440
[Music]

1892
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:50,720
which one would you buy right and that's

1893
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:52,798
the point like

1894
01:04:50,719 --> 01:04:54,000
you know that oh you you must be working

1895

using foul language i've never used that

1900
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:06,078
then all of a sudden here comes her

1901
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:08,480
husband now he's saying hey what are you

1902

01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:12,318
predator

1904
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:12,720
she's at home trying to school her kids

a predator then i'm sorry but that's the

1912
01:05:26,559 --> 01:05:30,000
trouble with this social media

1913
01:05:28,079 --> 01:05:32,160
you guys get all burned up and then you

1914
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:34,159
start using foul language because you

1915
01:05:32,159 --> 01:05:35,598
you believe everything's free over here

1916

nobody's going to know who you are or

1917
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:38,880
whatever

1918
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:40,798

1921
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:46,079
right yeah which i don't do i never do

1922
01:05:44,159 --> 01:05:47,358
on any social media and people that not

1923
01:05:46,079 --> 01:05:48,880

1924
01:05:47,358 --> 01:05:50,400
no i'll tell you hey look go check the

1925
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:52,079
facts

1926

so that's when she started doing that i

1927
01:05:52,079 --> 01:05:54,240
said well held it i went online and yeah

1928
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:55,520
hey

1929
01:05:54,239 --> 01:05:56,959
you guys want to know where hydrogen

1930

1931
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:58,880

1932
01:05:58,079 --> 01:06:00,640

01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:02,079
check the difference check the specs

1934
01:06:00,639 --> 01:06:04,480
check the models

1935
01:06:02,079 --> 01:06:05,839
check the service check everything you

1936
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:07,920
decide

1937
01:06:05,838 --> 01:06:09,599
i never tell people you know unless i

1938
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:11,519
gotta have a paying client

1939
01:06:09,599 --> 01:06:13,200
i don't tell them what to buy exactly or

1940
01:06:11,519 --> 01:06:15,199
you know give them my opinions because

1941
01:06:13,199 --> 01:06:17,038
bottom line there's too many variables

1942
01:06:15,199 --> 01:06:19,038
but when you're telling people you're

1943
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:21,599
the only one in the world that does this

1944
01:06:19,039 --> 01:06:23,839
and makes that and there's two companies

1945
01:06:21,599 --> 01:06:24,880
i sent her two links

1946
01:06:23,838 --> 01:06:26,719
there's two companies that make the

1947
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:28,000
exact same product one of them's

1948
01:06:26,719 --> 01:06:29,439
identical to theirs

1949
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,798
and the other one just makes the

1950
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:31,440
cleaning there's actually it was really

1951
01:06:30,798 --> 01:06:33,599
cool just

1952
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:35,838
be good thinking covered and all that

1953
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:37,519
right now right got to clean things

1954
01:06:35,838 --> 01:06:38,960
so this comes as like a spray bottle

1955
01:06:37,519 --> 01:06:42,000
kind of like one of those

1956
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:44,079
409 bottles right and it's got a little

1957
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:46,639
base on it electronic you plug it in

1958
01:06:44,079 --> 01:06:48,798
where you put you put water in you put

1959
01:06:46,639 --> 01:06:50,000
salt in like two teaspoons of salt

1960
01:06:48,798 --> 01:06:51,679
and then you got a little squirter of

1961
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,480
vinegar you squirt a little vinegar in

1962
01:06:51,679 --> 01:06:54,639
and it's even

1963
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:57,519
stronger and a better sterilizer and

1964
01:06:54,639 --> 01:06:59,598
cleaner than the keg in 2.5

1965
01:06:57,519 --> 01:07:00,559
because you don't add vinegar to it but

1966
01:06:59,599 --> 01:07:01,838
that when

1967
01:07:00,559 --> 01:07:03,760
it comes out you put it on this little

1968
01:07:01,838 --> 01:07:05,838
stand in like 30 minutes

1969
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:07,520
it makes that container sterile water to

1970
01:07:05,838 --> 01:07:09,679
use anywhere in your you know

1971
01:07:07,519 --> 01:07:12,318
house whatever on your hands your

1972
01:07:09,679 --> 01:07:15,038
surfaces clean whatever you want

1973
01:07:12,318 --> 01:07:17,519
right so it's a home cleaner so you

1974
01:07:15,039 --> 01:07:20,319
never buy 409 or

1975
01:07:17,519 --> 01:07:21,679
oven cleaner or whatever again just buy

1976
01:07:20,318 --> 01:07:23,199
one of those put it on the

1977
01:07:21,679 --> 01:07:25,759
sink with this little stand and it's

1978
01:07:23,199 --> 01:07:29,838
plugged in and ready to go all the time

1979
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:33,119
i gotta cool this out catalog

1980
01:07:29,838 --> 01:07:37,838
i'm sorry i gotta see the tim catalog

1981
01:07:33,119 --> 01:07:37,838
i'm curious what the the washing machine

1982
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:42,400
no it's like anything i you know don't

1983
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:44,000
get me wrong it's

1984
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:45,760
there's too much information out there

1985
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:47,440
and i've traveled the world i use those

1986
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:49,119
machines over in asia

1987
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:51,039
and i knew there was a couple of

1988
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:51,280
different makers there's there's always

1989
01:07:51,039 --> 01:07:55,200
an

1990
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:56,079
asian maker at least part of asia the

1991
01:07:55,199 --> 01:07:57,598
thing is

1992
01:07:56,079 --> 01:07:59,519
like when you go to where they sell

1993
01:07:57,599 --> 01:08:02,160
motorcycles

1994
01:07:59,519 --> 01:08:02,880
there's at least three of them and in

1995
01:08:02,159 --> 01:08:04,719
within a

1996
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:06,000
throw a stone's throw of each other they

1997
01:08:04,719 --> 01:08:07,919
always do that

1998
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:09,039
if there's a guy with a tire shop next

1999
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:11,119
you know two stores down it'll be

2000
01:08:09,039 --> 01:08:12,720
another tire shop

2001
01:08:11,119 --> 01:08:14,400
that's just the way it is they group

2002
01:08:12,719 --> 01:08:15,358
together i don't know why i don't know

2003
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:17,920
why it's

2004
01:08:15,358 --> 01:08:19,278
the way it is but it seems like in asia

2005
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:20,798
it's the same way if somebody's making

2006
01:08:19,279 --> 01:08:22,480
something and it's working and it's good

2007
01:08:20,798 --> 01:08:24,479
hey we can make that too and they start

2008
01:08:22,479 --> 01:08:26,000
making it too now like i say these guys

2009
01:08:24,479 --> 01:08:27,759
that are making these have been doing it

2010
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:29,359
over 30 40 years so

2011
01:08:27,759 --> 01:08:31,039
they're as good as the guys in italy i

2012
01:08:29,359 --> 01:08:32,400
mean i trust them

2013
01:08:31,039 --> 01:08:34,000
they got a warranty and everything and

2014
01:08:32,399 --> 01:08:35,679
they're good for it they got it actually

2015
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:37,439
in operation in la

2016
01:08:35,679 --> 01:08:39,520

2017

2018
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:42,960

2019
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:46,079

area that's your area to sell right and

2028
01:09:01,759 --> 01:09:05,119

2029
01:09:03,119 --> 01:09:08,158
in that area or the content

2030

2043

don't use foul language never have

2052
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:52,960
wouldn't do it right but the bottom line

2053
01:09:52,238 --> 01:09:55,039
is

2054
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:56,158
though these people are insulted that i

2055
01:09:55,039 --> 01:09:58,238
busted them

2056
01:09:56,158 --> 01:09:59,839
okay they're insulted because they

2057
01:09:58,238 --> 01:10:01,359
couldn't refute the facts

2058
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:03,119
they just kept coming up with other

2059
01:10:01,359 --> 01:10:03,679
excuses that i'm an asshole or i'm a

2060
01:10:03,119 --> 01:10:06,800
this or

2061
01:10:03,679 --> 01:10:09,279
there's that or oh it's an iso standard

2062
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:10,320
well an iso standard yeah i'm a i'm a

2063
01:10:09,279 --> 01:10:13,198
sigma

2064
01:10:10,319 --> 01:10:14,719
sigma black belt okay six sigma black

2065
01:10:13,198 --> 01:10:16,879
belt you teach iso

2066
01:10:14,719 --> 01:10:17,840
i trained iso in africa i know what an

2067
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:20,400
iso

2068
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:21,760
certification is it's a quality control

2069
01:10:20,399 --> 01:10:24,079
certification

2070
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:25,679
for the manufacture of the equipment it

2071
01:10:24,079 --> 01:10:27,760
has nothing to do with comparing that

2072
01:10:25,679 --> 01:10:30,319
thing to anything else

2073
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:31,280
okay ul labs you see the ul labs stamp

2074
01:10:30,319 --> 01:10:33,119
on shit right

2075
01:10:31,279 --> 01:10:35,439
i've had my products go through ul labs

2076
01:10:33,119 --> 01:10:37,679
you know what ul labs does

2077
01:10:35,439 --> 01:10:39,678
the ul labs takes whatever you say the

2078
01:10:37,679 --> 01:10:42,319
machine or whatever the part will do

2079
01:10:39,679 --> 01:10:43,760
whatever it is it'll take this much heat

2080
01:10:42,319 --> 01:10:46,319
it'll last this long

2081
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:47,840
it'll wear this much it'll take this

2082
01:10:46,319 --> 01:10:49,599
kind of heat it'll taste this guy

2083
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:52,560
whatever it is you say

2084
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:53,520
they test it and if it does what you

2085
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:56,800
said it would

2086
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:58,560
you all snap no problem there's no

2087
01:10:56,800 --> 01:11:01,119
comparison of products

2088
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:02,880
so you can't just say oh well you know

2089
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:04,000
this one's better because it has a stamp

2090
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:06,000
on it

2091
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:07,679
well maybe it is maybe it isn't maybe it

2092
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:09,119
makes it safe maybe it makes it so

2093
01:11:07,679 --> 01:11:10,880
everything they said is true

2094
01:11:09,119 --> 01:11:12,399
so if they take everything they said is

2095
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:13,840
true and i compare it to the other stuff

2096
01:11:12,399 --> 01:11:15,359
over there that's all true

2097
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:17,840
and they're both once better than the

2098
01:11:15,359 --> 01:11:20,960
other then i can choose right

2099
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:20,960
no problem i got it

2100
01:11:21,039 --> 01:11:26,960
so anyway it's just kind of hilarious i

2101
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:26,960
like the way things go

2102
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:32,640
on me and get him to tell me to stop

2103
01:11:34,079 --> 01:11:37,920
that's crazy that's really kind of what

2104
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:39,920
my friend said that's

2105
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:41,440
kind of what sean said in colorado he

2106
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:42,960
kind of laughed he goes well you do what

2107
01:11:41,439 --> 01:11:44,719
you need to do he says uh

2108
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:46,560
you know some of your silo looking

2109
01:11:44,719 --> 01:11:48,239

2110
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:50,239

2112
01:11:50,238 --> 01:11:53,279
they sent me and you see who said what

2113
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:55,760
and who did what

2114
01:11:53,279 --> 01:11:57,119

2115
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:58,719

2116
01:11:57,119 --> 01:12:00,479
i don't deal with bullshit here you go

2117
01:11:58,719 --> 01:12:02,319
this is what i said please check these

2118
01:12:00,479 --> 01:12:04,959
facts check the specifications

2119
01:12:02,319 --> 01:12:06,880
check this company check that company is

2120
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:08,319
that being rooted obnoxious i don't

2121
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:10,319
think so i think it's like

2122
01:12:08,319 --> 01:12:11,840
hey i'm trying to prove a point that

2123
01:12:10,319 --> 01:12:12,559
maybe you need to change your verbiage

2124
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:15,520
to say

2125
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:16,800
we're one of the companies in the world

2126
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:20,960
that can make this

2127
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:22,719
how's that that's being stupid

2128
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:24,480
but i knew as well as you know they

2129
01:12:22,719 --> 01:12:26,560
wouldn't say that they wanted to believe

2130
01:12:24,479 --> 01:12:28,479
because they're in their little cult but

2131
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:30,480
if you name the water something else it

2132
01:12:28,479 --> 01:12:30,959
becomes something else no it's alkaline

2133
01:12:30,479 --> 01:12:34,000
water

2134
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:38,239
that's all it is it's alkaline water

2135
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:40,960
sorry engine water the cans and water

2136
01:12:38,238 --> 01:12:43,279
it's the kangen water right what was it

2137
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:46,079
the candy water

2138
01:12:43,279 --> 01:12:47,039
yeah i'm sorry but you know that kagan

2139
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:48,479
thinks that

2140
01:12:47,039 --> 01:12:50,800
they came up with you know we call it

2141
01:12:48,479 --> 01:12:53,359
pagan and if we call it kagan then

2142
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:55,199
that means it's special okay but it's

2143
01:12:53,359 --> 01:12:57,599
really just alkaline water

2144
01:12:55,198 --> 01:12:58,960
well but it's kagan well but it's just

2145
01:12:57,600 --> 01:13:00,960
alkaline water

2146
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:02,480
but how do you get into the alkalinity

2147
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:02,800
you can get a lot of different ways i

2148
01:13:02,479 --> 01:13:06,158
think

2149
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:08,239
i guess it's got to have some well

2150
01:13:06,158 --> 01:13:09,599
when you get down you get 2.5 you have

2151
01:13:08,238 --> 01:13:11,439
to add salt to it or

2152
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:13,360
you would have to have some salt water

2153
01:13:11,439 --> 01:13:15,039
in your water when it makes it because

2154
01:13:13,359 --> 01:13:17,119
it goes through an electroplating

2155
01:13:15,039 --> 01:13:19,039
and the electroplates then alter the ph

2156
01:13:17,119 --> 01:13:20,719
of the water down to two five

2157
01:13:19,039 --> 01:13:23,119
but you need a lot of salt in the in the

2158
01:13:20,719 --> 01:13:25,679
water and it needs to be fairly cool too

2159
01:13:23,119 --> 01:13:26,960
colder than better actually but again on

2160
01:13:25,679 --> 01:13:28,640
the other side

2161
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:30,640
when you go to the high side you know if

2162
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:33,280
you're going acid or you're going

2163
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:34,400
you know unsalty so you can use them for

2164
01:13:33,279 --> 01:13:36,800
different things but you can

2165
01:13:34,399 --> 01:13:38,000
you can be drinking up in the eight

2166
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:40,320
nines

2167
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:42,238
right alkalinity because an alkaline

2168
01:13:40,319 --> 01:13:44,000
body cannot grow cancer

2169
01:13:42,238 --> 01:13:45,439
cancer cannot grow in an alkaline

2170
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:48,880
environment period won't

2171
01:13:45,439 --> 01:13:48,879
can't that's why fish don't have it

2172
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:53,679
at least ocean fish what other kind of

2173
01:13:52,479 --> 01:13:55,599
things

2174
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:57,440
you know an alkaline environment kills

2175
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:58,960
itself bottom line you should be

2176
01:13:57,439 --> 01:14:00,479
drinking a higher ph

2177
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:02,640
but then again for cleaning you want a

2178
01:14:00,479 --> 01:14:04,639
lower ph and of course for your plants

2179
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:08,239
you want something in the middle there

2180
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:11,440
hey tim i get a lot of dms

2181
01:14:08,238 --> 01:14:12,718
asking me about the ph in hash and they

2182
01:14:11,439 --> 01:14:16,319
ask me if i've noticed

2183
01:14:12,719 --> 01:14:18,960
hash in different phs and

2184
01:14:16,319 --> 01:14:18,960
talking with you

2185
01:14:21,279 --> 01:14:26,399
what was that i said if you want to

2186
01:14:23,679 --> 01:14:28,158
waste it tested it go ahead

2187
01:14:26,399 --> 01:14:30,479
that's my thought on it don't get me

2188
01:14:28,158 --> 01:14:31,439
wrong but first off you'd have to figure

2189
01:14:30,479 --> 01:14:35,119
out how to

2190
01:14:31,439 --> 01:14:36,719
test the ph in the rosin or in the oil

2191
01:14:35,119 --> 01:14:38,158
itself so that way you'd have to at

2192
01:14:36,719 --> 01:14:39,600
least get it melted and out of the

2193
01:14:38,158 --> 01:14:42,479
trichome right

2194
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:42,800
and then you'd have to actually decarb

2195
01:14:42,479 --> 01:14:44,879
it

2196
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:46,719
to get it to be the effect of when

2197
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:47,920
you're actually in taking it when you're

2198
01:14:46,719 --> 01:14:50,000
inhaling it doing a

2199
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:51,279
nail or whatever right okay it has to be

2200
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,640
decarb at that point

2201
01:14:51,279 --> 01:14:55,039
so that's where you need to take the

2202
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:57,440
test right

2203
01:14:55,039 --> 01:14:59,279
not the water itself actually that

2204
01:14:57,439 --> 01:15:01,198
you're washing the material in

2205
01:14:59,279 --> 01:15:03,759
well no no well when you're washing in

2206
01:15:01,198 --> 01:15:06,000
the water oh the water you yeah okay you

2207
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:07,280
wash water excuse me wash water should

2208
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:09,359
be somewhere in the neutrals

2209
01:15:07,279 --> 01:15:11,039
as i would say and what you can do

2210
01:15:09,359 --> 01:15:12,319
though is you see there's some tricks

2211
01:15:11,039 --> 01:15:14,158
you can play with water

2212
01:15:12,319 --> 01:15:15,519
if you over oxygenate water you're gonna

2213
01:15:14,158 --> 01:15:17,839
become an oxidizer

2214
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:18,880
in other words it'll eat bio material so

2215
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:21,199
you want to eat out that

2216
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:22,000
microscopic bile material you have that

2217
01:15:21,198 --> 01:15:23,599
everybody has

2218
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:25,198
because it's almost impossible to wash

2219
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:27,199
away well guess what

2220
01:15:25,198 --> 01:15:28,479
i've got a water that actually eats that

2221
01:15:27,198 --> 01:15:29,198
shit and takes it away it doesn't hurt

2222
01:15:28,479 --> 01:15:32,238
the trichome

2223
01:15:29,198 --> 01:15:33,759
or the trouble a little bit

2224
01:15:32,238 --> 01:15:35,279
yeah there's different ways to do that

2225
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:36,159
i've actually got a test running right

2226
01:15:35,279 --> 01:15:38,000
now

2227
01:15:36,158 --> 01:15:39,519
where we're just using oxygen because i

2228
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:42,079
found that

2229
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:43,120
a lot of through the testing i was doing

2230
01:15:42,079 --> 01:15:45,840
that uh

2231
01:15:43,119 --> 01:15:47,198
i was able to take away a lot of the the

2232
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:50,560
negative things that the

2233
01:15:47,198 --> 01:15:52,399
arsenics or borons of whatever it may be

2234
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:53,679
up to some of them leads in that are the

2235
01:15:52,399 --> 01:15:55,759
toughest but uh

2236
01:15:53,679 --> 01:15:58,000
i was able to to remove them with just

2237
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:59,360
oxygen over oxygenated water

2238
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,719
you have to get up in the really high

2239
01:15:59,359 --> 01:16:02,960
percentages though you got to get up

2240
01:16:00,719 --> 01:16:04,960
into 200 percent of normal and better

2241
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:06,158
right there's ways to do that that

2242
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:07,359
aren't that expensive

2243
01:16:06,158 --> 01:16:09,039
and then there's ways to do that are

2244
01:16:07,359 --> 01:16:09,759
very expensive depending on your volume

2245
01:16:09,039 --> 01:16:13,359
period

2246
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:15,920
it's it's all a relative so that's why i

2247
01:16:13,359 --> 01:16:19,279
offer that go to grow now because

2248
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:22,800
it's actually an electronic air

2249
01:16:19,279 --> 01:16:23,198
oxygen or water oxygenator this is not

2250
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:26,079
really

2251
01:16:23,198 --> 01:16:27,119
just like a bubbler okay what it does is

2252
01:16:26,079 --> 01:16:29,519
actually have two

2253
01:16:27,119 --> 01:16:30,479
plates once again they use electrostatic

2254
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:33,040
ions

2255
01:16:30,479 --> 01:16:35,759
so these plates are 25 millimeters or

2256
01:16:33,039 --> 01:16:38,479
microns apart microns apart excuse me

2257
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:39,679
and then what that causes is it causes

2258
01:16:38,479 --> 01:16:41,919
through the electrostatic

2259
01:16:39,679 --> 01:16:44,399
action of the electricity they actually

2260
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:47,760
split the molecule the h2o

2261
01:16:44,399 --> 01:16:49,279
the h which is a small one it breaks off

2262
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:52,159
easily and then it escapes through the

2263
01:16:49,279 --> 01:16:54,399
top of the tank it goes out of the water

2264
01:16:52,158 --> 01:16:55,839
the two oxygen molecules are now small

2265
01:16:54,399 --> 01:16:56,559
enough to then be absorbed into the

2266
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:57,840
water

2267
01:16:56,560 --> 01:17:00,640
so that's where you get a higher

2268
01:16:57,840 --> 01:17:01,840
dissolved oxygen content in your water

2269
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:04,480
and that's something that everybody

2270
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:06,400
should be testing and checking because

2271
01:17:04,479 --> 01:17:08,158
if you're using a well actually in the

2272
01:17:06,399 --> 01:17:10,000
country it can be very low

2273
01:17:08,158 --> 01:17:12,079
you could have very little oxygen in the

2274
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:13,840
in the actual water from a well

2275
01:17:12,079 --> 01:17:17,279
where in the study they a lot of times

2276
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:18,800
compare or they use very very large

2277
01:17:17,279 --> 01:17:20,800
alkaline systems like we're talking

2278
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:22,480
about here and when i'm talking about

2279
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:24,079
that we're talking about plates that are

2280
01:17:22,479 --> 01:17:26,000
the size of four by eight sheets of a

2281
01:17:24,079 --> 01:17:28,640
metal or a wood you know what i mean

2282
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:30,079
huge and they do like 5 000 gallons a

2283
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:32,480
minute kind of fucking pumping through

2284
01:17:30,079 --> 01:17:33,920
them right and they're just these giant

2285
01:17:32,479 --> 01:17:35,279
plates and what they're doing is once

2286
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:37,279
again they're

2287
01:17:35,279 --> 01:17:39,119
sending a they're changing it into a

2288
01:17:37,279 --> 01:17:42,399
hypochloric acid

2289
01:17:39,119 --> 01:17:43,198
the water you actually over ph it and

2290
01:17:42,399 --> 01:17:44,719
you

2291
01:17:43,198 --> 01:17:46,319
basically chlorinate it but you're not

2292
01:17:44,719 --> 01:17:48,640
chlorinating it with the salt

2293
01:17:46,319 --> 01:17:49,679
you're connecting it with hydrogen and

2294
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:52,480
oxygen so it's

2295
01:17:49,679 --> 01:17:53,920
hypochloric acid so then it's a

2296
01:17:52,479 --> 01:17:55,599
sterilizer it's a cleaner

2297
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:57,199
you can use clean surfaces clean

2298
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:59,039
yourself whatever

2299
01:17:57,198 --> 01:18:00,799
totally non-poisonous so you got to get

2300
01:17:59,039 --> 01:18:01,679
it way down it's got to be hypochloric

2301
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:04,079
to work

2302
01:18:01,679 --> 01:18:05,600
properly but you can do that and they

2303
01:18:04,079 --> 01:18:07,039
use that in the sewage business for

2304
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:07,920
doing sewage plants and that before

2305
01:18:07,039 --> 01:18:09,920
it'll exit

2306
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:11,440
out to the ocean and shit they'll have

2307
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:13,199
one of those giant machines i

2308
01:18:11,439 --> 01:18:14,960
saved these plates the size of freaking

2309
01:18:13,198 --> 01:18:16,479
48 sheets of plywood

2310
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:18,239
and they'll be running a shitload of

2311
01:18:16,479 --> 01:18:19,198
water through it from the from the

2312
01:18:18,238 --> 01:18:20,879
operation

2313
01:18:19,198 --> 01:18:22,639
and they force it into that exit pipe

2314
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:24,840
and then kind of sterilize the pipe and

2315
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:26,239
that last bit of the water that's going

2316
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:29,199
out

2317
01:18:26,238 --> 01:18:29,919
so you're saying to the the ph should be

2318
01:18:29,198 --> 01:18:32,719
neutral

2319
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:34,399
and also it needs to be oxygenated like

2320
01:18:32,719 --> 01:18:36,000
have oxygen

2321
01:18:34,399 --> 01:18:37,439
this is where i like to say there's no

2322
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:39,119
books on this that's why i've been doing

2323
01:18:37,439 --> 01:18:41,039
this shit for a couple years now

2324
01:18:39,119 --> 01:18:43,599
and i use ozone when we get up into

2325
01:18:41,039 --> 01:18:45,519
volumes and i used oxygen

2326
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:47,199
because i found that oxygen over using

2327
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:49,120
ozone and i had oxygen

2328
01:18:47,198 --> 01:18:50,879
i found that i could just use the oxygen

2329
01:18:49,119 --> 01:18:53,119
and get a certain effect now i'm

2330
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:54,640
working on to see if we can make enough

2331
01:18:53,119 --> 01:18:56,319
with these machines

2332
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:58,000
to make it functional so it's a

2333
01:18:56,319 --> 01:18:59,439
reasonable price it doesn't cost you an

2334
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:01,439
arm and a leg

2335
01:18:59,439 --> 01:19:03,359
to get that right because that's the

2336
01:19:01,439 --> 01:19:05,279
trouble with all this like my small

2337
01:19:03,359 --> 01:19:08,880
equipment for doing it

2338
01:19:05,279 --> 01:19:12,000
properly i guess i'd say that way is uh

2339
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:12,239
starts at 20 grand and goes up right and

2340
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,319
you

2341
01:19:12,238 --> 01:19:16,158
and it pulls water it's good for a 10

2342
01:19:14,319 --> 01:19:18,880
000 square foot indoor

2343
01:19:16,158 --> 01:19:20,238
or doing a water remediation right now

2344
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:20,719
we're working i'm working with all the

2345
01:19:20,238 --> 01:19:24,000
different

2346
01:19:20,719 --> 01:19:26,640
machine makers on remediating the

2347
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:28,319
waste water from from bubble hashing and

2348
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:29,199
returning the water back and filtering

2349
01:19:28,319 --> 01:19:31,359
out all the crap

2350
01:19:29,198 --> 01:19:33,039
as well as the terpenes some of the

2351
01:19:31,359 --> 01:19:34,319
companies want to recover the terpenes

2352
01:19:33,039 --> 01:19:35,760
and like i told them i don't want to i'm

2353
01:19:34,319 --> 01:19:37,119
not going there because then you've got

2354
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:39,360
to start using chemicals

2355
01:19:37,119 --> 01:19:40,158
there's just no two ways to do it out of

2356
01:19:39,359 --> 01:19:42,000
water

2357
01:19:40,158 --> 01:19:44,639
without using chemicals after it's in

2358
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:46,399
the water the terpenes become liquid

2359
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:49,280
because they'll actually the water will

2360
01:19:46,399 --> 01:19:50,799
go through the cell wall of turkey

2361
01:19:49,279 --> 01:19:52,238
you know i actually enter the trichome

2362
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:54,560
wall through the champion if you're not

2363
01:19:52,238 --> 01:19:54,559
careful

2364
01:19:55,279 --> 01:19:59,279
that's how you get that purple hash that

2365
01:19:56,880 --> 01:20:03,039
people post and like right

2366
01:19:59,279 --> 01:20:05,599
well actually i you know i uh

2367
01:20:03,039 --> 01:20:06,479
there's so many you know the the

2368
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:08,880
purpling

2369
01:20:06,479 --> 01:20:10,238
i mean back in doing this way too long

2370
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:12,319
but back in the day

2371
01:20:10,238 --> 01:20:13,599
no one really knew and then it made

2372
01:20:12,319 --> 01:20:15,519
sense that in the fall

2373
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:17,679
they changed color to attract insects to

2374
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:18,000
pollinate and that's really where that

2375
01:20:17,679 --> 01:20:19,920
gene

2376
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:22,079
comes from in the plant is they change

2377
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:23,840
color so they get that red spectrum

2378
01:20:22,079 --> 01:20:25,519
so that the different you know bees and

2379
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:27,440
different things see it more

2380
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:28,560
because they they attracted to red

2381
01:20:27,439 --> 01:20:30,960
spectrums right

2382
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:32,080
so connect to that line they they'll

2383
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:33,520
alter now

2384
01:20:32,079 --> 01:20:35,600
some of the strains are that way to keep

2385
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:37,440
them you know keeping bread

2386
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:39,199
basically to get insects to come by and

2387
01:20:37,439 --> 01:20:41,678
hopefully follow him

2388
01:20:39,198 --> 01:20:43,599
but i see it if you get into the some of

2389
01:20:41,679 --> 01:20:44,880
the microscopic shots of triathlons

2390
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:46,560
you'll notice that

2391
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:48,239
a lot of times it's the terpenes that

2392
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:50,560
are actually change the color

2393
01:20:48,238 --> 01:20:52,479
the actual trichome itself the actual

2394
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:53,600
resin in the trichome the stuff that

2395
01:20:52,479 --> 01:20:57,198
we're really

2396
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:59,440
dealing with more stuff inside the shell

2397
01:20:57,198 --> 01:21:00,799
right it doesn't have any color it's

2398
01:20:59,439 --> 01:21:02,799
clear as a bell

2399
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:04,639
yeah but it'll be the trichome leafs you

2400
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:07,679
know the daisy pattern on the bottom

2401
01:21:04,639 --> 01:21:08,880
of drag or turbine excuse me will have

2402
01:21:07,679 --> 01:21:10,319
turned purple

2403
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:12,560
and then you'll notice it starts to go

2404
01:21:10,319 --> 01:21:13,439
out because the i don't know french you

2405
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:15,280
agree too

2406
01:21:13,439 --> 01:21:16,479
you know and i i i think the same way

2407
01:21:15,279 --> 01:21:18,719
it's like

2408
01:21:16,479 --> 01:21:20,158
a human body you know we sweat poison

2409
01:21:18,719 --> 01:21:21,520
and pretty much the trichomes are

2410
01:21:20,158 --> 01:21:23,599
somewhat that they're

2411
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:26,320
the plant is putting off its poison

2412
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:28,880
which is arousing into that trichome

2413
01:21:26,319 --> 01:21:29,599
and you know there's a few day window

2414
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:32,719
there

2415
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:33,760
where it actually is it's ripest over

2416
01:21:32,719 --> 01:21:36,319
the whole plant

2417
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:37,119
on an average and catching that is tough

2418
01:21:36,319 --> 01:21:39,198
but

2419
01:21:37,119 --> 01:21:40,719
everybody likes to really clear stuff

2420
01:21:39,198 --> 01:21:42,479
now so everybody's picking it a little

2421
01:21:40,719 --> 01:21:43,439
early it seems too there's ways to play

2422
01:21:42,479 --> 01:21:44,799
that game and

2423
01:21:43,439 --> 01:21:46,479
a few of the big companies have been

2424
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:48,000
doing it forever you know they'll pull

2425
01:21:46,479 --> 01:21:50,238
it 35 days

2426
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:51,359
that kind of shit right there they're

2427
01:21:50,238 --> 01:21:55,519
just going for

2428
01:21:51,359 --> 01:21:57,439
you know the clear the white the color

2429
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:59,120
and you know to each his own everybody's

2430
01:21:57,439 --> 01:22:00,479
got their process

2431
01:21:59,119 --> 01:22:02,238
you know i'm not going to imagine they

2432
01:22:00,479 --> 01:22:05,439
have a pretty good production

2433
01:22:02,238 --> 01:22:07,198
35 days oh yeah

2434
01:22:05,439 --> 01:22:09,119
i mean you know it's like it's like

2435
01:22:07,198 --> 01:22:11,119
anything else depends on

2436
01:22:09,119 --> 01:22:12,800
every operation is different and that's

2437
01:22:11,119 --> 01:22:14,719
why like this one i'm going to go out

2438
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:15,920
there and work with them because

2439
01:22:14,719 --> 01:22:17,198
you know when you're setting up

2440
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:18,560
something like that it was one of those

2441
01:22:17,198 --> 01:22:22,000
where to be honest with you it was

2442
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:25,520
it was going to be soil pretty much

2443
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:27,840
until all the pieces and parts

2444
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:29,120
you know he already had gotten halfway

2445
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:30,960
there per se

2446
01:22:29,119 --> 01:22:33,198
and when i looked at what he had i said

2447
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:34,960
look you know you've spent

2448
01:22:33,198 --> 01:22:36,559
you're going to spend a small fortune

2449
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:38,239
here and what you're doing

2450
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:40,719
and i know you've already done half of

2451
01:22:38,238 --> 01:22:42,399
that and you're going to make this a

2452
01:22:40,719 --> 01:22:44,000
sterile environment

2453
01:22:42,399 --> 01:22:45,839
and then you're going to bring dirt in

2454
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:47,439
and we're going to have to allow bugs to

2455
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:49,039
do certain things right

2456
01:22:47,439 --> 01:22:50,638
because they're going to be there we

2457
01:22:49,039 --> 01:22:51,359
can't kill them off and have a living

2458
01:22:50,639 --> 01:22:54,800
soil

2459
01:22:51,359 --> 01:22:57,198
right it doesn't work that way

2460
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:57,840
right so then you've got to put in

2461
01:22:57,198 --> 01:22:59,759
control

2462
01:22:57,840 --> 01:23:01,279
animals and so forth and you've got to

2463
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:03,520
play the game with

2464
01:23:01,279 --> 01:23:05,119
keeping them eating the food on the

2465
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:06,159
cover crop you got going and that kind

2466
01:23:05,119 --> 01:23:08,479
of stuff and

2467
01:23:06,158 --> 01:23:10,559
and play the game with them right well

2468
01:23:08,479 --> 01:23:12,079
that's that's a complicated operation to

2469
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:12,880
explain to somebody and have somebody

2470
01:23:12,079 --> 01:23:16,319
just start

2471
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:18,560
new at with a 20 000 foot square right

2472
01:23:16,319 --> 01:23:21,840
i mean that's some dirt man that's some

2473
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:21,840
property you know what i mean

2474
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:26,960
the simple operation for somebody who

2475
01:23:24,719 --> 01:23:28,480
doesn't has never grown weed

2476
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:31,439
is to grow hydroponics because it's more

2477
01:23:28,479 --> 01:23:33,198
controllable plus the fact

2478
01:23:31,439 --> 01:23:34,960
i'm bringing in all tissue culture

2479
01:23:33,198 --> 01:23:36,719
there's i've got a dog's doing all the

2480
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:38,399
tissue culture for us so boom

2481
01:23:36,719 --> 01:23:39,920
everything will go in tissue culture so

2482
01:23:38,399 --> 01:23:42,238
they're exact replicas

2483
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:43,600
they'll grow the same be you know seed

2484
01:23:42,238 --> 01:23:45,279
green perfect

2485
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:46,880
the same height same width same

2486
01:23:45,279 --> 01:23:48,880
everything in the plant so

2487
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:50,880
that makes it much easier to grow inside

2488
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:52,639
too and especially hydroponics so we can

2489
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:55,520
roll them quicker like you say

2490
01:23:52,639 --> 01:23:57,600
i'm hoping to do it you know 45 days or

2491
01:23:55,520 --> 01:24:00,560
so

2492
01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:01,120
i'd like to hit 45 50 days and roll and

2493
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:03,520
you know

2494
01:24:01,119 --> 01:24:05,039
do it like that we've got a freezer

2495
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:08,159
already bought and going down

2496
01:24:05,039 --> 01:24:10,960
so everything will go crowd trimmed

2497
01:24:08,158 --> 01:24:11,599
it'll be trimmed right well boxed

2498
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:14,079
trimmed

2499
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:15,679
and then put right in the freezer and

2500
01:24:14,079 --> 01:24:16,719
then after it does 24 hours in the

2501
01:24:15,679 --> 01:24:18,880
freezer

2502
01:24:16,719 --> 01:24:19,920
at minus 20 then it starts to go to the

2503
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:22,079
freeze dryer and we'll

2504
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:23,679
we'll be able to do roughly 30 pounds of

2505
01:24:22,079 --> 01:24:27,039
finished dry per run

2506
01:24:23,679 --> 01:24:29,520
20 to 30 somewhere in that range per run

2507
01:24:27,039 --> 01:24:30,319
and that's every less than 24 hours

2508
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:32,800
roughly

2509
01:24:30,319 --> 01:24:33,439
and then i'll have a 24 hour to a 48

2510
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:36,239
hour

2511
01:24:33,439 --> 01:24:37,439
rejuvenation time before we'll be able

2512
01:24:36,238 --> 01:24:38,879
to send it to the distributor for

2513
01:24:37,439 --> 01:24:42,000
packaging

2514
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:43,600
but we'll basically from start from

2515
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:47,279
harvest

2516
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:50,320
to finish will be a week

2517
01:24:47,279 --> 01:24:52,238
i need to learn to get on that level

2518
01:24:50,319 --> 01:24:54,158
and i don't mean for myself man because

2519
01:24:52,238 --> 01:24:55,439
i want to i want to get there i feel

2520
01:24:54,158 --> 01:24:58,559
like

2521
01:24:55,439 --> 01:24:59,599
we got like the new generation and the

2522
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:02,800
now generation

2523
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:04,719
like the incoming

2524
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:06,960
yeah you guys still using buckets and

2525
01:25:04,719 --> 01:25:07,439
canoe paddles right like i was 40 years

2526
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:13,840
ago

2527
01:25:07,439 --> 01:25:13,839
okay yeah and this is all new

2528
01:25:22,319 --> 01:25:26,238
frank will tell you this i've been

2529
01:25:24,319 --> 01:25:26,960
saying this so look man it's 20 20 you

2530
01:25:26,238 --> 01:25:29,678
guys

2531
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:30,239
you kids come on now you i know you know

2532
01:25:29,679 --> 01:25:31,679
better

2533
01:25:30,238 --> 01:25:33,119
all right you got all these electronic

2534
01:25:31,679 --> 01:25:34,158
fucking things you guys can beat the

2535
01:25:33,119 --> 01:25:36,719
fuck out of me in those

2536
01:25:34,158 --> 01:25:38,799
games on tv and shit right i don't play

2537
01:25:36,719 --> 01:25:40,480
that my thumbs don't do that crap

2538
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:42,239
right but you guys know all this

2539
01:25:40,479 --> 01:25:44,079
computer shit but i don't see any

2540
01:25:42,238 --> 01:25:46,638
computer i see a canoe paddle and a

2541
01:25:44,079 --> 01:25:50,319
trash can

2542
01:25:46,639 --> 01:25:53,520
right okay come on man come on

2543
01:25:50,319 --> 01:25:54,000
right that can't be i mean you know and

2544
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:55,840
i

2545
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:57,439
the thing is it does work but then i

2546
01:25:55,840 --> 01:26:00,000
look at the equipment that's being made

2547
01:25:57,439 --> 01:26:02,000
and people are you know all everybody's

2548
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:03,119
trying to understand how they can

2549
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:06,158
manipulate

2550
01:26:03,119 --> 01:26:08,158
the weed in the ice and water and not

2551
01:26:06,158 --> 01:26:10,158
hurt the plant

2552
01:26:08,158 --> 01:26:12,000
well how about how about i answer that

2553
01:26:10,158 --> 01:26:15,039
simple question

2554
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:17,600
you can't it will

2555
01:26:15,039 --> 01:26:18,479
injure the plant material how's that it

2556
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:22,000
will

2557
01:26:18,479 --> 01:26:24,000
if you've got ice in with plant material

2558
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:25,359
it's gonna run into it they're gonna

2559
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:27,439
smash together

2560
01:26:25,359 --> 01:26:28,639
it's gonna cut stuff off on a sharp edge

2561
01:26:27,439 --> 01:26:32,238
it's gonna rub

2562
01:26:28,639 --> 01:26:34,960
things together or get squeezed between

2563
01:26:32,238 --> 01:26:35,439
and chlorophyll is not a tough material

2564
01:26:34,960 --> 01:26:37,198
so

2565
01:26:35,439 --> 01:26:38,638
you know and yeah you're getting it cold

2566
01:26:37,198 --> 01:26:39,759
so it gets tougher as it gets cold and

2567
01:26:38,639 --> 01:26:40,319
all that fun stuff but you're still

2568
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:43,440
gonna

2569
01:26:40,319 --> 01:26:46,479
have all that that micro biomass

2570
01:26:43,439 --> 01:26:47,839
right and just rub off stuff

2571
01:26:46,479 --> 01:26:49,759
so you got to learn how to sip it out

2572
01:26:47,840 --> 01:26:52,239
and filter it out where that's where

2573
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:54,960
changing the water

2574
01:26:52,238 --> 01:26:57,519
and making it an oxidizer or using

2575
01:26:54,960 --> 01:27:00,480
different things you know

2576
01:26:57,520 --> 01:27:01,760
oh alkali whatever oxygenation whatever

2577
01:27:00,479 --> 01:27:03,839
it may be and there's

2578
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:05,039
just depending on the volume again of

2579
01:27:03,840 --> 01:27:08,159
your operation

2580
01:27:05,039 --> 01:27:09,760
is which one would fit for you because

2581
01:27:08,158 --> 01:27:10,079
like you say at a certain level i mean

2582
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:11,920
the

2583
01:27:10,079 --> 01:27:14,000
for the machine people i'm talking with

2584
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:16,239
all of them you know that that

2585
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:18,960
that the unit to go on to their machine

2586
01:27:16,238 --> 01:27:21,279
is going to start at twenty thousand

2587
01:27:18,960 --> 01:27:22,880
okay it probably will end up somewhere

2588
01:27:21,279 --> 01:27:25,119
between there and thirty

2589
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:25,920
right and that's gonna be the add-on to

2590
01:27:25,119 --> 01:27:28,238
that

2591
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:29,359
hashtag machine that ice machine

2592
01:27:28,238 --> 01:27:32,319
whatever it is a

2593
01:27:29,359 --> 01:27:33,920
whistler tech whatever it may be because

2594
01:27:32,319 --> 01:27:35,519
these people are knocking out you know

2595
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:37,840
some of them doing a thousand gallons of

2596
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:40,560
wastewater a day

2597
01:27:37,840 --> 01:27:42,319
right and that ease back east they can't

2598
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:43,360
put it down the rain they won't let them

2599
01:27:42,319 --> 01:27:46,399
because after about

2600
01:27:43,359 --> 01:27:48,479
24 hours that shit because the terpenes

2601
01:27:46,399 --> 01:27:50,638
are mixed into the water

2602
01:27:48,479 --> 01:27:53,119
the bacteria is just love that shit and

2603
01:27:50,639 --> 01:27:55,199
it starts to wreak and stink

2604
01:27:53,119 --> 01:27:56,719
it just starts to smell if you keep it

2605
01:27:55,198 --> 01:27:58,319
around if you don't wash it down a drain

2606
01:27:56,719 --> 01:27:59,760
or get rid of it somewhere

2607
01:27:58,319 --> 01:28:01,198
you leave it around for a day to two

2608
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:02,400
days i'll guarantee you're going to

2609
01:28:01,198 --> 01:28:04,238
start smelling it

2610
01:28:02,399 --> 01:28:05,439
you know can you water the garden with

2611
01:28:04,238 --> 01:28:07,599
it you think

2612
01:28:05,439 --> 01:28:08,879
well no the trouble is is the terpenes

2613
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:10,320
have washed off and all the dirt

2614
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:10,960
whatever was on the plant is in that

2615
01:28:10,319 --> 01:28:12,479
water

2616
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:14,000
and then there's trichomes too because

2617
01:28:12,479 --> 01:28:16,638
you know it's the bottom end and the

2618
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:17,840
top end whatever they clutch so what

2619
01:28:16,639 --> 01:28:19,440
they're doing is they're putting a

2620
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:20,079
thousand gallons a day in a tank in the

2621
01:28:19,439 --> 01:28:21,759
ground

2622
01:28:20,079 --> 01:28:24,399
and then they had a waste company come

2623
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:26,880
in and there's 75 grand a year to haul

2624
01:28:24,399 --> 01:28:29,439
away the waste water

2625
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:31,520
all right so now they can buy a water

2626
01:28:29,439 --> 01:28:33,439
treatment machine for 50 grand

2627
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:35,120
turn all that water back into water they

2628
01:28:33,439 --> 01:28:36,399
can use and the waste they can haul to

2629
01:28:35,119 --> 01:28:38,000
the dump themselves because it's not

2630
01:28:36,399 --> 01:28:40,000
hazardous anymore

2631
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:42,639
because i can take arsenic 2 and make it

2632
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:46,079
arsenic 3 different things like that

2633
01:28:42,639 --> 01:28:46,800
see what is that i was i wasn't insulted

2634
01:28:46,079 --> 01:28:48,479
at all

2635
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:50,000
they're facts for facts like i'm

2636
01:28:48,479 --> 01:28:53,119
literally just starting this

2637
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:55,600
and you clearly have the experience and

2638
01:28:53,119 --> 01:28:59,039
i want to learn that

2639
01:28:55,600 --> 01:29:01,440
i mean don't get me wrong

2640
01:28:59,039 --> 01:29:02,399
i've been doing this a long time and

2641
01:29:01,439 --> 01:29:04,158
like you know

2642
01:29:02,399 --> 01:29:05,679
bird says this class i used to say in my

2643
01:29:04,158 --> 01:29:07,759
classes what i teach too

2644
01:29:05,679 --> 01:29:08,719
i don't i'm not smarter than anybody in

2645
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:12,000
the room

2646
01:29:08,719 --> 01:29:13,119
i just work harder at it do you have

2647
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,960
anyone like

2648
01:29:13,119 --> 01:29:16,479
under you that is like that you're

2649
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:19,520
training to be like you

2650
01:29:16,479 --> 01:29:19,839
oh no no and i'm not the hash guy i'm

2651
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:22,880
not

2652
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:24,960
i'm not the ash guy i'm not i know

2653
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:26,639
equipment i know processes i know

2654
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:29,039
chemistry and you know that kind of

2655
01:29:26,639 --> 01:29:31,119
stuff and i always try and find that how

2656
01:29:29,039 --> 01:29:33,279
can we do it better

2657
01:29:31,119 --> 01:29:35,119
how can we make this simpler how can we

2658
01:29:33,279 --> 01:29:37,359
make the process

2659
01:29:35,119 --> 01:29:38,559
better you know and you know it's like

2660
01:29:37,359 --> 01:29:40,079
hand trimming weed

2661
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:42,000
i'll tell you everybody in the world

2662
01:29:40,079 --> 01:29:43,039
hand trimming weed is the best way to

2663
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:46,560
trim

2664
01:29:43,039 --> 01:29:50,560
as long as you only got 10 pounds okay

2665
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:53,600
but if you're going to do 90 000 pounds

2666
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:56,560
how are you going to do that yes how

2667
01:29:53,600 --> 01:30:00,079
many trimmers are you going to bring in

2668
01:29:56,560 --> 01:30:03,280
unsustainable yeah you can't it's it's

2669
01:30:00,079 --> 01:30:05,279
not scalable as we call it you can't

2670
01:30:03,279 --> 01:30:07,359
increase that business you can't make it

2671
01:30:05,279 --> 01:30:09,198
go from five employees to a hundred

2672
01:30:07,359 --> 01:30:10,880
employees to a thousand employees to

2673
01:30:09,198 --> 01:30:13,279
five thousand employees

2674
01:30:10,880 --> 01:30:15,679
because i guarantee you it's gonna start

2675
01:30:13,279 --> 01:30:18,960
killing people

2676
01:30:15,679 --> 01:30:20,560
you know it's too many humans it's just

2677
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:22,800
too many humans in the loop

2678
01:30:20,560 --> 01:30:24,480
the more ways you can get humans out of

2679
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:27,440
the loop in production

2680
01:30:24,479 --> 01:30:29,198
the better to a point okay a lot of

2681
01:30:27,439 --> 01:30:29,919
times and that's where in bubble hashing

2682
01:30:29,198 --> 01:30:32,799
i just kind of

2683
01:30:29,920 --> 01:30:34,719
laugh because it you know you get into

2684
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:36,639
using trash cans well now you gotta have

2685
01:30:34,719 --> 01:30:38,639
two burly guys to haul that shit

2686
01:30:36,639 --> 01:30:40,400
well now of course if you're legal oh

2687
01:30:38,639 --> 01:30:42,079
boy you gotta worry about workman's comp

2688
01:30:40,399 --> 01:30:43,920
did the guy hurt his back

2689
01:30:42,079 --> 01:30:46,000
has he got the right leverage just to

2690
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:48,158
wait too much is this that that

2691
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:50,479
is the distance between here and there

2692
01:30:48,158 --> 01:30:51,679
right you know it's the floor non-slip

2693
01:30:50,479 --> 01:30:53,519
you know i mean it's

2694
01:30:51,679 --> 01:30:55,600
it becomes and then i have to tell

2695
01:30:53,520 --> 01:30:56,480
people you got to understand these rules

2696
01:30:55,600 --> 01:30:58,320
aren't going to get

2697
01:30:56,479 --> 01:31:00,079
better they're getting worse and they

2698
01:30:58,319 --> 01:31:02,799
will be getting worse

2699
01:31:00,079 --> 01:31:03,279
and they don't want you a little guy to

2700
01:31:02,800 --> 01:31:05,840
make it

2701
01:31:03,279 --> 01:31:07,679
period yeah okay you've got to keep

2702
01:31:05,840 --> 01:31:08,239
pushing for the medical you got to keep

2703
01:31:07,679 --> 01:31:11,199
pushing

2704
01:31:08,238 --> 01:31:11,599
for the medical permitting to be stay

2705
01:31:11,198 --> 01:31:14,079
there

2706
01:31:11,600 --> 01:31:16,320
it needs to be actually increased and

2707
01:31:14,079 --> 01:31:17,679
prop 64 in my opinion needs to be thrown

2708
01:31:16,319 --> 01:31:20,079
out but that's me

2709
01:31:17,679 --> 01:31:22,800
you know because it never was what they

2710
01:31:20,079 --> 01:31:25,439
they turned it over to every thief them

2711
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:27,039
every city and county to to charge their

2712
01:31:25,439 --> 01:31:28,960
own little thief and taxes and make

2713
01:31:27,039 --> 01:31:31,679
their own rules like they always do

2714
01:31:28,960 --> 01:31:32,960
and what have they all done look around

2715
01:31:31,679 --> 01:31:34,800
right

2716
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:36,480
you know is it working anywhere is

2717
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:38,000
anybody you know what's happening to the

2718
01:31:36,479 --> 01:31:39,759
people in the middle

2719
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:41,198
nothing you know they're getting crushed

2720
01:31:39,760 --> 01:31:46,239
just like all the restaurants

2721
01:31:41,198 --> 01:31:48,799
in the middle it's really sad but yeah

2722
01:31:46,238 --> 01:31:50,238
i hear that i hate to see this because i

2723
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:52,400
think there's these super

2724
01:31:50,238 --> 01:31:53,279
secret sessions and all that i totally

2725
01:31:52,399 --> 01:31:55,198
believe in them

2726
01:31:53,279 --> 01:31:56,319
but on the same side there what really

2727
01:31:55,198 --> 01:31:58,079
bothers me

2728
01:31:56,319 --> 01:31:59,920
because that's the medical you know

2729
01:31:58,079 --> 01:32:02,079
that's the 215 right that's

2730
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:03,440
a you know what i mean that's the one

2731
01:32:02,079 --> 01:32:06,238
right

2732
01:32:03,439 --> 01:32:07,759
and you go there and nothing there is

2733
01:32:06,238 --> 01:32:11,198
tested

2734
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:13,199
generally right

2735
01:32:11,198 --> 01:32:15,678
and you go to the dispensary where it's

2736
01:32:13,198 --> 01:32:17,279
all tested but it's not medical

2737
01:32:15,679 --> 01:32:18,800
right oh well you got medical

2738
01:32:17,279 --> 01:32:20,319
dispensaries too i'm sorry

2739
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:22,079
but then you go to the recreational one

2740
01:32:20,319 --> 01:32:23,840
and oh yeah anyone can come in here and

2741
01:32:22,079 --> 01:32:25,119
buy anything and oh yeah and this is

2742
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:26,960
tested stuff

2743
01:32:25,119 --> 01:32:29,039
so it's like wait a minute we started

2744
01:32:26,960 --> 01:32:30,480
off trying to help medical patients

2745
01:32:29,039 --> 01:32:33,439
because we had cancer

2746
01:32:30,479 --> 01:32:33,759
and aids going on wild and everybody

2747
01:32:33,439 --> 01:32:36,158
thought

2748
01:32:33,760 --> 01:32:38,320
yeah this works but yeah let them be

2749
01:32:36,158 --> 01:32:41,839
able to eat after chemotherapy that's

2750
01:32:38,319 --> 01:32:42,639
good okay they're dying anyway god damn

2751
01:32:41,840 --> 01:32:45,440
it let them eat

2752
01:32:42,639 --> 01:32:46,639
right that was good and then what did

2753
01:32:45,439 --> 01:32:50,079
that morph into

2754
01:32:46,639 --> 01:32:51,440
where are we now right did it get better

2755
01:32:50,079 --> 01:32:53,039
for the patients i don't see these

2756
01:32:51,439 --> 01:32:53,599
companies that are making millions of

2757
01:32:53,039 --> 01:32:55,679
dollars

2758
01:32:53,600 --> 01:32:57,360
and millions of dozens i don't see them

2759
01:32:55,679 --> 01:33:00,239
going to cancer words and giving

2760
01:32:57,359 --> 01:33:01,359
free free whatever that patient wants

2761
01:33:00,238 --> 01:33:03,039
you want edibles you

2762
01:33:01,359 --> 01:33:04,960
want smoke you want god's what do you

2763
01:33:03,039 --> 01:33:08,079
want here you go

2764
01:33:04,960 --> 01:33:09,679
boom right there terminal jesus

2765
01:33:08,079 --> 01:33:12,000
christ try and help him you know what i

2766
01:33:09,679 --> 01:33:13,760
mean it can't be that bad now hopefully

2767
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:15,039
the more act does allow for science

2768
01:33:13,760 --> 01:33:16,880
studies and all that

2769
01:33:15,039 --> 01:33:18,639
but once you throw the banking in and

2770
01:33:16,880 --> 01:33:20,400
allow it

2771
01:33:18,639 --> 01:33:22,159
it's going to get really wild and

2772
01:33:20,399 --> 01:33:23,920
hopefully the people that have got their

2773
01:33:22,158 --> 01:33:25,519
foot in the door and that can keep their

2774
01:33:23,920 --> 01:33:27,279
head above water and there's all i can

2775
01:33:25,520 --> 01:33:29,679
say because i just don't see it

2776
01:33:27,279 --> 01:33:31,439
becoming easier and i know you're doing

2777
01:33:29,679 --> 01:33:34,079
great and i'm not putting down

2778
01:33:31,439 --> 01:33:36,158
anyone and saying hey start and do

2779
01:33:34,079 --> 01:33:39,119
whatever you think you need to do

2780
01:33:36,158 --> 01:33:40,559
okay do that and if you can concentrate

2781
01:33:39,119 --> 01:33:43,039
and doing it honestly

2782
01:33:40,560 --> 01:33:44,800
and doing it respectfully people will

2783
01:33:43,039 --> 01:33:45,439
respect that and you will keep doing

2784
01:33:44,800 --> 01:33:48,560
business

2785
01:33:45,439 --> 01:33:50,319
that's all i gotta say in that respect

2786
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:52,320
but you know if you go out and set

not many people that do what i do i

2886
01:37:03,760 --> 01:37:06,880
