[Music]

2
00:00:07,879 --> 00:00:14,370
or near and dear to my heart and going

3
00:00:12,089 --> 00:00:15,689
through what the legislature and and has

4
00:00:14,369 --> 00:00:17,969
been an ongoing debate with the

5
00:00:15,689 --> 00:00:22,618
regulators it our compassion and trade

6
00:00:17,969 --> 00:00:25,618
samples we all get that they don't want

7
00:00:22,618 --> 00:00:27,750
brands to give me free samples way to

8
00:00:25,618 --> 00:00:31,198
every consumer who walks down the street

9
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:33,988
but when a new brand is trying to get

10
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:39,600
into a retail operation in any industry

11
00:00:33,988 --> 00:00:42,479
they get yeah when they put out their

12
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,308
regulations they have to put out an F

13
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:46,199
what's called an F SOR which is a final

14
00:00:44,308 --> 00:00:48,899
statement of a reason that explains

15
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:51,930
every single rule they make and in that

16
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:56,359
particular section they say exactly that

17
00:00:51,929 --> 00:01:01,409
they believe that it could create

18
00:00:56,359 --> 00:01:03,628
diversion of products and that was sort

19
00:01:01,409 --> 00:01:05,250
of it wasn't a very long answer if I

20
00:01:03,628 --> 00:01:10,500
remember correctly it was just saying

21
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:13,560
that past experiences with that which I

22
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:16,759
assume well must have been based on the

23
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:19,200
unregulated or less regulated market in

24
00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:21,118
California well I don't want to say

25
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,840
unregulated the you know the Bay Area

26
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:27,659
has been very highly legacy market this

27
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:31,590
also comes back to an element of trust

28
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:33,780
and you know sort of an evolution of

29
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:35,250
misinformation and stereotyping and a

30
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,659
lot of these rules when you look at

31
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:40,349
cannabis being regulated like for

32
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:42,150
lutonium sort of you can connect that

33
00:01:40,349 --> 00:01:44,158
back with Prohibition and reefer badness

34
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:47,310
and that's really the reason of this

35
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:52,200
sort of very slow tightly regulated

36
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:54,478
incremental approach and so when you

37
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:59,549
could

38
00:01:54,478 --> 00:02:02,340
towards cancer patients talk about what

39
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:03,990
it was like then and what it's like now

40
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:06,990
when you have to look that same cancer

41
00:02:03,989 --> 00:02:08,939
patient in the eyes and be like sorry

42
00:02:06,989 --> 00:02:10,859
well that's been really tough because we

43
00:02:08,939 --> 00:02:13,560
started a program many many years ago

44
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:15,269
called the helping hands and where we

45
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,550
gave free cannabis to low and no income

46
00:02:15,269 --> 00:02:20,069
patients the c---berkeley actually

47
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:23,130
modeled that and made it a law for all

48
00:02:20,068 --> 00:02:25,798
retailers and once it sews anybody with

49
00:02:23,129 --> 00:02:28,079
a doctor's recommendation and once these

50
00:02:25,799 --> 00:02:30,719
new laws went into effect and the bureau

51
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:34,110
said that we could not give free

52
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:36,150
cannabis to anyone without and MMIC card

53
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:38,849
which is very explicitly stated in the

54
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:42,539
law but they there were certain

55
00:02:38,848 --> 00:02:45,839
exceptions that were made by different

56
00:02:42,539 --> 00:02:49,348
regulators for that particular exception

57
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:52,590
and they so we have had to tell people

58
00:02:49,348 --> 00:02:54,959
that have been on this list that could

59
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:58,560
not get MMIC cards or have had a lot of

60
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:01,979
challenges getting MMIC cards that they

61
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:04,039
were removed from the program and so we

62
00:03:01,979 --> 00:03:09,328
can't give them to them for free anymore

63
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:11,099
and so we've lost probably half of the

64
00:03:09,329 --> 00:03:13,500
number of people that were part of the

65
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:15,959
program which is really sad and we I

66
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:18,780
mean we we give it to them at a we don't

67
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:21,359
give it it we sell it at a very low rate

68
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:22,859
like under market rate but we have to

69
00:03:21,359 --> 00:03:26,040
sell it where we're not allowed to give

70
00:03:22,859 --> 00:03:28,250
it away to those patients and that's

71
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:32,370
really unfortunate and it's you know

72
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:36,629
made a lot of people drop off the

73
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:38,099
program and gotten it's it's been tough

74
00:03:36,629 --> 00:03:41,129
because Berkeley patients group has

75
00:03:38,098 --> 00:03:50,370
really been you know Alexi operator of

76
00:03:41,129 --> 00:04:01,229
compassion and yeah yeah that's not

77
00:03:50,370 --> 00:04:03,719
going away I mean the medical the

78
00:04:01,229 --> 00:04:06,179
medical program that we that exists

79
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:07,949
today yes but I don't think that medical

80
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:09,299
cannabis is going to go away I think

81
00:04:07,949 --> 00:04:11,429
people patients are gonna be using

82
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:14,159
cannabis as more research is being done

83
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:15,989
every day on on the benefits of cannabis

84
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:18,269
and specific cannabinoids and the

85
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:22,709
conditions that they help and so there's

86
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:25,769
gonna be a ton of medicines just not the

87
00:04:22,709 --> 00:04:27,779
compassion just not in the traditional

88
00:04:25,769 --> 00:04:30,359
medical marijuana market that we are

89
00:04:27,779 --> 00:04:32,609
have known and are familiar with you're

90
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:34,860
a very nice person you really are

91
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:37,050
I'm a little bit angry about this

92
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:39,538
because I think it's unacceptable that

93
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:42,900
the state would not allow the people who

94
00:04:39,538 --> 00:04:46,079
need this medication to get it at for

95
00:04:42,899 --> 00:04:48,750
free if they need it and I'm outraged as

96
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:51,180
a patient that I have to pay a sin tax

97
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:53,819
right which is essentially literally an

98
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:54,490
act to get this and I can barely afford

99
00:04:53,819 --> 00:04:59,199
it

100
00:04:54,490 --> 00:05:01,060
so as a consumer and as a patient I as

101
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,250
working with him on this we're gonna

102
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:05,709
continue this fight because absolutely

103
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:07,389
it all comes down yeah on people like me

104
00:05:05,709 --> 00:05:09,189
and Jen drive those people into the

105
00:05:07,389 --> 00:05:11,470
black more absolutely you know I

106
00:05:09,189 --> 00:05:13,240
wouldn't more point on the compassion I

107
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:18,880
think an argument can be made I'm not a

108
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:23,860
lawyer but I truly think that it is a

109
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:27,370
violation of prop 215 and 64 to restrict

110
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:32,229
the compassion programs and donations

111
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:40,149
like they are right now I'm also not a

112
00:05:32,228 --> 00:05:42,189
lawyer like a class action I think so I

113
00:05:40,149 --> 00:05:44,560
think so yeah absolutely

114
00:05:42,189 --> 00:05:48,339
because it wasn't supposed to interfere

115
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:54,220
with any anything crupp 215 said prop

116
00:05:48,339 --> 00:05:57,310
215 said safe affordable access and for

117
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:59,259
people that can't afford affordable

118
00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:01,478
means free and that's how this isn't the

119
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:04,419
entire compassion probe this entire

120
00:06:01,478 --> 00:06:08,408
industry was birthed out of compassion

121
00:06:04,418 --> 00:06:10,870
out of the AIDS crisis and I mean if

122
00:06:08,408 --> 00:06:13,418
there's anything that should remain in

123
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:16,060
this ever-changing industry it should be

124
00:06:13,418 --> 00:06:20,939
the compassion and the social awareness

125
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:20,939
that birthed it so where

126
00:06:31,209 --> 00:06:46,239
as a whole it's it's shrinking okay so

127
00:06:42,259 --> 00:06:49,250
we've talked the compassion kind of free

128
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,210
giveaways but then talk about the tree

129
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:52,519
mm-hmm

130
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:56,169
so when brands because I would assume

131
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:56,169
it's part for a new brand to come in

132
00:06:56,769 --> 00:07:10,969
yeah it's a very complicated process

133
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:14,660
with a lot of moving pieces and you know

134
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:15,940
a different people have were we have to

135
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:19,640
make sure that everything is done

136
00:07:15,939 --> 00:07:22,759
aboveboard completely compliant and you

137
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:23,990
know when it comes to different people

138
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:25,610
have different interpretations on how

139
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:27,379
that works and I think you know some

140
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:32,530
people take the rules more seriously

141
00:07:27,379 --> 00:07:36,529
than others so it's it's it has just

142
00:07:32,529 --> 00:07:39,739
become a challenge that is not necessary

143
00:07:36,529 --> 00:07:42,919
and again this also goes back to this is

144
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:44,569
a an outgrowth of reefer madness

145
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:46,280
propaganda and prohibition there is

146
00:07:44,569 --> 00:07:48,709
absolutely every other industry does

147
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:50,719
this there's even pharmaceuticals to do

148
00:07:48,709 --> 00:07:52,819
this you can have you can get samples of

149
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:57,350
pharmacy you know scheduled to narcotics

150
00:07:52,819 --> 00:08:00,949
for free and the one of the arguments

151
00:07:57,350 --> 00:08:03,260
was the you know the diversion and the

152
00:08:00,949 --> 00:08:06,019
tracking and things like that but this

153
00:08:03,259 --> 00:08:08,389
is it is 2019 we put a man on the moon

154
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:12,699
in the 60s we can we can code in a

155
00:08:08,389 --> 00:08:15,709
little line to make sure that you know

156
00:08:12,699 --> 00:08:18,050
trade samples get into metric and get

157
00:08:15,709 --> 00:08:19,969
into track and trace this is not this is

158
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:23,509
something that pharmaceutical industry

159
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:25,370
does this is there there are so many

160
00:08:23,509 --> 00:08:26,959
ways to do this and this is the only way

161
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:29,180
that new business that we're going to be

162
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:31,639
able to help new businesses get a

163
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:34,399
foothold in the industry because right

164
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:37,569
now only ones with with huge resources

165
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:41,289
are going to be able to have the

166
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:42,520
manpower to create teams that are going

167
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:45,879
to be creative and working with all

168
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:47,289
everybody - to get these new samples to

169
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:50,320
market or not samples get these new

170
00:08:47,289 --> 00:08:57,039
products to market in various ways

171
00:08:50,320 --> 00:09:02,020
so the best way for a company to get

172
00:08:57,039 --> 00:09:04,480
their their product introduced to the

173
00:09:02,019 --> 00:09:06,639
consumer base is to be able to have the

174
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:09,970
employees that are selling those

175
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:12,759
products be able to speak informatively

176
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:15,700
about them and be able to answer

177
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:17,470
questions and figure out what exactly a

178
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:18,970
particular customer is looking for and

179
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:21,970
if they don't know they're not going to

180
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:25,000
recommend a product and even as a

181
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:28,690
business you know we want to know what

182
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:32,769
we're selling our good products and so

183
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:35,080
if you can't do that it you know people

184
00:09:32,769 --> 00:09:37,269
your your store is base and your

185
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:39,670
reputation is based on on the products

186
00:09:37,269 --> 00:09:41,500
you sell your quality products and the

187
00:09:39,669 --> 00:09:46,959
service you provide those are your two

188
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:49,720
key retail components and so there has

189
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:52,889
to be a way to both support new small

190
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:55,420
businesses and ensure that you are

191
00:09:52,889 --> 00:10:06,009
providing the community and the customer

192
00:09:55,419 --> 00:10:07,719
is with the the best products to

193
00:10:06,009 --> 00:10:13,350
completely I see them as different

194
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:13,350
they're both free weed moving hands but

195
00:10:14,659 --> 00:10:20,838
as far as a sensible out is one of them

196
00:10:18,019 --> 00:10:23,089
baked into the law and the other at the

197
00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:27,920
whim of one of those three regulatory

198
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:29,560
agencies or are both those no free

199
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:32,990
anything to anyone

200
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:37,299
law or they both whim of one of the

201
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:49,269
three regulatory agencies trade samples

202
00:10:37,299 --> 00:10:52,809
is regulatory that would be the bureau

203
00:10:49,269 --> 00:10:55,399
and and and they are more than aware

204
00:10:52,809 --> 00:10:56,659
there's a bill there's a trade samples

205
00:10:55,399 --> 00:10:59,360
bill right now that's moving through

206
00:10:56,659 --> 00:11:05,088
sponsored by Senator Skinner or senator

207
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:07,430
and go Skinner and Flo canna and that's

208
00:11:05,089 --> 00:11:08,870
going to make things if it makes it all

209
00:11:07,429 --> 00:11:11,388
the way and the governor signs it which

210
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:13,250
I I certainly hope he will but yeah I

211
00:11:11,389 --> 00:11:15,198
mean people of really this has been if

212
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:18,889
this has been a debate and an issue

213
00:11:15,198 --> 00:11:20,889
since there were subcommittees I don't

214
00:11:18,889 --> 00:11:23,089
even know how many this must have been

215
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:24,860
27 I don't know when it was but there

216
00:11:23,089 --> 00:11:26,600
were there were all of these stakeholder

217
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:28,159
meetings with the regulators as they

218
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:30,589
were developing these regulations and

219
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:33,860
even after the first round in the next

220
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:36,680
round we've been debating trade samples

221
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:38,209
since the very beginning and I think

222
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:40,399
that this is something that people are

223
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:42,198
not going to let up on this needs to

224
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,879
happen we need to get normalized and

225
00:11:42,198 --> 00:11:46,088
treated like normal like any other

226
00:11:43,879 --> 00:11:46,088
business

227
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:54,970
we don't even know who a real patient is

228
00:11:53,139 --> 00:11:56,710
you know what what's a real patient

229
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:58,269
what's a you know so they're good

230
00:11:56,710 --> 00:12:00,670
they're potentially they'll be giving

231
00:11:58,269 --> 00:12:03,970
away you know I mean it doesn't make any

232
00:12:00,669 --> 00:12:06,219
sense but the state wants control right

233
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:08,259
they're the new middleman they're the

234
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:10,600
new drug dealer you know as far as

235
00:12:08,259 --> 00:12:12,220
cannabis goes and everything they're

236
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:16,230
promulgating at this moment is

237
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:18,490
pretending to maintain control

238
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:21,250
absolutely I mean yeah that's that was

239
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:24,759
what that's prop 64 that's melkor so

240
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:27,909
that they are the regulators and but

241
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:30,279
they were they they are they serve at

242
00:12:27,909 --> 00:12:32,350
the pleasure of the executive branch and

243
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:33,970
the governor's office and you know

244
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:36,399
there's politics politics is involved

245
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:38,410
this is a third less of but still

246
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:44,679
somewhat of a third rail issue and

247
00:12:38,409 --> 00:12:47,199
there's a lot of a lot of familiarizing

248
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:49,359
that needs to be needs to take place and

249
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:52,330
it's taking place and I think as every

250
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:54,279
year moves on and people get used to the

251
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:56,950
idea of legal legalization legal

252
00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:59,439
cannabis there think it's gonna be a

253
00:12:56,950 --> 00:13:05,070
process I mean look at Colorado Colorado

254
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:05,070
just passed delivery they've had yeah

255
00:13:12,419 --> 00:13:28,419
yeah exactly exactly yeah mm-hmm yeah I

256
00:13:25,299 --> 00:13:30,819
mean I always say you know provision is

257
00:13:28,419 --> 00:13:32,979
been going on for more than 80 years now

258
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:36,040
and we're just at this very early

259
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:38,470
starting point so I hope it doesn't take

260
00:13:36,039 --> 00:13:40,480
80 years to make up for all of that but

261
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:41,950
I think it's definitely not gonna happen

262
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,659
overnight and that's that's one of the

263
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:47,259
most important things that I've learned

264
00:13:43,659 --> 00:13:54,069
in this crazy process over the last few

265
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:56,559
years is that really have to take a it's

266
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:58,150
important to take a short-term picture

267
00:13:56,559 --> 00:13:59,938
but you really have to take a broader

268
00:13:58,149 --> 00:14:04,108
more long-term view

269
00:13:59,938 --> 00:14:05,879
of everything all of these policies all

270
00:14:04,109 --> 00:14:07,799
these regulations all these laws that

271
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:10,589
may work very well for you in the short

272
00:14:07,798 --> 00:14:12,658
term but long term might not work so

273
00:14:10,589 --> 00:14:17,759
well and there's a lot of things that

274
00:14:12,658 --> 00:14:19,078
could go wrong and that you maybe can

275
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:21,329
anticipate but maybe you can't

276
00:14:19,078 --> 00:14:24,508
anticipate so it is and not everything

277
00:14:21,328 --> 00:14:26,548
is as much of a crisis as it might feel

278
00:14:24,509 --> 00:14:29,489
like and there's you know I've seen

279
00:14:26,548 --> 00:14:32,958
burns rampant which is completely

280
00:14:29,489 --> 00:14:38,489
understandable but being able to

281
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:39,568
prioritize and be able and take a ticket

282
00:14:38,489 --> 00:14:41,339
just take a broader view a more

283
00:14:39,568 --> 00:14:44,068
long-term thing instead of thinking like

284
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:45,809
six months to a year which is important

285
00:14:44,068 --> 00:14:47,778
I mean you don't don't negate that but

286
00:14:45,808 --> 00:14:50,098
also think five to ten years from now

287
00:14:47,778 --> 00:14:51,658
now we don't know with anything any of

288
00:14:50,099 --> 00:14:54,599
these states are gonna look like ten

289
00:14:51,658 --> 00:14:56,609
nobody's hit ten years yet but I think

290
00:14:54,599 --> 00:14:58,889
that things are going to change a line

291
00:14:56,609 --> 00:15:00,359
some of these rules are gonna most of

292
00:14:58,889 --> 00:15:01,979
them are probably gonna stay the same

293
00:15:00,359 --> 00:15:04,049
but I think there's gonna be some

294
00:15:01,979 --> 00:15:07,049
significant changes you know another

295
00:15:04,048 --> 00:15:11,399
thing for patience the Edible potency

296
00:15:07,048 --> 00:15:13,798
cap needs to be either removed for

297
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:16,470
patients or raised for patients it not

298
00:15:13,798 --> 00:15:18,958
necessarily adult consumers but for

299
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:23,298
patients I think 100 milligrams for an

300
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:26,508
edible is not fair and too expensive and

301
00:15:23,298 --> 00:15:26,509
should be

302
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:38,050
that is an agency level descent decision

303
00:15:33,879 --> 00:15:41,470
now curse' does not put a potency cap

304
00:15:38,049 --> 00:15:43,809
yeah yeah what's in their regulation

305
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:48,100
yeah so my last question is a heartful

306
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:51,159
how much weed does a government liaison

307
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:52,960
have to smoke to keep her sanity as she

308
00:15:51,159 --> 00:16:05,679
deals with the government depends on the

309
00:15:52,960 --> 00:16:09,129
strain yeah like I hit my 11 years in

310
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:16,028
the cannabis space last month this month

311
00:16:09,129 --> 00:16:21,639
today's 31st no no for 11 years I feel

312
00:16:16,028 --> 00:16:25,028
like it's time to retire I worked for

313
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:28,740
normal national normal in DC yeah there

314
00:16:25,028 --> 00:16:28,740
wasn't really an industry back then
