2
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:09,480
really boring really it's efficiencies

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,030
kind of all we talk about you know math

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:14,039
and numbers on how can we save a couple

5
00:00:12,029 --> 00:00:16,079
pennies over here on energy versus using

6
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:19,079
big screens like if I had to boil down

7
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:21,118
what was said today is that uh membranes

8
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:23,459
which is a big filter that that was kind

9
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:25,018
of like the takeaway that I think will

10
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:27,359
be most valuable to the most amount of

11
00:00:25,018 --> 00:00:30,358
people that was something that it's been

12
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,130
out there but it's been not as openly

13
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:33,899
talked about as it was today so that was

14
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:36,000
interesting I thought I saw the

15
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:38,009
hesitation and no his eyes saying it out

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,829
loud and then he went with it so it's

17
00:00:38,009 --> 00:00:50,250
interesting it was immediately there and

18
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:52,198
he was just like all right oh yeah dread

19
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:55,259
pirate is here with some of this crc and

20
00:00:52,198 --> 00:00:59,820
that stuff was incredible oh yeah I

21
00:00:55,259 --> 00:01:03,948
think it was a dinner but uh oh look how

22
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,948
about that you got the good stuff

23
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:15,750
who is no with he was with Harry and Ken

24
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:19,520
and ace from beaker and wrench that was

25
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:19,519
a good one I like that one

26
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:25,109
dread pirate he's on the forum he's the

27
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:27,120
guy that first released the CRC tech on

28
00:01:25,109 --> 00:01:32,450
the forum kind of like the first draft

29
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:32,450
of it with him in the end Oh fab guys

30
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:39,270
it's like a remediation of the

31
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:42,569
impurities that you don't necessarily

32
00:01:39,269 --> 00:01:45,479
want or need to smoke a lot of them are

33
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:48,209
color compounds and other random things

34
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:51,140
you do tend to pull a little bit of some

35
00:01:48,209 --> 00:01:53,969
of like the ethers or not eat there's uh

36
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:56,129
esters and and aldehydes and alcohols

37
00:01:53,969 --> 00:01:58,289
which kind of changes the smell we still

38
00:01:56,129 --> 00:01:59,549
got a really bright turkey smell from it

39
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:02,670
and all the mids but some of the lower

40
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:11,840
ones seem to sometimes tend to drag

41
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:11,840
behind in the column in the Sierra see I

42
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:17,370
definitely see RC stuff that looks

43
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:25,738
amazing and then tastes like trim you

44
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:28,800
know because it doesn't get rid but i've

45
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:30,629
also had I've also had some CR Sita I

46
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,200
think people aren't filtering enough and

47
00:02:30,629 --> 00:02:36,239
I definitely dab some that had some

48
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:38,729
filtration media left in it davin on

49
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,319
yeah something that people need to like

50
00:02:38,729 --> 00:02:43,679
make sure they're filtering that shit

51
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:46,259
you know that's my main thing I heard

52
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,540
that a Chas the a Chas bold did the same

53
00:02:46,259 --> 00:02:51,269
thing

54
00:02:47,539 --> 00:02:52,949
don't be shy I mean that's the future of

55
00:02:51,269 --> 00:02:54,480
you know with great power with great

56
00:02:52,949 --> 00:02:55,738
power comes great responsibility and

57
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:57,119
when we're starting to take these

58
00:02:55,739 --> 00:02:59,579
chemistry routes that isn't you know

59
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,640
they're not it's not just you know

60
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:04,439
making some charas what is going on with

61
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:08,188
dead skin and shit

62
00:03:04,438 --> 00:03:10,259
yeah it's returning returning a point

63
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:12,598
into actual you know trying to adopt

64
00:03:10,259 --> 00:03:14,878
pharmaceutical science and as absurd as

65
00:03:12,598 --> 00:03:17,098
homegrown pharmaceutical Sciences it's

66
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:19,289
what this one country that's something

67
00:03:17,098 --> 00:03:21,209
else so what this industry has done for

68
00:03:19,289 --> 00:03:23,310
the last seventy years means since

69
00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:25,200
Prohibition we've had to find our own

70
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:26,789
ways about doing things and that right

71
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:34,619
there is the culmination of it it's you

72
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:37,318
know the ultimate fuck you - that's the

73
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:39,000
ethereal the ethereal who I guess really

74
00:03:37,318 --> 00:03:41,009
whatever is trying that's that gets to a

75
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,199
personal level almost a spiritual level

76
00:03:41,009 --> 00:03:45,870
but what this means this is what happens

77
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:47,188
when people you know are you could call

78
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:49,188
it entrepreneurship you could call it

79
00:03:47,188 --> 00:03:51,689
capitalism but you know this is

80
00:03:49,188 --> 00:03:53,400
innovation the fluid innovation in

81
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:55,680
progress I mean we're watching it happen

82
00:03:53,400 --> 00:04:01,829
day by day and man it's just fascinating

83
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:04,949
to be able to be a part of it come to

84
00:04:01,829 --> 00:04:06,769
work with a plant under while being

85
00:04:04,949 --> 00:04:08,699
under immense oppression or you know

86
00:04:06,769 --> 00:04:18,149
obstacles or just you know legalization

87
00:04:08,699 --> 00:04:19,889
or whatnot sacrifice the potential for

88
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:21,538
your livelihood to even do science with

89
00:04:19,889 --> 00:04:22,918
this plan in the first place kind of

90
00:04:21,538 --> 00:04:24,300
comes to I guess like that accumulation

91
00:04:22,918 --> 00:04:27,538
where it's like this is the best science

92
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:30,300
we could do and bama's you know it's

93
00:04:27,538 --> 00:04:31,649
like next-level shit you know well this

94
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,360
is you know this is what happens when

95
00:04:31,649 --> 00:04:35,279
people innovate for themselves and we're

96
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,538
not relying on massive corporations to

97
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:38,848
take our innovation you know by the

98
00:04:36,538 --> 00:04:40,680
hills and do it for us because when you

99
00:04:38,848 --> 00:04:43,110
get to a certain point I mean you just

100
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,788
can't I mean that was Dustin's talk you

101
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:47,180
can't beat the open source it's not

102
00:04:44,788 --> 00:04:47,180
happening

103
00:04:48,269 --> 00:05:04,109
you would smoke that blood starting

104
00:05:00,329 --> 00:05:05,459
material credit to the Grover credit to

105
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:06,139
the processor it's all parts of the

106
00:05:05,459 --> 00:05:08,459
whole

107
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:12,930
it takes excellence in every step

108
00:05:08,459 --> 00:05:14,579
possible but the interesting thing is

109
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:16,430
really the potential that we have to do

110
00:05:14,579 --> 00:05:18,839
I mean these same refinement techniques

111
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:20,430
will take the will take place in other

112
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:22,168
industries and other nutraceutical I

113
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:24,509
mean we talked about a lot of mycology

114
00:05:22,168 --> 00:05:26,098
today and all these same refinement

115
00:05:24,509 --> 00:05:26,400
techniques are going to come up sooner

116
00:05:26,098 --> 00:05:28,918
or later

117
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:38,098
and it's cool if you can use cannabis

118
00:05:28,918 --> 00:05:39,629
with it but I know with I'm sure I don't

119
00:05:38,098 --> 00:05:41,430
know I'm sure the ball container

120
00:05:39,629 --> 00:05:43,228
corporation is pretty happy with all of

121
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:45,418
their mason jar sales and I'm sure

122
00:05:43,228 --> 00:05:47,068
there's some refineries out of Texas who

123
00:05:45,418 --> 00:05:52,918
has see these new places popping up

124
00:05:47,069 --> 00:05:53,908
they're capitalizing on it what kind of

125
00:05:52,918 --> 00:05:56,750
technique thing a different industry

126
00:05:53,908 --> 00:05:59,779
will learn from us you know compared to

127
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:59,779
you know

128
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:17,509
[Music]

129
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:23,860
[Music]

130
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:30,820
just like you guys are doing cool crazy

131
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:35,350
shit that people do extraction that's

132
00:06:30,819 --> 00:06:38,349
actually they do co2 they do co2

133
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:39,939
extraction and also I don't know they

134
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:43,270
they make like a distillate product

135
00:06:39,939 --> 00:06:45,910
which has terpenes that they post inject

136
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:48,519
to like flavor their stuff it's it's

137
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:51,220
pretty phenomenal opportunity we run

138
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:54,370
like super high margin which allows us a

139
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:56,320
lot of flexibility to run R&amp;D on our

140
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:58,959
product - I think that that helps and

141
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,310
the type of person that's in cannabis in

142
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:02,109
the cannabis industry right now is not

143
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:04,360
the same type of person that may have

144
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:07,060
gone a more traditional route with a

145
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:10,629
less you know they're they're they're

146
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:13,600
not as willing to take risk right as the

147
00:07:10,629 --> 00:07:14,680
typical cannabis person is because we've

148
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,300
been taking risk the whole fucking time

149
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:18,400
so you kind of have a different type of

150
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:19,990
person and that there's you know there's

151
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:21,969
pros and cons to each different side but

152
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:23,889
one of them is that we can have rapid

153
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:25,750
development and adaptation of new

154
00:07:23,889 --> 00:07:27,699
technologies better than any other

155
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:30,129
industry we've that I've seen we can

156
00:07:27,699 --> 00:07:31,599
scour the internet for obscure little

157
00:07:30,129 --> 00:07:33,430
pieces of data and convert it into

158
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,930
something that's making billions of

159
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:35,949
dollars like what show me another

160
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:38,069
industry that's doing something like

161
00:07:35,949 --> 00:07:38,069
that

162
00:07:53,149 --> 00:07:57,879
this is like the first cannabis cannabis

163
00:07:56,839 --> 00:08:00,310
snowman

164
00:07:57,879 --> 00:08:02,199
that I've been to since I got a 10-year

165
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:08,800
federal prison sentence for a cannabis

166
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:11,769

167

00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:34,839
something we need to pay reverence to

179
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:36,310
but we also need to realize there's

180
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,690
still plenty of people locked up because

181
00:08:36,309 --> 00:08:40,168

182
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:40,169
