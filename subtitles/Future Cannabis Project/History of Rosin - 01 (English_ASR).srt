shown support and is here to talk to

12
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:36,509
about the history of rosin we wanted to

13
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,890
provide a little education and throw it

14
00:00:36,509 --> 00:00:39,960
back to some of the people that have

15
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:43,370
been involved since day one that have

16
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:45,299
got us to where we're at today so

17
00:00:43,369 --> 00:00:46,558
Phillip did you want to say a little

18
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:50,788
something about yourself before we get

19
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:52,409
started I'm just here to talk about the

20
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:53,969
history of rosin I'm super excited about

21
00:00:52,409 --> 00:00:55,979
it I like where it's gone where it

22
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:58,879
started and where we're pushing towards

23
00:00:55,979 --> 00:01:01,858
so I'm just stoked to talk about it I

24
00:00:58,878 --> 00:01:04,140
don't well I'm gonna break into it I

25
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:06,719
love giving credit where credit's due

26
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:10,260
and I'm extremely blessed to have been

27
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:14,579
here from basically day one from when

28
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:17,460
this term was coined basically so a lot

29
00:01:14,579 --> 00:01:19,798
of this started before Instagram and

30
00:01:17,459 --> 00:01:22,408
before Facebook we had a lot of

31
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:24,479
underground forums and the forums were

32
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:27,810
where a lot of us growers and hash

33
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:29,039
makers gained a lot of our knowledge so

34
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:35,310
there was this gentleman named

35
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:40,320
confession compassion Co mph a s o n I

36
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:42,240
believe yes h o n but I also you know

37
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:44,669
his his name is out there freely his

38
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:46,319
name is chadwick Bastardo and i really

39
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:48,689
like to give credit to this gentleman

40
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:51,269
because back in the day there were a few

41
00:01:48,688 --> 00:01:55,889
forums that that I was on along with

42
00:01:51,269 --> 00:01:57,899
this gentleman compassion and he was

43
00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:00,000
really the one who started using this

44
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:01,680
term the term rosin has actually been

45
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,060
around for centuries it's been around

46
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:08,819
for a long time in the adhesive and in

47
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:11,430
that world the adhesive world just for a

48
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:14,699
gummy substance

49
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:16,230
you know sermons to like violins yeah

50
00:02:14,699 --> 00:02:18,719
rosin that term has been around for a

51
00:02:16,229 --> 00:02:20,699
long time it really was brought into the

52
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:23,699
cannabis industry when confession

53
00:02:20,699 --> 00:02:26,310
started utilizing a stainless steel bowl

54
00:02:23,699 --> 00:02:28,048
with the stainless steel spoon heating

55
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:30,688
up that bowl heating up that spoon and

56
00:02:28,049 --> 00:02:33,299
literally mechanically pressing his

57
00:02:30,688 --> 00:02:35,759
bubble hash into that bowl and stirring

58
00:02:33,299 --> 00:02:38,280
it around and he started noticing this

59
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:41,128
ring of oil on the outside of that

60
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,930
bubble hash and he was like huh that's

61
00:02:41,128 --> 00:02:44,908
interesting there's this separation and

62
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:47,370
so he started pulling that ring of oil

63
00:02:44,908 --> 00:02:50,310
with his dab or tool off of there and

64
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:52,469
back then it was knife hits and he

65
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:53,939
started taking that oil off and taking

66
00:02:52,469 --> 00:02:56,340
knife hits and noticing that there was a

67
00:02:53,939 --> 00:03:00,030
lot less residue and back then the term

68
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:03,090
full melt clear dome FM CD was a very

69
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:06,269
popular term for when we got bubble hash

70
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:07,950
or water hash so good and so clean that

71
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:11,759
it would bubble up and make these clear

72
00:03:07,949 --> 00:03:13,979
domes and basically burn to very little

73
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:17,608
if not no residue

74
00:03:13,979 --> 00:03:19,378
it wasn't until Chadwick compassion

75
00:03:17,609 --> 00:03:21,840
actually started playing with this

76
00:03:19,378 --> 00:03:23,578
technology of utilizing hot stainless

77
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,250
steel instruments and mechanically

78
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:29,579
separating the oils from the waxes that

79
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:32,519
he took this knife hit saw these clear

80
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:34,620
domes and saw zero residue and I really

81
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:38,129
want to say that that's where rosin

82
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:39,949
started but at that time there was no

83
00:03:38,128 --> 00:03:42,568
way to make that technology

84
00:03:39,949 --> 00:03:43,949
commercialized or scalable you know a

85
00:03:42,568 --> 00:03:45,719
lot of people in this industry talked

86
00:03:43,949 --> 00:03:48,269
about how is it scalable how do you

87
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:51,079
scale this technology and that's where a

88
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:53,639
lot of things are going and so you know

89
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:55,590
back then it was the hash makers treat

90
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:59,629
rosin started spreading that term you

91
00:03:55,590 --> 00:04:05,098
know this is back I want to say 2005

92
00:03:59,628 --> 00:04:09,179
maybe 2007 2007 I'm really bad with the

93
00:04:05,098 --> 00:04:11,969
actual date but this is pre dabbing you

94
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:14,729
know so back then it was the hash maker

95
00:04:11,969 --> 00:04:16,769
that got to keep that ring of oil for

96
00:04:14,729 --> 00:04:19,680
themselves you know rosin really wasn't

97
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:21,358
able to get out to the masses until

98
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,639
people like this gentleman came along

99
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:25,019
and I want to talk and I want him to

100
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:27,810
talk to you guys about

101
00:04:25,019 --> 00:04:30,478
what really pushed rosin to be scalable

102
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:32,959
initially what was the term that you

103
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:38,579
came up with and what were you doing

104
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:40,079
well I think I called it like solving

105
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:42,449
this hash sha sha

106
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:44,848
something like that but the way it

107
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:48,509
started I was just really really into

108
00:04:44,848 --> 00:04:49,949
making hash and you know all my melts

109
00:04:48,509 --> 00:04:52,650
and stuff and smoking it and then like

110
00:04:49,949 --> 00:04:54,660
it got to a point where I ran solo on

111
00:04:52,649 --> 00:04:57,810
what I had I didn't have any more of my

112
00:04:54,660 --> 00:05:00,990
harvest and I got solo on my melts I was

113
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:03,300
like literally trying to smoke like four

114
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:07,319
star three-and-a-half star like

115
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:09,389
low-quality melt hash so and I have to

116
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:11,009
give thanks to you because I remember

117
00:05:09,389 --> 00:05:13,348
seeing a tip on your page back then

118
00:05:11,009 --> 00:05:14,788
where I would take Milo my like my

119
00:05:13,348 --> 00:05:16,199
low-grade melts and put them between

120
00:05:14,788 --> 00:05:18,719
parchment I'd use a hair straightener

121
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:20,009
just to thin it out and it actually

122
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,669
helped I was able to get a better dab

123
00:05:20,009 --> 00:05:27,000
off low quality hash and you know I got

124
00:05:23,668 --> 00:05:28,079
tired of that and so I'm trying to

125
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,389
remember like exactly but

126
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:34,709
fast-forwarding you know past like

127
00:05:32,389 --> 00:05:35,908
flattening my hash out and like just

128
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:38,069
dabbing it like that getting to the

129
00:05:35,908 --> 00:05:41,788
point where I'm running out of my dabs

130
00:05:38,069 --> 00:05:45,689
so something went off in my head I

131
00:05:41,788 --> 00:05:46,079
remember just thinking like back okay

132
00:05:45,689 --> 00:05:47,788
okay

133
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:49,680
going back again okay I remember I

134
00:05:47,788 --> 00:05:52,468
messed up doing that I pressed it too

135
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,030
hard not in the hair straightener and I

136
00:05:52,468 --> 00:05:56,069
see it would be real shiny on the

137
00:05:54,029 --> 00:05:57,359
outside and dry in the middle and I

138
00:05:56,069 --> 00:05:59,189
wouldn't think anything of it I'd fold

139
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,629
it up do it again phone I used to do

140
00:05:59,189 --> 00:06:02,029
that like I'd fold it up like three

141
00:06:00,629 --> 00:06:04,829
times so it'd be nice and like

142
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:05,968
homogenized a nice good melt off of a

143
00:06:04,829 --> 00:06:08,788
low-quality hash you know what I mean

144
00:06:05,968 --> 00:06:10,769
the best you'd get off of it so light

145
00:06:08,788 --> 00:06:12,718
bulb goes off in my head I'm thinking

146
00:06:10,769 --> 00:06:14,939
back I remember that shininess I

147
00:06:12,718 --> 00:06:16,139
remember the dry so I didn't have a hair

148
00:06:14,939 --> 00:06:18,029
straightener laying there this is the

149
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:19,408
longest story possible of it but didn't

150
00:06:18,029 --> 00:06:22,408
have a hair straightener laying there so

151
00:06:19,408 --> 00:06:23,668
I actually took a chunk of hash between

152
00:06:22,408 --> 00:06:26,399
a piece of parchment shoved it up

153
00:06:23,668 --> 00:06:28,258
against the email with my finger and I'd

154
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:30,209
try not to burn myself or burn the paper

155
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:32,639
on the side of the coil and sure enough

156
00:06:30,209 --> 00:06:34,859
I pulled it off and there was oil like I

157
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,389
was hoping that would happen very little

158
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:38,278
not enough to dab so I kept doing it

159
00:06:36,389 --> 00:06:38,759
doing it doing it took me like five ten

160
00:06:38,278 --> 00:06:42,480
minutes

161
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:44,759
to get one dab hit it and sure enough my

162
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:46,800
father-in-law family was there nothing

163
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:49,019
it melted to nothing and it we were just

164
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,579
amazed so from there it would that's

165
00:06:49,019 --> 00:06:52,199
where it started that's where the Hat I

166
00:06:50,579 --> 00:06:54,509
would say that's where the rosin for me

167
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:56,670
started you know it started by a mistake

168
00:06:54,509 --> 00:07:00,240
that came back to me later on as an idea

169
00:06:56,670 --> 00:07:01,650
and I took it from there you know and so

170
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,120
I was I was pressing hash so it all

171
00:07:01,649 --> 00:07:04,889
started with hash for me no screen

172
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,840
screen wasn't any part of it at all so I

173
00:07:04,889 --> 00:07:08,490
was making low quality rosin still could

174
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:12,739
still small contaminants in it for the

175
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:16,259
most part it melted to nothing and so I

176
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:17,759
ran out of all my hash and we got to a

177
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:21,599
point you know we're just smoking bud so

178
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:23,009
Bing light bulb and I took a bud and I

179
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,330
did the same oh and actually when I was

180
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:26,819
pressing the hash my wife had come out

181
00:07:24,329 --> 00:07:29,099
and she brought me a hair straightener

182
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:30,990
cuz I had been using her hair curler and

183
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:32,730
so she swapped that out for me so boom I

184
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:35,220
get back to the out of the hash now I'm

185
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:38,550
at the weed I pressed a but I think it's

186
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:40,980
like 400 degrees super freakin hot so I

187
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:43,319
pressed it on the parchment and crazy

188
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:45,720
amount of oil came out of it like three

189
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:48,240
of us got a dab off of like a little

190
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:49,650
half gram bud so we were just amazed and

191
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,050
they just went non-stop from there like

192
00:07:49,649 --> 00:07:54,359
nights of just pressing out eighths

193
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:57,230
taking like five six hours just to press

194
00:07:54,360 --> 00:08:00,330
out an eighth on a hair straightener and

195
00:07:57,230 --> 00:08:03,210
that's where it took off and really I

196
00:08:00,329 --> 00:08:05,519
think that's where are all of our light

197
00:08:03,209 --> 00:08:07,560
bulbs turned on because we're like

198
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:10,229
that's where it's scalable this guy is

199
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:12,149
pressing flowers you know because before

200
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:14,370
we you know us hash makers we didn't

201
00:08:12,149 --> 00:08:16,500
want to press the best-quality hash you

202
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:17,970
know we've we got amazing quality hash

203
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,589
and we wanted to keep it as that you

204
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:21,420
know we might have started playing with

205
00:08:19,589 --> 00:08:23,489
a hair straightener to press it so that

206
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:26,040
we could dab it but we weren't anywhere

207
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:29,550
in the mindset of actually removing that

208
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:32,159
waxy cuticle until I feel like flour

209
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:33,539
rosin came about in that term I really

210
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,549
want to give credit to Phil over here

211
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:37,348
because I think that's what changed game

212
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:39,598
for a lot of people especially on the

213
00:08:37,349 --> 00:08:42,360
mast level because kids all over the

214
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:44,430
world had flour it was a lot harder for

215
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,870
them to come by amazing water hash but

216
00:08:44,429 --> 00:08:48,109
they had flour and they had a hair

217
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:51,269
straightener and that's what change game

218
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:52,060
at that time is when I really believe

219
00:08:51,269 --> 00:08:54,579
we're pushing

220
00:08:52,059 --> 00:08:56,589
towards you know safe extraction you

221
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:58,420
know everybody wanted to make oil we're

222
00:08:56,590 --> 00:09:00,220
all dabbers you know and when at a time

223
00:08:58,419 --> 00:09:01,629
when when solvent list was scarce and

224
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:03,879
when you'd get hash and it wouldn't melt

225
00:09:01,629 --> 00:09:05,740
it's just a disappointment it was hard

226
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:09,159
to come by six star five star even good

227
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:12,669
hash to even know what it was so I lost

228
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:14,490
my thought that hash split right before

229
00:09:12,669 --> 00:09:17,528
[Music]

230
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:19,360
but yeah going back to it you know we

231
00:09:17,528 --> 00:09:21,129
came from somewhere and I'm just gonna

232
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,019
give you guys a little recap right now

233
00:09:21,129 --> 00:09:24,700
we came from somewhere where we were

234
00:09:23,019 --> 00:09:27,309
watching forums of this guy named

235
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:29,490
compassion taking bubble hash and

236
00:09:27,309 --> 00:09:33,209
pushing it on some stainless steel bowl

237
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:37,240
to then playing with hair straighteners

238
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:40,870
to then pressing flour itself into flour

239
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:42,278
rosin and now look look where we've come

240
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:45,159
you know there's been so many different

241
00:09:42,278 --> 00:09:46,838
advances in technology since then this

242
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:49,719
man helped put out one of the very first

243
00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:51,700
rosin presses on the market there's been

244
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:54,430
so many other rosin presses since and

245
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:57,910
the technology just keeps changing and

246
00:09:54,429 --> 00:09:59,709
evolving and you know it's it's I think

247
00:09:57,909 --> 00:10:02,079
it's thanks to the education that we

248
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:03,879
started the open forum education style

249
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:05,980
that can fashion was pushing it on

250
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:09,220
originally that we've continued that

251
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:11,889
trend of really pushing education to our

252
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:13,870
peers to our community and it just

253
00:10:11,889 --> 00:10:16,088
continues to evolve into something that

254
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:18,159
I had never even imagined I grew up

255
00:10:16,089 --> 00:10:19,810
making bubble hash in my uncle's barn in

256
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:23,740
a hot barn and now we're actually

257
00:10:19,809 --> 00:10:25,919
separating THC their THC a you know on a

258
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:29,230
scientific level really we're seeing

259
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:31,419
99.9% THC a without the use of any

260
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:33,460
chemical solvent so it's really really

261
00:10:31,419 --> 00:10:37,539
really come a long way pickup everyone

262
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:40,030
that's involved in that movement we can

263
00:10:37,539 --> 00:10:43,029
talk about you know where it's going now

264
00:10:40,029 --> 00:10:45,069
so are you guys familiar with some of

265
00:10:43,029 --> 00:10:45,490
the new consistencies that we're seeing

266
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:47,350
out there

267
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:49,240
how many show hands out there in the

268
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:55,120
crowd how many of you guys have tried

269
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:58,600
rosin just rosin alright so when we

270
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:02,230
first started making rosin was really

271
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:04,330
when the consistency of earwax was

272
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:06,490
popular in the BHO world so I'm gonna

273
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:10,160
bring it back to like

274
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:10,850
2008/2009 and Pho had really just hit

275
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:13,610
the market

276
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:16,970
pho was called earwax back then so as us

277
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:18,860
hash makers started to make water hash

278
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:21,110
on a more controlled level a higher

279
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:23,990
level we wanted to mimic what was

280
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:26,449
happening in the BHO world so this is

281
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:28,009
pre rosin but we started making hash on

282
00:11:26,448 --> 00:11:30,620
a higher level where the hash was coming

283
00:11:28,009 --> 00:11:32,149
out gold rather than brown and it was

284
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:33,679
coming out smelling really like the

285
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:34,850
flour that it was come from because we

286
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:37,039
were controlling the variables of the

287
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:38,690
water the temperature of the water our

288
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:40,819
environment that we were making the hash

289
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:42,260
in and that starting material we started

290
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:43,579
really really paying attention to the

291
00:11:42,259 --> 00:11:45,679
starting material rather than using

292
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:47,208
stuff at uncle's farm that had been

293
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:48,888
sitting on the side of the road that he

294
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:50,778
didn't want on his property because that

295
00:11:48,889 --> 00:11:52,220
was more weight on his property that's

296
00:11:50,778 --> 00:11:54,259
what we were making bubble hash out of

297
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:56,480
initially up in Mendocino Humboldt

298
00:11:54,259 --> 00:11:58,879
County we started making bubble hash out

299
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,440
of close trim and not just the close

300
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:01,519
term mixed with all the fan leaf and

301
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:03,949
everything else they were throwing away

302
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:06,339
then we started making water hash out of

303
00:12:03,948 --> 00:12:08,750
fresh frozen material you know I think

304
00:12:06,339 --> 00:12:11,540
2008-2009 was when I first did my first

305
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:13,909
wash with fresh frozen material and at

306
00:12:11,539 --> 00:12:16,818
this point we're making water hash with

307
00:12:13,909 --> 00:12:18,259
whole plant fresh frozen material later

308
00:12:16,818 --> 00:12:20,208
on we're gonna talk about some of the

309
00:12:18,259 --> 00:12:22,490
amazing magicians in the crowd over here

310
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:25,039
that can make fire with dry trim it's

311
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:27,709
been sitting around but right now you

312
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:30,469
know the pinnacle of water hash is using

313
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:32,328
whole plant fresh frozen I'm jumping

314
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:35,449
around a little bit here but throw it

315
00:12:32,328 --> 00:12:38,629
back to that 2008-2009 generation when

316
00:12:35,448 --> 00:12:41,028
earwax was popular we start learning a

317
00:12:38,629 --> 00:12:43,789
little bit more and then chatter becomes

318
00:12:41,028 --> 00:12:47,120
extremely popular 2009 Colorado

319
00:12:43,789 --> 00:12:49,730
California 2010 and Shatter is the

320
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:52,399
consistency so we started wanting to

321
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:54,139
recreate that consistency of shatter so

322
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,629
we started heating up our hair

323
00:12:54,139 --> 00:12:58,850
straighteners a little bit hotter

324
00:12:56,629 --> 00:13:00,860
you know pressing in between parchment

325
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:02,709
paper just our water hash at a higher

326
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:06,009
temperature to create more stability

327
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:08,869
more of a clear see-through shatter

328
00:13:06,009 --> 00:13:11,389
consistency and I think that's another

329
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:15,110
one of the variables that pushed us as

330
00:13:11,389 --> 00:13:17,419
hash makers to find out what rosin was

331
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:18,610
we wanted more stability we're trying to

332
00:13:17,419 --> 00:13:21,549
create these consist

333
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:23,079
we were seeing in the BHO world but we

334
00:13:21,549 --> 00:13:26,109
weren't seeing as much stability if you

335
00:13:23,078 --> 00:13:28,239
just press hash at you know 200 250

336
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:30,490
degrees you're gonna see it turn into

337
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:33,190
shatter but eventually you're gonna see

338
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:35,320
it start to degrade turn darker butter

339
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:37,690
up some of those issues and it wasn't

340
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:41,050
until rosin came along and rosin the

341
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:43,660
actual art of rosin is removing the rest

342
00:13:41,049 --> 00:13:46,659
of that waxy cuticle if you look at

343
00:13:43,659 --> 00:13:49,149
cannabis cannabis you know is a plant

344
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:51,069
that has a lot of these shiny trichomes

345
00:13:49,149 --> 00:13:53,589
on the outside the crystals if you will

346
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:55,860
all plants have different structures of

347
00:13:53,589 --> 00:13:58,480
these crystals and as hash makers and

348
00:13:55,860 --> 00:14:00,278
specifically rosin makers we're learning

349
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,289
about this structure even more with

350
00:14:00,278 --> 00:14:05,409
every strain that we run some strains

351
00:14:02,289 --> 00:14:08,349
have that longer stalk with a very small

352
00:14:05,409 --> 00:14:10,539
head with a thick waxy cuticle and they

353
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:12,730
may not run as well in water hash they

354
00:14:10,539 --> 00:14:14,199
may not press as well in rosin you start

355
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:16,659
seeing some strains that have a thick

356
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:19,089
stalk in a really bulbous head with a

357
00:14:16,659 --> 00:14:21,039
thin waxy cuticle and you're seeing them

358
00:14:19,089 --> 00:14:24,010
run better in water hash you're seeing

359
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:25,448
the waxy cuticle effect the rosin less

360
00:14:24,009 --> 00:14:29,078
and you're seeing higher yields higher

361
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:30,278
potencies and so you know moving forward

362
00:14:29,078 --> 00:14:32,708
we started seeing these different

363
00:14:30,278 --> 00:14:35,470
consistencies like shatter like the ear

364
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:38,379
wax and then as we move we started

365
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:40,300
seeing this sauce consistency in the

366
00:14:38,379 --> 00:14:42,189
butane world where we were seeing a

367
00:14:40,299 --> 00:14:45,069
layer of terpenes on the outside and

368
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:47,699
it's pushed us rosin makers to continue

369
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:50,740
this movement and to continue trying to

370
00:14:47,698 --> 00:14:53,139
create a higher echelon for our industry

371
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:55,120
by pushing education and I think we've

372
00:14:53,139 --> 00:14:58,149
taught each other at this point that we

373
00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:00,009
can now separate THC a via different

374
00:14:58,149 --> 00:15:02,019
temperatures and different pressures to

375
00:15:00,009 --> 00:15:05,259
pull those terpenes and pull those the

376
00:15:02,019 --> 00:15:07,299
THC a separate that and now as we see

377
00:15:05,259 --> 00:15:09,698
these saucy and jammy consistencies in

378
00:15:07,299 --> 00:15:12,819
the BHO world we've been playing with

379
00:15:09,698 --> 00:15:15,009
pressure just like butane hash oil is

380
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:17,740
utilizing these columns

381
00:15:15,009 --> 00:15:19,778
basically to pull pressure and then keep

382
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:22,690
the butane and the trichomes under

383
00:15:19,778 --> 00:15:24,009
pressure creating separation we're now

384
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:25,839
seeing the same thing in the solvent

385
00:15:24,009 --> 00:15:27,490
list world some are calling it rosin jam

386
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:31,300
some are calling it solvent list sauce

387
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:32,259
but we're seeing these consistencies now

388
00:15:31,299 --> 00:15:35,139
via

389
00:15:32,259 --> 00:15:37,509
ultimately means and rosin so rosin

390
00:15:35,139 --> 00:15:40,119
history just continues as we see

391
00:15:37,509 --> 00:15:41,829
different consistencies as we see I feel

392
00:15:40,119 --> 00:15:45,548
like as we see now hydrocarbon guys

393
00:15:41,828 --> 00:15:48,399
starting to separate delta-9 and CBG and

394
00:15:45,548 --> 00:15:50,948
THC v that's all with pressure and

395
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:53,109
columns and temperature and so I think

396
00:15:50,948 --> 00:15:55,568
as we continue that might be some of

397
00:15:53,109 --> 00:15:58,629
what we see in the future as far as what

398
00:15:55,568 --> 00:15:59,228
rosin can really do you don't need a

399
00:15:58,629 --> 00:16:01,509
column

400
00:15:59,229 --> 00:16:03,129
you don't need heavy chemicals you don't

401
00:16:01,509 --> 00:16:04,538
need to possibly bro up blow up your

402
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:06,759
neighbor's house we're seeing all of

403
00:16:04,538 --> 00:16:07,808
these different consistencies via

404
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:11,019
solving this means

405
00:16:07,808 --> 00:16:14,769
thanks to rosin through the use of heat

406
00:16:11,019 --> 00:16:16,479
pressure and force right on I think that

407
00:16:14,769 --> 00:16:17,918
really kind of concludes it do we have

408
00:16:16,479 --> 00:16:20,049
any questions from the audience or

409
00:16:17,918 --> 00:16:23,068
anything else anybody think that rosin

410
00:16:20,048 --> 00:16:25,298
is going in another direction anybody

411
00:16:23,068 --> 00:16:27,099
disagree what what we talked about as

412
00:16:25,298 --> 00:16:29,139
far as the history of rosin it's a trip

413
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:32,288
how far we've come really this started

414
00:16:29,139 --> 00:16:34,509
what 10 12 years ago and now it's on the

415
00:16:32,288 --> 00:16:37,389
commercial market heavy I just actually

416
00:16:34,509 --> 00:16:39,369
came from cookies in Maywood and there

417
00:16:37,389 --> 00:16:40,869
was a ton of different rosin brands on

418
00:16:39,369 --> 00:16:43,028
the shelf and it was amazing to see it

419
00:16:40,869 --> 00:16:45,699
started 10 years ago but I'd say

420
00:16:43,028 --> 00:16:48,489
realistically it took off about five

421
00:16:45,698 --> 00:16:50,108
years ago when when the masses started

422
00:16:48,489 --> 00:16:52,239
to learn and do it themselves at home

423
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:54,309
and the more Minds that are able to

424
00:16:52,239 --> 00:16:56,319
focus and work on it and share the

425
00:16:54,308 --> 00:16:58,480
knowledge that they find that's why I

426
00:16:56,318 --> 00:17:00,428
think that's why we've quickly evolved

427
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,409
this technique you know compared to has

428
00:17:00,428 --> 00:17:05,048
been around forever and it's taken so

429
00:17:02,409 --> 00:17:07,750
long to get to where it is but you know

430
00:17:05,048 --> 00:17:10,898
with the butane extraction and with

431
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:13,568
everybody hands-on trying to do you know

432
00:17:10,898 --> 00:17:15,038
learn two new techniques and do the next

433
00:17:13,568 --> 00:17:16,869
best thing with solvent lists or with

434
00:17:15,038 --> 00:17:18,338
rosin I think that's where we're

435
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:20,109
breaking through and and I think you're

436
00:17:18,338 --> 00:17:21,308
right we're gonna find you know all

437
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:22,658
these different components we're going

438
00:17:21,308 --> 00:17:23,558
to be able to separate you know we're

439
00:17:22,659 --> 00:17:27,819
already at the point where we're

440
00:17:23,558 --> 00:17:30,460
separating THC and fats and terpenes so

441
00:17:27,818 --> 00:17:32,079
I think we're there it's pretty crazy to

442
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:33,490
see some of the hydrocarbon companies

443
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:34,990
switching over to solving this you know

444
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:36,759
that's that's where I feel like that's

445
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:38,558
when we made it you know like this

446
00:17:36,759 --> 00:17:39,849
education really did something we got

447
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:42,190
the guys that have been known for making

448
00:17:39,849 --> 00:17:43,839
butane making solvent list now that's

449
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:45,850
one of the cool things you know as of

450
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:47,409
January 1st 2019

451
00:17:45,849 --> 00:17:50,529
a lot of the new regulations came into

452
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:52,840
California and it was very difficult to

453
00:17:50,529 --> 00:17:54,460
just set up a closed-loop system get the

454
00:17:52,839 --> 00:17:56,798
fire department out there go through all

455
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:58,900
those regulations people are able to get

456
00:17:56,798 --> 00:18:02,288
to the end goal of a concentrate and a

457
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:03,700
nice healthy alternative right one

458
00:18:02,288 --> 00:18:05,950
regulations hit and some of the first

459
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:07,240
companies to come to shelf were rosin

460
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:09,548
companies or solving those companies

461
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:11,890
because it was a little bit easier to

462
00:18:09,548 --> 00:18:14,019
get manufacturing going licensing for

463
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:15,910
type six via type seven was a little bit

464
00:18:14,019 --> 00:18:17,410
easier to push through she didn't have

465
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:21,250
to deal with the fire burn nearly as

466
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:23,500
much still do but a lot of factors have

467
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:25,839
really really changed game I feel like

468
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:27,460
when we started putting solvent list

469
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:30,699
products or water hash products on the

470
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:34,750
shelves in Colorado back in 2009 we were

471
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:37,960
maybe 1 to 3% of the concentrate market

472
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:39,970
was water hash and at this point I think

473
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:41,769
we're definitely pushing 20% of the

474
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:43,450
concentrates especially in places like

475
00:18:41,769 --> 00:18:45,400
California and Colorado so big up

476
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:47,019
ourselves appreciate all the support and

477
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,669
keep pushing education for real that's

478
00:18:47,019 --> 00:18:50,079
what puts the products on the shelves

479
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:52,150
that are healthy that's what puts the

480
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:53,529
quality on the shelves and that's what

481
00:18:52,150 --> 00:19:11,500
helps the consumer understand what's

482
00:18:53,529 --> 00:19:13,329
good well I mean the perfect example is

483
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:15,970
the diamonds you know we kind of touched

484
00:19:13,329 --> 00:19:18,250
on it but I'll back it up a little bit

485
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:21,100
just in case anybody didn't catch that

486
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:22,990
one but in the hydrocarbon world right

487
00:19:21,099 --> 00:19:24,509
when we learned about roz in a year or

488
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:26,650
two into learning really about

489
00:19:24,509 --> 00:19:29,349
commercializing and scaling up the

490
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:32,470
creation of rosin we started seeing the

491
00:19:29,349 --> 00:19:34,959
butane guys make diamonds and we're like

492
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:37,210
oh we got to learn we got to step up our

493
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:39,038
game over here we're on shadow right now

494
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:40,990
you know we're starting to make this

495
00:19:39,038 --> 00:19:43,750
butter and these lighter consistencies

496
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:45,640
but diamonds oh how do we make this in

497
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:47,589
the lab how do we compete and really you

498
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,820
know it was all in playing with

499
00:19:47,589 --> 00:19:51,849
different temperatures different

500
00:19:48,819 --> 00:19:53,619
pressures different separations I feel

501
00:19:51,849 --> 00:19:55,839
like the first diamonds were not

502
00:19:53,619 --> 00:19:58,178
actually grown we're now seeing on the

503
00:19:55,839 --> 00:19:58,919
solvent side of things growing diamonds

504
00:19:58,179 --> 00:20:00,690
with pressure

505
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:02,130
but the first diamonds to come to the

506
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:04,890
industry were actually mechanically

507
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:07,170
separated amorphous solids morphus solid

508
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:08,460
crystalline yeah and you know I was

509
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:10,320
gonna bring it up a little earlier I

510
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:12,900
might have touched on the gentleman but

511
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:14,669
I have too big up a man named Jeff or

512
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:15,840
the cannabis Reverend this revenue

513
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:17,850
because of church

514
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:20,279
Jeff church cannabis Reverend was one of

515
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:23,339
the first gentlemen to bring in the

516
00:20:20,279 --> 00:20:26,009
actual micron screen to separate the

517
00:20:23,339 --> 00:20:29,339
oils from the waxes or what we later

518
00:20:26,009 --> 00:20:30,629
found out to be a lot of that THC a you

519
00:20:29,339 --> 00:20:32,519
know so that bag

520
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:34,500
not only contained a lot of the waxes

521
00:20:32,519 --> 00:20:37,170
but it also contained a lot of the THC a

522
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:39,329
so eventually we learned that pressing

523
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:41,490
at higher temperatures would completely

524
00:20:39,329 --> 00:20:43,079
remove the rest of the the terpenes and

525
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:44,640
actually are a lot of the rest of the

526
00:20:43,079 --> 00:20:47,339
cannabinoids and at those higher

527
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:50,880
temperatures we were just retaining THC

528
00:20:47,339 --> 00:20:53,939
a right and eventually we learned that

529
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:55,230
that white powdery substance was the THC

530
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:57,299
a that we are seeing some of these

531
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:59,430
hydrocarbon companies put out we started

532
00:20:57,299 --> 00:21:01,859
testing some of those that white powdery

533
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:05,970
substance and hitting anywhere from 94

534
00:21:01,859 --> 00:21:08,219
to 99% THC a in our regulated licensed

535
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:10,380
labs in Colorado and then we were like

536
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:13,350
whoa how do we turn this white powder

537
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:15,480
into what looks like the diamonds more

538
00:21:13,349 --> 00:21:17,759
heat and pressure so we brought the

539
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:19,170
temperature right back up to around 250

540
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:21,119
degrees people do it at different

541
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:25,620
temperatures but basically to melt that

542
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:28,769
white powder back down into a solid form

543
00:21:25,619 --> 00:21:31,169
and then you can mold that that form

544
00:21:28,769 --> 00:21:32,549
into whatever shape you want I think

545
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:35,400
when we first started doing it we were

546
00:21:32,549 --> 00:21:36,960
just making very very thick slabs so we

547
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:39,330
started with the white powder we heated

548
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:42,000
it up into these thicker slabs and we

549
00:21:39,329 --> 00:21:43,559
were smashing it in the lab and in our

550
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,089
parchment paper and it was basically

551
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:48,480
just making all different shapes and

552
00:21:45,089 --> 00:21:50,609
sizes of crystal and we started getting

553
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:53,759
that tested and even with that slight

554
00:21:50,609 --> 00:21:56,009
temperature up crease upwards at 250

555
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:59,059
degrees we were not seeing any THC a

556
00:21:56,009 --> 00:22:01,619
turn into THC which was interesting and

557
00:21:59,059 --> 00:22:06,059
our labs were telling us that it was

558
00:22:01,619 --> 00:22:07,409
pure 99.9 percent THC in fact some of

559
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:09,240
the labs that we were using not to put

560
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:11,220
anybody on blast some of the labs that

561
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:12,140
we were using for giving us test results

562
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:13,730
back at one

563
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:16,820
one hundred and eight point four percent

564
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:18,319
THC a so we had to step back and say

565
00:22:16,819 --> 00:22:19,519
okay we can't put this on the shelf that

566
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:21,470
doesn't make any sense you can't have

567
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:23,389
over a hundred percent what's happening

568
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:24,559
here and we contacted the lab they're

569
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:26,390
like well we've never seen anything that

570
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:28,429
high you know what's going on and we

571
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:29,750
started looking at the standards and you

572
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:33,440
know this is gonna be an ongoing issue

573
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:35,839
in newly regulated environments but one

574
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:37,549
of the standards came from res Tech and

575
00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:38,779
there's another standard that's put out

576
00:22:37,549 --> 00:22:40,609
with another company there's a few more

577
00:22:38,779 --> 00:22:43,009
companies that are putting out cannabis

578
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:45,289
standards now but res Tech Stander's

579
00:22:43,009 --> 00:22:47,329
range from like ninety seven to ninety

580
00:22:45,289 --> 00:22:49,609
eight point nine percent their THC a

581
00:22:47,329 --> 00:22:52,099
standard and when we turned in our THC a

582
00:22:49,609 --> 00:22:55,009
sample is higher than that so we bumped

583
00:22:52,099 --> 00:22:56,719
the scale and I feel like they have to

584
00:22:55,009 --> 00:22:58,430
create some new standards at this point

585
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,829
but we started leveling it out the lab

586
00:22:58,430 --> 00:23:03,200
started learning and we were

587
00:23:00,829 --> 00:23:05,349
mechanically separating THC a so to get

588
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:07,700
back to the original question

589
00:23:05,349 --> 00:23:09,379
mimicking these hydrocarbon guys you

590
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:11,779
know it started with the earwax we

591
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:13,340
created solvent less wax now the rosin

592
00:23:11,779 --> 00:23:15,920
has really really given us the advantage

593
00:23:13,339 --> 00:23:18,199
to recreate different consistencies

594
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:20,240
we're seeing in the hydrocarbon world we

595
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:22,220
saw diamonds become instantly popular

596
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:24,289
with butane extraction and propane

597
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:27,289
extraction few other methods to create

598
00:23:24,289 --> 00:23:29,269
diamonds and we had to find a way so we

599
00:23:27,289 --> 00:23:31,639
utilized heat pressure and mechanical

600
00:23:29,269 --> 00:23:33,799
separation how much a did you throw away

601
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:36,560
before you figured out that's the

602
00:23:33,799 --> 00:23:38,240
craziest thing yeah well luckily we were

603
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:40,579
actually using a lot of it in other

604
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:42,049
products topicals edibles and other

605
00:23:40,579 --> 00:23:44,089
things of that nature because we were

606
00:23:42,049 --> 00:23:46,129
seeing the test results in our coconut

607
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:47,659
oil and other things but we just didn't

608
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:49,430
put two and two together it's crazy to

609
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:51,980
think back on it but yeah we definitely

610
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:53,450
threw a lot away we definitely use some

611
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:55,789
for purposes that we shouldn't have been

612
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:57,529
using it for you know in mechanical

613
00:23:55,789 --> 00:23:59,779
separation I always like to talk about

614
00:23:57,529 --> 00:24:01,730
allocations and this is maybe something

615
00:23:59,779 --> 00:24:04,129
we can take a little break on but

616
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:06,380
allocations are extremely important and

617
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:07,850
that was one of those allocations we

618
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:10,550
were throwing away something that had a

619
00:24:07,849 --> 00:24:12,559
lot of value another allocation I talked

620
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:13,879
about is when we're especially when

621
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:15,919
we're talking about butane versus

622
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:18,710
solvent list I used the strain blue

623
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:20,960
dream for the perfect example you get a

624
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:22,700
full indoor operation of blue dream you

625
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,799
bring it into your lab and you've got

626
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:25,308
the hydrocarbon guys next door butane

627
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:27,109
extract

628
00:24:25,308 --> 00:24:29,119
guys and they're yielding 18 to 24

629
00:24:27,109 --> 00:24:30,709
percent on this blue dream you bring

630
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:33,018
that same exact blue dream into the

631
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:35,149
water hash lab we might be yielding

632
00:24:33,019 --> 00:24:36,798
three to five percent on that blue dream

633
00:24:35,148 --> 00:24:39,288
and originally I just started this

634
00:24:36,798 --> 00:24:41,628
discussion about the trichomes structure

635
00:24:39,288 --> 00:24:45,648
whether it has a thick waxy cuticle or a

636
00:24:41,628 --> 00:24:47,178
longer trichome stalk but blue dream is

637
00:24:45,648 --> 00:24:49,278
one of those ones that has a long stalk

638
00:24:47,179 --> 00:24:52,009
a very small head and a thick waxy

639
00:24:49,278 --> 00:24:54,440
cuticle it does not yield well in water

640
00:24:52,009 --> 00:24:56,749
hash and this is just an example you may

641
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:59,058
find the very specific cut that does do

642
00:24:56,749 --> 00:25:01,249
well in water hash but for general

643
00:24:59,058 --> 00:25:03,349
purposes aloft in times the blue dream

644
00:25:01,249 --> 00:25:05,240
that we see is just not good for

645
00:25:03,349 --> 00:25:07,128
allocating towards water hash it's great

646
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:09,259
for hydro carbon and so the same thing

647
00:25:07,128 --> 00:25:11,178
goes with allocations on the back end we

648
00:25:09,259 --> 00:25:12,980
found that that white powdery substance

649
00:25:11,179 --> 00:25:14,990
that we were taking away in our bags and

650
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:16,999
keeping the clean clear beautiful gold

651
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:19,849
rosin you know we were throwing that

652
00:25:16,999 --> 00:25:22,038
away as Phil mentioned and we've now

653
00:25:19,849 --> 00:25:25,128
learned to allocate that and utilize

654
00:25:22,038 --> 00:25:32,388
that THCA that we're thrown away any

655
00:25:25,128 --> 00:25:34,248
other questions we got lit up here so I

656
00:25:32,388 --> 00:25:37,158
don't all right so we're used to you

657
00:25:34,249 --> 00:25:39,288
know the full spectrum like 45min 160th

658
00:25:37,159 --> 00:25:42,379
you guys to play with like the 1/16 plus

659
00:25:39,288 --> 00:25:44,298
for separation because you know I I

660
00:25:42,378 --> 00:25:45,638
found some light goods you know find

661
00:25:44,298 --> 00:25:47,499
some good heads in the ones

662
00:25:45,638 --> 00:25:49,718
bigger heads who beat our dicks have you

663
00:25:47,499 --> 00:25:54,038
guys tried explored that so you're

664
00:25:49,719 --> 00:25:57,909
saying you know do we basically isolate

665
00:25:54,038 --> 00:25:59,618
the 160-180 micron and you know press

666
00:25:57,909 --> 00:26:01,959
that out and see the quality of that

667
00:25:59,618 --> 00:26:04,868
rosin and do stuff like that or separate

668
00:26:01,959 --> 00:26:06,849
or keep it like yeah I mean personally

669
00:26:04,868 --> 00:26:09,488
yeah I've actually just recently I mean

670
00:26:06,848 --> 00:26:13,178
it was some indoor but it was isolated

671
00:26:09,489 --> 00:26:15,639
180 micron from an OG which is to me not

672
00:26:13,179 --> 00:26:20,169
a common thing to find for ice water

673
00:26:15,638 --> 00:26:24,728
hash a 180 you and it was incredible it

674
00:26:20,169 --> 00:26:27,249
actually put out about 91% return on the

675
00:26:24,729 --> 00:26:30,159
rosin so it was the most most impressive

676
00:26:27,249 --> 00:26:31,690
180 I've ever seen when he talked about

677
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:33,459
that return on the rosies talking about

678
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:34,808
the actual trichome head being pressed

679
00:26:33,459 --> 00:26:37,899
into rosin and when you're talking about

680
00:26:34,808 --> 00:26:40,808
a 91% return that means there's barely

681
00:26:37,898 --> 00:26:42,968
any waxy cuticle it means you're barely

682
00:26:40,808 --> 00:26:45,190
losing anything you start with 5 grams

683
00:26:42,969 --> 00:26:47,200
and you're yielding about four point two

684
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:48,759
four point five or four point six grams

685
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,499
now I'm horrible with mass start with

686
00:26:48,759 --> 00:26:55,509
the gram and you know you're getting 0.9

687
00:26:50,499 --> 00:26:57,940
one bag there you go but but yeah I mean

688
00:26:55,509 --> 00:27:00,669
for the most part a lot of strains I do

689
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:02,919
I like the 180 I like the 150 I think it

690
00:27:00,669 --> 00:27:05,440
really depends on your methods

691
00:27:02,919 --> 00:27:06,940
you know gentle agitation depending on

692
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,649
strains and knowing what you're working

693
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:10,989
with the environment you're working in

694
00:27:08,648 --> 00:27:13,778
and controlling all your variables

695
00:27:10,989 --> 00:27:16,298
I think the 180 and the 150 are really

696
00:27:13,778 --> 00:27:18,729
good because for the most part I usually

697
00:27:16,298 --> 00:27:20,950
isolate everything depending on what I'm

698
00:27:18,729 --> 00:27:22,209
doing but I find in the end a lot of

699
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:23,739
things end up just making it into the

700
00:27:22,209 --> 00:27:25,659
same batch because what I'll do is I'll

701
00:27:23,739 --> 00:27:26,950
isolate and then you know I'll press

702
00:27:25,659 --> 00:27:29,619
everything out and I'll separate

703
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:31,179
everything by quality you know so not

704
00:27:29,618 --> 00:27:33,939
quality just by color but call you by

705
00:27:31,179 --> 00:27:34,809
terpene profile always have to dab it

706
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:36,759
taste

707
00:27:34,808 --> 00:27:38,168
I noticed the 40 the 40 micron is

708
00:27:36,759 --> 00:27:40,659
usually not my favorite I like to keep

709
00:27:38,169 --> 00:27:42,070
that little separate because I don't

710
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:43,450
know if it's more fats and lipids that

711
00:27:42,069 --> 00:27:45,700
are in it that's giving it a certain

712
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:47,639
taste but I mean it's still great oil

713
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:50,649
but to me I think keeping the 40

714
00:27:47,638 --> 00:27:52,449
separated is better than keeping the 180

715
00:27:50,648 --> 00:27:55,358
and the 150 separated because to me the

716
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:56,919
180 and the 150 have a high terpene

717
00:27:55,358 --> 00:27:59,199
profile to me those have like my

718
00:27:56,919 --> 00:28:03,028
favorite terms you know like if you

719
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:06,159
never catch 150 or 180 those are just

720
00:28:03,028 --> 00:28:08,859
man lucky and to really you know

721
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:10,750
summarize that it's so strained

722
00:28:08,859 --> 00:28:12,548
dependent you know I was actually

723
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:15,460
speaking of your og cush that you'll did

724
00:28:12,548 --> 00:28:19,778
amazing in your 180 bag we ran some

725
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:21,130
lemon cush Himalayan lemon cush it was a

726
00:28:19,778 --> 00:28:23,109
strain that was brought back by a

727
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:27,429
soldier friend of ours that we ran in

728
00:28:23,109 --> 00:28:30,428
Colorado for a long time this one round

729
00:28:27,429 --> 00:28:33,720
that one of my growers grew wielded over

730
00:28:30,429 --> 00:28:34,899
two ounces of full melt in the 220 bag

731
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:37,690
okay

732
00:28:34,898 --> 00:28:39,329
so anything's possible and to go back on

733
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:42,009
what Phil said I really like to

734
00:28:39,329 --> 00:28:44,168
emphasize that we actually do the same

735
00:28:42,009 --> 00:28:47,440
thing we separate all of the microns

736
00:28:44,169 --> 00:28:48,788
I run a couple 220 bags we actually run

737
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,200
a couple there and in the washing

738
00:28:48,788 --> 00:28:53,288
machine just to make sure we've gotten

739
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:58,509
all that plant material I then run a 185

740
00:28:53,288 --> 00:29:01,058
a 160 a 120 you know sometimes the

741
00:28:58,509 --> 00:29:03,398
hundred the 90 that you know sometimes

742
00:29:01,058 --> 00:29:05,500
to run a strain that we've never ran

743
00:29:03,398 --> 00:29:07,058
before I'll put all my bags in there

744
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:09,638
I'll try and separate as many as I can

745
00:29:07,058 --> 00:29:11,079
because each strain each grower each

746
00:29:09,638 --> 00:29:13,750
medium is gonna be a little different

747
00:29:11,079 --> 00:29:15,759
even from one row you know you might be

748
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:18,669
running the same strain in a grow house

749
00:29:15,759 --> 00:29:20,079
but have LEDs in one row have your HPS

750
00:29:18,669 --> 00:29:22,509
and another you're gonna see differences

751
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:24,908
even there's differences from the top of

752
00:29:22,509 --> 00:29:26,888
your plant to the bottom of the plant as

753
00:29:24,909 --> 00:29:28,870
far as the trichome formation the amount

754
00:29:26,888 --> 00:29:31,000
of oils in them the size of the trichome

755
00:29:28,869 --> 00:29:32,528
head so we really like to especially

756
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,119
when we're running a strain that we

757
00:29:32,528 --> 00:29:36,339
haven't run before is run all of those

758
00:29:34,119 --> 00:29:38,648
different micron sizes you can combine

759
00:29:36,339 --> 00:29:40,750
them in the end I can't combine them you

760
00:29:38,648 --> 00:29:42,759
know if you've started with only three

761
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:44,740
three microns you can't separate them

762
00:29:42,759 --> 00:29:47,230
sorry beforehand so we like to start out

763
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:49,179
with as many bags as we can see where

764
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:51,009
the heads are lying and then eventually

765
00:29:49,179 --> 00:29:52,509
on that next run when you're running

766
00:29:51,009 --> 00:29:54,009
that same material from that same garden

767
00:29:52,509 --> 00:29:55,898
you can remove some bags you don't have

768
00:29:54,009 --> 00:29:59,079
to use all those bags and I think right

769
00:29:55,898 --> 00:30:01,658
there I think what that is in my opinion

770
00:29:59,079 --> 00:30:04,178
is every strain has a different head and

771
00:30:01,659 --> 00:30:05,830
tell you know so it's like the heads the

772
00:30:04,179 --> 00:30:08,200
cream and the tail is gonna be your butt

773
00:30:05,829 --> 00:30:09,908
end it might be it's lower quality you

774
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:11,169
know but for the most part when you see

775
00:30:09,909 --> 00:30:12,460
the head and tail together like a

776
00:30:11,169 --> 00:30:14,650
full-spectrum hash oil

777
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:16,809
something it's a good product but when

778
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:18,900
you actually pull that tail end out of

779
00:30:16,809 --> 00:30:21,369
like let's just say for instance a

780
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:23,710
headband we're running and that you know

781
00:30:21,369 --> 00:30:25,599
you can run seven eight spins you know

782
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:28,660
30-minute spins and you're still pulling

783
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:30,399
and you know five spins in it was just

784
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:32,800
quality but you can see it's getting

785
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:34,330
darker more contaminants but then you

786
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:35,769
get to the rosin and you're pressing

787
00:30:34,329 --> 00:30:37,659
everything out and everything's just

788
00:30:35,769 --> 00:30:39,789
coming out gold regardless of the hash

789
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:42,009
you know and and you know it's all about

790
00:30:39,789 --> 00:30:44,680
the yield so you got a hundred grams of

791
00:30:42,009 --> 00:30:47,200
high-quality and 10 grams of just some

792
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:49,210
darker oil other strains you know you'll

793
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:51,220
notice regardless of the yield you might

794
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:53,440
got the same yield off that strain as

795
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:55,750
far as hash but it comes to pressing you

796
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:58,059
know you have more wax membrane to those

797
00:30:55,750 --> 00:31:00,519
heads so therefore you're getting more

798
00:30:58,059 --> 00:31:01,659
more tail in with that head so you know

799
00:31:00,519 --> 00:31:04,599
you're get looking at like let's just

800
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:06,460
say you get 80 grams and 30 grams of

801
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:07,779
tail in because that's the darker oil

802
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:09,430
yeah and that's that's more when you're

803
00:31:07,779 --> 00:31:11,019
looking for like when people are

804
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:14,710
separating their Roslin's you know

805
00:31:11,019 --> 00:31:17,769
having like you know their their heads -

806
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:19,569
and then just the edible grade for me I

807
00:31:17,769 --> 00:31:21,039
kind of I'm more of a full spec guy I

808
00:31:19,569 --> 00:31:23,500
kind of like to keep everything together

809
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:24,909
as long I like to keep the tail end out

810
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:26,230
and I think that's an important part of

811
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:28,870
extraction is the head and tell

812
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:31,210
regardless of what we're doing rosin ice

813
00:31:28,869 --> 00:31:33,579
water extraction ahead and tell it's all

814
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:41,079
about knowing when to poll and what to

815
00:31:33,579 --> 00:31:43,389
keep separated a mature grower as

816
00:31:41,079 --> 00:31:47,059
anybody here ever explored with

817
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:52,640
ultrasonic cleaning for washing hash

818
00:31:47,059 --> 00:31:54,319
like definitely actually we've yeah the

819
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:56,350
question is has anybody utilized

820
00:31:54,319 --> 00:31:59,059
ultrasonic cleaning with hash or

821
00:31:56,349 --> 00:32:01,309
ultrasonic technology and we've used on

822
00:31:59,059 --> 00:32:02,869
actually a number of scales and people

823
00:32:01,309 --> 00:32:06,049
companies that I know right now are

824
00:32:02,869 --> 00:32:08,269
utilizing that technology in a number of

825
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:13,190
ways as well I'll touch on a few things

826
00:32:08,269 --> 00:32:14,389
we had a company come in to our facility

827
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:16,039
we were one of the first licensed

828
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:18,560
facility blessed to be one of the first

829
00:32:16,039 --> 00:32:21,349
licensed facility in the world in

830
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:23,089
Colorado and so a lot of companies from

831
00:32:21,349 --> 00:32:24,889
the cold brew industry from the wine

832
00:32:23,089 --> 00:32:26,949
industry beer industry started

833
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:31,490
contacting us because we were able to do

834
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:34,130
license protected R&amp;D and an ultrasonic

835
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:37,009
agitation company or cavitation company

836
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:39,110
similar technology contacted us from the

837
00:32:37,009 --> 00:32:41,839
cold brew industry and brought in

838
00:32:39,109 --> 00:32:43,539
machinery into our facility and we

839
00:32:41,839 --> 00:32:46,009
started playing around with it

840
00:32:43,539 --> 00:32:49,789
unfortunately cannabis is a lot

841
00:32:46,009 --> 00:32:52,579
different than coffee and hops etc and

842
00:32:49,789 --> 00:32:55,190
we just kept having clogging issues with

843
00:32:52,579 --> 00:32:58,009
that machine but I saw value in it so

844
00:32:55,190 --> 00:33:00,110
what we did use utilize that cavitation

845
00:32:58,009 --> 00:33:01,940
or that ultrasonic technology not to

846
00:33:00,109 --> 00:33:03,709
separate the heads from the material

847
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:05,630
like we initially wanted to and I still

848
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:07,340
do think that there's value there and I

849
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:09,710
think that there is viability and I

850
00:33:07,339 --> 00:33:12,019
think that you could do that but instead

851
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:13,670
we ended up because it costs so much

852
00:33:12,019 --> 00:33:15,259
money for the machinery and to keep

853
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:17,000
making these diodes bigger and these

854
00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:18,799
passageways bigger because the cannabis

855
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,119
had to flow but we wanted to get an

856
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:22,460
exact temperature there were a lot of

857
00:33:20,119 --> 00:33:24,589
variables that cost a lot millions of

858
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:26,090
dollars really in R&amp;D that this

859
00:33:24,589 --> 00:33:28,309
cavitation company didn't want to just

860
00:33:26,089 --> 00:33:30,799
keep shelling out but we ended up

861
00:33:28,309 --> 00:33:33,049
finding out that on a very high level

862
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:34,549
turning up that cavitation device that

863
00:33:33,049 --> 00:33:37,309
ultrasonic device we're able to actually

864
00:33:34,549 --> 00:33:40,970
fully homogenize the oil into the

865
00:33:37,309 --> 00:33:43,250
solution so for edible products for

866
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:46,130
topical products there's a lot of value

867
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:48,079
in ultrasonic agitation and cavitation I

868
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:51,230
still do think there's value in

869
00:33:48,079 --> 00:33:53,750
separating the oil via this technology

870
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:57,019
if you guys aren't familiar basically

871
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:59,720
ultrasonic agitation is a wave that is

872
00:33:57,019 --> 00:34:00,889
so intense that it can actually separate

873
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:03,558
oil from wall

874
00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:05,900
they've used it in actually separating

875
00:34:03,558 --> 00:34:09,889
rivers and things of that nature on a

876
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:12,648
larger scale ie cavitation but we saw

877
00:34:09,889 --> 00:34:15,590
this value because we started turning it

878
00:34:12,648 --> 00:34:17,418
up and actually breaking the trichome

879
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:20,539
heads in water which would be our

880
00:34:17,418 --> 00:34:23,239
solution and now we have oil and water

881
00:34:20,539 --> 00:34:25,219
in one solution we started going back to

882
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:26,898
okay how do they get oil out of water

883
00:34:25,219 --> 00:34:28,099
and you know we started playing with

884
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:30,079
some of the technology that they're

885
00:34:28,099 --> 00:34:33,230
using in the oceans to get you know

886
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:35,329
spills out of the oceans these polymer

887
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:36,740
tubes basically that run on the bottom

888
00:34:35,329 --> 00:34:38,779
of the ocean that are pulling the oil

889
00:34:36,739 --> 00:34:40,039
out of the ocean and we played with that

890
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:42,139
but we weren't seeing the yields we

891
00:34:40,039 --> 00:34:43,909
wanted to see I still do think that

892
00:34:42,139 --> 00:34:45,858
there's a lot to do there and there is a

893
00:34:43,909 --> 00:34:47,599
future for it so keep playing that's

894
00:34:45,858 --> 00:34:49,668
what it's all about I didn't get to it I

895
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:52,210
didn't get there yet myself but I think

896
00:34:49,668 --> 00:34:52,210
one of y'all could

897
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:03,460
share share share with everyone put it

898
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:06,789
up on the forums throw it up on

899
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:13,809
Instagram tag these guys they'll put it

900
00:35:06,789 --> 00:35:15,489
out there that's what it's about man

901
00:35:13,809 --> 00:35:18,759
that's what it's about we found each

902
00:35:15,489 --> 00:35:21,759
other somehow we found compassion both

903
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:24,010
both of us found compassion so keep

904
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:25,000
spreading knowledge for real and stick

905
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:26,380
around today because I think we

906
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,269
definitely have some more discussions a

907
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:30,849
little roundtable with a few more hash

908
00:35:28,269 --> 00:35:32,469
makers in the building but we're gonna

909
00:35:30,849 --> 00:35:34,829
take a little split break I think right

910
00:35:32,469 --> 00:35:34,829
about now
