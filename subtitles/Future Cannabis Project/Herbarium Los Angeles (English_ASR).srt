1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,059
[Music]

2
00:00:10,699 --> 00:00:21,320
we have eight separate licenses so the

3
00:00:17,429 --> 00:00:30,299
story of our license we got it back in

4
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:33,359
2009 um my father purchased it my name

5
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:37,140
is Adam iary I'm the owner of herbarium

6
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:42,238
and the way we got our license was back

7
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:43,739
in 2009 we purchased a pre ICO from one

8
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:47,549
of our partners who's actually still

9
00:00:43,738 --> 00:00:54,750
with us today and we didn't use the

10
00:00:47,549 --> 00:00:58,649
license until about 2017 when cannabis

11
00:00:54,750 --> 00:01:01,429
first became legal we went through some

12
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:03,750
legal battles but in the end we won and

13
00:01:01,429 --> 00:01:07,500
herbarium was born when you say legal

14
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:11,909
battles like yeah the cannabis industry

15
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:13,859
has always been very messy yeah you know

16
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:15,840
people claiming that they owned a pre

17
00:01:13,859 --> 00:01:17,368
ICO when they did in people claiming

18
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,219
that they had licenses that they never

19
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:22,349
had yeah so it's not using ours for a

20
00:01:20,219 --> 00:01:25,109
long time some people thought that they

21
00:01:22,349 --> 00:01:26,819
could use it because it was I said you

22
00:01:25,109 --> 00:01:33,629
know basically Idol there was a lot of

23
00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:36,179
trafficking in licensing yeah yeah I

24
00:01:33,629 --> 00:01:37,828
actually I'm sure there's a ton of

25
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:39,329
lawsuits going on right now over these

26
00:01:37,828 --> 00:01:41,759
licenses because they're worth so much

27
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:43,889
more money now and you know a lot of

28
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,530
people that were the pioneers of this

29
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:50,790
industry they weren't familiar with you

30
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:53,790
know legal legal rights or the laws or

31
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:55,950
how to conduct a proper business so all

32
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:58,618
they did was basically open up these pre

33
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:00,540
icos and try to run a dispensary and

34
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:02,250
that's as far as they understood

35
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:04,259
so these lawsuits are just like in

36
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,650
addition to the lawsuits like against

37
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:07,109
past

38
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:08,969
being of the city lawsuit very likely

39
00:02:07,109 --> 00:02:10,530
I'm not familiar with Pasadena but I'm

40
00:02:08,969 --> 00:02:13,169
sure they are I mean I know the city of

41
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:15,390
Los Angeles yeah same thing is Los

42
00:02:13,169 --> 00:02:18,839
Angeles they were sued by tons of

43
00:02:15,389 --> 00:02:27,239
dispensaries back in 2017 so there's

44
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:29,670
like a line with people suing them two

45
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:35,939
three opening is three a third one

46
00:02:29,669 --> 00:02:51,359

across distribution many father you sit

131
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:49,310
here when I was 18 or 19 my father

132
00:08:45,828 --> 00:08:55,458
bought this license under my name and we

133
00:08:49,309 --> 00:09:00,018
didn't touch it 28 so 10 years 10 years

134
00:08:55,458 --> 00:09:01,939
ago I was more focused on fashion I came

135
00:09:00,019 --> 00:09:05,539
from a family that had fashion

136
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:08,120
businesses and at the time I had a

137
00:09:05,539 --> 00:09:10,969
fashion website after as soon as

138
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:13,519
cannabis became legal we decided to you

139
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:15,589
know get back in it and we found out

140
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:18,440
that someone was using our licence so we

141
00:09:15,589 --> 00:09:19,010
were in court for two years over it we

142
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:22,459
ended up winning

143
00:09:19,009 --> 00:09:36,230
we found this location with 14 days left

144
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:39,619
for the deadline yeah this was us a

145
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:42,170
diamond in the Nova song it was called

146
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:44,810
herbarium it was it it was a dispensary

147
00:09:42,169 --> 00:09:46,519
that did not have a license so they had

148
00:09:44,809 --> 00:09:49,069
to shut down they were closed for about

149
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:51,409
a year and before they were dispensary

150
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:53,089
there was another dispensary it's always

151
00:09:51,409 --> 00:09:58,129
been a dispensary that just kept opening

152
00:09:53,089 --> 00:10:01,010
and closing because of licenses so yeah

153
00:09:58,129 --> 00:10:04,070
so when we first got the store I was

154
00:10:01,009 --> 00:10:05,990
thinking of names to give it and I

155
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:08,899
didn't know exactly what's what to call

156
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:13,549
it you know but I didn't want to call it

157
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:14,990
or bury him and one day while we're you

158
00:10:13,549 --> 00:10:17,328
know just setting things up in the shop

159
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:18,279
a customer walks in and she's like is

160
00:10:17,328 --> 00:10:19,750
this her barrier

161
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:21,939
you know I don't know if you guys are

162
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:24,789
open or not but I just wanted to say

163
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:28,410
that this place saved my life yeah she's

164
00:10:24,789 --> 00:10:31,959
like I had you know stage 4 cancer and

165
00:10:28,409 --> 00:10:35,949
the edibles I was taking by Korova they

166
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:37,540
saved my life so I hope you guys come

167
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:39,310
back I can't wait for you guys to come

168
00:10:37,539 --> 00:10:41,259
back thank you for everything you've

169
00:10:39,309 --> 00:10:44,169
done and I was like you know what this

170
00:10:41,259 --> 00:10:46,539
is more than just a store you know I

171
00:10:44,169 --> 00:10:49,839
thought when I first took over that it

172
00:10:46,539 --> 00:10:51,610
was you know a store and we people would

173
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:54,129
come if you built it but I realized that

174
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:56,860
it already had a community you know it

175
00:10:54,129 --> 00:11:14,889
already had a belief behind it that

176
00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:17,680
people knew about and it helped so

177
00:11:14,889 --> 00:11:19,779
everyone was yeah and that was your

178
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:24,099
relation I still sometimes save the word

179
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:25,539
patron but yes and as soon as we and

180
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,129
then I I was like you know what let me

181
00:11:25,539 --> 00:11:28,419
do some research and then I just thought

182
00:11:27,129 --> 00:11:31,149
of the name thought of the name and then

183
00:11:28,419 --> 00:11:33,309
I one day I just fell in love with it I

184
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:35,039
was like you know what it's perfect it's

185
00:11:33,309 --> 00:11:38,619
it's not a little bit hard to pronounce

186
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:42,189
it's a you know bold name it's a unique

187
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:44,919
name and no one uses then the definition

188
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:47,589
behind it is basically a Museum of dried

189
00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:50,649
plants so I was like you know what it's

190
00:11:47,589 --> 00:11:53,550
perfect it works yeah it was perfect and

191
00:11:50,649 --> 00:11:56,230
then everything else came after that so

192
00:11:53,549 --> 00:11:59,500
our other shop is in needles and it's

193
00:11:56,230 --> 00:12:01,210
called herbarium 66 well actually now

194
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,350
that I think about it you've gone whole

195
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:04,990
hog with the herbarium

196
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:07,089
everything's branded or berry oh no you

197
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:12,279
don't pronounce the eighth right and

198
00:12:07,089 --> 00:12:15,190
then say your barium yeah so talk to me

199
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:15,850
a little bit about like the like retail

200
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:18,670
right

201
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:22,269
and the competition and and what's that

202
00:12:18,669 --> 00:12:24,068
like now in in cannabis retail it like

203
00:12:22,269 --> 00:12:25,600
it's specific to Los Angeles right now

204
00:12:24,068 --> 00:12:27,549
because that's where we are like what

205
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,560
are your challenges and you know we've

206
00:12:27,549 --> 00:12:32,289
heard some people are also charging what

207
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:33,698
they call them a sliding do you know

208
00:12:32,289 --> 00:12:36,549
there's all kinds of things going on

209
00:12:33,698 --> 00:12:42,419
what are you saying what are you saying

210
00:12:36,549 --> 00:12:46,409
so there there's a lot of different

211
00:12:42,419 --> 00:12:51,120
thing channels to this but I would say I

212
00:12:46,409 --> 00:12:54,189
don't believe that I have competition I

213
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:57,299
think that if you do what you believe in

214
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:59,860
and that's your Rao and that's your goal

215
00:12:57,299 --> 00:13:01,359
either people love your brand or they

216
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:03,669
don't love your brand but if people

217
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:06,278
believe in what you believe in they will

218
00:13:03,669 --> 00:13:09,068
come you know any dispenser you can go

219
00:13:06,278 --> 00:13:12,789
and sell blue dream any dispensary can

220
00:13:09,068 --> 00:13:17,799
go and sell a select cartridge right or

221
00:13:12,789 --> 00:13:19,990
a any edible any any flower anyone can

222
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:23,049
sell it right but why would they come to

223
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:25,839
your dispensary to purchase it and

224
00:13:23,049 --> 00:13:28,688
that's where I think is where a lot of

225
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:30,399
people fall off and a lot of and it's I

226
00:13:28,688 --> 00:13:33,730
think it separates that the beginners

227
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:35,948
from the believers you know and when

228
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:37,539
that happens you don't you know if

229
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:40,318
someone still Shops at another store

230
00:13:37,539 --> 00:13:43,028
good for you I'm happy for you

231
00:13:40,318 --> 00:13:45,088
which brings me to my next thing another

232
00:13:43,028 --> 00:13:50,139
challenge the next challenge is

233
00:13:45,089 --> 00:13:54,370
consistency a lot of these brands and

234
00:13:50,139 --> 00:13:56,889
companies lack consistency so it's a

235
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:59,289
challenge for all dispensaries to be

236
00:13:56,889 --> 00:14:02,709
able to always have a consistent product

237
00:13:59,289 --> 00:14:05,289
flight some sometimes there's drought

238
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:07,088
sometimes there's shortages sometimes

239
00:14:05,289 --> 00:14:08,740
people will say they're delivering and

240
00:14:07,089 --> 00:14:10,870
they never deliver some people don't

241
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:14,948
know how to do accounting so it's all

242
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:18,959
types of different issues that we're

243
00:14:14,948 --> 00:14:23,919
slowly trying to maneuver through that

244
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:27,188
you know makes it difficult for yourself

245
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:29,429
to grow you know so I don't look at

246
00:14:27,188 --> 00:14:31,829
other dispensaries

247
00:14:29,429 --> 00:14:34,019
petition because if someone shops

248
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:35,670
they're good for them and maybe they

249
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:38,069
have a product that I don't have that

250
00:14:35,669 --> 00:14:39,569
there they really need and that's the

251
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:40,740
issue with consistency when you want to

252
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:55,890
carry a product that you can't

253
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:58,169
necessarily have so yeah are we yes

254
00:14:55,889 --> 00:15:04,230
that's what I look at it as definitely

255
00:14:58,169 --> 00:15:07,379
getting better yes providing our service

256
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:10,528
is consistent hours our selection stays

257
00:15:07,379 --> 00:15:15,629
consistent but to have a consistent flow

258
00:15:10,528 --> 00:15:16,889
of a specific product is difficult you

259
00:15:15,629 --> 00:15:19,409
know there will be people that say they

260
00:15:16,889 --> 00:15:21,778
have which is an example blue dreams

261
00:15:19,409 --> 00:15:23,159
right and then they sell out of their

262
00:15:21,778 --> 00:15:23,990
blue dream and they don't have it for a

263
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:27,449
couple months

264
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:34,230
this is kiya this is another dog okay

265
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:36,509
this is a we have a lot of dogs so yeah

266
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:43,680
that that's one of them now in regards

267
00:15:36,509 --> 00:15:48,120
to slotting fees the way slotting fees

268
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:52,259
are approached are taken the wrong way

269
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:55,889
by a lot of brands personally as someone

270
00:15:52,259 --> 00:15:58,909
who also distributes I look at a

271
00:15:55,889 --> 00:16:01,919
slotting fee as I should do it

272
00:15:58,909 --> 00:16:03,719
if I'm a brand and I want to be in a

273
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:07,049
dispensary I should do it

274
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:09,920
there's an issue we have a hundred

275
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:14,909
thousand different brands in the market

276
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:17,639
but only 180 dispensaries right now

277
00:16:14,909 --> 00:16:19,949
these brands are coming in and their

278
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:21,870
margins are insane they're charging

279
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:24,509
twenty five dollars for a full gram

280
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:26,519
cartridge for a dispensary to sell it to

281
00:16:24,509 --> 00:16:27,990
their custom to our customer for almost

282
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:32,789
seventy five dollars out the door after

283
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:35,190
tax you know so their margin what

284
00:16:32,789 --> 00:16:37,528
they're doing is charging a high margin

285
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:41,059
to a dispensary when the dispensary is

286
00:16:37,528 --> 00:16:42,318
the niche not the distributor there's a

287
00:16:41,058 --> 00:16:43,908
ton of distributors there's only a

288
00:16:42,318 --> 00:16:46,608
hundred and eighty licensed stores right

289
00:16:43,908 --> 00:16:48,528
now more opening but you know there's

290
00:16:46,609 --> 00:16:52,069
there's less stores than there are

291
00:16:48,528 --> 00:16:55,338
distributors right so to be able to put

292
00:16:52,068 --> 00:16:59,088
to be able to price gouge to me as a

293
00:16:55,339 --> 00:17:01,549
distributor is not okay and the way that

294
00:16:59,089 --> 00:17:04,100
we look at it isn't as a shelving fee or

295
00:17:01,548 --> 00:17:08,058
charging to be in the way we look at it

296
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:10,308
is twenty percent off so to us if you

297
00:17:08,058 --> 00:17:13,788
want to be in our store I don't look at

298
00:17:10,308 --> 00:17:15,109
herbarium as just a retail store I look

299
00:17:13,788 --> 00:17:18,618
at it as a place where people come to

300
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:22,128
get educated and become culturally aware

301
00:17:18,618 --> 00:17:25,128
of cannabis around them and you know

302
00:17:22,128 --> 00:17:28,638
there's a spotlight on our store all

303
00:17:25,128 --> 00:17:30,949
dispensaries you know come up to they

304
00:17:28,638 --> 00:17:33,378
they look up to us we have employees

305
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:35,450
come from other dispensaries trying to

306
00:17:33,378 --> 00:17:39,168
work here we have other bud tenders from

307
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:41,509
Hollywood hi great shopping here so we

308
00:17:39,169 --> 00:17:46,038
have a standard and people come here for

309
00:17:41,509 --> 00:17:48,319
a reason so to us we're looking when

310
00:17:46,038 --> 00:17:52,220
when we have a brand come in we're

311
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:55,249
looking for the ability to offer our

312
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:58,129
customers a better deal you know we're

313
00:17:55,249 --> 00:17:59,389
not looking for us to bend it to benefit

314
00:17:58,128 --> 00:18:06,648
more than we are looking for our

315
00:17:59,388 --> 00:18:10,908
customer so first of all you're also a

316
00:18:06,648 --> 00:18:14,538
distributor so what do you distribute we

317
00:18:10,909 --> 00:18:17,200
are close so how many Thompson they're

318
00:18:14,538 --> 00:18:20,019
in over 120 stores right now across

319
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:23,409
California across California

320
00:18:20,019 --> 00:18:25,700
so you distribute out of you hmm

321
00:18:23,409 --> 00:18:26,210
how long have you been doing that for a

322
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:28,129
year

323
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:29,929
I mean so we've had a growing part of

324
00:18:28,128 --> 00:18:32,418
your business yes we're actually looking

325
00:18:29,929 --> 00:18:33,980
to expand it so we've been focusing on

326
00:18:32,419 --> 00:18:35,900
do you think it's essential for a

327
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:39,799
retailer to survive

328
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:41,690
different avenues of development and

329
00:18:39,799 --> 00:18:43,609
reading you absolutely you need to find

330
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:46,070
out what your key performance indicators

331
00:18:43,609 --> 00:18:49,299
are and you need to strike them when

332
00:18:46,069 --> 00:18:55,419
they're when it's hot could you know

333
00:18:49,299 --> 00:18:58,159
absolutely at the end of the day if you

334
00:18:55,420 --> 00:19:00,920
believe if you sell something that you

335
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:03,680
believe in and people believe with you

336
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:06,529
you can make it as I was saying you know

337
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:11,630
there's other stores that sell select

338
00:19:06,529 --> 00:19:15,079
you know or connected but why would they

339
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:17,750
come here I don't pitch this stores a

340
00:19:15,079 --> 00:19:21,199
place that distributes you know I don't

341
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:25,819
this is a retail store and face value

342
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:30,259
it's a retail store but to us and our

343
00:19:25,819 --> 00:19:33,079
customer it's not noticed that you know

344
00:19:30,259 --> 00:19:35,750
first of all it's the brand consistency

345
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:37,669
is tough in this industry there's anchor

346
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:39,170
brands that everyone happens right in

347
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:40,820
their shops there's a few of them maybe

348
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:42,950
doesn't happen you know maybe it does

349
00:19:40,819 --> 00:19:45,259
maybe it doesn't have to go beyond that

350
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:49,130
they might have their own flower right

351
00:19:45,259 --> 00:19:51,910
and their own strains you know so it's

352
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:54,890
sort of like silos and this is

353
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:58,220
fascinating to me because I'm constantly

354
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:59,600
interested and you know unlike everyone

355
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:05,690
else and what I find what I'm looking

356
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:10,240
for someone doesn't I will constantly

357
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:10,240
I'm the type of person I say

358
00:20:23,109 --> 00:20:29,019
I love actually you so I'm always

359
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:33,160
interested in kind of counting it it's

360
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:34,779
not why not it's hard to get my lash it

361
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:38,740
might be but it sells

362
00:20:34,779 --> 00:20:44,859
90% of the time Keith he fails to fail

363
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:46,329
its testicles testing I don't think so I

364
00:20:44,859 --> 00:20:50,889
think they're just put profit margins

365
00:20:46,329 --> 00:20:53,919
out there it's it's it's not that of a

366
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:55,990
requested product that we have I have I

367
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:59,470
have people that come in and ask for it

368
00:20:55,990 --> 00:21:13,319
but it's not you know everyone has their

369
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:16,179
own thing I try to carry everything no I

370
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:20,829
mean it sucks I think there should be a

371
00:21:16,179 --> 00:21:22,780
lot more research done you know if vapes

372
00:21:20,829 --> 00:21:27,759
actually are dangerous they shouldn't be

373
00:21:22,779 --> 00:21:32,980
in the market well yeah there's so much

374
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:34,779
to it that we don't know yeah I don't

375
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:37,150
know I don't know enough to speak about

376
00:21:34,779 --> 00:21:39,129
it I just know that like vitamin E is

377
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:50,679
being is people are adding vitamin E in

378
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:53,919
it which is bad for your long I have not

379
00:21:50,679 --> 00:21:55,960
had to deal with anything yet I know

380
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:59,169
that our bud tenders have oh but they

381
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:00,429
are very educated you know we won as

382
00:21:59,169 --> 00:22:02,140
soon as it happened I know that there

383
00:22:00,429 --> 00:22:04,090
was a letter that we gave to all of our

384
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:06,460
bartenders to know the products we sell

385
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:12,369
and what's in them damage control oh

386
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:16,240
yeah yeah so yeah I mean we Jackie a

387
00:22:12,369 --> 00:22:17,929
know more come one second so this is

388
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:20,390
Jackie no Maura

389
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:22,759
with their there are man they're

390
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:25,730
actually one of my our longest jackie

391
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:29,890
has actually been here before I was

392
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:32,599
so she's also an OG a terrarium yeah

393
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:36,620
when she came in for an interview

394
00:22:32,599 --> 00:22:39,889
III knew she came with the building and

395
00:22:36,619 --> 00:23:07,039
I mean they can tell you a lot about the

396
00:22:39,890 --> 00:23:16,940
vape issue that's going on this is boo

397
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:21,409
he's our CFO he's our mascot so are you

398
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:22,850
saying a smaller dosage smaller medical

399
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:24,890
setting boy right there

400
00:23:22,849 --> 00:23:28,879
now we'll throw stuff in ten milligrams

401
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:32,060
right right right yeah but what about

402
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:34,250
your old time patients who had a high

403
00:23:32,059 --> 00:23:37,279
tolerance who needed those thousand

404
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:39,190
milligram bars because that's what they

405
00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:41,119
need it are they still around

406
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:44,529
well there's a loophole in the system

407
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:47,149
now teachers and go 2,000 milligrams

408
00:23:44,529 --> 00:23:49,940
there's a lot of like companies creating

409
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:50,470
like sprays grating like liquids that

410
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:53,919
can get

411
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:56,350
why I am one of those patients who had

412
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:58,990
like five milligrams and I find myself

413
00:23:56,349 --> 00:24:02,589
being satisfied with the 400 milligrams

414
00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:04,179
so it depends on like edible of course

415
00:24:02,589 --> 00:24:06,699
why you gotta do a little differently

416
00:24:04,179 --> 00:24:08,890
Ryan but 400 milligrams usually gives me

417
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:11,769
a satisfying high so so you kind of

418
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:14,890
you've shifted your method of intake yes

419
00:24:11,769 --> 00:24:16,929
yeah I definitely used as much like less

420
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:19,240
than I did in the past and you know is

421
00:24:16,929 --> 00:24:20,860
also dabbing rice and trades and right

422
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:23,909
those are for the heavier people sure

423
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:27,279
sure man you just do one little tiny dab

424
00:24:23,909 --> 00:24:28,630
yeah yeah well you guys carry like resin

425
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:31,240
and all that stuff and all the new stuff

426
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:32,770
- are you into that are you gonna

427
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:37,269
produce that stuff as well are you

428
00:24:32,769 --> 00:24:39,788
producing concentrate no yeah yeah but

429
00:24:37,269 --> 00:24:41,918
are you gonna add to your to this line

430
00:24:39,788 --> 00:24:43,509
of products absolutely yeah we're gonna

431
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:46,030
build the full kitchen in here

432
00:24:43,509 --> 00:24:50,369
I mean gummy bears and cookies and so

433
00:24:46,029 --> 00:24:50,369
you're gonna have more SKUs oh yeah
