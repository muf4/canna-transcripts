AB

37
00:01:43,718 --> 00:01:49,679
266 now how I kind of got into this um

38
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:51,879
when I was running for the assembly I

39
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,479
came in in

40
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:58,280
2012

41
00:01:53,478 --> 00:02:00,679
and my my father-in-law had cancer and

42
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:03,039
in 2011 is

43
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:06,240
um he needed you know to use some

44
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:08,759
cannabis to to so he be able to eat I

45
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:10,919
saw the ravages of that cancer what it

46
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:12,878
did to him how he couldn't eat and this

47
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:14,759
is a man that's from New Orleans and in

48
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:18,560
New Orleans they eat and they they fried

49
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:21,039
butter to eat I mean they love food he

50
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,199
had he had cancer to the throat so he

51
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:26,519
couldn't swallow it was just just

52
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:29,199
horrible um and eventually found

53
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:31,400
something at the medical marijuana place

54
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:33,399
that that helped with it and then one

55
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:35,120
day while I was campaigning no one could

56
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,640
take him around to the medical marijuana

57
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,280
place and they all looked at me and I

58
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:41,679
said look I'm running for

59
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,158
office I can't go over to that little

60
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,879
store that little place over there in

61
00:02:43,158 --> 00:02:47,399
the corner with the little sign that

62
00:02:45,878 --> 00:02:48,518
nobody knows what it is but everybody

63
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:52,158
knows what it

64
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:54,000
is and I remember taking him going in

65
00:02:52,158 --> 00:02:55,799
and he said do you have any cash on you

66
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,959
I said this sounds like a drug operation

67
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:02,319
like you wouldn't believe oh my God but

68
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:03,759
when I went in I didn't see a lot of

69
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:05,919
students or a lot of people who were

70
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:08,280
faking it I saw a lot of sick people I

71
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:11,479
saw a lot of people who needed it and

72
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:14,519
and I saw how professional each of these

73
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:17,119
places were and and it just changed my

74
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:21,280
outlook on it and ways that I never

75
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,280
would have seen before if I had not gone

76
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:30,399
in so what started me is is my

77
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:33,959
father-in-law who who has since passed

78
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:36,120
on when I got to the assembly um someone

79
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:38,199
said that you know none of those places

80
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:40,239
are regulated I said yes it has and said

81
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:44,000
how long has it been they said like

82
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:47,039
1995 I said this is 2012 and what's the

83
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,560
problem and I work with Mr Amano um and

84
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:52,560
Senator kareah L kah to try to figure

85
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,598
out a way to make get the regulations

86
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:58,360
through I saw them suffer burn and and

87
00:03:55,598 --> 00:04:01,759
die and not be able to get it done and

88
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:04,200
so I and then I saw measure D in La I'm

89
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:07,840
from Los Angeles South La 59th Assembly

90
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:11,759
District represents South La and I just

91
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:14,039
felt that for an industry a burgon

92
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:17,439
industry this big this large it should

93
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:19,079
have regulations and that um we the

94
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:20,238
legislator should take on that

95
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:24,400
responsibility espci you're talking

96
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:28,959
about Statewide and so um I decided to

97
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:31,359
put a bill through um I am blessed to

98
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:36,680
say that immediately after and soon

99
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:39,319
after um Mr B Mr kolie Mr wood all

100
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:43,759
started putting bills through that would

101
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:46,120
make legislation even better um the

102
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:48,080
other reason why I felt that we really

103
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:50,120
needed to do this that we're all

104
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:52,918
freshman well we're south for now and is

105
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:54,918
now freshman um there's been a lot of

106
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:55,918
infighting up and down when you talk

107
00:04:54,918 --> 00:04:58,478
about the

108
00:04:55,918 --> 00:05:02,279
legislature one of the things early on

109
00:04:58,478 --> 00:05:04,839
that Mr Bon and my Mr Woods Mr coolie

110
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:07,559
said even though one person may have put

111
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:09,879
their bill across first if we all join

112
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:12,280
together we'll get our bill across

113
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:14,120
period and for the first time we wanted

114
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:16,399
to show the rest of the assembly I'm be

115
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:19,360
quite frankly Frank with you that if you

116
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:21,799
work together on a on major legislation

117
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,879
and you you don't understand this

118
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,639
legislation went through is Major and

119
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:28,000
and I'm not saying because I'm one of

120
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:30,478
the authors but I think it is the number

121
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,240
one piece of legislation that's gone

122
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:35,599
through in its entirety no disrespect to

123
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:38,400
the bill that the state sener has been

124
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,400
through but in its

125
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:45,279
entirety and hopefully when you look at

126
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:47,079
us because one of the goals that I

127
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:49,679
wanted to have accomplished when he when

128
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:52,359
we did this is what happens when you

129
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,759
collaborate how big bills can get done

130
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:56,800
how big Ideas can be done when the

131
00:05:54,759 --> 00:06:00,110
legislature works together and that's

132
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:04,680
why I got involved in this

133
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:07,240
[Applause]

134
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:10,759
well greetings I'm actually going to say

135
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:12,639
some very similar things to Reggie um

136
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:16,240
I'm a member Ken kouy I'm from the

137
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:19,038
Sacramento County area and um all of the

138
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,160
authors involved in this issue I I think

139
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:22,959
it's important to flag our comparatively

140
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:25,400
new members of the

141
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:27,959
legislature uh number of members of of

142
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:31,679
Reggie in my class and then freshman

143
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:35,399
members uh Mr Mr Lackey Mr wood Mr

144
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:38,160
Maguire all newly elected just last fall

145
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:40,198
so I would say a key piece of this issue

146
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,360
was actually you suddenly had a group of

147
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:43,759
authors who have a little more time that

148
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,680
we can spend in the

149
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:47,199
legislature and are looking at this

150
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,560
phenomenon which I refer to as sort of

151
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,280
Groundhog Day

152
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,959
legislation where Year bye we we as a

153
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:55,439
state try to tackle Monumental issues

154
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:58,279
not not just medical marijuana

155
00:06:55,439 --> 00:07:00,000
Monumental issues and you work hard all

156
00:06:58,279 --> 00:07:01,679
year they become a black hole effort and

157
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,918
then the closing weeks the wheels come

158
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,918
off so that the next year you've got to

159
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:08,079
start all

160
00:07:04,918 --> 00:07:09,560
over and uh while I am a freshman I

161
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:11,279
actually started in the state capital as

162
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:13,680
a young guy back in

163
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:15,399
1977 eight years Chief to a part of

164
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,000
leadership I've run policy committees in

165
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:20,318
both houses my law practice was such I

166
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,800
always did legislation so I'm sort of in

167
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,800
an odd place that I've actually done

168
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:28,280
legislative work continuously for 38

169
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:30,199
years in my career but as a legislator

170
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:32,239
I'm in my third year

171
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:33,879
so I'm a founder of the city of Ranch

172
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,918
Cordova in Sacramento County was mayor

173
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:38,039
there twice served 10 years in city

174
00:07:35,918 --> 00:07:39,918
council although there's about 500

175
00:07:38,038 --> 00:07:41,560
cities in California within a very short

176
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:43,839
time after my election to the city

177
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:46,560
council I started getting involved with

178
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:49,839
the league of cities and and between 06

179
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,800
and 09 or really 04 and 09 moved to the

180
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:54,478
number two position in the league of

181
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:57,598
cities I was about 5 months away from

182
00:07:54,478 --> 00:07:59,639
becoming president of the league but in

183
00:07:57,598 --> 00:08:02,158
2009 the Senate asked me to come in and

184
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:04,879
in a policy role and run a big policy

185
00:08:02,158 --> 00:08:07,399
committee for them which I did promptly

186
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:10,479
resigning from my post with the league

187
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:12,638
uh so I would say I have a pretty strong

188
00:08:10,478 --> 00:08:13,800
governmental skill set I think I'm

189
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,598
pretty

190
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:18,360
collaborative and when the league

191
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:20,399
approached me on this bill I had an

192
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:22,560
interest in it because uh Luke Kare I've

193
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:24,519
known him very well for a lot of years I

194
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,720
was very close to L understood his

195
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:27,799
effort in the prior session with Senate

196
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,319
Bill

197
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:32,000
1262 but I also have this conviction

198
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,759
that if my colleagues and I can be a

199
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,158
part of a a group of legislators

200
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:39,000
starting to become dominant in state

201
00:08:36,158 --> 00:08:41,838
capital where some of these big issues

202
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,320
we actually start and finish in a

203
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:46,920
year and we start expanding that from

204
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,519
this beach head to other key issues that

205
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:49,919
at the end of our career actually people

206
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:53,039
will look at our time the legislature

207
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:54,879
and say the state of California and the

208
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:58,159
legislature in the assembly entered a

209
00:08:54,879 --> 00:09:00,679
new era so that was actually a big part

210
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:01,919
of my interest I actually sat down at

211
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:04,359
the league of cities and says I actually

212
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:06,000
think I'll be a strong author but you

213
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,720
have to know that I can tell you that

214
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,839
there will come times in the

215
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:11,639
conversation where although I'm a strong

216
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,839
author on your behalf I'm going to do

217
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:15,838
things that you may not agree with

218
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:19,279
because ultimately I think the stake

219
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:22,200
here is not this issue but it's

220
00:09:19,278 --> 00:09:24,120
institutional if we can be successful in

221
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:26,640
taking some big issues and bringing them

222
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:28,919
to a close and create some institutional

223
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:31,399
momentum we will touch the state in a

224
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:35,599
variety of ways which matter when you

225
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:36,958
have 12 years to serve uh I feel in a

226
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:40,040
particular way I kind of helped that

227
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:41,879
along I did start out with a bill AB 266

228
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:43,838
in the assembly policy process when it

229
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:47,078
went through the B&amp;P committee on the

230
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:48,560
day it was heard uh I know Rob's bill

231
00:09:47,078 --> 00:09:51,719
got eight or nine votes that day in that

232
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:53,159
committee my vote got my bill got 13

233
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,879
same committee same

234
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:59,439
day but as soon as we got into probes we

235
00:09:55,879 --> 00:10:02,200
merged the bills AB 266 which you hear

236
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,800
lot about actually for about half of the

237
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:07,278
year was the coolie

238
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:09,879
bill but I actually felt that

239
00:10:07,278 --> 00:10:12,838
uh good work had been done trying to put

240
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:15,639
the ideas together I felt that we had a

241
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:18,000
pretty good working product in that

242
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:19,439
committee and I'm enough of a political

243
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,958
person to understand that actually if

244
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,120
you're Rob Bon from Alam

245
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:25,799
County this subject is more of a

246
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:28,120
district issue for Rob bana than it is

247
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:30,199
for me in Sacramento County so I

248
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:31,959
actually suggested that we should should

249
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:33,399
take the merged bills I would become the

250
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:35,439
lead on his bill we'd put the new

251
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:38,039
content in his old bill which stayed

252
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:40,519
with the committee and he would we'd put

253
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:42,879
the new content in 266 and we'd make him

254
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:45,278
the lead author and that was this

255
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:46,600
collaboration strategy it it could sound

256
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:48,078
funny that you menend the same stuff

257
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:50,399
into two bills one of which you leave

258
00:10:48,078 --> 00:10:53,120
behind but the purpose of

259
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:55,720
that in Appropriations was to send the

260
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:58,919
signal that you could not put a a sheet

261
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:01,879
of paper between where Ken kulie was on

262
00:10:58,919 --> 00:11:03,679
this and where Rob bonto was and that

263
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:05,240
became sort of our way to signal that we

264
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:07,278
are serious and Earnest about trying to

265
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:09,799
move something forward and then it did

266
00:11:07,278 --> 00:11:11,958
become as as Reggie explained a great

267
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:14,958
collaboration of members Republican

268
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:16,759
Democrat staff and a lot of Staff

269
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:18,799
particularly on the Republican side in

270
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:21,039
their long careers had never been

271
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:23,159
brought into the table in a conversation

272
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:24,480
as we brought them in so I'm very

273
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:27,639
excited to be here I think it is a

274
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:31,720
milestone accomplishment uh long time in

275
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:32,720
coming and uh just an honor to be here

276
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:35,440
can

277
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:38,360
I I just want to quickly

278
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:40,639
say in the interest of

279
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:42,839
collaboration there were three bills one

280
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:42,839
was

281
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:49,319
mine but we didn't lose our minds about

282
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:52,000
it and we put our EOS to the side and at

283
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,000
the door

284
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:01,159
y well my name's Jim Wood I represent

285
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:02,799
represent the second Assembly District

286
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:05,039
which is the North Coast of California

287
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:10,199
so it's the northern half of Sona County

288
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:10,199
mesino humble Trinity and delnort

289
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:17,000
[Applause]

290
00:12:14,078 --> 00:12:20,159
counties so we have a little we have a

291
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,159
little herb business in our

292
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:25,920
County and my interest my interest in

293
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:28,240
this um came from my time in campaigning

294
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:29,919
you know by training I'm a dentist uh

295
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,120
practice Dentistry for 27 years so I

296
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:33,479
have a healthcare background um over

297
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:35,839
those years I encountered a lot of

298
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,639
people who use medical cannabis and and

299
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:40,079
began to appreciate the value of that

300
00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:43,480
especially uh my my receptionist her

301
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:46,239
husband was a patient uh and um we got

302
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:48,120
she worked for me for 25 years and which

303
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,680
is a pretty phenomenal in this day and

304
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,120
age to have anybody work for anybody for

305
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:53,519
that long but we developed a

306
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,078
relationship around that and my I began

307
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,480
to get an understanding for for the

308
00:12:55,078 --> 00:12:58,759
industry and and for the value of

309
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,800
medical cannabis when I was campaigning

310
00:12:58,759 --> 00:13:02,838
the things that uh con began to concern

311
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:05,359
me were some of the environmental things

312
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:07,680
that were happening there are folks that

313
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,360
are absolutely trying to do the right

314
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:11,319
thing and there are folks that are

315
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,399
absolutely raping and destroying our

316
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:14,600
environment and the the Legacy in the

317
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:16,839
history of the North Coast has been

318
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:18,920
about Environmental Conservation about

319
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:20,839
Environmental Protection we protect our

320
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:22,799
Coastline we protect our redwoods we

321
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:25,079
protect our salmon bearing streams and

322
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:28,559
to see what I saw firsthand that was

323
00:13:25,078 --> 00:13:30,879
going on um in in my district broke my

324
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:34,078
heart quite frankly and when I went to

325
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:36,639
Sacramento in December um and sat down

326
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:40,239
with my new staff who knew nothing about

327
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:41,480
cannabis and I knew this much um I said

328
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,560
we are going to work on a bill that's

329
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,039
going to be very focused on the

330
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:47,278
environmental challenges we're facing on

331
00:13:44,039 --> 00:13:50,399
the North Coast and um so we set as set

332
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:52,879
set in motion to do that um in the

333
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:55,480
process I got the opportunity to meet

334
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:57,240
these two fine gentlemen here Mr Lackey

335
00:13:55,480 --> 00:14:00,159
who's also a freshman legislator like

336
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:02,680
myself and Mr bont and it became really

337
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:04,399
apparent for us to be successful we

338
00:14:02,679 --> 00:14:07,599
needed to collaborate and so we

339
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:10,159
continued to collaborate um my challenge

340
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:12,519
um quite frankly was that people don't

341
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:15,519
think about the environmental impacts of

342
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:17,399
of largescale industrial cultivation and

343
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:19,839
and for me I was really stubborn and

344
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:21,679
Reggie and Ken know that really well now

345
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:23,839
um is is that I kept my bill very

346
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:25,958
separate for that very reason because I

347
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:27,000
really wanted to highlight that among my

348
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:28,679
colleagues and you know what was

349
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,958
interesting about this whole process as

350
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:34,239
we went through it was that we um we

351
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:37,359
took when you you mentioned marijuana or

352
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,320
cannabis to people who in the legisl

353
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,440
they kind of looked at you they of

354
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:43,079
Snicker you know and they kind of look

355
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:45,880
away but we have taken that to a point

356
00:14:43,078 --> 00:14:48,039
where we freely talk about this in a

357
00:14:45,879 --> 00:14:50,240
very very open way and that is a huge

358
00:14:48,039 --> 00:14:50,240
step

359
00:14:54,278 --> 00:15:00,958
forward so I mean to to the point where

360
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:02,679
you know we have had a party we had an

361
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:04,758
end of end of session party in my office

362
00:15:02,679 --> 00:15:07,039
and we actually we made mock marijuana

363
00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:10,399
brownies you know um

364
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:13,719
and mock mock

365
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:15,679
mock but we did have doubters you

366
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:17,278
know especially the speaker of the

367
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:18,799
assembly when I took hers to her office

368
00:15:17,278 --> 00:15:21,799
she's I'm not sure if she ever ateed or

369
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:24,198
not but but um but but you know the

370
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:26,639
value the value of the collaboration you

371
00:15:24,198 --> 00:15:28,359
know I maybe I was just you know new

372
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,680
enough I had I really had no legislative

373
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,800
background I com from from a local city

374
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:33,638
council okay practice Dentistry small

375
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:35,359
town 12,000 people that's where I live

376
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:37,399
small small town Northern California

377
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,440
town I had no knowledge of this and come

378
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:41,839
in except someone like like Mr Coy who

379
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,600
has tremendous knowledge of of of the

380
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:45,199
legislature and Mr Jon Ser who comes

381
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,839
from an area and has a background that

382
00:15:45,198 --> 00:15:50,359
is that is um very different from my so

383
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:52,279
you put the five of us together as as

384
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:54,519
authors on these and we actually

385
00:15:52,278 --> 00:15:56,159
Encompass the state of California and

386
00:15:54,519 --> 00:15:58,519
that's the value of the collaboration

387
00:15:56,159 --> 00:16:00,799
here and so so what has done for us and

388
00:15:58,519 --> 00:16:03,560
me is that you know these are my go-to

389
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:05,879
guys on on not just this issue but a ton

390
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:07,518
of issues and so to be able to build

391
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:09,318
these relationships and friendships with

392
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,639
people moving forward and I will tell

393
00:16:09,318 --> 00:16:12,679
you as I want I know there's a lot of

394
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:15,399
questions but I want to tell you this is

395
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:18,958
the beginning this is not the end of the

396
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:18,958
process okay keep that in

397
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:25,719
mind so nothing is ever perfect um and

398
00:16:24,278 --> 00:16:27,360
you need to know that upfront we know

399
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:29,079
it's not perfect and we know why it's

400
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,399
not perfect and we want to make it get

401
00:16:29,078 --> 00:16:33,078
perfect um but but this is the beginning

402
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:35,639
of the process and it's it has been

403
00:16:33,078 --> 00:16:37,159
needed for a very very long time so so

404
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:38,959
I'm just excited to have been uh young

405
00:16:37,159 --> 00:16:41,879
and dumb and you know enough to get

406
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:43,958
involved in this and and tackle a really

407
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:45,639
difficult issue that was in inherently

408
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:48,198
really really important to my district

409
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:49,600
so um so at the end of the day um if the

410
00:16:48,198 --> 00:16:51,278
governor signs these bills I think we

411
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,120
all have a lot to a lot to be thankful

412
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:56,198
for and a lot to be proud

413
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:58,000
of all right the uh next the next

414
00:16:56,198 --> 00:16:59,519
question is a two-part question there's

415
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,639
been a lot of talk OB see people have

416
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:04,160
had concerns about the bills can felons

417
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:06,078
get a license who can is there you know

418
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,759
what is the May versus shall mean type

419
00:17:06,078 --> 00:17:11,038
of a situation so the the the question

420
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:14,078
is um what is the most important

421
00:17:11,038 --> 00:17:16,439
elements of this legislation to you and

422
00:17:14,078 --> 00:17:19,599
what parts do you think need

423
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:22,079
need to be fixed and you don't have to

424
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:27,318
give all of them just a

425
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:31,759
couple well well for me um I do a lot of

426
00:17:27,318 --> 00:17:34,240
work um on recidivism um I'm the chair

427
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:36,200
of budget sub five over the prisons

428
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,720
incarceration and I know the war and

429
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:40,080
drugs especially the war in marijuana

430
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:43,200
has resulted in a lot of black and brown

431
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:47,079
Brothers ending up in jail um really for

432
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:50,120
lowlevel offenses um being able to work

433
00:17:47,079 --> 00:17:51,720
on this um to kind of almost start the

434
00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:52,879
discussion of trying to decriminalize

435
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:55,558
that so we're going have people come

436
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,760
back into society and H and work and get

437
00:17:55,558 --> 00:17:59,399
back to their families is really

438
00:17:56,759 --> 00:18:01,640
important to me um

439
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:04,200
even when the discussion about having

440
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:06,520
people who formerly had records or may

441
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:10,000
have been charged with something out of

442
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:12,119
state but never really was incarcerated

443
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,159
um to have them worked in this field

444
00:18:12,119 --> 00:18:16,279
because when we bring people back we

445
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:17,919
want them to have working jobs that they

446
00:18:16,279 --> 00:18:20,399
may actually be comfortable in working

447
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:21,840
in I don't mean that to be factious but

448
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:27,080
they may be good at it and they can work

449
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:30,199
in it um and we have to find a way I

450
00:18:27,079 --> 00:18:33,199
know um because Mr coie worked on it a

451
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:36,440
lot a whole lot and because I know law

452
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:38,558
enforcement um is adamant about allowing

453
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:42,480
former felons and individuals to work in

454
00:18:38,558 --> 00:18:45,678
this build in this business uh not not

455
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:48,079
to allow them at all um I I think

456
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:50,038
there's a happy medium where we can meet

457
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:52,158
um for me that might be the next steps

458
00:18:50,038 --> 00:18:56,038
that we work through but it also becomes

459
00:18:52,159 --> 00:18:58,480
part of us desensitizing as Mr wood said

460
00:18:56,038 --> 00:19:00,720
you more you talk about it before before

461
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,319
you would say you talk about cannabis

462
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,519
and then they called us the Cannabis

463
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:06,960
Kings and making jokes like that to go

464
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:09,038
from that to you guys have some a

465
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:12,440
serious piece of legislation and and

466
00:19:09,038 --> 00:19:15,038
start talking about ab66 266 and and

467
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:18,080
talking about in a serious way and so

468
00:19:15,038 --> 00:19:22,720
for me right now um the the the number

469
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:25,558
one issue is to how to integrate people

470
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:28,000
who have been charged with this may have

471
00:19:25,558 --> 00:19:29,960
serve a little time how to get them

472
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,359
involved in this business because

473
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:36,440
because quite frankly this is a

474
00:19:32,359 --> 00:19:38,240
multi-billion doll business and we need

475
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:40,519
to ensure that everybody has an

476
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,880
opportunity to work in it especially

477
00:19:40,519 --> 00:19:44,279
since we're talking about it may have

478
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:45,799
been a time where it was illegal like in

479
00:19:44,279 --> 00:19:47,960
prohibition if you look at the

480
00:19:45,798 --> 00:19:51,679
prohibition laws and

481
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:54,880
now hopefully in the future if it

482
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:57,200
becomes um legal that we can re

483
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:59,990
acclimate those people back in into this

484
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:04,880
business

485
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:07,319
[Applause]

486
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,799
well it's interesting question I think I

487
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:11,558
tend to

488
00:20:08,798 --> 00:20:14,279
feel in the the broad brush areas where

489
00:20:11,558 --> 00:20:16,639
IT addresses both public health or

490
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:18,359
public health Public Safety local

491
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,759
control those are very important

492
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:24,079
elements I think the use of existing

493
00:20:20,759 --> 00:20:26,720
state agency expertise in food and EG

494
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:29,119
and in public health uh the testing

495
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,839
standards that will be introduced I

496
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:33,239
think all those are very important

497
00:20:30,839 --> 00:20:35,720
Provisions uh an interesting part I

498
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:37,960
think when you look at it from sort of a

499
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:40,159
from a larger conversation standpoint

500
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:42,120
I'm not particularly a proponent of

501
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:43,919
legalization but I understand that there

502
00:20:42,119 --> 00:20:47,038
will be a legalization

503
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:48,520
conversation and I from day one I've

504
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:51,038
sort of actually had the view that if

505
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:52,960
you if you're interested in

506
00:20:51,038 --> 00:20:54,759
legalization you would probably be

507
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:57,319
advantaged by having the legislature

508
00:20:54,759 --> 00:21:00,879
establish a a systematic framework for

509
00:20:57,319 --> 00:21:04,158
the regulation of medical

510
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:06,559
cannabis uh with league with the league

511
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:09,240
of cities in support because I think

512
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:11,918
what you can anticipate is as you go

513
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:13,278
into January and February of next year

514
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:16,400
there will be cities up and down

515
00:21:13,278 --> 00:21:18,679
California almost 500 talking about the

516
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,720
Breakthrough that this legislation

517
00:21:18,679 --> 00:21:23,200
represents and consequently if you are

518
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:26,519
on the ballot in November of next year

519
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:28,640
on a related topic it will appear that

520
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:30,558
the jump between the new status quo and

521
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:33,120
California and that question is a

522
00:21:30,558 --> 00:21:35,798
smaller jump so I just think I would

523
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:37,239
just kind of throw out that well I

524
00:21:35,798 --> 00:21:40,400
actually am not a proponent of

525
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:43,480
legalization I'm not that just stated

526
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:45,919
the truth the political side of me the

527
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:48,759
tactician in me just says actually this

528
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:50,880
is a major stepping stone to the next

529
00:21:48,759 --> 00:21:53,640
conversation and for a lot of folks

530
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:56,200
there uh the question that is coming

531
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:59,320
will seem a smaller question and I will

532
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:01,880
point out that um in I

533
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:04,240
and I think it is the Senate Bill there

534
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:06,840
are some general language that deals

535
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,278
with a study to be commissioned related

536
00:22:06,839 --> 00:22:10,720
to motor

537
00:22:08,278 --> 00:22:12,880
skills and I would actually say this

538
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,640
this study will address help address the

539
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:17,720
question of impaired

540
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:20,120
driving and I would just suggest that in

541
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:22,880
the in 2010 during the campaign on

542
00:22:20,119 --> 00:22:24,000
proposition 19 a very big question a lot

543
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:27,360
of people's minds was actually that

544
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,278
impaired driving issue so even this

545
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:31,678
little study which was

546
00:22:29,278 --> 00:22:34,519
uh proposed by Mr Lackey our colleague

547
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:37,480
who's not here I think even that study

548
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:41,558
will play a an outsized role in the year

549
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:44,240
ahead so I want to point that out to you

550
00:22:41,558 --> 00:22:45,839
thanks well my my my bill's a little

551
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,038
different and and it's talks about we

552
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:49,278
talk about some of the environmental

553
00:22:47,038 --> 00:22:51,359
issues that that come up with that with

554
00:22:49,278 --> 00:22:54,038
with the cultivation so uh with with

555
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:55,319
cannabis um so kind of some of the

556
00:22:54,038 --> 00:22:57,119
highlights of my bill first of all

557
00:22:55,319 --> 00:22:58,678
funding for the new cannabis Bureau

558
00:22:57,119 --> 00:23:01,239
comes from a funding mechanism in my

559
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:03,080
bill $10 million to start this up and

560
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:05,480
there will be I believe money that will

561
00:23:03,079 --> 00:23:07,558
go um give us the opportunity directly

562
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:09,960
to to impact some of the cleanup efforts

563
00:23:07,558 --> 00:23:12,000
that we need to do in my district so in

564
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:13,880
addition The Authority for all the

565
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,319
licensing entities to assess fees to

566
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:18,919
cover licensing and administrative costs

567
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:20,119
unfortunately with lure comes cost and

568
00:23:18,919 --> 00:23:21,799
that is I know that's going to be

569
00:23:20,119 --> 00:23:24,079
frustrating to you but hey I worked in a

570
00:23:21,798 --> 00:23:26,158
very regulated industry I'm licensed I'm

571
00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:27,558
licensed in 14,000 different ways it

572
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:29,039
seems like and there's unfortunately a

573
00:23:27,558 --> 00:23:30,599
fee associated with that

574
00:23:29,038 --> 00:23:32,640
um and it sometimes gets redundant it

575
00:23:30,599 --> 00:23:35,678
gets frustrating but it is sort of the

576
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:37,159
cost of legitimacy and that's that's how

577
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:39,120
you're going to move forward here is to

578
00:23:37,159 --> 00:23:41,919
you want to be a part which I know you

579
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:43,959
all do of of the mainstream business

580
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:45,520
Community out there this is there is a

581
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:47,558
cost to that and some of some of what

582
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:50,158
you're going to experience is is what I

583
00:23:47,558 --> 00:23:52,319
consider the pathway to legitimacy has a

584
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:54,120
cost and I hope that I hope that you

585
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:56,119
understand that and accept that and it's

586
00:23:54,119 --> 00:23:58,038
our job to try to make it reasonable and

587
00:23:56,119 --> 00:23:59,479
and fair and that's I think as we go

588
00:23:58,038 --> 00:24:00,839
forward that's that's fundamentally

589
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:03,159
we're going to continue to follow all of

590
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:04,639
this and and and and work on it because

591
00:24:03,159 --> 00:24:06,278
the beginning is this is the beginning

592
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,440
the regulatory process as it plays out

593
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:09,720
over the next two or three years is

594
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:11,120
going to be absolutely critical so um

595
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:12,400
you you need to keep your you need to

596
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:14,399
keep your eye on the ball you need to

597
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:16,159
keep attention to that and you need to

598
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,759
keep us informed so we can so we can

599
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:20,960
help to Advocate um another thing comes

600
00:24:18,759 --> 00:24:22,679
from my my bill uh is the creation of of

601
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,798
a fines and penalties account and that

602
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:26,600
money would be used to assess on on

603
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:28,200
non-compliant actors that are growing in

604
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:29,038
my areas that are not following the

605
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,000
rules

606
00:24:29,038 --> 00:24:33,759
um to help pay for some environmental

607
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:36,720
cleanup to pay for some enforcement uh

608
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:38,879
for state and local law enforcement um

609
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,839
important to me and what I didn't expect

610
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,200
immediately when I introduced this bill

611
00:24:40,839 --> 00:24:44,359
was to

612
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:45,440
um you know I was all about the

613
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:46,798
environmental part of this but you

614
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,080
cannot talk about the environmental

615
00:24:46,798 --> 00:24:50,480
component unless you talk about

616
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:53,158
cultivation we knew that really early on

617
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:55,440
and we kind of kept that as a card um

618
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:56,679
and so what was important to me is that

619
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,840
as we went forward that we would

620
00:24:56,679 --> 00:25:00,360
actually have cannabis actually

621
00:24:58,839 --> 00:25:02,199
regulated under the California

622
00:25:00,359 --> 00:25:04,398
Department of food and agriculture as an

623
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:06,558
Agricultural Product really really

624
00:25:04,398 --> 00:25:07,639
critical from my perspective why if

625
00:25:06,558 --> 00:25:09,558
you're not if you're not in the

626
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:11,278
cultivation business out there um and

627
00:25:09,558 --> 00:25:13,798
certainly not an outdoor grower you may

628
00:25:11,278 --> 00:25:16,480
or may not do understand that but the

629
00:25:13,798 --> 00:25:18,639
The Growers who are growing um the

630
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:21,360
cultivators want to be a part of the

631
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:23,880
legitimate community and with that will

632
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:26,079
my intention My Hope Is that the access

633
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:27,840
to not only the regulatory scheme but

634
00:25:26,079 --> 00:25:29,319
the programs that are available through

635
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:31,359
the department food and agriculture will

636
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:33,158
be valuable to the industry going

637
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:35,639
forward

638
00:25:33,159 --> 00:25:37,000
um the the other thing for me is really

639
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:38,960
important for the requirement for

640
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,679
cannabis cultivators to follow all the

641
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,519
environmental laws one of the biggest

642
00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:44,960
things I hear from my world is that

643
00:25:42,519 --> 00:25:46,480
grape Growers get really irritated with

644
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,600
cannabis cultivators because grape

645
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,200
Growers or Farmers whether you're Dairy

646
00:25:48,599 --> 00:25:51,398
Farmer whatever you have a lot of rules

647
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:53,200
to follow and there's a feeling that

648
00:25:51,398 --> 00:25:54,879
cannabis cultivators follow none of them

649
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,399
and it's actually true for to for the

650
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,960
most part so so you have to be you have

651
00:25:57,398 --> 00:26:01,119
to be willing to come on board and

652
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,159
follow those same environmental laws the

653
00:26:01,119 --> 00:26:04,359
other thing which I think is really

654
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:06,159
important is going to play into 266

655
00:26:04,359 --> 00:26:07,479
really really well and we these are this

656
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:09,559
is a package now we ought to we ought to

657
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:11,519
just recognize that this is this is a

658
00:26:09,558 --> 00:26:13,839
package is is some sort of a unique

659
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:16,240
identifier program which is which is in

660
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:18,639
my bill we want to be able to track from

661
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:20,880
seed to sale U for a variety of

662
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,759
different reasons number one for me is

663
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,120
is going to be um Public Safety you know

664
00:26:22,759 --> 00:26:26,278
I mean for kry out loud people out there

665
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:27,678
grow broccoli and lettuce and tomatoes

666
00:26:26,278 --> 00:26:29,278
and things like that and if there's a

667
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:31,640
health problem something that gets into

668
00:26:29,278 --> 00:26:33,798
a crop we've got ways now to to to

669
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:35,399
Target that small part of that crop and

670
00:26:33,798 --> 00:26:37,798
take that off the market rather than

671
00:26:35,398 --> 00:26:40,000
wiping out the entire system for for a

672
00:26:37,798 --> 00:26:42,158
year so so those are some of kind of the

673
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,960
highlights of of what we're doing uh

674
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:46,320
with with my bill um and and but it once

675
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,558
again it's it's it's collaborating with

676
00:26:46,319 --> 00:26:49,480
those and I'm G I'm going to do this now

677
00:26:47,558 --> 00:26:51,440
because I I I want to forget I want to

678
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:53,558
give a shout out to folks that that work

from the crowd now

692
00:27:36,519 --> 00:27:41,158
members thank you really appreciate you

693
00:27:38,519 --> 00:27:43,278
guys here heading this project uh my

694
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:46,440
name is David Aro I'm elected council

695
00:27:43,278 --> 00:27:49,558
member and St Gabriel Valley and my

696
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:52,558
first uh encounter with the industry was

697
00:27:49,558 --> 00:27:56,599
back in 1989 when I attended home

698
00:27:52,558 --> 00:27:58,960
state so as a freshman I moved forward I

699
00:27:56,599 --> 00:28:00,918
served my country gradu

700
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:03,319
uh from Humble State and we helped push

701
00:28:00,919 --> 00:28:05,640
the initiative back in 1996 so after

702
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:07,798
almost 20 years it's glad to see that it

703
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:09,919
has some you guys moving forward in the

704
00:28:07,798 --> 00:28:12,278
right direction one one of my questions

705
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:14,519
was answered the first question was

706
00:28:12,278 --> 00:28:17,038
answered and the thing was um the

707
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:19,839
Trailblazers back in the90s when they

708
00:28:17,038 --> 00:28:21,599
were moving towards this Movement we had

709
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:23,599
we had people that got in trouble so I

710
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:25,439
appreciate that you guys are taking a

711
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:26,678
look at that because I think that those

712
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,919
individuals should deserve an

713
00:28:26,679 --> 00:28:31,679
opportunity in this industry but my

714
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:33,799
other my my second question was um what

715
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:35,640
are we doing in regards to the medical

716
00:28:33,798 --> 00:28:38,038
research part in the state being in in

717
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:41,559
conflicts with the federal government um

718
00:28:38,038 --> 00:28:43,879
we have um a lot of um soldiers coming

719
00:28:41,558 --> 00:28:46,839
back some of the statistics are with

720
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:50,880
PTSD they're dying at a rate of 22

721
00:28:46,839 --> 00:28:53,000
people per day um so to me that's

722
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:55,760
touches my heart very passionate about

723
00:28:53,000 --> 00:29:00,038
it and what is that the state

724
00:28:55,759 --> 00:29:00,038
legislators is going to do thank you

725
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:07,799
question sounds like a medical question

726
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,359
to me yeah thanks thanks Rich well Dr

727
00:29:07,798 --> 00:29:10,720
Jones s telling us about how you feel

728
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:13,119
about

729
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:15,319
that no I think it's absolutely critical

730
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:17,639
that we that we there there will be I

731
00:29:15,319 --> 00:29:20,480
believe that that the the movement

732
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:22,278
forward you know California for one for

733
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:24,399
once again actually needs to lead the

734
00:29:22,278 --> 00:29:26,759
way on this issue you know um we you

735
00:29:24,398 --> 00:29:28,918
know we LED we led the way in 1996 with

736
00:29:26,759 --> 00:29:30,519
with 215 and then we've kind of taken a

737
00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:32,360
backseat it's time for California to

738
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:34,480
lead the way again and so medical

739
00:29:32,359 --> 00:29:36,278
research I believe that there will be an

740
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,640
emphasis on medical research and and

741
00:29:36,278 --> 00:29:40,200
public health and and I think it's going

742
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:42,399
to happen it's not specific to the bills

743
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:44,399
but um but it doesn't mean we can't we

744
00:29:42,398 --> 00:29:45,798
can't move in that in that direction so

745
00:29:44,398 --> 00:29:47,359
I think as the and I think part of

746
00:29:45,798 --> 00:29:48,918
that's going to part of that should come

747
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:50,678
from the industry you know there should

748
00:29:48,919 --> 00:29:52,360
be a way to do that I mean I know that

749
00:29:50,679 --> 00:29:54,960
the testing now is becoming more and

750
00:29:52,359 --> 00:29:56,558
more sophisticated um on and and there

751
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,200
is research out there how do we put it

752
00:29:56,558 --> 00:30:00,798
all together and and how do we we

753
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:02,960
actually have reasonable uh symposiums

754
00:30:00,798 --> 00:30:04,839
on the medical the medical research and

755
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:07,200
and and and promote medical research so

756
00:30:04,839 --> 00:30:08,278
so it's something that um hasn't been

757
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,319
hasn't been brought up so I thank you

758
00:30:08,278 --> 00:30:11,119
for your question I thank you for your

759
00:30:09,319 --> 00:30:13,359
service on both as you know to our

760
00:30:11,119 --> 00:30:15,278
country and also to your city um because

761
00:30:13,359 --> 00:30:17,398
we need people like you uh with your

762
00:30:15,278 --> 00:30:18,519
background so so but but it is important

763
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:20,000
it's certainly my background is

764
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:21,200
something that I that I I want to I want

765
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,640
to look at and I I appreciate the

766
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:25,600
question and and we will we will look

767
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:28,880
into it let me jump out on that if I may

768
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:31,158
too uh you know a bill like this is not

769
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:33,080
just a structure of law but it's it's

770
00:30:31,159 --> 00:30:35,519
sort of a trigger to start releasing a

771
00:30:33,079 --> 00:30:37,199
lot of energy uh every time we testify

772
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:39,240
in the bill Reggie was out there noting

773
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,558
that the US Department of Justice has

774
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:42,120
said they're going to take a more

775
00:30:40,558 --> 00:30:43,960
relaxed attitude about marijuana

776
00:30:42,119 --> 00:30:46,119
enforcement generally when a state has a

777
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:48,679
robust law in place that was a key

778
00:30:46,119 --> 00:30:51,518
element of the strategy and so and the

779
00:30:48,679 --> 00:30:53,200
bills actually include sort of this

780
00:30:51,519 --> 00:30:55,558
Express authorizations if someone's

781
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:58,960
property licensed under this they they

782
00:30:55,558 --> 00:31:01,359
can't be prosecuted under California law

783
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:03,278
and uh on the issue of research there's

784
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:04,759
research here we're setting up the

785
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:07,000
Department of Public Health to develop

786
00:31:04,759 --> 00:31:08,759
Testing Laboratories so there's a lot of

787
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,119
very substantive work that's going to be

788
00:31:08,759 --> 00:31:13,519
unfolding in the food and a area in

789
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:17,038
public health kind of developing

790
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:18,798
standards measurements and in general a

791
00:31:17,038 --> 00:31:19,480
way to think about the whole impact of

792
00:31:18,798 --> 00:31:22,359
the

793
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:24,159
bill this will sound sort of funny but I

794
00:31:22,359 --> 00:31:27,319
I often invoke this even in some of our

795
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:29,159
conversations in the capital is every

796
00:31:27,319 --> 00:31:31,480
California County every every

797
00:31:29,159 --> 00:31:34,440
professional discipline may not be all

798
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:36,960
on board from day one but as you start

799
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:39,600
to make Beach heads where there's

800
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:41,240
Acceptance in counties and professions

801
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:42,678
within the structure of this bill as it

802
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:44,720
starts to release some energy in

803
00:31:42,679 --> 00:31:46,559
research and Enterprise and other sorts

804
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:47,919
of things other folks who've been

805
00:31:46,558 --> 00:31:49,839
negative or sitting on the sidelines

806
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:52,360
will start seeing it through a different

807
00:31:49,839 --> 00:31:53,599
lens and the analogy I use and I just

808
00:31:52,359 --> 00:31:55,839
would hearten you with this thought it's

809
00:31:53,599 --> 00:31:56,839
sort of a crazy analogy it sounds sort

810
00:31:55,839 --> 00:31:59,158
of

811
00:31:56,839 --> 00:32:02,879
militaristic but in World War II we

812
00:31:59,159 --> 00:32:05,360
fought the campaign in the Pacific and

813
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:07,200
the basic strategy was not every island

814
00:32:05,359 --> 00:32:10,119
where there's resistance is is something

815
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:12,480
we need to tackle we will be targeted we

816
00:32:10,119 --> 00:32:14,319
will advance we will make progress and

817
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:16,440
as we make that progress sort of moving

818
00:32:14,319 --> 00:32:18,918
northward through the Pacific places

819
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:21,600
that initially might have been resistant

820
00:32:18,919 --> 00:32:23,759
started to fall into line and that's a

821
00:32:21,599 --> 00:32:26,119
more Dynamic way to think about how this

822
00:32:23,759 --> 00:32:28,398
bill will affect the future of marijuana

823
00:32:26,119 --> 00:32:29,839
in California but I think a lot fronts

824
00:32:28,398 --> 00:32:31,199
that Dynamic model is probably what

825
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:33,000
you're going to see unfold and I

826
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:36,240
actually think it'll also be in the med

827
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:38,798
the research area so there you go and

828
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:41,038
and let me just quickly add because you

829
00:32:38,798 --> 00:32:42,759
these forums a lot of times you think

830
00:32:41,038 --> 00:32:46,278
you're coming and you're getting answers

831
00:32:42,759 --> 00:32:49,879
and sometimes you give us answers um and

832
00:32:46,278 --> 00:32:52,200
or even questions we need to ask I I'm I

833
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:54,639
represent South Los Angeles disadvantage

834
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:56,360
Community where will for defiance

835
00:32:54,638 --> 00:33:00,000
they're kicking black and brown kids out

836
00:32:56,359 --> 00:33:03,719
of school or or they're pres prescribing

837
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:06,038
Rin to take care of them we probably

838
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:08,000
need to do the research cuz these kids

839
00:33:06,038 --> 00:33:09,440
are experiencing PTSD because they live

840
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:13,480
in communities where they see people

841
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:15,480
shot drug deals going on um some kids

842
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:19,399
are ad and they want to prescrib them

843
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:21,120
harsh drugs maybe this is the answer is

844
00:33:19,398 --> 00:33:23,518
this industry the medical marijuana

845
00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:25,000
industry might be a better alternative

846
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:27,430
than what has been prescribed in the

847
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:33,398
past

848
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:35,759
[Applause]

849
00:33:33,398 --> 00:33:37,839
hi my name is Teresa Ryan I am the CEO

850
00:33:35,759 --> 00:33:39,798
of a organization called kid we're

851
00:33:37,839 --> 00:33:42,359
Collective here in Southern California

852
00:33:39,798 --> 00:33:45,679
and we prly treat pediatric patients

853
00:33:42,359 --> 00:33:47,879
with cancer epilepsy we have PTSD crom's

854
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:51,759
patients as well it's already very

855
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:53,360
expensive for us to grow extract and

856
00:33:51,759 --> 00:33:54,960
provide this medicine to our patients

857
00:33:53,359 --> 00:33:57,000
and the care that we also give them and

858
00:33:54,960 --> 00:34:00,200
helping them with our dosing protocols

859
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:01,638
my major concern are the licenses that

860
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:03,360
my company and other companies are now

861
00:34:01,638 --> 00:34:06,158
going to have to purchase in order to

862
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:08,519
still continue to do those growing

863
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:10,000
methodologies the extraction processes

864
00:34:08,519 --> 00:34:12,838
providing of this medicine to these

865
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,878
patients having parents that we deal

866
00:34:12,838 --> 00:34:16,559
with adop that have sick children

867
00:34:14,878 --> 00:34:18,199
they're very very strapped financially

868
00:34:16,559 --> 00:34:21,759
and they can barely AF afford the

869
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:24,678
medicine as it is now so can you tell me

870
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:26,399
do you guys have any idea or uh what the

871
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:28,159
pricing structure is going to be and how

872
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:29,960
is that going to affect the cost of the

873
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:32,639
medicine for these really sick people

874
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:32,639
who truly need

875
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:37,159
it I'll just I'll take we don't we don't

876
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:39,240
know what the fees and and and you have

877
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:41,000
to remember this this legislation number

878
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:43,358
one hasn't been signed yet so so if it

879
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,159
is signed by the governor that this it

880
00:34:43,358 --> 00:34:46,358
will go through a regulatory process

881
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:48,960
totally understand where you're coming

882
00:34:46,358 --> 00:34:51,039
from in the modern medical community we

883
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,559
have ways of dealing with with what

884
00:34:51,039 --> 00:34:54,639
you're dealing with there are programs

885
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:56,838
that allow for sick people to get

886
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:59,200
medicine it's not the intent of what

887
00:34:56,838 --> 00:35:01,279
we're doing what anyway to be punitive

888
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:04,598
in any way it was not meant it was not

889
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:06,200
meant to be that way but it it there are

890
00:35:04,599 --> 00:35:08,160
I believe there are protocols and things

891
00:35:06,199 --> 00:35:10,118
that need to be follow I mean I can't

892
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:12,199
tell you how many licenses and fees I

893
00:35:10,119 --> 00:35:14,559
had to to do to provide care for

894
00:35:12,199 --> 00:35:17,399
patients oftentimes care that I gave

895
00:35:14,559 --> 00:35:19,440
away and and and and continued to do

896
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:21,680
that for the 27 years I practiced

897
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:23,838
because it was the right thing to do so

898
00:35:21,679 --> 00:35:26,118
I personally subsidized a lot of care

899
00:35:23,838 --> 00:35:28,279
out of my own pocket um and would do it

900
00:35:26,119 --> 00:35:29,800
and would do it again in a heartbeat

901
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:31,519
um but there needs to be there need to

902
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:33,039
be mechanisms and there there there I

903
00:35:31,519 --> 00:35:34,358
believe there will that will happen and

904
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:36,679
I and I would challenge the I would

905
00:35:34,358 --> 00:35:39,000
challenge the industry to to create a

906
00:35:36,679 --> 00:35:40,799
foundation to do something to help in

907
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,119
situations like this with critically old

908
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,119
children and people who have chronic

909
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:46,320
diseases that really need management so

910
00:35:44,119 --> 00:35:47,838
I hear you and um I hope that you will

911
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,960
continue to correspond with us so that

912
00:35:47,838 --> 00:35:51,119
we can get we can get that um get that

913
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:53,119
message out there and take care of the

914
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:56,318
people who really need it and then just

915
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:59,160
to jump in of course prop 215 had the

916
00:35:56,318 --> 00:36:01,039
issue of access and affordable access

917
00:35:59,159 --> 00:36:03,480
and every time the bill got amended I

918
00:36:01,039 --> 00:36:06,400
was in my legisla coun my legislative

919
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:09,400
director's office making sure we have a

920
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:11,519
provision in the bills for a task force

921
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:13,318
that will be advising the imple the

922
00:36:11,519 --> 00:36:15,679
Bureau of Med medical marijuana

923
00:36:13,318 --> 00:36:17,239
regulation on its implementation and a

924
00:36:15,679 --> 00:36:19,519
specific charge of the task force is

925
00:36:17,239 --> 00:36:23,519
look at issues of accessibility as

926
00:36:19,519 --> 00:36:27,639
affects uh patients and uh their

927
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:28,960
caregivers so what I would say is I

928
00:36:27,639 --> 00:36:31,480
actually believing this issue of

929
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:33,039
affordable access is vitally important I

930
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:35,159
feel the work of putting together the

931
00:36:33,039 --> 00:36:37,838
bill is a mammoth work a mammoth

932
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:39,559
undertaking tremendous but this issue

933
00:36:37,838 --> 00:36:41,799
has been on sort of my personal radar

934
00:36:39,559 --> 00:36:44,599
screen and I just made sure that at

935
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:46,079
every iteration that language stayed in

936
00:36:44,599 --> 00:36:48,519
it's moved around a little bit exactly

937
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:52,200
how it's phrased but the ACC you know

938
00:36:48,519 --> 00:36:54,039
the accessibility and for patients is an

939
00:36:52,199 --> 00:36:55,639
element of the ongoing work of this

940
00:36:54,039 --> 00:36:56,838
study thing so that's something you're

941
00:36:55,639 --> 00:36:59,000
going to want to follow and when we're

942
00:36:56,838 --> 00:37:00,829
done I can give you the site thank you

943
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:04,400
thank you so

944
00:37:00,829 --> 00:37:08,078
[Applause]

945
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:09,800
much I'm uh Frank Marino from mgic

946
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:11,880
marijuana Investment Company we invest

947
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:13,200
across the sector and have investments

948
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:15,960
in

949
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:18,199
distribution manufacturing fused

950
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:21,119
products and dispensaries and I'm

951
00:37:18,199 --> 00:37:24,358
curious to know just in summary what

952
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:26,559
this legislation will mean uh for those

953
00:37:24,358 --> 00:37:29,719
uh those companies in terms of uh

954
00:37:26,559 --> 00:37:29,719
compliance and keeping and

955
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:41,920
regulation Frank were you just to

956
00:37:40,039 --> 00:37:44,679
clarify are you talking about the like

957
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:47,280
the uh the

958
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:49,159
uh restrictions on on vertical

959
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:51,079
integration like you can't own certain

960
00:37:49,159 --> 00:37:55,078
types of licenses or what are you

961
00:37:51,079 --> 00:37:58,400
talking about specifically what uh what

962
00:37:55,079 --> 00:38:00,960
what sort of new compliance uh issues or

963
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:03,559
regulations are embedded in the bills uh

964
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:06,000
for those three categories distribution

965
00:38:03,559 --> 00:38:09,559
manufactures and fused products and

966
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:11,318
dispensors Visa in particular Visa the

967
00:38:09,559 --> 00:38:12,679
uh the federal guidelines in other words

968
00:38:11,318 --> 00:38:15,239
to the extent that these companies are

969
00:38:12,679 --> 00:38:18,239
in compliance with the new

970
00:38:15,239 --> 00:38:21,919
legislation how do you see that fold in

971
00:38:18,239 --> 00:38:24,358
and and Bing and strengthening the uh

972
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:25,639
the industry here in California I mean

973
00:38:24,358 --> 00:38:28,400
some quick observation on the

974
00:38:25,639 --> 00:38:30,480
manufacturer side some processes use

975
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:31,960
volatile solvent some don't there's a

976
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:33,920
different license depending upon what

977
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:36,480
style you have there is a licensing

978
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:38,240
requirement of Manufacturers on uh

979
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:40,880
Distributors and dispensing There Are

980
00:38:38,239 --> 00:38:42,358
Rules There are rules concerning Safety

981
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,640
and Security of the business premises

982
00:38:42,358 --> 00:38:46,279
with respect to

983
00:38:43,639 --> 00:38:48,318
dispensaries um transportation rules

984
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:50,880
between dispensaries end up getting

985
00:38:48,318 --> 00:38:52,800
regulated the Safe Harbor under

986
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:55,079
California law against prosecution

987
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,280
hinges upon being licensed so if you're

988
00:38:55,079 --> 00:38:58,318
in that space you're going to want to

989
00:38:56,280 --> 00:39:00,640
get licensed because that protect T you

990
00:38:58,318 --> 00:39:03,119
from the law enforcement side there are

991
00:39:00,639 --> 00:39:05,078
like 17 different licenses and they deal

992
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:08,160
with specialty cultivation small

993
00:39:05,079 --> 00:39:10,599
cultivation moderate cultivation there

994
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:12,559
there's there's quite a structure but

995
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:14,800
it's not like you throw a switch on

996
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:17,000
January 1st and it's in place it's going

997
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:20,640
to take time to roll out but I would

998
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:23,079
just say uh you know any one of us can

999
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:27,879
get you a style of bill print out which

1000
00:39:23,079 --> 00:39:29,280
is uh as as it amends current law so you

1001
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:31,519
can actually look at the bills as they

1002
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:34,040
went through and see set out on italics

1003
00:39:31,519 --> 00:39:35,239
what's new and you you carve out two

1004
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:38,119
hours of your time you kind of go

1005
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:41,879
through it you'll have a heck of a

1006
00:39:38,119 --> 00:39:44,880
bird so so my my staff wrote something

1007
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:49,318
out so to make it appear that I'm smart

1008
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:49,318
so the bill language was designed to

1009
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:54,000
create the Bill language was designed to

1010
00:39:51,679 --> 00:39:56,639
create a regulatory framework um that

1011
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,199
fit in with existing models in in in

1012
00:39:56,639 --> 00:40:00,239
other Industries and did as little

1013
00:39:58,199 --> 00:40:02,078
disrupt businesses that have been

1014
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:04,318
operating for decades in a manner that

1015
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:07,000
is consistent with sound policy there

1016
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:09,559
are some local jurisdiction such as city

1017
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:11,440
of San Jose um that require vertical

1018
00:40:09,559 --> 00:40:13,039
integration which means that each

1019
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:15,358
business must do cultivation

1020
00:40:13,039 --> 00:40:17,400
manufacturing dispensing at the same

1021
00:40:15,358 --> 00:40:19,838
time there's a concern from some

1022
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:22,200
stakeholders that allowing unrestricted

1023
00:40:19,838 --> 00:40:25,480
vertical integration will be problematic

1024
00:40:22,199 --> 00:40:28,159
for enforcement and Public Safety thus

1025
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:29,920
our bill does allow some grandfathering

1026
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:32,480
under specific conditions including

1027
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:35,760
cultivating manufacturing and dispensing

1028
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:38,318
prior to July 1 2015 in addition there

1029
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:40,560
is limited vertical integration allowed

1030
00:40:38,318 --> 00:40:43,679
under the confines of the bill we call

1031
00:40:40,559 --> 00:40:45,400
it the 314 model which allows an

1032
00:40:43,679 --> 00:40:47,358
individual who has no more than three

1033
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:49,358
dispensaries to also hold one

1034
00:40:47,358 --> 00:40:51,960
manufacturing license and up to four

1035
00:40:49,358 --> 00:40:53,759
acres of cultivations other than these

1036
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:55,519
exceptions the bill only allows for IND

1037
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:58,359
individuals who carry up to two license

1038
00:40:55,519 --> 00:41:01,358
types depending on the licensing again

1039
00:40:58,358 --> 00:41:03,920
applicants for testing licenses may only

1040
00:41:01,358 --> 00:41:07,279
hold a license in that categories

1041
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:09,838
Distributors may also only hold licenses

1042
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:11,960
and only transport and distribution not

1043
00:41:09,838 --> 00:41:14,759
cultivation manufacturing testing or

1044
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:16,720
dispensing this is to prevent diversion

1045
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:19,680
as

1046
00:41:16,719 --> 00:41:21,519
well just just to add one one quick

1047
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:23,399
thought on there there was actually some

1048
00:41:21,519 --> 00:41:25,000
some changes when the first

1049
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:27,960
grandfathering Clause he was speaking

1050
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:31,480
about um where do you he refer the city

1051
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:33,079
of San Jose the word was basically you

1052
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:36,199
could stay vertically integrated if the

1053
00:41:33,079 --> 00:41:37,560
ordinance required you uh we they

1054
00:41:36,199 --> 00:41:39,480
actually were able to change that and

1055
00:41:37,559 --> 00:41:42,318
they added uh they added the word

1056
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:45,280
required or allowed so it actually

1057
00:41:42,318 --> 00:41:47,318
expanded it out to any or any basically

1058
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:49,079
any any town where you've been given a

1059
00:41:47,318 --> 00:41:50,599
license if they allow you to be

1060
00:41:49,079 --> 00:41:52,480
vertically integrated and you're doing

1061
00:41:50,599 --> 00:41:53,720
it now you can maintain what you're

1062
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:57,039
doing

1063
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:58,439
now I I would just add that um you know

1064
00:41:57,039 --> 00:42:02,318
govern govern government in general is

1065
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:05,079
not terribly Innovative so

1066
00:42:02,318 --> 00:42:08,880
um that probably feel like cap feel like

1067
00:42:05,079 --> 00:42:10,119
Capt him OB obvious here but you know um

1068
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:12,240
yeah no it's we're not terribly

1069
00:42:10,119 --> 00:42:14,119
Innovative and so so you're going to see

1070
00:42:12,239 --> 00:42:16,000
as the regulatory process moves forward

1071
00:42:14,119 --> 00:42:18,519
especially around distribution

1072
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,318
Transportation um and the licensing it's

1073
00:42:18,519 --> 00:42:22,159
going to rely on things that are working

1074
00:42:20,318 --> 00:42:23,838
well we also have a governor who doesn't

1075
00:42:22,159 --> 00:42:26,358
really like the idea of creating new

1076
00:42:23,838 --> 00:42:28,960
divisions and things like that so every

1077
00:42:26,358 --> 00:42:32,279
the emphasis on on this process has been

1078
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:34,400
around on around using existing uh

1079
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:36,880
programs that work well so so

1080
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:39,400
distribution the the the the three tier

1081
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:41,240
system is was was discussed at great

1082
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:43,440
detail and that I know that puts people

1083
00:42:41,239 --> 00:42:45,479
who have vertical distribution uh in

1084
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:48,039
conflict with that but but you're going

1085
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:49,920
to see as we move forward a Reliance on

1086
00:42:48,039 --> 00:42:51,279
systems that work well and as you

1087
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,440
remember too the regulatory system

1088
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,640
process is going to take a couple of

1089
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:55,280
years so it's not going to happen

1090
00:42:53,639 --> 00:42:57,598
overnight which once again gives you

1091
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:59,040
that opportunity to to have input and

1092
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:02,280
that's why the the language for these

1093
00:42:59,039 --> 00:43:04,159
bills was much more specific until we

1094
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:06,040
got close to the end and when the

1095
00:43:04,159 --> 00:43:07,920
administration got involved with us

1096
00:43:06,039 --> 00:43:10,759
working with us online a lot of the

1097
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:13,240
specificity was in language went away

1098
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:14,599
because and and I get it I mean I get it

1099
00:43:13,239 --> 00:43:16,558
we kind of get wet to the language and

1100
00:43:14,599 --> 00:43:18,200
the issues we worked on and all the the

1101
00:43:16,559 --> 00:43:20,920
countless stakeholder meetings we had

1102
00:43:18,199 --> 00:43:22,519
with with everybody across the board um

1103
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:25,960
it like a parade in our offices quite

1104
00:43:22,519 --> 00:43:27,519
frankly um um but but the governor the

1105
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:29,599
governor's office his admin ation kind

1106
00:43:27,519 --> 00:43:32,199
of backed up and said okay we want

1107
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:33,720
something more basic around regulatory

1108
00:43:32,199 --> 00:43:35,118
because we want to this to evolve we

1109
00:43:33,719 --> 00:43:36,399
want to be able to create a system

1110
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:37,960
that's actually going to be able to work

1111
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:40,760
so

1112
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:43,119
so so my hope my hope is that it that it

1113
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:44,640
will and and and and you know that's why

1114
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:47,079
your input in the regulatory process is

1115
00:43:44,639 --> 00:43:47,078
going to be so

1116
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:55,119
valuable Jame Shaw um I'm a dispensary

1117
00:43:52,599 --> 00:43:57,200
operator in Los Angeles property and I

1118
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:59,800
also founded the union for medic

1119
00:43:57,199 --> 00:44:01,679
patients and aite corporated and it

1120
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:03,440
sounds as though you're the the

1121
00:44:01,679 --> 00:44:05,039
intendant and thank you by the way for

1122
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:07,639
your great effort this is a great piece

1123
00:44:05,039 --> 00:44:10,679
of work and my question is it seems as

1124
00:44:07,639 --> 00:44:14,039
though the intention is to license all

1125
00:44:10,679 --> 00:44:19,399
property organizations if that's

1126
00:44:14,039 --> 00:44:21,838
accurate um how to how do we rectify the

1127
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:25,160
conflict with the the rules of property

1128
00:44:21,838 --> 00:44:27,639
in terms of Permitting and transporting

1129
00:44:25,159 --> 00:44:29,920
and if it's not then how do we um

1130
00:44:27,639 --> 00:44:32,480
interface with the

1131
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:36,000
state being from Los

1132
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:39,559
Angeles and making my first call to the

1133
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:42,318
first bill or some of the first wording

1134
00:44:39,559 --> 00:44:44,960
eliminated La allog together and the

1135
00:44:42,318 --> 00:44:48,920
first calls were to the City attorney

1136
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:50,960
Michael furer um to to let him know that

1137
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:53,400
and he worked directly with the

1138
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:56,159
governor's office to try to come up with

1139
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:58,720
some solutions um I think they're still

1140
00:44:56,159 --> 00:45:02,318
working through that that um I know the

1141
00:44:58,719 --> 00:45:05,078
City attorney has specific ideas of what

1142
00:45:02,318 --> 00:45:06,679
he can and can't do uh I believe he

1143
00:45:05,079 --> 00:45:09,680
believes for example you may not be able

1144
00:45:06,679 --> 00:45:12,199
to license in the city of La we have to

1145
00:45:09,679 --> 00:45:15,519
work through that and and with measure d

1146
00:45:12,199 --> 00:45:17,118
uh with 134 there there now um we we

1147
00:45:15,519 --> 00:45:18,679
want to make sure that we ensure and I

1148
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:20,640
think on both ends both the city

1149
00:45:18,679 --> 00:45:24,960
attorney's office and the state we want

1150
00:45:20,639 --> 00:45:27,519
to make sure that after a certain time

1151
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:29,079
201617 it it doesn't become a major

1152
00:45:27,519 --> 00:45:31,358
problem where they they're not in

1153
00:45:29,079 --> 00:45:34,079
existence

1154
00:45:31,358 --> 00:45:36,480
anymore hi I'm Dr David Derman I'm the

1155
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:40,079
Executive Vice President of the American

1156
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:43,318
Academy of canid Medicine uh have some

1157
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:45,559
uh concerns uh but I was uh delighted to

1158
00:45:43,318 --> 00:45:49,480
hear that this is the beginning and not

1159
00:45:45,559 --> 00:45:51,040
uh the end um I guess my concern is is

1160
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:53,800
why this isn't being treated like any

1161
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:55,599
other medicine uh why didn't you just

1162
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:58,200
adopt the pharmacy regulations why

1163
00:45:55,599 --> 00:46:00,400
didn't you reschedule the sched to and

1164
00:45:58,199 --> 00:46:03,399
why didn't you put in $9 million like

1165
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:06,480
John bason sales did in 1999 to do

1166
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:07,820
research on on cancer I mean this is

1167
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:08,369
real

1168
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:10,480
[Music]

1169
00:46:08,369 --> 00:46:13,118
[Applause]

1170
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:14,480
medicine and I I look forward to working

1171
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:17,079
with a gentleman in the future I mean I

1172
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:19,199
think you've done a good start and I but

1173
00:46:17,079 --> 00:46:21,920
it's only a start I think

1174
00:46:19,199 --> 00:46:24,879
um wow it took us 19 years to get to

1175
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:26,200
where we are you know so it's going to

1176
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:27,760
take a little while it's going to take a

1177
00:46:26,199 --> 00:46:29,118
little while longer so I I appreciate

1178
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:31,800
the interest I mean I personally have a

1179
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:34,318
concern as a as a current and past

1180
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:35,920
medical provider so so you know this is

1181
00:46:34,318 --> 00:46:37,279
not this like you said this is the

1182
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:38,400
beginning not or this is I said the

1183
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:41,599
beginning this is the beginning not the

1184
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:43,760
end um we need we need people like you

1185
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:46,160
to help us um to move forward on this

1186
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:49,839
it's not it's not an oversight the issue

1187
00:46:46,159 --> 00:46:51,480
is so large so large we couldn't capture

1188
00:46:49,838 --> 00:46:53,119
everything all at once there will be

1189
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:54,639
cleanup legislation there will be

1190
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:57,559
opportunities to make things better

1191
00:46:54,639 --> 00:47:01,078
going forward um I introduced a bill

1192
00:46:57,559 --> 00:47:03,519
11:00 on uh September 11th because we're

1193
00:47:01,079 --> 00:47:06,400
looking at uh at banking regulations

1194
00:47:03,519 --> 00:47:08,159
we're be working with a a uh Board of

1195
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:09,599
Equalization member Fiona Ma on trying

1196
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:11,318
to move forward Bank some banking

1197
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:14,000
regulations so that this is not a cash

1198
00:47:11,318 --> 00:47:16,480
industry any longer um and which will be

1199
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:18,519
hugely valuable for everybody uh moving

1200
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:19,639
forward so so the these these kinds of

1201
00:47:18,519 --> 00:47:20,920
things we can't we couldn't think of

1202
00:47:19,639 --> 00:47:23,519
everything we couldn't get everything in

1203
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:25,240
there but we'll you know who knows next

1204
00:47:23,519 --> 00:47:27,400
year there may be 10 10 or 15 Bills

1205
00:47:25,239 --> 00:47:29,039
moving forward on this subject

1206
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:31,440
you know in a few minutes ago Jim

1207
00:47:29,039 --> 00:47:33,199
mentioned the word the movement towards

1208
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:36,519
legitimacy which I think this

1209
00:47:33,199 --> 00:47:39,279
constitutes a great vating forward on

1210
00:47:36,519 --> 00:47:41,838
legitimacy uh one of the most remarkable

1211
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:45,280
things on the subject was when our bills

1212
00:47:41,838 --> 00:47:48,358
reached the four the assembly in June uh

1213
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:52,319
we got a 62 to8 vote in

1214
00:47:48,358 --> 00:47:54,558
support of ab 266 off the assembly floor

1215
00:47:52,318 --> 00:47:57,719
so that means we had 14 or 17

1216
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:59,800
Republicans joining in support

1217
00:47:57,719 --> 00:48:01,759
so I think this the progress on

1218
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:03,559
legitimacy you chip away on that and

1219
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:05,400
other things will come it's sort of that

1220
00:48:03,559 --> 00:48:07,880
that island hopping argument you you

1221
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:10,240
advance The Edge others will come along

1222
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:12,000
I think you'll see more of that and I I

1223
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:15,078
want to say one thing I'm a firm

1224
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:17,119
believer in in incremental progress I

1225
00:48:15,079 --> 00:48:19,000
mean we could have gone to this huge

1226
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:20,599
huge I mean this was this is a big deal

1227
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,358
this is a big package but we could have

1228
00:48:20,599 --> 00:48:23,920
tried to Encompass everything and we

1229
00:48:22,358 --> 00:48:26,838
could have lost it we could have lost it

1230
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:28,519
all and so the reality is we now I

1231
00:48:26,838 --> 00:48:30,318
believe have a strong foothold to be

1232
00:48:28,519 --> 00:48:31,920
able to move forward on something and we

1233
00:48:30,318 --> 00:48:34,000
will build upon that for the next

1234
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:35,800
several years and so I would much rather

1235
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,760
have something that we could start with

1236
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:40,160
then lose it all and have to go back to

1237
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:42,280
Ground Zero like it happened time and

1238
00:48:40,159 --> 00:48:45,358
time again in this legislature so so

1239
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:48,400
while it's not perfect um we're not

1240
00:48:45,358 --> 00:48:50,639
done hello my name is Stephen MC I work

1241
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:52,240
with medican and I'm also a former

1242
00:48:50,639 --> 00:48:54,440
professor of political science and the

1243
00:48:52,239 --> 00:48:57,000
one law that we all have to follow is

1244
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:58,960
the law of unintended consequences and

1245
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,679
so in reading this legislation there's

1246
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:02,880
there's several things that I see that

1247
00:49:00,679 --> 00:49:04,639
are worrisome in terms of independent

1248
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:06,760
consequences the first one is the

1249
00:49:04,639 --> 00:49:08,558
distribution model is that in requiring

1250
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:11,119
all of the supply to go through a

1251
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:13,480
distributor somehow the supply chain for

1252
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:15,720
patients is going to be disrupted

1253
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:17,639
because of all the unilinear

1254
00:49:15,719 --> 00:49:20,358
unidirectional distribution that's going

1255
00:49:17,639 --> 00:49:23,440
on now so that's number one concern

1256
00:49:20,358 --> 00:49:25,318
number two is that there's going to be

1257
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:27,639
hundreds of millions of dollars people's

1258
00:49:25,318 --> 00:49:30,119
blood and treasure can be poured into

1259
00:49:27,639 --> 00:49:32,440
this regulatory process and if it's

1260
00:49:30,119 --> 00:49:34,200
delayed or if it doesn't work the

1261
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:35,240
citizens who have decided to get into

1262
00:49:34,199 --> 00:49:36,879
this are the ones who are going to

1263
00:49:35,239 --> 00:49:38,358
suffer by having to sustain their

1264
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:40,720
businesses while they don't have

1265
00:49:38,358 --> 00:49:42,759
permission to do that and then the third

1266
00:49:40,719 --> 00:49:45,558
thing is the taxation issue it's a

1267
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:48,200
medicine yet we tax it at 8% that's

1268
00:49:45,559 --> 00:49:50,200
borderline pable the only way we're

1269
00:49:48,199 --> 00:49:52,480
going to be able to keep the medical

1270
00:49:50,199 --> 00:49:54,679
cannabis regime in place is if there's a

1271
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:57,599
lower taxation rate for medical or no

1272
00:49:54,679 --> 00:49:59,558
taxation rate for medical ization has a

1273
00:49:57,599 --> 00:50:03,798
higher taxation rate and that will

1274
00:49:59,559 --> 00:50:06,480
sustain us in the medical model time so

1275
00:50:03,798 --> 00:50:08,440
my question to you is um what are you

1276
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:10,798
going to do as far as oversight to make

1277
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:12,760
sure that the regulatory system doesn't

1278
00:50:10,798 --> 00:50:15,679
damage us and the industry and can you

1279
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:18,240
commit to us that you'll if if there's a

1280
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:21,480
problem please defer to the current

1281
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:23,479
status quo rather than to the regulatory

1282
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:24,599
need to wrench it and make it right you

1283
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:28,358
understand what I'm

1284
00:50:24,599 --> 00:50:31,559
saying well this was a key part of the

1285
00:50:28,358 --> 00:50:34,199
266 strategy from day one we have one

1286
00:50:31,559 --> 00:50:37,599
agency the medical marijuana regulatory

1287
00:50:34,199 --> 00:50:39,159
board in DCA which is actually in charge

1288
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:41,599
early in the conversation people were

1289
00:50:39,159 --> 00:50:43,159
having agencies you know food nag is

1290
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:44,680
going to do this but it's an equal with

1291
00:50:43,159 --> 00:50:46,118
public health that's going to do this

1292
00:50:44,679 --> 00:50:48,679
and equal with the third agency going to

1293
00:50:46,119 --> 00:50:50,760
do this we we opted for the idea that

1294
00:50:48,679 --> 00:50:52,480
there's one agency in charge that the

1295
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:55,079
legislature could pursue oversight with

1296
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:57,719
directly the other piece of this was

1297
00:50:55,079 --> 00:51:00,000
using food and AEG and Public Health we

1298
00:50:57,719 --> 00:51:02,318
didn't want to have some somebody in a

1299
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,960
brand new agency purporting to come up

1300
00:51:02,318 --> 00:51:06,599
with the rules for ad because we felt

1301
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:09,119
that would lead to who knows where the

1302
00:51:06,599 --> 00:51:11,318
rules came from and not necessarily well

1303
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:14,280
founded in relation to how other a

1304
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:16,480
interests get dealt with so I would say

1305
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:18,720
the oversight issue is a vital one but

1306
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:20,679
we've got one a one lead agency that the

1307
00:51:18,719 --> 00:51:21,959
legislature can bring before bring

1308
00:51:20,679 --> 00:51:24,639
before Force to talk about

1309
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:26,079
implementation issues and the other ones

1310
00:51:24,639 --> 00:51:27,239
we we're bringing them in because of

1311
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:29,400
their expert

1312
00:51:27,239 --> 00:51:31,318
we would expect to see consistency with

1313
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:33,079
how they deal with similar issues in the

1314
00:51:31,318 --> 00:51:35,039
non-marijuana

1315
00:51:33,079 --> 00:51:36,400
setting I just I would just add that

1316
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:37,880
there hasn't been a there probably isn't

1317
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:39,160
a single piece of legislation never

1318
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:42,160
passed in the state of California that

1319
00:51:39,159 --> 00:51:44,159
didn't have unintended consequences so

1320
00:51:42,159 --> 00:51:46,480
so I mean and We Know It And we know it

1321
00:51:44,159 --> 00:51:48,000
so um so yeah we're I'm committed to

1322
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:49,280
make sure that it's right that it's

1323
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:52,039
right in the end and that the interests

1324
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:54,559
and concerns of patients are protected

1325
00:51:52,039 --> 00:51:56,119
um but it's going to be different it's

1326
00:51:54,559 --> 00:51:57,760
not going to be exactly the same as it

1327
00:51:56,119 --> 00:51:59,559
always happen has been and you need to

1328
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:02,520
understand and if we're going to that

1329
00:51:59,559 --> 00:52:04,920
move towards acceptance and Broad

1330
00:52:02,519 --> 00:52:08,639
acceptance by the the entire State of

1331
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:10,880
California is is there's a cost to that

1332
00:52:08,639 --> 00:52:13,239
I'll just quickly say they call it

1333
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:15,079
clean they call it cleanup language for

1334
00:52:13,239 --> 00:52:17,879
a

1335
00:52:15,079 --> 00:52:21,000
reason my name is Mayon and I'm an

1336
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:25,160
attorney and patient my question is

1337
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:25,159
about the amendment to 11

1338
00:52:25,519 --> 00:52:29,440
368775 the

1339
00:52:31,639 --> 00:52:38,239
attorney that's a section that concerns

1340
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:39,680
the collective uh it's what we refer to

1341
00:52:38,239 --> 00:52:42,719
as a collective or cooperative

1342
00:52:39,679 --> 00:52:45,558
cultivation defense it's the one that is

1343
00:52:42,719 --> 00:52:49,519
going to be is going to be rescinded one

1344
00:52:45,559 --> 00:52:53,319
year after licenses begin to be issued

1345
00:52:49,519 --> 00:52:57,880
um I assume that that uh that

1346
00:52:53,318 --> 00:53:00,079
that came about because um uh this

1347
00:52:57,880 --> 00:53:03,280
Collective or cooperative cultivation

1348
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:06,119
defense has been used by big

1349
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:09,359
dispensaries and that they were trying

1350
00:53:06,119 --> 00:53:12,640
to limit that something that's been

1351
00:53:09,358 --> 00:53:15,838
somewhat seen as an abuse and I was

1352
00:53:12,639 --> 00:53:19,318
wondering if that was a if that was the

1353
00:53:15,838 --> 00:53:22,199
effect of that and I was also wondering

1354
00:53:19,318 --> 00:53:25,519
if uh if be

1355
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:26,960
um maybe an unintended consequence of

1356
00:53:25,519 --> 00:53:28,759
the law is

1357
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:32,000
that

1358
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:35,280
um there's going to be that vertical

1359
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:38,599
integration requirement for everyone

1360
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:40,599
except for anyone that had um a license

1361
00:53:38,599 --> 00:53:45,519
prior uh to

1362
00:53:40,599 --> 00:53:47,960
2016 and if in that case um if your

1363
00:53:45,519 --> 00:53:51,358
perhaps some ordinances local ordinances

1364
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:54,599
even formalize vertical integration and

1365
00:53:51,358 --> 00:53:57,440
Collective Cooperative distribution into

1366
00:53:54,599 --> 00:54:00,798
their into their ordinances so in some

1367
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:05,000
cases the big the bigger dispensaries

1368
00:54:00,798 --> 00:54:07,079
will actually have they will still be

1369
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:10,880
operating as I see it they don't

1370
00:54:07,079 --> 00:54:13,280
necessarily need to get licenses um if

1371
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:16,200
they were operating uh for like

1372
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:19,160
cultivation licenses separate

1373
00:54:16,199 --> 00:54:21,679
from uh if they have to get licenses on

1374
00:54:19,159 --> 00:54:23,399
every step of the chain or if they're

1375
00:54:21,679 --> 00:54:25,358
not required to do that because they

1376
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:27,599
didn't have to do that before

1377
00:54:25,358 --> 00:54:29,679
2016 I'll take the first part of that

1378
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:31,318
this that language popped up in amano's

1379
00:54:29,679 --> 00:54:33,639
bill first last year it's not something

1380
00:54:31,318 --> 00:54:36,159
we were excited about um the thought

1381
00:54:33,639 --> 00:54:38,358
process behind it was though 2003 when

1382
00:54:36,159 --> 00:54:40,679
they originally wrote point that that

1383
00:54:38,358 --> 00:54:42,440
that entire section that was sort of a

1384
00:54:40,679 --> 00:54:43,798
compromise between law enforcement and

1385
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:46,240
The Advocates because they didn't want

1386
00:54:43,798 --> 00:54:49,199
to actually create regulations that

1387
00:54:46,239 --> 00:54:50,959
would sort of legitimize dispensaries so

1388
00:54:49,199 --> 00:54:53,159
basically what law enforcement said was

1389
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:54,960
fine they can exist but we're not going

1390
00:54:53,159 --> 00:54:56,399
to Define how they have to operate or

1391
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:57,838
work or things like this just saying

1392
00:54:56,400 --> 00:55:00,798
these collectives can exist and that was

1393
00:54:57,838 --> 00:55:02,119
their kind of um that was their offer

1394
00:55:00,798 --> 00:55:04,719
and that's what got the B the bill

1395
00:55:02,119 --> 00:55:06,240
through in 2003 what these the problem

1396
00:55:04,719 --> 00:55:09,159
is is that is what's kind of created the

1397
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:11,558
gray area which allows Harborside and

1398
00:55:09,159 --> 00:55:13,159
some mother with with three plants in

1399
00:55:11,559 --> 00:55:15,240
her backyard and her neighbors to they

1400
00:55:13,159 --> 00:55:17,358
all operate under that one section and

1401
00:55:15,239 --> 00:55:19,159
so they needed to be a to be able to fix

1402
00:55:17,358 --> 00:55:21,119
that and so they did what they wanted to

1403
00:55:19,159 --> 00:55:23,199
do you know back in 2003 is they're

1404
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:24,519
going to actually create rules now so

1405
00:55:23,199 --> 00:55:26,838
the the thought process was we're going

1406
00:55:24,519 --> 00:55:29,559
to create this stack of rules rules and

1407
00:55:26,838 --> 00:55:32,038
regulations and take out the gray area

1408
00:55:29,559 --> 00:55:34,119
and and put in the actual rules and that

1409
00:55:32,039 --> 00:55:35,319
was the thought process it wasn't to

1410
00:55:34,119 --> 00:55:37,079
allow one group to be vertically

1411
00:55:35,318 --> 00:55:39,358
integrated or not it was they were going

1412
00:55:37,079 --> 00:55:41,280
to remove the gray area with with black

1413
00:55:39,358 --> 00:55:44,038
and white rules unless you guys want to

1414
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:47,200
speak to no I think that's I think

1415
00:55:44,039 --> 00:55:51,280
that's I think that's exactly it

1416
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:54,118
so only Pati only able to grow for

1417
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:57,519
themselves and by themselves and not

1418
00:55:54,119 --> 00:55:57,519
other than the

1419
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:09,119
there

1420
00:56:06,318 --> 00:56:12,279
was no there was case law before that

1421
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:15,000
which clarified that people could could

1422
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:16,760
collectively grow as a group and it's

1423
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:20,798
not the Minch case it's a different case

1424
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:24,359
before that but so people from 25 they

1425
00:56:20,798 --> 00:56:26,559
can grow in groups what what what 77

1426
00:56:24,358 --> 00:56:28,838
five did was put it in law and clarify

1427
00:56:26,559 --> 00:56:30,680
it so you still have the protections you

1428
00:56:28,838 --> 00:56:32,480
under have under 215 that doesn't get

1429
00:56:30,679 --> 00:56:34,358
changed but what there are changing is

1430
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:36,318
sort of the gray area where it just says

1431
00:56:34,358 --> 00:56:38,838
you can't operate without any sort of

1432
00:56:36,318 --> 00:56:40,719
rules or regulations attached to it or

1433
00:56:38,838 --> 00:56:42,440
that that was the thought process and it

1434
00:56:40,719 --> 00:56:44,639
wasn't necessarily us but that was just

1435
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:46,480
the conversations we we've had with with

1436
00:56:44,639 --> 00:56:49,199
the uh with law enforcement people who

1437
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:50,039
are working on that issue and and first

1438
00:56:49,199 --> 00:56:51,439
of all I want to thank you for your

1439
00:56:50,039 --> 00:56:52,799
questions I don't mean I wasn't being

1440
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:54,280
didn't mean to be flipping I often do

1441
00:56:52,798 --> 00:56:57,759
that I often say things I really regret

1442
00:56:54,280 --> 00:57:01,160
later but it's just who I am um

1443
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:04,200
but um but like that one like that one

1444
00:57:01,159 --> 00:57:07,000
yeah like that one like that one

1445
00:57:04,199 --> 00:57:09,719
so we're in the same boat so you know

1446
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:11,559
it's whatever whatever so um but but I

1447
00:57:09,719 --> 00:57:13,078
think you know to to part partly to

1448
00:57:11,559 --> 00:57:15,440
Nate's point which which may not come

1449
00:57:13,079 --> 00:57:17,640
out there is a there is a feeling among

1450
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:19,119
law enforcement that that parts of the

1451
00:57:17,639 --> 00:57:21,598
collective model have been grossly

1452
00:57:19,119 --> 00:57:24,119
abused and so that's where part of this

1453
00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:26,240
conversation came from that's that's

1454
00:57:24,119 --> 00:57:28,400
that's what my folks that I talked to

1455
00:57:26,239 --> 00:57:30,199
law enforcement feel like has happened

1456
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:31,880
whether whether and and when you're

1457
00:57:30,199 --> 00:57:33,279
trying to craft something like this

1458
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:34,519
you're trying to work with lots of

1459
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:36,200
different stakeholders to come to

1460
00:57:34,519 --> 00:57:38,280
Solutions and so there has there there

1461
00:57:36,199 --> 00:57:41,759
has was a feeling that that in some

1462
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:43,798
areas um that it was grossly abused and

1463
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:46,240
I do think that accessibility working

1464
00:57:43,798 --> 00:57:48,838
group will deal with will be looking at

1465
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:51,199
that issue of are there people who

1466
00:57:48,838 --> 00:57:54,038
arguably under prop 25 clearly should

1467
00:57:51,199 --> 00:57:56,439
have ready access and are finding

1468
00:57:54,039 --> 00:57:57,760
barriers so I sort of think that is at

1469
00:57:56,440 --> 00:58:01,000
the end of the day sort of behind your

1470
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:03,200
question and as I say we made clear that

1471
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:05,519
never dropped out of the bill that is an

1472
00:58:03,199 --> 00:58:07,399
element we didn't solve every problem

1473
00:58:05,519 --> 00:58:09,880
but we kept a spotlight on certain ones

1474
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:12,798
we want to keep paying attention

1475
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:14,880
to and and finally you know it was never

1476
00:58:12,798 --> 00:58:18,159
nothing that we did on anywhere along

1477
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:20,240
the way is meant to be perceived as

1478
00:58:18,159 --> 00:58:23,159
punitive towards patients it's not that

1479
00:58:20,239 --> 00:58:26,239
way at all quite the opposite quite the

1480
00:58:23,159 --> 00:58:27,639
opposite excellent that's it um I've

1481
00:58:26,239 --> 00:58:32,159
been told we were supposed to

1482
00:58:27,639 --> 00:58:33,798
stop SW me okay a third question thank

1483
00:58:32,159 --> 00:58:37,480
you thank you my name is

1484
00:58:33,798 --> 00:58:39,079
swam I'm from leville I'm a grower and

1485
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:41,358
so far no one's been speaking for the

1486
00:58:39,079 --> 00:58:43,280
grower so I'm a member of the Menino

1487
00:58:41,358 --> 00:58:45,679
Canabis policy Council and we've been

1488
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:48,960
working trying to get regulations from

1489
00:58:45,679 --> 00:58:50,919
The Growers point of view and as Ola

1490
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:53,039
said recently without the grower you

1491
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:55,318
don't have anything and we're all

1492
00:58:53,039 --> 00:58:57,240
concerned about prices for patients but

1493
00:58:55,318 --> 00:58:59,759
I'm really concern about maintaining

1494
00:58:57,239 --> 00:59:01,798
lifestyle for The Growers and I don't

1495
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:05,039
know how many thousand Growers there are

1496
00:59:01,798 --> 00:59:07,199
in assembly M Woods District but very

1497
00:59:05,039 --> 00:59:09,640
many and my calculations are that

1498
00:59:07,199 --> 00:59:12,719
cannabis brings in between two and6

1499
00:59:09,639 --> 00:59:15,920
billion dollars into mesino County every

1500
00:59:12,719 --> 00:59:18,598
year and that's just meino County so far

1501
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:21,318
so my question really is you're phasing

1502
00:59:18,599 --> 00:59:23,880
out cooperative and Collective

1503
00:59:21,318 --> 00:59:26,318
definitions but within the agriculture

1504
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:28,760
there is such a thing as an agricultural

1505
00:59:26,318 --> 00:59:31,519
op and I think the only defense for

1506
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:34,400
Growers is in fact going to be members

1507
00:59:31,519 --> 00:59:36,480
of an agricultural Co-op will that be

1508
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:38,280
possible in this new legislation because

1509
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:40,679
it's definitely under the agricultural

1510
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:43,680
rules that we supposedly as cultivators

1511
00:59:40,679 --> 00:59:45,239
going under that is that is my intention

1512
00:59:43,679 --> 00:59:47,279
absolutely okay then the other thing is

1513
00:59:45,239 --> 00:59:49,639
are we going to be able to make a

1514
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:52,640
profit there's nothing that stops you

1515
00:59:49,639 --> 00:59:52,639
now

1516
00:59:56,519 --> 01:00:01,159
and I would ask you I would ask you and

1517
00:59:58,838 --> 01:00:03,358
everybody else who's cultivating will

1518
01:00:01,159 --> 01:00:06,199
you do it with respect for environmental

1519
01:00:03,358 --> 01:00:08,639
laws will you use water that belongs to

1520
01:00:06,199 --> 01:00:10,399
you will you be careful with fertilizers

1521
01:00:08,639 --> 01:00:13,279
and pesticides will you respect the

1522
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:15,760
environment mcpc and that's and that's

1523
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:18,519
and that's that's my ask I am registered

1524
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:20,920
as clean green with Chris hook good and

1525
01:00:18,519 --> 01:00:23,559
I have water I am trying at the most of

1526
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:26,639
my ability to comply and the fact of the

1527
01:00:23,559 --> 01:00:30,640
matter is it's a lifestyle

1528
01:00:26,639 --> 01:00:32,838
and hum andd Tri we have a lifestyle we

1529
01:00:30,639 --> 01:00:35,920
have a culture it's been developing over

1530
01:00:32,838 --> 01:00:37,838
60 years and you all benefit from it and

1531
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:40,559
we just want to make sure that we are

1532
01:00:37,838 --> 01:00:42,318
recognized we've supported Menino County

1533
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:45,319
for the last 30 years when the L

1534
01:00:42,318 --> 01:00:47,759
industry went bankr so please give us

1535
01:00:45,318 --> 01:00:50,730
respect and let us grow and we will

1536
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:58,710
comply if you don't make it to H us

1537
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:58,710
[Applause]

1538
01:00:59,639 --> 01:01:04,879
[Music]

1539
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:04,880
and on that note we
