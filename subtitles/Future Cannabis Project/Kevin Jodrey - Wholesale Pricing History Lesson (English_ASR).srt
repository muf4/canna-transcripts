2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:14,548
the comeback of the traditional market

3
00:00:11,939 --> 00:00:16,890
prices in California and how that's

4
00:00:14,548 --> 00:00:19,170
impacting the industry as a whole both

5
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:21,778
the regulated industry and the

6
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:26,099
traditional industry also known as the

7
00:00:21,778 --> 00:00:28,410
black market industry so the pricing has

8
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:30,778
been a rollercoaster ride in the last

9
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:33,600
few years and it's it's kind of been a

10
00:00:30,778 --> 00:00:36,539
long roller coaster ride over the last

11
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:39,660
couple decades so can you talk a bit

12
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:41,149
about pricing and how you've seen it

13
00:00:39,659 --> 00:00:45,869
change

14
00:00:41,149 --> 00:00:48,299
well the pricing pricing never recovered

15
00:00:45,869 --> 00:00:50,909
from the 2008 financial crisis in the

16
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:54,390
financial crisis of 2008 when we've lost

17
00:00:50,909 --> 00:00:56,099
all the homes prices went at that point

18
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:59,820
they were right you know indoor good

19
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:02,160
outdoor 39-41 and then as soon as the

20
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,960
crash happened all these individuals

21
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:06,329
across the US that had upside-down

22
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,530
mortgages suddenly started to cultivate

23
00:01:06,329 --> 00:01:08,640
in these homes because they didn't want

24
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:10,019
to lose their home so all of a sudden

25
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,689
people who were really any cannabis

26
00:01:10,019 --> 00:01:16,228
became very pro cannabis and over a 20

27
00:01:12,688 --> 00:01:18,629
month period prices went from 39 to 19

28
00:01:16,228 --> 00:01:21,599
so we dropped $2,000 over 20 months and

29
00:01:18,629 --> 00:01:24,390
they came back up around 20 to 24 at

30
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:27,089
home for a while but we lost almost you

31
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:29,400
know to half the value for 2008 to 2010

32
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:32,520
half the value of cannabis wiped out so

33
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:36,390
you know the peak of 5 to 6 grand back

34
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:38,819
rate at camp era you know 84 85 86 we

35
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:41,009
get into the 90s and it's holding heavy

36
00:01:38,819 --> 00:01:42,929
at 40 you know that that high 40s you

37
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:44,280
getting into the 215 era when all of a

38
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:47,310
sudden people could start to cultivate

39
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,750
prices came down because more people

40
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:50,310
could cultivate in general but you had

41
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:51,780
more diversity you had a lot more

42
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:53,250
different products coming out there's a

43
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:54,689
lot that many people could cultivate and

44
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:57,269
move it into dispensaries could get it

45
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:59,688
into stores so you started to see a lot

46
00:01:57,269 --> 00:02:02,158
more different stuff movement of our and

47
00:01:59,688 --> 00:02:05,398
different things helped prices and small

48
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:08,399
quantities and then it goes into the

49
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:11,188
2008 crisis that drops us down by half

50
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:14,250
again so now when the twos we get into

51
00:02:11,188 --> 00:02:16,289
post or pre legalization and pounds were

52
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:17,818
stacking up like cordwood because

53
00:02:16,289 --> 00:02:19,590
everybody was producer two or three

54
00:02:17,818 --> 00:02:21,750
thousand pounds so people talk about how

55
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:23,188
legalization wiped out the money I'm

56
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:25,500
like they wiped it out through lack of

57
00:02:23,188 --> 00:02:26,969
enforcement and I've always believed

58
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:29,280
that lack of enforcement was a complete

59
00:02:26,969 --> 00:02:30,449
strategy he capitalized the cultivator

60
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,289
so that by the time of legalization

61
00:02:30,449 --> 00:02:35,548
happened there would be no money left

62
00:02:33,289 --> 00:02:37,108
because I remember three years ago that

63
00:02:35,549 --> 00:02:38,938
I was going to see I'd go to visit

64
00:02:37,109 --> 00:02:40,920
friends and then literally be 2,000

65
00:02:38,938 --> 00:02:42,239
pounds stacked up in the house and I

66
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:44,009
mean I've never seen that in my life I'm

67
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,230
like that that's that's a ton in your

68
00:02:44,009 --> 00:02:47,638
living room doesn't really move anything

69
00:02:46,229 --> 00:02:49,560
and everything was cheap pounds of

70
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:52,560
foreigner bucks this was a couple years

71
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:54,750
back so the legal pylons had plummeted

72
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,310
in value because there was so many of

73
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:59,098
them because everybody was punching out

74
00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:02,128
10,000 20,000 square-foot outdoor

75
00:02:59,098 --> 00:03:04,078
illegal grouse and that's just what

76
00:03:02,128 --> 00:03:06,598
happened was we over produced and with

77
00:03:04,079 --> 00:03:08,340
no enforcement cannabis isn't valuable

78
00:03:06,598 --> 00:03:09,719
canvas is valuable when there's

79
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:11,158
enforcement otherwise that you're

80
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:14,189
growing tomatoes you're growing an Ag

81
00:03:11,158 --> 00:03:17,189
crop and if you do it correctly then you

82
00:03:14,189 --> 00:03:19,848
can pretty much succeed so when when

83
00:03:17,189 --> 00:03:23,400
everybody is able to do this prices have

84
00:03:19,848 --> 00:03:25,948
there's nothing to do but fall so prices

85
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,389
fall and then the legalization comes in

86
00:03:25,949 --> 00:03:30,060
and I'm still a proponent of

87
00:03:27,389 --> 00:03:31,590
legalization because to me as someone

88
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:34,979
who's in medical cannabis for as many

89
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:37,650
years as I was I saw too many people

90
00:03:34,979 --> 00:03:39,810
come in to cannabis too late to fight

91
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:41,330
for their health that the shame and the

92
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:42,830
stigma

93
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:45,080
did them from getting into Canada's

94
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:46,820
therapy quick enough and I watched too

95
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:48,140
many people wither and die in front of

96
00:03:46,819 --> 00:03:50,030
me and I just said listen legalization

97
00:03:48,139 --> 00:03:52,009
has to happen or you gonna end up having

98
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:55,849
all these people continue this process

99
00:03:52,009 --> 00:03:58,909
and so my financial stability is less

100
00:03:55,849 --> 00:04:00,620
important than your daughter who can't

101
00:03:58,909 --> 00:04:03,500
get cannabis medicine and she has

102
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:06,200
epilepsy that gives her you know 60 60

103
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:09,590
tremors a day and I just believe that

104
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:10,879
still and I believe that then so I knew

105
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:14,030
that it was going to be tough to do what

106
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:18,108
we do but California did such a screw-up

107
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:21,470
job with the rollout of the regulations

108
00:04:18,108 --> 00:04:24,259
primarily with stores but you you had

109
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:25,880
12,000 outlets now you have 700 outlets

110
00:04:24,259 --> 00:04:27,500
and who knows how many we're gonna lose

111
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:29,629
over the next couple months with with

112
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:31,220
permitting but all of a sudden you lose

113
00:04:29,629 --> 00:04:34,909
a tremendous amount of your outlet to

114
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:36,620
move product that is also compounded by

115
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:37,730
many the stores or verticals are

116
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:40,879
connected to their own production

117
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:42,290
facilities too so really how many stores

118
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:44,240
do you really have in the state of

119
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:45,650
California to sell to not that many so

120
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:51,889
when you have more distributors and you

121
00:04:45,649 --> 00:04:53,418
do stores and the ability for the

122
00:04:51,889 --> 00:04:55,099
farmers to get product through the

123
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:57,529
system quick enough to get in there

124
00:04:55,100 --> 00:05:00,890
creates a situation where financially

125
00:04:57,529 --> 00:05:04,939
you're you getting hammered so right now

126
00:05:00,889 --> 00:05:06,769
I want to say what if we look at Oregon

127
00:05:04,939 --> 00:05:08,000
Oregon's the best model look at because

128
00:05:06,769 --> 00:05:10,219
really it reflects what we're going to

129
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,399
do here where you're looking at $8 AIT's

130
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:14,900
$60 once's and people always said well

131
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:16,189
people want to pay for quality and I'm

132
00:05:14,899 --> 00:05:18,319
like really so everybody's driving a

133
00:05:16,189 --> 00:05:20,569
Ferrari outside here right now no that's

134
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:23,949
a Chevrolet you pay for what you can

135
00:05:20,569 --> 00:05:27,290
afford and people don't realize that

136
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:31,099
we're we're consuming so much caustic

137
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:32,479
crappy material is food knowingly that

138
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:34,220
if you think they're all caught up in

139
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:35,990
their pesticides and you cannabis then

140
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:38,419
why black market sells so strong for so

141
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:39,500
long nobody required any tests then some

142
00:05:38,418 --> 00:05:43,159
states doing the tests illegal

143
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:44,540
Washington doesn't test pesticides no in

144
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,759
illegal cannabis and no pesticide

145
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:49,240
testing in Washington they can't

146
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:52,218
people all-time through third-party labs

147
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:53,838
bottom bottom line is that the the it's

148
00:05:52,218 --> 00:05:55,129
not something that we get caught up on

149
00:05:53,838 --> 00:05:56,870
here in California because it's so

150
00:05:55,129 --> 00:06:00,949
highly regulated but the truth is if I

151
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:03,528
drop the price it'll sell so the black

152
00:06:00,949 --> 00:06:05,749
market isn't all that lucrative either

153
00:06:03,528 --> 00:06:07,788
because ultimately especially here at

154
00:06:05,749 --> 00:06:09,800
Humboldt you got satellite imagery

155
00:06:07,788 --> 00:06:11,838
flocking down on you and you got

156
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:14,689
electrical monitoring occurring left and

157
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:18,050
right and you have you by electrical

158
00:06:14,689 --> 00:06:21,409
monitor any any any you if you pay over

159
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:23,930
ten thousand a year to the PG&amp;E and cash

160
00:06:21,408 --> 00:06:27,800
in any form over the whole fiscal year

161
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:30,319
they report that to the IRS so PG&amp;E not

162
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:31,788
works with the IRS the indoor got the

163
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,528
wrong indoor and then with Humboldt

164
00:06:31,788 --> 00:06:35,240
County three satellites flying over the

165
00:06:33,528 --> 00:06:36,588
top you all the time they're doing a

166
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:39,978
pretty good job at picking up these

167
00:06:36,588 --> 00:06:43,519
grows so it makes it difficult for

168
00:06:39,978 --> 00:06:47,568
people to produce product in any form

169
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:49,188
that works well the the product that

170
00:06:47,569 --> 00:06:50,419
you're seeing moving into the system I

171
00:06:49,189 --> 00:06:51,919
don't think it's coming from the black

172
00:06:50,418 --> 00:06:54,019
market traditionally it's coming from

173
00:06:51,918 --> 00:06:56,359
people who got permits that they can

174
00:06:54,019 --> 00:06:59,930
then say hey I lost half my farm to mold

175
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:01,459
I said that I harvested four hundred

176
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:03,499
pounds really our harvest is seven

177
00:07:01,459 --> 00:07:05,990
hundred and the farmers are basically

178
00:07:03,499 --> 00:07:07,699
happened to stick month weed into the

179
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:09,889
old traditional market whatever we want

180
00:07:07,699 --> 00:07:12,830
to call it nowadays so they can actually

181
00:07:09,889 --> 00:07:14,718
stay alive because the cost of the

182
00:07:12,829 --> 00:07:16,639
permitting was so expensive so you have

183
00:07:14,718 --> 00:07:19,189
the issue of no snores you have the

184
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:23,569
issue too many distributors you have the

185
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:25,159
issue of c1 which is what people didn't

186
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:27,199
realize is that you have to have this

187
00:07:25,158 --> 00:07:29,269
environmental control because otherwise

188
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:32,509
it's state level projects you have to

189
00:07:29,269 --> 00:07:34,968
have this certificate of environmental

190
00:07:32,509 --> 00:07:36,860
impact and humble went the hardest down

191
00:07:34,968 --> 00:07:37,610
then the whole state on it but it's also

192
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:39,020
because we have the most

193
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:41,749
environmentalists that well in a fire

194
00:07:39,019 --> 00:07:43,370
sue if it wasn't pushed so what you have

195
00:07:41,749 --> 00:07:45,620
is you have a situation where you have

196
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:48,050
multiple groups fighting over for what

197
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:49,610
should occur and because of that by the

198
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:51,230
time you're done as a farmer you've

199
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:54,830
already lost company here

200
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:57,710
worth of money in terms of you don't

201
00:07:54,829 --> 00:08:01,069
take you years of sales to recover the

202
00:07:57,709 --> 00:08:04,939
cost of the investment to build the farm

203
00:08:01,069 --> 00:08:06,439
to legal standards when you are I have

204
00:08:04,939 --> 00:08:08,029
no farmers that are excited moving

205
00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:09,439
products and like man I sold one hundred

206
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:12,109
and twenty four eighths I said that's

207
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:14,839
great you sold a pound you've got

208
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:17,000
another four hundred to go both of all

209
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:18,500
the outdoor pounds I see are just

210
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,790
getting into the system now I'm looking

211
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:22,730
at outdoor pounds that are hitting the

212
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:26,510
market right now in legal that were

213
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:29,629
harvested last October and so the delay

214
00:08:26,509 --> 00:08:31,759
from you cutting it to you getting into

215
00:08:29,629 --> 00:08:33,799
the testing lab to get it into

216
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,539
manufacturing process and to get into

217
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:38,719
the distributor to get it to the store

218
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:40,610
and then to get your money back if it's

219
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:42,410
a nightmare so most of the farmers are

220
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:44,570
forced to fight for their lives

221
00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:46,519
financially and utilize the old

222
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:49,010
traditional market but the Dritz from

223
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:51,529
market isn't booming money either so I

224
00:08:49,009 --> 00:08:54,409
mean like right now outdoor from last

225
00:08:51,529 --> 00:08:56,750
year you know eight hundred if it was

226
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:58,159
good you know you can go in dorm right

227
00:08:56,750 --> 00:09:00,139
now anywhere from like twelve to

228
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:02,059
eighteen they figured that the depths

229
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:03,980
this year should pull around eighteen

230
00:09:02,059 --> 00:09:05,599
it's like the the market for this is all

231
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:07,490
traditional market market right they

232
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,840
figure that the the depths are to come

233
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:12,860
in around eighteen because there's a

234
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:15,290
shortage of specific things though the

235
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:17,419
og packs are diminished but if you go to

236
00:09:15,289 --> 00:09:19,759
LA oh geez not hot in colonial form

237
00:09:17,419 --> 00:09:21,319
because it's over produced and so

238
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:23,090
depends what region you're in and what

239
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:26,120
you're moving and where you're moving it

240
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:29,180
but the bottom line is you're still

241
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:31,009
working on some low price products and

242
00:09:29,179 --> 00:09:32,269
traditional products you know I got

243
00:09:31,009 --> 00:09:33,889
hearing people are getting you know

244
00:09:32,269 --> 00:09:36,559
twenty four for some indoor and I know

245
00:09:33,889 --> 00:09:39,279
that there's some varietals and some

246
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:42,289
some certain companies that move at 3:34

247
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:43,459
but those companies are big and what

248
00:09:42,289 --> 00:09:45,439
they have is they have the vertical

249
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:47,509
model pretty much under control to where

250
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,430
when it leaves their grow it goes right

251
00:09:47,509 --> 00:09:51,139
through their supply chain quickly and

252
00:09:49,429 --> 00:09:53,179
then they have the ability to borrow

253
00:09:51,139 --> 00:09:54,919
with the stores to get shelf space

254
00:09:53,179 --> 00:09:57,379
because they're highly brand didn't have

255
00:09:54,919 --> 00:09:58,669
all the push and so it allows them to

256
00:09:57,379 --> 00:10:01,250
build a really different

257
00:09:58,669 --> 00:10:03,469
than any of the local farmers so most

258
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:07,129
people when you say farmer to me that

259
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:08,840
means you know owner operator anybody

260
00:10:07,129 --> 00:10:10,370
else to me I don't call on farm as I

261
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:12,139
call it commercial industrialists

262
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:14,149
because that's what you're using is a

263
00:10:12,139 --> 00:10:17,330
commercial industrial agricultural model

264
00:10:14,149 --> 00:10:18,829
where they control the supply chain and

265
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:20,150
that control the supply chain let them

266
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:22,610
get their product to the store quicker

267
00:10:20,149 --> 00:10:25,939
it lets the product be better in the jar

268
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:27,470
than ours we have to wait so many months

269
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:29,540
to get anything in if you're doing

270
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:31,580
pre-rolls god help you with those things

271
00:10:29,539 --> 00:10:36,139
set because by the time you open them

272
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:38,389
off their schwag right for how about for

273
00:10:36,139 --> 00:10:43,939
traditional market versus regulated

274
00:10:38,389 --> 00:10:46,689
market in in outdoor in February prices

275
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:51,080
in the traditional market seemed to

276
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:53,510
start going up again from that low that

277
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:55,790
they'd been at something like 8 they

278
00:10:53,509 --> 00:10:58,340
went from like you know 5 to 8 and then

279
00:10:55,789 --> 00:11:01,069
and then maybe even higher I've heard it

280
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:03,590
depends on what it is depends on what it

281
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:05,840
is and how long it is it's still pretty

282
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:08,240
low for the partners totally but it's

283
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:11,269
better than zero and it was at for a

284
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,799
couple years back the the prices that

285
00:11:11,269 --> 00:11:15,889
are going by the time you are done

286
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:17,539
getting paid after all your costs you

287
00:11:15,889 --> 00:11:19,909
know at least through the supply chain

288
00:11:17,539 --> 00:11:21,740
some of the outdoor units are going six

289
00:11:19,909 --> 00:11:23,719
to six to eight hundred and that's

290
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:25,850
through normal markets but then you have

291
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:28,399
to add in your permitting colossal

292
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:30,649
canopy right so by the time you donated

293
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:33,259
market prices they don't work you make a

294
00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:35,720
couple of Espoo compared to what farmers

295
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:37,730
won based on how much they've invested

296
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:39,710
in determining cost hold on has the

297
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:41,779
ability to get loads or anything and

298
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:44,330
meanwhile the traditional market I've

299
00:11:41,779 --> 00:11:47,929
heard some farmers have gotten you know

300
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:50,210
a thousand to even twelve hundred in the

301
00:11:47,929 --> 00:11:52,969
next year has what is the left because

302
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:56,180
we're in that period of the season where

303
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:59,259
there's a shortage totally but what you

304
00:11:56,179 --> 00:12:01,879
what you have to is that regardless

305
00:11:59,259 --> 00:12:03,439
customers make the decision people were

306
00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:04,759
surprised that there would be a shortage

307
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,730
because there's been all this talk of

308
00:12:04,759 --> 00:12:08,250
oversupply but all the heavy regulation

309
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:11,430
has

310
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:14,220
made a lot of farmers with it has but

311
00:12:11,429 --> 00:12:16,199
that's okay as far as the the that

312
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:18,000
cannabis industry wasn't built for the

313
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:20,009
farmer it was built for tax collection

314
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,690
like all industries are all industries

315
00:12:20,009 --> 00:12:24,809
are based off of how much money can be

316
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:26,460
derived from tax so America favors three

317
00:12:24,809 --> 00:12:29,339
companies paying the million dollars in

318
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:31,530
tax versus 300,000 companies creating a

319
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:33,330
billion dollars in tax and so if you had

320
00:12:31,529 --> 00:12:34,919
looked at the economy of the nation

321
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:37,290
prior to this you would have said I got

322
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:39,809
you I see the pattern it's just how this

323
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:41,519
works the customer doesn't care they

324
00:12:39,809 --> 00:12:43,289
don't care about how much money it took

325
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,360
you to get your permit when you go to

326
00:12:43,289 --> 00:12:46,769
this store and you go buy food do you go

327
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,570
in and get a hold of the company and say

328
00:12:46,769 --> 00:12:50,879
how much did you have to spend to make

329
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:53,670
this because I'm gonna pay you more now

330
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:56,340
you want the damn product for three then

331
00:12:53,669 --> 00:12:58,229
you pay the minimal if you can and so

332
00:12:56,340 --> 00:13:00,090
that for me I'm seeing you know like I

333
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:01,769
said eight to twelve is in normal up to

334
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:02,940
up does maybe eighteen for the depths

335
00:13:01,769 --> 00:13:06,090
this year will come out that's on the

336
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:07,950
traditional the the regulated market is

337
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:09,860
less because for most of the Sun growing

338
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:12,120
groups they don't have distribution and

339
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:14,850
if you get into some of the distributors

340
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:16,379
that can distribute the Sun grown they

341
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:18,690
have to take a chunk of that money to

342
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:20,309
make their money and then by the time

343
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:22,110
you're done what do you really make in

344
00:13:20,309 --> 00:13:24,209
per unit but someone asked me I'll get

345
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:26,370
because I have I have a half acre canopy

346
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:27,420
right and so someone said what are you

347
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:30,299
going to do this year and I said I

348
00:13:27,419 --> 00:13:31,979
probably gonna grow crude because it'll

349
00:13:30,299 --> 00:13:34,079
allow me at least just to cultivate and

350
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:35,730
then get it blown and then I realized

351
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:39,480
that by the time I was done paying the

352
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:41,250
excise for the the acreage and then I

353
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:43,080
was done paying for the distribution

354
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:45,750
costs but the done pay in the process

355
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:47,580
and manufacturing costs have to pay all

356
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:49,460
the labor to create the product in terms

357
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:51,600
of the workers for the whole season I

358
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:54,149
realized that if I just paid him to

359
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:57,659
thirteen five for the through the

360
00:13:54,149 --> 00:13:59,308
state permit and I paid him the 2500 for

361
00:13:57,659 --> 00:14:02,458
the water oil so that said it's 15 grand

362
00:13:59,308 --> 00:14:04,499
I lost 15 grand on getting the permit

363
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:08,219
and it didn't grow I would do

364
00:14:04,499 --> 00:14:09,990
financially better than if I grew it and

365
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:11,910
went through the whole process and had

366
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:13,919
to play the game in October November

367
00:14:11,909 --> 00:14:16,528
December because when exactly will I get

368
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:18,509
my money back so I'm gonna come out of

369
00:14:16,528 --> 00:14:21,360
the pocket every dollar I have left in

370
00:14:18,509 --> 00:14:23,220
my life so that I can maybe make it back

371
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,829
I'd rather come out of the pocket 15

372
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:28,110
grand which is still too damn much to

373
00:14:25,828 --> 00:14:29,519
have to give out right now then have to

374
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:31,879
come out of the pocket a hundred grand

375
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:35,610
minimum to get this project through

376
00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:38,789
without having to do diversion and for

377
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:41,220
me I would rather bleed the money on the

378
00:14:38,789 --> 00:14:43,379
permit in the short term then risk the

379
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:45,629
diversion on the farm because

380
00:14:43,379 --> 00:14:47,999
fundamentally the amount of money I have

381
00:14:45,629 --> 00:14:51,449
in the farm makes it to where if I get

382
00:14:47,999 --> 00:14:53,879
caught I lose that permit permits you

383
00:14:51,448 --> 00:14:55,649
can't get again so this is a liquor

384
00:14:53,879 --> 00:14:57,509
license and you're gonna have to figure

385
00:14:55,649 --> 00:14:59,220
out how to hold it because right now

386
00:14:57,509 --> 00:15:01,860
selling to underage kids at the school

387
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:03,959
doesn't work and that's how that's how I

388
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:06,899
buy them I'm looking at myself where

389
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:10,068
when you run the numbers there is almost

390
00:15:06,899 --> 00:15:12,990
no real money and so most farmers are

391
00:15:10,068 --> 00:15:16,078
almost forced to go back into the old

392
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:19,678
markets to try to stay active and for me

393
00:15:16,078 --> 00:15:21,299
I would rather go get a job and which

394
00:15:19,678 --> 00:15:23,938
I'm doing I've taken on more work than

395
00:15:21,299 --> 00:15:25,620
normal in consulting so that it allows

396
00:15:23,938 --> 00:15:27,949
me then just to take the money I make

397
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:40,548
and consult them to keep the farm alive

398
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:40,549
