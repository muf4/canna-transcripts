14

15
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:34,399
longest surviving federal medical

16
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:35,519
cannabis patient in the united states

17
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,439
the federal government's been giving me

18
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,879
marijuana for the last 28 years i

19
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:42,640
receive over 120 000 medical cannabis

20
00:00:40,878 --> 00:00:43,679
cigarettes so far from the federal

21
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,119
government

22
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:47,039
now i've always tried to be very

23
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:48,558
responsible if you see me on any of my

24
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,559
documentaries or in the news shows you

25
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:51,519
usually see me with a coat and tie on

26
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:53,439
whenever

27
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,800
you talking about medical cannabis you

28
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:56,479
want to look better than the crowd that

29
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:59,640
you're with therefore i could dress like

30
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:59,640
this today

31
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,359
the point is you've got to be

32
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,760
responsible if you're going to use

33
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,680
cannabis in whatever way you use it and

34
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,240
if you don't use it responsibly then

35
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:13,520
you're giving me a bad name

36
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:15,519
i don't like that so make sure you know

37
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:17,039
what cannabis does to you

38
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:18,319
and if you it puts you in a position

39
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,680
where you're lethargic and don't feel

40
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:21,199
like doing something

41
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,080
then don't do it don't put yourself in

42
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,118
that position when you have to do

43
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:24,840
something

44
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:27,359
if it makes you

45
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,040
creative makes you a better person and

46
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:31,200
your thoughts well then when you've got

47
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,479
work to do nothing wrong with it you've

48
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,520
got to know what it does to you you've

49
00:01:32,478 --> 00:01:35,519
got to be responsible

50
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:39,839
now

51
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,879
i came all the way from fort lauderdale

52
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,640
florida

53
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:44,719
this is the first time

54
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,680
that i've been here in this crowd and i

55
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:49,280
must say i'm very impressed so i do hope

56
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,560
that they're able to carry this on and

57
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,320
carry it next year and the year after

58
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,879
that in many years to come but it's

59
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:55,919
going to be with all your help out here

60
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:57,359
now

61
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,200
being the longest surviving federal

62
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:00,959
patient i realized that the history of

63
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,840
the medical marijuana movement i helped

64
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:06,000
start i planted the seeds in the early

65
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,280
70s for what you see here today in all

66
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,878
of the country

67
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,038
and i realized

68
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:12,318
that if i died all that information

69
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,759
would die with me

70
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:15,199
that wasn't fair

71
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:16,878
so i've been very fortunate to be able

72
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:18,318
to get a federal patient to be able to

73
00:02:16,878 --> 00:02:20,000
win the struggles the trials and

74
00:02:18,318 --> 00:02:22,318
tribulations it just didn't happen

75
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,560
overnight it was a 10-year struggle so i

76
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:26,479
sat down and i wrote a book

77
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,199
the book is called my medicine because

78
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:31,119
that's what it is my medicine

79
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:33,359
now i'm hoping that this book will teach

80
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,039
the american public that they don't have

81
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,959
the face of when they think about

82
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:38,079
marijuana they think of some

83
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,598
no good

84
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,879
whatever person sitting back just

85
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:43,598
wanting to get high

86
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:45,518
now here i am in a coat and tie now i'm

87
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:46,799

90
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:54,400

91
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:56,000
responsible person

92

40 percent of the country right now

105
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:23,120

is a picture of freedom

112
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,640
of being able to see people

113
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:38,238
that can do what they want to do

114
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:40,000
