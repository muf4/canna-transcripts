the ones right now who screamed when i

116
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:47,680

117
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,280
the ones that the war on marijuana is

118
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,680

marijuana and now in your life when

129

131
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:24,960

132
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,759
moment of freedom this is the generation

that will legalize marijuana in your

136
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:36,800
lifetime

137
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,759
my generation dropped that ball

138
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:46,000
my generation we thought back in the

139
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:49,038
1970s we're gonna have this [Â __Â ]

legalized by 1975

141
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:53,318
that didn't work

142
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:57,359
1979 that didn't work

143
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:59,680
1985 that took on and on

144
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,800
