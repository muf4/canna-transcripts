00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:59,399

marijuana card holder for no

25
00:01:14,129 --> 00:01:21,959
consideration there's not even a charge

26
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:24,450
like that anywhere heard of but we took

27
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:26,099
it so we didn't have to face trial and

28
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:28,680
possibly going to jail for the rest of

29
00:01:26,099 --> 00:01:32,390
our lives we got our guns and I

30
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,390
ammunition back on our business closed

31
00:01:32,688 --> 00:01:37,949

32
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:43,860
diagnosed with cancer this is my

33
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:45,629
medicine now I take 3 grams a day the

34
00:01:43,859 --> 00:01:47,340
current rules and regulations would

35
00:01:45,629 --> 00:01:50,819
prohibit me from being able to purchase

36
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:53,430
that in a dispensary thank goodness

37
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:55,169
we're good growers and we have great

38
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:58,469
friends that own extraction companies

39
00:01:55,170 --> 00:02:00,000
that can help us out with that the

40
00:01:58,468 --> 00:02:03,688
current rules and regulations that are

41
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,769
being imposed or proposed and i met with

42
00:02:03,688 --> 00:02:09,899
very early today earlier they're going

43
00:02:07,769 --> 00:02:12,969
to hurt the program they're going to

44
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:15,280
damage the program and this program

45
00:02:12,969 --> 00:02:18,580
has been the stepping stone to

46
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,620
legalization in this state I would

47
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:23,170
suggest all of you pick up a Newsweek

48
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:26,439
that just came out and read the story in

49
00:02:23,169 --> 00:02:30,639
it it will explain to you how people

50
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:34,000
come into this state and take advantage

51
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:36,879
of our program with the illegal ways and

52
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:41,979
means and this is what happens to our

53
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:44,079
program we cannot stop fighting we the

54
00:02:41,979 --> 00:02:48,599
honest people that have been part of

55
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:53,740
this program and we work hard number 436

56
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:56,169
436 in this state 17 years ago we cannot

57
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:59,530
stop fighting for this program for the

58
00:02:56,169 --> 00:03:02,889
protection the preservation of it the

59
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:06,340
patients are the building block of

60
00:03:02,889 --> 00:03:09,609
foundation for legalization we deserve

61
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:12,250
better the children deserve better the

62
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:14,680
dying hospice patients deserve to not

63
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:16,509
die before they can access their

64
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:20,890
medicine and dispensaries with their

65
00:03:16,509 --> 00:03:23,409
safety packets safety packets it's crazy

66
00:03:20,889 --> 00:03:25,389
that's all they get for three months

67
00:03:23,409 --> 00:03:28,719
while they're waiting on their actual

68
00:03:25,389 --> 00:03:31,419
credentials to come most of them died a

69
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:34,060
hospice patient has to be deemed 36

70
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:35,799
months or less to be hospice it takes

71
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:39,280
three months to get their actual card

72
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:40,870
from the state you can walk into a DMV

73
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,659
and get your driver's license a

74
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:45,909
temporary and what two weeks later get

75
00:03:43,659 --> 00:03:48,129
it in the mail why is it so cumbersome

76
00:03:45,909 --> 00:03:49,870
just to get your own man p card when we

77

88
00:04:26,829 --> 00:04:34,300
