1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,080
more people that get to use the medicine

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:06,028
the more people will not only be healing

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,378
the physical ailments but the mental

4
00:00:06,028 --> 00:00:09,689
ailments that come from not having

5
00:00:07,378 --> 00:00:11,339
enough in that annoyed activity you just

6
00:00:09,689 --> 00:00:13,109
cause yours just genetically a little

7
00:00:11,339 --> 00:00:14,609
weak on it or you're not eating the

8
00:00:13,109 --> 00:00:17,939
right foods or you're not using cannabis

9
00:00:14,609 --> 00:00:20,100
so what I think is that the more and

10
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,990
more people use it the less they're

11
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,640
going to be able to cling the federal

12
00:00:21,989 --> 00:00:25,469
government is not going to go down easy

13
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,018
and they're going to do everything they

14
00:00:25,469 --> 00:00:30,809
can and every step of the way to

15
00:00:28,018 --> 00:00:32,699
maintain some element of control however

16
00:00:30,809 --> 00:00:35,670
we all know that the truth and reality

17
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:38,340
is on our side so that it will be a

18
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:41,280
progressive weakening of the stupidity

19
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:43,109
that they continuously enforce as we

20
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,239
build the strength of knowledge and

21
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:46,920
truth and I can tell you one of the

22
00:00:45,238 --> 00:00:49,409
robots we're going down now with

23
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,539
cannabis science has to do with HIV and

24
00:00:49,409 --> 00:00:52,889
without going into details we haven't

25
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:54,929
released things I'm not allowed to say

26
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:57,329
things that are not properly press

27
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:59,850
release but in general the reality is

28
00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:02,670
that is somewhere between 35 and 50

29
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:06,599
million people in the world today with

30
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:08,879
HIV and that that number is so dramatic

31
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:11,009
that is going to cause not only the

32
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:13,408
collapse of communities but of countries

33
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:15,540
and potentially the African continent on

34
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:18,150
in terms of economy the United States

35
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:21,210
does not want that to happen you cannot

36
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:23,400
produce enough antiretroviral drugs for

37
00:01:21,209 --> 00:01:25,259
50 million people it's not possible

38
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,689
because of the complexity but we can

39
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:31,109
make cannabis products to satisfy that

40
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:33,478
size of a population need and you have

41
00:01:31,109 --> 00:01:36,328
50 million people learning the truth in

42
00:01:33,478 --> 00:01:38,728
that sense it's it's irrevocable the

43
00:01:36,328 --> 00:01:39,859
government's position will collapse over

44
00:01:38,728 --> 00:01:41,629
time and we're doing

45
00:01:39,859 --> 00:01:43,900
we can to make that happen sooner than

46
00:01:41,629 --> 00:01:43,899
later
