1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,099
it's good to be here in a place where

2
00:00:02,609 --> 00:00:07,648
you know the voters understand the needs

3
00:00:05,099 --> 00:00:09,899
of both the patients and the

4
00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:13,048
recreational people and we all

5
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:15,089
understand that for recreational is this

6
00:00:13,048 --> 00:00:18,448
the most benign therapeutically active

7
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:22,740
substance protecting your neuro in the

8
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:25,410
cannabinoid systems is just to deny us

9
00:00:22,739 --> 00:00:29,098
the access to this wonderful herb is

10
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:32,308
really sacrilegious it is a war against

11
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:36,840
the creator's work work it is a war

12
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:39,659
against the people here I am I have been

13
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:44,460
legal authorized by the federal

14
00:00:39,659 --> 00:00:48,988
government for 27 years I had to prove

15
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:51,530
to FDA DEA and nida that cannabis is the

16
00:00:48,988 --> 00:00:54,419
most efficient the most reliable and the

17
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:57,210
safest part of my treatment as it turns

18
00:00:54,420 --> 00:01:01,590
out today it is the only part of my

19
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:03,660
treatment haha and I am out a niche for

20
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:06,600
most of my friends have a medicine

21
00:01:03,659 --> 00:01:08,789
cabinets full of nasty drugs that cause

22
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:10,679
them to take all their drugs which they

23
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:12,420
have it on their brain deliver their

24
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:15,630
heart and everything else they're trying

25
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:18,359
to protect that marijuana does well gee

26
00:01:15,629 --> 00:01:20,069
is a wonder the pharmaceutical on the

27
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:22,769
health industry just don't want it to

28
00:01:20,069 --> 00:01:25,109
change they will lose fifty percent of

29
00:01:22,769 --> 00:01:27,780
their business at least the day cannabis

30
00:01:25,109 --> 00:01:31,769
takes its rightful place in our society

31
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:34,829
I applaud you for having made so much

32
00:01:31,769 --> 00:01:37,469
progress but you know the jobs far from

33
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:39,839
over I don't know why we're not having

34
00:01:37,469 --> 00:01:43,200
million marches all over this country

35
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,540
behind Bernie Sanders he's the only one

36
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:49,159
has come up with a plan that just might

37
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:52,439
work to end the federal law on us this

38
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:55,290
needs to change we need to get behind

39
00:01:52,438 --> 00:01:58,679
this man it's the only hope i have seen

40
00:01:55,290 --> 00:02:01,500
lately changing laws as long as the pets

41
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:03,570
they know my doctor still doesn't have

42
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:06,060
the right to practice his Hippocratic

43
00:02:03,569 --> 00:02:07,529
oath in other words he's not allowed to

44
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:10,348
have the First Amendment of the

45
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:11,960
Constitution and neither are you not

46
00:02:10,348 --> 00:02:14,379
really we can rent in

47
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:16,879
Raven oh but we can't even light up

48
00:02:14,379 --> 00:02:19,189
after all those approvals I don't feel

49
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:20,719
free to light up right now I don't want

50
00:02:19,189 --> 00:02:23,389
to have so you know how cause your

51
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:26,150
problem this is disgusting this is

52
00:02:23,389 --> 00:02:28,539
ridiculous and to charge someone that

53
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:30,920
wants to start a cannabis business

54
00:02:28,539 --> 00:02:33,799
$5,000 when someone can open a liquor

55
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:39,319
store for 500 there is something really

56
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:41,210
messed up about this we have come a long

57
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:43,489
ways but obviously we're not done with

58
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:45,530
this job we need to change it federally

59
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:49,460
you need to get rid of the clowns who

60
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:51,469
oppose us I thank you jennifer for being

61
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:53,120

00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:03,620

66
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:07,039

67
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:09,680

69
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,180
bureaucracies and that your own

that I had maintained for 37 years when

73
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,710
you got greedy and wanted more money

74
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:27,640
than I could pay you for my license to

75
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:31,189
