1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:05,439
it's not only good for our health and

2
00:00:02,638 --> 00:00:07,519
safety it's good because it creates jobs

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:10,559
and by legalizing hemp

4
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:13,359
in particular we create a whole industry

5
00:00:10,558 --> 00:00:14,718
because hemp is really a gold mine of

6
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:19,039
resources

7
00:00:14,718 --> 00:00:21,278
and as a doctor and as a nutrition um

8
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:23,439
wonk you know i can

9
00:00:21,278 --> 00:00:25,679
testify that there are incredible

10
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:29,198
nutritional

11
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:31,198
values to hemp there are a whole set of

12
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:33,760
fatty acids that are really critical for

13
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:36,160
our health that are not otherwise widely

14
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:38,960
available so there are very important

15
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:41,919
nutritional and food values to hemp as

16
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:44,640
well as potential as fuel

17
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:47,920
its value agriculturally is especially

18
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,960
important in this day and age of climate

19
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,480
change where we have drought we have

20
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,640
heat and all that

21
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:57,599
and where the costs of fossil fuels are

22
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:00,000
skyrocketing fortunately with hemp it's

23
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,000
a really stable crop you don't need uh

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,438
you don't need to irrigate you don't

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,519
need fossil fuel based pesticides and

26
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:10,478
you don't need fossil fuel derived

27
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:13,359
fertilizers either so it's you know it's

28
00:01:10,478 --> 00:01:16,400
a really important crop especially in

29
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:18,319
this day and age of climate change and

30
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,719
likewise it's a really important

31
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:23,199
resource for manufacturing and henry

32
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:26,079
ford in fact you know made entire

33
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:29,759
automobiles out of hemp mercedes-benz

34
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:31,118
still uses hemp as part of the um

35
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,439
i think the panels in their

36
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:36,560
manufacturing process so you know not to

37
00:01:33,438 --> 00:01:39,919
mention its uses in fiber

38
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:42,399
as well so they're just a whole bunch of

39
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,960
manufacturing uses for hemp it can be

40
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:46,000
grown locally it can be grown by small

41
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:48,798
farmers

42
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,118
so this is a valuable resource that that

43
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:55,840
the american people should not be

44
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:55,840
deprived of because of obsolete laws
