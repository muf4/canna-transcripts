1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,099
I am uh here today to talk about

2
00:00:03,178 --> 00:00:06,240
sensible Washington many of you know

3
00:00:05,099 --> 00:00:09,000
that I've been defending medical

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:12,179
marijuana patients for a long time and

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,219
it's my utter frustration at the

6
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:16,560
continuing abuse of medical marijuana

7
00:00:14,218 --> 00:00:19,679
patients and the people that care about

8
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:21,799
them and the voters will and a bunch of

9
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:25,399
other things that has led me to form

10
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,400
with some other people

11
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:31,399
sensiblewashington.org and sensible

12
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:34,799
Washington put an initiative uh out

13
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:36,719
earlier this year we worked very hard to

14
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:39,479
get it on the ballot we had some

15
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,039
problems there was some issues we were

16
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:44,759
not able to get it on the ballot this

17
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:47,519
year we have relaunched at Hempfest we

18
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:50,399
are going to put this on the ballot in

19
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,820
2011 and I think we are going to get it

20
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,820
passed

21
00:00:56,179 --> 00:01:02,759
I have worked with the senator on

22
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:06,780
medical marijuana issues for a number of

23
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:08,819
years and I have nothing but respect for

24
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:10,739
Senator Caldwell she's done some of the

25
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:13,139
finest work on behalf of medical

26
00:01:10,739 --> 00:01:14,158
marijuana patients of any politician in

27
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,280
this state

28
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,280
thank you

29
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:23,400
and she continues to be one of the few

30
00:01:20,938 --> 00:01:26,579
politicians that actually listens to

31
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,080
voter concerns and is in politics for

32
00:01:26,579 --> 00:01:31,400
the right reasons

33
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:31,399
she just is

34
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:39,540
I uh wanted to just briefly address a

35
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:41,340
couple of issues about us about the

36
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:44,400
initiative whatever it will be next year

37
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:47,640
11 whatever I know that the senator has

38
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:49,200
brought up the issue of Regulation and I

39
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,960
know the senator is also talking about

40
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,840
2011 versus 2012 and I want to tell you

41
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:56,459
why regulation is not part of the

42
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,079
initiative and won't be part of the

43
00:01:56,459 --> 00:02:00,078
initiative

44
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:03,239
the um

45
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:06,478
the issue of putting regulation in an

46
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:08,060
initiative is a complex one and you

47
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:11,639
cannot get

48
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:15,539
regulation into an initiative without

49
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:18,479
risking Federal preemption the way I

50
00:02:15,539 --> 00:02:21,179
have approached uh ending marijuana

51
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:24,598
prohibition is not unique and it's not

52
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:26,280
particularly new in fact I went back and

53
00:02:24,598 --> 00:02:29,039
I researched how we got rid of

54
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:30,959
prohibition I was a history major in

55
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:33,780
college and I went back and I started

56
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:36,180
digging and what I found out was that

57
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:38,818
prohibition was largely repealed by

58
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:40,500
citizens and it was repealed by citizens

59
00:02:38,818 --> 00:02:42,179
initiatives and it was repealed by

60
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:44,400
citizens committees that proposed

61
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:47,340
legislation because politicians didn't

62
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:50,219
want to do it in New York it was

63
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:52,039
repealed legislatively about 10 years

64
00:02:50,219 --> 00:02:54,840
before the rest of the country

65
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:56,639
this whole approach it gave me a

66
00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:00,479
template it gave me a way to look at

67
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:02,639
getting marijuana prohibition ended and

68
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:04,979
it gave me a way of looking at the

69
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:06,899
framework legally that would allow us to

70
00:03:04,979 --> 00:03:09,959
do it and have it be what I call real

71
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:12,060
reform and not you know policy driven

72
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:14,280
reform that can change from

73
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:16,319
Administration to Administration we

74
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,239
don't want that and I would never ask

75
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:20,759
anybody to waste their time and their

76
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,920
precious labor and risk their life to go

77
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:26,399
out and work on something that wasn't

78
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:28,619
going to stick so the way our initiative

79
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,840
is set up it's identical to the way

80
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:34,200
initiatives were set up that removed

81
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:37,860
prohibition all it does is an issue of

82
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:41,818
state law it removes all civil and

83
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:44,340
criminal penalties for adult use of

84
00:03:41,818 --> 00:03:47,298
marijuana in any way agriculturally

85
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:49,799
medically recreationally

86
00:03:47,299 --> 00:03:52,200
construction I don't you know whatever

87
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:53,939
it is it just removes all the criminal

88
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:56,818
and civil penalties

89
00:03:53,939 --> 00:03:58,979
it does not regulate it doesn't do

90
00:03:56,818 --> 00:04:01,919
anything else it simply removes those

91
00:03:58,979 --> 00:04:03,238
penalties that is what you have to do if

92
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:05,518
you want to get rid of marijuana

93
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:08,400
prohibition first you remove the

94
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:11,219
penalties then the legislature can go in

95
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,500
and regulate and when the federal

96
00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:16,199
government comes to say we don't like

97
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:18,899
your regulations because they're in a

98
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:21,720
law passed by A legislature the

99
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:23,959
Constitutional Doctrine constitutional

100
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:27,180
Doctrine called commandeering Doctrine

101
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:30,299
allows the state to defend its

102
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:32,220
regulations in court and and overcome

103
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:34,800
preemption

104
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:36,600
this is the best hope we have of ending

105
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,040
marijuana prohibition and it is the

106
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,919
template that the rest of the states

107
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:44,220
need to use to get rid of this

108
00:04:40,918 --> 00:04:46,319
it is defensible against the federal

109
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:48,419
government in a way that nothing else is

110
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:50,819
if you pass the regulations in an

111
00:04:48,418 --> 00:04:53,399
initiative they can be struck down and

112
00:04:50,819 --> 00:04:55,560
so can the subsequent law it's a little

113
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:57,719
bit of legal Theory it's a little bit of

114
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,639
constitutional law but unfortunately

115
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:02,400
we've got to grasp it and understand it

116
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:04,620
if we want to achieve real reform and

117
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:07,399
get rid of these unjust goddamn

118
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:07,399
marijuana laws

119
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,259
thank you

120
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:18,779
the real issues surrounding marijuana as

121
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:20,939
well are issues related to Industrial

122
00:05:18,779 --> 00:05:22,799
Hemp it's critically important for

123
00:05:20,939 --> 00:05:24,779
people in the medical marijuana movement

124
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,360
and in the recreational marijuana

125
00:05:24,779 --> 00:05:30,239
movement to realize that we have a whole

126
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:33,479
bunch of allies with Industrial Hemp

127
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:35,939
Industrial Hemp is the economic giant

128
00:05:33,478 --> 00:05:38,279
that we are talking about here we are

129
00:05:35,939 --> 00:05:40,279
currently for every hemp of product that

130
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:43,138
you are buying in the United States

131
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:44,879
every single one of those have products

132
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:48,379
whether it's food whether it's the new

133
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:53,060
hemp Creed whether it's

134
00:05:48,379 --> 00:05:56,279
clothing or paper or lotions or whatever

135
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:59,038
anything that you buy that is made out

136
00:05:56,279 --> 00:06:01,019
of hemp the hemp has to be imported it

137
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:03,360
is imported from China it is imported

138
00:06:01,019 --> 00:06:06,139
from Eastern Europe it is imported from

139
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:09,538
Canada those are the three countries

140
00:06:06,139 --> 00:06:11,879
ridiculous why are we penalizing the

141
00:06:09,538 --> 00:06:14,339
best farmers in the world people in this

142
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:16,680
state that can grow fields of marijuana

143
00:06:14,339 --> 00:06:18,719
in Eastern Washington why are we

144
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:20,759
penalizing our farmers and supporting

145
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,139
foreign economies

146
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:25,160
thank you

147
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:29,280
how in the does that make any sense

148
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:31,639
any sense at all any sense none there is

149
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:34,439
none there we're talking about

150
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:37,340
regulation as well I'm not overly

151
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:41,160
concerned about cannabis regulation

152
00:06:37,339 --> 00:06:43,859
Mason vert and safer have done a lot of

153
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:45,900
work Brian's Pals comrades and arms and

154
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:47,639
mine too they've done a lot of work to

155
00:06:45,899 --> 00:06:50,219
show people marijuana is one of the

156
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:52,800
safest things on the planet there's no

157
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:54,560
Lethal lethal dose the plants aren't

158
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,418
going to get together and attack us

159
00:06:54,560 --> 00:07:00,300
there is nothing's there is nothing

160
00:06:57,418 --> 00:07:04,159
dangerous about marijuana it should be

161
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:08,038
an over-the-counter uh openly sold

162
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:10,560
remedy there is nothing dangerous about

163
00:07:08,038 --> 00:07:12,478
it at all the only thing dangerous about

164
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,978
it is the power it has to make people

165
00:07:12,478 --> 00:07:16,079
act crazy

166
00:07:13,978 --> 00:07:17,879
and do stupid things like lock other

167
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:21,180
people up

168
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:23,459
but at any rate the industrial hemp

169
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:26,098
issue and the medical issue and the

170
00:07:23,459 --> 00:07:28,859
recreational issue are all covered by

171
00:07:26,098 --> 00:07:33,598
the initiative we need to get this

172
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:35,759
initiative past 2011 or 2012.

173
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:38,519
I really don't care

174
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:40,800
the people that are working with me and

175
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:43,318
the commitment that they have is what is

176
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,060
driving me and is driving the

177
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:47,220
organization it's a Grassroots

178
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:48,899
organization people like Don skakier

179
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:50,639
sitting here people like Amazon Johnson

180
00:07:48,899 --> 00:07:52,500
is sitting here that have been working

181
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,418
and pouring their lifeblood into this

182
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:56,819
thing and they basically told me look

183
00:07:54,418 --> 00:08:00,899
if you don't run it we're

184
00:07:56,819 --> 00:08:03,840
running it so I said okay let's go again

185
00:08:00,899 --> 00:08:06,000
so we are running again next year we're

186
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:08,418
going to run every year until we get

187
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,418
this done

188
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:18,959

189
00:08:16,379 --> 00:08:21,120
or 2012 there are pollsters that have

190
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:23,279
talked to me that are telling me 2011's

191
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,720
better because we'll actually drive the

192
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:26,219
turnout and people will actually come

193
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,259
out to vote for us when they don't come

194
