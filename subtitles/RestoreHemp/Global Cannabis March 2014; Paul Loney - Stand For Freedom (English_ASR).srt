1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,639
as a consumer you have the right to know

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:09,119
how your medicine has grown what's in

3
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:11,160
your medicine so you need a folks asset

4
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:13,320
you know as you if you don't grow your

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:15,359
own medicine ask your grower what's in

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,399
it you know as a consumer you have the

7
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:20,039
right to know it's your medicine so

8
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:22,320
stand up for it and ask what's going on

9
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:24,779
with my medicine

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,359
so yeah and the folks and also normal

11
00:00:24,778 --> 00:00:29,820
we're out there lobbying to improve our

12
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,279
laws you know because you know right now

13
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,780
the dispensaries are starting to be

14
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:35,820
rolled out which is great

15
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:40,500
congratulations to everybody who got

16
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:43,439
their license all right so but you know

17
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:45,738
folks we need to have it so that if a

18
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:48,179
school moves in next dispensary

19
00:00:45,738 --> 00:00:50,038
dispensary has to close that's not fair

20
00:00:48,179 --> 00:00:52,259
is it

21
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:55,260
that's right it's not fair if you're

22
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:57,000
there paying your taxes paying your

23
00:00:55,259 --> 00:00:59,399
employees doing everything they're

24
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,340
supposed to do and then the school moves

25
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:04,079
in you have to close that's that's not

26
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:06,719
American folks and one of my clients

27
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:09,599
told me you know that sounds more like

28
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:12,719
Russia so again that part has to be

29
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:15,359
fixed talk to your legislators you know

30
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:17,219
as Scott said we're voting in November

31
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:19,560
and all these legendaries they're not

32
00:01:17,219 --> 00:01:22,679
coming around asking for your vote and

33
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,659
staying here and ask them you know what

34
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,280
are you going to do to improve my access

35
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:28,920
to Medicine

36
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:31,079
how are you gonna fix this law you know

37
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,519
are you going to stop these moratoriums

38
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:34,319
because again because they're going to

39
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:36,599
be back next year folks asking for

40
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:39,959
another moratorium we can't let that

41
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:42,359
happen you know tell them it's time to

42
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:44,879
stop being scared it's time to come up

43
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:46,978
with the reasonable regulations we all

44
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:49,500
support that everybody here supports

45
00:01:46,978 --> 00:01:51,959
reusable regulations that's all we're

46
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:54,899
asking for you know and the other one is

47
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:57,419
why do we have a dispensaries have to be

48
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:58,859
a thousand feet from another one you

49
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:01,019
know bars could be next to each other

50
00:01:58,859 --> 00:02:02,700
you know that's not that you know why

51
00:02:01,019 --> 00:02:04,859
dispensaries have to be a thousand feet

52
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:07,259
from each other you know that's just

53
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:09,419
artificially increases the price of

54
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:11,939
medicine you know and once again that's

55
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:15,359
not America folks that's Russia you know

56
00:02:11,939 --> 00:02:17,400
we're here in America so uh again talk

57
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,379
to your state legislatures this is not

58
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:22,379
fair you know why are they doing this to

59
00:02:19,378 --> 00:02:26,039
us you know we need to make sure that

60
00:02:22,378 --> 00:02:27,840
free competition can take place you know

61
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:30,060
and there are Growers can be protected

62
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,580
as they grow medicine okay they don't

63
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:35,098
have to worry about artificial weight

64
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:38,640
limits talk to your state legislatures

65
00:02:35,098 --> 00:02:40,560
about that you know educate them most of

66
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:43,199
the state legislatures aren't very

67
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,019
educated and you heard Congressman Earl

68
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:48,359
blumeier talk about him

69
00:02:45,019 --> 00:02:50,219
he got educated now it's time we have to

70
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,200
educate the rest of them we can't leave

71
00:02:50,219 --> 00:02:54,539
it up to counter women always educate

72
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:56,639
folks we have to do it that's our

73
00:02:54,539 --> 00:02:59,340
responsibility is to get out there and

74
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:01,738
educator like Anna's doing it with

75
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:03,840
patience for pot that's great normal

76
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:06,719
woman's lines that's great you know

77
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,500
there's Ico out there making videos of

78
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:08,759
this

79
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,098
you know

80
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:13,259
all right and so

81
00:03:11,098 --> 00:03:15,839
um you know and part of my other life as

82
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:17,639
I you know represent processors and

83
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,400
Growers and producers and dispensaries

84
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:23,639
but also represent folks who get into

85
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:27,140
trouble out there and so I always like

86
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:30,059
to wrap up my little uh talk

87
00:03:27,139 --> 00:03:31,979
here we could stop by the police or they

88
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:34,860
were approaching what you have to say

89
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:37,079
folks so remember

90
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:39,360
you know don't say nothing he's right

91
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:41,700
don't say anything but there's four

92
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,400
little sayings that you always have to

93
00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:46,919
think of and I'll say them and repeat

94
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,620
after me and Michael knows these I know

95
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:52,199
that Russ knows them let's use them

96
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:57,080
quite well the other day so

97
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:57,079
the first one is am I free to go officer

98
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:01,759
I do not consent to any searches

99
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,319
I wish to speak to my attorney

100
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:14,539
and I wish to remain silent yeah

101
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,540
all right thanks folks

102
00:04:15,019 --> 00:04:22,019
thank you so much Paul Looney

103
00:04:18,978 --> 00:04:25,079
the real message right there folks is is

104
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:27,740
we don't have to be bullied by the

105
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:30,478
police when you're pulled over

106
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:33,060
especially if you know your rights and

107
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:35,099
how to handle the situation

108
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:37,860
sounds real easy

109
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:40,919
if we read up on it study up on it put

110
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:43,400
ourselves in those situations we can be

111
00:04:40,918 --> 00:04:43,399
protected
