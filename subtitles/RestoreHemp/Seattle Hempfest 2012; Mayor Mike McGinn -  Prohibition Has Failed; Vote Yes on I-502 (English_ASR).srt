1
00:00:10,919 --> 00:00:15,879
so when I was running for office I was

2
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:18,839
asked what my position was on the

3
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:21,439
legalization of marijuana and what I

4
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:24,118
said was that if every elected official

5
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:27,118
whoever smoked marijuana voted to

6
00:00:24,118 --> 00:00:28,960
legalize it it would be legal in an

7
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:30,559
instant

8
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,359
so

9
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:35,799
it's the truth it's the truth here's

10
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:41,000
what we know

11
00:00:35,799 --> 00:00:42,159
prohibition has not worked it's fueled

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,079
criminal

13
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:48,000
violence right now in this city right

14
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:50,920
now in this city I know this I know this

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,600
right now in this city we have seen

16
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:57,439
murders because people are murdering

17
00:00:53,600 --> 00:01:00,198
each other over pot we have seen home

18
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:03,000
invasion robberies because it's it's a

19
00:01:00,198 --> 00:01:06,319
black market substance I have a member

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,719
of my staff I have a member of my staff

21
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:13,719
and like a lot of people he he Brews his

22
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:15,640
own beer in his house he doesn't have to

23
00:01:13,719 --> 00:01:18,798
worry about somebody breaking into his

24
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:20,239
house to steal his beer he doesn't have

25
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:23,520
to worry that when he gives it to a

26
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:25,798
friend he's subjecting himself to arrest

27
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:28,519
and the rules we have right now on

28
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:31,960
marijuana they put too many young people

29
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:34,199
at risk not just of arrest not just of

30
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:36,879
incarceration and by the way which Falls

31
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,719
much more heavily much more heavily on

32
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:42,879
our communities of color than it does on

33
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:46,478
everyone else but it also fuels criminal

34
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:51,359
violence and it makes us all less safe

35
00:01:46,478 --> 00:01:56,879
it's time to stop it's time to tax it

36
00:01:51,359 --> 00:02:00,959
regulate it Legalize It vote Yes on
