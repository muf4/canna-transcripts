1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,769
I started working with the Grateful Dead

2
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:06,839
in 1988 I was running the rock medicine

3
00:00:04,769 --> 00:00:10,768
team I was buck stopper for the downtown

4
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:12,570
and when Jerry died in 1995 that same

5
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:15,240
month we were having a hip rally up here

6
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:17,368
in Seattle and I retired from running

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,960
the rock medicine team and decided that

8
00:00:17,368 --> 00:00:22,259
I needed to go to the hip rally I've

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,600
been playing hip rally since 1991 and I

10
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:27,000
came up here I played on main stage and

11
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,320
when I was done with that I helped just

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,089
do rock medicine take care of a crowd

13
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,668
issues and you know things that come up

14
00:00:30,089 --> 00:00:34,049
in the crowd what we discovered was in a

15
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:35,699
hip rally they're not too many things to

16
00:00:34,049 --> 00:00:38,009
come up in a ground a lot less than they

17
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:41,399
did at the Dead shows so it's been a

18
00:00:38,009 --> 00:00:46,709
long journey that was 1995 and here it

19
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:48,480
is 2015 and I'm still here I represent

20
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:50,549
seattle hempfest as the grand prize

21
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:54,209
committee now I've been opening act for

22
00:00:50,549 --> 00:00:57,479
19 years and we we just have a whole

23
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:59,460
bunch of things that we do to try to

24
00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:02,159
raise money for the cause now so it's

25
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:04,290
it's kind of turned from a gut-wrenching

26
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:06,118
everybody's going to jail to now a

27
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:08,130
celebration and everybody's here and

28
00:01:06,118 --> 00:01:09,688
they're all making money and and you

29
00:01:08,129 --> 00:01:12,719
know it's it's a different world now

30
00:01:09,688 --> 00:01:15,149
than when we started and as you know so

31
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:18,450
I'm just glad to be a part of it still I

32
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:21,270
am really grateful to be here well you

33
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:22,650
bring up a really good common point when

34
00:01:21,269 --> 00:01:25,259
people say well why do you still need to

35
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:27,780
do that didn't you win yeah we went here

36
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:29,400
in Washington a little bit and we want a

37
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:31,079
little bit in Oregon we want a little

38
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,670
bit in California we've owned a little

39
00:01:31,078 --> 00:01:34,739
bit in some states but quite frankly

40
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:37,109
there's still people getting cops

41
00:01:34,739 --> 00:01:38,640
pulling them over every day there's

42
00:01:37,109 --> 00:01:40,349
still people who are getting arrested

43
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,659
every day there's still people getting

44
00:01:40,349 --> 00:01:44,280
getting in you know put in jail there's

45
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:46,560
still people being fine going to prison

46
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,180
losing their kids getting their dog shot

47
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,478
in their front yard there's still people

48
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:52,890
as long as that is going on we'll be

49
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:54,289
here you just want to make sure your

50
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:56,870
voice is being heard and

51
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:58,220
and I'm if you if you really believe in

52
00:01:56,870 --> 00:02:00,020
what you're doing you got to stand out

53
00:01:58,219 --> 00:02:01,879
and you've got to speak the truth so

54
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:03,619
that's all I barely ever tried to do is

55
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:06,289
stand up and speak the truth either in

56
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:08,450
my in my written word in my voke award

57
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:11,090
and my singing word it's just stand up

58
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:13,780
and speak the truth and it speaks the

59
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:16,219
truth to power you'll never lose out

60
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:19,490
speak the truth to power so that's what

61
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:21,139
we've tried to do here as as a conscious

62
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:24,520
effort throughout all the years that

63
00:02:21,139 --> 00:02:24,519
we've been here at their manifest
