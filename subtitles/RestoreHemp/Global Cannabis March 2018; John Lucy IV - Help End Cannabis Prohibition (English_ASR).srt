00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:36,539
older and a medical patient can walk

66
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:38,639
into a store and buy this this was given

67
00:02:36,539 --> 00:02:40,620
to me today by someone who has the right

68
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:42,569
to make it because Oregon has homegrown

69
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:45,090
we have the right to grow your own

70
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:47,009
medicine or recreation as you see fit

71
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:49,650
and we fought really hard for that

72
00:02:47,009 --> 00:02:52,019
privilege not every state has that every

73
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:55,110
state will have that that will happen

74
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:57,330
that day will come back because that day

75
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:59,670
was not that long ago we will end

76
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:02,489
marijuana prohibition entirely in this

77
00:02:59,669 --> 00:03:05,399

a time one prisoner at a time I want you

79
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,450
to understand though I want you everyone

80
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:11,669
in here to think for a moment this

81
00:03:09,449 --> 00:03:14,459
gentleman spent five plus years in

82
00:03:11,669 --> 00:03:16,708
prison okay what I want right now from

83
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:19,709
everyone here is something really simple

84
00:03:16,709 --> 00:03:22,560
and it's silence I want everyone here to

85
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:24,360
take 30 seconds and I want you to think

86
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,310
about what it would be like to spend the

87
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:28,260
next five years of your life in prison

88
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:31,079
for the amount of marijuana that I'm

89
00:03:28,259 --> 00:03:33,328
holding in my hand okay I'm gonna time

90
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:35,700
it I'm gonna shut up it's really rare

91
00:03:33,329 --> 00:03:38,510
that I shut up so starting now thirty

92
00:03:35,699 --> 00:03:38,509
seconds of silence

93
00:04:05,709 --> 00:04:10,289
you just did 30 seconds the man who just

94
00:04:08,709 --> 00:04:13,030
walked off the stage did five years

95
00:04:10,289 --> 00:04:15,218
Bernard Noble did seven years four

96
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:17,620
months and a couple days and he still

97
00:04:15,218 --> 00:04:19,509
he's on parole he's still getting drug

98
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:21,189
tested every month he's still in the

99
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:22,900
position that if he screws up in the

100
00:04:21,189 --> 00:04:25,389
slightest if he so much as runs a red

101
00:04:22,899 --> 00:04:27,579
light that man's back in prison over two

102
00:04:25,389 --> 00:04:29,560
grams of marijuana so I want everyone

103
00:04:27,579 --> 00:04:31,359
here today to think about what it would

104
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:33,850
be like to spend that amount of time in

105
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,379
a metal cage over a plant because that's

106
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:37,780
what we're still dealing with in America

107
00:04:35,379 --> 00:04:39,339
every single one of you here today has

108
00:04:37,779 --> 00:04:40,869
the right to walk around as long as

109
00:04:39,339 --> 00:04:42,459
you're an adult with an ounce of

110
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:44,199
marijuana in your pocket and no one gets

111
00:04:42,459 --> 00:04:45,728
to say much else to you and that's a

112
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:48,250
wonderful privilege that we live in such

113
00:04:45,728 --> 00:04:50,019
a place but it's not finished just

114
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:51,699
because it's done here doesn't mean it's

115
00:04:50,019 --> 00:04:53,379
done everywhere else I don't know if you

116
00:04:51,699 --> 00:04:55,060
noticed or not but my accent ain't from

117
00:04:53,379 --> 00:04:57,939
here I'm originally from North Carolina

118
00:04:55,060 --> 00:05:00,579
my family members died in prison okay I

119
00:04:57,939 --> 00:05:02,469
had friends and family who in cages they

120
00:05:00,579 --> 00:05:04,060
went there for years and years and years

121
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:06,310
for an amount of marijuana that honestly

122
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:08,079
people in stores here throw on a counter

123
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:10,060
and can sell to you I want you to

124
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:12,848
understand that we have it really really

125
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:14,680
good we have it amazing in Oregon we

126
00:05:12,848 --> 00:05:15,908
have a system here that rivals any in

127
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:18,400
the US are we going to make it better

128
00:05:15,908 --> 00:05:20,110
yes there are problems with it everyone

129
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:22,299
here knows if you're involved in this

130
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:23,949
fight that it's not perfect but I would

131
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,780
I want you to understand is that when

132
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:27,310
people come here from Mississippi when

133
00:05:25,779 --> 00:05:28,959
they come here from Louisiana when they

134
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:30,579
come here from Idaho when they come here

135
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:32,408
from the south when they come here from

136
00:05:30,579 --> 00:05:34,870
other countries where marijuana is the

137
00:05:32,408 --> 00:05:37,120
death penalty they come to a place that

138
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:39,370
allows them freedom that allows the

139
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,959
compassion and allows us to live in a

140
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:43,180
better world because we get to share

141
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:48,489

144
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:54,939

145
00:05:53,529 --> 00:05:56,888
