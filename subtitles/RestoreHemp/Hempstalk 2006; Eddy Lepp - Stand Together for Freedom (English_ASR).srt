1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:08,519
I tell a little story I've told it a lot

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:10,400
and uh I'll tell you guys it real quick

3
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:12,919
and perhaps you'll understand then why I

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,798
do what I

5
00:00:12,919 --> 00:00:18,640
do many years ago I went to this little

6
00:00:15,798 --> 00:00:22,399
[ __ ] hole in Southeast Asia called

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:25,640
Vietnam and it uh screwed up my head

8
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:28,479
real bad so for about 15 years I didn't

9
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:32,359
really give a [ __ ] about my wife or my

10
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,480
kids or my or anything else and then one

11
00:00:32,359 --> 00:00:35,799
day I had a

12
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:39,558
realization that if I didn't change my

13
00:00:35,799 --> 00:00:42,399
life I was going to die and so about 17

14
00:00:39,558 --> 00:00:44,799
or 18 years ago now I got sober but I

15
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:47,480
would devote the rest of my life to

16
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:51,399
promoting the sacred plant at every

17
00:00:47,479 --> 00:00:54,000
level both as a medicinal and as a

18
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:57,000
industrial product and that I would

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,159
dedicate myself to helping those less

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,119
fortunate my wife and I started a

21
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:07,840
Ministry and 2000 in 2002 we were rid

22
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:10,840
where they got 658 kilos I believe

23
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,680
nobody was arrested we figured we were

24
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,759
safe the next year we planted over a

25
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:17,118
th000

26
00:01:13,759 --> 00:01:19,200
plants which we harvested safely and the

27
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:20,719
following year they came in and raided

28
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,439
us and then the following spring they

29
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:25,438
came and raided us again the reason I

30
00:01:23,438 --> 00:01:28,199
tell you this background is

31
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:30,478
because I've based my entire defense I'm

32
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:34,200
facing four life sentences

33
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:36,280
$17 million in fines an additional 40

34
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:40,560
years and the part that really makes my

35
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:40,560
balls ache a $600 spatial

36
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:46,640
assessment they get to 17 [ __ ]

37
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,320
million they can wait on his

38
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,159
600

39
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:52,718
anyway uh we have based our entire

40
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:55,399
defense on the religious freedoms

41
00:01:52,718 --> 00:01:57,399
restoration act which allows for the use

42
00:01:55,399 --> 00:01:59,478
of marijuana as a holy

43
00:01:57,399 --> 00:02:02,079
sacrament and for 2 years I've been

44
00:01:59,478 --> 00:02:04,879
trying to get this in front of a judge

45
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:07,438
and the federal government the judge

46
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:09,318
even my own attorneys have all conspired

47
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:11,439
against me at every level to keep this

48
00:02:09,318 --> 00:02:14,000
argument from going in front of a a

49
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:16,840
court there was a recent decision by the

50
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,680
Supreme Court called the udv decision

51
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:21,360
which is incredibly critical because it

52
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,200
has to do with the church drinking what

53
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,200
they call wausa tea which comparing

54
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:28,318
marijuana to that tea is like comparing

55
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:31,359
ice water to battery

56
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:34,199
acid the Supreme Court said in the 90

57
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,920
vote leave them boys alone now if they

58
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:39,878
can let people French Kiss rattlesnakes

59
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:42,839
drink cyanide drink a tea that they

60
00:02:39,878 --> 00:02:44,598
Import in 50 gallon drums from Brazil

61
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,400
then I am having a lot of trouble

62
00:02:44,598 --> 00:02:49,158
wondering why they are so hesitant to

63
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,920
put a marijuana case in front of the

64
00:02:49,158 --> 00:02:55,318
judge they they tell me it's because I

65
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:58,958
would be what they refer to as a Gateway

66
00:02:55,318 --> 00:03:01,439
case which means that if I won and you

67
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:03,158
guys all joins my church we'd all be

68
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:05,479
sitting here smoking pot right now

69
00:03:03,158 --> 00:03:07,798
instead about wondering about looking

70
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:09,639
over your shoulder you'd be able to do

71
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:13,799
whatever you wanted they couldn't stop

72
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:15,039
it and that's why my case is on hold now

73
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:16,719
it looks like they're going to probably

74
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:18,318
dismiss all of my charges but they're

75
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:20,080
going to do it under bad warrants so

76
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:22,119
they don't ever have to address the

77
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,159
religious

78
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,920
issue for those of you that are

79
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:27,239
disappointed this is where the story

80
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:30,438
gets

81
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:32,959
interesting my wife who was as bald as a

82
00:03:30,438 --> 00:03:34,438
baby [ __ ] bird and weighs less than

83
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,360
100 lb I think we're going to be there

84
00:03:34,438 --> 00:03:39,039
in like a month or four months ago told

85
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:43,360
me that she had to do something before

86
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:45,000
she died to make things right oh yeah so

87
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,040
she went down and she started her own

88
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,840
Ministry because I couldn't do it

89
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:51,318
through the one that we had started

90
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,438
together because of the legal problems I

91
00:03:51,318 --> 00:03:55,199
already

92
00:03:52,438 --> 00:03:56,719
had she turned around at that time

93
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:58,759
ensued the Attorney General of the

94
00:03:56,719 --> 00:04:00,479
United States the Attorney General of

95
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:03,039
the State of California the governor of

96
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:04,438
the state of California all of the de

97
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:06,199
agents and the National Guard the

98
00:04:04,438 --> 00:04:08,120
highway patrol and Sheriff agents

99
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:12,078
involved in her [ __ ]

100
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:14,200
raids right now she has I'm not sure but

101
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:17,160
somewhere in the neighborhood at 35,000

102
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:20,279
plants planted back in our garden and so

103
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:22,759
far they have come in and done

104
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:24,918
nothing I cannot tell you what an honor

105
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:27,560
it is to have Jack career for a best

106
00:04:24,918 --> 00:04:30,719
friend but that peels by comparison the

107
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:33,439
honor I have of having lenda for a

108
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,080
wife she personally is taking this to

109
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:37,120
them in such a way they will have to

110
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:39,959
address the religious consequences of

111
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,560
this and once it's settled it will be

112
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:44,279
legal across the

113
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:46,560
board I Know Jack sometimes has a little

114
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:49,478
trouble getting the message out because

115
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:52,439
of his stroke but in a nutshell what he

116
00:04:49,478 --> 00:04:54,560
said was hemp will save the world if you

117
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:56,560
will study the history of hemp and

118
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,600
marijuana you will find that it is the

119
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:02,240
Mainstay product that has sustained this

120
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:05,199
world for over 25,000 years that we can

121
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:07,519
prove in black and white I said this

122
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:11,080
last month in Seattle at the Hempfest

123
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:14,279
and I say it to you now I promise you if

124
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:16,959
we will all stand up just one [ __ ]

125
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:18,919
time together we will never have to

126
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:20,120
stand up

127
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:22,199
[Applause]

128
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:26,560
again

129
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:29,720
70% 70% of the

130
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:32,240
Republicans in a national survey in

131
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:35,880
admitted that they smoked pot and had no

132
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,879
problem with marijuana as a

133
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,879
medicine that's 70% of the people that

134
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:41,879

138
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,720
they are our servants and that means

139
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:58,639
that they kneel at our feet not rip out

140
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:01,479
our throat and bite our hands we pay

141

144
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:12,560
read that if it's a victimless crime

145
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:14,319
there can be no jail time how many of

146

most of the

151
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:25,519
crowd read the

152
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:27,399
Constitution the other thing Jack said

153
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:30,279
that's imperative is you have to know

154
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:32,159
your rights you have to to understand

155
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:34,198
the laws and you have to understand your

156
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,759
rights under the

157
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:43,478
laws and the best thing that we can do

158
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:46,080
is vote the NAACP the NRA the multitude

159
00:06:43,478 --> 00:06:51,519
of national organizations that create

160
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:51,519
voting blocks control elections
