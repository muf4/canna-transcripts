3
00:00:07,139 --> 00:00:13,919
love in a most unique manner

4
00:00:10,919 --> 00:00:16,500
a Salvation I am here to thank you from

5
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:18,839
the bottom of my heart on behalf of

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,600
hundreds of thousands of patients here

7
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:24,480
in your state of Washington and hundreds

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:28,500
of millions around the world all of whom

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:31,320
want their voices heard all of them are

10
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:34,019
giving thanks to the Creator for a

11
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:36,899
wonderful gift that alleviates their

12
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:40,140
symptoms to many illnesses and it is

13
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:40,140
called cannabis

14
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:47,219
we called it marijuana and tried to

15
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:49,920
demonize it by changing its name but the

16
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:52,800
miracle kept proclaiming itself and

17
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,859
today everything I wear from my toes to

18
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:59,459
my head is made from that beautiful

19
00:00:55,859 --> 00:01:02,840
plant that God gave us and said here

20
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,840
take care of your planet

21
00:01:05,579 --> 00:01:12,179
we are so fortunate to have so many of

22
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:14,400
you who have taken a stand for either

23
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:16,320
the environment the destruction to the

24
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,700
ocean that's being provided by this

25
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:20,099
prohibition

26
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:22,020
whether you're a constitutionalist and

27
00:01:20,099 --> 00:01:24,658
know that the supreme law of the land

28
00:01:22,019 --> 00:01:27,719
cannot be trashed in this fashion while

29
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:30,240
we stand by and do nothing

30
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:32,459
we are human beings with a heart and a

31
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:36,060
soul and a spirit that unites with those

32
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:40,559
Behind Bars who have committed no crime

33
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:42,359
they simply found a wiser bud

34
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,478
no

35
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:47,700
and so it is really really a privilege

36
00:01:45,478 --> 00:01:50,519
to say to you thank you for having

37
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:52,680
changed this loss here in the state of

38
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:54,599
Washington

39
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:57,420
that is not only because you have

40
00:01:54,599 --> 00:02:00,419
patience here but because you are aiding

41
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:03,719
that lighter day to come shining through

42
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:07,259
the rest of the world The Dark Knight of

43
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:10,978
ignorance is over and people like you

44
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:14,000
have brought in the new day as we Face

45
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:14,000
the new millennium

46
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,780
your legislators can no longer hide from

47
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:20,219
you

48
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:22,500
hey

49
00:02:20,219 --> 00:02:24,900
we can have this this will be political

50
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:27,000
suicide another election is coming and

51
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:28,860
you're gonna get answers from them and

52
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,860
you're gonna kick the one side of office

53
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:33,840
who denied the voters power and the

54
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:36,120
voters rights

55
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:39,840
but there is someone with me who is a

56
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:43,140
hero in our area he's been an advocate

57
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:45,900
for many many issues and especially for

58
00:02:43,139 --> 00:02:47,878
medical marijuana and lo and behead he

59
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:50,159
became a patient eventually as well he

60
00:02:47,878 --> 00:02:53,340
just went through about with horrible

61
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:55,500
cancer and I he can tell you his story I

62
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:57,959
won't be singing to you today because I

63
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:59,818
want Norman to speak to you and I want

64
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:02,098
you to stop by the Green Cross and pick

65
00:02:59,818 --> 00:03:04,259
up a copy of this tape called the war on

66
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:06,299

thank you I'm Norm can't tell me his

70
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,800
attorney I had the opportunity to speak

00:03:11,878 --> 00:03:16,500
earlier and they'll be asked me to

72
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:19,019
address you again

73
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,680
at the end of my talk I simply asked

74
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:21,780
that

75
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,959
what matters most is that all of us

76
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:27,120
individually collectively as a group as

77
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:31,800
a community and we truly are a community

78
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:34,080
here today stand up and be counted that

79
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:36,599
we create the world we live in by each

80
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,280
and every choice we make every day and

81
00:03:36,598 --> 00:03:40,738
to have the courage to come out of the

82
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:43,439
closet and speak up and say cannabis

83
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:45,658
prohibition is wrong is the beginning to

84
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:48,840
the end of that prohibition

85
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:50,878
whatever you musika did 12 years ago

86
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:54,239
this week in a Fort Lauderdale courtroom

87
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:56,518
would say no to Injustice to to stand up

88
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,920
to prosecutors that wanted to put her in

89
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:00,480
jail to stand up to the judge in the

90
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:03,359
criminal justice system that

91
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:05,699
criminalized marijuana she said no I

92
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,220
will not take a plea I demand the right

93
00:04:05,699 --> 00:04:11,219
to go to a jury trial I want the right

94
00:04:08,219 --> 00:04:13,620
to Advocate before a court of law and a

95
00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:16,259
community of my citizens that using

96
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:18,840
marijuana medicinally is in fact not a

97
00:04:16,259 --> 00:04:21,779
criminal act but a just that a righteous

98
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:24,299
act a moral act and she took that stand

99
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:26,819
she was willing to go to prison to fight

100
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:31,520
for it and the jury and the judge

101
00:04:26,819 --> 00:04:31,519
acquitted her and found her not guilty

102
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:38,040
and what really

103
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:41,220
what really are that day is that the

104
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:43,680
criminal justice system was saying that

105
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:46,139
the laws are guilty and that we are

106
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,360
innocent that the laws are unjust and

107
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:50,759
criminal and yet we are the not guilty

108
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,680
ones and it is Criminal to lock people

109
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:55,020
up and put them in jail for the simple

110
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:57,418
possession of marijuana and his unjust

111
00:04:55,019 --> 00:04:59,879
to seize your car and take your property

112
00:04:57,418 --> 00:05:01,680
and deny your student loans and prevent

113
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:05,279
you from teaching in Community Schools

114
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:07,740
it's wrong it's unjust and you you must

115
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:10,379
individually stand up and be counted

116
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:12,000
today so that you don't become the

117
00:05:10,379 --> 00:05:14,399
criminal the accused criminal tomorrow

118
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,319
so that you won't have to stand up in a

119
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:19,019
court of law and choose between whether

120
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:22,079
or not you want your freedom or to cop a

121
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:24,060
plate and accept drug testing
