1
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,960
and i had my head way up in the clouds

2
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,840
home

3
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:31,118
see them people they weren't as friendly

4
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:35,439
they had all been traumatized

5
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:40,079
by the rush of this civilization

6
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:40,078
they all were trapped inside

7
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:59,680
get that far

8
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:03,840
and they prey upon each other

9
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:08,159
like it's some good healthy sport

10
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:13,080
and their idea of a wilderness

11
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:13,079
a condo at the resort

12
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:36,959
they only make rules that benefit

13
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:40,238
the ones that lock you up and there's

14
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:44,400
nothing much more to say

15
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:48,800
except this whole place is damn corrupt

16
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:52,640
so i'm going back to my mountain

17
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:56,800
and there i'll spend my days

18
00:02:52,639 --> 00:03:00,878
and i'll make love to my mountain girl

19
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:06,439
and i'll smoke my ot hayes

20
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:06,439
and i'll live my old school ways

21
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,599
okay thank you jim
