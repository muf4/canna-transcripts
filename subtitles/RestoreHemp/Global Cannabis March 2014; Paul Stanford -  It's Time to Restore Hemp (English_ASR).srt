1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,278
it's the most productive crop produces

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:08,400
more fuel from its seed oil and its

3
00:00:05,278 --> 00:00:09,439
biomass and ethanol more fiber from its

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,240
stems

5
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:12,959
for

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,719
canvas rope lace linen paper and

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,440
building materials

8
00:00:14,718 --> 00:00:19,439
and more food from its seeds the best

9
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,600
protein known to man

10
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:24,640
so to take the oldest and most

11
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,679
productive crop and to prohibit that one

12
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:30,000
is evil and we're here to protest that

13
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:31,920
to restore hip to its rightful place in

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,640
our economy

15
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:37,679
if you look right up there

16
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:40,719
where that mark emery sign is being held

17
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:42,840

18
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:45,840
so we're going to start when we come

19
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:49,359
