1
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:11,300
I wrote this song to see 30

2
00:00:08,339 --> 00:00:11,300
four years ago

3
00:00:12,859 --> 00:00:18,480
yeah that's right

4
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:20,399
and it's called The Sovereign I hate to

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,939
have to keep singing it but as long as I

6
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:22,939
do I will

7
00:00:53,719 --> 00:01:00,300
victim of a tangled yeah

8
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:02,698
in South Dakota where the fear was

9
00:01:00,299 --> 00:01:05,280
thrown the president so I spent my mind

10
00:01:02,698 --> 00:01:07,019
in the stone they said all people we're

11
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,579
free at our own there was a struggle for

12
00:01:07,019 --> 00:01:10,579
freedom in the Indian home

13
00:01:10,938 --> 00:01:16,438
how many had gone before

14
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:20,659
tell me how many more

15
00:01:16,438 --> 00:01:20,658
must be lost to the Indian War

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,560
the companies look to the high command

17
00:01:25,978 --> 00:01:31,978
and we need to tease to the Indian land

18
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:35,719
to dig for oil and uranium ore and maybe

19
00:01:31,978 --> 00:01:39,359
have to start a little Indian War

20
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:42,298
the orders came from away on high that

21
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:44,938
there was a job for the FBI it won't be

22
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:48,860
hard I will have to do they just cause a

23
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:48,859
little tether than part of it through

24
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:53,240
thank you

25
00:01:56,118 --> 00:02:00,899
know bladder where the spirit that dwell

26
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:03,599
if there was a time that they remembered

27
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:07,099
women and children were gathered there

28
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:07,099
but when the wind blew alone

29
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:15,479
of those who came to the call in the

30
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:17,459
time arose in dangerous strangers are

31
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:20,659
prowling around bring a double through

32
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:23,280
the reservation round

33
00:02:20,659 --> 00:02:25,680
and that was when the agents are made

34
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,020
their play and I got a soft battle on a

35
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:31,379
deadly day and three men died in Lakota

36
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:33,379
land to FBI

37
00:02:31,378 --> 00:02:33,378
en

38
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:40,620
how many have gone before

39
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:43,640
tell me how many more must be lost to

40
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:43,640
the Indian War

41
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,039
oh

42
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:55,919
Joseph was a man that died that day but

43
00:02:53,878 --> 00:02:58,219
the eyes of the law didn't seem to see

44
00:02:55,919 --> 00:03:01,878
all they cared about was their own kind

45
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:01,878
gonna get somebody

46
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:08,459
the charge was set for homicide but

47
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,319
Landon got away

48
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:12,539
where we lived for a while in the

49
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:16,039
northern town till they came up and got

50
00:03:12,539 --> 00:03:16,039
it man they brought him back down

51
00:03:30,259 --> 00:03:35,598
they said two times late in a federal

52
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:35,598
cell

53
00:03:35,878 --> 00:03:41,459
Temptations came from a Washington

54
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:44,340
congratulations on a job well done two

55
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:46,140
agents gone is a mighty place but if you

56
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:48,239
want something bad you gotta suck her a

57
00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:50,579
face

58
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:53,039
I took a lemon Pelt here up away in

59
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:54,780
Chains all of those years after suffer

60
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:56,519
in pain all that all of those years

61
00:03:54,780 --> 00:04:00,140
makes a worry you're strong and the

62
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:00,140
struggle of the people goes on

63
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:07,919
how many have gone before to tell me how

64
00:04:05,098 --> 00:04:10,818
many more you must be lost to the Indian

65
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:10,818
Wars

66
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,260
thank you

67
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:29,159
stunts was a lower down the winds did

68
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:32,280
blow with the mighty sound the answer

69
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:35,300
came in the driving ring this man will

70
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:38,579
not have died in thee

71
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:40,620
for the hollow power of the lock and key

72
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:42,659
ain't nothing to the power of the rage

73
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:43,800
inside the lightning strikes in the

74
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:47,720
angry Skies

75
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:50,100
puts the power into people's eyes

76
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:52,320
although the weather is building to a

77
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:54,900
mighty storm and the words and the wind

78
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:59,659
will come to warm are once more spoken

79
00:04:54,899 --> 00:04:59,659
to your ear only this time the name is

80
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:10,639
tell me how many more must be lost to

81
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:10,639
the Indian world

82
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:15,959
foreign
