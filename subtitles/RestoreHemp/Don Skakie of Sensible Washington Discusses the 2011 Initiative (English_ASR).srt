1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:04,599
you're representing this this new

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:07,799
initiative drive up in in Washington

3
00:00:04,599 --> 00:00:11,558
state to basically remove all penalties

4
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:14,638
from Cannabis possession and and uh use

5
00:00:11,558 --> 00:00:16,480
sales transport cultivation all the laws

6
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:17,439
against cannabis right what's the

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,960
process you got to go through in

8
00:00:17,439 --> 00:00:22,480
Washington now what do you do well the

9
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:25,800
initiative process we need to get

10
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,640
251,000 valid signatures from voters

11
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,439
okay but the reason it's going to work

12
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:32,960
is the language follows uh initiative 61

13
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:34,799
from 1923 in New York that ended

14
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,520
prohibition Statewide 10 years before

15
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:39,078
the rest of the country and it just

16
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,600
doesn't conflict with federal law

17
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:44,320
because we don't create any uh

18
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,960
regulation or any language at all that

19
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,238
that could be preemptive federally MH

20
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:52,799
and it just simply removes State

21
00:00:49,238 --> 00:00:54,519
penalties civil and criminal so uh a lot

22
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:57,238
of people say well you know they change

23
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:58,559
the laws all the time up there but what

24
00:00:57,238 --> 00:01:00,479
we're really doing is we're creating an

25
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:02,439
opportunity for the legislature to step

26
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:04,359
up and listen to the citizens of how

27
00:01:02,439 --> 00:01:06,200
they want that's right uh cannabis

28
00:01:04,359 --> 00:01:07,319
regulated and taxed and what what length

29
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,400
of time do you have to gather those

30
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:12,079
signatures in we are going to file our

31
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:14,359
initiative in January uh we should have

32
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:17,599
our paper hit the street in February we

33
00:01:14,359 --> 00:01:18,959
have until June 30th you have a a a time

34
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:20,359
period where you have to clear things

35
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:21,719
like through the state attorney general

36
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:24,000
or through the you know whatever

37
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:27,118
Department we will file early January

38
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,118
then uh they have 14 days to research it

39
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:34,239
okay we filed this already as initiative

40
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:36,359
1068 in 2010 MH uh we grew as an

41
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:38,078
organization and uh it it was all

42
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:40,239
Grassroots we didn't have any paid

43
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:42,478
gatherers uh some paid gatherers were

44
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:44,519
out there working for us some were out

45
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:47,158
there using us uh for their own benefit

46
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:49,560
and didn't turn their signatures in but

47
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:51,640
we're going to avoid that we've got uh

48
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:54,159
over 6,000 people this year that have

49
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:56,599
expressed an interest in helping out and

50
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,799
if that's the case and only half of them

51
00:01:56,599 --> 00:02:02,000
uh step up and make a commitment then

52
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,799
that means we need 100 each for uh over

53
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,078
5 months period so basically if

54
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:08,039
everybody gets one signature a day and

55
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:09,359
only half the people that commit do it

56
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:10,678
we're on the ballot so you have a

57
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,879
five-month period you have to get this

58
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:15,920
in okay we're shooting for 420 uhhuh so

59
00:02:13,878 --> 00:02:17,639
is that an initiative that's directly to

60
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:19,679
the people or is that an initiative to

61
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:21,839
the legislature I know in Washington

62
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,400
there is this other process there that

63
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,360
it gives you a little bit longer period

64
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:28,439
of time to collect signatures it does

65
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:31,160
give you a year but then the legislature

66
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:33,359
can also uh create a competing

67
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:35,439
initiative right like okay the citizens

68
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,560
say this but we say this so you really

69
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:39,400
split the vote that way with an

70
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,039
initiative to the people you're really

71
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:43,719
give the chance to say this is what we

72
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:46,239
really want and uh the numbers will show

73
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:47,919
it the the the response from the public

74
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,039
as time went on and they became aware a

75
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:51,238
lot of people didn't even know we were

76
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:52,439
out there but when they found out we

77
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:55,280
were out there it's like where have you

78
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:57,039
been I want to sign this m and they want

79
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,800
it to pass so if people want to contact

80
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:00,598
the campaign what's the best way for

81
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:04,360
them to do so yeah sensible

82
00:03:00,598 --> 00:03:06,280
washington.org is our website uh there's

83
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:08,640
right now our website's in transition

84
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:11,199
from the barebones that we have left

85
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:13,559
over from uh last year we are working on

86
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:15,719
a really awesome new website that's

87
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:18,039
going to have a lot of information it's

88
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:20,039
going to be directed at the undecided

89
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:22,039
voters I mean we know that our True

90
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:24,560
Believers are going to support and vote

91
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:27,039
for us and we know that the the people

92
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,039
that absolutely will never support us uh

93
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:31,560
there's no Spence sense spending any

94
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:33,158
time on them yeah so we're going to aim

95
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,519
for the people in the middle that are

96
00:03:33,158 --> 00:03:37,359
worried about their children how will

97
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,560
this affect their children they're

98
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,560
worried about the economy how is the

99
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:45,840
$150 million we a year we save from not

100
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:47,840
arresting 14,000 people in Washington

101
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,319
going to affect the economy and how is

102
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,799
having them back at work instead of

103
00:03:49,318 --> 00:03:53,158
prison going to affect the

104
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:55,840
economy this will also cover hemp

105
00:03:53,158 --> 00:03:58,519
Industrial Hemp so we're expecting that

106
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:01,479
the hundred million uh Market that

107
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:02,920
Washington Imports to make products here

108

109
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:08,559
green jobs here in America right here in

110
00:04:05,158 --> 00:04:08,560
