1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,560
my background is uh having been a

2
00:00:01,879 --> 00:00:05,960
criminal defense attorney for gosh 11

3
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:08,800
years 12 years and then going to the

4
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:11,719
ACLU of Washington where I'm still the

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:14,200
drug policy director um but this year

6
00:00:11,718 --> 00:00:16,839
the ACLU of Washington made me an

7
00:00:14,199 --> 00:00:18,839
in-kind contribution to the new approach

8
00:00:16,839 --> 00:00:20,839
Washington Campaign which is the

9
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:24,039
campaign that has filed a full

10
00:00:20,839 --> 00:00:25,118
legalization initiative initiative 502

11
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:27,240
which is an initiative to the

12
00:00:25,118 --> 00:00:29,759
legislature it'll go in front of the

13
00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:32,159
Washington State Legislature in January

14
00:00:29,759 --> 00:00:34,878
they may pass it if they do we celebrate

15
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:37,398
we go home but assuming that they don't

16
00:00:34,878 --> 00:00:40,320
it will then go on to the November 2012

17
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:42,759
uh ballot and be put to the voters here

18
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,799
and just following up on this the same

19
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:47,718
uh observations that David and Dale have

20
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:53,039
already made is that we are in this

21
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:55,600
amazing moment of opportunity and also

22
00:00:53,039 --> 00:01:00,198
precariousness there is no state in the

23
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:03,320
country that has over 55 maybe maybe a

24
00:01:00,198 --> 00:01:05,239
good day 56% support for majority uh

25
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,719
majority support for legalizing

26
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:08,719
marijuana and of course it depends on

27
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:10,560
how you ask the question and then once

28
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:13,599
you start to drill down into a more

29
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:16,000
specific proposal the support gets a

30
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:19,679
little bit softer right now here in

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,599
Washington we've got 54% support for

32
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,439
some very specific proposals that have

33
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:25,798
been tested that track pretty closely to

34
00:01:24,438 --> 00:01:29,679
what the ballot title and the ballot

35
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:33,640
summary for i502 is but 54% is not a

36
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:37,280
huge majority what we all know is that

37
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:38,680
for many many years 75% of the American

38
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,640
public has said that the War on Drugs is

39
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:44,040
a failure zogby poll tells us that all

40
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:46,799
the time what we don't have is majority

41
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:49,799
support for the answer the answer is

42
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,960
what scares people the answer is where

43
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:54,560
you have to nail down the details the

44
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:58,000
answer is is what happened with

45
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:00,359
proposition 19 they had great support

46
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,438
going into a year out before it got to

47
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:05,200
the uh ballot and they did a great job

48
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:07,798
with how much erosion of support they

49
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:10,878
had coming at 46% was great for

50
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:12,360
California in in an off year but people

51
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:14,318
started to get really scared when they

52
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:16,040
started to look at the details when they

53
00:02:14,318 --> 00:02:18,119
started to try to figure out how it was

54
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:19,799
actually going to be implemented um

55
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,200
there wasn't a Statewide regulatory

56
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,800
system they weren't sure how that was

57
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:25,759
going to work and people started to talk

58
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,879
about scary things like Stone drivers

59
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:29,560
and we saw that the people that should

60
00:02:27,878 --> 00:02:32,199
have been with us setting aside for a

61
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:35,039
moment the whole uh Emerald uh uh

62
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:36,839
triangle hul County issue but we saw the

63
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:39,359
people that we should have had the

64
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:42,519
moderate Democrats the conservative

65
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,599
Democrats the college educated women The

66
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:47,400
Independents we saw their support peel

67
00:02:44,598 --> 00:02:49,119
off at the end right before and here in

68
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,760
Washington our public opinion research

69
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,360
identifies the exact same people as

70
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:55,878
being the people who are our soft

71
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:58,440
supporters our soft supporters are those

72
00:02:55,878 --> 00:03:01,598
conservative to moderate Democrats

73
00:02:58,439 --> 00:03:04,359
college educated women mothers and

74
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:07,719
Independence and if you address their

75
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:10,319
concerns you can hold on to them but

76
00:03:07,719 --> 00:03:13,560
that is that is a very difficult thing

77
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:17,158
to do that is a a difficult needle to

78
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:19,560
thread and so with i502 we spent a lot

79
00:03:17,158 --> 00:03:22,719
of time figuring out what is the most

80
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:25,519
conservative safe secure sounding

81
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:27,359
marijuana legalization initiative that

82
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,840
we can draft and what will get us

83
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,280
closest to what our public opinion

84
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:32,920
research tells us

85
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:36,039
people will hang on to and

86
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:38,199
pass I some of you are probably familiar

87
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:40,719
with Nate Silver's meta analysis of

88
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:42,959
national polling on um support for

89
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:45,158
marijuana legalization in the country

90
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:48,438
and you saw that back in the 70s we made

91
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:51,359
so much progress in changing our

92
00:03:48,438 --> 00:03:54,280
marijuana laws we had 12 States pass

93
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:57,439
decriminalization laws back in the 70s

94
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:59,318
and then the 80s came and you can see

95
00:03:57,438 --> 00:04:00,878
the support go in the opposite direction

96
00:03:59,318 --> 00:04:02,839
very quickly

97
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:05,359
and now we're getting back closer and in

98
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:08,039
2009 you look at Nate Silver's graph of

99
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:10,640
support versus opposition for marijuana

100
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:14,359
legalization and we are this close to

101
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:17,599
the Tipping Point this close and 2012

102
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:20,600
could be the year when some State maybe

103
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,800
two states maybe three states has just

104
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:24,800
enough to push the rock over the top of

105
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,560
the mountain and people will see that

106
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,720
the sky doesn't fall and we're able to

107
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:33,439
get M momentum to make better and better

108
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:36,039
marijuana laws but how you get that rock

109
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:38,560
over the top of the mountain is the

110
00:04:36,038 --> 00:04:40,800
that's where the the devil is in the

111
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,439
details so I'm sure we're going to we're

112
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,439
going to talk about the devils in the

113
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:45,759
details of i502 I know that people have

114
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:47,719
a lot of concerns about some of the

115
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:50,520
things that are there but I'm here to

116
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:52,360
tell you that what we all need to be

117
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:55,439
thinking about most importantly is how

118
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:58,680
do we hold on to the 54% is that even

119
00:04:55,439 --> 00:05:02,000
possible and can we push something that

120
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:04,519
at its at its core it's legalization of

121
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,959
marijuana for adults because if we can

122
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:07,839
just get the ball on the other side and

123
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:09,719
I don't know how many different

124
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:12,879
metaphors here but if we can just get

125
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:15,479
past that hurdle we can fix a lot

126
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:17,399
afterwards but we are still right now

127
00:05:15,478 --> 00:05:20,680
you know here in Washington it's still a

128
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:23,359
misdemeanor to possess marijuana and it

129
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:25,918
carries a mandatory 24 hours in jail and

130
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,879
a $250 fine and it can mess with your

131
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:30,038
federal financial aid and those of us

132
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:32,439
who live here in Seattle think that

133
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:33,839
we're fine but you know you go to click

134
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:35,038
attack County and it's a completely

135
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:37,679
different

136
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:39,719
experience so um that's where we're

137
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,079
coming from with new approach Washington

138
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:44,080
i502 is that we see that there's a

139
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:46,918
possibility but we think it's a very

140
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:48,519
slim possibility and we have to do

141
00:05:46,918 --> 00:05:50,439
everything and be as disciplined as

142
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:53,240
possible and pulling together for

143
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:55,319
example the sponsors that signed on to

144
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:57,759
it Seattle City attorney Pete Holmes

145
00:05:55,319 --> 00:06:00,479
former US Attorney John McCay Rick

146
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:03,240
Steves two medical doctors

147
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:06,478
uh two former Washington State Bar

148
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:09,000
presidents a Washington state legislator

149
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:11,959
we need all the mainstream Messengers

150
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,839
possible because I think a legalization

151
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:15,399
initiative that looks like it's coming

152
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:17,560
from the choir that looks like it's

153
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:20,079
coming from The Usual Suspects has a

154
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:22,160
much harder road too than one that's

155
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:24,478
coming from a former US attorney for

156
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,599
example so that's kind of the big

157
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:27,680
overview of of where our head is right

158
00:06:26,598 --> 00:06:31,560
now and what we're hoping to get

159
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,560
accomplished within the next 15 months
