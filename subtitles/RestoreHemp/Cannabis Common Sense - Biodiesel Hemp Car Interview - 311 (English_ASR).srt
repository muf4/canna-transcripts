1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,440
we have another film clip we're going to

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:08,849
run right now this is an interview I did

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:10,800
with the driver of the hemp car Greg

4
00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:12,750
Kyler he came through here about three

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,450
years ago the hip car was running on a

6
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,969
hundred percent hemp seed oil there was

7
00:00:15,449 --> 00:00:21,149
no petroleum in the gas tank no

8
00:00:17,969 --> 00:00:23,518
petroleum oil lubricating the engine it

9
00:00:21,149 --> 00:00:25,469
was a hundred percent hemp driven car

10
00:00:23,518 --> 00:00:26,879
and that's what we need to go back to in

11
00:00:25,469 --> 00:00:28,649
the future and we'll be talking a bit

12
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:31,428
more about that just a moment hope you

13
00:00:28,649 --> 00:00:31,428
enjoy this film clip

14
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,700
yep so how did you come to think of this

15
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:36,579
the hip car idea and this this national

16
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:38,500
tour you're doing well I was I wanted to

17
00:01:36,579 --> 00:01:41,140
come out to the west coast and some kind

18
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:43,689
of environmental fashion and I've been

19
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:47,259
researching deals for a while it's never

20
00:01:43,689 --> 00:01:51,250
really cared about came across can't

21
00:01:47,259 --> 00:01:52,930
boil a transportation fuel and put two

22
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:54,939
and two together you know when was that

23
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:56,979
when did you ever back in October of

24
00:01:54,939 --> 00:02:00,009
last year October last year right around

25
00:01:56,978 --> 00:02:02,920
there and started asking you know how

26
00:02:00,009 --> 00:02:05,649
come they took a look into the plant a

27
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:08,409
little more my nod not a drug still

28
00:02:05,649 --> 00:02:10,449
falls under the DEA band so put two and

29
00:02:08,409 --> 00:02:12,759
two together and decided that I had to

30
00:02:10,449 --> 00:02:15,789
do it with your oil and so you're

31
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:18,459
getting hip oil from Ohio yeah it's

32
00:02:15,789 --> 00:02:20,889
literally name from China on some from

33
00:02:18,459 --> 00:02:22,569
Canada and then it's some of it comes

34
00:02:20,889 --> 00:02:24,818
into a high or it's made new biodiesel

35
00:02:22,569 --> 00:02:27,489
the John Ross chapter at the Ohio

36
00:02:24,818 --> 00:02:29,888
and this retired swearingen of apple

37
00:02:27,489 --> 00:02:32,980
energy who practices the oil for us into

38
00:02:29,889 --> 00:02:35,920
biodiesel uh-huh what can you tell us

39
00:02:32,979 --> 00:02:38,888
about the car to just normal car without

40
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:42,818
completely unmodified Mercedes these old

41
00:02:38,889 --> 00:02:45,310
1983 turbo diesel any diesel engine can

42
00:02:42,818 --> 00:02:47,318
rot burn any vegetable oil but you'll

43
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:50,829
get a longer engine life turning into by

44
00:02:47,318 --> 00:02:52,449
people so that's what we're doing what

45

51
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:13,209
about seven weeks we've been on the road

52
00:03:09,669 --> 00:03:14,469
and uncover it at 6,400 miles six

53
00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:16,209
thousand four hundred miles and how many

54
00:03:14,468 --> 00:03:18,370
cities are you going to and tova make

55
00:03:16,209 --> 00:03:20,650
we're going to about 50 cities in how

56
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:24,340
many days is that I sent about a little

57
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:26,319
over 90 days 50 cities in 90 days that's

58
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:28,718
ambitious yeah and that's a hundred

59
00:03:26,318 --> 00:03:30,668
percent hemp fuel yep and what kind of

60
00:03:28,718 --> 00:03:32,469
mileage do you get 27 miles to go on

61
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:34,180
just like the car came from the factory

62
00:03:32,469 --> 00:03:35,949
floor and so it's being shipped to you

63
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:38,409
along the yet we have 12 like draw

64
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:40,739
points and we have our fuel ship ahead

65
00:03:38,408 --> 00:03:43,478
and we pick up as much as we can carry

66
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:46,000
okay that was grand kryger with the hemp

67
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:48,159
car and that was running on a hundred

68
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,259
percent hemp seed oil now we're talking

69
00:03:48,158 --> 00:03:52,688
you know the price of oil has gone

70
00:03:50,258 --> 00:03:54,728
through the roof lately demand in the

71
00:03:52,688 --> 00:03:57,668
United States continues to grow slowly

72
00:03:54,729 --> 00:04:01,599
but the demand in India the demand in

73
00:03:57,669 --> 00:04:04,870
China is doubling every year so they're

74
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:05,948
saying by the end of the year that the

75
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:08,799
price of oil is going to be a hundred

76
00:04:05,949 --> 00:04:11,349
dollars a barrel well hemp seed oil can

77
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,879
compete at those prices and hip is

78
00:04:11,348 --> 00:04:16,538
actually three times more productive

79
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:19,629
than any other seed oil crop so the

80
00:04:16,538 --> 00:04:23,680
price of biodiesel come way down when we

81
00:04:19,629 --> 00:04:26,949
can grow moderately high THC plants hemp

82
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:29,050
plants for biodiesel and that's what our

83
00:04:26,949 --> 00:04:31,770
political committee is going to start

84
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:33,788
concentrating on a hip for biodiesel

85
00:04:31,769 --> 00:04:37,019
initiative so we'll be talking more

86
00:04:33,788 --> 00:04:37,019
about that in the weeks to come
