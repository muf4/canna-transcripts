2
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:06,278
support this great Great Rally that we

3
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:07,679
have for freedom we're marching today

4
00:00:06,278 --> 00:00:09,759
we're Marching for cannabis we're

5
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:12,558
Marching for Freedom we're Marching for

6
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:14,798
our rights to make things happen in our

7
00:00:12,558 --> 00:00:18,000
community I met a group of people out in

8
00:00:14,798 --> 00:00:19,879
Harrisburg Oregon who decided that they

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,960
they they would like to

10
00:00:19,879 --> 00:00:26,559
import hemp excuse me from Spain through

11
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:28,760
France and so we did and we had to get

12
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:31,000
the dea's permission so we imported this

13
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:33,439
hemp and then we took that hemp and we

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,039
made Boards out of

15
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:38,119
it it's really a nice guitar and this is

16
00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:41,000
a really old piece of wood that the wood

17
00:00:38,119 --> 00:00:43,759
is older than the the guitar so what's

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,640
going on is I've got this piece of wood

19
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:50,039
that's 20 years old and it has an age

20
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,719
today right and it was made out of hemp

21
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:53,960
fibers that we imported from Spain

22
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:56,039
through France and we were able to prove

23
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:58,799
through this piece of wood right here or

24
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:00,679
actually medium density fiber board that

25
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:04,118
we could actually create medium density

26
00:01:00,679 --> 00:01:05,920
fiber board and that because of that we

27
00:01:04,118 --> 00:01:10,759
have the ability to

28
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:12,840
change the the dynamic in the woods okay

29
00:01:10,759 --> 00:01:15,319
now we proved this 20 years ago but

30
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,439
because we do not have anywhere in the

31
00:01:15,319 --> 00:01:20,000
world we do not have enough adequate

32
00:01:17,438 --> 00:01:22,519
Supply to actually do it I mean nobody's

33
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,118
growing hemp fields in United States

34
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:25,920
unless you run out in Nebraska and get

35
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:28,400
some of the ditch weed I mean it is

36
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,040
everywhere you know it is you've seen it

37
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,840
and that's what's going on you know we

38
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:34,880
we just don't have a real Supply if we

39
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:37,520
ever had a supply I mean tomorrow we

40
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:39,438
could be producing Boards out of hemp we

41
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:42,679
could be turning all the herd in the

42
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:46,158
inside of the stock into Visos and and

43
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:48,439
making you know chairs for astronauts

44
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,759
that would never break you know we could

45
00:01:48,438 --> 00:01:52,239
do things that you couldn't you could

46
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:54,718
even imagine but we we actually can't

47
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:56,239
cuz we got a big imagination so one of

48
00:01:54,718 --> 00:01:58,519
the reasons that I keep fighting and

49
00:01:56,239 --> 00:02:03,280
I've been doing this for over 30 years

50
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:05,039
is I believe I believe I believe one of

51
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,000
the things um folks you got to remember

lot of people don't take this very

166
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,120
seriously Even in our own Community

167
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,639
sometimes they just think it's about

168
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,959
getting high let me tell you a little

169
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,319
story about my home state of Idaho I

170
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:43,839
just got back from Idaho because a

171
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,840
friend of mine named Lindsay Reinhardt

172
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:48,318
who is the chief petitioner for their

173
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:50,478
medical marijuana bill out there she's a

174
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,680
multiple sclerosis patient there was an

175
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:55,478
incident at school some kid got a hold

176
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:57,038
of some weed so naturally they blamed

177
00:06:55,478 --> 00:06:58,758
her kid for giving it to them even

178
00:06:57,038 --> 00:07:00,279
though there was no evidence of that

179
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:04,240
just because she's the top medical

180
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:05,878
marijuana person and then sent cops to

181
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,759
her house took her kids away to foster

182
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:11,039
care and now she's facing felony

183
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:13,800
charges that same exact

184
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:16,120
week there was a case just across the

185
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:18,280
county where a woman left her

186
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:22,160
three-year-old and her 10-month-old in

187
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:23,719
the car alone went back into the house

188
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:27,439
neglecting the fact that she had a

189
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:29,520
loaded 45 in the car the three-year-old

190
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:32,839
got a hold of the loaded 45 and shot the

191
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:35,359
10-month old in the cheek did she get

192
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:38,799
her kids taken away from her for child

193
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,319
endangerment no did the cops come to her

194
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,280
house and start to charge her with

195
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:45,199
endangering kids and feel like they need

196
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:47,439
to be put in foster care no but the

197
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:51,038
multiple sclerosis patient who's using

198
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:54,319
cannabis as medicine is a danger to her

199
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:57,759
kids that ain't right and this is not

200
00:07:54,319 --> 00:08:01,560
just an isolated case look up Daisy Bram

201
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:04,280

203
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:09,478
medical marijuana since 1996 she's been

204
00:08:07,478 --> 00:08:11,839
charged with child endangerment because

205
00:08:09,478 --> 00:08:14,120
she was breastfeeding and she's a

206
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:16,679
medical marijuana patient and they say

207
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:19,319
oh you're passing canono through the

208
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:21,478
breast milk to your baby despite the

209
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:24,479
fact that breast milk naturally has

210
00:08:21,478 --> 00:08:28,878
canabo in it in the first

211
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:30,639
place I found five cases in the past

212
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:33,038
week

213
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,879
where children aged four and under had

214
00:08:33,038 --> 00:08:37,879
gotten a hold of a loaded weapon and

215
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:40,679
fired it either hurting or killing

216
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:43,360
themselves another kid or an adult five

217
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:45,719
cases not one of those cases where the

218
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,080
parents charged with child endangerment

219
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:51,639
or neglect or being Reckless or any

220
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:53,639
charge it was just an accident oops you

221
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:56,600
left your kid alone with a loaded weapon

222
00:08:53,639 --> 00:09:00,000
oops just an accident that same week I

223
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:02,079
found five more cases of people busted

224
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,240
for having a marijuana plant in their

225
00:09:02,078 --> 00:09:06,199
home where they were charged with child

226
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:09,720
endangerment and the kids were put into

227
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:12,120
foster care wow that's why I come out

228
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:14,680
here every year to March that's why I

229
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:17,560
fly coach all over this country to talk

230
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:19,479
to people and that's why I will not stop

231
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:21,479
until we have the same equal rights as

232
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:23,519
our beer drinking friends are you with

233
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:26,680
[Music]

234
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:28,039
me now remember activism starts with act

235
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:30,120
and you've done the first thing by

236
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:33,240
acting today you went out and more than

237
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:34,959
99% of any cannabis activist ever does

238
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,240
and you put your feet on the street and

239
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:40,239
you put your face in public showing that

240
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:42,639
you support this so give yourselves a

241
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:45,079
hand and remember this is not where it

242
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:47,958
ends we have bills in the legislature

243
00:09:45,078 --> 00:09:49,719
right now to reduce the penalties for

244
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:52,838
possession of marijuana between 1 ounces

245
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:55,240
and 4 ounces we have bills to add PTSD

246
00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:56,959
to the medical marijuana conditions we

247
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:59,399
have bills that would actually just

248
00:09:56,958 --> 00:10:02,958
outright legalize marijuana but they

249
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:04,679
ain't going nowhere unless you talk to

250
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:06,799

251
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:08,120
officials now I know it's like not

252
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:09,919
they're not on your speed dial or

253
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:11,639
nothing I know it's not like the first

254
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:13,599
person you're going to call every day

255
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:16,278
but talk to this guy National cannabis

256

00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:30,120
your name as long as you're marching

263
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:32,479

together talk to your legislators we can

266
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:38,560
get positive progress here in Oregon and

267
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:40,439
one final

268
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:41,799
thing there's some people at the

269
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,959
national level and I get to talk to a

270
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:49,639
lot of them on a direct basis who think

271
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:52,479
Oregan ought to wait till 2016 to go for

272
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:54,120
legalization they say in 2016 it'll be a

273
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:57,879
slam

274
00:10:54,120 --> 00:11:00,039
dunk well what I don't understand is why

275
00:10:57,879 --> 00:11:01,879
wouldn't it be a slam dunk even if we

276
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:06,000
did try in

277
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:08,439
2014 why not try the 7 foot Jumper in

278
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,200
2014 and if it doesn't go in we'll

279
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:14,160
rebound and do the slam dunk in 2016

280
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:16,600
sounds right to me let's fight for 2014

281
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:18,679
and let's fight for 2016 because I don't

282
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:21,959
know about you but there are

283
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:23,919
199 oregonians getting arrested every

284
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:26,479
month for marijuana and remember

285
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:30,199
marijuana's decrim here anything over an

286
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:32,720
ounce is a felony so that's 199t felony

287
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:35,399
arrests every month those people can't

288
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:38,680
wait till 2016 let's get the ball done

289

marijuana uh for you know all adults uh

302
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:13,759

into 2014 that will legalized marijuana

305

306
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:24,199
great provision I encourage you to check

307
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:25,679
that out we got PTSD added as a

308
00:12:24,198 --> 00:12:29,240
qualifying condition under the medical

309
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:31,599
marijuana act that passed the Senate uh

310
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:34,879
reducing marijuana penalties for 29

311
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,600
grams to uh 112 grams so it's no longer

312
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:38,919
a felony it's a misdemeanor that's

313
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:42,240
likely to pass this year Oregon's likely

314
00:12:38,919 --> 00:12:44,000

315
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,879
the Oregon legislature this year and

316
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,919
it's done because of activist it's done

317

I want to ask you to do two things okay

350
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:10,239
the first thing is that you know I'm a

351
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,320
proud member of the normal legal

352
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:15,399
committee National Organization to

353
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:17,560
reform the marijuana laws and uh and our

354
00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:20,278
legal committee is about 450 lawyers

355
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:22,119
nationally and we look after uh folks

356
00:14:20,278 --> 00:14:23,759
that are charged with cannabis related

357
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:26,240
offenses and we do education and

358
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:28,440
Outreach and other stuff but lately

359
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:31,120
lately the leaders of normal Allan St

360
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:33,160
Pierre the executive director and uh

361
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,078
Keith stro the legal counsel have been

362
00:14:33,159 --> 00:14:37,319
making public statements that aren't

363
00:14:35,078 --> 00:14:38,679
really what normal's about Allan's been

364
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:41,320
saying for example that medical

365
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:43,359
marijuana is a sham normal doesn't think

366
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:46,480
medical marijuana is a sham but Allan

367
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:49,320
says that publicly he says oh 5

368
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:51,480
nanograms that's okay you know that's

369
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:53,199
probably a reasonable level for uh

370
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:55,159
driving on the influence and that's not

371
00:14:53,198 --> 00:14:59,879
normal's position at all normal's been

372
00:14:55,159 --> 00:15:02,600
fighting hard to to uh to to make sure

373
00:14:59,879 --> 00:15:06,000
that there aren't per se driving on the

374
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:07,278
influence laws passed and uh so what I'd

375
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,320
like you to do the first thing I'm going

376
00:15:07,278 --> 00:15:11,519
to ask you to do is I want you to write

377
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:15,680

381
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:27,079
and ask him to knock it off to quit

382
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:31,599

383

00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:12,199
health committee in the house on the

400

house and then the governor is going to

402
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:19,919
sign it and then we're going to have

403
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:22,529
PTSD finally as a condition that will

404
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:24,240
qualify patients in Oregon

405
00:16:22,529 --> 00:16:27,318
[Applause]

406
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:29,120
yeah I I caught up with Russ Belleville

407
00:16:27,318 --> 00:16:30,679
about a week after he stopped with

408
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:33,078
working with normal and said what should

409
00:16:30,679 --> 00:16:35,198
we do Russ you know in the in the

410
00:16:33,078 --> 00:16:37,599
session Russ said you know it makes me

411
00:16:35,198 --> 00:16:40,639
crazy that in Washington because this

412
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:42,959
before it was legalized sort of and uh

413
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:46,560
not sort of before but sort of legalized

414
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:48,479
and in Idaho and even Utah and

415
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:51,719
California all have misdemeanor

416
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:55,199
marijuana laws but in Oregon if it's

417
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:57,240
less than an ounce it's a violation but

418
00:16:55,198 --> 00:17:01,159
more than an ounce it's a felony in any

419
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:03,759
amount of hashes or hash oil or honey

420
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:06,279
oil or anything that's derived from the

421
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:10,759
plant is a felony no matter what the

422
00:17:06,279 --> 00:17:14,599
quantity is well I know guess

423
00:17:10,759 --> 00:17:18,640
what the the the Oregan Senate I want to

424
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:20,918
say 18 to 12 passed a law that says if

425
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:23,679
it's more than an ounce but less than 4

426
00:17:20,919 --> 00:17:25,880
oz it's a misdemeanor and if it's less

427
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:27,439
than a quarter ounce of hashish or hash

428
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:29,799
oil it's a

429
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:31,919
misdemeanor that's going to go to the

430
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:34,480
house it's going to pass the house it's

431
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:36,360
going to go to the to the governor and

432
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,599
it's going to become the law we're going

433
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:40,719
to have thisd demeanor marijuana in

434
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:43,038
Oregon there's another bill that that

435
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:46,679
the Oregon criminal defense lawyer

436
00:17:43,038 --> 00:17:48,720
Association has has worked on that uh

437
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:50,160
you know if you I don't know if you know

438
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,919
but you know a lot of people get these

439
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,880
tickets for less than an ounce and just

440
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:55,400
pay the fine and next thing they know

441
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:57,480
they get a letter in a mail from the

442
00:17:55,400 --> 00:18:00,159

trust me that happens and and it's wrong

448
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:18,360
and the Oregon Senate voted I kid you

449
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:21,119
not 24 to six to make it that the the uh

450
00:18:18,359 --> 00:18:23,000
license suspension can't happen anymore

451
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:24,158
for less than an ounce and that bill is

452
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
going to go to the house and it's going

453
00:18:24,159 --> 00:18:27,320
to pass the house and it's going to get

454
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,798

477
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,440
Oregon to make the rest of these bills

478
00:19:26,839 --> 00:19:30,599

479
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,558
and God

480
00:19:30,599 --> 00:19:35,199
bless because you know as we all know um

481
00:19:33,558 --> 00:19:36,678
alcohol prohibition didn't really end

482
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,798
until the women got involved and I

483
00:19:36,679 --> 00:19:41,280
believe that's true for cannabis

484
00:19:37,798 --> 00:19:43,240
prohibition too so I although I'm not

485
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:45,599
speaking just to the women today I

486
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:47,240
really uh strongly suggest that it's

487
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:48,519
time for women to step up and stand next

488
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:50,519
to our brothers who have been fighting

489
00:19:48,519 --> 00:19:52,720
this fight for 40 years it's time for it

490
00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:55,359
to end people may not know it but

491
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:57,319
cannabis prohibition is over it's over

492
00:19:55,359 --> 00:19:59,038
it's just a matter of time and I keep

493
00:19:57,319 --> 00:20:00,399
hearing these large organizations tell

494
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:02,640
us to wait till

495
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:05,440
2014 wait till

496
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:09,080
2016 I'm tired of my brothers and

497
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:11,519
sisters getting put in jail I'm tired of

498
00:20:09,079 --> 00:20:13,678
kids being taken from their families

499
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:18,480
because they choose to use a perfectly

500
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:22,200
safe intoxicant after work I am tired of

501
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:24,839
being scrutinized for using a benign

502
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:26,840
plant as my way to relax in the evening

503
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:29,959
and I don't want to wait till

504
00:20:26,839 --> 00:20:33,158
2014 I don't want to wait till

505
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:36,360
2016 so I am calling my state

506

507
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:41,879
them it's time for them to support and

508

sentence please support and pass HB

529
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:49,918
3371 that ends it for all of

530
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:52,919
us and it ends it now that Bill creates

531
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:54,480
an emergency situation which would enact

532
00:21:52,919 --> 00:21:56,400
the law

533
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,720
immediately that means we don't have to

534
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,440
wait till MPP says we can do it in 20

535
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,960
2016 that means we don't have to wait

536
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:05,200
till normal says we can do it in 2014

537
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:07,679
that means we can do it now all you guys

538
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,360
got to do is call that's all it won't

539
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:11,679
take a huge amount of us to make those

540
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:13,719
calls to make this happen because they

541
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:16,278
take the impact of those phone calls as

542
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:18,200
being the voice of 20 of us so imagine

543
00:22:16,278 --> 00:22:19,960
that people every one of you out here

544
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:22,360
all hundred of you or however many there

545
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:25,600
are by you making a call you represent

546
00:22:22,359 --> 00:22:29,000
20 more of us by making that call you

547
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:32,158
represent 20 fellow cannabis consumers

548
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,119
so let's make this happen now let's not

549
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:35,799
wait I don't want to wait I don't want

550
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:38,798
people to go to jail anymore for weed

551
00:22:35,798 --> 00:22:42,079
it's stupid it's cost inefficient and

552
00:22:38,798 --> 00:22:47,359
it's just plain wrong so please join me

553
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:50,199
and call 800 332 2313 and Anna is

554
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:52,079
speaking on House Bill 3371 guys one

555
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:54,159
thing you need to realize about that is

556
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:55,720
like that's not us getting that together

557
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:57,919
that's the legislator getting that

558
00:22:55,720 --> 00:23:00,519
together that's them they're doing this

559
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:02,799
and so what they need is us to be the

560
00:23:00,519 --> 00:23:06,720
foot soldiers they need us to help them

561
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:08,319
so it's up to us to help them pass what

562
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,600
we need so sometimes that's how it

563
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:13,079
worked last year was measure 80 we

564
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:14,599
didn't get that past that was us the

565
00:23:13,079 --> 00:23:17,158
difference is is they're looking at

566
00:23:14,599 --> 00:23:19,399
Washington who is already legalized and

567
00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:20,960
now they are making a move because they

568
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:23,400
don't want Washington to make all the

569
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:25,278
tax money why do they want oregonians

570
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:27,038
going to Washington all you got to do is

571
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:28,919
drive across the bridge why do they want

572
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:31,240
that so they're being smart right now

573
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:33,320
guys and they need us to help them so

574
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:36,200
everybody pay attention as Lee Berger

575
00:23:33,319 --> 00:23:38,158
also talked about earlier PTSD and

576
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:40,000
there's other things you know you get

577
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:42,120
busted once you can lose your driver's

578
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,839
license are you kidding me I've known

579
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:45,678
people that that's happened to trying to

580
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:48,240
get that changed too so everyone pay

581
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:51,080
attention let's unite today under one

00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:09,080
trying to end prohibition like Anna said

588
00:24:06,519 --> 00:24:11,839
I'm tired tired tired of seeing my

589
00:24:09,079 --> 00:24:15,000
people go to jail I deal with women

590
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:17,599
every day and men that cry because their

591
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,839
children are taken away from them you

592
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:22,719
know you think medical marijuana is

593
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:25,278
enough but it's not enough to protect

594
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:29,038
your parental custody rights they will

595
00:24:25,278 --> 00:24:30,798
take your baby and just like Reinhardt

596
00:24:29,038 --> 00:24:32,798
is that what her name is Lindsay

597
00:24:30,798 --> 00:24:35,398
Reinhardt she came over here and spoke

598
00:24:32,798 --> 00:24:36,240
here for freedom and they took her baby

599
00:24:35,398 --> 00:24:39,359
from

600
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:42,558
her how can you think medical marijuana

601
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:45,158
is enough it is not enough when our

602
00:24:42,558 --> 00:24:47,440
people are being incarcerated when our

603
00:24:45,159 --> 00:24:50,520
economy is suffering while other Count's

604
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:51,679
economies prosper from Industrial Hemp

605
00:24:50,519 --> 00:24:54,000
it is

606
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:56,840
ridiculous and you know what the biggest

607
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:01,000
complaint as we moved forward with our

608
00:24:56,839 --> 00:25:03,558
um House Bill 33 71 was we didn't get

609
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,960
complaints from the state police we got

610
00:25:03,558 --> 00:25:08,639
complaints from the local sheriff saying

611
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:10,960
where's our cut so this is time for us

612
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:13,559
to do it you contact your

613
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:15,519
representatives and you let them know

614
00:25:13,558 --> 00:25:17,918
that it is time to move forward with

615
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:22,398
House Bill

616
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:26,120
3371 to allow us to build colleges and

617
00:25:22,398 --> 00:25:29,158

618
00:25:26,119 --> 00:25:32,239

00:25:40,599 --> 00:25:44,918
they are being

624
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:47,798
disproportionately not only um

625
00:25:44,919 --> 00:25:50,799
incarcerated but racial profiling is a

626
00:25:47,798 --> 00:25:53,398
huge problem Across the Nation our

627
00:25:50,798 --> 00:25:56,158
prisons are filled with blacks and

628
00:25:53,398 --> 00:26:00,239
whites poor whites and brown people like

629
