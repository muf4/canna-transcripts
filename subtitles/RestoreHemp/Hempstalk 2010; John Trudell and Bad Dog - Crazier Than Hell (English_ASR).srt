00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:23,640
Feeling crazier than hell.

3
00:00:21,278 --> 00:00:26,920
Got this time on my

4
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:31,399
hands and got you on my

5
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:34,840
mind and got nowhere else to

6
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:38,719
go. The fires burn hot and

7
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:41,000
cold. There's some place in between the

8
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:46,320
melt and the

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,320
freeze. This need for reaching for

10
00:00:46,359 --> 00:00:52,759
you. You were all I could be.

11
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:57,238
Now I'm here wearing

12
00:00:52,759 --> 00:01:01,718
alone. We were one. Now I'm a

13
00:00:57,238 --> 00:01:05,239
ghost falling from my place in the

14
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:08,200
sun. This dizzy is out of

15
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:11,640
control. The world keeps

16
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:15,320
spinning. I heard a vibrating

17
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:19,359
echo. Sounded a lot like

18
00:01:15,319 --> 00:01:22,039
you amongst the truths I saw.

19
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:25,799
You were the one that I

20
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:31,159
found. Now I'm needing the remembering

21
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:34,920
close of memories of you holding my

22
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:38,520
hand. Remembrances of laughter

23
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:42,478
singing. Songing the nights with

24
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:43,879
belongings. Sweetnessing the shelter of

25
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:45,798
each

26
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:47,798
other.

27
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:52,350
Reality. The

28
00:01:47,799 --> 00:02:10,849
reality of safe feeling.

30
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:35,400
With all these times of missing

31
00:02:29,318 --> 00:02:35,399
you, I'm never not going to love you.

32
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:42,519
these days without you to hold my

33
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:47,759
hand. Feeling crazier than

34
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:52,400
hell. This crazy goes on and on.

35
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:54,120
And this confusion of me, crazy together

36
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,920
or crazy

37
00:02:54,120 --> 00:03:00,920
apart. When crazy is

38
00:02:56,919 --> 00:03:02,598
crazy, it's not always in our

39
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:07,199
heads.

40
00:03:02,598 --> 00:03:07,199
Sometimes it's in our hearts.

hands and got you on my mind.

45
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:39,809
and got nowhere

46
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:49,780
else to
