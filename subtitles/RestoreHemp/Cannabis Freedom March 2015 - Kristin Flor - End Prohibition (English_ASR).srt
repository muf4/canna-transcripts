1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,760
we are a group that believes that nobody

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:05,120
should go to prison or die for our plant

3
00:00:03,759 --> 00:00:07,519
first time you guys met me was about

4
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,199
three years ago i came to you guys in a

5
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:11,119
lot of pain over my father that the

6
00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:13,039
federal government killed now three

7
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:14,320
years later i'm fighting for all the

8
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:17,118
prisoners and the defendants that he

9
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:19,278
left behind and i'm not going to give up

10
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:22,240
and i know that this this whole

11
00:00:19,278 --> 00:00:23,518
march is based around freedom so i

12
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:24,479
thought that

13
00:00:23,518 --> 00:00:26,879
because

14
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,880
we all have freedom right now

15
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:31,038
and some of us don't realize how sacred

16
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:33,200
that freedom is i know we've just

17
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:35,760
implemented a lot of laws

18
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,680
that can take away all of our freedom

19
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:39,759
okay so if we look on whose stage with

20
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:42,238
me we got martin nickerson here him and

21
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:46,159
his two co-defendants

22
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:48,479
they're facing 30 years in prison

23
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:50,878
okay we also got behind us we got

24
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:53,119
michelle and roland greg

25
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:54,799
who just because of jury nullification

26
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:56,718
that's your power to say not guilty if

27
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:58,399
you think the laws are bad

28
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,320
because of that they just

29
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:03,520
they're almost to a point where maybe

30
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,438
they don't have to go to jail for a plan

31
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:08,000
but there's some things that just not

32
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:10,000
all of us can do but everybody in our

33
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,118
community one you can go to court

34
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,840
support

35
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:16,079
you can do outreach for our prisoners

36
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,000
because even though we're here right now

37
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:19,679
there's about 50 people that will never

38
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,560
get to be here because they've been sent

39
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,520
to life in prison for our plant

40
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,840
all right

41
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:27,679
now we've got all these laws that are in

42
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,680
place right now that says

43
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,759
that if we violate them if we share

44
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,680
medicine if we do things like that we

45
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,439
can go to jail and i noticed one thing

46
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,520
here today that is not here over the

47
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:39,679
last couple years and that's all these

48
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:41,359
police out here trying to catch us doing

49
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,040
that

50
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:44,640
so if we

51
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,520
know that nobody should go to jail for a

52
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,359
plant

53
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:49,280
and we stand up and we get in trouble

54
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:51,519
because i know some of our caregivers

55
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,519
are not going to stop curing cancer

56
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:55,438
they're not going to stop medicating

57
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:57,280
they're not going to stop some of them

58
00:01:55,438 --> 00:01:58,398
and some of us might break the laws out

59
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,840
there

60
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,000
so if we know that nobody should go to

61
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,759
jail for a plant we stand up in the

62
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,078
courtrooms and we educate each other

63
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:07,759
about our right to stay not guilty

64
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:10,318
we can fight these laws that could

65
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:12,560
possibly turn us into prisoners

66
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:14,159
so soon the human solution and we're

67
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,878
asking a lot of groups out there to join

68
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:16,878
us

69
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:18,479
are going to ask for some letters for

70
00:02:16,878 --> 00:02:20,719
the kettle falls five

71
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:22,318
and and for martin nickerson

72
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:23,439
we also have debbie and josh out there i

73
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:24,719
don't know if you guys know that but

74
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:26,560
there are caregivers as well they're

75
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:28,080
just not here today but they just got

76
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,598
federally indicted

77
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,959
so while we have these state laws we

78
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:32,719
still have federal laws that says it's

79
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,878
extremely illegal

80
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:36,479
so we all need to band together and get

81
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:39,120
get united so i'm going to urge

82
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:41,359
everybody to go to our facebook our

83
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,400

85
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,080
ths intl

86
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:47,679
right now the human solution has just

87
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,080
implemented a lot of structure and a lot

88
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,159
of policies we have a media team we have

89
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,319

90
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:55,598
have one of our members tony here

93
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,440
international we just started a chapter

94
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:03,839
in kenya because even in kenya nobody

95
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:05,919
deserves to go to jail or die for our

96
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,479
so you guys please check out our website

97
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:10,238
and talk to these defendants and

98
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:12,639
know that their sacrifices that they

99
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,800
that they've made are for all of us so

100
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:17,919
treat them like the heroes that they are

101
