1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,209
you know I think of him cannabis

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:09,900
marijuana is the most important plant in

3
00:00:06,209 --> 00:00:13,320
the world and when we are able to

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:16,230
restore him without regard to its THC

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:18,960
content but according to the varieties

6
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:22,649
that make the best seed for fuel and

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:26,368
fiber and food the best stems and stocks

8
00:00:22,649 --> 00:00:29,969
for paper building materials canvas row

9
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:33,320
place in linen and the best buds for

10
00:00:29,969 --> 00:00:36,450
medicine we grow that all it's one crop

11
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:38,789
we will replace petroleum and change the

12
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:41,640
whole economic and environmental

13
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:44,488
paradigm and it's going to happen folks

14
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:47,329
it is going to happen we're going to

15
00:00:44,488 --> 00:00:50,459
replace petroleum with hip seed oil

16
00:00:47,329 --> 00:00:55,829
according to a study of wild hip here in

17
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:58,070
the United States back in 1975 done at

18
00:00:55,829 --> 00:01:00,239
University of Illinois at Urbana

19
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:03,299
published in the American Midlands

20
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:07,649
naturalist from Notre Dame one acre of

21
00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:12,269
hemp will make over 8000 pounds of hip

22
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:15,180
see now that's about 15 times more than

23
00:01:12,269 --> 00:01:18,179
the low THC varieties that they allow to

24
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:19,890
be cultivated in Canada and that they're

25
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:23,220
starting to allow here in the United

26
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:25,920
States so when we remove those [ __ ]

27
00:01:23,219 --> 00:01:29,489
restrictions and allow farmers to grow

28
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:32,759
hip for fuel without regard to its THC

29
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:36,328
content instead of poisoning the earth

30
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:39,239
with petrochemicals will be reviving the

31
00:01:36,328 --> 00:01:41,849
earth instead of taking energy out of

32
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:43,769
the natural cycle will be putting energy

33
00:01:41,849 --> 00:01:46,140
back in it will be creating food as a

34
00:01:43,769 --> 00:01:48,118
by-product and fiber is a byproduct so

35
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:51,180
we won't have to be for state this

36
00:01:48,118 --> 00:01:53,609
planet anymore you know cotton alone

37
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:56,840
takes about fifty percent of all the

38
00:01:53,609 --> 00:02:02,310
world's pesticides yep doesn't take any

39
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:04,130
so I urge you to go to him org you can

40
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:06,359
find out a little bit more about that

41
00:02:04,129 --> 00:02:08,068
another one of the things I do is I've

42
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:09,149
been blessed to be able to help medical

43
00:02:08,068 --> 00:02:13,259
marijuana patient

44
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:15,598
in a really bad law passed this year for

45
00:02:13,259 --> 00:02:19,039
medical marijuana patients and it was

46
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:22,709
signed into law it's Senate bill 50 52

47
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:25,078
we need to lobby the legislature and

48
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:27,269
stop that from being fully implemented

49
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:30,390
it's already starting to be implemented

50
00:02:27,269 --> 00:02:33,329
so I have doctors then help patients get

51
00:02:30,389 --> 00:02:37,139
their medical marijuana permits @ t HC f

52
00:02:33,329 --> 00:02:39,930
medical clinics and we are not going to

53
00:02:37,139 --> 00:02:42,059
completely comply with those lawns we're

54
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:45,060
challenging the law and we're continuing

55
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:48,090
to help patients all over the state over

56
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:50,189
the past 10 years we've been able to get

57
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:53,819
over a hundred thousand Washington

58
00:02:50,189 --> 00:02:56,908
residents become legal medical marijuana

59
00:02:53,818 --> 00:03:00,568
patients so they can possess using grow

60
00:02:56,908 --> 00:03:03,449
marijuana and we're not going to go away

61
00:03:00,568 --> 00:03:06,479
you know patients need to be able to

62
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:09,030
grow it but every person should be able

63
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:10,969
to grow this plant so there's an

64
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:14,969
initiative out there right now

65
00:03:10,969 --> 00:03:17,729
initiative 739 we have it in our tables

66
00:03:14,969 --> 00:03:19,739
at the THC up medical clinic down by the

67
00:03:17,729 --> 00:03:22,798
main stage we have another booth up by

68
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:25,830
Sealy stage we need to get signatures to

69
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:28,770
put that on the ballot for a vote

70
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:30,150
so we urge you to go out there and sign

71
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:33,510
these petitions because that's the way

72
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:37,469
we change this is we have to stand up

73
00:03:33,509 --> 00:03:40,829
and remain politically active you know

74
00:03:37,469 --> 00:03:44,490
this thing can continue to provide jobs

75
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:47,640
for people but change the whole energy

76
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:50,460
paradigm and the economic paradigm if we

77
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:53,549
can replace petroleum instead of having

78
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:56,460
our money go to Exxon and ball ball and

79
00:03:53,550 --> 00:04:00,480
the Saudi sheiks and Nigerian desp its

80
00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:02,760
it'll go to our farmers and our farmers

81
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:04,739
will spend it in our own communities you

82
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:08,009
know the whole reason marijuana was

83
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:10,920
criminalized was to stop its use as a

84
00:04:08,009 --> 00:04:13,039
fuel it was really the petrochemical

85
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:15,479
pharmaceutical military-industrial

86
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:18,000
transnational corporate elite pass the

87
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:21,269
sons of a [ __ ] who invented the

88
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,579
marijuana myth and it's only if we

89
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:26,639
continue to stand up and tell the truth

90
00:04:23,579 --> 00:04:29,969
to power that we can restore him and

91
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:33,418
save our environment and put food on our

92
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:34,800
table for energy to go up there sign the

93
00:04:33,418 --> 00:04:37,439
petition we all should be able to grow

94
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:40,168
this until marijuana is cheap and

95
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:46,168
plentiful and we can use hip for energy

96
00:04:40,168 --> 00:04:49,168
again we will not stop in closing I just

97
00:04:46,168 --> 00:04:51,839
want to say you know this stage has been

98
00:04:49,168 --> 00:04:55,529
dedicated to Peter McWilliams for a long

99
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:58,889
time he was a great activist there's

100
00:04:55,529 --> 00:05:02,339
another fellow Kevin black who has been

101
00:04:58,889 --> 00:05:05,039
a best security volunteer for a long

102
00:05:02,339 --> 00:05:08,339
time there are a lot of people that have

103
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:11,250
passed carrying this torch to end

104
00:05:08,339 --> 00:05:13,469
marijuana prohibition I urge you to go

105
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:18,000
out there and do your duty and carry it

106
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:22,569
further thank you again thank the

107
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,869
Seattle hip fest and restore him

108
00:05:22,569 --> 00:05:24,869
alright
