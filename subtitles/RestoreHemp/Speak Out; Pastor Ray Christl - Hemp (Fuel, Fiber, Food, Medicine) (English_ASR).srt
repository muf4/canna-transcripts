1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:06,359
Industrial Hemp is a strategic food and

2
00:00:03,879 --> 00:00:10,718
resource for fiber which you can make

3
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:12,798
clothing canvas paper and also that

4
00:00:10,718 --> 00:00:16,160
cellulose can be used to make the new

5
00:00:12,798 --> 00:00:18,640
substance in 1936 that Dupont wanted it

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,759
to just be made out of coal or out of

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:24,320
oil you can use the same byproduct you

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,400
can use the same uh product of cellulose

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,560
in the stock of the sensia in other

10
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:30,118
words we could be growing medical

11
00:00:27,559 --> 00:00:33,159
marijuana and take the stock of it and

12
00:00:30,118 --> 00:00:36,159
make plastic to build homes for

13
00:00:33,159 --> 00:00:38,199
Hawaiians at very inexpensive rates or

14
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:39,959
we could build an automobile I could

15
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:42,000
show you a picture real quickly here on

16
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,000
page 50 of a car that Henry Ford made

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,920
out of cannabis I know it's hard for

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,320
people to believe it but here's a car

19
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,640
made out of cannabis that not only did

20
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,878
Henry Ford want the car to be made out

21
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:56,878
of plastic made from hemp but he wanted

22
00:00:53,878 --> 00:00:58,479
it to be run in other words the fuel

23
00:00:56,878 --> 00:01:01,679
there was a process where you could

24
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:03,319
renewably take plants especially hemp

25
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:05,359
and after you take the seeds off for the

26
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:08,118
food to feed starving people or to feed

27
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:10,879
animals or to press that oil into the

28
00:01:08,118 --> 00:01:13,478
lubricating uh lubricants for the grease

29
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:14,519
and the oil in the car so literally we

30
00:01:13,478 --> 00:01:17,599
can use

31
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:20,078
plants natural resources given to us by

32
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:20,919
God our creator to solve problems here

33
00:01:20,078 --> 00:01:24,919
in

34
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:27,560
Maui now the National Review which is

35
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:30,040
the uh publication of the conservative

36
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:32,399
right and William F Buckley who is a

37
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:34,280
scholar has come out recently this is

38
00:01:32,399 --> 00:01:37,239
the second front page in a year where he

39
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:40,680
said yeah it's p people uh the drug the

40
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:44,280
War on Drugs is the War on Drugs really

41
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:47,040
lost and he gives 17 scholarly points in

42
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:49,118
this magazine where he feels that the

43
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,439
way to go is harm reduction and

44
00:01:49,118 --> 00:01:55,959
immediate relaxation of laws against

45
00:01:51,438 --> 00:01:55,959
cannabis for even recreational use
