00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:38,530
here at the buyers club cooking leaf

22
00:01:36,609 --> 00:01:40,390
this is so this way you can cook these

23
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:43,868
things at home for yourself and be able

24
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:50,170
to make your own pink shirt it's

25
00:01:43,868 --> 00:01:53,650
marijuana make blended in and you just

26
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:56,490
take a few drops of that we also have

27
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:58,719
marijuana that you can spot on the side

28
00:01:56,489 --> 00:02:01,419
depending upon the quality of it

29
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:04,569
determines the price so of course this

30
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:08,110
being the most potent this would be the

31
00:02:04,569 --> 00:02:11,560
most this is the most expensive one with

37
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:34,750
little bit about the buyers club and how

38
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:36,430
it came into being my best friend my

39
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:39,939
water brother of 14 years

40
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:42,580
Jonathan West had AIDS Jonathan was

41
00:02:39,939 --> 00:02:45,129
taken a myriad of drugs like every AIDS

42
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:48,130
patient and all those drugs had severe

43
00:02:45,129 --> 00:02:50,349
side effects from constant nausea to

44
00:02:48,129 --> 00:02:55,539
appetite suppressant and to making you

45
00:02:50,349 --> 00:02:58,750
feeling really bad the one drug that was

46
00:02:55,539 --> 00:03:00,789
really helping Jonathan was marijuana it

47
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:03,009
was the one drug that allowed him to

48
00:03:00,789 --> 00:03:05,889
ease his nausea to stimulate his

49
00:03:03,009 --> 00:03:08,739
appetite yes and it was one drug that

50
00:03:05,889 --> 00:03:11,579
made him feel a little bit better when

51
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:14,290
Jonathan died me and my friends collect

52
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:16,800
16,000 signatures to put a medical

53

marijuana initiative on the ballot and

54
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:23,439
the people of San Francisco responded by

55
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:25,180
80% to legalize marijuana as medicine to

56

00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:34,810
ordered the district attorney and the

60
00:03:33,099 --> 00:03:37,689
Chief of Police to place the marijuana

61
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:41,800
enforcement laws for medical purposes as

to be the lowest priority marijuana

63
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:49,689
although it is illegal helps people I'm

64
00:03:46,629 --> 00:03:52,539
working to legalize it for these people

65
00:03:49,689 --> 00:03:54,310
and one only has to spend one day at the

66
00:03:52,539 --> 00:03:58,889
buyers club to know that this is a

67
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:58,890
medicine that works for a lot of people

68
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:07,009
I'm 75 now

69
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:08,300
I didn't used to smoke irregularly I

70
00:04:07,009 --> 00:04:11,389
just things have been they were around

71
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:15,560
or celebrated you know I was diagnosed

72
00:04:11,389 --> 00:04:18,979
with glaucoma a year ago April and I've

73
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:25,040
been told for years that was helped the

74
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:26,930
pressure for my blindness off but I went

75
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,480
by ophthalmologists expecting him to be

76
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:32,120
able to ride up out of prescription and

77
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:33,379
I found out that it was illegal I hadn't

78
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,209
paid a lot of much attention to him

79
00:04:33,379 --> 00:04:37,279
before you know I started a nutri sale

80
00:04:35,209 --> 00:04:39,289
deal anyway then I started writing

81
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:43,879
letters to officials and one saying

82
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:45,830
another real letter to Angela Alioto who

83
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:49,250
is the president of San Francisco for

84
00:04:45,829 --> 00:04:51,529
supervisors and I told her why had heard

85
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:53,899
that her husband who had had cancer and

86
00:04:51,529 --> 00:04:59,899
the Jews never wanted to help him

87
00:04:53,899 --> 00:05:02,149
through his death and anyway she I wrote

88
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:04,250
her letter but it was on my mind and she

89
00:05:02,149 --> 00:05:06,979
wrote me back told me he called Dennis

90
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:08,939
never even heard this before and this

91
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:10,999
was it maybe in last January

92
00:05:08,939 --> 00:05:13,249
[Music]

93
00:05:10,999 --> 00:05:18,799
so I called him and Dennis invited me

94
00:05:13,249 --> 00:05:21,499
open and having glaucoma is uh and in

95
00:05:18,798 --> 00:05:26,838
for me you know we all we all who are

96
00:05:21,499 --> 00:05:29,689

100
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:43,429
anything in marijuana is good for if you

101
00:05:40,968 --> 00:05:46,728
have the anorexia the marijuana would

102
00:05:43,428 --> 00:05:49,298
work and for P management marijuana

103
00:05:46,728 --> 00:05:54,188
works and if you're extremely depressed

104
00:05:49,298 --> 00:05:54,188
instead of Prozac marijuana does work

00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:11,439
different reasons I can get bought

116

better quality consistently and cheaper

117
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:17,348
here than I can on the street which is

118
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,340
but in terms of medical reason is the

119
00:07:17,348 --> 00:07:19,779
fact that I've got something called

120
00:07:18,339 --> 00:07:21,429
drusen to the optic nerve is basically

121
00:07:19,779 --> 00:07:28,839
sort of a wart like expressing sits on

122
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:31,810
my high memory and it what it does it it

123
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:32,978
is decreasing my field of vision as well

124
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:35,168
as increasing the pressure in my eyes

125
00:07:32,978 --> 00:07:36,939
and also produces a lack of binocular

126
00:07:35,168 --> 00:07:38,319
focus when I smoke pot helps reduce

127
00:07:36,939 --> 00:07:40,240
pressure and brings back my do not go

128
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,699
focus so I can see someone still can't

129
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,840
see completely but I can see a lot

130
00:07:42,699 --> 00:07:46,560
better after I'm supposed to join the

human beings to get high to remove

136
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,120
themselves temporarily out of an

[Music]

145
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:47,350
it's hard to believe that seven or eight

146
00:08:44,778 --> 00:08:53,389
years ago I was able to ride my bicycle

147
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:57,310
from here to Santa Cruz this place is

148
00:08:53,389 --> 00:08:59,659
really great to marijuana from because

149
00:08:57,309 --> 00:09:02,149
for one thing you don't have to take

150
00:08:59,659 --> 00:09:06,189
your chances out on the street like the

151
00:09:02,149 --> 00:09:09,078
going to Dolores Park for example we're

152
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:13,430
never quite sure what quality you're

153
00:09:09,078 --> 00:09:19,429
getting or if you're going to be robbed

154
00:09:13,429 --> 00:09:21,739
or it's just dangerous this is this is a

155
00:09:19,429 --> 00:09:25,429
safe place

156
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:27,500
I think it makes a lot of sense reality

157
00:09:25,429 --> 00:09:29,870
is the medical marijuana clubs have

158
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:32,509
operated without interference from local

159
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:35,389
police or federal drug agents our

160
00:09:32,509 --> 00:09:37,759
manpower doesn't permit to really

161
00:09:35,389 --> 00:09:39,259
operate at the street level so it is a

162
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:45,950
low priority right now

163
00:09:39,259 --> 00:09:49,460
yes it would be program are very sincere

164
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:51,890
and they're trying to do something to

165
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:56,590
alleviate their pain versus other

166
00:09:51,889 --> 00:10:00,080
methods I think it's something that the

167
00:09:56,590 --> 00:10:02,899
the the the justice system has not

168
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,340
responded to that particular social need

169

could have been here they couldn't get

00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:35,410
anybody in this and so I was baking at a

00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:38,410
safe house I was baking for about 20 or

178

could get enough belief donated I would

180
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:46,389
make this videos I could delete that was

181
00:10:43,779 --> 00:10:49,720
donated and I was in the room two kids

Poorna legs or income and they were

190
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:13,379
baking that day and they got me to and

191
00:11:11,889 --> 00:11:15,989
thought they he

192
00:11:13,379 --> 00:11:18,899
they said guess what we've got here

00:11:15,989 --> 00:11:22,519
brownie marry and they thought that was

194

a big deal however really backfired up

leafless is some pitches suitable and in

00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:53,160
any kind of oil or butter and there's

218
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:55,690
another way of using alcohol and

increasing the potency which I'm which

I'm just like experimenting worse

00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:02,620
so five just like used my leaf and in

222
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:06,029
the crock pot was butter let it soak

223
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:09,149
overnight and then get magnificent

statement on there yet

228
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:25,690
the can I say it was really good and I'm

229
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:27,278
gonna have one and basically I'm

230
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:30,160
actually only gonna have half of it

231
00:13:27,278 --> 00:13:36,330
because a hole would make me feel sleepy

232
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:36,329
to sleep and I'd rather do at home

233

the whole thing at home

these aren't Mary's brownies these are

00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:50,740
somebody else makes these if if I get a

chance to get one of Mary's brownies

know gives me that right away freely but

00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:05,829
this actually takes an hour and a half

00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:07,200
or so to really start to feel it I have

243

me to alleviate the pain born after

244
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:18,039
surgery are toxic and marijuana isn't so

245

from my surgery I couldn't even move

it's some people say that Mexican is

harsher to smoke that the taste is to

262
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:37,000
keep your buzz and a lot of people are

263
00:15:35,139 --> 00:15:39,580
not able to smoke it because of their

264
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:43,019
lungs because of respiratory systems and

265
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:46,270
parts what have you and smoking is bad

266
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:51,789
so eating it really is becoming more and

267
00:15:46,269 --> 00:15:53,620
more popular every like these actually

268
00:15:51,789 --> 00:15:56,019
really caught on these rice krispies you

269
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:58,500
know these really caught on it's somehow

270
00:15:56,019 --> 00:16:02,730
a taste right the taste of marijuana is

271
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:06,208
odd it doesn't go with everything

272
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:10,499
nothing tops home made

273
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:12,868
and like this this is an ounce of

274
00:16:10,499 --> 00:16:15,360
marijuana and it's the shake and the

275
00:16:12,869 --> 00:16:18,420
leaf from the flowers that that this is

276
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:21,149
but this is enough we sell this for what

277
00:16:18,419 --> 00:16:24,149
15 dollars enough pots to make a batch

278
00:16:21,149 --> 00:16:25,919
of brownies about 12 doses homemade is

279
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:28,409
really good because when you first take

280
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:30,498
it out of the oven and it's hot it is

281
00:16:28,409 --> 00:16:33,078
heated and it's like it's like slightly

out you meet one of those brownies way

mostly if I'm going to eat it I probably

287
00:16:45,589 --> 00:16:50,179
would eat it in a cookie form usually

288
00:16:47,269 --> 00:16:52,369
browning or sometimes I might make

little bit of help I've seen definite

335
00:19:58,179 --> 00:20:03,970
improvement I've experienced this myself

336
00:20:01,259 --> 00:20:10,710
I've just seen a lot of miracles a lot

337
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:14,288
of miracles here they can get dirty wood

338
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:18,769
very sick people searching their parks

339
00:20:14,288 --> 00:20:21,769
for marijuana I think is 3100 people

340
00:20:18,769 --> 00:20:23,480
these people are as in boredom in the

341
00:20:21,769 --> 00:20:26,720
winter of their life

342
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:27,259
Nate sir every respect excited to give

343
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,039
them

344
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:33,069
I may have to pay price um

345
00:20:30,039 --> 00:20:36,450
but in prison what I'm doing but I

346
00:20:33,069 --> 00:20:36,450
believe what I'm doing

347
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:40,160
what just has to be here one day you

348
00:20:39,569 --> 00:20:43,179

we're doing right thing we are helping

350
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:48,529
the crisis time of them

351
00:20:46,519 --> 00:20:53,019
you could say this club is that

352
00:20:48,529 --> 00:20:53,019
marijuana but it is really about love

354

Californians for compassionate use we

355
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:21,800
feel calls from all over America every

356
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,630
day we get pause from people out there

357
00:21:21,799 --> 00:21:25,490
that want information on this topic and

358
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:28,100
we've been trying in our own humble

359
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:30,799
little way to influence national policy

360
00:21:28,099 --> 00:21:35,389
in this area as best we as a citizen

361
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:37,069
activist group can do it was passed by

362
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:39,920
both houses in the California State

363
00:21:37,069 --> 00:21:41,779
Legislature by a nice margin it was a

364
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:45,680
bipartisan vote Republicans in both

365
00:21:41,779 --> 00:21:47,839
houses passed this bill and we lobbied

366
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:50,360
for this bill I had the honor of going

367
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:52,159
out there with NS on numerous occasions

368
00:21:50,359 --> 00:21:54,199
and watching some of the patients also

369
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:56,269
go out there and testify for the bill

370
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:57,769
and that was quite a process

371
00:21:56,269 --> 00:22:00,920
I mean Dennis actually and some of the

372
00:21:57,769 --> 00:22:03,230
patients went door to door legislature

373
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:05,029
to legislatures and it was quite a thing

374
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:06,890
to see because Dennis is a master and

375
00:22:05,029 --> 00:22:08,269
this was something I would step back in

376
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:10,340
generally watch he really had to see

377
00:22:08,269 --> 00:22:12,379
this to understand that the power of

378
00:22:10,339 --> 00:22:15,609
speech because it was his voice would go

379
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:17,360
up and the infectiousness of his

380
00:22:15,609 --> 00:22:19,069
characteristic of what he was explaining

381
00:22:17,359 --> 00:22:20,689
would go up into and these offices

382
00:22:19,069 --> 00:22:22,909
aren't that big usually you've got

383
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:24,610
another legislator in the backroom is

384
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:26,570
letting you know you've got Dennis

385
00:22:24,609 --> 00:22:28,250
talking directly and discourse

386
00:22:26,569 --> 00:22:31,069
incorrectly with these legislators

387
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:33,559
without you know just just pure pure on

388
00:22:31,069 --> 00:22:35,240
its own merits and really really swaying

389
00:22:33,559 --> 00:22:39,470
them with the conviction of argument it

390
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:41,450
was really something to see we didn't

391
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:43,759
personally get to see the governor and

392
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:45,680
we brought 30 patients by and we

393
00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:47,779
presented the governor Dennis presented

394
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:50,070
the governor through his office with a

395
00:22:47,779 --> 00:22:52,980

okay for a sick person to grow a couple

451
00:25:51,519 --> 00:26:14,319
I started selling marijuana in 1970 and

452
00:26:12,039 --> 00:26:20,639
I paid a dear price for it including

453
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:23,529
getting arrested child huge jury trials

454
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:27,880
1977 again I was arrested for running

455
00:26:23,529 --> 00:26:29,639
the big Top Pot supermarket it was kind

456
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:32,860
of the one-stop shopping

457
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:36,820
three scales no waiting treated like a

458
00:26:32,859 --> 00:26:39,969
king and my friend Harvey Milk and I

459
00:26:36,819 --> 00:26:46,029
conspired to legalize marijuana on the

460
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:51,549
1978 ballot by Proposition W we won that

461
00:26:46,029 --> 00:26:55,089
vote by 58% at Harvey Milk in in a note

462
00:26:51,549 --> 00:26:57,819
to my jail cell told me he was going to

463
00:26:55,089 --> 00:27:00,519
see that it was enforced and that mo no

464
00:26:57,819 --> 00:27:03,429
city funds were gonna be allocated to

465
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:05,799
enforce the marijuana laws but that

466
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:08,310
wasn't a P because Harvey Milk was

467
00:27:05,799 --> 00:27:10,930
gunned down by an assassin's bullet and

468
00:27:08,309 --> 00:27:14,950
it also put a bullet through the

469
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:18,820
marijuana movements heart because see

470
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:24,190
Harvey was our spokesman moving on to my

471
00:27:18,819 --> 00:27:27,189
wall this is a poster of when I ran for

472
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:29,160
charter commissioner I ran for charter

473
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:31,120
commissioner when I was in jail for

474
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:34,060
selling marijuana from the pot

475
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:38,019
supermarket and Harvey Milk endorsed me

476
00:27:34,059 --> 00:27:40,710
for that race I unfortunately lost but

477
00:27:38,019 --> 00:27:44,079
not by much and not before Dan white

478
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:46,750
denounced me and Harvey Milk in front of

479
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:49,019
the board supervisors the same time I

480
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:51,460
had proposition W on the ballot I

481
00:27:49,019 --> 00:27:53,410
unfortunately was in jail for that we

482
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:56,200
have elections so I did see my

483
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:59,410
initiative win by 58% and myself come

484
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:02,319
within 1500 votes of actually winning a

485
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:04,269
seat on the Charter Commissioner and now

486
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:06,700
my restaurant and they

487
00:28:04,269 --> 00:28:09,308
the island restaurant it was in the

488
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:12,338
heart of the Castro district in Harvey

489
00:28:09,308 --> 00:28:15,509
Milk's headquarters for 75 and 76

490
00:28:12,338 --> 00:28:19,868

491
00:28:15,509 --> 00:28:22,659
his campaign headquarters for that race

492
00:28:19,868 --> 00:28:24,728
and he didn't win that race but that was

493
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:28,539
not to be because he was meant he was

494
00:28:24,729 --> 00:28:30,700
meant to win the race in 1977 we became

495
00:28:28,538 --> 00:28:33,278
the first openly gay like the supervisor

496
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:37,328
and let elected official in the whole

of hope and compassion
