1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:05,919
I am a travel

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:09,400
writer and for me high is a

3
00:00:05,918 --> 00:00:12,678
place it's a beautiful place it's a

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:15,278
place where my speakers sound better

5
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:18,359
it's a place where suddenly I'm a good

6
00:00:15,278 --> 00:00:20,600
cook where conversations Slither around

7
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:22,720
like stray cats and then once in a while

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:25,840
I like to go there and a lot of people

9
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:28,759
do now there are cases when our

10
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:30,518
government can say we can't go someplace

11
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,800
but if they say we can't go there there

12
00:00:30,518 --> 00:00:35,159
better be a good reason and as far as

13
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:37,119
I'm concerned there's no good reason for

14
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:40,759
our government to tell us we cannot go

15
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:43,439
to that beautiful place right today

16
00:00:40,759 --> 00:00:46,159
80,000 Americans are in jail because

17
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:49,119
they wanted to go to that place called

18
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:52,358
high I believe that the responsible

19
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:54,919
adult recreational use of marijuana is a

20
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:54,920
civil

21
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:03,399
liberty I'm not promoting marijuana it's

22
00:01:00,439 --> 00:01:05,518
a drug it's not healthy it can be abused

23
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:07,840
it can be addictive it's certainly not

24
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,759
for kids and if you're caught driving

25
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,719
Intoxicated by anything as far as I'm

26
00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:14,640
concerned they should throw the book at

27
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:18,438
you but that doesn't deny the basic

28
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:20,960
principle that enjoying marijuana is a

29
00:01:18,438 --> 00:01:23,478
civil

30
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:27,319
liberty now our government is waging a

31
00:01:23,478 --> 00:01:29,679
war a long losing expensive demoralizing

32
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:32,719
war against marijuana based on fears and

33
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:35,880
lies Li it's demoralizing our police

34
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:38,158
force it's eroding and corroding

35
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:40,319
necessary credibility among parents and

36
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,439
teachers to teach their children how to

37
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:44,798
get through the threats of hard drug

38
00:01:42,438 --> 00:01:47,199
abuse in their young years it's wasting

39
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:50,079
billions of dollars and it's messing up

40
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,520
literally hundreds of thousands of lives

41
00:01:50,078 --> 00:01:55,000
800,000 Americans were arrested last

42
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:57,199
year for marijuana they're not rich

43
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,159
white guys they're poor people and

44
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,520
people of color and people who cannot go

45
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:04,280
through life with bad burden this is a

46
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:07,078
Scourge on our society and it's time

47
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:09,159
that we have a new approach now I inject

48
00:02:07,078 --> 00:02:10,959
a European perspective to this and in

49
00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:14,079
Europe a joint is about as exciting as a

50
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:16,039
can of beer Europe has its drug abuse

51
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,800
problems we have our drug abuse problems

52
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:19,719
but in Europe they measure the

53
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:21,920
effectiveness of their drug policies not

54
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:25,400
by how many people do you lock up but by

55
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:28,159
a concept called harm reduction how do

56
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:30,959
you minimize harm that this drug causes

57
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:33,439
to a society and they found that if you

58
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:35,159
take the crime out of the equation take

59
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:37,079
the violence take the money out of the

60
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:39,878
equation then it becomes a health

61
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:42,400
concern and an education challenge my

62
00:02:39,878 --> 00:02:44,799
friends in Europe constantly remind me

63
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:47,319
that a society has to make a choice

64
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:50,400
tolerate alternative Lifestyles or build

65
00:02:47,318 --> 00:02:53,000
more prisons here in the United States

66
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,920
we've decided to opt for the latter and

67
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,639
my friends in Europe always follow up

68
00:02:54,919 --> 00:02:58,119
that comment by reminding me that we

69
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:00,039
here in the United States lock up more

70
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:02,439
people than anybody else in the world

71
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:04,878
[ __ ] we lock up eight times as many

72
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:06,759
people per capita as the Europeans do

73
00:03:04,878 --> 00:03:10,359
either we are inherently more criminal

74
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:10,359
or there's something messed up about our

75
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:15,479
lives now our drug policy is based on

76
00:03:13,878 --> 00:03:17,639
fear and

77
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:19,560
misinformation for how long has our

78
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:22,518
government been spending money on Reaper

79
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:24,759
Madness propaganda consequently there's

80
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:26,799
a whole bunch of people that are really

81
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:28,318
afraid there's a lot of people that

82
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:29,920
think there's a whole reservoir of

83
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:31,598
people that just they could wish they

84
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:33,679
could ruin their lives if only it was

85
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:35,438
legal well in Europe they've learned

86
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,280
that there is not that reservoir of

87
00:03:35,438 --> 00:03:39,680
people that would use marijuana if only

88
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,519
it was legal in Portugal they

89
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,840
decriminalized the consumption of all

90
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,959
drugs 10 years ago they just did a

91
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:49,000
review of that policy and you know they

92
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:51,640
like it use does not go up the crime is

93
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,360
out it becomes a little more boring and

94
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:56,279
life goes on there's a lot of Americans

95
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:58,400
that are also afraid of this gateway

96
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:01,079
drug notion one to of marijuana and

97
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,079
you're on the way to heroin addiction

98
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:04,920
well Europe has learned it's not the

99
00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:06,360
case in the Netherlands it's been 25

100
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:09,559
years since they arrested somebody for

101
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:12,239
spoken marijuana and what they found is

102
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:15,120
that there's not an increase in hard

103
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:17,519
drug use their drug taking population is

104
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,160
staying the same in numbers and it's

105
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,798
getting older in demographics because

106
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,919
people want to experiment with drugs

107
00:04:21,798 --> 00:04:25,758
which is something that kids do they do

108
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:27,279
it in their 20s and then they get over

109
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,319
it and they get back on with other kind

110
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:31,839
of things that are exciting to them and

111
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:34,079
it's just a way of life in Europe the

112
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:36,679
only thing Gateway about marijuana is

113
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:38,279
its illegality because when it's illegal

114
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:40,038
people have to buy it from criminals in

115
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:41,319
the street who have a vested interest in

116
00:04:40,038 --> 00:04:44,319
getting you hooked on something that's

117
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:46,959
more addictive and more

118
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:49,038
profitable we need to take a hard look

119
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:51,239
at our drug laws and it's so exciting to

120
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:53,279
have a celebration like this Hempfest is

121
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:55,439
a great celebration of cannabis culture

122
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:57,638
but I'll tell you if we want to legalize

123
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:59,879
this we got to mobilize we got to get

124
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:01,639
serious we got to stop preaching the the

125
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:04,199
choir and take it out to the subs where

126
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:06,680
people are afraid of this stuff we have

127
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:08,240
hardworking in uh advocacy groups I'm a

128
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:10,720
board member of normal I've been that

129
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,918
for 10 years these groups are fighting a

130
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,240
dogged and difficult campaign on each of

131
00:05:12,918 --> 00:05:16,719
our behalfs they're not Charities

132
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,879
they're services and they're doing our

133
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,120
work for us and you know there's some

134
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:25,240
initiatives going on I am so proud to be

135
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:28,199
a a co-sponsor of initiative

136
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:30,319
i502 now I know that this discourages

137
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:32,038
and disappoints a lot of ideas that want

138
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:34,360
marijuana to be completely free and

139
00:05:32,038 --> 00:05:36,839
legal but that's not going to pass in

140
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:39,240
the voting booth that would pass here

141
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:42,679
but it's not going to pass out there we

142
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:45,840
need something pragmatic as a first step

143
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:47,918
please learn about this this is a smart

144
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:50,239
law this is a law that has elected

145
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:52,758
officials behind it this is a law that's

146
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:55,680
not scary it deals headon with the

147
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:59,720
reasons Prop 19 failed and if we can

148
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:01,800
stay together we can pass this thing i50

149
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:03,960
to as a booth 100 yard right over there

150
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:06,918
you'll see it I'm over there later on

151
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:08,560
today we'd love to get volunteers to get

152
00:06:06,918 --> 00:06:10,918
out there and get signatures we got to

153
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:13,399
get 240,000 signatures to get this thing

154
00:06:10,918 --> 00:06:16,799
on the ballot and trust me once it's on

155
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:18,638
the ballot it will pass most people out

156
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,520
there want to know about driving

157
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,478
problems and they want to know about how

158
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:24,680
you going to retail and all these boring

159
00:06:22,478 --> 00:06:26,519
facts this is our first step towards

160
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:28,400
legalizing marijuana it's going to

161
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:30,598
happen in Washington and then you can

162
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:32,359
tell your grandchildren you help change

163
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:35,399
those laws that's

164
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:37,720
[Applause]

165
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:40,198
exciting now we're at a Crossroads in

166
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:41,840
our society think about the 1930s when

167
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:43,560
courageous people were stepping up about

168
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:46,000
the laws against alcohol and saying you

169
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:48,439
know this law is causing more problems

170
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,478
then it's helping and maril LaGuardia

171
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:51,759
said back in the 30s if you got a law in

172
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:53,959
the book that you don't intend to

173
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:56,560
enforce consistently across the board

174
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:59,038
the very existence of that law erodes

175
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:01,240
respect for law enforcement in general

176
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:03,279
today got along the books that is

177
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:05,478
eroding respect for law enforcement they

178
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:07,638
got no intention of enforcing it if they

179
00:07:05,478 --> 00:07:09,598
locked us all up tomorrow would be one

180
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:12,800
less interesting less creative place to

181
00:07:09,598 --> 00:07:16,839
BU to call home wouldn't it oh

182
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:19,918
yeah I want you to know that I'm a

183
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:22,638
hardworking kid raising churchgoing

184
00:07:19,918 --> 00:07:24,198
taxpaying citizen of the United States

185
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,400
and if I work all day and want to go

186
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:29,400
home and smoke a joint that's my civil

187
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:29,399
liberty

188
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:34,478
if you agree with that get with us make

189
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:36,839
a difference we've got a window with

190
00:07:34,478 --> 00:07:39,318
i502 all right and then we can get

191
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:41,638
Beyond hard on drugs and soft on drugs

192
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:44,199
and as a society we can be smart on

193
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:46,120
drugs all right thank you very much

194
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:50,120
Happy travels even if you're just

195
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:50,120
