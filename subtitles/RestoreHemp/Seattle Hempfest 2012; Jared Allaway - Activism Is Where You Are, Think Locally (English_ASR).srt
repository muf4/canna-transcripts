1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,639
hi I was just over at the imposium stage

2
00:00:02,158 --> 00:00:05,519
uh doing a panel with some other

3
00:00:03,638 --> 00:00:06,798
cannabis activists and we're just

4
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:10,160
talking about things you can do to

5
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:14,480
become an activist and uh Ben from the

6
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:16,278
CDC mentioned that uh nor Callahan uh

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,080
says that activism is where you are and

8
00:00:16,278 --> 00:00:21,039
I I think that's really important uh you

9
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:23,639
got to think local and think simple keep

10
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:25,800
it simple this is a big

11
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:29,599
sign with

12
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:31,480
uh six words five words you know it's

13
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,200
simple

14
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:35,640
uh you have to find out something inside

15
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,239
yourself how do I help uh and the only

16
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,520
way you can do that is by taking first

17
00:00:37,238 --> 00:00:42,280
steps you you can't be afraid you have

18
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,640
to be willing to experiment and I tried

19
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:47,079
making

20
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:49,600
t-shirts and you know I wasn't very good

21
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:52,600
at first but practice makes

22
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,800
perfect so try different things

23
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:58,480
experiment find out what you're good at

24
00:00:54,799 --> 00:01:01,038
find something inside yourself that lets

25
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:03,159
you help someone other than

26
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:06,719
yourself right now I'm working with the

27
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:09,640
Cannabis child protection act uh 514 it

28
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:13,158
would allow uh adults 21 years of age

29
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:14,879
and older to grow a 20x20 Garden

30
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:18,080

31
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:20,719
require video proof of impairment before

32
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:22,400
