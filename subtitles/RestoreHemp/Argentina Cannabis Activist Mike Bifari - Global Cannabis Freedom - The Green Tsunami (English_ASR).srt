1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:07,799
we had about 200,000 people in the March

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:10,839
uh asking for marijuana Liberation and

3
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:13,599
um uh people completely lost their fear

4
00:00:10,839 --> 00:00:16,480
for law enforcement they're kind of in a

5
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:20,000
complete uh Civil disob Disobedience

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:21,920
concerning planting the seeds so we're

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,198
you know things are also happening there

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:27,279
in Argentina the government is also

9
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:29,320
announced that they are looking to urai

10
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:32,000
as an example so they are very

11
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:34,439
respectful about the euroian government

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,320
what they did this year that was

13
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:39,959
legalizing cannabis for recreational

14
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:43,320
purposes and sales over the over the

15
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:45,600
counter and distribution and production

16
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,799
so this is happening in this small tiny

17
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,039
country called urugai which is

18
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:53,759
surrounded by two big monsters which is

19
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:56,160
Brazil and Argentina and we hope that

20
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:58,839
the impact that Colorado and Washington

21
00:00:56,159 --> 00:01:01,640
brought to South America also Euro wide

22
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:04,000
will impact their next door neighbors

23
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:06,280
and you know this green tsunami will not

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,920
stop because this is a green tsunami

25
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:11,960
that already started here in the United

26
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:14,719
States so I want to thank you all for

27
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:17,399
this big effort that all these years you

28
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:20,560
guys have done as an example for the

29
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:22,640
rest of the world this country culture

30
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:26,000
and this is what we need you know we

31
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:28,239
need some of your culture over there uh

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,799
to teach these people all the benefits

33
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:34,798
of this plant not only for using for

34
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:37,600
recreational purposes from a a harbu

35
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,680
perspective but also what it means for

36
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:43,679
industrial purposes all the jobs that

37
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:46,520
can create and how ecological it is

38
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:49,159
because cannabis is basically e

39
00:01:46,519 --> 00:01:51,640
ecological it doesn't need no chemicals

40
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:54,000
to grow you know it's it's better than

41
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:58,560
all the the Pharmaceuticals and all the

42
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:03,079
petrochemicals you all know that okay so

43
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:07,399
um uh I want to encourage you guys to go

44
00:02:03,078 --> 00:02:11,318
and vote in November for prop 91 because

45
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:14,159
as we are now uh after Colorado

46
00:02:11,318 --> 00:02:16,399
Washington South America is also uh

47
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:18,959
going forward for legalization I think

48
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,319
this is a worldwide process and you guys

49
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:24,598
can make a difference it will be a huge

50
00:02:21,318 --> 00:02:27,359
impact if you pass this law so I want to

51
00:02:24,598 --> 00:02:30,238
encourage all of you to take your

52
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,959
friends and go and vote you know to V is

53
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:36,120
very important you know in some of our

54
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:39,199
countries you know like artina and Chile

55
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:42,959
we had this mean mean milit who

56
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:45,639
kidnapped a whole generation of us and

57
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:48,120
now we're able to vote again you know

58
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:50,479
sometimes democracy is a lie but it's a

59
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:53,120
right and if we we can use it in the

60
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:56,439
correct form it will be a benefit for

61
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,439
all of us
