00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:04,679

[Music]

3
00:00:04,679 --> 00:00:07,679
rest

4
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:15,000
on stars. I'd like to lay my weary bones

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:19,600
tonight on a

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,518
bed. California stars. I'd love to feel

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:26,480
your hand touching mine. Don't tell me

8
00:00:22,518 --> 00:00:30,358
why. I must keep working on. Yes, I give

9
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:35,320
my life to lay my head tonight on a

10
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:38,359
bed of California stars. I'd love to

11
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:43,039
dream all the way on my

12
00:00:38,359 --> 00:00:47,719
bed of California stars. Jump up from my

13
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:51,519
star bed. Make another day underneath.

14
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:54,439
California stars they hang like grapes

15
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:57,520
on vines that shine and warm a lover's

16
00:00:54,439 --> 00:01:00,640
glass like friendly wine.

17
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,879
and give this world a dream a dream with

18
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:07,319
you on our

19
00:01:01,878 --> 00:01:07,319
bed of California stars.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:28,960
I have to rest a heavy head tonight on a

21
00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:32,599
bed of California stars. I'd like to lay

22
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:36,519
my weary bones tonight on my

23
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:40,359
bed of California stars. I'd love to

24
00:01:36,519 --> 00:01:45,920
feel your hand touching mine. Tell me

25
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:49,438
why I must keep working on my life to

26
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:52,759
lay my head tonight on the bed.

27
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:56,118
California stars I'd love to

28
00:01:52,759 --> 00:02:00,319
dream all the way out of

29
00:01:56,118 --> 00:02:03,799
it. California stars jump up from the

30
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:07,039
star and make another day

31
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:10,560
underneath. California stars they hang

32
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:14,159
like grapes on plants that shine and

33
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:17,598
warm a lover's glass like friendly wine.

34
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:19,318
Guess I give this world to dream a dream

35
00:02:17,598 --> 00:02:24,439
with you on our

36
00:02:19,318 --> 00:02:24,439
bed. California stars.
