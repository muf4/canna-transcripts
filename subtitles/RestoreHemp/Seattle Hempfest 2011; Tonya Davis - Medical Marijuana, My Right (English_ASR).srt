10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,599

right

18
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:46,960
um my whole life I have not been heard

19
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:50,159
when I was a little girl I couldn't

20
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,160
speak until I was

21
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:57,198
five I finally found my

22
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:59,090
voice you guys have given me the courage

23
00:00:57,198 --> 00:01:01,759
to find my voice

24
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:04,359
[Music]

25
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:07,438
I have a laundry

26
00:01:04,359 --> 00:01:09,719
list of things going on with my body but

27
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:11,279
let me first give you a little

28
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:14,000
background on

29
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,960
Tanya Tanya Davis does not have a

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,799
criminal

31
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:23,559
record Tanya Davis is not a drug

32
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:28,079
addict Tanya Davis has uh just found

33
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:31,960
out that I have massive calcium deposits

34
00:01:28,078 --> 00:01:34,399
that are on my brain two weeks ago I was

35
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:37,519
hospitalized so the laundry list don't

36
00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:40,399
even matter anymore you know I got all

37
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:42,759
past that I've learned to deal with

38
00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:46,159
that

39
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:48,478
but the mass of calcium deposits on my

40
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:51,240
brain it's not like I have cancer and I

41
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:51,239
can go have

42
00:01:52,438 --> 00:01:58,798
chemotherapy and they'll take it

43
00:01:55,118 --> 00:02:02,118
away my calcium deposits are causing

44
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:04,560
severe brain d damage and before anyone

45
00:02:02,118 --> 00:02:06,879
makes any comments no I have never done

46
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:11,000
methampetamine

47
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:13,560
um so that is not the

48
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,719
cause I just found out that causes

49
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:19,920
crystallization or something someone

50
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:21,159
made a smart ass remark so but I am not

51
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:24,359
about all

52
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:26,199
that what I am

53
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:29,440
about is

54
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:32,119
fighting for my right to use this

55
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:36,479
medicine I choose to eat

56
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:40,800
it I am a medical marijuana patient and

57
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:40,799
I choose to eat my

58
00:02:41,158 --> 00:02:47,439
medicine okay back to the calcium

59
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:51,199
deposits on my brain it's causing severe

60
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:53,680
damage and medical marijuana may be the

61
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:56,079
only thing that can save my life or give

62
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,280
my part of my brain that isn't covered

63
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:01,280
in

64
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:04,719
calcium a chance to protect

65
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:08,080
itself so I truly with all my

66
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:11,759
heart if you need a

67
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:15,000
reason to stand up for what's

68
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:18,439
right use

69
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,959
me please use

70
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:24,120
me because I believe I can be utilized

71
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:26,799
in this movement in a positive way and

72
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,840
that's honestly you know when they told

73
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,159
me

74
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,759
that I was going to speak on this

75
00:03:30,158 --> 00:03:36,318
wonderful main stage I was scared to

76
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:38,878
death but then I got to thinking in my

77
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:41,399
mind hell I'm just talking to a few

78
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:43,560

that'll give me a fighting

90
00:04:12,438 --> 00:04:18,319
chance and I'd be damned if our federal

91
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:20,279
government is going to stop me from

92
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:22,550
making this choice because don't I

93
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:22,750
