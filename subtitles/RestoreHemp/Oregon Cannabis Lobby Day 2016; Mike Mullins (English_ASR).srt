3
00:00:03,089 --> 00:00:06,750
beginning of a session for us it's all

4
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,609
important that we all be involved my

5
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:10,859
name is mike mullins and i'm with stony

6
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:12,629
girl Gardens stony only dispensary and

7
00:00:10,859 --> 00:00:14,939
we have our PortMaster damn university

8
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:18,690
but today i'm not here to talk about my

9
00:00:14,939 --> 00:00:21,300
businesses i'm not here to talk about my

10
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:23,789
right to party i'm here to talk about my

11
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,618
right as a patient to qualified medicine

12
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:27,420
and to have access to that medicine

13
00:00:25,618 --> 00:00:29,368
wherever i live in the state of oregon

14
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,650
it's a shame that we now have gone

15
00:00:29,368 --> 00:00:34,590
backwards and gotten back to putting

16
00:00:31,649 --> 00:00:37,199
patients on the east side of our state

17
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:39,600
and in many other areas and denied them

18
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,850
access many of those patients cannot

19
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,710
afford to grow for themselves many of

20
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:45,780
them patients cannot do for themselves

21
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:47,989
whatsoever and depend on people such as

22
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:50,129
myself to be a caregiver in a grower

23
00:00:47,988 --> 00:00:52,259
unfortunately we're hearing stories that

24
00:00:50,128 --> 00:00:54,359
this has become so over regulated and so

25
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:56,219
costly that our patients are going to

26
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:58,350
lose access to qualified medicine

27
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:59,879
they've already lost access to the

28
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:02,160
places where they used to get their

29
00:00:59,878 --> 00:01:04,198
qualified medicine Michaela would never

30
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:07,500
have gotten her medicine in hermiston

31
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:09,390
store if it were closed she's alive

32
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,400
today because she was able to access

33
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:14,099
that medicine we all know that first of

34
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,719
all cannabis is medicine and to attest

35
00:01:14,099 --> 00:01:17,579
to that fact I can tell you that our

36
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:19,228
healthcare industries the largest ones

37
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:20,340
in the state of Oregon who provided the

38
00:01:19,228 --> 00:01:22,500
health insurance for all of the people

39
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:24,659
who are in this building have already

40
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,790
approached us and are looking for an

41
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:29,100
integrated path to cannabis therapeutics

42
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:32,130
because their doctors know that cannabis

43
00:01:29,099 --> 00:01:33,839
is medicine the fact is is that they've

44
00:01:32,129 --> 00:01:35,280
already approached us they're already

45
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,890
looking for an avenue we've already

46
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,049
given them a five-year integration path

47
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:41,909
to be able to utilize this for their own

48
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:43,618
purposes to recommend it to the patients

49
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:45,990
as they are now doing through licenses

50
00:01:43,618 --> 00:01:48,239
the fact is is that our lawmakers and

51
00:01:45,989 --> 00:01:50,099
our need to know that they have never

52
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:52,289
been able to legislate the black market

53
00:01:50,099 --> 00:01:54,030
and that's trying to do it now will

54
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:55,200
accomplish nothing but reinforce the

55
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:57,570
black market that we've worked so hard

56
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,520
to get rid of here in Oregon I would

57
00:01:57,569 --> 00:02:01,199
like to say I'm very proud of Oregon we

58
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:03,209
are the second oldest state in the

59
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,340
nation to have a medical marijuana

60
00:02:03,209 --> 00:02:07,109
program and have one of the most

61
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:09,239
successful medical marijuana programs

62
00:02:07,109 --> 00:02:09,899
it's unfortunate that the lawmakers in

63
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:14,819
their fear

64
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:18,900
and are trying to push prohibition again

65
00:02:14,818 --> 00:02:21,869
I only have one thing to say to our

66
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:23,640
legislators and that is instead of

67
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:26,969
taking this program back to Prohibition

68
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:28,619
and creating failure they should be

69
00:02:26,969 --> 00:02:30,359
focused on building the success of

70
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:33,769
Oregon's future and the advantage that

71
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:33,769
we may have thank you
