1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,318
my name is Anna Diaz and I am from the

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:07,000
normal Women's Alliance and I'm also one

3
00:00:05,318 --> 00:00:09,320
of the founders of Oregon

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,559
normal and I'd like to talk to you today

5
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:15,199
about

6
00:00:10,558 --> 00:00:17,519
legalization cuz it's time has come so

7
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:19,679
we got some really great news from the

8
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:23,118
doj it sounds like maybe they're going

9
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:25,879
to honor State's uh rights to

10
00:00:23,118 --> 00:00:28,118
legalization in Colorado and Washington

11
00:00:25,879 --> 00:00:30,518
and even in Oregon the legislature is

12
00:00:28,118 --> 00:00:32,519
already talking about

13
00:00:30,518 --> 00:00:35,920
creating a law there rather than letting

14
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:38,719
it go through the initiative process so

15
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,719
clearly the powers that be are starting

16
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,760
to understand that legalization is

17
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:45,079
something that the people want and

18
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:48,599
something that the people have requ are

19
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:51,198
requiring and that's really good news

20
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:55,039
the bad news is our people are still

21
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:57,799
getting busted yeah just this summer my

22
00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:00,840
good friend Lori from Southern Oregon

23
00:00:57,799 --> 00:01:05,079
got raided for providing safe access to

24
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:07,960
patients just this last week 14 private

25
00:01:05,079 --> 00:01:10,200
residents in or right here in Portland

26
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:13,478
got busted I haven't heard all the

27
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:15,560
details yet somebody left me a note that

28
00:01:13,478 --> 00:01:18,158
said well maybe they should have gotten

29
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:20,719
busted for shipping 50 lbs of weed to

30
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:23,000
Texas and New York and my first thought

31
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:25,400
was don't people in Texas and New York

32
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,400
need weed

33
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:31,520
too it is time for prohibition to end

34
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:34,880
and it is time for everybody out here

35
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:37,478
that's having a good time to step up and

36
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:39,560
contact your local representatives and

37
00:01:37,478 --> 00:01:43,000
your federal representatives and tell

38
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:46,478
them to stop sending us to jail stop

39
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,840
taking our babies stop destroying our

40
00:01:46,478 --> 00:01:51,478
families and allow us to consume

41
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:54,079
cannabis in peace like we're doing right

42
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:54,078
here right

43
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:01,799
now and you guys are the ones who can

44
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:03,718
make it happen I'm just one person and

45
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:06,880
I've had some kind of impact on this

46
00:02:03,718 --> 00:02:08,840
movement if every one of you stepped up

47
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:11,519
you could do the same thing I'm not

48
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:14,000
anybody special I'm just a person who's

49
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,519
pissed off and if you're not pissed off

50
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,439
about what's happening in CA with

51
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:20,680
cannabis in our community today then

52
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:23,159
you're not paying attention cuz even

53
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:25,560
though we are are are so fortunate that

54
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:28,400
we can be out here enjoying the freedom

55
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:31,039
of weed right here right now our people

56
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,360
are still getting busted our people are

57
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:35,598
still going to jail and it's mostly

58
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,680
people of color and people who are

59
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:39,518
younger so you kids who think it's

60
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,239
really cool to sell weed so you can pay

61
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,920
your rent you need to help us legalize

62
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,080
too because you can get a real job in

63
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:48,958
the Cannabis Community you can get

64
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:52,360
benefits you can have a 40-hour work

65
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:55,158
week and get paid to do that same thing

66
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:57,440
if we legalize if we can grow industrial

67
00:02:55,158 --> 00:02:59,280
hemp in this state the jobs that will be

68
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:01,439
created and the sustainability that it

69
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:05,360
will provide for us

70
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:08,799
is infinit large I can't even put it

71
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:11,720
into words it's so huge I was unemployed

72
00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:13,439
for 2 years trying to find a job here if

73
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:16,318
we have jobs through industrial hemp and

74
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:19,120
the Cannabis businesses that can be

75
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:23,119
built once we legalize I probably could

76
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:25,719
have had a job the first day so today I

77
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,039
ask you all as you're out here enjoying

78
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:30,680
