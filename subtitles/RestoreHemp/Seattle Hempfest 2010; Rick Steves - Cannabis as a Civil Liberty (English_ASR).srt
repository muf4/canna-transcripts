welcome thank you it's great to be here

21
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:51,238
andest yeah well I'm a travel writer and

22
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:55,000
for me high is a

23
00:00:51,238 --> 00:00:58,439
place it's a great place it's a place

24
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,359
where I can cook well my speakers sound

25
00:00:58,439 --> 00:01:02,439
better it's a place where convers

26
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:05,400
Slither around like straight

27
00:01:02,439 --> 00:01:06,959
CS sometimes I want to go to that place

28
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,118
and a lot of people

29
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:14,158
do and our government says we can't go

30
00:01:10,118 --> 00:01:15,879
there and today 880,000 Americans who

31
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,118
wanted to go to that place and went

32
00:01:15,879 --> 00:01:21,319
there are in jail in our

33
00:01:18,118 --> 00:01:22,759
country now there are scenarios where I

34
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:25,559
think it's okay for our government to

35
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:27,680
say you can't go there but there better

36
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,400
be a good reason when my government says

37
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,520
I can't go somewhere and when it comes

38
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:35,799
to getting High I don't think there's a

39
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:35,798
good reason for our government to say

40
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:46,118
no I believe that the mature responsible

41
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:47,320
adult recreational use of marijuana is a

42
00:01:46,118 --> 00:01:50,840
civil

43
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:53,519
liberty it is a civil liberty now it's a

44
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:56,600
drug it's a drug and I'm not promoting

45
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:59,920
it I acknowledge it's not healthy it can

46
00:01:56,599 --> 00:02:02,359
be abused it can be addictive it's not

47
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,960
for kids and if you drive Intoxicated by

48
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:06,478
anything they should throw the book at

49
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:10,000
you yeah but that doesn't get in the way

50
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:12,800
from the principle that enjoying

51
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,598
marijuana is a civil liberty that's

52
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,959
something we need to communicate to our

53
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:20,280
society now our government is waging a

54
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:22,959
war against marijuana a Perpetual

55
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,840
NeverEnding losing expensive

56
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:27,840
demoralizing to our police force eroding

57
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:31,439
credibility to our teachers and parents

58
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:34,519
war on marijuana it's a war based on

59
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:36,598
lives it's a war that cost our society

60
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:38,400
billions of dollars every year and it's

61
00:02:36,598 --> 00:02:41,199
a war that messes up hundreds of

62
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,719
thousands of American lives every year

63
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:46,158
this year alone 800,000 Americans were

64
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:49,080
arrested for enjoying marijuana they've

65
00:02:46,158 --> 00:02:51,840
got a criminal record now now I bring a

66
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:53,680
European perspective to the discussion

67
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:57,039
I've spent a third of my life hanging

68
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,879
out in Europe with people who think

69
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:00,679
marijuana is about exciting as the can

70
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:03,000
of beer it's just not a big

71
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:05,040
deal now when you think about the

72
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,479
European approach to drug problems and

73
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:08,798
they've got drug problems just like

74
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:10,919
we've got drug problems they measure

75
00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:13,000
their drug problems or the success of

76
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:15,399
their policies on drugs not by how many

77
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,039
people do you lock up but they measure

78
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:21,480
it based on a concept called harm

79
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:24,560
reduction this is a radical difference

80
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:27,919
between our and their approach to drug

81
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,799
abuse and drug problems in Europe they

82
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:32,238
want to take the crime out of the

83
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:35,239
equation and consider it a health

84
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:37,239
problem and an education Challenge and

85
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:40,319
my European friends tell me time and

86
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:43,360
time again that a society has to make a

87
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:45,039
choice tolerate alternative Lifestyles

88
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,360
or build more

89
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:49,079
prisons and then they always needle me

90
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,720
with that annoying little comment that

91
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,599
and in your country the United States of

92
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:55,840
America you lock up more people than

93
00:03:52,598 --> 00:03:58,280
anybody else in the world wow we lock up

94
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,560
eight times as many people per capita as

95
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:03,239
Europeans do wow

96
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,479
either we're inherently more criminal or

97
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:06,959
there's something screwy about our laws

98
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:09,199
and most of those people in our jails

99
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:12,199
are in there on drug

100
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:12,958
charges now what shapes American policy

101
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:16,199
on

102
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,798
drugs fear fear is a huge thing in our

103
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:21,120
society and it's a big part of this War

104
00:04:17,798 --> 00:04:23,519
on Drugs generations of Reaper Madness

105
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,720
propaganda and lies have been designed

106
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:28,120
to make people who have not paid very

107
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:30,960
careful attention to this issue simply

108
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:33,079
afraid of it there's a lot of Americans

109
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:35,279
who think there's a whole reservoir of

110
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:38,120
people who would just love to ruin their

111
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:40,319
lives with drug abuse if only it was

112
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:42,478
legal now in Portugal they

113
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:44,918
decriminalized they they legalized

114
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:46,879
consumption of all drugs 10 years ago

115
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:49,279
and you know what they learn more people

116
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:52,600
don't use drugs it's just no longer a

117
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:54,638
crime that's a pretty big Revelation a

118
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:56,479
lot of Americans think that marijuana is

119
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:59,160
a gateway drug a couple of toes and all

120
00:04:56,478 --> 00:05:01,199
of a sudden you're a heroin at it well

121
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,520
in the Netherlands it's been 25 years

122
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,319
since they've arrested anybody for

123
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:06,680
smoken pot and they've got a track

124
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:09,839
record they care about it as much as we

125
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:12,840
do and they found that not many more

126
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:14,719
people smoke marijuana and not any more

127
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:17,918
people are into hard drugs and their

128
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:20,680
hard drug taking population is aging

129
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:23,198
it's a successful thing when you take

130
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:25,840
the crime out of the

131
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:27,680
marijuana now if marijuana is a gateway

132
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:29,159
drug it's only a gateway drug because

133
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,000
it's illegal because that means there's

134
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:34,000
Criminal on the street with a vested

135
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
interest in getting you into marijuana

136
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,560
so you can get into more profitable more

137
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,160
expensive and more addictive drugs the

138
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,199
only thing Gateway about marijuana is

139
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,479
its

140
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:46,720
illegality now the United States is out

141
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:48,599
of sync with the world and we need to

142
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,240
wake America up and tell them that there

143
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,759
is a harm reduction approach to drug

144
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,079
abuse that is more effective and

145
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:56,240
pragmatic than locking people up

146
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:58,120
Hempfest is a wonderful celebration of

147
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,680
cannabis culture but I'll tell you we're

148
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:02,319
never going to legalize things un unless

149
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,639
you guys mobilize this is a great party

150
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:05,520
it's a lot of fun but you got to go out

151
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:07,000
there and make it not scary and you got

152
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:08,680
to get the truth through to people in

153
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,959
the sub who are scared to death about

154
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:13,079
this all right it's not scary now we

155
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:17,279
need

156
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:19,318
to support advocacy groups with our

157
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:21,318
money so they can wage our battle for us

158
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:23,039
I'm a board member of normal there's a

159
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:24,400
lot of good groups for 10 years I've

160
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:26,360
been a board member of Norman and I'll

161
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:28,439
tell you those advocacy groups that are

162
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:30,479
fighting against the drug war or drug

163
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:31,800
war in our country are not Charities

164
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:33,318
they're services and they're fighting

165
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,840
your battle and they're waging a

166
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:36,400
courageous and dogged struggle in our

167
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:39,439
state house and in our national

168
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:41,038
government we need to support them we're

169
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:42,879
at a cross routs right now in our

170
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:44,759
society just like we were in the 1930s

171
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:45,800
when we were taking down theug the laws

172
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:47,800
against

173
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:50,120
alcohol and courageous people are

174
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:53,120
starting to speak out now and it's an

175
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:56,079
exciting opportunity mayor LaGuardia of

176
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:58,120
New York in the 1930s said that if a

177
00:06:56,079 --> 00:07:00,120
society has a law on the books that it

178
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:02,319
does not intend to to enforce

179
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:04,478
consistently across the board the very

180
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,639
existence of that law corrodes law

181
00:07:04,478 --> 00:07:08,959
enforcement and respect of the law in

182
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:11,079
general in a society that's a serious

183
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:12,758
problem we've got that today there's no

184
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:14,159
intentions of enforcing our marijuana

185
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:16,560
laws they're not going to lock up all of

186
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:19,039
us if they did that tomorrow Seattle

187
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:22,038
would be a much less interesting

188
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:24,318
City I'm a hardworking kid- raising

189
00:07:22,038 --> 00:07:26,719
churchgoing taxpaying citizen of the

190
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,479
United States of America and if I work

191

joint that's my civil

193
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:38,360
liberty this is not hard on drugs it's

194
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:40,199
not soft on drugs I'm just trying to

195
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:42,639
inject a little bit of European common

196
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:45,080
sense and pragmatism we need to see

197
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:47,720
drugs as a health problem not a criminal

198
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:50,318
issue and then we can move Beyond hard

199
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:53,360
on drugs and soft on drugs we can be

200
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:55,560
smart on drugs all right thanks a lot

201
