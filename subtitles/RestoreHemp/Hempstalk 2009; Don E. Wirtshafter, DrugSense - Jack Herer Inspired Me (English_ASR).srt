1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,520
i'm donnie workshafter i live in ohio

2
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:08,959
i started ohio hippory

3
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:10,160
in 1990 why did i do that because jack

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,800
carrera

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,400
inspired me i was one of jack's first

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:17,278
converts

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,199
and i've been at it full time ever since

8
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:21,118
and i walked into

9
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,199
hip stock this evening

10
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:24,800
and the first thing i see is jack having

11
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:27,519
his heart attack or his stroke or

12
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,278
whatever it is that we just had

13
00:00:27,518 --> 00:00:31,198
and i'll tell you it was a shock to my

14
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:32,159
system it's difficult to speak to you

15
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,520
tonight

16
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:36,640
it's difficult

17
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,640
to be around right now

18
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:45,039
i first met jack in 1990 when he came

19
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:46,878
this is about when jack started to hit

20
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:49,600
the road we had a

21
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:52,399
just say no rally in honor of nancy

22
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:55,359
reagan at knoww and

23
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:57,520
jack came to athens ohio

24
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:59,600
and uh everybody talked him around he

25
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,879
meet me because i was the dope attorney

26
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,559
at the time

27
00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:04,719
and and uh

28
00:01:02,558 --> 00:01:06,640
jack spent the evening giving us his

29
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:08,798
wrap

30
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,560
and i've never been the same

31
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:13,040
and i think we have to recognize that

32
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,879
none of this would be here without jack

33
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,799
without jack hitting the road in the

34
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:18,560
early 1990s

35
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,600
when we had our

36
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,799
pep tour and we had oh what was it

37
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:25,359
called

38
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,759
we had a hemp bus going around

39
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:30,478
and we went college campus to college

40
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:34,400
campus year after year

41
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:36,959
jack every weekend traveling somewhere

42
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,560
jack's been a road warrior for 20 years

43
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:41,280
for this thing

44
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:44,240
he's become a road animal

45
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:47,200
to get from one venue to another every

46
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:50,640
weekend every weekend carry the books

47
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,719
set up the table set up the

48
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,759
speaking thing doing the whole thing

49
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:57,840
signing books for hours on end

50
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,920
it wasn't always as easy for jack he

51
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,439
didn't always have so much help

52
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,920
there was a time people didn't know who

53
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:03,919
he was

54
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,759
but he just kept going from college

55
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:11,120
campus to college campus trying to raise

56
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:12,399
the image of him

57
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,280
and it worked

58
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,680
by 1995 everybody knew what hemp was

59
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,759
everybody who knew who jack herrera was

60
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,520
and then they named a variety after him

61
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:24,479
more people know about the variety and

62
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,480
they know about jack

63
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,080
right

64
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:29,679
so

65
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,160
you know we have to recognize that none

66
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,920
of us would be here without jack jack

67
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:36,878
started this thing

68
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:39,199
jack knew he wasn't feeling well jack's

69
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:42,239
wife begged with him not to come up here

70
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:45,039
this weekend but jack is the road animal

71
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:47,519
jack goes somewhere every weekend jack

72
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:49,439
had to come to oregon

73
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,519
now some of you might remember eight

74
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:53,919
nine ten years ago when jack had another

75
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:56,159
stroke same thing

76
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:58,159
he was down at condes we were having a

77
00:02:56,159 --> 00:03:01,280
world hip expo

78
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:03,519
he gave a rousing speech on stage he

79
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,878
walks off backstage and probably has a

80
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,280
stroke

81
00:03:04,878 --> 00:03:09,359
the same thing happened here tonight

82
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,959
most of you were spared having to

83
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,319
see this

84
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,239
it was not

85
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:16,479
pretty i'm really glad

86
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,640
that we had so many good emts here in

87
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:20,238
the crowd people without the right

88
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:21,839
equipment but who knew what to do to

89
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,959
take care of jack

90
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,120
and people

91
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:27,120
people kept working on jack and working

92
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,519
on jack and you know pushing on his

93
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,439
chest 15 times and breathing in his

94
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,599
mouth once and push it out of the chest

95
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:34,799
and they kept him alive for probably 20

96
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:37,119
minutes

97
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:39,680
until the emts came with the oxygen and

98
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,920
with the electro shocks and with

99
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,920
the

100
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:47,039
ivs and all that stuff

101
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,719
i'm happy to report i kept a pretty good

102
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:50,798
eye on it i'm happy to report that they

103
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:52,719
were able to stabilize jack he was

104
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:55,120
breathing on his own when they took him

105
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:57,439
out of here

106
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,439
all right

107
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:03,200
i really fear for him though because

108
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:05,279
this this was either a really massive

109
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:07,119
stroke or a fairly massive heart attack

110
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,400
he was

111
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,080
he was a

112
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,840
hurting puppy when they carried him out

113
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,799
of here okay

114
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,280
so

115
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:17,759
i think we all you know the organs

116
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:20,319
organizers of the show had to think oh

117
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,919
my god can we go on is it the right

118
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:24,399
thing for us to do to shut down the

119
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:26,319
event tonight in memory of jack or you

120
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:28,399
know and all that and then they thought

121
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:29,759
about what would jack do

122
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:33,439
right

123
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:35,520
the show must go on right

124
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:37,680

jack carrera would want you to do it

159
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,120
right

160
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,280
so

161
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,600
jack needs to stand our thoughts he's

162
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:56,239
really on the edge he's really

163
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,160
in a precarious position right now and

164
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,319
the best we could do i mean one of the

165
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:03,439
things was that people backstage were

166
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:07,279
going come on jack hey jack come on jack

167
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:08,879
you know we weren't going to get that

168
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:11,599
we weren't going to let that spirit go

169
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:13,600
away from our presence there were people

170
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,199
just sitting backstage just praying for

171
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,240
