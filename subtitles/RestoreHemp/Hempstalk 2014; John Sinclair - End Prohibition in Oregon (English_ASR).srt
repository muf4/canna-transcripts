1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,278
nice to be in oregon

2
00:00:02,638 --> 00:00:07,278
or you're about to do something really

3
00:00:05,278 --> 00:00:09,679
smart

4
00:00:07,278 --> 00:00:12,320
and that is to get the police and the

5
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:13,839
authorities of our company society out

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,160
of our lives

7
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:18,399
so we can get high and enjoy ourselves

8
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,679
without having to worry about these

9
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:24,320
goons and their uniforms

10
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:24,320
this uh

11
00:00:25,118 --> 00:00:28,719
i've been doing this for a long time we

12
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:33,920
had our first hippie gathering in

13
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:35,839
detroit where i'm from in 1967

14
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,000
just like this

15
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,559
well we didn't have as good of a sound

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,558
system or a state

17
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:46,640
but then what happened the police wrote

18
00:00:42,558 --> 00:00:48,439
down on it so they're always

19
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,520
in ann arbor when we used to have

20
00:00:48,439 --> 00:00:54,878
pre-concerts every sunday

21
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,840
we used to pay off the police

22
00:00:54,878 --> 00:00:59,599
to not come on to the

23
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:01,280
site they could have they had to stay in

24
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,239
the parking lot

25
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:06,960
and take care of the parking traffic

26
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:09,040
because we thought if they came in

27
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:11,679
to the free concerts they would just

28
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,280
kill everybody's high

29
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,920
and they'd be walking around their

30
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:19,040
helmets and their guns and their radios

31
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,040
and all that horse [ __ ]

32
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:24,960
so we had to pay them off to keep them

33
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:28,399
outside but today this is a new low for

34
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:30,399
me when the hemp stock

35
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,640
organization

36
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,079
has to pay these guys to come in here

37
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,960
and hassle us

38
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:36,959
i don't get it

39
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:41,438
i think once you legalize it to get that

40
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:43,759
over with yeah

41
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:45,279
i'm all due respect to these guys i know

42
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:48,159
they serve a

43
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,960
important role as security guards in our

44
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:53,040
society but hey i feel secure as a

45
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:55,599
[ __ ] out here

46
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:59,040
you know what i'm saying i feel really

47
00:01:55,599 --> 00:02:00,959
unsafe with this kind of environment

48
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,040
of uh armed

49
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:06,639
uniform characters

50
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,640
walking amongst us okay

51
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:11,439
i could talk about the police all day

52
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,360
but i'm not going to

53
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:15,840
i'm really a poet

54
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,840
i became activist because the police

55
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,360
wouldn't leave me alone i had to fight

56
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,479
back

57
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,480
so

58
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:24,399
that was 50 years ago

59
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:27,598
that's a long time ago

60
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,360
most you know ain't even 50 yet

61
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:33,199
so

62
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:35,280
i'm really ecstatic to be here

63
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:37,919
and i'd like to give you a few poems if

64
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,239
i could i don't want to

65
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:43,280
[ __ ] up your afternoon but hey this is

66
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:45,920
what i do and ask me to be here

67
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:50,759
like to start with a prayer

68
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:50,759
inspired by the music of john coltrane

69
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,280
what is jazz

70
00:02:54,159 --> 00:03:01,199
but spirituals

71
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:04,680
played through saxophones

72
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:04,679
and trombones

73
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:08,479
spirit voices

74
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:10,799
through

75
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:14,318
metal tubings

76
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:17,239
and the terrible repetition of the

77
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:20,479
formal premise phys

78
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:22,560
trance-like at its best

79
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:27,679
or boring

80
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,680
when the spirit does not move

81
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:33,919
oh what is blue

82
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:36,079
but spirituals

83
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:38,399
with the line

84
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,879
removed

85
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:44,319
that is structurally

86
00:03:40,878 --> 00:03:48,239
and in content just a prayer

87
00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:50,719
to the gods of daily life

88
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:53,519
to ask the blessing

89
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:57,120
that the body of another

90
00:03:53,519 --> 00:04:02,319
may lay warm in the bed

91
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:03,759
beside you at night and the rent be paid

92
00:04:02,318 --> 00:04:05,598
and a meal

93
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:07,919
on the table

94
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:08,798
with the sheriff

95
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:10,479
far

96
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:15,719
away

97
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:15,719
from the scene of the crime

98
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:23,680
oh what is jazz but the registration

99
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:28,240
of the human personality

100
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:29,680
in relation to the spiritual

101
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,319
stripped

102
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:36,120
of literal meaning

103
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:38,000
but full of sound

104
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:44,560
important

105
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,560
direct as the voice of the gods

106
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,120
spiritual
