1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,240
what groups or organizations or

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:07,120
individuals

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,800
have inspired you in your life

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,559
well my

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,320
listen if it wasn't for an extremely

6
00:00:10,558 --> 00:00:14,879
good mama and the freddie mediaville

7
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,480
maximum security prison i'd gone wrong a

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,000
really long time ago

9
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,359
so my mom has probably kept me on

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,160
straight and narrow more than anybody

11
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,199
else

12
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,399
but uh

13
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:25,439
when i uh

14
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:26,799
as i got older i became desperate for a

15
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,240
role model

16
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:32,000
and uh

17
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:32,000
so uh i

18
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,840
looked for the people who i thought was

19
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:38,078
just the right things

20
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,079
uh

21
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:44,000
there are signs

22
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:45,759
uh so uh i decided and quite frankly if

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,520
you wanna know the truth i decided to

24
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:48,558
just decide you need the new hero and

25
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,120
there's no reason to worry why i

26
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:53,280
shouldn't be it right you know

27
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:55,519
well every every generation between win

28
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,960
its own freedom and our past generation

29
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:02,000
had such icons as as faulty as the word

30
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,920

31
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,319
eastwood as being a

32
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,840
sovereign individual human beings

33
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:09,039
but this younger generation doesn't have

34
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,000
many heroes

35
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,960
i mean

36
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,959

37
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:29,438
like who shot liberty now

38
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:31,118
uh when when but somebody who's just

39
00:01:29,438 --> 00:01:33,279
trying to do right

40
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:36,400
has to stand up against some unspeakable

41
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,200
villain uh who who threatens uh the the

42
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,640
very

43
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,840
freedom and soul of these protagonists

44
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,920
um

45
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,320

46
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,560
nowadays are next to lessons

47
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:50,158
and that chinese gentleman

48
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,680
