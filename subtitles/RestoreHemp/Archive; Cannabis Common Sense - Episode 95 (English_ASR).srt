interviews that were over a month of

28
00:01:20,969 --> 00:01:28,349
shows last year where Paul Loney and

29
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:30,689
myself and our art producer went up to

30
00:01:28,349 --> 00:01:34,109

35
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:51,240
that we didn't get into the the show

36
00:01:44,188 --> 00:01:52,949
last year when we covered that we didn't

37
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:54,688
use this interview where mark Emery

38
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:56,728
actually was across the street from the

39
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:58,019
two businesses he started yeah I should

40
00:01:56,728 --> 00:01:59,478
give you everybody a little background

41
00:01:58,019 --> 00:02:02,509
of

42
00:01:59,478 --> 00:02:05,299
and what's 40 lead into today's

43
00:02:02,509 --> 00:02:07,340
situation as it's probably a lot of you

44
00:02:05,299 --> 00:02:10,189
know Marc Emery was the you know the

45
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:12,830
founder of the HEVC Empire that's known

46
00:02:10,189 --> 00:02:16,039
up there and he started off with a

47
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:17,930
magazine cannabis can of Canada which is

48
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:20,479
now called canvas culture and it's still

49
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:22,969
a very good magazine I mean he also had

50
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:26,119
a seed sale store that he that he found

51
00:02:22,969 --> 00:02:29,030
it and he does that by mail order now

52
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:32,090
and he founded a outlet store for hemp

53
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:34,060
clothing and smoking accessories and a

54
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:37,849
little restaurant next door to that

55
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:39,830
which was called cannabis cafe which was

56
00:02:37,849 --> 00:02:42,859
had all sorts of delicious food and

57
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:45,110
beverages that had hemp involved in the

58
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:47,720
preparation of it some way from cannabis

59
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:50,660
coffee a mixture of coffee and cannabis

60
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:53,780
into a nice hot beverage vegetarian

61
00:02:50,659 --> 00:02:56,568
burgers with hemp seed in it and a lot

62
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:57,799
of hemp seed oil and I thought delicious

63
00:02:56,568 --> 00:02:58,458
what did you think Paul I thought the

64
00:02:57,799 --> 00:03:02,450
food was great

65
00:02:58,459 --> 00:03:05,599
there was homemade fresh using fresh

66
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:07,669
organic ingredients and hemp seed oil

67
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:10,250
and in just about everything in hemp

68
00:03:07,669 --> 00:03:14,629
seed meal which adds a kind of a nutty

69
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:17,030
flavor in a texture to the food when the

70
00:03:14,629 --> 00:03:18,979
the hulls of the hip cedar are present

71
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:21,560
yeah I thought it was great it was it

72
00:03:18,979 --> 00:03:24,768
was a the whole it was such a very nice

73
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:28,400
atmosphere up there very low-key people

74
00:03:24,769 --> 00:03:30,650
there were respectful of each other of

75
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,109
the city itself I mean you know they

76
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:33,680
didn't have people congregating out

77
00:03:33,109 --> 00:03:36,170
front

78
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,000
you know you know looking like derelict

79
00:03:36,169 --> 00:03:40,039
sore anything or I mean it was just like

80
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,780
if you walk by on the street you think

81
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:44,629
there's two more businesses in the

82
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:46,489
middle of you know urban Vancouver doing

83
00:03:44,629 --> 00:03:48,739
a really good thing it's there on its

84
00:03:46,489 --> 00:03:50,870
west hastings street folks if you get up

85
00:03:48,739 --> 00:03:52,969
that way i definitely recommend you

86
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:54,409
check it out it's right near the gas

87
00:03:52,969 --> 00:03:56,060
light district or it might actually be

88
00:03:54,409 --> 00:03:57,949
in again what guys like district I know

89
00:03:56,060 --> 00:04:02,090
the actual boundaries but it's on West

90
00:03:57,949 --> 00:04:04,399
Hastings and and recently marc emery

91
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:07,370
started all his business and because he

92
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,289
become such a high-profile person and

93
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:09,950
was always challenging the authorities

94
00:04:09,289 --> 00:04:12,318
taking out

95
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:14,899
to ads when the heads of states came in

96
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:17,238
to Vancouver BC and fight them all down

97
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:19,850
to enjoy a nice bowl at his restaurant

98
00:04:17,238 --> 00:04:21,108
that the government felt they had to

99
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:23,810
crack down on him because he was too

100
00:04:21,108 --> 00:04:26,719
high-profile I mean he was very media

101
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:28,930
friendly very photogenic very quotable

102
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:32,870
person as you'll see in the interview

103
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:35,360
they went after him and they had a lot

104
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:37,250
of phony they had rage where they came

105
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,650
in and they may be able to haul out his

106
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:42,769
inventory worth thousands of dollars ten

107
00:04:39,649 --> 00:04:45,138
thousand dollars and had all locked up

108
00:04:42,769 --> 00:04:47,389
which is his money and he had employees

109
00:04:45,139 --> 00:04:49,340
and if we had to put out of work and he

110
00:04:47,389 --> 00:04:50,810
finally you know had a deal with the

111
00:04:49,339 --> 00:04:54,560
authorities up there that he could sell

112
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:57,410
his businesses for the hemp pcs store

113
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:00,410
and a canvas cafe store and his Law

114
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:01,820
Center that he started to protect people

115
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:03,530
who were busted for growing or

116
00:05:01,819 --> 00:05:05,540
possession he had sell those three

117
00:05:03,529 --> 00:05:07,309
businesses to the folks who are right

118
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:09,410
actually running the businesses for him

119
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:11,030
and he would get out of that totally and

120
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:14,120
he would just be into himself his

121
00:05:11,029 --> 00:05:15,978
magazine the seed sales and so that's

122
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,389
where it was lashed this is about two

123
00:05:15,978 --> 00:05:19,159
years ago that's where it was last year

124
00:05:17,389 --> 00:05:20,810
in Reptar visiting and you'll see him

125
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,610
like every talking about it as part of

126
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:25,370
that deal he wasn't allowed on that

127
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:26,810
block where his shops were that's why we

128
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:27,620
interviewed him outdoors across the

129
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:31,879
street from there

130
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:36,350
exactly and from that point sister I see

131
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:37,579
took over the hem PC store and I don't

132
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:40,160
remember who though who was actually

133
00:05:37,579 --> 00:05:41,659
running the cafe at that time but his

134
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,930
name was mark but I can't recall his

135
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:46,910
last name but then that's where it was

136
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:48,800
and then in the meantime sister I see

137
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:51,080
had applied for a business license since

138
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,930
was a transfer of ownership and she has

139
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:55,490
a temporary license and the city said

140
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:57,350
okay we're gonna make you you know go

141
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:59,240
through all these hoops because even

142
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:02,090
after she came in took it over they raid

143
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:05,288
a place twice claimers underage use in

144
00:06:02,089 --> 00:06:09,379
there smoking and they had to remove the

145
00:06:05,288 --> 00:06:10,579
vaporizers from the cafe part of it and

146
00:06:09,379 --> 00:06:12,469
show she was going through a lot of

147
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:14,629
hassle having to spend a lot of money

148
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:18,140
and hiring lawyers to defend her right

149
00:06:14,629 --> 00:06:21,740
to have a legitimate business selling

150
00:06:18,139 --> 00:06:23,419
clothing and smoking accessories and

151
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:26,240
they were still

152
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:28,400
not owned by the same person but the

153
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,019
cannabis cafe was next door while we

154
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:32,509
were there they just pulled the

155
00:06:30,019 --> 00:06:38,089
vaporizers off of each of the tabletops

156
00:06:32,509 --> 00:06:39,829
but they now at this point they've made

157
00:06:38,089 --> 00:06:41,959
it a Members Only Club where you have to

158
00:06:39,829 --> 00:06:44,899
come in and become a member before you

159
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:47,269
can actually go into the cannabis cafe

160
00:06:44,899 --> 00:06:49,459
and eat and perhaps

161
00:06:47,269 --> 00:06:51,139
smoke there but right around the corner

162
00:06:49,459 --> 00:06:53,239
there's another stall store called

163
00:06:51,139 --> 00:06:57,229
little Amsterdam and since then they've

164
00:06:53,240 --> 00:07:00,530
been busted once and then just in late

165
00:06:57,230 --> 00:07:03,080
April across the street another business

166
00:07:00,529 --> 00:07:06,799
is opened up that sells marijuana this

167
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:09,469
time now hip BC sold marijuana seeds but

168
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,910
never actually sold marijuana per se at

169
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:13,130
the store where this new business

170
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:15,260
directly across the street there on West

171
00:07:13,129 --> 00:07:18,290
Hastings sells marijuana for medical

172
00:07:15,259 --> 00:07:20,629
purposes however you can state your

173
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:22,910
medical purposes so someone with our

174
00:07:20,629 --> 00:07:25,459
show was up there just recently as we're

175
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:28,130
taping and they went in said they had

176
00:07:25,459 --> 00:07:30,169
migraines got some marijuana so it's

177
00:07:28,129 --> 00:07:32,629
it's pretty easy to do it's not like

178
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:35,750
here in Oregon with our ballot measure

179
00:07:32,629 --> 00:07:38,120
67 you have to have the your physician

180
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:39,889
fill out a whole raft of new forms that

181
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:41,540
they've just come up with and put down

182
00:07:39,889 --> 00:07:43,909
an application fee before you get a

183
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:46,370
picture ID there you can just go in and

184
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:49,189
immediately access marijuana and buy it

185
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:51,139
also under our bill no sales are allowed

186
00:07:49,189 --> 00:07:52,279
so the patients have to grow it

187
00:07:51,139 --> 00:07:54,529
themselves and that's often very

188
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:55,849
difficult for a wheelchair-bound MS

189
00:07:54,529 --> 00:08:00,500
patient or someone undergoing

190
00:07:55,850 --> 00:08:02,960
chemotherapy for cancer yeah well we can

191
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:04,730
go in and talk a bit about sister icees

192
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:07,069
current problems and what happened up

193
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:08,750
there with her business license appeals

194
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:11,329
a City Council because they denied her

195
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:13,550
and she had to appeal the City Council

196
00:08:11,329 --> 00:08:15,169
where we could run the video mark first

197
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:17,329
what would you think let's go ahead and

198
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:20,050
run that video it's four and a half

199
00:08:17,329 --> 00:08:22,219
minutes I think it's a real good

200
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:24,230
interview it's right across the street

201
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:26,570
from mark stork or so he'll explain all

202
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:28,939
that in the tape yeah they'll give you a

203
00:08:26,569 --> 00:08:33,819
good history and we can update it when

204
00:08:28,939 --> 00:08:37,259
we get back so roll the tape please

205
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:37,259
[Music]

206

we're with Marc Emery across the street

207
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:46,519
from MPC and cannabis cafe

208
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:51,089
this is a street you can't cross Mallya

209
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:52,500
the famous place there's the cafe at the

210
00:08:51,089 --> 00:08:54,420
quarter million dollar thought finding

211
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:56,220
the restaurant now at least get good

212

reviews in New York Times and Rolling

213
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:59,278
Stone another place from the hippest

214
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:01,050
store we used to call the hem PC

215
00:08:59,278 --> 00:09:03,870
superstore the little grow shop was

216
00:09:01,049 --> 00:09:06,899
downstairs MPC upstairs a cafe on the

217
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:08,278
one side we were also residents of the

218
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:10,679
second and third floors we were building

219
00:09:08,278 --> 00:09:11,820
a Montessori School the NBC Montessori

220
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:13,528
School was being built on the third

221
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:15,028
floor and the second floor is going to

222
00:09:13,528 --> 00:09:16,740
be where cannabis Canada magazines good

223
00:09:15,028 --> 00:09:18,000
and then when they cancer our licenses

224
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:19,889
we canceled all those programs but we're

225
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,629
gonna have a school incorporate there

226
00:09:19,889 --> 00:09:23,100
for the children of our staff that's

227
00:09:21,629 --> 00:09:25,169
perfectly linear oh yeah we had a lot of

228
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:28,139
wonderful but we employed 43 people

229
00:09:25,169 --> 00:09:29,729
full-time up till the end of January and

230
00:09:28,139 --> 00:09:31,409
of course basically 30 people are still

231
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:33,420
kept but only nine under my actual

232
00:09:31,409 --> 00:09:35,659
employment now those are run by their

233
00:09:33,419 --> 00:09:37,639
own new owners and

234
00:09:35,659 --> 00:09:40,069
what was it quite a sort of like

235
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:42,289
divesting yourself of your being oh I

236
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:44,329
was sad for a couple of weeks but you

237
00:09:42,289 --> 00:09:46,429
get to accept everything in this world

238
00:09:44,328 --> 00:09:48,379
I've learned to not you want to come in

239
00:09:46,429 --> 00:09:49,969
for this bit I've learned not to be too

240
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:51,828
concerned about property or things that

241
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:53,899
the women property they all come and go

242
00:09:51,828 --> 00:09:56,299
you've got to enjoy the process by which

243
00:09:53,899 --> 00:09:57,679
they've you know come and gone and to

244
00:09:56,299 --> 00:09:59,208
that degree I'm really happy with what

245
00:09:57,679 --> 00:10:01,429
we've done not necessarily happy with

246
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:03,469
what I've ended up with but that's a

247
00:10:01,429 --> 00:10:06,439
great no that's the end isn't here yet

248
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:08,060
right that's true totally oh they'll be

249
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,380
happy and eveness oh they're still happy

250
00:10:08,059 --> 00:10:11,028
and there's lots of happy endings every

251
00:10:09,379 --> 00:10:12,500
day and there's always tragedies and the

252
00:10:11,028 --> 00:10:14,208
things that get in the way and obstacles

253
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,889
to that's the inevitable process of

254
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:17,268
living we just can't be got to be

255
00:10:15,889 --> 00:10:18,799
courageous and face up to them and not

256
00:10:17,269 --> 00:10:19,909
be cowardly and look at our obligations

257
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:21,708
straight in the face and go ahead and do

258
00:10:19,909 --> 00:10:23,419
the work that needs to be done so you're

259
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:25,159
not allowed to go across the street to a

260
00:10:23,419 --> 00:10:25,779
door I cannot leave this park and go

261
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:27,309
down

262
00:10:25,779 --> 00:10:29,799
and this is after they raid you the

263
00:10:27,309 --> 00:10:31,539
second time no this is after they two

264
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:34,659
Americans went back and claimed they

265
00:10:31,539 --> 00:10:36,099
gave them $5.00 per hash yes and then

266
00:10:34,659 --> 00:10:37,449
that was held around for a couple of

267
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,920
months until they decided they wanted to

268
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:40,180
keep me awake for that block the Rolling

269
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:41,740
Stone article just came out they did not

270
00:10:40,179 --> 00:10:43,179
want they wanted to torture me by having

271
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:44,799
all these people come to find me and

272
00:10:43,179 --> 00:10:47,489
look for me but I'm not allowed to meet

273
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:47,490
them type of thing

274
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:54,160
so I had to sell them in next to nothing

275
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:55,600
but its own to my employee so they're

276
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:57,879
run by people who understand how to run

277
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,200
them and then you kept the debt oh yeah

278
00:10:57,879 --> 00:11:00,669
I kept the debt yeah they didn't even

279
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,839
put any money down they just paid me on

280
00:11:00,669 --> 00:11:04,659
a weekly basis like a salaried employee

281
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:06,030
for five years haha and yeah so I'm busy

282
00:11:04,659 --> 00:11:07,829
paying off the debt

283
00:11:06,029 --> 00:11:09,839
well the debts not that bad all things

284
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:11,879
considered it's on you about $100,000

285
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:14,399
will pay that down a couple of are you

286
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:16,439
trying to challenge the restriction from

287
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:18,389
going to the store no no the please one

288
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:19,410
that's so bad that if I just learned

289
00:11:18,389 --> 00:11:21,830
they just tried to make something else

290
00:11:19,409 --> 00:11:23,240
to get the judges you insane

291
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:24,649
sometimes you have to learn to play ball

292
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:27,230
I mean like I said anyone united states

293
00:11:24,649 --> 00:11:29,870
that be in jail for 20 years right so

294
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:31,129
Canadians have learned they'll put up

295
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:33,278
with me to some degree I'm in the

296
00:11:31,129 --> 00:11:34,778
establishment

297
00:11:33,278 --> 00:11:35,948
but you know they can play hardball when

298
00:11:34,778 --> 00:11:37,838
they want but they also like to send

299
00:11:35,948 --> 00:11:40,750
messages in lieu of any really big

300
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:42,430
action and despite what it would appear

301
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:43,659
to me like duties and $14,000 was

302
00:11:42,429 --> 00:11:45,519
bedroom Tori over four years in two

303
00:11:43,659 --> 00:11:48,269
rates it's pretty big but to them that's

304
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,269
just a message

305
00:11:53,309 --> 00:11:56,479
you know this is the street in

306
00:11:56,559 --> 00:12:01,338
hard for you

307
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:03,528
one of the work camps cafe was

308
00:12:01,339 --> 00:12:05,329
when where MVC is was where the Eastern

309
00:12:03,528 --> 00:12:06,720
art store has moved over cabbage we

310
00:12:05,328 --> 00:12:08,699
think this new that was

311
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:11,700
another building down there can rebuilt

312
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:14,220
it was abandoned across the street where

313
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:16,110
the FBC legal assistance center is now

314
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:17,610
as a fire bomb building and the

315
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:19,440
building's adjacent were abandoned

316
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:21,740
including this whole thing and now the

317
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,740
box

318
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:26,780
and it's anchored on our businessman

319
00:12:24,299 --> 00:12:26,779
feature in the

320
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:34,899
they say you know in talk about public

321
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:36,669
safety unique people around

322
00:12:34,899 --> 00:12:37,929
people around going in on this so we

323
00:12:36,669 --> 00:12:39,219
used to patrol the streets we used to

324
00:12:37,929 --> 00:12:40,919
have our own private police here there

325
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:42,629
was nothing

326
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:44,278
when we rented we had people patrolling

327
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:46,409
and so we had private cops everything

328
00:12:44,278 --> 00:12:49,278
our own people all that it's very nicely

329
00:12:46,409 --> 00:12:49,278
organized block

330
00:12:53,740 --> 00:13:01,080
oh yeah that's just right over across

331
00:12:56,529 --> 00:13:01,079
the street here right oh yeah right

332
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:09,339
when we've heard all of your neighbors

333
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:09,339
really loved you yeah

334
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:15,420
so I hope you enjoyed that interview I

335
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:18,278
think it kind of illustrates some of the

336
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:20,528
crazy insanity that our drug work can

337
00:13:18,278 --> 00:13:21,789
lead us to and in particular with Marc

338
00:13:20,528 --> 00:13:24,220
Emery do you want to update him on the

339
00:13:21,789 --> 00:13:27,490
story of what's happened with well we

340
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:31,120
have a sister I see the the woman who

341
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:32,500
Marc Emery sold the store to as he was

342
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,379
forced to sell a story to get out of his

343
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:37,750
legal problems she was she was deer

344
00:13:35,379 --> 00:13:40,059
running the store great baking then a

345
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:44,289
couple times and raided they hauled off

346
00:13:40,059 --> 00:13:46,809
some of her inventory once and they then

347
00:13:44,289 --> 00:13:48,969
they charged her at one point meanwhile

348
00:13:46,809 --> 00:13:50,828
Bush likes a back up bit here she was

349
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:52,480
applying for a business license and she

350
00:13:50,828 --> 00:13:54,549
hang on from the City Council because

351
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:58,360
the license bureau was recommending

352
00:13:54,549 --> 00:14:00,659
denial and then meantime one times in

353
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:03,039
the investor they charged her with

354
00:14:00,659 --> 00:14:05,708
what's the term they have up there was

355
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:07,179
facilitating the use of cannabis you

356
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:08,588
know the little substance by actually

357
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:10,958
selling these smoking devices they

358
00:14:08,589 --> 00:14:13,209
charge her it's almost like livin of

359
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:16,889
like delivery which is pretty serious

360
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:20,078
charge and she was fighting that and

361
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:22,208
then but same time she went after them

362
00:14:20,078 --> 00:14:25,809
saying that they were you know had

363
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:27,219
unlawfully seized her property and so

364
00:14:25,809 --> 00:14:29,919
that was a stay enough in the court

365
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:32,350
system there and that they had they had

366
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:35,110
sister a cease claims that they had made

367
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:38,079
a deal where they would drop the charge

368
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:41,980
of her facilitating use of cannabis

369
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:44,229
myyy by selling these products and and

370
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:46,389
she would drop her claim of them season

371
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:48,250
her property and going for damages and

372
00:14:46,389 --> 00:14:50,230
then therefore the but none of and so

373
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:52,269
that couldn't be brought up at the City

374
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:56,170
Council printed process the process of

375
00:14:52,269 --> 00:14:59,289
her you know I've heard being charged

376
00:14:56,169 --> 00:15:01,179
with contributing to the use of cannabis

377
00:14:59,289 --> 00:15:02,769
who selling these products but when a

378
00:15:01,179 --> 00:15:04,778
hearing came from the City Council they

379
00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:07,028
had different hearings the mayor had to

380
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:08,828
recuse himself because he stayed on the

381
00:15:07,028 --> 00:15:11,259
first and the first hearing that these

382
00:15:08,828 --> 00:15:14,019
people be gone by Christmas so he had to

383
00:15:11,259 --> 00:15:16,448
recuse himself but he meanwhile he was

384
00:15:14,019 --> 00:15:18,339
backstage pouring strings for the

385
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:18,909
temporary mayor who had the advice mayor

386
00:15:18,339 --> 00:15:21,340
who was

387
00:15:18,909 --> 00:15:23,199
there in the chair ran the show they

388
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:24,670
they brought all these up all these

389
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:26,500
charges alleging that she was

390
00:15:24,669 --> 00:15:27,610
contributing to the use of cannabis by

391
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,289
selling his products

392
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:31,330
her lawyers did a good job of

393
00:15:29,289 --> 00:15:33,009
complaining and saying this it should be

394
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:36,490
allowed to hear those evidence the City

395
00:15:33,009 --> 00:15:38,679
Council didn't care and then they went

396
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:39,879
on you know the city attorney was saying

397
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:41,199
you know bringing up all the old horror

398
00:15:39,879 --> 00:15:43,899
stories that we've all heard about

399
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:45,730
through all the years that cannabis you

400
00:15:43,899 --> 00:15:48,399
know leads from everything from your

401
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:51,909
hair falling out to to you know murder

402
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:53,199
of innocent children and finally even

403
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:54,879
the City Council had to cut them off

404
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:57,040
because the same tourney was going so

405
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:59,950
far to defend on this but they voted

406
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:02,709
unanimously to deny her their license

407
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:05,520
saying that she is contributing to the

408
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:07,690
delinquency of Canadian minors

409
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:09,579
Vancouver's minders by not you know

410
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:13,930
carding people who come into a store at

411
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:15,340
a shop and and by selling to anybody you

412
00:16:13,929 --> 00:16:17,049
know talk to anybody and everybody that

413
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:19,810
there was open smoking going on in her

414
00:16:17,049 --> 00:16:22,329
store and it's very interesting it came

415
00:16:19,809 --> 00:16:24,009
out at one point that a US Marine and a

416
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:27,009
royal K Mounted Police went in

417
00:16:24,009 --> 00:16:29,980
undercover to the store and verse you

418
00:16:27,009 --> 00:16:31,210
know asking for marijuana in the store

419
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:33,039
claimed that they had health problems

420
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:34,750
and they were saying that therefore

421
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:36,969
that's one of the reasons that because

422
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:38,350
she was held to a u.s. Marine and we all

423
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:41,529
came out to police that they should

424
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:43,000
close her down and so they came after

425
00:16:41,529 --> 00:16:45,240
her and so they vote deny she's

426
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,679
appealing out of the court system and

427
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:50,169
belief that she can temporarily keep her

428
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:52,059
store open but if she was in court she

429
00:16:50,169 --> 00:16:52,569
will have to sell the store to somebody

430
00:16:52,059 --> 00:16:53,769
else

431
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:56,620
and they go through all the print

432
00:16:53,769 --> 00:16:58,569
process or they closed the store and

433
00:16:56,620 --> 00:17:01,990
meanwhile she's running a large legal

434
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:03,550
bill up there and when they you know and

435
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:06,910
they use little snippets of her talking

436
00:17:03,549 --> 00:17:08,889
about how she uses cannabis to you know

437
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:10,620
for her medical problems and she thinks

438
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:13,459
there's a great medical benefit

439
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:15,808
and and how her children are all healthy

440
00:17:13,459 --> 00:17:18,000
they use these little words this

441
00:17:15,808 --> 00:17:19,500
bulletin if it's from interviewed she's

442
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,740
given like the one she gave in our show

443
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:24,180
years ago last year but saying that she

444
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:27,000
believes in cannabis and they said oh

445
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:29,070
that makes her evil in any case that's

446
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,829
where it stands as a another sad story

447
00:17:29,069 --> 00:17:33,389
of government oppression up there but I

448
00:17:31,829 --> 00:17:35,639
just fire on saying that he had a u.s.

449
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:38,280
Marine going to cover up there under

450
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:39,150
what authority I'd like to know but I'm

451
00:17:38,279 --> 00:17:40,379
trying to dig into that

452
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:42,660
I thought they couldn't use the military

453
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:45,090
in law enforcement here in the United

454
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:46,980
States I don't see how they could send

455
00:17:45,089 --> 00:17:49,319
them into Vancouver at the different

456
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:50,819
country so Marines are invading Mandy

457
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:52,139
has a different country so up there

458
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:54,509
maybe they're Marie you know they'll

459
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:56,190
they somehow I try and claim if they're

460
00:17:54,509 --> 00:17:59,119
undermined the US military or something

461
00:17:56,190 --> 00:18:02,190
by smelling selling cannabis to folks

462
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:03,689
I'm not quite sure I mean do you think

463
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:05,400
that you know they be up there undermine

464
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:07,590
the US military by selling cannabis to

465
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:11,750
people or I think they'd be undermining

466
00:18:07,589 --> 00:18:11,750
the US Army your marine corps and

467
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:19,730
undermine that mindset that this is evil

468
00:18:16,339 --> 00:18:23,730
well strange thing about it is that

469
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:25,890
cannabis has been used not only as a

470
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:29,539
food product but also as a medical

471
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:32,580
product for perhaps 5,000 years and

472
00:18:29,539 --> 00:18:36,839
Thomas Jefferson and George Washington

473
00:18:32,579 --> 00:18:40,259
grew cannabis in the early days of this

474
00:18:36,839 --> 00:18:43,909
country it was mostly used for making a

475
00:18:40,259 --> 00:18:46,440
rope and cloth at the same time I'll bet

476
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:50,160
some of those dudes were smoking some of

477
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:54,870
this stuff because it had been smoked

478
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:57,808
for thousands of years in Asia you know

479
00:18:54,869 --> 00:19:00,149
there's a paper in Jefferson's papers

480
00:18:57,808 --> 00:19:04,230
from governor Morris governor Morris

481
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:05,490
according to James Madison Madison who

482
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:08,670
weakens called father of the

483
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:10,740
Constitution wrote that the the stock

484
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:12,779
quote the style and finish of the US

485
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:16,130
Constitution properly belongs to the pen

486
00:19:12,779 --> 00:19:19,349
of governor Morris in quote and Morris

487
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:21,690
while he was the ambassador to France

488
00:19:19,349 --> 00:19:21,990
just following up after Jefferson was

489
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:24,570
amp

490
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:25,859
to France while Jefferson was Secretary

491
00:19:24,569 --> 00:19:29,428
of State for Washington

492
00:19:25,859 --> 00:19:32,639
Morris sent this paper called notes

493
00:19:29,429 --> 00:19:35,280
respecting tobacco to Jefferson that he

494
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:38,280
wrote for publication in France and in

495
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:41,308
that paper he compared tobacco and

496
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:44,039
cannabis and he had the paper was

497
00:19:41,308 --> 00:19:47,099
actually discouraging the cultivation of

498
00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:49,170
tobacco by the French but he compared to

499
00:19:47,099 --> 00:19:51,689
backhoe and cannabis and said they

500
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:54,240
called it Indian him he said hip is at

501
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:55,740
all times to be preferred in a populous

502
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:59,339
country I don't know why they were

503
00:19:55,740 --> 00:20:02,759
comparing tobacco in cannabis but you

504
00:19:59,339 --> 00:20:04,740
know I have my bias toward thinking it's

505
00:20:02,759 --> 00:20:07,558
because they were both smoked but I

506
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:10,099
don't think anything that I found anyway

507
00:20:07,558 --> 00:20:12,629
verifies that but it's an interesting

508
00:20:10,099 --> 00:20:14,939
follow up on your comment about

509
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:17,370
Jefferson and watching it yeah I'm sure

510
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:21,420
you know for very least because both

511
00:20:17,369 --> 00:20:23,189
were were grown in us and the other both

512
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:24,779
were trying to you have us was trying to

513
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:27,900
make sure that they could succeed

514
00:20:24,779 --> 00:20:29,910
financially as a country the galatea

515
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:32,190
were you know cut off from Britain and

516
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:33,690
were on their own I was independent

517
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:35,490
country they had like something you know

518
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:37,140
some of the trades so things that need

519
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:38,429
to import because then you gotta

520
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:40,890
remember you know it's not like today

521
00:20:38,429 --> 00:20:43,559
where the US is a giant financial power

522
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:45,860
back then the US wasn't that big

523
00:20:43,558 --> 00:20:48,359
advantages over backwater colonial

524
00:20:45,859 --> 00:20:50,099
outpost you know at that time you know I

525
00:20:48,359 --> 00:20:52,109
mean Britain and France were it in the

526
00:20:50,099 --> 00:20:55,469
world far as financial power is then

527
00:20:52,109 --> 00:20:57,178
probably you know its heart of the

528
00:20:55,470 --> 00:21:02,970
Austrian Empire was maybe third

529
00:20:57,179 --> 00:21:06,179
somewhere there the Russian Empire so in

530
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:09,769
fact in the American colonies prior to

531
00:21:06,179 --> 00:21:13,350
independence the British required that

532
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:16,200
all colonists who had 40 acres or more

533
00:21:13,349 --> 00:21:19,230
of land had to put 10% of their land

534
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:22,890
under cultivation for him and that 10%

535
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:24,990
of hemp cultivation was their taxes that

536
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:26,640
was how they paid their taxes what the

537
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:28,829
British would do is they'd take that

538
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,590
hill and they'd use it to make the sales

539
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:31,869
in the

540
00:21:29,589 --> 00:21:34,119
for their ships and they'd also create

541
00:21:31,869 --> 00:21:35,739
what we call oakum which is the clock

542
00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:38,199
that went between the boards to make

543
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:41,200
sure the water didn't seep in when they

544
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:44,769
were out at sea so they found that him

545
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:47,380
rigging and sails lasted three times

546
00:21:44,769 --> 00:21:51,490
longer than any alternatives such as

547
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:53,350
cotton so if you're at sea for six

548
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:57,250
months in your sails fall apart you're

549
00:21:53,349 --> 00:22:00,099
in big trouble I'm rather surprised to

550
00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:04,029
hear that okema suit was made out of

551
00:22:00,099 --> 00:22:08,529
hemp because during World War two

552
00:22:04,029 --> 00:22:13,210
I worked in shipyards and they were

553
00:22:08,529 --> 00:22:16,329
making budges and they were driving

554
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:19,329
oakum into the seams between the boards

555
00:22:16,329 --> 00:22:23,799
and then they would seal them with Chris

556
00:22:19,329 --> 00:22:26,859
oak pitch but the strange thing about it

557
00:22:23,799 --> 00:22:29,889
is that the oakum had the odor of

558
00:22:26,859 --> 00:22:31,990
creosote and I didn't know where the

559
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:35,380
stuff came from I I wouldn't be

560
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:38,230
surprised of it if it was Canopus him at

561
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:39,670
all but yeah just like he said I didn't

562
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:47,380
know what that stuff was but I don't

563
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:49,420
think anybody was well what we use this

564
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:52,630
stuff for because it had this Krita soda

565
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:55,150
on it is we used to put it in the in the

566
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:58,600
band of our hats to keep the mosquitoes

567
00:22:55,150 --> 00:23:01,690
away because of the Chris Opitz that had

568
00:22:58,599 --> 00:23:05,740
on it and that worked real great that's

569
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:08,860
interesting you know you're a world war

570
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:10,420
two veteran you walked into Germany I

571
00:23:08,859 --> 00:23:13,000
think for several months you said on

572
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:16,980
some of our previous shows then after

573
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,980
that you went to medical school and

574
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:21,549
started your medical career here at the

575
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:24,190
University of Oregon Medical School

576
00:23:21,549 --> 00:23:27,549
that's correct yes yes I taught in

577
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:30,279
medical schools for 22 years and I

578
00:23:27,549 --> 00:23:33,639
practice medicine outside for another 10

579
00:23:30,279 --> 00:23:35,259
years these folks here won't brag about

580
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:38,200
themselves as much as I think they

581
00:23:35,259 --> 00:23:40,589
should but doctor Levesque is a retired

582
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:42,360
professor of pharmacology and toxicology

583
00:23:40,589 --> 00:23:46,019
all Loney

584
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:47,369
is an attorney and you were to secretary

585
00:23:46,019 --> 00:23:49,079
the Green Party I believe are the

586
00:23:47,369 --> 00:23:51,029
Pacific part now they're the Pacific

587
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:53,819
greens Dobbs the greens correct right

588
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:56,579
and president of the Oregon Wildlife

589
00:23:53,819 --> 00:24:01,319
Federation so I would should probably

590
00:23:56,579 --> 00:24:03,839
throw in that those other groups are not

591
00:24:01,319 --> 00:24:06,750
affiliated and don't necessarily agree

592
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:08,819
with the points of our TV show cannabis

593
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:09,210
common sense but I thought I are maybe

594
00:24:08,819 --> 00:24:11,579
they do

595
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:14,579
vitamin that's I thought I'd mentioned

596
00:24:11,579 --> 00:24:17,519
that yeah that's good I mean I know in

597
00:24:14,579 --> 00:24:20,669
the past the the Pacific Party which is

598
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:23,579
now said that greens has endorsed the

599
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:27,210
past versions of the cameras Tax Act and

600
00:24:23,579 --> 00:24:29,250
in May at the May convention for the

601
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:31,710
Pacific greens they're going to take up

602
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:34,589
the endorsement of the new cams Tax Act

603
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:36,180
the one for the year 2000 which we need

604
00:24:34,589 --> 00:24:38,399
what does it call me senators we need

605
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:41,430
for that one sixty six thousand seven

606
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:43,620
hundred and forty eight valid registered

607
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:45,779
Oregon voters signatures are needed and

608
00:24:43,619 --> 00:24:47,459
that's ten and a half percent less than

609
00:24:45,779 --> 00:24:49,440
we're needed over the last four years

610
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:53,190
that's because of the low turnout in the

611
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:55,200
Guba toriel race last November 1998 so

612
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:57,390
we need a buffer though more than the

613
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:00,360
court out about thirty percent so we

614
00:24:57,390 --> 00:25:03,690
need to turn in roughly ninety to ninety

615
00:25:00,359 --> 00:25:06,149
five thousand registered Oregon voters

616
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:07,799
signatures to ensure qualification well

617
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:09,990
yeah when I'm sorry for is that we have

618
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:11,869
a hundred thousand signatures when we

619
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:13,950
turn in hundred thousand draw signatures

620
00:25:11,869 --> 00:25:15,929
ones that we've gone through and

621
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:17,490
obviously you know get that rid of the

622
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:19,890
ones that are people to turn out

623
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:21,839
correctly in Rock County whatever not

624
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:23,910
completely five hundred thousand draw

625
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:26,339
signatures and I think they'll take us

626
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:28,019
there and I think that's a viable goal

627
00:25:26,339 --> 00:25:30,359
it's a good number to keep on our heads

628
00:25:28,019 --> 00:25:33,180
to keep that positive focus that people

629
00:25:30,359 --> 00:25:35,339
talk about to think positive and I can

630
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:37,650
say you know and make your teeth Pacific

631
00:25:35,339 --> 00:25:39,259
green part we'll be voting on it to

632
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:41,960
endorse well in what

633
00:25:39,259 --> 00:25:44,929
I know the American in that prohibition

634
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:47,289
Lee has endorsed you know the octa for

635
00:25:44,929 --> 00:25:49,820
the year 2000 and I'm sure you know

636
00:25:47,289 --> 00:25:50,750
other groups are lining up right now as

637
00:25:49,819 --> 00:25:53,899
we speak

638
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:56,660
as is being aired to endorses exactly

639
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:58,820
you know last year we met with the

640
00:25:56,660 --> 00:26:03,380
Oregon retail liquor Association and

641
00:25:58,819 --> 00:26:07,099
they voted 17 to 8 to endorse ACTA if we

642
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:08,840
put in a clause that would guarantee

643
00:26:07,099 --> 00:26:11,449
them a certain percentage so we've done

644
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:13,039
that we've given them a 15% Commission

645
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:15,048
on their sales I think that's a

646
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:18,379
reasonable Commission it's not too high

647
00:26:15,048 --> 00:26:20,750
or too low and so we're hoping that

648
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:23,000
they're going to vote again to reinforce

649
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:25,490
our initiative the libertarian party I

650
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,900
want to remind viewers it's kind of live

651
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:29,480
later than we normally give this plug

652
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:31,429
but please call us please call us and

653
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:33,769
let us send you our petition you know

654
00:26:31,429 --> 00:26:35,750
the Oregon cannabis Tax Act petition

655
00:26:33,769 --> 00:26:38,929
will tax and regulate the sale of

656
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:41,960
marijuana to adults in Oregon State

657
00:26:38,929 --> 00:26:44,360
liquor stores it will license farmers to

658
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:46,190
grow the drug for sales the Oregon

659

660
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:51,380
Liquor Control Commission will place it

661
00:26:48,048 --> 00:26:54,019
in pharmacies in Oregon and potentially

662
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:56,780
other states at cost where it won't be

663
00:26:54,019 --> 00:26:59,119
taxed but then the sales to adults over

664
00:26:56,779 --> 00:27:01,579
the age of 21 through state liquor

665
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:04,339
stores will be taxed will also allow

666
00:27:01,579 --> 00:27:06,889
adults to grow their own and the sales

667
00:27:04,339 --> 00:27:10,099
of all strains and seeds and stocks of

668
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:11,660
cannabis will not be regulated finally

669
00:27:10,099 --> 00:27:14,449
it will also allow farmers without a

670
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:19,360
license to cultivate industrial hemp for

671
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:22,490
canvas Road laced linen and all the

672
00:27:19,359 --> 00:27:26,359
50,000 plus products that industrial

673
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:28,009
hemp can produce and just in closing I

674
00:27:26,359 --> 00:27:30,740
think we'll talk about it some more in a

675
00:27:28,009 --> 00:27:32,960
future show but in North Dakota they

676
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:36,769
just North Dakota has become the first

677
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:39,558
state to legalize industrial hemp so let

678
