1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,379
good afternoon my name is Jennifer

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:06,509
Valley and I'm here to encourage all of

3
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:09,719
you to become involved in the healthcare

4
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:12,480
discussion reality is medical marijuana

5
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:15,000
is the most significant and important

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,310
health care program Oregon offers and

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,789
it's being completely ignored by the

8
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:23,219
healthcare transformation Oregon Health

9
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:25,800
Authority is the program that runs

10
00:00:23,219 --> 00:00:29,038
Oregon Medical Marijuana Program and

11
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:32,070
they have meetings every week sometimes

12
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:34,109
three or five of them no one person can

13
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:36,119
get to them all some of them are

14
00:00:34,109 --> 00:00:38,869
downtown Portland some of them are in

15
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:42,419
Salem some of them are in wilsonville

16
00:00:38,869 --> 00:00:44,669
but the reality is we all need to be

17
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:47,129
there we need to be there telling our

18
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:49,649
stories we need to make it clear to them

19
00:00:47,128 --> 00:00:52,738
that the war on drugs is not doing as

20
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:55,620
much good for us as it is bad for us I

21
00:00:52,738 --> 00:00:57,689
had my cancer ignored by my doctor for

22
00:00:55,619 --> 00:00:59,729
four years because she was too busy

23
00:00:57,689 --> 00:01:02,599
worrying about the fact that I smoked

24
00:00:59,729 --> 00:01:05,819
pot to practice medicine in my exam room

25
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:08,368
I'm sure I'm not the only person with

26
00:01:05,819 --> 00:01:10,408
this kind of story and we all need to be

27
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:14,340
telling the Oregon Health Authority our

28
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:16,439
stories it's our community we need to be

29
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:18,450
part of it and they're the ones who run

30
00:01:16,438 --> 00:01:20,789
the medical marijuana program they're

31
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:22,680
the ones who need to be educated so I

32
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:25,110
encourage you all to look up oregon

33
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:27,509
health authorities calendar and go down

34
00:01:25,109 --> 00:01:29,549
and hit a couple of their meetings hit a

35
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:32,009
bunch of their meetings send them

36
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:35,490
letters whatever you can do to make your

37
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:37,769
voice heard now is the time because

38
00:01:35,489 --> 00:01:40,048
right now they're getting ready for the

39
00:01:37,769 --> 00:01:42,840
20 sit for the next session so if you

40
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:45,509
want bills for us instead of only bills

41
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,880
against us we need to be there set in

42
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:51,180
the platform and telling them what we

43
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:53,359
want and now's our opportunity thank you

44
