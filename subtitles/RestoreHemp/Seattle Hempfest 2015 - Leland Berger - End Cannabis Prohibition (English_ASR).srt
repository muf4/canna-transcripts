1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,509

2
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:09,120
many of us have disagreements with each

3
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:13,769
other about that but there's too few of

4
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:16,259
us to be divided more love less attitude

5
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:18,359
okay Seattle can you give us some of

6
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:21,570
that please so we can move forward

7
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:24,210
together and finish the work so nobody

8
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:25,920
gets fired from their job just because

9
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:32,099
they're a consumer nobody has denied

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:33,929

11
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:36,209
have to if we have to end can't a

12
00:00:33,929 --> 00:00:38,460
bigotry and the way to do that is to

13
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:40,980
come out of the closet is the top two

14
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:43,469
people is to let them know listen I'm

15
00:00:40,979 --> 00:00:47,729

16
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:51,390

17
00:00:47,729 --> 00:00:53,339
people consume out all responsibly I can

18
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:56,899

19
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:56,899
to have that conversation

20
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:02,760
