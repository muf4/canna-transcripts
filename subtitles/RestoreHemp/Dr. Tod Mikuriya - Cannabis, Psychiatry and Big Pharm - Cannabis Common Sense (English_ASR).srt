1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:08,519
we roughly estimate that about a third

2
00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:10,370
of the people are receiving letters of

3
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:15,298
recommendation and approval for

4
00:00:10,369 --> 00:00:20,299
primarily emotional or mental problems

5
00:00:15,298 --> 00:00:25,379
and that cannabis is a unique

6
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:29,660
psychotropic in this context in that it

7
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:33,450
has effects on both cognition and affect

8
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:36,780
that also are inextricably connected

9
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:42,050
with any different kinds of physical

10
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:45,450
functioning for example with anorexia

11
00:00:42,049 --> 00:00:49,169
people get inadequate nutrition because

12
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:54,239
of their anxiety causing a suppression

13
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:57,439
of the appetite and that when they

14
00:00:54,238 --> 00:01:03,149
receive cannabis the nutrition is

15
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:08,069
improved because the peristalsis and the

16
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:13,409
spasm the spasm is relieved peristalsis

17
00:01:08,069 --> 00:01:16,438
is promoted so also evacuation which

18
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:21,860
then produces improved mood and improved

19
00:01:16,438 --> 00:01:24,899
functioning with regard to cognition

20
00:01:21,859 --> 00:01:26,879
this also includes the people with

21
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:29,969
thought disorders and you might find

22
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:32,879
this kind of unusual but there are

23
00:01:29,969 --> 00:01:37,728
certain aspects of cognitive functioning

24
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:40,519
that cannabis helps like suppressing or

25
00:01:37,728 --> 00:01:43,709
decreasing obsessive thinking and also

26
00:01:40,519 --> 00:01:49,099
paranoid ideation and paranoid

27
00:01:43,709 --> 00:01:53,548
delusional thought interestingly the

28
00:01:49,099 --> 00:01:57,030
short-term memory-loss people experience

29
00:01:53,549 --> 00:02:01,290
when they acutely medicate with usually

30
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:04,239
inhaled cannabis they can't hold a

31
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:06,118
paranoid delusion long

32
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:08,978
and the same goes for

33
00:02:06,118 --> 00:02:12,370
obsessive-compulsive disorder because

34
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:18,480
they can't keep up this string of

35
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:24,370
pathologic associations also the

36
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:27,848
modulation of effect also affects the

37
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:31,180
cognitive behavior with decreased

38
00:02:27,848 --> 00:02:37,149
anxiety this decreases the pressure for

39
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:41,049
this abnormal type of thought I believe

40
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:45,790
that a new category is warranted the

41
00:02:41,049 --> 00:02:47,379
cannabis fits and that's easement if you

42
00:02:45,789 --> 00:02:49,719
look that up in the dictionary you'll

43
00:02:47,379 --> 00:02:53,590
see several meanings and one of the main

44
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:59,469
meanings is giving ease not the property

45
00:02:53,590 --> 00:03:02,080
legalistic kind of the passage or going

46
00:02:59,469 --> 00:03:06,879
on to some property and getting certain

47
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:11,439
rights but easement as a calming effect

48
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:15,879
and this is what I believe cannabis more

49
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:18,549
closely approximates it's not the same

50
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:24,340
as a benzodiazepine which produces

51
00:03:18,549 --> 00:03:27,099
sedation and ironically depression Allah

52
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:31,469
there is no free lunch pharmacologically

53
00:03:27,099 --> 00:03:33,818
so people do not like the

54
00:03:31,469 --> 00:03:36,299
benzodiazepines and other sedatives for

55
00:03:33,818 --> 00:03:43,810
these kinds of reasons and cannabis

56
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:48,189
helps restore emotional response civet e

57
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:51,729
in a normal way and this also goes along

58
00:03:48,189 --> 00:03:55,349
with people with their paranoid ideation

59
00:03:51,729 --> 00:04:00,009
and disturbance of interpersonal

60
00:03:55,349 --> 00:04:03,519
relationships with certain people with

61
00:04:00,009 --> 00:04:07,298
thought disorder they note that they are

62
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:10,269
more able to relate to others which then

63
00:04:07,299 --> 00:04:13,000
improves their self esteem and their

64
00:04:10,269 --> 00:04:14,500
social functioning in there you're never

65
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,410
going to find this written anywhere

66
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:19,689
because of the

67
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:23,590
the psychiatric literature being

68
00:04:19,689 --> 00:04:29,529
horribly biased and I've looked through

69
00:04:23,589 --> 00:04:34,409
the APA publications going back maybe 70

70
00:04:29,529 --> 00:04:38,199
years and it all is painted with the

71
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:41,260
anti-social element and causing calling

72
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:43,500
it the dysfunctionality or character

73
00:04:41,259 --> 00:04:48,879
defect or other kinds of pejorative

74
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:54,250
condemnatory terms and it's all bill

75
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:56,139
pushing it's all medication and to that

76
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:58,420
end we really don't know what is

77
00:04:56,139 --> 00:05:01,449
happening and this extends not just to

78
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:05,319
psychotropics but I'm going to read you

79
00:05:01,449 --> 00:05:07,060
a short letter to John a kitzhaber MD

80
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:10,719
director Center for evidence-based

81
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:14,110
policy mmm Oregon Health and Science

82
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:16,480
University and this is who I suggest if

83
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:20,410
you want to contact to embarrass a

84
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:22,300
little bit on February 25th I happen to

85
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:24,880
view a panel presentation by your

86
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:26,439
organization on c-span on the cost

87
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:32,339
benefits study of different

88
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:32,339
pharmaceuticals contracted by AARP the

89
00:05:33,149 --> 00:05:40,329
sum total of that that panel was they

90
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:44,560
could not develop any cost benefits

91
00:05:40,329 --> 00:05:46,659
analyses because in analyzing in the

92
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,759
pharmaceutical literature they

93
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:52,110
discovered it was all promotional rather

94
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:56,620
than objective and scientific so

95
00:05:52,110 --> 00:06:01,449
everything masquerading as science is

96
00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:03,189
not so based upon California clinical

97
00:06:01,449 --> 00:06:05,979
experience with a range of chronic

98
00:06:03,189 --> 00:06:08,379
conditions our findings indicating the

99
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:10,629
significant advantage over other

100
00:06:08,379 --> 00:06:13,360
pharmaceuticals conventionally utilized

101
00:06:10,629 --> 00:06:17,168
because of improved quality of life and

102
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:19,780
fewer adverse effects consequently we

103
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:23,060
request the opportunity to discuss our

104
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:25,729
findings with you attached is

105
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:32,509
a list of conditions and guess what the

106
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:35,389
response was so I'm glad this is going

107
00:06:32,509 --> 00:06:37,849
over to cable TV in the Portland area

108
00:06:35,389 --> 00:06:41,090
and hopefully on some of the out there

109
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:43,030
and the viewing audience and can give

110
00:06:41,089 --> 00:06:46,549
the senator a call and ask them to

111
00:06:43,029 --> 00:06:48,799
include cannabis and their studies and

112
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:52,250
especially about the mental health issue

113
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:54,490
I would be fascinated to hear the

114
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:57,079
response but I won't hold my breath

115
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:58,970
may I interject just very briefly

116
00:06:57,079 --> 00:07:01,099
there's research I'm sure you guys are

117
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:03,650
all aware of about the synergistic

118
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:05,570
effects of the receptor effects of

119
00:07:03,649 --> 00:07:07,609
opiates and cannabinoids where they

120
00:07:05,569 --> 00:07:10,339
basically are hitchhiking with each

121
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:13,460
other and small much smaller doses of

122
00:07:10,339 --> 00:07:15,500
both medications create the same benefit

123
00:07:13,459 --> 00:07:18,019
with of course much less side effects so

124
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:21,110
these are really remarkable findings and

125
00:07:18,019 --> 00:07:23,349
and I really regret that there aren't

126
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:25,610
physicians who are just monitoring the

127
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:28,340
reduction in the prescription patterns

128
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:31,629
of their patients if they doubt that

129
00:07:28,339 --> 00:07:35,839
cannabis is useful you think that's new

130
00:07:31,629 --> 00:07:39,228
if you read marijuana medical papers in

131
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:44,929
the Ohio State Medical Society meeting

132
00:07:39,228 --> 00:07:49,250
on cannabis in 1860 a doctor from

133
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:51,620
deliver from Ohio reported that using an

134
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:54,410
alternative alternating courses of

135
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:57,050
opiates and cannabis for treating

136
00:07:54,410 --> 00:08:01,970
chronic condition conditions reduced

137
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:05,060
dependence on opiates 1859 this was

138
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:08,150
written and so you know this is

139
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:12,079
something new now we're talking about

140
00:08:08,149 --> 00:08:14,418
the takeover by big farm and ruining

141
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:17,959
policy through their special interest

142
00:08:14,418 --> 00:08:20,120
money and furthermore the fact that this

143
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:24,799
whole system this MA

144
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:29,879
can I use the my fake oh why not

145
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:33,090
monomolecular mercantile madness this is

146
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:37,710
all patent office driven if you look

147
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:43,950
back to what it was before the single

148
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:48,600
molecule ascended to its role in current

149
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:51,210
commercial medicine you'll see that it's

150
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:53,879
all secondary to what can get patented

151
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:56,670
and then they claim that the newly

152
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:59,490
patented materials increasingly better

153
00:08:56,669 --> 00:09:02,099
blah blah blah but then you see what's

154
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:04,560
happened to the literature it's gotten

155
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:06,300
thoroughly corrupted and perverted so

156
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:10,289
that you don't know what's happening and

157
00:09:06,299 --> 00:09:13,079
here we have now a drug seeking drug

158
00:09:10,289 --> 00:09:16,709
hunger in public convinced they need all

159
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:19,650
sorts of combinations of patentable

160
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:23,550
materials and this and that's really

161
00:09:19,649 --> 00:09:25,740
sickening our society and when they

162
00:09:23,549 --> 00:09:29,159
started directly advertising to the

163
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:35,909
public for psychotropics especially ask

164
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:39,449
your doctor social anxiety disorder all

165
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:46,319
these these kinds of influences to

166
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:48,950
influence you and their bottom line any

167
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,950
other questions
