1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:04,080
I like I think it was G who said first

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,639
they ignore you then they laugh at you

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,960
then they fight you then you win so it

4
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:10,320
seems like we pass the laughter stage

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,440
and people are starting to take cannabis

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,880
a little more seriously that's why you

7
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:14,558
see a lot of documentaries you see a lot

8
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,039
of shows and like you said the slant

9
00:00:14,558 --> 00:00:17,439
because they are going to fight it the

10
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:18,520
slant has kind of changed a little bit

11
00:00:17,439 --> 00:00:20,320
it used to be a little way more

12
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:21,559
open-minded in the first couple years

13
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,960
but the last one they just had on front

14
00:00:21,559 --> 00:00:26,038
line I thought was tilted a little more

15
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:28,920
toward the DEA who was clearly lying

16
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:31,320
than than toward uh an or even balanced

17
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,719
or even more Pro cannabis and ginger so

18
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,320
I think that's the challenge I say to

19
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:37,640
create the good content for that and

20
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:39,359
also I think you know even not just

21
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,799
National programming but uh like local

22
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:42,878
programming I used to do a show called

23
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:44,959
cannabis planet and it came on in Los

24
00:00:42,878 --> 00:00:47,039
Angeles and Sacramento I tell

25
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,160
you I was shocked at the amount of

26
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,800
response that I got from people that I

27
00:00:49,159 --> 00:00:52,799
wouldn't even have thought were pot

28
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:54,519
cannabis users or just people who watch

29
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:55,599
television they're like oh I'll go watch

30
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,480
that show so there's things like that

31
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,239
you can do to spread the word so put

32
00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:01,919
together your own cable access show

33
00:00:59,238 --> 00:01:01,919
that's my advice
