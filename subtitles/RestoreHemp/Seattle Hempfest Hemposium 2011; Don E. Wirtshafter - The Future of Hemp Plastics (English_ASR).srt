1
00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:05,339
yeah that that was done even 20 years

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:06,599
ago I have water pitchers and things we

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:10,679
did

4
00:00:06,599 --> 00:00:13,919
um uh made with 20 40 55 hemp fiber into

5
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:16,379
the uh plastic beads that are used as in

6
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:19,140
these injection molding machines

7
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:22,140
but um most of it turned out pretty

8
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:26,339
brittle the hemp CD cases all of mine

9
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:28,080
are broken apart my hip scale is uh yeah

10
00:00:26,339 --> 00:00:31,198
I think that was electronics and not the

11
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:32,359
hemp that failed there but you know all

12
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,579
these little

13
00:00:32,359 --> 00:00:38,340
tchotchkes got made from this uh because

14
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:41,579
actually it makes your beads cheaper the

15
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:43,140
hemp is cheaper than polyester so they

16
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:45,840
can mix the two together when they're

17
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:48,179
making the beads and it acts it actually

18
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,859
is a pretty good film material and Avail

19
00:00:48,179 --> 00:00:51,238
that technology is available right now

20
00:00:49,859 --> 00:00:54,539
my problem with that is that they're

21
00:00:51,238 --> 00:00:56,099
selling that as hip plastic and hemp

22
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:58,500
plastic is a whole nother thing where

23
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:02,219
you actually take the hemp and and turn

24
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:04,680
it in you know plasticize in it itself

25
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:06,840
and you can do this with him between the

26
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,820
hip fiber the hemp seed oil are these

27
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:11,700
incredible plastic parts very much like

28
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:14,399
Bakelite in the end just from hemp alone

29
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:16,560
and and you add some preference and

30
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,540
things like that you get amazing

31
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,040
fiber things this is going to be our

32
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:22,380
future because these things are

33
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:25,200
biodegradable without killing us you

34
00:01:22,379 --> 00:01:30,079
know and uh and and all those things

35
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,079
we'll learn one of these days to use him
