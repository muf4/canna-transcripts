30
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:13,280
that we're coming out of our cocoons and

31
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:16,118
getting together and expressing

32
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:18,640
ourselves about God's most beautiful

33
00:01:16,118 --> 00:01:21,359
gift to us the beautiful plant that

34
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:24,719
should be our home the clothes we wear

35
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:28,118
well my purse in this case uh and should

36
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:30,640
be is my nutrition that keeps me healthy

37
00:01:28,118 --> 00:01:33,280
not to mention that it is my medicine

38
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:36,040
when my eye pressures go up when I

39
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,759
revisit all injuries that make me not

40
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:41,680
walk so well for the summer that foot

41
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:44,680
goes into tons of marijuana robed on it

42
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:47,040
lots eaten and two months later I'm at

43
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:50,719
the festival and just to get inside here

44
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:54,240
you better know that you better walk

45
00:01:50,718 --> 00:01:57,038
huh it's a challenge it's fun it's all

46
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:59,560
good now you got doors opening

47
00:01:57,039 --> 00:02:02,519
everywhere you have a governor that as

48
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:04,850
he signed the hill which now are the

49
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:06,039
seventh state to have

50
00:02:04,849 --> 00:02:08,840
[Music]

51
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:10,679
it he stated that you know that was a

52
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,959
good thing to do so you they would be

53
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:14,878
oregonians would not be far behind but

54
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,959
ahead of the curve that's coming that's

55
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:21,120
inevitable and I think he said that he

56
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:24,759
expected other aspects of this plant

57
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:28,080
prohibition to end and I think we're all

58
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:31,639
behind that I'm excited that Oregon is

59
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:34,800
thinking of 928 and he's doing U the

60
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:37,318
other initiatives for regulation and

61
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,719
Taxation and he's doing the hemp

62
00:02:37,318 --> 00:02:42,878
initiatives and I will be out there

63
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:46,560
hoping to work with all of you with a

64
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:48,959
big United voice and everything that's

65
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,920
positive about cannabis that gets on the

66
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:54,120
ballot we're going to get out there and

67
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:55,759
we're going to vote for it the meanwhile

68
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,719
I guess it's getting into the ballot

69
00:02:55,759 --> 00:03:00,359
that's important at the stage and I know

70
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:02,560
you will all participate in whichever

71
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,560
initiatives you're most familiar with

72
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:07,199
and want to help the most with I hope

73
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,158
you find time to work with all three and

74
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:11,199
I hope all three make it to the ballot

75
00:03:09,158 --> 00:03:14,239
and I'm really looking forward to that

76
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:16,598
kind of excitement next year the other

77
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:19,439
thing that shouldn't couldn't ought to

78
00:03:16,598 --> 00:03:22,238
be happening now is that because we have

79
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:25,598
doors opening doors are open in

80
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:27,878
Washington DC there is no excuse for a

81
00:03:25,598 --> 00:03:32,679
single one of us not to have contacted

82
00:03:27,878 --> 00:03:34,840
our legislators and express our urgency

83
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:36,680
in wanting to end this hideous

84
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:40,080
prohibition that's

85
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:42,280
unconstitutional immoral and it's AO

86
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,799
against the Creator's work which makes

87
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,799
it a

88
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:51,158
blasphemy to arrest an adult for

89
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:55,359
choosing a wiser but is the epitome of

90
00:03:51,158 --> 00:03:58,399
hypocrisy and we no longer have the time

91
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:01,040
much less the money yeah well whatever

92
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,519
to support such insane

93
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:05,280
your legislators need to express to you

94
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:08,560
that they're not ignorant and they will

95
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,759
change the course of history because as

96
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,158
Jack har says this plant has to be here

97
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:15,078
to

98
00:04:12,158 --> 00:04:17,478
reverse the destruction we have done

99
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:19,600
cutting down all those trees for paper

100
00:04:17,478 --> 00:04:21,560
worthless paper that will disintegrate

101
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:25,160
within a 100 years even if you keep it

102
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:29,160
safe back to the real paper back to the

103
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:32,360
real life cannabis hemp is a reality we

104
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:35,960
will realize I before this decade is

105
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:38,000
over before even the next 5 years and

106
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:40,638
hopefully the next year all over this

107
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,879
country and Oregon can take the lead

108
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:46,240
flag again and show the world how this

109
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:49,240
