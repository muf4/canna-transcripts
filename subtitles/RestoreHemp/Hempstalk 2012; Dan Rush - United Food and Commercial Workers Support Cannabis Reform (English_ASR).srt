80 H I can't hear you is any yeah yeah

24
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,680
we're supporting measure 80 and the

25
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,640
reason we're supporting measure 8 80 is

26
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:11,439
it because it's because it will create

27
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:14,319
jobs anybody here want a union job with

28

30
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:21,319
going to do in this industry and right

31
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,719
now we're working in the medical

32
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:26,919
cannabis and hemp industry but also

33
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:30,879
right now we're here talking about

34
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:35,359
legalization measure 80 initia

35
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:38,599
502 and and measure 64 in Colorado does

36
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:41,239
everybody know about measure 64 and

37
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:43,839
502 tell about it so one of the things

38
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:46,280
that we're doing is we've created a

39
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,880
slogan that we're using in the union and

40
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:52,759
we're going around the country talking

41
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:55,239
about and that is fix it and pass it

42
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:57,959
does everybody know what that means what

43
00:01:55,239 --> 00:02:00,078
that means is that we can't lose any

44
00:01:57,959 --> 00:02:03,158
more Statewide ballots in the United

45
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:06,399
States and when people work as hard as

46
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:08,800
as Paul and Casper and the rest of the

47
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:12,000
folks here that have helped put this put

48
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:14,879
these uh events together we have to step

49
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,360
up and we have to support them in our

50
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:20,318
industry some every initiative has

51
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:23,640
something that people don't like about

52
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:25,919
it and uh and the thing to do is when

53
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:27,878
you find an initiative that's about

54
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:30,958
cannabis if there's something about it

55
00:02:27,878 --> 00:02:34,159
you don't like remember It costs $5

56
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:37,199
million to $10 million to pass something

57
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:40,439
on the ballot but it only cost

58
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:44,598
$500,000 to fix it and that's what we're

59
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:46,959
telling folks pass it and then fix it

60
00:02:44,598 --> 00:02:49,280
don't fight it we have been our own

61
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:52,039
worst enemies in cannabis we've been our

62
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:55,080
own worst enemies in social justice we

63
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:58,280
keep finding one sentence in 300 that we

64
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:01,200
don't like well you know what nothing is

65
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:03,640
perfect and nothing will ever be perfect

66
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:06,439
right now is crucial in politics for

67
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:09,158
cannabis in the United States we need to

68
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:13,519

70
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:19,120
