let's welcome all Stanford welcome to

8
00:01:02,119 --> 00:01:06,859
another exciting edition of cannabis

9
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:08,810
common sense as you may know cannabis

10
00:01:06,859 --> 00:01:11,030
common sense is a production of our

11
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:13,810
political committee campaign for the

12
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:19,280
restoration and regulation of hemp and

that's C rrh for short and if you are

14
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:24,170
aware we are circulating a petition and

15
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:26,989
a referendum at this time the petition

16
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:29,868
our initiative is the Oregon cannabis

17
00:01:26,989 --> 00:01:32,780
Tax Act that would license farmers to

18
00:01:29,868 --> 00:01:35,959
grow the drug marijuana for sale to the

19
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:39,469
olcc the olcc would sell it through its

20
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:41,868
liquor store system and put it in bars

21
00:01:39,469 --> 00:01:44,298
and taverns that got a license to carry

22
00:01:41,868 --> 00:01:48,078
it and it would also put in in

23
00:01:44,299 --> 00:01:49,939
pharmacies at cost it would tax the

24
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:52,250
recreational use of marijuana through

25
00:01:49,938 --> 00:01:54,828
the liquor stores the bars and taverns

26
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:57,799
and smoking establishments but the

27
00:01:54,828 --> 00:01:59,569
marijuana sold through the pharmacies

28
00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:02,240
would not be taxed and that would be

29
00:01:59,569 --> 00:02:05,000
with the doctor's prescription so if

30
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:08,239
you're registered to vote we need you

31
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,879
give us a call get our petitions sign

32
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,709
the petitions sign the referendum the

33
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:16,280
referendum is different from the

34
00:02:12,709 --> 00:02:18,949
initiative it is a legislative bill that

35
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:20,930
the was an enacted by the legislature it

36
00:02:18,949 --> 00:02:23,238
hasn't gone into effect yet it will

37
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:24,920
wreak rimmel eyes a simple possession of

38
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:27,469
under an ounce of marijuana which has

39
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:31,819
been legal here in Oregon for the past

40
00:02:27,469 --> 00:02:35,599
24 years since 1973 and we get enough

41
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:38,060
signatures by early October to put this

42
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:39,019
on the ballot for a vote in November of

43
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:41,870
1998

44
00:02:39,019 --> 00:02:44,509
then the law will not take effect in

45
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:45,710
October of 1997 as it's currently

46
00:02:44,509 --> 00:02:50,060
scheduled to do

47
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:52,400
it will be held in abeyance and its

48
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:55,969
eventual outcome would be decided by the

49
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,500
people in a vote in November 1998 we

50

exactly you know the initiative

72
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:59,960
campaigns in Oregon actually have

73
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:01,750
registered more voters than the

74
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:04,700
Democrats and the Republicans combined

75
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:06,590
so we're out there in the streets

76
00:04:04,699 --> 00:04:08,629
contacting people and registering our

77
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:10,310
constituents and we're trying to get

78
00:04:08,629 --> 00:04:11,960
them out to vote so that will have a

79
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:14,390
bigger impact on the entire political

80
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:17,689
process not just the drug policy to be

81
00:04:14,389 --> 00:04:19,159
well as I tell people they don't when

82
00:04:17,689 --> 00:04:20,930
they if they bust you they don't care

83
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,470
whether you're registered or not that's

84
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:23,720
true

85
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:25,610
so you better be registered then you

86
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:27,890
might be able to have some effect yeah

87
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:29,840
and if you are busted you can still

88
00:04:27,889 --> 00:04:31,250
register to vote you know in other parts

89
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:33,019
of the country you can't register to

90
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:34,490
vote if you've been convicted of a

91
00:04:33,019 --> 00:04:37,370
felony and a lot of people here in

92
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:39,500
Oregon are under the misperception that

93
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:41,750
they can't register to vote some of the

94
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:43,490
people I like to register the most when

95
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:45,050
the amount in the street petitioning are

96
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:48,769
people who don't think they can register

97
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:50,120
to vote because of the laws if you run

98
00:04:48,769 --> 00:04:52,399

99
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:55,490
can't vote and so well yes you can every

100

00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:17,210
well not in jail but when they're on

110
00:05:14,418 --> 00:05:19,308
probation or parole after they've served

111
00:05:17,209 --> 00:05:21,918
their time and done their debt to

112
00:05:19,309 --> 00:05:23,960
society they can register and vote and

113
00:05:21,918 --> 00:05:25,968
should do so they're going to be

114
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:29,209
affected by laws they must they should

115
00:05:25,968 --> 00:05:32,990
have definitely a say in producing them

116
00:05:29,209 --> 00:05:34,489
mm-hmm so give us a call if you have

117

own home Brenner assuming you have an

120

inkjet printer or with waterproofing or

121
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:46,008
a laser printer you can just print them

122
00:05:44,449 --> 00:05:47,538
right there in your home you don't even

123
00:05:46,009 --> 00:05:55,189
have to wait for us to send them to you

124
00:05:47,538 --> 00:05:57,889
our web address is w wh o RG no Donna

125
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:59,718
you've been a member of a local club

126
00:05:57,889 --> 00:06:01,689
called the alternative health center

127
00:05:59,718 --> 00:06:05,389
that's right and that's a club that

128
00:06:01,689 --> 00:06:08,539
allows the medicinal access to marijuana

129
00:06:05,389 --> 00:06:10,819
and even though it's illegal currently

130
00:06:08,538 --> 00:06:12,318
the people who are running the club and

131
00:06:10,819 --> 00:06:13,968
you're not really involved on that level

132
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:16,218
but the people who are running the club

133
00:06:13,968 --> 00:06:19,060
are taking a great risk to themselves I

134
00:06:16,218 --> 00:06:22,668
think oh they certainly are I mean

135
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:24,338
running the club you are as far as the

136
00:06:22,668 --> 00:06:27,528
police are concerned you're distributing

137
00:06:24,338 --> 00:06:29,300
and they could be arrested for

138
00:06:27,528 --> 00:06:32,899
distribution but they believe that it's

139
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:34,939
so important to get marijuana to people

140
00:06:32,899 --> 00:06:37,129
who need it that it's worth running that

141
00:06:34,939 --> 00:06:39,528
risk and they're running that risk every

142
00:06:37,129 --> 00:06:41,088
day and as are their patients I know

143
00:06:39,528 --> 00:06:43,370
quite a lot of the patients at the

144
00:06:41,088 --> 00:06:46,009
alternative health center and your heart

145
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:49,939
goes out to these people I mean a lot of

146
00:06:46,009 --> 00:06:52,449
them have cancer are been chemotherapy

147
00:06:49,939 --> 00:06:55,310
they've lost their hair they've lost

148
00:06:52,449 --> 00:06:58,069
I've met a man the other day who just

149
00:06:55,310 --> 00:07:00,620
had who had just had his his arm removed

150
00:06:58,069 --> 00:07:05,389
two weeks previously because he had had

151
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:08,209
cancer in the bone right here a lot of

152
00:07:05,389 --> 00:07:10,278
people with AIDS are there who are

153
00:07:08,209 --> 00:07:11,110
taking you know people with AIDS take a

154
00:07:10,278 --> 00:07:14,139
real

155
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:16,598
large number of drugs the new Proteus

156
00:07:14,139 --> 00:07:18,848
inhibitors evidently are doing a

157
00:07:16,598 --> 00:07:21,189
wonderful thing about their effect on

158
00:07:18,848 --> 00:07:24,728
the AIDS virus but they also make people

159
00:07:21,189 --> 00:07:28,598
really sick and it can't eat they can't

160
00:07:24,728 --> 00:07:31,120
eat one is wait right you can you can

161
00:07:28,598 --> 00:07:32,889
die from that too right they call that

162
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:36,430
the wasting syndrome from people who

163
00:07:32,889 --> 00:07:39,158
have AIDS and many AIDS patients say the

164
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:41,530
only thing that helps keep them alive

165
00:07:39,158 --> 00:07:45,389
where they can increase their appetite

166
00:07:41,529 --> 00:07:47,939
is by using cannabis in marijuana to

167
00:07:45,389 --> 00:07:49,930
combat the wasting syndrome that

168
00:07:47,939 --> 00:07:54,009
companies the use of all those

169
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:56,079
pharmaceutical drugs and it's also on

170
00:07:54,009 --> 00:07:58,530
appetite stimulator for people who are

171
00:07:56,079 --> 00:08:01,568
undergoing chemotherapy with can zoo

172
00:07:58,529 --> 00:08:06,369
people who are undergoing cancer

173
00:08:01,569 --> 00:08:08,439
treatment find that by using marijuana

174
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:10,870
it stimulates their appetite for that

175
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:12,129
week after chemotherapy when they can't

176
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:14,139
keep anything down

177
00:08:12,129 --> 00:08:16,150
it stops nausea mm-hmm now there are

178
00:08:14,139 --> 00:08:19,259
several different medicinal products in

179
00:08:16,149 --> 00:08:22,468
cannabis there's THC

180
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:26,050
tetrahydrocannabinol THC is the

181
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:29,199
substance that combats nausea it stops

182
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:32,620
nausea increases appetite lowers inter

183
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:34,750
ocular pressure there are other and it's

184
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:37,599
actually available pharmaceutically but

185
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:39,599
for oral that's not all right that's

186
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:42,250
Marinol and it's available

187
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,899
pharmaceutically but taking it orally is

188
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:46,600
really difficult if you're nauseous

189
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:48,730
really you'll throw up three or four of

190
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:51,579
them and those pills are not cheap yes

191
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:53,409
I'm very elusive cost six dollars and

192
00:08:51,578 --> 00:08:56,439
the big ones cost eighteen or twenty oh

193
00:08:53,409 --> 00:09:00,730
my god and you throw up three or four

194
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:02,560
$20 pills you're you better you're you

195
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:05,490
better either be rich or have a good

196
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:08,948
health insurance that's for sure and

197
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:11,948
unfortunately in the case of a lot of

198
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:14,259
people they don't have that so but they

199
00:09:11,948 --> 00:09:17,740
find it by just taking two or three

200
00:09:14,259 --> 00:09:20,019
puffs of good marijuana that they're

201
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:22,389
able to keep food down they're able to

202
00:09:20,019 --> 00:09:24,669
keep liquids down and they're not

203
00:09:22,389 --> 00:09:27,639
throwing up and that's what THC

204
00:09:24,669 --> 00:09:30,789
does and lowers inter ocular pressure

205
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:33,039
it's probably the most psychoactive

206
00:09:30,789 --> 00:09:35,439
ingredient in cannabis as well

207
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:40,419
now there's another constituent of

208
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:44,770
cannabis cannabis all and that is CBD

209
00:09:40,419 --> 00:09:47,769
and CBD is just slightly psychoactive

210
00:09:44,769 --> 00:09:50,439
not so much as THC and it is an anti

211
00:09:47,769 --> 00:09:52,929
[ __ ] agent so people who have

212
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:57,160
multiple sclerosis find that that

213
00:09:52,929 --> 00:09:59,649
portion of the chemical mix in marijuana

214
00:09:57,159 --> 00:10:03,399
that helps them and people who have

215
00:09:59,649 --> 00:10:06,759
multiple sclerosis anything that causes

216
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:09,220
them to go into spasms they find that

217
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:11,350
use of CBD is very useful but that is

218
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:13,629
not pharmaceutically available it's only

219
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:17,560
available in the black market there's

220
00:10:13,629 --> 00:10:20,470
also one other constituent of Kavanagh

221
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:25,149
of cannabis or marijuana and that's

222
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:30,120
cannabic Romi Mar CBC CBC is not

223
00:10:25,149 --> 00:10:34,000
psychoactive at all but it has an anti

224
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:36,730
infection property it's lowers

225
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:40,899
temperatures for some people it stops

226
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:43,659
the onset of fever and has some other

227
00:10:40,899 --> 00:10:45,819
medicinal properties so cannabis isn't

228
00:10:43,659 --> 00:10:47,169
just one or two constituents it's a

229
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:48,850
variety of them and a lot of them have

230
00:10:47,169 --> 00:10:51,969
different medical effects that's true I

231
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:54,040
know several patients who either have

232
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:57,910
multiple sclerosis or in are in

233
00:10:54,039 --> 00:11:02,439
wheelchairs or have had injuries and are

234
00:10:57,909 --> 00:11:04,089
paralyzed from wherever down one person

235
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:07,600
I know particularly is paralyzed from

236
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:10,600
the waist down he says that if you are

237
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:13,060
in this situation you have spasms in

238
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:15,759
your limbs that you cannot control and

239
00:11:13,059 --> 00:11:19,299
also that pain can suddenly strike

240
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:22,389
anywhere evidently if you interfere with

241
00:11:19,299 --> 00:11:23,949
the spinal cord you have no control over

242
00:11:22,389 --> 00:11:27,819
what the nerves are going to be doing

243
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:31,180
and that smoking marijuana he said is

244
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:33,760
better than any drug he'd ever taken for

245
00:11:31,179 --> 00:11:36,969
me for for both calming the spasms and

246
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:38,139
for making the pain go away yeah you

247
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:39,910
know we at

248
00:11:38,139 --> 00:11:42,580
the campaign for the restoration

249
00:11:39,909 --> 00:11:44,620
regulation of him are not involved with

250
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:45,580
the alternative health center the club

251
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:47,289
here in Portland

252
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:49,240
there are also clubs in other parts of

253
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:52,179
the country especially in California now

254
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:55,028
with the passage of proposition 215 that

255
00:11:52,179 --> 00:11:59,289
allowed medical marijuana down there but

256
00:11:55,028 --> 00:12:02,169
we refer people that asked about it to

257
00:11:59,289 --> 00:12:05,139
the club and we don't have a problem

258
00:12:02,169 --> 00:12:08,740
with that we are happy to see a patient

259
00:12:05,139 --> 00:12:12,610
that needs this to have access to this

260
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:15,220
medicine and we wonder why the state has

261
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:17,709
imposed itself between the doctor and

262
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:20,139
the patient which would you prefer to

263
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:23,018
decide your medical issue should it be

264
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:26,259
your doctor should it be you personally

265
00:12:23,019 --> 00:12:28,480
or should it be the police officer who

266
00:12:26,259 --> 00:12:31,028
wants to seize your property because you

267
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,589
might own a house I think the answer is

268
00:12:31,028 --> 00:12:34,720
pretty clear you know with the

269
00:12:32,589 --> 00:12:36,399
recrimination of marijuana bill that's

270
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:40,810
passed that we're circulating a petition

271
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:42,250
to try to stop the police said that the

272
00:12:40,809 --> 00:12:44,799
Maine that this was their number one

273
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:46,778
priority the top priority that they had

274
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:48,519
with all the murderers and rapists and

275
00:12:46,778 --> 00:12:50,259
thieves out there they're making this

276
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:57,250
their top priority they solve this

277
00:12:50,259 --> 00:12:59,588
problem Oh Robert oh my god yeah we know

278
00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:00,879
arson here and there we know here in

279
00:12:59,589 --> 00:13:03,160
Portland that if you have your house

280
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:05,049
robbed or your car stolen police don't

281
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:08,559
even visit you anymore they send you a

282
00:13:05,049 --> 00:13:10,629
form in the mail so they they say that

283
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:12,309
this is their top priority and that the

284
00:13:10,629 --> 00:13:13,769
real reason they want to do this even

285
00:13:12,309 --> 00:13:16,750
according to the governor of the state

286
00:13:13,769 --> 00:13:18,819
when he issued a press release was so

287
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:21,070
that he could expand the powers of

288
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:23,589
police search and seizure he said that

289
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:26,290
this has less to do with marijuana as it

290
00:13:23,589 --> 00:13:28,120
does with expanding the powers of police

291
00:13:26,289 --> 00:13:30,159
search and seizure you know I was really

292
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:32,259
disappointed in Governor Kitzhaber when

293
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:35,740
I voted for him I thought he was a

294
00:13:32,259 --> 00:13:37,569
progressive Democrat would you know had

295
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:40,870
good ideas about what to do with this

296
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:42,820
state and it was my impression that he

297
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:44,769
had decided to veto this bill because

298
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:47,260
the state couldn't afford it if it can't

299
00:13:44,769 --> 00:13:50,500
afford to keep the libraries in Portland

300
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:51,938
open it can't afford to employ the

301
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:54,009
amount of teachers it takes to

302
00:13:51,938 --> 00:13:56,348
teach our children it can't afford to

303
00:13:54,009 --> 00:13:58,629
create more shelters for domestic

304
00:13:56,349 --> 00:14:01,889
violence victims I mean I thought that

305
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:04,178
the state could not afford to

306
00:14:01,889 --> 00:14:05,798
incarcerate a bunch of pot smokers and I

307
00:14:04,178 --> 00:14:07,058
thought the governor thought that do you

308
00:14:05,798 --> 00:14:08,978
ever talk to him

309
00:14:07,058 --> 00:14:11,318
I ran into the governor when I was down

310
00:14:08,979 --> 00:14:13,028
working in Salem and lobbying against

311
00:14:11,318 --> 00:14:15,308
this bill the governor told me

312
00:14:13,028 --> 00:14:18,009
personally when I ran into him at a

313
00:14:15,308 --> 00:14:20,318
coffee stand I was there to get a an

314
00:14:18,009 --> 00:14:21,938
expresso drink a drug at the drug stand

315
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:23,469
there you go it was an open-air drug

316
00:14:21,938 --> 00:14:25,778
market right in front of the State

317
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:29,678
Capitol they were selling caffeine

318
00:14:25,778 --> 00:14:32,619
beverages and these caffeine ones

319
00:14:29,678 --> 00:14:34,958
sometimes I bet you get whatever strings

320
00:14:32,619 --> 00:14:37,209
you want you know you want double dose

321
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:38,948
triple dose they'll they'll sell them to

322
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:42,158
you at these open-air caffeine markets

323
00:14:38,948 --> 00:14:44,588
and the governor was there in line

324
00:14:42,158 --> 00:14:46,269
waiting for his caffeine laced ring as I

325
00:14:44,589 --> 00:14:49,389
was going up to get my caffeine lace

326
00:14:46,269 --> 00:14:53,438
drink my coffee express it Moke actually

327
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:56,499
I don't drink coffee I drink and there

328
00:14:53,438 --> 00:14:59,288
he was and I couldn't resist half this

329
00:14:56,499 --> 00:15:01,239
rare once-in-a-lifetime opportunity okay

330
00:14:59,288 --> 00:15:02,798
exists pause I was I was supposed you

331
00:15:01,239 --> 00:15:06,009
know I've been trying to stop this

332
00:15:02,798 --> 00:15:07,749
recrimination bill and I thought I will

333
00:15:06,009 --> 00:15:09,009
never get to see the governor they

334
00:15:07,749 --> 00:15:11,558
wouldn't let me see him

335
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:15,249
I run into him at the coffee stand I say

336
00:15:11,558 --> 00:15:17,649
governor Kitzhaber this was early April

337
00:15:15,249 --> 00:15:20,019
I said governor Kitzhaber I'd like to

338
00:15:17,649 --> 00:15:23,349
take this opportunity to urge you to

339
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:24,729
veto House bill 36:43 well it hadn't

340
00:15:23,349 --> 00:15:26,679
been passed by either house of the

341
00:15:24,729 --> 00:15:28,449
legislature at that point but it looked

342
00:15:26,678 --> 00:15:30,428
pretty certain to pass there were a lot

343
00:15:28,448 --> 00:15:32,469
of different interests that were backing

344
00:15:30,428 --> 00:15:34,348
it everyone in the Republican Party and

345
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:36,548
they held control of both houses

346
00:15:34,349 --> 00:15:39,939
unanimously supported it well one

347
00:15:36,548 --> 00:15:42,639
senator limb out in Gresham opposed it

348
00:15:39,938 --> 00:15:44,738
one Republican but anyway the governor

349
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:47,470
turned I said and he goes well okay I

350
00:15:44,739 --> 00:15:50,798
said governor I want to urge you to veto

351
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:53,709
House bill 36:43 the governor said well

352
00:15:50,798 --> 00:15:55,869
which one is that I said that's the one

353
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:58,808
that would wreak reminisce possession of

354
00:15:55,869 --> 00:16:00,309
marijuana the governor got his drink

355
00:15:58,808 --> 00:16:02,048
from the man he turned around he looked

356
00:16:00,308 --> 00:16:03,969
at me says you know we really don't have

357
00:16:02,048 --> 00:16:05,129
the money for that and I'm going to be

358
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:06,480
to it that

359
00:16:05,129 --> 00:16:08,100
what he said he says we really don't

360
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,050
have the money for that and I'm going to

361
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:13,170
veto it well I couldn't agree more

362
00:16:10,049 --> 00:16:15,149
I was happy that's right in the end the

363
00:16:13,169 --> 00:16:18,899
governor claimed that he reluctantly

364
00:16:15,149 --> 00:16:22,649
signed it and he said it wasn't because

365
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:24,569
of possession of marijuana but that in

366
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:26,309
fact it was to expand the police powers

367
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:27,690
of search and seizure well we need to

368
00:16:26,309 --> 00:16:29,699
send a message to the governor and the

369
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:32,460
legislature and you can do that by

370
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:35,220
getting our petitions get the referendum

371
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:38,639
petition give us a call at two three

372
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:42,450
five four six zero six that's two three

373
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:44,939
five four six zero six we'll get you to

374
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:46,590
the referendum we've got to get 50,000

375
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:50,250
good registered Oregon voter signatures

376
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:54,629
by July no I bother

377
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:56,279
October 3rd of this year 1997 that's not

378
00:16:54,629 --> 00:16:58,169
if we do it'll stop it from going to

379
00:16:56,279 --> 00:17:00,149
effect it's not much time at all you

380
00:16:58,169 --> 00:17:02,639
might be seeing this show in in

381
00:17:00,149 --> 00:17:04,889
September I'm not sure maybe even

382
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:06,240
afterwards but if we don't get enough

383
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:08,579
signatures by then we're still

384
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,230
circulating the Oregon cannabis Tax Act

385
00:17:08,578 --> 00:17:12,180
which would legalize the sale of

386
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:14,068
marijuana to adults over 21

387
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:16,170
it would allow doctors to prescribe

388
00:17:14,068 --> 00:17:18,809
marijuana to patients through pharmacies

389
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:20,910
at cost it would tax the recreational

390
00:17:18,809 --> 00:17:26,568
marijuana that sold in liquor stores and

391
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:29,640
bars and coffee shops and it would also

392
00:17:26,568 --> 00:17:31,680
legalize industrial hemp so that farmers

393
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:33,240
can grow industrial hemp for production

394
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:36,350
of thousands of different products

395
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:38,759
everything from paper and fabric and

396
00:17:36,349 --> 00:17:41,789
building materials from the stems of the

397
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:44,759
marijuana plant to oil for food and

398
00:17:41,789 --> 00:17:47,399
energy and protein from the hemp seed

399
00:17:44,759 --> 00:17:50,430
you know actually hemp produces more

400
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:53,160
fiber protein and oil that any other

401
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:55,529
plant on our planet they've taken this

402
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:57,930
plant it grows more in the temperate and

403
00:17:55,529 --> 00:18:00,329
cooler climates than any other plant on

404
00:17:57,930 --> 00:18:05,009
the entire planet and they've prohibited

405
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:08,009
this plant and to me I believe that that

406
00:18:05,009 --> 00:18:10,829
is truly evil to take a plant that

407
00:18:08,009 --> 00:18:12,990
produces more fiber protein and oil and

408
00:18:10,829 --> 00:18:15,809
say oh you can't grow that one folks

409
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:17,880
because we want to say you petroleum we

410
00:18:15,809 --> 00:18:18,960
want to sell you pesticide lace cotton

411
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:21,090
whatever you want to cut

412
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:23,788
on all the forests and there that's what

413
00:18:21,089 --> 00:18:25,668
really bothers me is to think that

414
00:18:23,788 --> 00:18:27,690
they're not only cutting down trees for

415
00:18:25,669 --> 00:18:29,250
timber and things like that I can

416
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:33,210
understand that but they're cutting down

417
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:36,089
trees to make paper write paper from

418
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:38,429
Hampton you can from wood anyway yeah

419
00:18:36,089 --> 00:18:42,148
paper was that's a renewable resource

420
00:18:38,429 --> 00:18:44,009
it's an annual it grows every year you

421
00:18:42,148 --> 00:18:46,199
don't have to like grow a crop for like

422
00:18:44,009 --> 00:18:48,390
sixty years and have lunch dreams

423
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,830
running through it and animals living in

424
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:53,220
the trees and all that and then cut them

425
00:18:49,829 --> 00:18:55,710
down you can grow it like wheat and it

426
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:58,589
rejuvenates the soil really actually him

427
00:18:55,710 --> 00:19:00,690
has a very long tap root and it draws up

428
00:18:58,589 --> 00:19:03,418
subsoil nutrients and when the Leafs

429
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:05,480
fall off and go back into the soil it

430
00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:08,429
brings those nutrients up from the

431
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:11,759
minerals below and puts them into the

432
00:19:08,429 --> 00:19:16,470
the soil for other plants to use so it's

433
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:20,278
a very good plant for breaking soil and

434
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:22,710
for revitalizing soil in a crop harvest

435
00:19:20,278 --> 00:19:27,450
and it'll grow anywhere I've seen him

436
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:31,019
growing in a swamp condition in China in

437
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:34,830
China in fact they invented paper 2,000

438
00:19:31,019 --> 00:19:36,528
years ago from him and the first cloth

439
00:19:34,829 --> 00:19:39,509
and textiles were made from him all

440
00:19:36,528 --> 00:19:41,640
archaeologists agree that hemp was one

441
00:19:39,509 --> 00:19:42,269
of the first plants purposely cultivated

442
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,309
by man

443
00:19:42,269 --> 00:19:45,929
there are three other plants that they

444
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:48,269
can't distinguish which one was the very

445
00:19:45,929 --> 00:19:50,880
first one but all archaeologists agree

446
00:19:48,269 --> 00:19:53,190
that hemp was definitely among the first

447
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:56,510
plants so you're talking about the plant

448
00:19:53,190 --> 00:20:01,798
that perhaps agriculture was invented to

449
00:19:56,509 --> 00:20:05,879
to service bins need for him for both

450
00:20:01,798 --> 00:20:07,798
medicine protein fiber and oil and the

451
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:09,990
plant that produces more of this protein

452
00:20:07,798 --> 00:20:12,089
fiber and oil to me that's just a

453
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:15,120
travesty we've got to change that a

454
00:20:12,089 --> 00:20:19,769
plant that's as useful as him I wonder

455
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:20,879
why they would make it illegal I mean it

456
00:20:19,769 --> 00:20:22,740
baffles me

457
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:25,020
you know the American Medical

458
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:28,980
Association actually went into Congress

459
00:20:25,019 --> 00:20:32,400
in 1937 a dr. Woodard and testified that

460
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:35,069
they should not criminalize hemp the

461
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:37,920
Annabeth's had many medicine properties

462
00:20:35,069 --> 00:20:40,679
and that what they were saying

463
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:42,840
marijuana caused at the time they said

464
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:44,490
smoking any marijuana would cause you to

465
00:20:42,839 --> 00:20:48,119
go crazy and kill your family and

466
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:50,609
friends they actually laid out documents

467
00:20:48,119 --> 00:20:53,609
that and the doctor the lobbyist for the

468
00:20:50,609 --> 00:20:55,859
American Medical Association told the

469
00:20:53,609 --> 00:20:58,169
congressional committee that that's not

470
00:20:55,859 --> 00:21:01,189
true that those things aren't so and he

471
00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:04,140
opposed it and several legislators

472
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:08,789
harassed this doctor and told him he

473
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:11,460
shouldn't be trying to stop lawmakers at

474
00:21:08,789 --> 00:21:14,849
work and then when it came to a full

475
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:16,650
vote in the House of Representatives one

476
00:21:14,849 --> 00:21:18,859
senator from that committee stood up and

477
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:21,390
lied and said that that doctor had

478
00:21:18,859 --> 00:21:23,909
supported the bill when in fact he had

479
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:26,280
opposed it that's um so it passed

480
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:29,009
without debate sounds a lot like I've

481
00:21:26,279 --> 00:21:30,869
made my mind is made up don't bother

482
00:21:29,009 --> 00:21:34,829
true though that it happened actually

483
00:21:30,869 --> 00:21:38,279
was August 2nd 1937 so here it is just

484
00:21:34,829 --> 00:21:40,769
over living in infamy so here we are a

485
00:21:38,279 --> 00:21:45,539
little bit more than 60 years later and

486
00:21:40,769 --> 00:21:47,190
we're facing a drug war who's the winner

487
00:21:45,539 --> 00:21:48,960
in the drug war I don't think there are

488
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:51,539
any winners is there any sign that

489
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:54,420
there's going to be a victory yet after

490
00:21:51,539 --> 00:21:56,759
60 years I don't think so instead you

491
00:21:54,420 --> 00:22:00,600
see the patients in the alternative

492
00:21:56,759 --> 00:22:03,059
health center they're facing the rest

493
00:22:00,599 --> 00:22:06,269
they're in danger of going to jail and I

494
00:22:03,059 --> 00:22:08,399
mean these people are sick what's it

495
00:22:06,269 --> 00:22:12,930
what kind of care is there going to be

496
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:14,340
for them in jail I don't believe that

497
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:16,170
they're going to be able to and how much

498
00:22:14,339 --> 00:22:18,289
is it going to cost to care for these

499
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:20,850
people in jail I mean how many

500
00:22:18,289 --> 00:22:23,369
wheelchairs do they keep in jails I

501
00:22:20,849 --> 00:22:24,599
don't know but they want to take them in

502
00:22:23,369 --> 00:22:28,349
there and book them and possibly

503
00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:30,359
sentence them to up to 30 days if they

504
00:22:28,349 --> 00:22:33,569
have an ounce or less now if the patient

505
00:22:30,359 --> 00:22:35,549
can't afford to go and buy marijuana in

506
00:22:33,569 --> 00:22:39,000
the black market and they happen to be

507
00:22:35,549 --> 00:22:41,339
growing one or two plants well it's

508
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,500
escalated folks that's those are that's

509
00:22:41,339 --> 00:22:46,289
a Class A felony it's the same as murder

510
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:47,880
rate it's worse than man's

511
00:22:46,289 --> 00:22:50,460
slaughtered rape actually it's the

512
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:52,110
equivalent of murder and those people

513
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:54,450
have their homes taken away have their

514
00:22:52,109 --> 00:22:56,879
property seized they're convicted felons

515
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:59,309
they have to go through drug treatment

516
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,590
and diversion it's really a very

517
00:22:59,309 --> 00:23:03,779
horrible system folks and we need to

518
00:23:01,589 --> 00:23:06,119
send the message to politicians and you

519
00:23:03,779 --> 00:23:09,329
can do that by calling us and getting

520
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:13,279
the referendum to stop the recrimination

521
00:23:09,329 --> 00:23:16,710
of marijuana to referendum on House bill

522

00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:03,930
course that was before the

541
00:24:02,029 --> 00:24:06,539
regionalization happen so we weren't

542
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:09,539
carrying it then but the recrimination

543
00:24:06,539 --> 00:24:12,569
petition as we're going to tape here in

544
00:24:09,539 --> 00:24:15,000

and get our petitions because the only

548
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:26,880
way we're going to make a difference is

549
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:29,009
if we get out and show the support by

550
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,150

551
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:33,509

552
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:38,310
so I urge you to call us today don't

553
00:24:33,509 --> 00:24:41,099
delay because the next door to be kicked

554
00:24:38,309 --> 00:24:43,049
in may be your own that's the truth it

555
00:24:41,099 --> 00:24:45,419
always amazes me the things they say

556
00:24:43,049 --> 00:24:47,460
about what like you're saying that

557
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:50,160
burned that smoking marijuana makes

558
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:51,420
people crazy and they were going to kill

559
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:54,450
their friends and that's the kind of

560
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:57,210
thing they call that reefer blast how

561
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:59,039
many people in this country have smoked

562
00:24:57,210 --> 00:24:59,769
marijuana at some time is it twenty

563
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:02,129
million is it

564
00:24:59,769 --> 00:25:06,940
well no 20 million they estimate our

565
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:08,560
regular monthly users narrator but the

566
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:11,080
total number I think of people who'll

567
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:13,809
admit to it is about 80 million are

568
00:25:11,079 --> 00:25:16,779
almost half the population immense that

569
00:25:13,809 --> 00:25:19,899
even Bill Clinton said he huffed but

570
00:25:16,779 --> 00:25:22,299
didn't inhale and Newt Gingrich says he

571
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:24,310
he smoked marijuana for some period of

572
00:25:22,299 --> 00:25:27,639
time I believe Al Gore Al and Tipper

573
00:25:24,309 --> 00:25:30,639
Gore inhaled as well yeah these people

574
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:33,340
didn't ruin their lives they didn't

575
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:35,680
start killing their families I mean you

576
00:25:33,339 --> 00:25:36,819
know that that's a lie I mean even those

577
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:38,940
of you who don't smoke marijuana

578
00:25:36,819 --> 00:25:42,159
yourself so you know somebody that does

579
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:43,930
and they're just people like anybody

580
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:46,630
else they have jobs they have children

581
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:49,630
they have homes actually some studies

582
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:55,870
show that marijuana smokers have a

583
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:58,840
higher instance of on time job

584
00:25:55,869 --> 00:26:01,149
performance being at work on most days

585
00:25:58,839 --> 00:26:05,919
non marijuana smokers actually have a

586
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:07,480
higher rate of absenteeism and I think

587
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:09,640
that's indicative of some of the

588
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:10,029
propaganda most people find that hard to

589
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,860
believe

590
00:26:10,029 --> 00:26:15,039
well that's why they don't record it

591
00:26:11,859 --> 00:26:19,589
very much driving stream media but the

592
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:22,329
fact of the matter is that the media

593
00:26:19,589 --> 00:26:24,579
manipulates certain groups manipulate

594
00:26:22,329 --> 00:26:28,379
the media particularly the law

595
00:26:24,579 --> 00:26:33,189
enforcement people and the folks in the

596
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:34,960
drug treatment industry that oh that

597
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:37,269
makes me think you know with the

598
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:40,180
referendum I believe that one of the

599
00:26:37,269 --> 00:26:42,730
things is mandatory drug treatment the

600
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:46,210
drug treatment industry is going to make

601
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:49,000
a lot of money from this they've got to

602
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:52,480
be the behind supporting this yeah and

603
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:56,740
it requires the a mandatory diversion

604
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:58,839
project for anyone who's convicted and

605
00:26:56,740 --> 00:27:01,660
you have your license suspended for six

606
00:26:58,839 --> 00:27:04,599
months and if you're under 18 you don't

607
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:06,759
get your driver's license until you've

608
00:27:04,599 --> 00:27:08,289
turned 18 and that doesn't it doesn't

609
00:27:06,759 --> 00:27:10,180
matter where you've been arrested with

610
00:27:08,289 --> 00:27:11,869
marijuana to have this happen you could

611
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:14,950
be in your bedroom you could

612
00:27:11,869 --> 00:27:18,829
be out in the woods you could be

613
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:21,230
anywhere and those laws are in effect

614
00:27:18,829 --> 00:27:24,859
they'll take away your driver's license

615
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:27,019
and make you go into diversion you have

616
00:27:24,859 --> 00:27:29,509
up to 30 days in jail they'll seize your

617
00:27:27,019 --> 00:27:31,339
property it's really a terrible system

618
00:27:29,509 --> 00:27:33,079
and we're trying to change that by

619
00:27:31,339 --> 00:27:36,679
circulating the referendum and the

620
00:27:33,079 --> 00:27:38,839
Oregon cannabis Tax Act so once again I

621
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:41,000
want to urge you to give us a call get

622
00:27:38,839 --> 00:27:43,939
help us put the Oregon cannabis Tax Act

623
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:46,250
on the ballot help us stop the black

624
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:47,779
market you know right now the main

625
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:49,609
people who are controlling the black

626
00:27:47,779 --> 00:27:52,910
market are kids

627
00:27:49,609 --> 00:27:54,829
and users substance abusers by night and

628
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:56,808
people who have used other substances

629
00:27:54,829 --> 00:27:59,319
besides just marijuana I'm sure and

630
00:27:56,808 --> 00:28:02,058
that's the reason that marijuana is

631
00:27:59,319 --> 00:28:03,980
labeled by some as a gateway drug you

632
00:28:02,058 --> 00:28:06,529
know it's a gateway but it's a gateway

633
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:08,329
to the black market if we take marijuana

634
00:28:06,529 --> 00:28:10,220
out of the black market like they have

635
00:28:08,329 --> 00:28:11,839
in the Netherlands then the rate of use

636
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:14,630
of all drugs is going to decline

637
00:28:11,839 --> 00:28:17,928
according to a survey that was quoted in

638
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:21,260
the British Medical Journal back in

639
00:28:17,929 --> 00:28:24,620
December of 1995 it's called D

640
00:28:21,259 --> 00:28:26,420
glamorizing cannabis and that article

641
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:29,178
said that the rate of use of marijuana

642
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:31,700
in the Netherlands by people who are 16

643
00:28:29,179 --> 00:28:33,320
and 17 years old people who have legal

644
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:35,600
access because in the Netherlands you

645
00:28:33,319 --> 00:28:38,029
can buy marijuana when you're 16 years

646
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:39,709
old that the rate of use is less than

647
00:28:38,029 --> 00:28:44,660
one-fifth what it is here in the United

648
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:46,970
States that's obviously indicative of

649
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:49,250
the fact that prohibition isn't working

650
00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:51,558
so we want you to get our petitions want

651
