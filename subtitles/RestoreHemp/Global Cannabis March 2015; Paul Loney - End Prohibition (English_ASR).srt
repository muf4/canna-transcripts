00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:26,939
we passed measure 91 but the rest of it

9
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:29,039

00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,480
see a doctor you know you have to say

13
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,399
stop the discrimination against cannabis

14
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:40,558
right

15
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,239

16
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:44,820

that's the only way we're going to do it

21
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:58,558
because right now you know your landlord

22
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:00,480
can tell you no if you're living

23

and then they're then they're trying to

27
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:13,260
pass bills they want to pass bills that

28
00:01:10,978 --> 00:01:16,500
say you can't even have a cannabis club

29
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:19,260
right check out my shirt right

30
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:21,420

40
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:43,379
don't want us to smoke anywhere that's

41
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,359
what it sounds like they're saying hey

42
00:01:43,379 --> 00:01:47,640
you know if you live in certain housing

43
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:49,978

44
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,840
tells you you can't smoke you can't

45
00:01:49,978 --> 00:01:53,340
smoke because you're fortified you know

46
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,680
I said oh I'm not gonna treat you for X

47
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:59,399
Y and Z if you're a marijuana consumer

freedom

50
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:05,579
we have to keep working freedom and I'll

51
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:07,979
call the folks and Salem and say this is

52
00:02:05,578 --> 00:02:09,659
not enough why they're busy down there

53
00:02:07,978 --> 00:02:12,360
attacking the Oregon medical marijuana

54
00:02:09,659 --> 00:02:15,060
program we've got to remind them we got

55
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:18,000

69
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,900
and we didn't allow we know it's not

70
00:02:50,098 --> 00:02:54,119
just to end public prohibition we need

71
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:56,599
to end private prohibition that's what

72
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,739
we're facing you know people are being

73
00:02:56,598 --> 00:03:02,159
discriminated against because there are

74
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:04,080

86
00:03:25,979 --> 00:03:29,219
beginning

87
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,620
just the beginning right now we really

88
00:03:29,219 --> 00:03:33,598
have to push for our freedoms because

89
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:36,120
they want to push back we're seeing

90
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:38,339
already down in Salem when you know when

91
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:40,439
the Oregon League of cities and the

92
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:42,479
counties are trying to say no you can't

93
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:44,639
you can't have a dispensary there you

94
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:47,219
can't have a grow there I mean they're

95
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:49,378
trying to say that if you're grow if one

96
00:03:47,219 --> 00:03:51,719
little piece of Aroma escapes your

97
00:03:49,378 --> 00:03:55,679
property you can't grow

98
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:57,719
yes you know you know we they don't say

99
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,459
that about chicken farms my next door

100
00:03:57,719 --> 00:04:02,400
neighbor has chickens I can smell the

101
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:05,280
chickens that's okay

102
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:08,158
yeah why why is it marijuana smell okay

103
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,680
I mean come on this isn't you know this

104
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:12,120
is not what we're about here in America

105
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,400
right as long as we don't hurt somebody

106
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:16,319
else it should be okay that's what we're

107
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,939
a country was founded on

108
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:19,918
so we need to believe that folks and

109
00:04:17,939 --> 00:04:22,740
keep pushing keep pushing for your

110
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:25,019
freedoms you know we can't rest now we

111
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:26,879
can't stop we still have to prove

112
00:04:25,019 --> 00:04:29,039
ourselves it's what I tell say folks

113
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:30,478
every day come to my office you know

114
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,939
yeah it's hard right now because we have

115
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:35,159
to prove that our industry is a good

116
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:36,660
industry we're not going to harm others

117
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:39,300
and we're especially not going to harm

118
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:41,759
children we are a very good industry

119
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:43,918
we're very proper and we're you know we

120
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:46,879
have to go above and beyond say the

121
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:50,219
alcohol industry the tobacco industry

122
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:52,379
yes I mean why is why can our college

123
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:55,020
football teams here in the state Oregon

124
00:04:52,379 --> 00:04:57,839
State and Oregon have official beer

125
00:04:55,019 --> 00:05:00,180
right why you know that doesn't make any

126
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:01,619
sense at all folks that's that's what

127
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:04,379
that's kind of the hurdles that we're

128
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:06,660
facing right now we have

129
00:05:04,379 --> 00:05:10,259
exactly they're not 21. so we have to

130
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:12,900
keep keep that out there all right so

131
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:15,600
I see Scott give me the nod so I'm going

132
00:05:12,899 --> 00:05:17,758
to end up as Nikki knows and Laurie

133
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:21,360
knows with my famous little things I

134
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:23,038
want folks to repeat after me

135
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,500
this is what you have to say when an

136
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:29,418
officer comes to you

137
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:29,418
am I free to go officer

138
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:39,139
a little bit louder am I free to

139
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:39,139
I do not consent to any searches

140
00:05:40,918 --> 00:05:44,599
I wish to speak to my attorney

141
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,900
and I wish to remain silent

142
00:05:51,538 --> 00:05:54,560
thank you folks
