00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:06,419

2

parula Gardner I am a patient a farmer

5
00:00:14,029 --> 00:00:19,198
and a representative of the organic

6
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:22,500
farmers of Southern Oregon who could not

7
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:25,320
be here today I say to the Oregon Health

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:28,198
Authority and the measure 91 committee

9
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:30,570
you have overstepped your legal and

10
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:34,109
moral authority you do not have the

11
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:37,350
right to overturn the will of 850,000

12
00:00:34,109 --> 00:00:41,329
Oregon voters who directed the olcc rec

13
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:44,460
process to make no amendment to the OMP

14
00:00:41,329 --> 00:00:47,128
our medical marijuana program has been

15
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:49,920
described in places like Israel Poland

16
00:00:47,128 --> 00:00:52,769
Czech Republic Spain and elsewhere as

17
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,170
the finest medical cannabis system in

18
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:58,350
the world the state of Oregon has

19
00:00:55,170 --> 00:01:00,780
blatantly openly attempted to dismantle

20
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:04,109
our program at breakneck speed with no

21
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:05,700
patient consultation the farmers of

22
00:01:04,109 --> 00:01:07,859
Southern Oregon and the people of Oregon

23
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:10,500
will not allow the state to eliminate

24
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:13,228
Oregon's world leadership in protecting

25
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:16,530
patient access to affordable organic

26
00:01:13,228 --> 00:01:21,450
plant medicine the research on tobacco

27
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:24,060
is in conclusively tobacco impairs IQ

28
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:27,570
and cognitive development one person

29
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:31,618
dies from tobacco in the world on

30
00:01:27,569 --> 00:01:33,868
average every six seconds why is tobacco

31
00:01:31,618 --> 00:01:35,340
seed not regulate it as tightly as you

32
00:01:33,868 --> 00:01:38,459
have proposed that Oregon should

33
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:41,009
regulate cannabis seed cannabis

34
00:01:38,459 --> 00:01:43,828
regulation must be no more punitive than

35
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:46,049
tobacco regulation since tobacco is far

36
00:01:43,828 --> 00:01:49,769
more addictive more toxic and kills

37
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:53,220
Americans every day no one has yet died

38
00:01:49,769 --> 00:01:55,140
of cannabis intoxication excessive

39
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:57,599
license fees harmed the regulatory

40
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:59,939
system by discrediting the authority of

41
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:02,399
the state to regulate how much her

42
00:01:59,938 --> 00:02:05,229
tobacco farmers charged for drop drying

43
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:07,930
and rolling their crop

44
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:10,689
OHA the state of Oregon may not impose

45
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:13,330
any fee increases until small producers

46
00:02:10,689 --> 00:02:16,539
can see clearly how these funds will be

47
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:18,070
used to help small producers the state

48
00:02:16,539 --> 00:02:20,500
of Oregon has forgotten that most

49
00:02:18,069 --> 00:02:23,409
farmers in Oregon are not rich we are

50
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:25,750
struggling financially the draconian

51
00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:28,659
proposed regulatory system seems

52
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:31,000
unlikely to benefit the people actually

53
00:02:28,659 --> 00:02:33,430
paying these licenses fees and taxes

54
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,120
this looks like taxation without

55
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:39,610
representation proposing unenforceable

56
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,159
regulations which unleash the terror of

57
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:44,440
police search without a warrant could be

58
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:47,590
just the tipping point to ignite

59
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:48,759
Oregon's first civil war in defense of

60
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:53,020
the Fourth Amendment to the US

61
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:55,479
Constitution does our legislature want

62
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:59,500
to take responsibility for criminalizing

63
00:02:55,479 --> 00:03:04,870
law-abiding Oregon citizens we will not

64
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:06,430
comply with unjust laws and rules the

65
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:09,069
world is watching decisions made here

66
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:11,260
with great interest do the people of

67
00:03:09,069 --> 00:03:13,120
Oregon need to sue the state to remind

68
00:03:11,259 --> 00:03:17,069
you that the sovereign right of the

69
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:21,459
people of Oregon does govern our state

70
00:03:17,069 --> 00:03:24,099
my directive to OHA is to maintain ommp

71
00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:27,370
medical cannabis as it stands in January

72
00:03:24,099 --> 00:03:29,530
2015 to protect patients and the quality

73
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:34,420
of medical cannabis produced in Oregon

74
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:37,449
make no change 20 MNT in 2016 no

75
00:03:34,419 --> 00:03:39,569
compromise no amendment 20 mm p thank

76
00:03:37,449 --> 00:03:39,569
you
