1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,690
main thing you take anything away from

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:09,690
my talk it's that marijuana him is the

3
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:13,320
oldest crop purposely grown by people

4
00:00:09,689 --> 00:00:16,320
over 12,000 years ago the first

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:18,528
agricultural settlements in Mesopotamia

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:22,140
along the Tigris and Euphrates River

7
00:00:18,528 --> 00:00:26,518
present-day Iraq and on the opposite

8
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:28,469
flank of the Himalayas in a china long

9
00:00:26,518 --> 00:00:31,348
the Wang Han River in the Yellow River

10
00:00:28,469 --> 00:00:35,308
both of those civilizations started

11
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:36,780
growing marijuana you know him they grew

12
00:00:35,308 --> 00:00:40,558
it because it's the plant that produces

13
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:43,920
the most fuel the most food the most

14
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:47,280
fiber and the most medicine than any

15
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:50,189
other plant on this planet so obviously

16
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:54,149
to prohibit the plant that makes the

17
00:00:50,189 --> 00:00:57,058
most fuel the most food most fiber the

18
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:59,730
most medicine than any other plant is

19
00:00:57,058 --> 00:01:02,159
wrong so we're working hard to try to

20
00:00:59,729 --> 00:01:06,500
change that you know there are a number

21
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:08,908
about initiatives out there this year I

22
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:11,400
particularly have been working in Oregon

23
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:12,930
because that's where I live and we put a

24
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,689
measure on the ballot there we call

25
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:18,299
measure 80 it would legalize any

26
00:01:15,688 --> 00:01:20,368
individual to grow their own without any

27
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:22,830
artificial limits on the amount that

28
00:01:20,368 --> 00:01:25,409
they can grow it also doesn't have any

29
00:01:22,829 --> 00:01:27,868
limits on the amount that you can

30
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:31,979
possess vlogs it's for non-commercial

31
00:01:27,868 --> 00:01:34,950
use it frees horticultural him sow the

32
00:01:31,978 --> 00:01:38,489
seeds and starts of all varieties of

33
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:41,810
cannabis will be legal and it legalized

34
00:01:38,489 --> 00:01:44,640
sniff for fuel fiber and food without

35
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:46,950
regulation the only regulation is that

36
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:50,368
the strains that grow the best quality

37
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:54,840
and the best quantity of fiber will be

38
00:01:50,368 --> 00:01:56,700
the ones that Oregon farmers can use you

39
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:02,070
know there's also an initiative on the

40
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:06,270
bound here I 502 and one in Washington

41
00:02:02,069 --> 00:02:09,478
Colorado amendment 64 three-stage will

42
00:02:06,269 --> 00:02:10,460
vote on various proposals to legalize

43
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:15,560
marijuana

44
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:18,439
this year if any of those paths will

45
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:21,740
change the whole dynamic it is if all

46
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:25,009
three of those initiatives pass that

47
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:26,930
would be like the the end of the Cold

48
00:02:25,009 --> 00:02:30,109
War and the following of the Berlin Wall

49
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:32,300
it'll be like the toppling of statue of

50
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:34,730
linen in Red Square back in nineteen

51
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:37,520
ninety if all three of these initiatives

52
00:02:34,729 --> 00:02:39,069
passed it will send a message that the

53
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:42,200
people aren't going to put up with

54
00:02:39,069 --> 00:02:43,939
marijuana prohibition any longer and you

55
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:47,359
know there was a good breakthrough just

56
00:02:43,939 --> 00:02:51,710
this past week in Kansas City Missouri a

57
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:54,380
jury was impaneled to prosecute some guy

58
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:56,540
for possession of marijuana and he had

59
00:02:54,379 --> 00:03:00,289
bought some tax stamp they needed there

60
00:02:56,539 --> 00:03:03,169
in Missouri the jury revolted they got

61
00:03:00,289 --> 00:03:05,449
angry at the prosecutor they told them

62
00:03:03,169 --> 00:03:08,809
they aren't going to prosecute this guy

63
00:03:05,449 --> 00:03:12,319
so the judge threw the charges out made

64
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:15,009
it where he can't be tried again if you

65
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:18,319
get an opportunity to serve on jury duty

66
00:03:15,009 --> 00:03:21,229
go there and just say no to marijuana

67
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:24,289
laws tell em you're not gonna Brock

68
00:03:21,229 --> 00:03:26,569
you're not going to convict anyone for a

69
00:03:24,289 --> 00:03:33,590
marijuana crime because marijuana isn't

70
00:03:26,569 --> 00:03:35,900
a crime marijuana is a blessing so you

71
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:39,580
