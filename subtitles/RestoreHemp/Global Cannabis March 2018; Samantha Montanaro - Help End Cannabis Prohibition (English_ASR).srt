1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:08,309
hello everybody how you doing today I am

2
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:10,289
so so grateful to be here today with you

3
00:00:08,308 --> 00:00:13,500
this be absolutely beautiful day in

4
00:00:10,289 --> 00:00:17,339
downtown Portland um to free the plant

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:21,868
we have a lot of work to do um our earth

6
00:00:17,339 --> 00:00:24,390
is hurting our people are hurting this

7
00:00:21,868 --> 00:00:28,500
sacred balance of the feminine and

8
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:30,510
masculine is off it's really off and I

9
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:33,539
don't know about you but I believe that

10
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:37,200
cannabis is the key to restoring balance

11
00:00:33,539 --> 00:00:41,939
to restoring equity and to restoring our

12
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:43,320
health with cannabis legalization we

13
00:00:41,939 --> 00:00:46,468
have an opportunity to do things

14
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:48,359
differently I see this as an opportunity

15
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:50,489
for us to free our people who are

16
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:53,878
sitting in jail still right now as other

17
00:00:50,488 --> 00:00:56,038
people profit off of this plant we have

18
00:00:53,878 --> 00:00:59,280
an opportunity to create a solution to

19
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:02,219
our dependency on plastics on toxic

20
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,019
chemicals and on all sorts of things

21
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:04,739
that don't seem to make sense for us

22
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:07,770
anymore

23
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:11,130
hemp is a solution to many many many

24
00:01:07,769 --> 00:01:14,219
things we have a chance to restore

25
00:01:11,129 --> 00:01:17,359
equity for men and women for people of

26
00:01:14,219 --> 00:01:19,769
all skin colors from all over the world

27
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:22,109
we have an opportunity to actually

28
00:01:19,769 --> 00:01:24,090
create programs with equity built into

29
00:01:22,109 --> 00:01:26,129
them I am envious of the other places

30
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:28,650
that are putting those policies into

31
00:01:26,129 --> 00:01:30,810
place right now and I want Portland to

32
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:34,829
do the same and Oregon to do the same

33
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:36,450
for us to get you know give assistance

34
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:37,978
to the people that were in jail and

35
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:40,680
whatever else give them an opportunity

36
00:01:37,978 --> 00:01:43,170
to be working in cannabis through

37
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:45,329
supportive programs grant programs and

38
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:50,700
just assistance I believe that this is

39
00:01:45,328 --> 00:01:52,618
our duty finally I think that cannabis

40
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:55,728
legalization is an opportunity for

41
00:01:52,618 --> 00:01:58,290
empowerment for women and men for us to

42
00:01:55,728 --> 00:02:01,519
step up and take charge of our own lives

43
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:04,829
and our own health and our own people

44
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:08,818
why do you love cannabis I know I love

45
00:02:04,828 --> 00:02:12,019
cannabis because it heals me for so many

46
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:13,469
different properties I have scoliosis

47
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:18,030
osteoarthritis

48
00:02:13,469 --> 00:02:22,169
I'm a mom I need cannabis for so many

49
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:23,669
reasons on a daily basis and I think one

50
00:02:22,169 --> 00:02:25,639
of my favorite things about cannabis is

51
00:02:23,669 --> 00:02:27,869
it helps me work through challenges

52
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:29,639
emotional challenges if I'm ready to

53
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:32,629
work out something it will bring it up

54
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:36,029
and it will help me work through it

55
00:02:32,629 --> 00:02:38,250
cannabis aids in our pain emotionally

56
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:41,780
and physically and until we realize this

57
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:44,990
I don't think the plant will be free

58
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:48,020
cannabis helps me see my truths and

59
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:51,600
cannabis helps me face my fears

60
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:53,909
we all deserve love happiness health

61
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:57,209
equal rights and access to clean

62
00:02:53,909 --> 00:02:59,849
medicine my son carmine is here today

63
00:02:57,209 --> 00:03:02,340
and I want him to live in a world where

64
00:02:59,849 --> 00:03:05,209
he's free from shame around using

65
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:05,209
cannabis as medicine
