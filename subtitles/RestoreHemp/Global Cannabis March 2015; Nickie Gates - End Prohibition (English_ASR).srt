1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:05,560
can I just say Portland is absolutely

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,560
beautiful

3
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:12,240
today hi I want to first I want to know

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,359
if anybody's asking the patients what

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,640
they

6
00:00:14,359 --> 00:00:20,559
want I don't think so cuz they can't be

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:23,039
cuz if anybody was the number of plants

8
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:25,679
would a grower can grow would not be

9
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,960
dropping in numbers or the amount of

10
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:30,599
patience a grower can grow

11
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,719
for

12
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:34,759
wouldn't be dropping in numbers there

13
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,960
are too many patients that depend and

14
00:00:34,759 --> 00:00:40,679
rely on topicals

15
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:43,640
Edibles inhalent FCO or

16
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:47,119
RSO it takes a lot of plants to be able

17
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:49,719
to provide it we all and we all know we

18
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:53,479
can't or shouldn't stop taking it or

19
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:55,920
what ails you can and will

20
00:00:53,479 --> 00:00:58,959
return there will definitely be a rise

21
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:01,239
in six patients I don't want to a I want

22
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:04,079
to know if any anybody still asking the

23
00:01:01,238 --> 00:01:08,679
patients what they

24
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:08,679

43
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:17,360

national that is just one of the things

52
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:44,039
that the other spot does pretty soon

53
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:48,238
there will be nowhere for anyone to

54
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:51,400
go and medicate and be social under one

55
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:56,480
common roof these places like the other

56
00:02:51,400 --> 00:03:00,080
spot don't exist then our sociability

57
00:02:56,479 --> 00:03:03,479
dies we and Me Myself Believe that there

58
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:07,080
needs to be 50 more of these

59
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:09,959
places to go and medicate and be

60
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:12,120
social there's certainly enough medical

61
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:15,439
dispensaries out

62
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:17,799
there but where the Clean Air Act comes

63
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:21,959
in there will be nowhere for us to go

64
00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:26,640
and medicate in out of public view so we

65
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:26,640
as patients will continue to break this

66
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:30,400
law so it is important for you to

67
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:33,878
