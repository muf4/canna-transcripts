30
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:43,319
Court where a state not activists not

31
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:45,718
patients not organizations but a state

32
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:50,519
will be in such conflict with federal

33
00:01:45,718 --> 00:01:53,078
law that the Supreme Court must rule on

34
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:57,319
whether or not a state can legalize

35
00:01:53,078 --> 00:02:00,038

will want marijuana legalized so this is

43
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:27,679

50
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,039
like California which is a nation unto

51
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,360
itself with one eight out of eight

52
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:57,598
Americans living there came within three

53
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,599
percentage points of legalizing
