1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,970
I'll start with where I represent

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:04,318
represent south jackson county

3
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:06,660
everything from the green springs to

4
00:00:04,318 --> 00:00:09,960
ashland talent phoenix into Jacksonville

5
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:12,089
into the Applegate Valley I'm the house

6
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,500
Democratic co-chair of the Ways and

7
00:00:12,089 --> 00:00:16,589
Means Committee which is the Budget

8
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:18,149
Committee in the state and I've always I

9
00:00:16,589 --> 00:00:20,519
have favored legalization for for many

10
00:00:18,149 --> 00:00:22,890
years I think prohibition does has not

11
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:25,559
worked we have decades of evidence that

12
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:28,980
says prohibition does not work and it's

13
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:31,320
counterproductive but what really spurs

14
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,910
me on now is having spent the last three

15
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,939
or four years on the Budget Committee

16
00:00:32,909 --> 00:00:38,488
signing my name's to budgets that cut

17
00:00:35,939 --> 00:00:40,530
education for our kids that cut health

18
00:00:38,488 --> 00:00:42,839
care for seniors that make our

19
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:45,239
communities less safe by cutting back

20
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:48,480
public safety programs I can't in good

21
00:00:45,238 --> 00:00:50,788
conscience continue to do that work of

22
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:53,669
trying to rebalance a state budget

23
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:56,460
through cuts when I know there is a

24
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:58,530
source of revenue that is reasonable

25
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:00,600
that is rational it's the right policy

26
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:02,129
choice and it's strike economic choice

27
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,198
for our state and that's the

28
00:01:02,128 --> 00:01:06,359
legalization of marijuana and a

29
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:07,709
legalization of industrial hemp and i'm

30
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:11,700
not sure if all of you understand your

31
00:01:07,709 --> 00:01:14,789
followed this but in 2009 the

32
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:17,879
legislature passed a bill confirming the

33
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:20,520
state of Oregon's policy is to have

34
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:22,829
legalized industrial hemp in our state

35
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:24,929
the federal government still says we

36
00:01:22,829 --> 00:01:27,359
cannot grow it but we've passed

37
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:29,159
legislation on industrial hemp that as

38
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:31,349
soon as the federal government comes to

39
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:33,030
a rational decision on that and allows

40
00:01:31,349 --> 00:01:34,500
the production of industrial hemp our

41
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:36,810
state will be ready to move into

42
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:38,728
production of industrial hemp and that

43
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:40,439
is it that that proposal just so you

44
00:01:38,728 --> 00:01:43,200
know passed almost unanimously

45
00:01:40,438 --> 00:01:45,148
Republican and Democratic urban and

46
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,250
rural in fact the representatives in the

47
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:50,519
senators from Eastern Oregon were some

48
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:52,769
of the most enthusiastic backers of

49
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:54,719
having industrial hemp as a crop for our

50
00:01:52,769 --> 00:01:56,548
state because it just makes sense makes

51
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:58,170
economic sense for jobs in their

52
00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:00,390
community it makes economic sense for

53
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:02,129
the state so we will get there on

54
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:05,280
industrial hemp and we are going to get

55
00:02:02,129 --> 00:02:07,289
there and legalization the I can liken

56
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,110
this to the effort through the

57
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:12,450
initiative system of when women got the

58
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:13,350
right to vote Oregon was the first state

59
00:02:12,449 --> 00:02:15,329
to put that on the

60
00:02:13,349 --> 00:02:17,430
out and have it passed by our people it

61
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:19,290
took three times to get on the bat three

62
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:20,760
times on the ballot to finally pass and

63
00:02:19,289 --> 00:02:23,039
begin the law of the state of Oregon

64
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:24,179
this effort has been building and we

65
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:26,009
have people here have worked on it for

66
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:28,590
many many years has been building for

67
00:02:26,009 --> 00:02:31,019
many years we're at a point now we're

68
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:32,430
making a major leap forward by having

69
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:35,939
this on the ballot for the voters of

70
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:37,830
Oregon to give their their view on they

71
00:02:35,939 --> 00:02:40,469
will render their verdict next Tuesday

72
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:42,450
will know what it is and if it passes

73
00:02:40,469 --> 00:02:43,949
where they sincerely hope it does we'll

74
00:02:42,449 --> 00:02:45,389
work with us to make it work and we'll

75
00:02:43,949 --> 00:02:47,579
keep putting pressure on the feds to

76
00:02:45,389 --> 00:02:48,959
make sure that becomes the law for the

77
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:50,670
state of Oregon and hopefully influence

78
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,560
the rest of the country it's on the

79
00:02:50,669 --> 00:02:54,899
ballot in Washington it's on the ballot

80
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:58,020
in Colorado as well we will watch how

81
00:02:54,900 --> 00:03:00,270
those elections turn out as well and

82
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:02,490
we'll build off what happens here on

83
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:04,200
Tuesday no matter what but I just want

84
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:06,750
to be here today to again express my

85
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:08,549
strong support for legalization my

86
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:10,560
strong support for industrial hemp as

87
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:12,719
well my strong support for ending

88
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,759
prohibition having rational drug

89
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:16,710
policies in the state of Oregon and the

90
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:18,389
United States of America to move in

91
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:19,980
totally different direction and the

92
00:03:18,389 --> 00:03:21,689
other the last issue I'll touch you on

93
00:03:19,979 --> 00:03:22,619
this one that there where I think called

94
00:03:21,689 --> 00:03:25,199
the press conference here today to

95
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:26,849
emphasize as well is expansion of the

96
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:29,849
medical marijuana program to include

97
00:03:26,849 --> 00:03:34,289
post-traumatic stress and that to me is

98
00:03:29,849 --> 00:03:37,889
a reasonable and again totally vital

99
00:03:34,289 --> 00:03:39,750
step for the state to to take we have

100
00:03:37,889 --> 00:03:41,519
people in the state right now Oregon can

101
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:44,610
and should be a leader in the research

102
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:47,640
of how marijuana impacts ailments across

103
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:50,100
the board we have we have the growers

104
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:51,809
here we have the medical community here

105
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:54,509
and we obviously have the people in need

106
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:56,159
here we should put that together put the

107
00:03:54,509 --> 00:03:57,539
people who are suffering ailments

108
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:00,000
together the people doing research on

109
00:03:57,539 --> 00:04:02,129
marijuana and the growers and come up

110
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,500
with the data so we can say with great

111
00:04:02,129 --> 00:04:07,049
confidence that someone who is suffering

112
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:09,449
from PTSD with this strain of marijuana

113
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:11,610
or that stern of marijuana can expect

114
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:13,769
certain results some with chronic pain

115
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:16,379
with this strain of marijuana or veteran

116
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:17,759
or marijuana used in this way can expect

117
00:04:16,379 --> 00:04:19,199
this results the medical marijuana

118
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,939
program in my view needs to be

119
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,219
professionalized and we need to make

120
00:04:20,939 --> 00:04:25,620
sure that's having the best possible

121
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:26,070
outcomes for the patients who are on it

122
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:29,389
and went

123
00:04:26,069 --> 00:04:29,389
that I will just turn remember to you
