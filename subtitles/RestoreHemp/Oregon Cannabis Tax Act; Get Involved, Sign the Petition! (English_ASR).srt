1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,879
the name the Cannabis or you're calling

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:09,240
it The cannabis Tax Act cannabis Tax Act

3
00:00:05,878 --> 00:00:11,919
Right is based on the 1937 marijuana tax

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,599
act exactly and it's the way I use it

5
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:16,000
the analogy is it's like coming into a

6
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,519
film and the film's halfway through and

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,960
we don't know how we got here but I mean

8
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:22,039
people need to pull back and go wait a

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,599
minute at some point in history the

10
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:25,679
government stepped in and said they have

11
00:00:23,599 --> 00:00:27,480
the right to tell us what seeds we can

12
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:29,480
plant I mean the thing that we're doing

13
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,278
we're being so peaceful about it but

14
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:33,600
it's ins sanity when you really think

15
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:35,200
about it they've taken the right upon

16
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,719
themselves to tell us what seeds we can

17
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,559
plant I Gatewood grith woke me up to

18
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:42,760
this just think about it what seeds we

19
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:44,439
can plant we can debate uh processing

20
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:46,039
something in a laboratory but when the

21
00:00:44,439 --> 00:00:48,079
when the government steps in and says

22
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:49,559
you can't plant this seed then they've

23
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,719
taken the right to say you can't plant

24
00:00:49,558 --> 00:00:54,759
any seed and that crosses the line of

25
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:56,800
just basic common law I mean it's

26
00:00:54,759 --> 00:00:58,119
Insanity you need to get your mother

27
00:00:56,799 --> 00:01:01,078
your grandmother your brother your

28
00:00:58,119 --> 00:01:02,718
sister anybody that wants free Freedom

29
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:05,118
whether they're whether they smoke

30
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:07,159
marijuana or not and say and wake them

31
00:01:05,118 --> 00:01:09,599
up and say they've taken the freedom

32
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:11,600
away from us to grow a seed let's go

33
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:13,919
down there and mass get this petition

34
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:16,000
signed it should be done in two days if

35
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,478
people knew what it represented they

36
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,719
would do it immediately the the the

37
00:01:17,478 --> 00:01:21,319
880,000 signatures that are necessary

38
00:01:19,719 --> 00:01:24,078
should be done automatically whether you

39
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:26,719
smoke pot or not smoke just bring back

40
00:01:24,078 --> 00:01:28,959

43
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:34,920
right we we bow down to them like

44
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:36,599

45
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,879
rabbit man come on let's get over this

46
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:40,879
what I think is cool about is how many

47
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:44,759
groups of people get together and say

48

Here's a lot of cash out of my pocket

52
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:56,039

53
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,239
market and put it in the mainstream

54
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:59,118

59
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:09,199
out of paying their fair share and all

60
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:12,239

00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,759
thing about I mean not the government

66
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:27,200

67

69
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,080
down there in Washington going let's

70
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:35,239
let's sign this bill now yeah well you

71
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:37,599
know do you want to say something yeah

72
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:41,360
Paul you know I've got a question as to

73
00:02:37,598 --> 00:02:43,759
how we can get these is it 70,000

74
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,840
signatures right now we have uh just

75
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:49,679
over 50,000 signatures we need

76
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:51,759
87,134

77
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:55,360
signatures to put this thing on the

78
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:57,399
ballot so uh because some signatures

79
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,200
aren't valid they're illegible or they

80
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:01,360
aren't registered to vote we have to

81
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:05,719
turn in in excess of that so we want to

82
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:08,959
turn in at least 120 preferably 140,000

83
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:12,719
signatures so we still have about 20

84
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:14,280
weeks to go till July 6th to gather the

85
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:16,878
total number of signatures turn it into

86
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,479
the state and then that forces a vote on

87
00:03:16,878 --> 00:03:20,798
this question you can find out more

88
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:23,359
about that at cannabist taxa act.org

89
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:25,599
okay so what I'm the the question that I

90
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,519
have is how can we use the time value

91
00:03:25,598 --> 00:03:30,759
that we have in between now and where

92
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:33,400
we've got to get

93
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:37,158
and and and leverage that to the

94
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:39,039
greatest portion possible in terms of

95
00:03:37,158 --> 00:03:41,719
you said that someone can go to your

96
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:43,519
website they can download the form they

97
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:45,400
can fill it out they print it out sign

98
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,360
it and send it in okay so what I'm

99
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:50,920
trying to figure out is how can we use

100
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:53,439
social media because whether you are

101
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:56,158
whether you consider yourself a Democrat

102
00:03:53,438 --> 00:03:59,400
a republican an independent a

103
00:03:56,158 --> 00:04:00,438
Libertarian a a martian whoever you are

104
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,200
you know

105
00:04:00,438 --> 00:04:06,039
you have all of these people connected

106
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:08,759
to your friends family and co-workers

107
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:12,359
that are linked through your LinkedIn

108
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:15,438
your Twitter your Facebook somehow some

109
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:18,479
way you need to post this stuff into

110
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:21,120
your space so that people can share it

111
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:23,519
so that they can download this stuff in

112
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,439
the state of Oregon uh you know and if

113
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:27,758
you do not live in Oregon but you have

114
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:30,199
friends and family that you know that

115
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:34,600
know people that live in Oregon you need

116
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:37,879
to to get this into your social network

117
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:41,120
so by sharing it and tweeting it and

118
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:43,360
Facebooking it and and texting it or

119
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:47,038
whatever you're doing with it somehow we

120
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:50,080
need to use social networks to get this

121
00:04:47,038 --> 00:04:50,079
number done
