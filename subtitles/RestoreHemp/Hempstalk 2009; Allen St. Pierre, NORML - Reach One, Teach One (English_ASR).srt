1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:06,799
this state was the first state to

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:10,440
decriminalize marijuana the state of

3
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:13,240
Oregon was even ahead of California and

4
00:00:10,439 --> 00:00:15,518
changing the laws so it's no surprise to

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:18,920
me that this state continues to be at

6
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:18,920
the vanard of

7
00:00:19,518 --> 00:00:22,839
Reform hi

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:30,320
doctor and one of the reasons why the

9
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:33,280
state's policies are as functional as

10
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:35,600
they are is because people like Dr LC

11
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,359
for the better part of 20 years have

12
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,600
been helping citizens connect with

13
00:00:38,359 --> 00:00:43,079
doctors to get the medicine that they

14
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:45,840
need thank

15
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:47,679
you one of my heroes for

16
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:51,000
sure this

17
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:55,119
state has over I believe

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,359
25,000 registered patients at this

19
00:00:55,119 --> 00:01:00,759
point California doesn't have 25,000

20
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:04,159
registered patients you can go to some

21
00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:05,359
places like Vermont and there's like 250

22
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,240
registered

23
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:10,118
patients there's 250 registered patients

24
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:13,319
right here in front of me more or

25
00:01:10,118 --> 00:01:15,799
less this state has a functional medical

26
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:18,879
marijuana program is it perfect by no

27
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:22,200
means and there are certain parts of the

28
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:24,158
state you can be a serious victim of

29
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,400
geography yeah here in the greater

30
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,960
Portland area maybe in Salem and Eugene

31
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:33,520
proper you don't get herang that much

32
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:35,199
but go dead e East oh yeah yeah same

33
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:37,000
thing with California by the way you

34
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,478
know the coastal communities they

35
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,040
basically have medical marijuana retail

36
00:01:39,478 --> 00:01:45,039
access but the more easterly you go in a

37
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:50,159
place like California or Washington

38
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:52,680
State the harsher the laws get so here

39
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:55,439
we are in a great part of the state to

40
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:57,399
be making this argument I also want to

41
00:01:55,438 --> 00:02:00,239
recognize that we couldn't be here

42
00:01:57,399 --> 00:02:01,960
without activists being involved for 20

43
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:06,560
or 30

44
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:09,560
years Paul Stamford who heads up THC

45
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,400
Foundation has been working for 25 years

46
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:13,159
to reform laws at so many different

47
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,959
levels whether it's been hemp or medical

48
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:18,079
marijuana or regulating the legalization

49
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:20,360
of cannabis for adult

50
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:24,360
use Oregon

51
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:26,959
normal voter power and all the other

52
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:30,640
groups that predated them in the 1970s

53
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:32,479
and 80s in the 1980s the one of the

54
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:34,518
first votes for medical marij one of the

55
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:36,598
first legalization votes ever happened

56
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:39,120
Oregon marijuana

57
00:02:36,598 --> 00:02:41,439
initiative and that Legacy still lives

58
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,439
on

59
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:45,560
today you know here we are we're going

60
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:49,079
to be celebrating our own personal

61
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:52,158
freedom on a beautiful day in

62
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:54,239
Oregon and yet every 38 seconds in the

63
00:02:52,158 --> 00:02:56,399
United States statistically somebody's

64
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:59,080
getting arrested so while we're hanging

65
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,360
out here for five or six hours today

66
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:04,200
hundreds and hundreds of people will be

67
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,760
arrested over 2,000 people will be

68
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:09,000
arrested today in the United States for

69
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:12,439
marijuana 90% for possession

70
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,959
only so obviously I'm not here to

71
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:16,919
convince anybody or to deliver a pical

72
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:19,519
about the need to reform marijuana laws

73
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:21,598
we all know that to be the case all we

74
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,280
have to do is to do something what the

75
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:26,518
black churches told people to do in the

76
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:29,919
50s and 60s and that is reach one teach

77
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:32,879
one reach one teach one and the law is

78
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:35,280
where you live change the laws at the

79
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:37,598
local county level it percolates up to

80
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,199
the state level and then finally the

81
00:03:37,598 --> 00:03:42,359
nitwits in that little Dome building on

82
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:44,959
that little Hill in Washington DC

83
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:47,400
finally get it you know and there's a

84
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:49,360
reason why in Washington DC the

85
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:52,519
conservatives want to break up the ninth

86
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:56,159
circuit which is the California Oregon

87
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:59,280
Washington Alaska and Hawaii judicial

88
00:03:56,158 --> 00:04:01,679
circuits because here the Court

89
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,560
decisions that are coming out are so

90
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,480
different than the rest of the country

91
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:08,199
there is so much more respect for

92
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:10,798
personal freedom personal autonomy and

93
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:12,759
civil liberties on the west coast than

94
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,879
you get anywhere in the Midwest and

95
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:19,199
certainly even where I'm from in New

96
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:21,478
England so you know I always ask folks

97
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,040
were you born here in Oregon raise your

98
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:26,959
hand if you were born in

99
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:29,720
Oregon you are [ __ ] lucky how many of

100
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:31,319
you moved here to Oregon you are [ __ ]

101
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:34,400
[ __ ]

102
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:36,319
smart that really is how it works you

103
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:38,198
know we think we're all complicated

104
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:41,360
sophisticated

105
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:45,160
beasts but we're mammals and people

106
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:47,038
migrate so people will migrate to where

107
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:50,320
they think they have the most personal

108
00:04:47,038 --> 00:04:51,918
freedom and the most personal autonomy

109
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:54,079
the most amount of

110
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:56,279
self-preservation so it's no surprise

111
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:58,879
that people are moving in droves from

112
00:04:56,279 --> 00:05:01,239
the Iowa and Indian and Kies and

113
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:04,159
tennesses of the world and coming to

114
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:07,240
California and Oregon and Washington

115
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:09,400
because I think they rightly perceive

116
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,439
that they have more personal freedom and

117
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:13,959
the government respects their rights

118
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:15,680
more and there's a reason why people in

119
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:18,239
Washington want to get rid of the ninth

120
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:21,280
circuit because these trends go from

121
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,720
west to east there's nothing coming from

122
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:25,679
Boston nobody cares about any

123
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:28,479
socioeconomic legal Trends from

124
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:31,840
Wilmington [ __ ] Delaware or

125
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:34,478
Philadelphia or Washington DC the

126
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:37,399
serious social trends come from Portland

127
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:38,879
from Seattle from the Bay Area from the

128
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:40,478
Los Angeles

129
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:43,680
Basin

130
00:05:40,478 --> 00:05:45,680
so really take great pride in not only

131
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,120
walking around today and enjoying your

132
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,038
personal freedom and the great

133
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:52,360
environment that is Oregon but you got

134
00:05:50,038 --> 00:05:55,680
to fight all the time for

135
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:57,800
it your legislature every single year

136
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,240
tries to roll back and [ __ ] the

137
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:02,918
medical marijuana laws and every year

138
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:05,519
Oregon normal and others fight hard for

139
00:06:02,918 --> 00:06:07,680
your rights to keep these Liberties and

140
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:10,359
to keep expanding them so while you're

141
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:13,038
out here having a great time today

142
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:15,720
vending and buying all the great stuff

143
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:18,399
that makes this Festival

144
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:22,160
happen and listening to the great music

145
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:25,519
and speakers this is a First Amendment

146
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:27,840
freedom event never ever forget that at

147
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:30,240
its core it's all about your own

148
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:32,119
personal freedom and liberation

149
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,960
and we can't do our work in Washington

150
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:37,598
DC without knowing that you support us

151
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:39,839
and you have to know that for 39 years

152
00:06:37,598 --> 00:06:41,680
normal has supported all the people that

153
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:44,000
get arrested all the people that have to

154
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,280
fake drug test all the people that would

155
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,598
have their children taken away from them

156
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:50,239
because they use cannabis that they

157
00:06:48,598 --> 00:06:51,879
would have their student loans taken

158
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,079
away from them that they would have

159
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:56,560
their very own home taken away in a

160
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:59,639
civil forfeiture proceeding to have

161
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:02,038
professional licenses taken away like

162
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:05,840
commercial driver's licensed Tugboat

163
00:07:02,038 --> 00:07:08,759
captains nurses and doctors and lawyers

164
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:11,198
we're all in this together so thank you

165
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:13,280
so much for Oregon leading the way and

166
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:15,800
continuing to be at the Vanguard of

167
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:18,279
personal freedoms and Liberty marijuana

168
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:21,520
is nothing more but a metaphor here
