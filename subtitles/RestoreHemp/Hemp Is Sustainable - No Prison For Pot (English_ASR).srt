1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,919
uh industrial use you know i don't see

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:06,080
any harm and uh

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:07,919
there's a lot of good uses for it uh

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,199
you know people fight it because of the

5
00:00:07,918 --> 00:00:10,480
uh

6
00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:11,919
well from

7
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,519
the backbone of it through william

8
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:15,679
randall person's paper industry i guess

9
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,278
that's where it first started but

10
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,039
i don't mind the industrial use i mean

11
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:21,600
mix rope fine rope find clothing find

12
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:23,600
paper whatever

13
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,800
anything you can make out of a

14
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,039
hydrocarbon you can make out of a

15
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,839
carbohydrate there's no reason to be

16
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:32,000
burning fossil fuels when we don't have

17
00:00:28,839 --> 00:00:33,280
to if you can grow him

18
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,840
properly

19
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,920
it is a material that contributes to

20
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,800
sustainable agriculture

21
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,480
because the tonnage of carbon removed

22
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:44,159
from the air in the form of carbon

23
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:45,759
dioxide

24
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:47,839
is high

25
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:50,799
relative to the amount of carbon removed

26
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:53,840
from the air by other plants

27
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:55,519
like trees this is a modified 1983

28
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,800
mercedes-benz turbo diesel and the only

29
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,719
thing that we've done differently is put

30
00:00:56,799 --> 00:00:59,839
lots of wonderful stickers on the car

31
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,558
and put

32
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,920
biodiesel fuel in the tank

33
00:01:02,558 --> 00:01:06,719
that's it

34
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,879
no modifications

35
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:12,158
also mercedes-benz right now has a model

36
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:14,879
420m series believe it or not that's got

37
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:16,479
uh hemp composite plastic dashboards and

38
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:18,798
door paneling

39
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:20,719
and um they're discovering that it

40
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:23,200
biodegrades when it when it breaks upon

41
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:25,519
impact it doesn't break sharply so it's

42
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,040
less likely to injure a person and we've

43
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:28,640
uh let's see we've been on the road for

44
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,640
six weeks now

45
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,560
got six thousand miles on the car that

46
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,280
that's totally on him

47
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:40,000
and uh we've got uh another six weeks to

48
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:41,280
go roughly before we end our tour in d.c

49
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,078
there's a lot of problems that have to

50
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:47,280
be solved and this can't solve a number

51
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:51,039
of bits it's fiber strength is up on the

52
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,960
on the order of 5000 psi

53
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,320
so you get a fiber strength that's

54
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:56,000
equivalent to some of the toughest

55
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:58,559
strongest woods

56
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,599
when you process hemp fiber

57
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,280
using a hydrogen peroxide process

58
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:05,599
you can control the pollution more

59
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,399
effectively than using chlorine

60
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:10,799
processing which is used for paper

61
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:14,479
the hemp that comes out of this process

62
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:16,879
can be made into oriented strand boards

63
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:20,878
oriented strand board is the largest

64
00:02:16,878 --> 00:02:23,439
growing sector of the materials industry

65
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:25,280
for construction

66
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:30,239
oriented strand board can be made with

67
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:32,959
hemp fiber having a modulus of 6000 psi

68
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,080
about twice the strength of ordinary

69
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,280
um

70
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,040
uh particle boards this makes

71
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,759
hemp fiber

72
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:43,280
bonded with its own natural

73
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:45,280
binders

74
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,719
a suitable material

75
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,719
for underlayment

76
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,560
sheathing and

77
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:55,280
roofing

78
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:58,280
the substrate in houses and housing

79
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,280
construction

80
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,599
you
