1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:05,640
you know I'm really excited that uh

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:07,799
marijuana is legal in Oregon and that

3
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:11,039
12,000 people won't go to jail this year

4
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:11,040
for cannabis

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:19,839
yay so as we are working toward

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:23,118
implementing that law we've come across

7
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:25,240
some problems um and that the measure 91

8
00:00:23,118 --> 00:00:26,879
committee decided that measure 91 was a

9
00:00:25,239 --> 00:00:29,439
good first draft and they want to do

10
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:32,640
something different and so we've had a a

11
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:35,000
Time of coming together and really

12
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,840
communicating what our community needs

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,519
because the measure 91 committee did not

14
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:44,520
follow what measure 91 said measure 91

15
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:47,800
said that om should remain untouched it

16
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,399
said it three different times but

17
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:51,320
because it wasn't a constitutional

18
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:52,759
amendment put the sign down buddy

19
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:55,000
because it wasn't a constitutional

20
00:00:52,759 --> 00:00:56,519
amendment they changed it they took it

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,079
as a good first draft and they're doing

22
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:03,800
what they want so right now tomorrow M

23
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:05,319
day SB 844 is going to be adopted

24
00:01:03,799 --> 00:01:07,560
there's some discussion if it's already

25
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:08,919
been adopted or if it's not adopted I

26
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,240
think that it's pretty as close to

27
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:13,000
adopted as it's going to be until they

28
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:15,239
actually take care of it and then

29
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,200
they've got- s amendments too so they're

30
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:21,759
trying to alter it sentence by sentence

31
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,118
literally like it's literally sentence

32
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,759
by sentence change this word adopt this

33
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:28,759
thing but what they've done is they've

34
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:31,560
messed up our grows you guys they messed

35
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:33,399
up our possession limit for our plants

36
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,439
and so that's a really big deal because

37
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:37,599
now a bunch of patients that were going

38
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:39,478
to have medicine from their Growers

39
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:40,959
their Growers cannot give them that

40
00:01:39,478 --> 00:01:42,840
medicine for free because they're not

41
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:44,959
going to have a surplus of medicine to

42
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,960
be able to give away for free and there

43
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:49,478
won't be as many Growers able to help as

44
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:51,319
many of these Patients Out they've put

45
00:01:49,478 --> 00:01:53,280
on some pretty strict reporting

46
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:56,959
requirements and they've put in some

47
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:59,159
things like um inspections for grows if

48
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:01,839
you designate somebody else to grow for

49
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:04,118
you then that person would be subject to

50
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,359
inspection there's a lot of things like

51
00:02:04,118 --> 00:02:08,399
that that are very alarming in this

52
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:11,520
legislation and so what I would invite

53
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:15,919
all of you to do is to read it get

54
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:18,519
involved show up in Salem on Mondays and

55
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:20,559
Wednesdays at 5:00 the measure 91

56
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:23,920
committee meets and they have done a

57
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:26,680
really good job about listening to what

58
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:29,518
we have to say they recently called

59
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:31,959
themselves a monkey with a gun you guys

60
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:36,519
they called themselves a monkey with a

61
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:39,719
gun over our program we know what we

62
00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:43,400
need so we need everybody here to show

63
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:46,120
up and tell them what we need now after

64
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:48,680
they're done with this 844 Amendment or

65
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:50,759
the SB 844 and the Amendments that go

66
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:53,879
with it they're actually going to turn

67
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:56,639
toward measure 91 and measure 91 they're

68
00:02:53,878 --> 00:02:59,000
going to be looking at ret taxing and

69
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:01,359
the taxing structures that were laid in

70
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,560
place are going going to be gone they're

71
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,360
going to look at implementing moratorium

72
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,039
and they're going to look at

73
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:08,840
implementing moratorium without putting

74
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:13,000
it to a vote there some things that they

75
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:14,759
are not allowed to do in measure 91 but

76
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,519
because it's a legislative session

77
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:19,598
they're going to be allowed to do what

78
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:21,560
they want and so it's really up to us

79
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:23,518
we're the ones that voted it through

80
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:25,158
we're the ones that wanted it we're the

81
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,680
ones that have been screaming out to be

82
00:03:25,158 --> 00:03:31,039
regulated now we have to hold them

83
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:33,200
accountable in this process C we have to

84
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:34,598
show up we have to tell them what we

85
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:37,000
think about what they're doing to our

86
00:03:34,598 --> 00:03:38,719
grow limits we have to show up and tell

87
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,799
them what we think about taxing our

88
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:44,359
medicine or taxing recreational Cannabis

89
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:46,400
we have to show up and hold these people

90
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:48,680
accountable because if you think they

91
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,719
know what they're doing I want to remind

92
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:52,640
you again he called the there was a

93
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:55,919
member of the committee that stood sat

94
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:58,119
there and said we are monkeys with a gun

95
00:03:55,919 --> 00:04:00,078
they are they're monkeys with a gun you

96
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,759
guys they do not know what they're doing

97
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:03,280
if you saw a monkey with a gun running

98
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:04,919
through this Plaza right now what would

99
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,719
you do you would try to disarm the

100
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:10,078
monkey and you would run you would not

101
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:12,560
just leave the baby the with unattended

102
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:15,079
with the monkey with the gun so we have

103
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,600
a baby which is our program which is

104
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:19,720
measure 91 and we have a committee

105
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,359

medicine for the last year or you lost

124

00:05:20,918 --> 00:05:24,719
listening and read the information

131
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:27,199
there's the Oregon legislative

132
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,560
information system you can go on there

133
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:31,079

you can read it for yourself you can

135
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:37,079

136
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:37,080
to be underinformative

137
00:05:59,478 --> 00:06:04,038

space it's not enough we we won't have

139
00:06:04,038 --> 00:06:08,318
enough medicine and then if they want to

140
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,918
have the medical program stimulate the

141
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,919
