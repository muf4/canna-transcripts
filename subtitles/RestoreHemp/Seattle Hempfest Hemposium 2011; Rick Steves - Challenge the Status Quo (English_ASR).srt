1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,000
ladies and gentlemen Mr Rick

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:09,519
Steves thank you very

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:11,519
much and it feels good to come out of

4
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:13,439
the closet doesn't it isn't it a strange

5
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,160
sort of concept that we have to come out

6
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:18,679
of the concept about something that just

7
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:20,439
feels like a very basic civil liberty uh

8
00:00:18,679 --> 00:00:22,239
you know you've heard all of the um

9
00:00:20,439 --> 00:00:24,079
talking points and so on from the the

10
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:26,038
main stage and so on and I thought this

11
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:27,278
is for the the eager students here at

12
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:30,199
hemp posium so I'm just going to give

13
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:32,759
you a little background on uh my

14
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:34,640
experience in speaking out on this issue

15
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:36,960
in public not at Hempfest it's easy to

16
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,239
talk about it here but it's tougher to

17
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,239
talk about it you know at your parent

18
00:00:39,238 --> 00:00:43,238
teacher Association meetings or with

19
00:00:41,238 --> 00:00:45,359
your friends down the street or or or at

20
00:00:43,238 --> 00:00:47,399
the supermarket or something like this

21
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:49,679
so I want to talk about that I've also

22
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:51,558
had some interesting um challenge to try

23
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:54,198
to understand the other side better

24
00:00:51,558 --> 00:00:55,919
respect the other side understand what

25
00:00:54,198 --> 00:00:58,119
motivates them because you know I think

26
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,198
it's good citizenship all around and

27
00:00:58,119 --> 00:01:02,280
it's just awareness raising and and life

28
00:01:00,198 --> 00:01:03,719
in people sharing other people's

29
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,118
challenges and how they've succeeded in

30
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:06,439
what they've learned where we can move

31
00:01:05,118 --> 00:01:09,118
forward on this so that's what I want to

32
00:01:06,438 --> 00:01:12,879
talk about uh a little while ago I had

33
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:15,400
dinner with uh Gil kow's sort of lead

34
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:17,239
narcotics guy in Seattle wonderful man

35
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:19,359
beautiful guy I just him and I kind of

36
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:21,798
clicked and I didn't realize but Carol

37
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:24,078
lowski had sent him out to listen to me

38
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:26,159
give my talks around the Pua Sound area

39
00:01:24,078 --> 00:01:28,519
just to see what hempest kind of people

40
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,600
were doing you know and and uh I sat

41
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:33,359
down with him and we had a great dinner

42
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:36,599
he disagreed with everything I said

43
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:39,840
except my contention that you can make a

44
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:43,478
very good case that the mature adult

45
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:46,520
Usef marijuana is a civil liberty but he

46
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:50,920
said you've got to cover the other bases

47
00:01:46,519 --> 00:01:53,078
Driving Access to kids addiction abuse

48
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:55,599
education all this kind of stuff so it's

49
00:01:53,078 --> 00:01:57,199
a very interesting um it's a very

50
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:59,319
interesting sort of challenge that we

51
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,920
have here he asked me after that dinner

52
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:03,519
he said why he said you're some you know

53
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,039
well-off white guy in the severage you

54
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:06,200
could smoke pot no problem at all you

55
00:02:05,039 --> 00:02:08,800
can invite your friends over and have a

56
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:11,439
great party no problem why are you in

57
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:14,200
this fight and I thought about it and

58
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:16,759
he's right uh you know most of us can

59
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:18,839
smoke with discretion and be fine uh but

60
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:20,919
there really is a matter of principle

61
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:23,878
about this and uh I thought about it and

62
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:25,318
I thought I am really into travel you

63
00:02:23,878 --> 00:02:27,479
know I'm a travel writer I've spent a

64
00:02:25,318 --> 00:02:30,919
third of my adult life just traveling I

65
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:34,079
just love going places and to me

66
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:36,559
high is a place and I really treasure

67
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,800
that and when I want to go there I want

68
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,519
to go there I I don't need my government

69
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,239
to give me a passport for that place now

70
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,879
there are cases when our government can

71
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:46,200
tell us we can't go there for various

72
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:48,079
reasons and we got to live with it you

73
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:50,119
know you can argue about Cuba but you

74
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,519
can't go there all right there's reasons

75
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:54,080
um when it comes to high I just don't

76
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:55,480
think there's a good reason I I mean

77
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,599
they've got wrong reasons they've got

78
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:59,238
reasons based on fear and lies and

79
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:01,878
what's going to get them elected but

80
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:04,439
there's no real honest reason why we

81
00:03:01,878 --> 00:03:07,399
cannot go

82
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:09,479
there I have thought about this a lot

83
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:12,120
and you know basically a lot of us just

84
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:14,238
like to smoke pot uh most of my friends

85
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:16,120
most of my business associates uh you

86
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,319
know if you locked up everybody in our

87
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:20,680
community that likes to smoke pot

88
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:22,639
recreationally it would be a major blow

89
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:25,560
to our communities to our businesses and

90
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:28,039
so on and it's just sort of my theme

91
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:30,239
that the mature adult recreational

92
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:31,519
consumption of marijuana is a Liberty I

93
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,158
don't like to mince around I don't like

94
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,360
to dance around it I just like to say

95
00:03:33,158 --> 00:03:37,000
that really clearly I mean of course

96
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,360
medical marijuana is a very serious

97
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,759
thing my passion is this civil liberties

98
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,000
thing that's why I'm working closely

99
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:45,000
with the ACLU that's been my theme as a

100
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,400
board member with normal for the last uh

101
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,039
10 years now again our challenge is how

102
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,719
do we protect this civil liberty and at

103
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:55,400
the same time deal with the downside of

104
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:57,680
pot marijuana is a drug you can have all

105
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:00,239
sorts of ideals you know initiative

106
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,760
505's got great great ideals respect

107
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,360
their idealism but I live in a reality

108
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:06,679
out there I live in a reality where

109
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:09,560
800,000 Americans were arrested last

110
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:11,640
year they weren't rich white guys they

111
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,799
were poor people and people of color

112
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:14,559
they're people for the rest of their

113
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:16,478
lives they're going to have a a cross to

114
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,839
bear they're going to be at a further

115
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:21,918
disadvantage and that's just flat out

116
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:24,159
wrong and the irony is people who make

117
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:25,680
that law are afraid of them and because

118
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,040
of that law they've got more to be

119
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,840
afraid of we've reached a point in our

120
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:32,639
society where if we lock up any more

121
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:34,198
people it's going to get more dangerous

122
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,840
you know what I mean you take

123
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:38,720
non-violent people who got in trouble

124
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:40,279
for some experimental drug use putting

125
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,520
them into prison then they come out

126
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:43,638
they've been to finishing school and

127
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:46,639
they can't get a job they're going to

128
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:50,280
become part of that criminal system we

129
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:53,918
need to take ideas like this and mess up

130
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:55,839
otherwise you know uh polite dinners and

131
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:57,198
uh challenge people to say where are you

132
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:59,198
getting your information how do you

133
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,478
really know that there's so many

134
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,759
exciting things and I've been at this

135
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:03,719
for 10 years and I've learned these

136
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,720
exciting points that you can just inject

137
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,160
into conversations if you distill it

138
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,960
down to a bumper sticker it's going to

139
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:11,160
be hard on drugs or soft on drugs and

140
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:12,879
we're going to lose we've got to get

141
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:15,479
beyond that we've got to get enough of

142
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:17,839
an attention span so we can educate

143
00:05:15,478 --> 00:05:19,519
people about this you know you can't do

144
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:21,879
it on public on Commercial television

145
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:23,318
very well we do it on on public

146
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:25,560
television I won't do a pledge drive

147
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:27,520
right now but I just spent an hour at

148
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:29,120
kcts with the weekly with a wonderful

149
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:30,359
panel of people that are co-sponsoring

150
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,399
these inititive

151
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,400
and we really got some great information

152
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:36,638
out there but it is a trick to get that

153
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:38,159
information out we produced a half hour

154
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,079
video with the ACLU you might have seen

155
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,439
it you can see it on online marijuana

156
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:44,318
time for a discussion I just love that

157
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:46,000
thing because it raises awareness I was

158
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:48,759
so proud to be a part of

159
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,519
that we wrote that very carefully with

160
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:52,840
all the legalistic sensitivity so that

161
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:55,079
we could buy time to put it on Cairo or

162
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:56,799
KO or King you know we paid them money

163
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:58,758
to produce it in their Studios and I

164
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,960
mean it's just like you know a th Master

165
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:02,400
if you pay the money you can can put it

166
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:06,359
on TV but they wouldn't let us air that

167
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:07,679
show except once after Girls Gone Wild

168
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,759
at about 2: a.m. you know you could put

169
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,918
it on and uh but it's just like evil

170
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:14,680
information because it challenges this

171
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:17,120
status quo with a thoughtful reasonable

172
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:19,560
harm reduction app Point uh approach to

173
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,478
marijuana drug policy now so getting

174
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,959
back to this how are we going to make it

175
00:06:21,478 --> 00:06:25,000
clear that this is a civil liberty which

176
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:27,318
my friend on the other side said is a

177
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,598
very strong argument but you got to deal

178
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:32,120
with the political reality marijuana is

179
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:34,079
is a drug we're not promoting a use of a

180
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:36,079
drug we're promoting the right to use it

181
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:38,000
if you want to I've never promoted

182
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:39,918
marijuana I'm really careful about that

183
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,160
I promote the use of it as a civil

184
00:06:39,918 --> 00:06:45,240
liberty I think people understandably

185
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:47,439
need to hear us say that drugs can be

186
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:49,560
abused it to acknowledge it is a problem

187
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:52,000
in our society there is an educational

188
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:53,918
component of this the drinking and

189
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,959
smoking and then driving while

190
00:06:53,918 --> 00:06:59,680
intoxicated is not an issue that we can

191
00:06:55,959 --> 00:07:02,198
wish away the idealists in 505 camp you

192
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,759
know again I wish it was I wish we could

193
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:06,280
sell the 505 initiative but I want to I

194
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:08,598
want to put out an initiative that can

195
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:10,878
be embraced and everywhere you talk

196
00:07:08,598 --> 00:07:12,959
outside of Hempfest parents in the

197
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:15,120
suburbs don't want their kid hit by

198
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:17,198
somebody who's high on something that's

199
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,319
not going to go away and we need to deal

200
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,319
with that and we don't have enough

201
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:22,000
scientific evidence now to deal with it

202
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,400
properly we need to get something where

203
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,199
we can have some funds and a drug that

204
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:28,679
can be tested by human beings I just

205
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,560
spent a day up at a pharmaceutical

206
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:32,400
convention up in past effort there with

207
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,839
a bunch of doctors and Pharmacists and

208
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:36,519
scientists and professors all day long

209
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:38,598
the topic was the pharmaceutical nature

210
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:40,598
of marijuana and it was fascinating to

211
00:07:38,598 --> 00:07:43,399
me these are like 300 very highly

212
00:07:40,598 --> 00:07:45,478
trained uh Medical Specialists they

213
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:47,318
could not the only evidence they were

214
00:07:45,478 --> 00:07:50,360
using was evidence of the effect of

215
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:51,720
marijuana on rats and hamsters because

216
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:54,400
it was illegal and they couldn't use

217
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:55,599
evidence of uh marijuana on people they

218
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:57,158
couldn't acknowledge even that people

219
00:07:55,598 --> 00:07:59,560
would use it you see I mean there's that

220
00:07:57,158 --> 00:08:01,800
kind of a disconnect right now between

221
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:03,478
science and acceptable science and the

222
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:06,158
reality and I just said you know you

223
00:08:03,478 --> 00:08:08,120
don't need to get this hamster High you

224
00:08:06,158 --> 00:08:10,199
know just go across the street and talk

225
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,360
to somebody and ask them what it's like

226
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:13,598
I mean it's that simple but they

227
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:16,439
couldn't do it so we have that

228
00:08:13,598 --> 00:08:18,839
challenge um so you got this drinking

229
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:20,639
and driving concern you got the uh the

230
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:22,638
whole fear of children and getting their

231
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,680
uh hands on drugs and uh this has got to

232
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,158
be addressed and it's got to be

233
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,639
addressed smartly and that's an issue

234
00:08:25,158 --> 00:08:29,000
that is near and dear to any parents

235
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:31,038
Hearts I often wonder why our generation

236
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,200
didn't just grow into power and

237
00:08:31,038 --> 00:08:36,000
marijuana would become regulated and

238
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,919
taxed and and like alcohol and so on but

239
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,200
it didn't happen why because we became

240
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:42,038
we became parents we worry about our

241
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:44,000
kids and then we are victimized by a lot

242
00:08:42,038 --> 00:08:45,480
of government proper uh sponsored weer

243
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,240
Madness kind of propaganda that twists

244
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,560
the truth and they tell us it's 20 times

245
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,000
as strong as it was when we were kids or

246
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:52,439
whatever and this kind of stuff and we

247
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,799
buy it so I want to kind of talk a

248
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,120
little bit about this sort of uh

249
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:58,359
information this angle on the issue and

250
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:00,919
I want to give you um just sort of my

251
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:03,399
take on it as a traveler travel

252
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:06,679
writer I bring a European sort of

253
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:08,519
sensibility I think to the the whole

254
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:09,879
discussion and as I mentioned I spend a

255
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:11,120
lot of time in Europe that's my beat I

256
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:12,600
write guide books about Europe and make

257
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,120
this TV show on public television and so

258
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:16,959
on and uh it's so interesting to me how

259
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,078
America brags about how we are the land

260
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:20,719
of the pursuit of happiness and you know

261
00:09:19,078 --> 00:09:22,199
grab live life with gusto and everything

262
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,200
like that and when you travel a lot you

263
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,519
come home and there's a sort of a

264
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,440
culture shock in reverse and you realize

265
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:28,799
we are really quite an uptight Society

266
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:31,320
in a lot of ways compared to Europeans

267
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:33,319
uh uh you know uh I've I've taken groups

268
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,360
to spas in Germany where everybody just

269
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:37,360
kind of gets naked and relaxes and my

270
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,959
people won't even go in I mean I just

271
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,399
can't believe it they're just so afraid

272
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:44,078
of that when I produce my TV show if it

273
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:45,720
has any any nudity on it it won't be

274
00:09:44,078 --> 00:09:47,879
aired in the more conservative parts of

275
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:49,639
our country my show which you've

276
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:52,399
probably seen on Channel 9 actually has

277
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:55,000
to be aired after 10:00 in parts of our

278
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:58,078
country because we show 500y old marble

279
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,839
penises and you know 800 year old canvas

280
00:09:58,078 --> 00:10:03,559
nudes uh breasts you know and uh we have

281
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:05,720
a law that that terrorizes stations into

282
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:09,439
shielding people's eyes from this kind

283
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:11,440
of end of uh of of our world and uh when

284
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,399
you travel you realize there are

285
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,920
different ways to address these sort of

286
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:17,278
edgy issues but here in the United

287
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:19,278
States I think we are sort of fearful

288
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:20,720
and driven into sort of a compliance

289
00:10:19,278 --> 00:10:22,759
with what we think is the norm and I

290
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,440
don't think it really is so we have

291
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:25,838
these these sort of uptight areas and

292
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:27,680
and for me the whole thing about

293
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,480
marijuana was just one lie too many one

294
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:31,479
bit of uptightness too many and of

295
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,920
course when I go to your for my friends

296
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:36,079
over there a joint is about as exciting

297
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:37,958
as a can of beer uh it's just uh you

298
00:10:36,078 --> 00:10:40,159
know it's very very clear that we've got

299
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:41,838
this prohibition on marijuana that is uh

300
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:43,519
something that is very costly to our

301
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:45,279
society and when you go to other

302
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,720
societies they care about drug abuse and

303
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:48,958
Drug rated problems just as much as we

304
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:52,839
do but they approach it in a much more

305
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:55,078
Progressive and pragmatic way um so I

306
00:10:52,839 --> 00:10:58,800
speak out it uh you know from that

307
00:10:55,078 --> 00:11:00,479
perspective um when I uh part of my work

308
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:02,958
as a travelers to get people out of

309
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,639
their comfort zones I think this is a

310
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:06,239
fundamental thing about travel is you

311
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:07,879
you you hang out with people who find

312
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,759
different tooths to be self-evident in

313
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:11,120
god-given you look at something that

314
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:13,399
used to be scary and then you get to

315
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,000
know the person and it's not scary a

316
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:17,159
whirling dervish I mean looks kind of

317
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,360
freaky to a lot of Americans but if you

318
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:20,120
talk to the guy and you find out what

319
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,959
he's thinking when he's whirling around

320
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:24,600
it becomes a beautiful thing it becomes

321
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:26,439
a very beautiful thing you know F A lot

322
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,440
of people are all uptight about F gr

323
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,959
because you have to force speed the

324
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,760
geese well you can go to a goose Farm in

325
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:32,799
France and learn a little bit about the

326
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:35,519
situation and it becomes quite a bit

327
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:37,519
different uh I have so much fun in my TV

328
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:39,839
show of trying to expose people to

329
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:41,879
things we went to Iran very frightening

330
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,760
place I was afraid before I went to Iran

331
00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:45,320
got there and I realized uh they're just

332
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:46,838
as afraid of us as we are of them and if

333
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:49,560
we can just meet each other all of a

334
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:51,720
sudden it becomes much uh sort of more

335
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:53,399
potential to get together I love I've

336
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:55,480
just got something in my nature to try

337
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:57,078
to get people out of their comfort zones

338
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,879
in a constructive way I remember when my

339
00:11:57,078 --> 00:12:00,359
boy was about 3 years old when we were

340
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:01,838
having you know saying thank you for

341
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,278
table Grace and invite Grandma and

342
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,880
Grandpa over I teach my son at the end

343
00:12:03,278 --> 00:12:07,879
of the prayer to go Allah Allah Allah

344
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:09,360
and it just to freak out my dad you know

345
00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:11,559
uh and

346
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,879
uh we can get people out of their

347
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:15,039
comfort zones when we travel and I think

348
00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:16,639
it's a good thing to get people out of

349
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:18,799
their comfort zones here too I mean to

350
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:20,320
me Hempfest for a lot of people is uh

351
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:21,599
out of their comfort zone wouldn't it be

352
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,920
great if a lot of people who don't know

353
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,120
anything about this issue could come

354
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:27,078
here and just feel this mellow Vibe and

355
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,839
see the police and the mayor of Seattle

356
00:12:27,078 --> 00:12:31,439
yesterday on stage and and see this kind

357
00:12:28,839 --> 00:12:34,040
of commment to uh you know just fun and

358
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:36,360
civil liberties and uh and compassionate

359
00:12:34,039 --> 00:12:38,799
compassionate medical use and pragmatic

360
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:42,079
harm reduction so it's a fun challenge

361
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:43,559
for all of us here um and uh when it

362
00:12:42,078 --> 00:12:45,439
comes to the whole marijuana thing when

363
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:48,159
you go to Europe it's hard to paint a

364
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,639
broad stroke here because it's easy to

365
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:51,240
say Europe's this way but the fact is

366
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:52,440
there's uh 20 different countries and

367
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,959
they all have different rules on this

368
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,839
sort of thing some of them are more

369
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:57,719
regressive than we are most of them are

370
00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:00,160
much more Progressive than we are

371
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:02,160
generally in Europe they have drug

372
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:04,278
policies motivated by pragmatic harm

373
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:06,480
reduction for eight years of the

374
00:13:04,278 --> 00:13:08,078
administration before Obama any

375
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,320
proposition about drug policy that was

376
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:11,278
submitted to our government if it had

377
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:13,278
the word harm reduction in it it was

378
00:13:11,278 --> 00:13:15,000
rejected out of hand that was code for

379
00:13:13,278 --> 00:13:17,559
legalization they would not consider

380
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,440
anything that was not incarceration

381
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:21,679
based rather than pragmatic harm

382
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,760
reduction based well in Europe they

383
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:24,879
really are concerned about drug abuse uh

384
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:26,958
you know they lose a lot of people to

385
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:29,360
heroin over to us so do we how are you

386
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:31,278
going to solve that we do it by lock

387
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,800
people up we do it with misinformation

388
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:35,360
and fear they do it with pragmatic harm

389
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:38,078
reduction in Europe they believe if you

390
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,399
take crime out of the equation if you

391
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:41,519
take the money and the violence out of

392
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:43,958
the equation you can treat drug abuse as

393
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:47,600
a health problem and an education

394
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:47,599
challenge that is a beautiful

395
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:58,360
thing it's really fun to see the

396
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:00,519
European approach to this um and Europe

397
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:04,120
has a concern about hard drugs and they

398
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:07,240
put marijuana in with alcohol and uh and

399
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:08,959
uh tobacco as a a drug that can be um

400
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:10,919
not healthy for you and so on but it's

401
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:15,159
not going to be treated like hard drugs

402
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:17,159
and uh I think with that approach um you

403
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:18,399
can look back and see why did marijuana

404
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:20,240
end up where it ended up it's a

405
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:22,759
fascinating story uh I was hanging out

406
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,480
with Bud Eagle Crow remember him he was

407
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:26,159
the guy who deputized Elvis Presley to

408
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,639
be the drug marshal in the United States

409
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:31,039
back back in Nixon's Rule and when when

410
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:32,639
Nixon decided to uh well Nixon was just

411
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:34,439
pissed off about all the hippies who are

412
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:35,959
standing against his Vietnam policies I

413
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,480
guess and he thought well the main drug

414
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:39,198
of all those hippies those pnck is

415
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:42,600
marijuana I'm going to put their drug in

416
00:14:39,198 --> 00:14:44,278
with LSD and uh heroin or whatever and

417
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,639
from that day on I think marijuana has

418
00:14:44,278 --> 00:14:48,320
been tossed in out of where it should be

419
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:50,360
in with hard more addictive more

420
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,440
destructive drugs and not with alcohol

421
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:55,240
where I believe it should

422
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:57,240
be when we look at European European

423
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:58,839
treatment of marijuana you find you look

424
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:02,440
at their website in the EU website

425
00:14:58,839 --> 00:15:06,199
there's there's no um there there's no

426
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:08,480
like um uh well where you find it is

427
00:15:06,198 --> 00:15:09,958
problematic cannabis use if you search

428
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:13,199
and search and search for marijuana

429
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:16,000
there is problematic cannabis use I

430
00:15:13,198 --> 00:15:19,120
think in Germany they no in France they

431
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,639
had a a belief that young men would

432
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:23,759
smoke marijuana so they would be more

433
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:25,919
comfortable uh courting women and uh

434
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:28,039
they actually had flirting con

435
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:29,559
consultations to help guys be more

436
00:15:28,039 --> 00:15:31,599
comfortable with girls without having to

437
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:33,039
smoke pot there's you know it seems kind

438
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,720
of wacky but what the point is they're

439
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:37,599
thinking out of the box in order to help

440
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:39,480
people not uh get into drugs when they

441
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,120
don't need to get into drugs rather than

442
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:45,440
criminalizing it um when you think about

443
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:47,799
how Europe handles its soft drug or just

444
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,079
any drug abuse problems it is always it

445
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:50,559
just seems to me it's always more

446
00:15:49,078 --> 00:15:53,359
pragmatic than we do for instance

447
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:55,599
alcohol when I'm in uh Scandinavia in

448
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:58,480
May and June I'm always impressed by how

449
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:00,040
many wild drunk teenagers are roaming

450
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,000
around town in the back of decorated

451
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:03,759
trucks pickup trucks and and flatbed

452
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,440
trucks and then I ask my friends what's

453
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:06,639
going on it's graduation time and all

454
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,319
these kids kids are just getting really

455
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:11,480
drunk and their parents are hosting the

456
00:16:09,318 --> 00:16:13,639
kers and the deal is the parents will

457
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:15,039
rent a car a truck with a driver the

458
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:16,759
parents will get together and have a

459
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:18,519
keger in each house or apartment or

460
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:20,759
whatever and the kids will go from house

461
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:23,360
to house uh being hosted by their

462
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:24,759
parents and just get really blitzed and

463
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,959
uh the parents know that nobody's going

464
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:28,519
to be drinking and driving now parents

465
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:30,479
don't want their kids to drink and and

466
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:31,959
drive uh you know in America we parents

467
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,639
tell our kids promise me you won't drink

468
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:35,239
on graduation and never get in a car

469
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:37,039
with somebody else is driving well

470
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:38,240
people kids promise that but in very B

471
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:40,799
in the United States because we have

472
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:43,959
this just say no approach without the

473
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:45,559
pragmatism and in the reality kids lie

474
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:47,599
kids get in cars where people have been

475
00:16:45,559 --> 00:16:50,278
drinking and on graduation every year

476
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:53,519
kids die in Scandinavia the parents are

477
00:16:50,278 --> 00:16:55,600
more pragmatic kids don't have to lie

478
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:57,720
nobody drives and drinks kids have a

479
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:00,040
great time everybody's just wasted the

480
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:02,240
next day but uh it's a it's a it's a

481
00:17:00,039 --> 00:17:04,519
Scandinavian pragmatic approach to a

482
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,400
drug abuse problem that'd be a very

483
00:17:04,519 --> 00:17:08,400
tough sell here in the United States but

484
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,880
from a Scandinavian point of view that

485
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:13,559
is smart drug policy you know don't do

486
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:16,120
the just say no thing hire a driver in a

487
00:17:13,558 --> 00:17:17,240
truck and host the keger now when you

488
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:19,359
think about that just for a little

489
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:22,078
something like alcohol similar uh

490
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:24,519
pragmatism is in other soft drugs and in

491
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:25,879
hard drugs when you go around Europe uh

492
00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:28,199
you'll find they have a very very

493
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:30,559
pragmatic approach to hard drug abuse

494
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:32,640
last year in the un States 18,000

495
00:17:30,558 --> 00:17:35,160
Americans died of heroin overdoses in

496
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,559
Europe 10,000 died it's a major problem

497
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,960
on both sides of the Atlantic here in

498
00:17:36,558 --> 00:17:40,200
the United States we lock up a lot of

499
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:42,319
hard drug users in Europe uh they don't

500
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,798
lock them up they they treat them as

501
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:45,678
people who have medical problems they

502
00:17:43,798 --> 00:17:47,519
need to get their lives back on track if

503
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:49,080
you I was just in Switzerland and when

504
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:50,918
you want to go to a public restroom I

505
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:53,359
went to a Starbucks went downstairs to

506
00:17:50,919 --> 00:17:55,600
to go to the bathroom blue lights blue

507
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:58,240
lights in the Starbucks toilet and then

508
00:17:55,599 --> 00:18:00,759
I realized ah yes blue lights I cannot

509
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:04,200
see my veins things see I couldn't shoot

510
00:18:00,759 --> 00:18:07,640
up if I wanted to really frustrating and

511
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:09,640
uh um and then I realized that's a very

512
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:11,320
very European style pragmatic approach

513
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:12,759
to a persistent problem you got all

514
00:18:11,319 --> 00:18:14,678
these junkies around here they're always

515
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:16,200
looking for a private place to shoot up

516
00:18:14,679 --> 00:18:18,000
and you don't want them doing it in your

517
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,679
in your bathroom I was just in Estonia

518
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,919
in a poor part of town in talin where

519
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:23,480
the Russian Community is that's the

520
00:18:20,919 --> 00:18:25,280
underclass in Estonia and I went to the

521
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:27,558
gas station into the toilet blue light

522
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:29,079
same thing they don't want the Russian

523
00:18:27,558 --> 00:18:31,440
drug population shooting up in their

524
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:32,839
bathrooms okay back to Switzerland all

525
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,279
right they can't shoot up there you go

526
00:18:32,839 --> 00:18:36,279
across the street and you see a machine

527
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:38,678
bolted to a metal railing used to sell

528
00:18:36,279 --> 00:18:41,000
cigarettes now the machine sells

529
00:18:38,679 --> 00:18:42,679
government subsidized syringes all right

530
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,759
it cost like a dollar for two syringes

531
00:18:42,679 --> 00:18:46,480
they're just generic syringes

532
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:48,000
distributed by the government that's a

533
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,159
tough sale in the United States but in

534
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,720
Switzerland you're crazy to pass needles

535
00:18:50,159 --> 00:18:52,840
around nobody shares needles you get

536
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,640
them for almost free on the street

537
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:56,158
corner I didn't realize it but now I've

538
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,320
seen that and everywhere you look you

539
00:18:56,159 --> 00:19:00,880
see former uh cigarette dispensers

540
00:18:58,319 --> 00:19:02,960
selling syringes that's the society

541
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:05,320
motivated not by incarcerating people

542
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:08,759
and and sort of moralistic just say no

543
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:11,879
stuff but pragmatic European style harm

544
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:14,359
reduction down the street there's a ugly

545
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:16,400
little gathering of wasted people it's a

546
00:19:14,359 --> 00:19:17,759
cafe fix it's a heroin maintenance

547
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,320
center it looks ugly but it's a

548
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:21,158
beautiful thing these are people in

549
00:19:19,319 --> 00:19:23,759
tough Straits because of heroin

550
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:26,960
addiction and they've got a safe place

551
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:30,558
to get counseling to get uh their their

552
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:32,480
their uh Habit uh topped up and a place

553
00:19:30,558 --> 00:19:34,599
to uh get their lives back on track and

554
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,159
get back in the job Force it's amazing

555
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:37,879
I've taken tourists around Europe for

556
00:19:36,159 --> 00:19:39,679
years and a lot of naive Americans say

557
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:41,120
there's so many drug addicts over here

558
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,960
these Europeans are so liberal and look

559
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:45,519
what happens well the fact is their drug

560
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,720
addicts are alive and not in jail

561
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:48,558
they're out on the streets they're in

562
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,558
Cafe fixes heroin maintenance clinics

563
00:19:48,558 --> 00:19:51,200
getting their needles so they don't have

564
00:19:49,558 --> 00:19:53,359
to swap them on the down the alley and

565
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,360
so on it's quite inspiring when I look

566
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:57,359
at how Europe handles these drug issues

567
00:19:55,359 --> 00:19:59,279
it's not an easy thing drug drug abuse

568
00:19:57,359 --> 00:20:00,558
is a serious problem but we can do

569
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:02,000
better here in the United States and to

570
00:20:00,558 --> 00:20:03,440
me that's very exciting and a very good

571
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,480
starting point is what we're doing right

572
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:09,159
here at Hempfest raising awareness of

573
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:09,159
the fact that marijuana should not be

574
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:16,120
illegal so when we think

575
00:20:14,038 --> 00:20:18,640
about when we think about marijuana

576
00:20:16,119 --> 00:20:19,678
policy in Europe Holland comes to mind

577
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,799
the Netherlands you know they haven't

578
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:25,038
arrested a pot smoker there for 25 years

579
00:20:22,798 --> 00:20:26,400
and um you know I've got a guide book to

580
00:20:25,038 --> 00:20:30,119
Amsterdam so I have to do a lot of

581
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:32,080
research there in the coffee shops and

582
00:20:30,119 --> 00:20:33,439
it is the coolest scene you know I mean

583
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:34,918
you got Travelers in there checking

584
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,038
their email and they're just one big

585
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:38,840
cloud of smoke and uh you got older

586
00:20:37,038 --> 00:20:40,440
people that don't really like the the

587
00:20:38,839 --> 00:20:41,918
youthful kind of vibe so they just come

588
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:43,320
in and get their pot to go they'll Park

589
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:45,600
their bike come in get what they like

590
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:46,879
head out head on out uh you got

591
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:48,599
different sort of personalities of

592
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,520
different coffee shops I've got an older

593
00:20:48,599 --> 00:20:52,119
readership so I get a little more mellow

594
00:20:50,519 --> 00:20:55,000
and laidback kind of places that my

595
00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:56,359
readership would be more comfortable in

596
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,440
and when you go to these coffee shops

597
00:20:56,359 --> 00:21:01,199
you understand the complicated reality

598
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:05,080
of

599
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:07,240
marijuana comce post legalization now in

600
00:21:05,079 --> 00:21:09,319
the Netherlands it's not really legal

601
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:10,880
because you cannot legalize marijuana

602
00:21:09,319 --> 00:21:13,480
without finding yourself in a trade war

603
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,760
with the United States of America I've

604
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,240
Got Friends in Denmark youve probably

605
00:21:14,759 --> 00:21:17,839
heard in Copenhagen of Christiania where

606
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,519
they've got the marijuana and stuff and

607
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:20,720
uh they tell me I'm up there you know

608
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:22,278
and there's lots of marijuana flowing

609
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,600
around everything and they say uh be

610
00:21:22,278 --> 00:21:25,960
careful when you leave with this

611
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:28,038
marijuana because in the in in Denmark

612
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:30,240
we have to arrest a couple of pot

613
00:21:28,038 --> 00:21:32,079
smokers every year in order to maintain

614
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,919
favorable trade status with the United

615
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:35,639
States W see they don't they don't want

616
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:37,559
to arrest him but it's just a pragmatic

617
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:39,440
thing you just don't want to incur the

618
00:21:37,558 --> 00:21:42,440
economic Devastation of going into a

619
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:44,240
econom trade war with the United States

620
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:45,759
so my friends who run coffee shops in

621
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,440
Amsterdam explained to me there's those

622
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:48,839
kind of Dynamics and there's a lot of

623
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,960
pressure from the United States a lot of

624
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:51,959
pressure from right-wing religious

625
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:54,480
groups and so on for them to to roll

626
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:56,038
back the uh uh liberalness of their

627
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,960
coffee shop culture and their coffee

628
00:21:56,038 --> 00:22:00,798
shop industry also there's this concern

629
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,600
you don't want to have drug tourism

630
00:22:00,798 --> 00:22:04,119
people from more regressive countries

631
00:22:02,599 --> 00:22:05,319
take on the train for 2 hours to get to

632
00:22:04,119 --> 00:22:07,439
the Netherlands they buy up all their

633
00:22:05,319 --> 00:22:09,240
pot then they go home well that's not

634
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,080
Germany doesn't like that Germany says

635
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:12,519
marijuana is illegal and people go over

636
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:14,639
to across the border there pick it up

637
00:22:12,519 --> 00:22:16,839
and go home consequently the the coffee

638
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,799
shops with the biggest uh turnover are

639
00:22:16,839 --> 00:22:20,199
the ones right along the border and

640
00:22:18,798 --> 00:22:22,240
those are the ones that are having to

641
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:24,440
have cards where you have to be a local

642
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,359
citizen to go there and and be a

643
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:28,320
customer uh you'll hear that they're

644
00:22:26,359 --> 00:22:30,119
rolling them back in the Netherlands

645
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:31,639
it's it's um you know you always hear

646
00:22:30,119 --> 00:22:34,158
the the news when they roll it back and

647
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:35,559
then the in practice it sort of lives on

648
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:37,520
and I don't know exactly what the the

649
00:22:35,558 --> 00:22:38,720
latest is but it's a you know it's a

650
00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:40,960
constant struggle over there because a

651
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,798
lot of forces that are are sort of uh

652
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:45,440
you know threatened by their Progressive

653
00:22:42,798 --> 00:22:47,960
attitude about this I was talking about

654
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:50,440
the complexity of what happens after you

655
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:51,960
do legalize marijuana Roger Goodman you

656
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:53,519
know him probably he's a local

657
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:56,558
Congressman he's running for congress

658
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:58,639
for jamy spots cool guy by the way very

659
00:22:56,558 --> 00:23:01,678
courageous and he's been speaking out in

660
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:03,080
a very U viable thoughtful easy to

661
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:05,480
embrace from a general public point of

662
00:23:03,079 --> 00:23:07,879
view drug policy points and uh Roger's

663
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:09,960
just a beautiful guy years ago he put on

664
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:12,360
a three-day seminar with the Seattle Bar

665
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:14,519
Association T the whole theme of the

666
00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:16,599
convention was let's assume marijuana is

667
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:18,359
legal now what do we do you know how do

668
00:23:16,599 --> 00:23:20,119
you how do you wholesale it how do you

669
00:23:18,359 --> 00:23:22,199
advertise it how do you regulate it this

670
00:23:20,119 --> 00:23:23,879
is nobody's figured this out the

671
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:26,360
Netherlands have doing this for 25 years

672
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:27,919
they decided to quasi legalize it but

673
00:23:26,359 --> 00:23:30,599
the wholesale end of it is still wink

674
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:31,720
wink nudg nudge all right it's called

675
00:23:30,599 --> 00:23:34,399
the gray

676
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:36,000
area the gray area it's just I was

677
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,400
talking to these guys and uh you know

678
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,599
they've got their laws for instance if

679
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:40,200
you're an American here you're worried

680
00:23:38,599 --> 00:23:41,199
about oh if they legalize marijuana

681
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:43,440
they're going to be having big

682
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,360
Billboards advertising it to my children

683
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,640
right across the street from school

684
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:48,439
these are the issues we should be

685
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,320
dealing with here you know when we think

686
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:52,200
of practicality where are we going to go

687
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:54,119
with this well in the Netherlands they

688
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:56,640
have dealt with this and you cannot

689
00:23:54,119 --> 00:23:58,079
advertise marijuana you cannot you step

690
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,120
into a coffee shop and this is what I do

691
00:23:58,079 --> 00:24:01,519
in my work work I go in as a clueless

692
00:24:00,119 --> 00:24:02,639
tourist and I figure out I'm confused

693
00:24:01,519 --> 00:24:03,798
what do I do and I have to learn and

694
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,759
then I write it down so people with my

695
00:24:03,798 --> 00:24:07,079
guide books can learn from my experience

696
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:08,359
there you go into a coffee shop if

697
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:10,319
you've never been in one before you kind

698
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:12,399
of you're first struck by I want to

699
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:15,158
spend some money but I don't know what

700
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:16,960
to buy I where's the menu because they

701
00:24:15,159 --> 00:24:18,240
can't advertise it it can't come at you

702
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,519
it can't be like on a restaurant where

703
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,759
they post it on the door so the guy says

704
00:24:20,519 --> 00:24:23,480
if you want to know what's for sale you

705
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:26,240
got to push this

706
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:28,599
button so you push this button and and a

707
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,640
thing lights up and you are physically

708
00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:32,158
Illuminating the menu the point is it

709
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,120
seems like legal hair splitting but the

710
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:36,880
point is the information doesn't come to

711
00:24:34,119 --> 00:24:38,759
you the consumer goes to the information

712
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,559
now that seems a little wacky maybe but

713
00:24:38,759 --> 00:24:42,200
that's dealing with a very real and

714
00:24:40,558 --> 00:24:43,918
legitimate concern of the general

715
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:46,880
populace that wouldn't think this is a

716
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:51,000
fun party all right they don't want

717
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:53,640
people promoting pot to their kids and

718
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,839
that's I can live with that you know uh

719
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:58,559
they've got an issue of they don't want

720
00:24:55,839 --> 00:25:00,639
um uh people buying a lot and then going

721
00:24:58,558 --> 00:25:02,519
and and and uh and selling it they

722
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:05,240
wanted pretty much just small time so

723
00:25:02,519 --> 00:25:07,359
they limit you to a couple of just a

724
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:09,599
small amount per day very strict limit

725
00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:11,798
of people uh only over 18 that can go

726
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:14,000
into these coffee shops definitely no

727
00:25:11,798 --> 00:25:16,119
hard drugs the police see it as a

728
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,640
firewall the police like this because

729
00:25:16,119 --> 00:25:19,759
they know where the drug experimenting

730
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:22,559
population goes and the police are

731
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:24,720
concerned about hard drug abuse not soft

732
00:25:22,558 --> 00:25:26,480
drug use and the police even have

733
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,480
bulletin boards in these coffee shops so

734
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:30,319
they can communicate what's dangerous on

735
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:33,079
the streets in the way of chemical drugs

736
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:34,879
see know that's and that's a surprise to

737
00:25:33,079 --> 00:25:37,960
think police would find a coffee shop as

738
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:41,000
a very handy tool for pragmatic harm

739
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:43,519
reduction drug issues you see that's

740
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:46,759
real drug policy rather than this just

741
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:46,759
say no marijuana is going to kill

742
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:55,240
yourself um in in a coffee shop in

743
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:57,199
Amsterdam there is a limit of 500 gram

744
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:58,839
that they can have in their inventory at

745
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,558
any time that's about a pound

746
00:25:58,839 --> 00:26:02,678
they can keep a pound of marijuana in

747
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:04,240
their shop the mayor of Amsterdam last

748
00:26:02,679 --> 00:26:06,840
time I was there was advocating to

749
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:09,120
double that limit to 1 kilo because it

750
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:10,480
would cut in cut down on traffic

751
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:12,158
congestion because there was so many

752
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:14,599
little petty deliveries going around all

753
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:16,480
over town you could you could gross a

754
00:26:14,599 --> 00:26:18,719
ton of marijuana but you can never have

755
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:21,038
more than 500 grams in stock at any one

756
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:23,399
time you see so I I just find all of

757
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:25,839
these little backside issues just so fun

758
00:26:23,398 --> 00:26:27,439
when you think about how Progressive

759
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:29,639
Europeans are and how creative they are

760
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,840
and how unfear ful they are how

761
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:33,120
pragmatic they are you know when I was

762
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:35,558
first going to the Netherlands you were

763
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:38,319
getting a opportunity to buy pot from

764
00:26:35,558 --> 00:26:39,678
Morocco or Pakistan or wherever now it's

765
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:41,278
all grown right there in the Netherlands

766
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:42,679
they've got the technology to grow the

767
00:26:41,278 --> 00:26:44,599
equivalent of Pakistan or whatever you

768
00:26:42,679 --> 00:26:46,240
liked about you know Morocco or

769
00:26:44,599 --> 00:26:47,759
something like that right there and it's

770
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,079
too dangerous and complicated for them

771
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:51,839
to import it they don't need to import

772
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:54,240
it anymore it's locally grown there's

773
00:26:51,839 --> 00:26:56,079
just all of these things just Blossom

774
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,720
when you get down to real pragmatic

775
00:26:56,079 --> 00:27:00,439
issues rather than throwing around

776
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:02,600
bumper stair sckers The Children at Risk

777
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:04,720
thing is a major concern for Europeans

778
00:27:02,599 --> 00:27:06,439
as well as Americans Dutch cops know

779
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,480
that in the United States it's easier

780
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:10,159
for kids to get their hands on marijuana

781
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:12,360
than it is to get their hands on alcohol

782
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:13,799
because as anybody in this game knows

783
00:27:12,359 --> 00:27:15,678
the best way to lose control of

784
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:17,440
something is to make it illegal if you

785
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:19,600
want to make it tough for kids to get

786
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:22,640
you regulate it you just regulate it

787
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:25,000
it's such a clear logical sort of thing

788
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:27,080
that the average fearful voter in the

789
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:30,159
suburbs needs to learn and that's who we

790
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:30,158
need to talk with

791
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:35,038
um when you think about the fear in our

792
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,679
society we can look at Europe and see

793
00:27:35,038 --> 00:27:38,759
how they've handled it 10 years ago in

794
00:27:36,679 --> 00:27:42,159
Portugal they decided to legalize the

795
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:44,440
consumption of all drugs all drugs and I

796
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:47,080
just interviewed the uh their drug Zar

797
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:48,399
who wrote that law for my radio show and

798
00:27:47,079 --> 00:27:50,359
you can see it on my website if you want

799
00:27:48,398 --> 00:27:52,359
to hear it but uh they said after 10

800
00:27:50,359 --> 00:27:53,558
years now they have done a review of the

801
00:27:52,359 --> 00:27:54,879
effectiveness because it was a little

802
00:27:53,558 --> 00:27:56,519
scary you know to legalize the

803
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,880
consumption of all drugs and they've

804
00:27:56,519 --> 00:28:00,000
decided after 10 years even people who

805
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:01,720
were opposed to it that use has not gone

806
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,440
up they took the crime out of the

807
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:05,640
equation and now they can deal with it

808
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:08,759
in a smart pragmatic harm reduction kind

809
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:10,720
of way pretty good what they've done is

810
00:28:08,759 --> 00:28:12,558
they've made marijuana boring it's no

811
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:14,159
longer quite so sexy you know and it's

812
00:28:12,558 --> 00:28:15,278
just there for people who want it it's

813
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:16,278
really quite amazing now a lot of

814
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:18,159
Americans think there's a whole

815
00:28:16,278 --> 00:28:20,000
reservoir of people out there that would

816
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:22,480
just love to ruin their lives by smoking

817
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,919
pot if only it was legal these people

818
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:27,200
are clueless anybody who wants to smoke

819
00:28:24,919 --> 00:28:29,399
pot I think does right and they just

820
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:31,080
have to be criminals to to do it and I'm

821
00:28:29,398 --> 00:28:33,479
convinced if you legalize marijuana

822
00:28:31,079 --> 00:28:35,038
tomorrow in in Washington state you

823
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:37,319
might spike a little bit it would settle

824
00:28:35,038 --> 00:28:39,398
back down to about where it is today and

825
00:28:37,319 --> 00:28:42,359
uh it would just be a nonissue that's

826
00:28:39,398 --> 00:28:42,359
what it is in Europe a

827
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:48,200
nonissue there's no clear rule book

828
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,679
nobody knows exactly how to do it by my

829
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,759
little anecdotal case studies in Europe

830
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:53,559
every country has a different approach

831
00:28:50,759 --> 00:28:55,398
to it in Spain you will see marijuana uh

832
00:28:53,558 --> 00:28:57,558
leavs all over that are just advertising

833
00:28:55,398 --> 00:28:59,119
little shops they just look like little

834
00:28:57,558 --> 00:29:01,918
Little Nick next shops so and there are

835
00:28:59,119 --> 00:29:05,158
little garden shops and these are grow

836
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:07,278
your own shops and in in Spain you can't

837
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:10,559
sell marijuana but you can grow it for

838
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:13,079
your own use so there's no retail sale

839
00:29:10,558 --> 00:29:15,079
of marijuana but there is sale of all

840
00:29:13,079 --> 00:29:17,199
the gear you need to grow it well and

841
00:29:15,079 --> 00:29:18,599
seeds so next time you go to Spain

842
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,399
you'll see that and you'll have to hang

843
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:23,119
around long enough to grow it in order

844
00:29:20,398 --> 00:29:24,678
to take advantage of that okay uh now is

845
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:26,479
that better than the Netherlands or the

846
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:29,159
Portuguese that P well they're all

847
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:31,240
better than what we got aren't they

848
00:29:29,159 --> 00:29:32,320
there's no there's no perfect solution

849
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:35,200
so you're going to hear people

850
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:37,398
complaining about 502 we need to take a

851
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:40,360
step forward we need to take it out of

852
00:29:37,398 --> 00:29:42,839
the the the lock up 800,000 people

853
00:29:40,359 --> 00:29:44,359
arrest 800,000 people a year Zone and

854
00:29:42,839 --> 00:29:46,319
then we can figure out where to go from

855
00:29:44,359 --> 00:29:48,879
there but I really believe even with all

856
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:51,558
of its flaws if 502 passes it becomes

857
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:53,159
less scary for the people that need to

858
00:29:51,558 --> 00:29:55,319
have the fear take it out of this and

859
00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:57,640
from there we can get to a very

860
00:29:55,319 --> 00:30:00,720
reasonable uh Arrangement like they have

861
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:03,720
in Europe at least that's my

862
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:06,558
hope I'll tell you just a few of the

863
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:08,440
ideas that came from my talk with the U

864
00:30:06,558 --> 00:30:10,000
the main uh drug guy in the Seattle

865
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:12,880
police force before he went to be the

866
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,880
police chief of another city um his

867
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:17,440
mission is to protect kids and stop

868
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,799
violence and to enforce existing laws

869
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,558
they don't have strong feelings about

870
00:30:18,798 --> 00:30:22,398
marijuana it's sort of I would imagine

871
00:30:20,558 --> 00:30:23,480
sort of sort of a drag to have to even

872
00:30:22,398 --> 00:30:25,038
worry about this but they have to

873
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:28,159
enforce laws they're worried about

874
00:30:25,038 --> 00:30:30,278
protecting kids and stopping violence uh

875
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:31,600
they don't evaluate the laws for them

876
00:30:30,278 --> 00:30:33,000
they don't differentiate between

877
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:35,278
different kinds of drugs it's just when

878
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,759
they see problems there's drugs there's

879
00:30:35,278 --> 00:30:39,599
hard drugs there's marijuana there's

880
00:30:36,759 --> 00:30:42,720
alcohol it's just problems alcohol or

881
00:30:39,599 --> 00:30:44,798
drugs equals problems uh they're sort of

882
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:47,278
insulted by medical marijuana because of

883
00:30:44,798 --> 00:30:49,038
the Sham aspect of medical marijuana and

884
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:51,119
it is if I was a police officer I Would

885
00:30:49,038 --> 00:30:54,720
S sort of be insulted by it too not to

886
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:56,278
De uh legitimize the whole uh you know

887
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,480
validity of medical marijuana but the

888
00:30:56,278 --> 00:31:00,558
fact is people go in to get their Clinic

889
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,720
card not claiming glaucoma because that

890
00:31:00,558 --> 00:31:03,558
can be checked but they say they got a

891
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:06,079
sore neck and that really can't be

892
00:31:03,558 --> 00:31:07,558
verified um whenever use that word harm

893
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:09,000
reduction that's a catch phas for

894
00:31:07,558 --> 00:31:11,759
legalization I hope that's going to

895
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:14,720
change in the near future

896
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:16,879
um and

897
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:18,159
uh one problem they have with our whole

898
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,679
discussion is that they don't believe in

899
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:21,200
any of our numbers and and it's hard to

900
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:22,880
get straight numbers anywhere if you

901
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,558
look on the internet who made these

902
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,960
numbers up you know the right or the

903
00:31:24,558 --> 00:31:28,079
left it's just a frustrating thing I

904
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:29,720
wish we could get more numbers if if you

905
00:31:28,079 --> 00:31:31,519
want to be credible I think it's

906
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:33,159
important that we acknowledge explicitly

907
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:35,240
that children need to be protected from

908
00:31:33,159 --> 00:31:37,080
marijuana uh we need to acknowledge that

909
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:39,200
it's not healthy it can be abused and it

910
00:31:37,079 --> 00:31:40,439
can be addictive I don't even know if it

911
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,360
can be addictive I guess it can be

912
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:43,798
psychologically addictive I know people

913
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:45,319
that have smoked every day for 20 years

914
00:31:43,798 --> 00:31:47,240
and they just decide to stop and it's no

915
00:31:45,319 --> 00:31:48,960
problem other people they got weaker

916
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:50,519
character I guess and they just become

917
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,399
psychologically addicted or maybe it's

918
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:54,919
physically addicted whatever the case

919
00:31:52,398 --> 00:31:57,158
throw them that bone admit it can be

920
00:31:54,919 --> 00:31:59,038
addictive it's not healthy it's a drug

921
00:31:57,159 --> 00:32:03,480
it can be abuse used I'm not saying it's

922
00:31:59,038 --> 00:32:03,480
healthy I'm saying it should not be a

923
00:32:07,278 --> 00:32:11,960
crime now I've been speaking out on this

924
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:13,919
for a long time and uh I'll tell you

925
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:16,159
we've made a lot of progress if you feel

926
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:18,759
frustrated we've made a lot of progress

927
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:19,679
when I came out I mean I spoke on Jim

928
00:32:18,759 --> 00:32:21,278
French's show I don't know if your

929
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:23,440
oldtime satellites know Jim French he

930
00:32:21,278 --> 00:32:26,000
was a great radio guy back in the 80s

931
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:28,240
and uh' 70s and ' 80s and uh I had to go

932
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,638
as an anonymous responsible you user

933
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:32,880
back then uh but it's so nice to not

934
00:32:30,638 --> 00:32:34,879
have to be so Anonymous but uh 10 years

935
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,960
or so ago when I joined normal and first

936
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:38,639
spoke out I just felt like man I was

937
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:40,000
like some sort of a child molester or

938
00:32:38,638 --> 00:32:41,278
something people push me down in the

939
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,200
chair and there's all these cameras on

940
00:32:41,278 --> 00:32:45,960
me and it was scary now it's not scary

941
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:47,720
at all I was standing on Main stage

942
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:50,240
yesterday with the mayor of Seattle I

943
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:55,200
mean that is really cool every one of

944
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:57,558
our Representatives is hit to this yeah

945
00:32:55,200 --> 00:33:00,960
yeah I mean the people we've got on

946
00:32:57,558 --> 00:33:03,240
board for 502 it's just inconceivable 5

947
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:05,000
years ago like Roger Goodman has learned

948
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:06,440
you cannot assassinate somebody's

949
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,200
character politically now because

950
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:11,480
they're smart on drugs Roger Goodman's

951
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:13,360
opponents try to they spend good money

952
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:15,399
trying to make him seem soft on drugs to

953
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:16,638
his electrc and every time his opponents

954
00:33:15,398 --> 00:33:18,398
try to assassinate his character because

955
00:33:16,638 --> 00:33:20,918
of his stand on marijuana Roger's

956
00:33:18,398 --> 00:33:23,000
numbers Spike upward all right that's a

957
00:33:20,919 --> 00:33:25,399
new age I'll tell you that is a new age

958
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,798
and we got to be smart to capitalize on

959
00:33:25,398 --> 00:33:29,398
that I think it's it's a little

960
00:33:27,798 --> 00:33:31,278
frustrating for me to come to Hempfest

961
00:33:29,398 --> 00:33:33,439
because I get a sense that 90% of the

962
00:33:31,278 --> 00:33:35,759
people here you know they they just they

963
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:38,080
just U are not doing anything to push it

964
00:33:35,759 --> 00:33:40,720
forward in a smart way it's a beautiful

965
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:43,319
Festival Vivian taught me that in a very

966
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:45,278
nice way that this is a a celebration

967
00:33:43,319 --> 00:33:47,798
for a legitimate part of our society to

968
00:33:45,278 --> 00:33:49,558
come out and be who they are in public

969
00:33:47,798 --> 00:33:52,638
and that in itself is really something

970
00:33:49,558 --> 00:33:54,638
to celebrate you know I mean it's not my

971
00:33:52,638 --> 00:33:58,199
crowd but I just love that we can do

972
00:33:54,638 --> 00:34:00,638
this but what I'm concerned about is how

973
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:02,558
these laws are messing up people and we

974
00:34:00,638 --> 00:34:04,398
owe it to if we're good citizens we owe

975
00:34:02,558 --> 00:34:06,839
it to each other to get out there now

976
00:34:04,398 --> 00:34:08,679

988
00:34:28,918 --> 00:34:32,319
teachers can't talk because they're

989
00:34:30,599 --> 00:34:34,800
afraid of losing their job or their

990
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:36,960
option for a raise or something like

991

that but they're with us politicians are

992

995
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,679
are asking me all these straight nervous

996
00:34:44,918 --> 00:34:49,398
questions as soon as the mic's off they

997
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:51,039
say thank you for speaking out you know

998
00:34:49,398 --> 00:34:52,838
we need to speak out we need to speak

999
00:34:51,039 --> 00:34:54,039
out in a way that does not scare people

1000
00:34:52,838 --> 00:34:56,559
some people say well what about your

1001
00:34:54,039 --> 00:34:58,358
business you know I I employ 80 people

1002
00:34:56,559 --> 00:34:59,199
up in Edmonds what's this going to M to

1003
00:34:58,358 --> 00:35:02,319
your

1004
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:03,719
business well frankly I'm not worried

1005
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:05,720
about my business I'm worried about the

1006
00:35:03,719 --> 00:35:08,159
truth I if it hurt my business I'd do

1007
00:35:05,719 --> 00:35:08,159
the same

1008
00:35:11,358 --> 00:35:17,159
thing but the fun news is I think it's

1009
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:19,200
actually pretty good for my

1010
00:35:17,159 --> 00:35:21,399
business I'm the only business in

1011
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:23,239
Seattle that's not selling Doritos or

1012
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:26,119
Rolling Papers that's got a banner up on

1013
00:35:23,239 --> 00:35:27,799
the main stage I think you know and uh

1014
00:35:26,119 --> 00:35:29,280
I'm it's a breakthrough this is a real

1015
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:32,000
Market here if you're just looking for

1016
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:33,200
an advertising in but uh you know I get

1017
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,559
a lot of people that read about what I

1018
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:35,879
think about marijuana they say I know

1019
00:35:34,559 --> 00:35:37,078
what you think about poton we're not

1020
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,559
going to use your guide books anymore

1021
00:35:37,079 --> 00:35:40,599
and we're not going to take any of your

1022
00:35:38,559 --> 00:35:42,039
Europe tours and all I can think is

1023
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:44,640
Europe's going to be more fun without

1024
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:44,639
you

1025
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:53,679
right I really think I really think the

1026
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:56,039
public is aead of the politicians on

1027
00:35:53,679 --> 00:35:57,759
this and the politicians are learning

1028
00:35:56,039 --> 00:35:59,759
and I actually think the politicians are

1029
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:01,359
head of the corporations I think the

1030
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:03,440
corporations are really the scared ones

1031
00:36:01,358 --> 00:36:05,119
and I think the corporations are really

1032
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:07,280
in so many ways they're pissing me off

1033
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:09,000
these days you know uh and uh this is

1034
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,160
one area where they just they act like

1035
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,599
they're moralistic but they're just

1036
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:14,719
reading the tea leaves and what's good

1037
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:16,920
for their business Google um Michael

1038
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:18,879
Phelps is that his name and uh who was

1039
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:21,680
his under Kelloggs or something like

1040
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:24,559
that uh you know he he was caught

1041
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:27,078
smoking marijuana he was a poster boy

1042
00:36:24,559 --> 00:36:28,960
for was it kellogs yes yeah and then so

1043
00:36:27,079 --> 00:36:31,920
Kellog was going to say you know get rid

1044
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:33,519
of them and their uh and their uh all

1045
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:35,760
their stock values died when they got

1046
00:36:33,519 --> 00:36:37,559
rid of Michael phelp so what was it then

1047
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,560
Subway sandwich was also supporting

1048
00:36:37,559 --> 00:36:40,318
Michael Phelps they were going to get

1049
00:36:38,559 --> 00:36:41,599
rid of him too they had a board meeting

1050
00:36:40,318 --> 00:36:43,000
and they looked at what happened to

1051
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:45,200
Kelloggs when they got rid of Michael

1052
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,599
Phelps and then Subway thought uh we

1053
00:36:45,199 --> 00:36:48,000
better keep them on board in fact they

1054
00:36:46,599 --> 00:36:49,680
came out with an advertising campaign

1055
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,159
immediately after that called have a

1056
00:36:49,679 --> 00:36:55,000
Subway sandwich and feel the

1057
00:36:52,159 --> 00:36:57,879
buzz check it out check it out I mean

1058
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:00,760
it's just amazing but it just clarifies

1059
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:02,720
my hunch that they're only moralistic

1060
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:04,920
not because they're moral but because

1061
00:37:02,719 --> 00:37:06,879
they're looking to profit maximize and

1062
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:09,838
we can change that so corporations won't

1063
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:11,880
be so threatened by profit maximization

1064
00:37:09,838 --> 00:37:13,799
I walk a fine line in my work with my

1065
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:15,920
underwriting and all this kind of thing

1066
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:17,800
and I'm very careful not to be Pro drugs

1067
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:19,559
I mean I'm a harm reduction civil

1068
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:21,280
liberties kind of approach to this and I

1069
00:37:19,559 --> 00:37:23,920
think that's our best approach when

1070
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:25,640
we're going out in the public but we've

1071
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:27,838
got to remember our politicians as soon

1072
00:37:25,639 --> 00:37:29,239
as they feel like it's safe they raise

1073
00:37:27,838 --> 00:37:31,799
their voices but right now it's one of

1074
00:37:29,239 --> 00:37:32,799
those third rail issues so um so my

1075
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:35,160
advice to you if you're going to be

1076
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,119
speaking out on this uh please

1077
00:37:35,159 --> 00:37:38,000
understand we got to get out of the

1078
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:40,119
choir I mean I love to talk on Main

1079
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:43,440
stage but I'd much rather talk at a

1080
00:37:40,119 --> 00:37:45,519
rotary club I'd rather talk to 200

1081
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:46,838
rotarians I I mean I'd rather talk to a

1082
00:37:45,519 --> 00:37:48,318
couple thousand people here that's more

1083
00:37:46,838 --> 00:37:50,440
fun but I'm going to get more

1084
00:37:48,318 --> 00:37:53,000
accomplished if I go to a rotary club

1085
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:55,480
you know you can do that you know half

1086
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,800
the people here they put on a suit the

1087
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:59,480
next day and go to work you know you can

1088
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:02,160
take it there we don't need to be in the

1089
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:03,559
closet you can't believe uh the fun I've

1090
00:38:02,159 --> 00:38:05,719
had speaking out on this all over the

1091
00:38:03,559 --> 00:38:08,920
country I got the Lutheran of the Year

1092
00:38:05,719 --> 00:38:11,239
award the vitberg award in Washington DC

1093
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:13,400
and they introduced me as a board member

1094
00:38:11,239 --> 00:38:15,159
of normal that wouldn't happen a long

1095
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:17,960
time ago but now people know in their

1096
00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:20,559
hearts of hearts that you can be smart

1097
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:23,440
on marijuana policy and that means

1098
00:38:20,559 --> 00:38:25,358
taking the crime out of this

1099
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:28,440
thing

1100
00:38:25,358 --> 00:38:30,960
right so I'm going to wrap up here in a

1101
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:32,720
sec don't be scary I'm this is one of my

1102
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:34,480
themes all my friends un normal we try

1103
00:38:32,719 --> 00:38:36,399
not to be scary you know we're out there

1104
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,480
in the public you don't want to be scary

1105
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,880
look at some of your friends they're

1106
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:41,519
just flat out scary not to you and me

1107
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:43,079
but to the person that needs to vote for

1108
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:45,440
this they're scary I'm not saying it's

1109
00:38:43,079 --> 00:38:48,039
right the reality is they're scary so

1110
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:49,440
take the scary out of it uh get involved

1111
00:38:48,039 --> 00:38:51,039
in other things so that when you're

1112
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:53,280
involved in something you're involved in

1113
00:38:51,039 --> 00:38:55,599
something like really nice and

1114
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:57,680
compassionate drug policy it confuses

1115
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:59,119
people you know they want to like like

1116
00:38:57,679 --> 00:39:00,679
you they want to support you they

1117
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:02,519
respect you and then they see what

1118
00:39:00,679 --> 00:39:05,159
you're into here also and they give you

1119
00:39:02,519 --> 00:39:07,559
more time they give you more credibility

1120
00:39:05,159 --> 00:39:10,000
and I find that works really well

1121
00:39:07,559 --> 00:39:12,119
preempt attacks I'm telling you they're

1122
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,358
worried about kids they're worrying

1123
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:17,400
about driving and they're worry about

1124
00:39:14,358 --> 00:39:20,119
hard drugs you can preempt that the only

1125
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:22,000
thing Gateway about marijuana is its

1126
00:39:20,119 --> 00:39:24,318
illegality that's what the Europeans

1127
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,920
have learned I mean as soon as it's

1128
00:39:24,318 --> 00:39:27,639
illegal the only way you can get it I

1129
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:29,318
mean the way most people get it is from

1130
00:39:27,639 --> 00:39:30,440
some Criminal on the street who is

1131
00:39:29,318 --> 00:39:31,480
interested in getting you hooked on

1132
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:33,599
something more addictive and more

1133
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:34,960
profitable we can talk about that and

1134
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:37,200
then just be straight and honest about

1135
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:40,039
you believe the responsible adult use of

1136
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:42,279
marijuana in a recreational way is a

1137
00:39:40,039 --> 00:39:44,199
civil liberty I always like to say I'm a

1138
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:46,359
hardworking tax paying kid- raising

1139
00:39:44,199 --> 00:39:48,159
Church going citizen of this country and

1140
00:39:46,358 --> 00:39:50,519
if I work hard all day long want to go

1141
00:39:48,159 --> 00:39:53,000
home and relax with the joint that is my

1142
00:39:50,519 --> 00:39:53,000
civil

1143
00:39:55,838 --> 00:39:59,920
liberty so

1144
00:39:58,239 --> 00:40:01,679
one of my favorite things I've heard all

1145
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:04,240
in the last couple of years is when our

1146
00:40:01,679 --> 00:40:05,759
uh friend John McKay you know our the

1147
00:40:04,239 --> 00:40:07,799
prosecuting attorney former prosecuting

1148
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:09,440
attorney when he stood on a stage with

1149
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:11,079
us in the ACLU thing here and he said

1150
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:13,800
it's he's a republican I mean he's just

1151
00:40:11,079 --> 00:40:15,039
a hard Law and Order kind of guy he said

1152
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:17,240
this marijuana law that we're living

1153
00:40:15,039 --> 00:40:20,119
with is flat out bad law we got that

1154
00:40:17,239 --> 00:40:21,479
going on our favor it's bad law mayor

1155
00:40:20,119 --> 00:40:22,880
LaGuardia said back in the 30s when

1156
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:24,240
they're dealing with stupid alcohol laws

1157
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:26,599
he said if a society has a law in the

1158
00:40:24,239 --> 00:40:28,159
book that it does not to intend does it

1159
00:40:26,599 --> 00:40:30,599
not to intend tend to enforce

1160
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:33,799
consistently across the board the very

1161
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:36,519
existence of that law erodes respect for

1162
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:38,000
law enforcement in general that's a big

1163
00:40:36,519 --> 00:40:39,519
problem in a society and we got that

1164
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,920
going on right now with this war on

1165
00:40:39,519 --> 00:40:43,358
marijuana I want to remind you once more

1166
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:45,000
we have a window you'll hear other

1167
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:47,279
people talking about it it's an election

1168
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,480
year next year and I understand only

1169
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:51,200
during a presidential election do kids

1170
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:54,719
get out and vote in numbers enough to

1171
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:57,399
make our initiatives viable I I I know

1172
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:59,519
there's FR I'm a I'm a co-sponsor of I

1173
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:01,240
too and I really have a I'm really sad

1174
00:40:59,519 --> 00:41:03,358
that we can't have this grow at home

1175
00:41:01,239 --> 00:41:04,598
provision you know that's just something

1176
00:41:03,358 --> 00:41:06,000
I'm going to live with I know other

1177
00:41:04,599 --> 00:41:07,920
people in the medical community have

1178
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,800
their concerns and the whole driving

1179
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:13,639
thing but these laws evolve and my main

1180
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:15,400
concern is to get over the summit so

1181
00:41:13,639 --> 00:41:17,759
that people out there will see they made

1182
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:20,039
a law that legalized and regulated and

1183
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:22,920
taxed marijuana and you know it's no big

1184
00:41:20,039 --> 00:41:25,119
deal consumption didn't go up crime went

1185
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:27,800
out and now we can get along with

1186
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:30,720
normalizing this thing it's a tough

1187
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:32,760
challenge to get 240,000 signatures if

1188
00:41:30,719 --> 00:41:34,279
you want to do something and you can

1189
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:36,480
just write a huge check and you're rich

1190
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:38,519
do that and they'll hire other people to

1191
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:42,199
get those signatures but I think it is

1192
00:41:38,519 --> 00:41:44,679
really good citizenship and it's good

1193
00:41:42,199 --> 00:41:47,239
hempmy go over to that Booth

1194
00:41:44,679 --> 00:41:50,679
502 check out one of those little

1195
00:41:47,239 --> 00:41:53,479
clipboards go home go to your workplace

1196
00:41:50,679 --> 00:41:55,679
let people you know this is smart law

1197
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:57,358
this is good citizenship this is how

1198
00:41:55,679 --> 00:42:00,519
we're going to end the war on on

1199
00:41:57,358 --> 00:42:01,880
marijuana and then decades from now we

1200
00:42:00,519 --> 00:42:04,280
can tell our

1201
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:07,240
grandchildren that Washington state was

1202
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:09,640
the first state that started the end of

1203
00:42:07,239 --> 00:42:12,279
the prohibition on marijuana that is an

1204
00:42:09,639 --> 00:42:12,279
exciting

1205
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:18,280
opportunity okay so that's just what I

1206
