00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:23,100
last night in a dream

2
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:27,118
I interrogated God

3
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:30,000
why is it the Good Die Young

4
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:33,899
what's the reason to this

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,579
we talked we argued we cried

6
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:37,620
I never did

7
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:42,020
get any answers

8
00:00:37,619 --> 00:00:42,019
but God knows I try

9
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:49,200
the answers already know a question for

10
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:52,859
the question

11
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:56,420
who is it took the creation story

12
00:00:52,859 --> 00:01:00,259
claimed it they took it apart

13
00:00:56,420 --> 00:01:04,379
glorifying obedience and fear

14
00:01:00,259 --> 00:01:07,399
stamping uncertainty into the heart the

15
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:10,799
Rampage through the mind

16
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:14,240
then there's that original sin

17
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:18,060
something about about the devil today

18
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:22,259
Golden Rule do unto others obviously

19
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:26,640
isn't really a rule the lord giveth the

20
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:29,938
lord taketh away the violence

21
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:32,719
for God just sits there with nothing

22
00:01:29,938 --> 00:01:32,719
nothing saying

23
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:55,519
um

24
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:09,719
Reddit set in the beginning what's the

25
00:02:05,938 --> 00:02:13,139
word and the Word was God

26
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:15,259
I've never read it sin in the beginning

27
00:02:13,139 --> 00:02:18,779
was thought

28
00:02:15,259 --> 00:02:23,899
and the thought is to think

29
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:23,900
what that has to do with anything

30
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:30,980
last night in a dream

31
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:33,860
I interrogated God

32
00:02:30,979 --> 00:02:37,139
why isn't the good guy young

33
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:38,340
what's the reason to this

34
00:02:37,139 --> 00:02:41,579
can we talk

35
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:44,878
we argue we cry

36
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:49,280
I never did get any answers

37
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:49,280
God knows I try

38
00:02:56,818 --> 00:02:59,818
oh
