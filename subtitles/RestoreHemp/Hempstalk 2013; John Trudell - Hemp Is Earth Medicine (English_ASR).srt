2
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:06,278
think about hemp hemp Industrial Hemp

3
00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:08,000
see I think that the medical marijuana

4
00:00:06,278 --> 00:00:11,559
movement will get a lot further if they

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,839
will reach out and help explain the

6
00:00:11,558 --> 00:00:17,879
realities of hemp the larger issue of

7
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:19,839
hemp hemp medical marijuana hemp hemp

8
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:22,160
helps everybody hemp helps the earth

9
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:24,320
hemp is Earth medicine and I don't see

10
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,518
enough awareness being given to hemp as

11
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,518
hemp we're too busy using the medical

12
00:00:26,518 --> 00:00:30,118
marijuana for our own enjoyment and to

13
00:00:28,518 --> 00:00:32,278
help heal the pain and these different

14
00:00:30,118 --> 00:00:34,840
things but we're ignoring hemp hemp will

15
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:36,480
help the planet practical reality if

16
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:38,000
we're going to talk about medicine all

17
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:40,199
right we're talking about medical

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,480
marijuana is medicine for the people but

19
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,239
hemp is medicine for the Earth and if we

20
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:46,640
if we forget the Earth then we're only

21
00:00:44,238 --> 00:00:49,238
going halfway there that's right that's

22
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,239
just some

23
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:54,198
attitude Industrial Hemp you build your

24
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:57,280
home out of it you can make a clothes

25
00:00:54,198 --> 00:00:59,640
out of and hemp and hemp the CBDs in

26
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,719
hemp all right are a larger medic they

27
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:04,599
serve a larger medicinal purpose for the

28
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:06,719
human body than even the THC does and

29
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:08,158
people need to kind of look at this

30
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:09,438
because we're talking about diabetes

31
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,359
we're talking about epilepsy we're

32
00:01:09,438 --> 00:01:13,199
talking about cancer It's very effective

33
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:15,000
against breast cancer all right we're

34
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,200
talking about a real deal here but

35
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,280
nobody's paying any attention to it all

36
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,600
the attention is being put to the THC

37
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,799
aspect and I think it's time to

38
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:27,599
recognize the entire

39
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,600
plant for the Earth for us
