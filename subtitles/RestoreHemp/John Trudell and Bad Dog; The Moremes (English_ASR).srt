1
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,200
there's me

2
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:17,519
there's the other me

3
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:18,719
there's another me

4
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:21,439
and then

5
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:24,479
there are the mormys

6
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,600
we all got a domino to play

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,719
so we

8
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:32,320
been trying to work it out

9
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:34,719
we don't know how your life turned

10
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,399
or what all that means

11
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,239
but me and me

12
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,079
we're not going back

13
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:44,280
we already seen

14
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,280
what we couldn't do

15
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:50,640
any skeletons in our closets

16
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:53,119
are our own private stash of bones

17
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:56,799
that scream with no choice

18
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:59,839
there's no scream like the next screen

19
00:00:56,799 --> 00:01:01,919
reducing the present into nothing

20
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,480
while eternity is now

21
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,480
not then

22
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,520
who's divided into what

23
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:11,839
and how many

24
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:13,599
does that mean

25
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,439
love that loves

26
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:17,199
love that fears

27
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:19,438
love that possesses

28
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:22,000
love that needs proof

29
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:23,758
where's the love that accepts

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,319
love that likes

31
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,319
love that cares

32
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,280
there's no forgetting

33
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:36,479
some realities destiny threw at us

34
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:39,118
and fate wasn't much help

35
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:41,519
with this way of loading the load

36
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:43,359
when we didn't have any say

37
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:47,000
and it was up to us

38
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:47,000
to carry us

39
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:02,519
ah

40
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:12,038
wow

41
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:29,360
in the land where the lie is king

42
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:33,680
using fear like glue

43
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:35,760
pretending pretending isn't pretending

44
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,920
at least one of the me's

45
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:41,439
have seen it all

46
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:43,280
each and every one of us want the glory

47
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:46,479
but not one of us

48
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,840
likes the way we fall

49
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:49,759
and strain

50
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,560
is a way of walking

51
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:54,719
when staying isn't an option

52
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,159
because we've been accused of some

53
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:58,639
things we did

54
00:02:56,159 --> 00:03:01,519
and some things we didn't do

55
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:04,518
and we heard i forgive yous

56
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,519
delight

57
00:03:04,878 --> 00:03:08,878
so me and the means

58
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:11,199
are looking for me

59
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:16,759
they will answer to me

60
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:16,759
so far there's no one who will

61
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:22,919
hey

62
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,039
you
