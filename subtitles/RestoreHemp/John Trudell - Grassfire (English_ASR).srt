00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:25,879
Yet between the

6
00:00:22,278 --> 00:00:29,640
blues there are good days and bad

7
00:00:25,879 --> 00:00:33,600
days with everything and nothing to

8
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:37,439
lose. While the setting sun never sits

9
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,439
and the night has no

10
00:00:40,359 --> 00:00:45,439
limits. The void between freedom and

11
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:48,519
free.

12
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:53,000
dealing with the unnatural

13
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:54,760
reality. A need to see, a need to

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,679
be.

15
00:00:54,759 --> 00:01:00,079
Grassfire. My

16
00:00:56,679 --> 00:01:01,320
DNA needs THC.

00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:05,159
Grass

18
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:11,359
fire. In a world that

19
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:11,359
yours, that's the way this fire

20
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:21,158
burns. Like a grass

[Music]

22
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:26,680
fire in the unnatural

23
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:30,400
society. Been trying to

24
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:32,200
maintain while the same appear to be

25
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:37,270
clearly

26
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:40,799
insane with no way to explain.

Outlasting the great

29
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
lie. A sparking spark does my

30
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:51,478
mind.

31
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:57,390
Grassfire pulling the

32
00:01:51,478 --> 00:02:21,520
sky. Breathing in sativa's design.

fire in a world and

00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:33,879
yours. That's the way this fire

[Music]

38
00:02:33,878 --> 00:02:42,079

free. Dealing with the unnatural

42
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:57,800
reality. Need to see. I need to be

43

grassfire. My

44
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:02,280

Dreaming of long times past. All that

47
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:17,360
those times brought. Looking to the

48
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:21,439
heart of tomorrow. Grass fire in a world

49
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,450
that yearns. That's the way this fire

50
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:27,780
burns.

Where

are the fire?
