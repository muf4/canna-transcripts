1
00:00:01,159 --> 00:00:06,719
all right I won't take too much of your

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:09,178
time again my name is Sam Chapman I was

3
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:11,519
raised by like most of the old activists

4
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:16,379
here so that's one of the main reasons

5
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:18,028
I'm here you know who you are we're

6
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:21,539
cracking old jokes for a long time now

7
00:00:18,028 --> 00:00:23,789
so again uh Who am I um my name is Sam

8
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:26,189
I've been involved with drug policy

9
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:29,939
reform but I think I like reconstruction

10
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:33,539
better drug policy reconstruction for

11
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:35,880
almost a decade and the way that I got

12
00:00:33,539 --> 00:00:41,399
involved with drug policy is through my

13
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:42,960
white privilege in high school I was

14
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:44,789
always in a position of leadership I

15
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,859
would sophomore class president senior

16
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:49,140
year I was ASB vice president I ran the

17
00:00:46,859 --> 00:00:52,920
morning and afternoon announcements and

18
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:55,259
I like to party and the administration

19
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:57,448
knew that and my senior year I was

20
00:00:55,259 --> 00:00:59,399
smoking some cannabis I went on a

21
00:00:57,448 --> 00:01:01,858
lunchtime drive with my friends I was

22
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:03,929
followed by the police and when I came

23
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:06,868
back to the school I was pulled aside by

24
00:01:03,929 --> 00:01:09,060
a cop and the school monitor who said

25
00:01:06,868 --> 00:01:11,549
Sam we have reason to believe that you

26
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:14,879
are intoxicated on campus will you

27
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:17,130
submit to drug sobriety tests and I was

28
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:20,118
an idiot I didn't know my rights

29
00:01:17,129 --> 00:01:23,158
I hadn't been introduced to that full

30
00:01:20,118 --> 00:01:25,469
breadth of the ACLU yet so I submitted

31
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:27,270
to it I passed everything but counting

32
00:01:25,469 --> 00:01:28,530
backwards from 60 with my eyes closed

33
00:01:27,269 --> 00:01:31,170
because apparently my eyes dilated

34
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:33,359
counted perfectly anyways long story

35
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:34,950
short they gave me an ultimatum either

36
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:36,450
you get the hell out of this high school

37
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:38,280
right now and you don't walk with your

38
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:41,368
class which I said great get me out of

39
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,960
here I'm going to college anyways or go

40
00:01:41,368 --> 00:01:45,000
to a two-hour drug and alcohol

41
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:48,989
counseling class because we think you

42
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,280
have a problem so I said okay I'll go to

43
00:01:48,989 --> 00:01:52,379
the I'll go to the counseling class so

44
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,239
two hours into this drug and alcohol

45
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:56,429
counseling class admitting to the drugs

46
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:58,109
I had taken the fact that I was going to

47
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:59,610
college that I actually wasn't a

48
00:01:58,109 --> 00:02:01,259
terrible human being because I enjoyed

49
00:01:59,609 --> 00:02:03,868
the smoked cannabis every once in a

50
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:07,649
while the counselor looked up at me and

51
00:02:03,868 --> 00:02:09,659
smiled he said Sam I'm really sorry you

52
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:12,050
had to come here today because there's

53
00:02:09,659 --> 00:02:14,240
nothing wrong with you

54
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:15,890
and at that point I didn't realize it

55
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:17,780
but I went to college I went down to the

56
00:02:15,889 --> 00:02:19,549
University of Oregon and I discovered a

57
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:23,360
group called students for sensible drug

58
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:25,189
policy some of you know for those who

59
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,730
don't students for sensible drug policy

60
00:02:25,189 --> 00:02:31,490
is a global nonprofit organization run

61
00:02:28,729 --> 00:02:35,090
by students who care about reforming our

62
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:37,100
very outdated drug laws they believe

63
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:39,560
that we do they neither condone nor

64
00:02:37,099 --> 00:02:41,659
condemn drug use but they realized that

65
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:43,189
we all each and every one of us has the

66
00:02:41,659 --> 00:02:46,039
ability to put what we want in our

67
00:02:43,189 --> 00:02:48,439
bodies and so long as we are not harming

68
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:52,280
other people we should be allowed to do

69
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:54,289
that through SSDP I met a lot of the

70
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:56,240
activists you see here today I got

71
00:02:54,289 --> 00:02:59,959
involved with measure 74 who remembers

72
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:03,469
measure 74 rest in peace also shout-out

73
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:05,780
to both Jim's I got involved as a

74
00:03:03,469 --> 00:03:08,210
college outreach coordinator with

75
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:10,099
measure 74 from there throughout college

76
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:12,070
I was involved in various drug policy

77
00:03:10,099 --> 00:03:15,560
reform efforts

78
00:03:12,069 --> 00:03:18,799
shortly after I graduated I got involved

79
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:20,060
with legislative lobbying people kept

80
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:24,520
asking me are you gonna go to law school

81
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:27,830
I said well do I have to to write laws

82
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:29,150
and the answer was no you don't have to

83
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:31,580
go to law school to write laws no

84
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:35,000
offense attorneys I'm no attorney trust

85
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:36,350
me but you don't have to go to law

86
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,620
school to write laws you don't have to

87
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:41,629
have a specific education to make change

88
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:44,060
you just have to have a fire and a

89
00:03:41,629 --> 00:03:47,780
passion to do it and when I realized

90
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:51,439
after joining SSDP how lucky I was as a

91
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:53,030
white male who got off and still got to

92
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:54,889
go to college who did not get my

93
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:58,280
financial aid taken away from me because

94
00:03:54,889 --> 00:03:59,989
I smoked cannabis I realized that's what

95
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:02,659
I wanted to do for the rest of my life I

96
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:06,340
wanted to fight for drug policy reform

97
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:09,739
because I got lucky because I was white

98
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:14,449
because I came from a rural town you

99
00:04:09,739 --> 00:04:19,370
know so that's my background and from

100
00:04:14,449 --> 00:04:22,629
there after measure eighty unfortunately

101
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:25,160
had failed it had unlimited possession

102
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:25,790
unlimited growing which was great

103
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,230
47

104
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:29,300
percent of Oregonians voted for that

105
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:31,189
that's how we knew we were gonna get

106
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:33,170
legalized legalization the next round

107
00:04:31,189 --> 00:04:34,790
before that happened I was involved with

108
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:37,430
co-authoring the law that legalized

109
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:42,230
medical marijuana dispensaries from

110
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:45,230
their measure 91 and Anthony Johnson who

111
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:47,960
I do not believe is here yet but the

112
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:51,259
measure 91 crew came through and 56% of

113
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:56,930
Oregonians said yes it's [ __ ] time to

114
00:04:51,259 --> 00:04:58,819
legalize marijuana and we did so what am

115
00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:00,319
i working on now social consumption who

116
00:04:58,819 --> 00:05:05,360
wants to be able to go to a cannabis

117
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:07,129
lounge inside some time right hey so is

118
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,410
there anyone here not from Portland

119
00:05:07,129 --> 00:05:11,120
that's visiting touring around raise

120
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:14,240
your hand give us a cloud yeah

121
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:17,000
visiting are you allowed to smoke in the

122
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,350
place that you're staying right now do

123
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,879
you have any idea where you could

124
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:26,810
legally consume cannabis legally not in

125
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:29,180
public not here right probably not right

126
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:30,970
so that's the big issue that I'm working

127
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:33,560
on that there are plenty of other issues

128
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:36,590
in the industry right now that a lot of

129
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:39,110
more qualified people are working on but

130
00:05:36,589 --> 00:05:42,139
lastly less regular legislative session

131
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:45,379
I drafted an introduced Senate bill 307

132
00:05:42,139 --> 00:05:48,500
which was a very simple bill to legalize

133
00:05:45,379 --> 00:05:50,899
cannabis lounges the idea was that

134
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:52,759
localities could decide to opt in if

135
00:05:50,899 --> 00:05:54,079
they chose to like the city of Portland

136
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:57,050
has expressed they have interests in

137
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:57,589
this but we have to amend indoor Clean

138
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:59,990
Air Act's

139
00:05:57,589 --> 00:06:03,109
because the indoor Clean Air Act says we

140
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:04,670
can't smoke cannabis indoors now the

141
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:08,000
defenders of the indoor Clean Air Act

142
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:09,830
are public health and as often of

143
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,779
reasonable and smart people they are

144
00:06:09,829 --> 00:06:13,039
still are not quite on board with social

145
00:06:11,779 --> 00:06:15,169
consumption so that's what we're working

146
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:17,150
on this legislative session we are going

147
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:19,670
to legalize cannabis lounges we are

148
00:06:17,149 --> 00:06:21,859
going to legalize special events and we

149
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:24,290
are going to allow temporary sales and

150
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:30,639
samples of cannabis at events just like

151
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:33,379
this but wait we can't do it without you

152
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,939
all right if you are a resident here in

153
00:06:33,379 --> 00:06:37,430
Oregon that means that you are

154
00:06:34,939 --> 00:06:39,430
represented by someone in the state

155
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:40,629
legislature whether it be in the house

156
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:43,329
or the Senate you have several

157
00:06:40,629 --> 00:06:44,980
representatives when the time comes and

158
00:06:43,329 --> 00:06:46,359
you'll know when it is because we're

159
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:48,280
gonna be loud and proud about the fact

160
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,990
that we're doing this this session we're

161
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:52,689
gonna need you to contact those

162
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:55,329
representatives and let them know why

163
00:06:52,689 --> 00:06:59,050
it's so important that we have safe

164
00:06:55,329 --> 00:07:03,399
legal access for consuming cannabis here

165
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:06,069
in Oregon one there are plenty of people

166
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:08,500
who don't own their homes right people

167
00:07:06,069 --> 00:07:10,420
who live in section section 8 housing

168
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:12,670
the federal government's not going to

169
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:14,259
let you smoke indoors right this is also

170
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:16,439
it also means that DISA fortunately

171
00:07:14,259 --> 00:07:19,689
affects people who do not have homes

172
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:21,069
right we saw in Seattle and Denver over

173
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:22,990
the last couple of years even though

174
00:07:21,069 --> 00:07:25,420
they legalized cannabis there are still

175
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:28,210
disproportional arrest rates of people

176
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:31,990
of color for citations etc this is not

177
00:07:28,209 --> 00:07:34,149
over yet we are not done and we need

178
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:36,519
your help to get across this finish line

179
00:07:34,149 --> 00:07:38,769
so we can help other states get to where

180
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:42,579
we are now so we can make sure that no

181
00:07:38,769 --> 00:07:45,009
one ever goes to jail again for cannabis

182
00:07:42,579 --> 00:07:48,209
I'm Sam Chapman thanks for coming out

183
00:07:45,009 --> 00:07:48,209
enjoy this great weekend
