1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,440
disease and tonight we're going to talk

2
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:08,638
about a strange disease called gerd

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:11,039
it's a gastroesophageal

4
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:12,879
reflux disease there are a number of

5
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:15,039
people

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,359
that have

7
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:19,919
this problem

8
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:22,640
and it's very distressing because

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,960
when you swallow your food normally you

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,719
feel no

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,439
untoward effects

12
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:32,479
but in people who have gerd they have

13
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:34,799
severe indigestion now indigestion is

14
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:37,599
one thing but severe indigestion

15
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:40,319
secondary to gerd has some ominous

16
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:43,200
implications and bear with me for just a

17
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:46,878
minute i'm going to draw you a quick

18
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,879
picture of the stomach

19
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,640
now

20
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:58,479
when you swallow

21
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:01,840
food comes down the esophagus

22
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:05,118
and it goes through a little valve that

23
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:08,240
is positioned right here

24
00:01:05,118 --> 00:01:09,840
and that valve allows the food to go

25
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:12,719
into the stomach

26
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,880
but it doesn't allow any of the gastric

27
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:17,438
acid that's in the strum stomach that is

28
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:20,079
responsible for breaking down

29
00:01:17,438 --> 00:01:22,399
the material that you've swallowed in

30
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:24,840
other words food comes down

31
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,600
but it doesn't go up in people who have

32
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,520
gastroesophageal reflux disease

33
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:32,399
they have a

34
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:34,959
valve that is non-functional as soon as

35
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,759
food hits the stomach the stomach

36
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:42,319
agitates the food and

37
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:45,759
cells along the lining of the stomach

38
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:49,199
are called parietal cells and they

39
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:50,478
secrete acid that helps break down food

40
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,359
products

41
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:55,200
well what what's above the little

42
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:58,000
valve here it's

43
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,600
our esophagus it's the same tissue as

44
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,399
your skin

45
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:05,280
so if acid from the stomach

46
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:07,359
goes up into the esophagus it burns the

47
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,560
esophagus just like it would be if you

48
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:11,840
poured acid on your skin well that is

49
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,680
the flaw

50
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,520
in

51
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:17,920
gastroesophageal reflux disease there

52
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:20,400
are surgical

53
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:23,280
procedures that are helpful in

54
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:26,239
controlling this but many times the

55
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:30,159
symptoms themselves can be ameliorated

56
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:32,640
with the judicious use of cannabis so

57
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:35,519
if this

58
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:37,039
area here is not functional

59
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,800
and acid gets

60
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:41,519
flushed up into your esophagus you

61
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,719
experience the burning if we can control

62
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,640
that

63
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:46,318
the patient feels a lot better and last

64
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:50,000
but not least

65
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:51,280
the cells that are lining the esophagus

66
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
right here

67
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,878
are skin cells over a long period of

68
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,759
time

69
00:02:54,878 --> 00:02:59,120
acid being flushed up into those skin

70
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:02,639
cell areas

71
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:05,599
and burned can cause a bad problem

72
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:08,079
called cancer of the esophagus it's the

73
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:10,639
so-called barrett's disease of the

74
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,000
esophagus so if we

75
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:13,359
can

76
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,800
discourage

77
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:19,519
the ongoing flush of acid into that area

78
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,120
and discourage the pain we have helped

79
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:24,239
the patient

80
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,239
thank you doctor thank you
