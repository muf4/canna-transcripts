1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,939
we're watching where people understand

2
00:00:02,819 --> 00:00:14,218
that the insane policy of forcing a

3
00:00:10,939 --> 00:00:18,028
state legal marijuana business to be

4
00:00:14,218 --> 00:00:19,890
conducted on an all cash basis actually

5
00:00:18,028 --> 00:00:22,589
I I have thank you for reminding

6
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:25,469
everybody how old I am I've been working

7
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:29,518
on this issue for a long time I have

8
00:00:25,469 --> 00:00:32,368
never met a human being regardless of

9
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:34,019
how they feel about whether marijuana

10
00:00:32,368 --> 00:00:38,210
should be legal or not I've never met

11
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:41,160
one person who feels that there's any

12
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:44,399
rationale to force it to be conducted in

13
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:46,259
all cash basis and we're gaining support

14
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:50,960
we have bipartisan support for

15
00:00:46,259 --> 00:00:57,808
legislation to deal with fixing that

16
00:00:50,960 --> 00:01:00,840
item and 280e I met with several hundred

17
00:00:57,808 --> 00:01:03,839
tax practitioners this morning several

18
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:06,390
of whom were really concerned that again

19
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,728
state legal marijuana businesses cannot

20
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:11,670
fully deduct their business expenses so

21
00:01:08,728 --> 00:01:15,179
they have an effective tax rate that's

22
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:17,460
two three four times what a typical

23
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:19,710
business with that and when I introduced

24
00:01:17,459 --> 00:01:23,609
that legislation at my press conference

25
00:01:19,709 --> 00:01:27,929
was Grover Norquist the Republican you

26
00:01:23,609 --> 00:01:30,299
no no no tax pledge guy who convenes all

27
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:33,180
the conservative activists in Washington

28
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:35,130
DC on a weekly basis and Grover was

29
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:40,770
there sort of indicated this is not

30
00:01:35,129 --> 00:01:45,899
partisan what I think is going to happen

31
00:01:40,769 --> 00:01:48,298
since we have eight states OD it's going

32
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:52,799
to pass in California i was there again

33
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:55,890
last friday going to arizona this week

34
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:58,000
where it's a head medical marijuana will

35
00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:00,750
pass in florida I

36
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,569
with at least seventy percent yes vote

37
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:06,819
and even though it's just mega Florida

38
00:02:04,569 --> 00:02:10,179
will become the second largest legal

39
00:02:06,819 --> 00:02:12,459
marijuana market in America so what you

40
00:02:10,179 --> 00:02:15,250
are seeing is the momentum that is

41
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:17,890
building we've got people who have been

42
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:21,729
supportive of these and there's going to

43
00:02:17,889 --> 00:02:24,579
be a tipping point where over 270

44
00:02:21,729 --> 00:02:27,789
million people will be in states for

45
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:29,920
some form of marijuana business is legal

46
00:02:27,789 --> 00:02:31,979
at the state level so I think the game's

47
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:35,500
going to break we're going to get an

48
00:02:31,979 --> 00:02:40,479
opportunity for the banking to be taken

49
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:43,479
care of Chewie and ultimately I think

50
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:46,899
we're going to also have the damn brake

51
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:49,599
as it relates to research there's been a

52
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:51,219
little loosen with DEA we have

53
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:53,379
bipartisan support for a piece of

54
00:02:51,219 --> 00:02:56,020
legislation that would really unable

55
00:02:53,379 --> 00:02:57,819
marijuana research be conducted with the

56
00:02:56,020 --> 00:03:01,540
same sort of provisions and safeguards

57
00:02:57,819 --> 00:03:04,150
as other controlled substances which now

58
00:03:01,539 --> 00:03:06,939
it's more stringent for marijuana so I

59
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:10,030
think we're watching this year with

60
00:03:06,939 --> 00:03:12,549
those election results in less than

61
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:14,560
three weeks changing the dynamics on the

62
00:03:12,549 --> 00:03:17,439
bath on the ground with the momentum

63
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:20,939
that we've built I think it's all about

64
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:20,939
a turn in the next conference
