6
00:00:10,619 --> 00:00:14,339
tells you that the solution to a

7
00:00:12,718 --> 00:00:15,838
present-day problem is doubling the

8
00:00:14,339 --> 00:00:18,059
prison population over the next 20 years

9
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,500

10
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:21,919
going to discover the thousand points in

11
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,920
light of George

12
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:33,179

13
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:36,480
conservative he's an alien he and Ronald

14
00:00:33,179 --> 00:00:39,058
Reagan both uh they are willing to

15
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:41,039
imprison a whole generation of people to

16
00:00:39,058 --> 00:00:42,419
keep intact the federal chemical and

17
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:44,339
pharmaceutical monopolies in this

18
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:47,579
country which he's well vested in each

19
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:49,079
and I think he's a vampire I don't think

20
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:50,820
he's an American I think he's a vampire

21
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:52,739
willing to suck the life out all us

22
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:54,359
victims in order to remain powerful men

23
00:00:52,738 --> 00:00:55,919
in a powerful position but let me take

24
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:58,019
this opportunity right here wherever

25
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,340
this gets shown in limitation I am

26
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:01,260
pleased and honored to be in the

27
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:03,300
presence of one most brilliant man in

28
00:01:01,259 --> 00:01:05,700
the United States this gentleman next

29
00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:08,700
year author of Emperor wears no clothes

30
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:12,180
and so much more than just an author a

31
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:15,900
researcher and a dedicated and diligent

32
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:18,360
activist and a man who I know for a fact

33
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:20,340
is responsible for tens of thousands of

34
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:22,140
people in this country being able to

35
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:23,700
come out of the closet and stand up out

36
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:26,040
of the darkness and stand up out of

37
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:28,379
Oppression and despair and lives of

38
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,479
quiet desperation and be able to point

39
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:32,519
source of knowledge and the truth and

40
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:34,560
the point of light that this man right

41
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:36,719
here is personally responsible for

42
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,180
putting together I would not be where I

43
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:40,618
am today were it not for Jack hair and I

44
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:42,659
know that a lot of people would not be

45
00:01:40,618 --> 00:01:45,180
Walking Tall with dignity and a sense of

46
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:46,680
Pride and a sense that they do no wrong

47
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:48,360
by communicating with Mother Earth

48
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,280
through the herb and in other Fashions

49
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:52,560
and this man right here is responsible

50
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,879
for as much of it as I know of I'm sure

51
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,439
other people deserve credit to have

52
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:56,819
helped him out but this man right here

53
00:01:55,438 --> 00:01:58,618
is one of the most brilliant people in

54
00:01:56,819 --> 00:02:00,719
the United States today and I hope

55
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:02,459
someday that this country and the people

56
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,259
winning will reward him appropriately if

57
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:06,478
what he's done for freedom and

58
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:08,219
individuality and civil liberties and

59
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:10,560
Mother Earth in this country I want to

60
00:02:08,219 --> 00:02:11,759

61
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,719

62
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:14,719

65
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:34,080
