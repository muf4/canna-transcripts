success you know uh in our clinics

6
00:00:19,278 --> 00:00:24,599
around the country so far we've helped

7
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:27,080
almost a 100,000 people become legal

8
00:00:24,599 --> 00:00:30,000
medical marijuana patients we've done

9
00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:32,118
that in nine states we're looking at

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,079
handing into other states too and you

11
00:00:32,118 --> 00:00:36,399
know medical marijuana is a wonderful

12
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,600
thing especially for the really sick

13
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:41,200
people who desperately need it it

14
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:43,800
definitely leaves so many different

15
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:47,199
conditions and seeing the patients come

16
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:49,439
through our Clinic is is really a a

17
00:00:47,198 --> 00:00:52,238
spiritually gratifying thing they're all

18
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:56,119
so grateful and they help us put this

19
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:58,280
whole festival on and help uh expand the

20
00:00:56,119 --> 00:01:00,479
movement in a lot of different ways but

21
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:02,760
marijuana medical marijuana

22
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:06,079
is not the end and it's not the end of

23
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:08,879
the trail for cannabis and hip we need

24
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:11,359
you know hip produces more fiber more

25
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:13,839
protein and more oil than any other

26
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:17,000
plant on this planet and what we've got

27
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:19,280
to do is legalize that and the worst

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,319
thing about the current situation is

29
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:24,560
thousands of families are broken up

30
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:29,039
parents are thrown in jail kids are put

31
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:32,000
into foster homes all over marijuana

32
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,439
when you you know it it doesn't cause

33
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,359
the Terrible Things That alcohol can

34
00:01:34,438 --> 00:01:39,599
cause when somebody's abusing alcohol I

35
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:41,040
mean a marijuana abuser would be

36
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:44,158
somebody who smokes it all the time and

37
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,719
goes to sleep and he's definitely not uh

38
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,799
harming many people except for himself

39
00:01:46,718 --> 00:01:52,078
and you know we should have the freedom

40
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:54,920
to grow the plant that produces more

41
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:57,798
fiber protein and oil than any other

42
00:01:54,920 --> 00:02:00,359
plant on this planet and solve a lot of

43
00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:02,600
problems so we have a proposal to do

44
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:05,159
that right now we have a couple of

45
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:07,199
proposals that uh we just gathered

46
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:09,599
signatures on we're going to get a

47
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,560
ballot title uh for the Secretary of

48
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:13,439
State the process here in Oregon now is

49
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:15,719
you need to get a th000 signatures to

50
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:18,120
get a ballot title and the ballot title

51
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:19,800
is what actually appears on the ballot

52
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,800
we're going to poll two different

53
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:24,760
versions of our Oregon cannabis Tax Act

54
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,200
and depending on which one gets best in

55
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:29,959
the polls we're going to move forward

56
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:32,639
with a bill for 2010 to completely

57
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:34,959
legalize marijuana and in adult

58
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:37,318
marijuana prohibition allow any

59
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:40,519
individual to grow their own it would

60
00:02:37,318 --> 00:02:42,679
put in the past we had filed a previous

61
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:45,280
bill that would have put marijuana in

62
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:47,560
the same stores as alcohol or liquor in

63
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:50,280
our previous polling we showed that was

64
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:52,640
a real mistake we got to keep marijuana

65
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:55,199
separate from alcohol and so we're

66
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:57,719
putting marijuana in marijuana Only

67
00:02:55,199 --> 00:03:00,238
Stores now so you won't go to the same

68
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:04,239
store to get your alcohol and near

69
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:06,640
marijuana and so uh uh it would also

70
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:09,280
allow people to open like coffee shops

71
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:11,839
or marijuana bars or vapor

72
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:15,080
bars it will just really make our

73
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:17,439
economy boom and open the door for

74
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:20,959
tourism in this state and we need your

75
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:23,120
support to make it happen you know so in

76
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:25,479
the coming months you'll see a new

77
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,640
petition probably around Christmas time

78
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:30,238
and just we urge you to get people to

79
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:32,518
sign that petition and then we're going

80
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,640
to have to win the election but first

81
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:38,239
we're going to poll and see where we

82
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:41,158
stand in terms of the the two different

83
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:44,120
wordings we have anyway we appreciate

84
00:03:41,158 --> 00:03:46,158
all of you folks coming out you know uh

85
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:48,640
if you can support all the vendors they

86
00:03:46,158 --> 00:03:50,039
help us put this event on pick up a

87
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:54,000
little bit of trash we want to leave

88
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:57,158
this park nicer than we initially found

89
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,239
it and register to vote that's one of

90
00:03:57,158 --> 00:04:02,000
the most important things you can do

91
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:04,120
we've got to get rid of The Stereotype

92
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,039
that we're just lazy Stoners and we got

93
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:08,879
to get out there and show that we can

94
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:11,438
take charge of the political process you

95
00:04:08,878 --> 00:04:13,639
know back in the 60s Tim Larry said uh

96
00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:15,199
turn on tune in and drop out well he

97
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:16,639
changed his tune in the latter part of

98
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:19,918
his life and I really liked what he was

99
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:22,400
saying then it was turn on uh tune in

100
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:24,839
and take over and that's what we got to

101
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:26,279
do we got to take over and the only the

102
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:29,319
best way to do that is Through The

103
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:31,758
Ballot Box in this Society currently and

104
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:33,719

105
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:36,800

106
