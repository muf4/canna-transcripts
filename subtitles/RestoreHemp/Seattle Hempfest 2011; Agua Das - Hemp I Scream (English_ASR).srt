we've

20
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:13,960
got we started out with

21
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:17,560
him we picked strategies that would let

22
00:01:13,959 --> 00:01:20,759
us continue to generate Thunder for

23
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:24,079
American agriculture without having to

24
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:25,438
hold our breath waiting for somebody to

25
00:01:24,078 --> 00:01:29,078
change some

26
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:31,158
rules without whining for somebody's

27
00:01:29,078 --> 00:01:34,719
sympathy

28
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:37,479
punch your own ticket pick a product

29
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:42,438
pick the possibility and develop it into

30
00:01:37,478 --> 00:01:45,359
a product food fiber

31
00:01:42,438 --> 00:01:48,199
fuel with food we're making hemp ice

32
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:51,159
cream we started out pressing some of

33
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:54,320
the first hemp seed oil in the United

34
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:54,320
States since

35
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,399
1937 I didn't realize we were going to

36
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:02,959
be Pioneers I thought there were lots of

37
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:06,960
other people already doing

38
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:09,199
this we began making ice cream because

39
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:12,079
somebody said nobody could make ice

40
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:15,639
cream out of him there may be 10,000

41
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:17,840
uses but nobody could do that so I said

42
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:20,079
wait a minute let me think about this

43
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,239
and by New Year's that year I had made

44
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:25,440
my first hemp ice

45
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:29,280
cream oh yes well what we are out to do

46
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:34,560
is we want to grow 500 acres under a

47
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:38,400
center pivot on Navajo or Apache

48
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:41,920
land in order to be ready for the

49
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:46,239
success we need to have five acres

50
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:48,719
growing hemp seed for seed to plant 500

51
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:51,439
Acres assuming a hundredfold increase

52
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:55,439
each year and the year before that we

53
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:58,079
need to have 5 hundreds of an acre which

54
00:02:55,439 --> 00:03:00,759
would be 20t by

55
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:04,719
20t and the year before for that we need

56
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:07,798
to have 100 of that acreage which is 2T

57
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:10,519
X 2T which is one plant so that means

58
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:14,040
we're four years away from being able to

59
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:17,560
grow hemp on a scale that could have a

60
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:17,560
real impact
