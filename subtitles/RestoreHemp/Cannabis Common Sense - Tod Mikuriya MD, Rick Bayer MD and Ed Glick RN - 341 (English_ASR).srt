1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:05,679
we're going to now run a film clip from

2
00:00:03,198 --> 00:00:07,758
Oregon normals medical cannabis award

3
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:09,480
panel I believe this one has some

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:12,638
Physicians we'll discuss it when we come

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,638
back hope you enjoy the

6
00:00:13,558 --> 00:00:21,559
clip the Psychiatry That I Used to Know

7
00:00:17,079 --> 00:00:25,759
does not exist anymore which is talk

8
00:00:21,559 --> 00:00:26,919
therapy um and it's all pill pushing

9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,480
it's

10
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:30,800
all

11
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,039
medication and to the end we really

12
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,920
don't know what is happening and this

13
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:37,200
extends not just to

14
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:41,239
psychotropics but I'm going to read you

15
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:43,879
a short letter to John a kits hamd

16
00:00:41,238 --> 00:00:47,399
director Center for evidence-based

17
00:00:43,878 --> 00:00:49,839
policy Oregon Health and Science

18
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:52,280
University and this is who I suggest if

19
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,359
you want to contact to embarrass a

20
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:56,439
little

21
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:58,079
bit uh on February 25th I happen to view

22
00:00:56,439 --> 00:01:01,320
a panel presentation by your

23
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:03,679
organization on cpan on the cost benefit

24
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:06,719
study of different Pharmaceuticals

25
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:06,719
contracted by

26
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:15,600
AARP the sum total of that that uh panel

27
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:19,200
was they could not develop any cost

28
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:22,280
benefits analyses because in in

29
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,359
analyzing the pharmaceutical literature

30
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:26,560
they discovered it was all promotional

31
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:31,399
rather than objective and

32
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:36,759
scientific so everything masquerading as

33
00:01:31,399 --> 00:01:38,719
science is Not So based upon California

34
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:40,879
clinical experience with a range of

35
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:43,959
chronic conditions our findings

36
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:46,000
indicated significant advantage over

37
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:48,639
other Pharmaceuticals conventionally

38
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
utilized because of improved quality of

39
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:54,718
life and fewer adverse effects

40
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,560
consequently we request the opportunity

41
00:01:54,718 --> 00:02:00,798
to discuss our findings with you

42
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:04,280
attached as a list of conditions

43
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,280
and guess what the response

44
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:13,080
was so I'm glad this is going over cable

45
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:14,800
TV in the Portland area and hopefully uh

46
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:17,560
somebody out there in the viewing

47
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:20,560
audience Can U can give the center a

48
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:23,640
call and ask them to uh include cannabis

49
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:26,319
in their studies and especially about

50
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:29,279
the mental health issue I I would be

51
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:32,079
fascinated to hear the response but I

52
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:35,080
won't hold my breath may I interject

53
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:37,560
just very briefly that obviously there's

54
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:40,800
so much reduction in pharmaceutical use

55
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:44,080
that it's an enormous it's an enormous

56
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:47,280
opening for research which unfortunately

57
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:50,319
Physicians who are who are taking care

58
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,680
of patients in a primary care setting

59
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:56,039
they don't seem to be monitoring the

60
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:58,879
change in prescription drug patterns of

61
00:02:56,039 --> 00:03:01,719
their patients before and after they

62
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:04,399
become members members of the OMMP and

63
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:07,280
it's remarkable because these patients

64
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,760
are reduce they're basically reducing

65
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,360
opiates tremendously and actually

66
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:13,479
there's research I'm sure you guys are

67
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:16,000
all aware of about the synergistic

68
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:17,919
effects of the receptor effects of

69
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,919
opiates and cannabinoids where they

70
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:22,679
basically are hitchhiking with each

71
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:25,878
other and small much smaller doses of

72
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:28,040
both medications create the same benefit

73
00:03:25,878 --> 00:03:30,239
with of course much less side effects

74
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:33,158
these are really remarkable find ings

75
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,920
and and I really regret that there

76
00:03:33,158 --> 00:03:36,919
aren't Physicians who are just

77
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:39,518
monitoring the the reduction in the

78
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:42,359
prescription patterns of their patients

79
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:44,519
if they doubt that cannabis is useful I

80
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:46,760
would encourage them to please do so and

81
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:49,640
just I mean before an after evaluation

82
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:51,399
of their prescriptions will show how

83
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:54,878
much reduction or how much change there

84
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:57,840
is but it's really a lost opportunity

85
00:03:54,878 --> 00:04:00,518
there's a lot of possibilities you know

86
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:03,959
what you just said you you think that's

87
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:07,759
new if you read marijuana medical papers

88
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:09,680
uh in the Ohio State Medical Society

89
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:12,078
meeting on

90
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:15,199
cannabis in

91
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:18,239
1860 a Dr fondiller from

92
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:20,600
Ohio reported that U using an

93
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:24,679
alternative alternating courses of

94
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:28,199
opiates and cannabis for treating caric

95
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:31,519
conditions reduce dependence on

96
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:34,000
opiates 18 19 59 this was

97
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:37,038
written and so you know this is

98
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,478
something new now we're we're talking

99
00:04:37,038 --> 00:04:42,959
about the Takeover by big farm and

100
00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:46,399
ruining policy through their special

101
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:50,159
interest money and furthermore the fact

102
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:53,198
that this whole system this Mo can I use

103
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:57,639
the my paper oh why

104
00:04:53,199 --> 00:05:01,478
not monomolecular Mercantile

105
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:05,560
Madness this is all patent office driven

106
00:05:01,478 --> 00:05:07,519
if you look back to what it was before

107
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:12,519
the single

108
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:15,038
molecule ascended to its uh role in

109
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:18,240
current commercial

110
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:20,318
medicine um you'll see that it it's all

111
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,879
secondary to what can get

112
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:25,800
patented and they claim that the newly

113
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:28,519
patented materials increasingly better

114
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:30,439
blah blah blah but then you see what's

115
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:32,439
happened to the literature

116
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:34,639
it's gotten thoroughly corrupted and

117
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:38,038
perverted so that you don't know what's

118
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:41,439
happening and here we have now a a drug

119
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:44,439
seeking drug hungering public convinced

120
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:46,560
they need all sorts of uh combinations

121
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:48,800
of patentable

122
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:52,439
materials and this and it's really

123
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:54,759
sickening our society and when they

124
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:58,279
started directly advertising to the

125
00:05:54,759 --> 00:06:00,680
public for psychotropics especially ask

126
00:05:58,279 --> 00:06:03,359
your doctor

127
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:07,160
social anxiety

128
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:11,639
disorder um all these these kinds of um

129
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:14,000
influences to influence you and their

130
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:14,000
bottom

131
00:06:14,038 --> 00:06:17,560
line any other

132
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:29,758
questions okay that was uh uh Dr Todd

133
00:06:26,918 --> 00:06:33,639
mcara who wrote medical marijuana paper

134
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:35,720
back in the early 80s and directly to

135
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:38,598
his left that was an RN by the name of

136
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:41,199
Ed Glick to his right was Dr Rick bear

137
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:44,199
the chief petitioner on Oregon's ballot

138
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:45,319
measure 67 the medical marijuana law

139
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:47,759
that passed in

140
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:49,199
1998 then the other fellow off to the

141
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:52,919
side there that wasn't talking much In

142
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:54,680
that clip was Dr Cohen from uh uh Oregon

143
00:06:52,918 --> 00:06:56,639
another physician who helps medical

144
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:59,598
marijuana patients how are you doing Don

145
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:01,800
I'm great Paul it's good to see you Don

146
00:06:59,598 --> 00:07:05,159
dupe here is currently a social worker

147
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:09,759
but he's also a retired Portland Police

148
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:09,759
detective with a what is it a 7
