1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,560

2
00:00:02,359 --> 00:00:06,080
Market you may be familiar with us we

3
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:08,040

when we evaluate a product we we run it

5
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:13,678
through our core values so at this point

6
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:15,359
I think we have eight eight core values

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:19,000

8
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:20,559

17
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:38,640
wealth through profits and growth I'll

18
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,359
go into a little bit more of that and

19
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,558
yes hemp eal hemp can be profitable we

20
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:45,439

Health eating education yes hemp is also

27
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:02,359
healthy like my little organ hemp uh

28
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,760
logo there yeah I did it on PowerPoint

29
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:06,320
this

30
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:07,640
morning why hemp well you you probably

31
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:09,438
all know this preaching to the choir

32
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:11,599
here hemp functions as a nutritional

33
00:01:09,438 --> 00:01:13,959
Powerhouse uh it's a complete protein

34
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:16,599
I've been vegan and vegetarian for parts

35
00:01:13,959 --> 00:01:18,039
of my life I'm not now but when I was

36
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:19,559
hemp was a major source of protein it's

37
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:21,880
a much better source of protein than

38
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:25,240
almond or other nuts uh and it's a lot

39
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:27,158
more digestible and healthy than soy um

40
00:01:25,239 --> 00:01:29,118
also has healthy fats complete profile

41
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:31,240
fatty acids it's got Vitamin E for

42
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:33,840
immunity and plenty of dietary fiber

43
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:35,599
tastes good too and this is also one of

44
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,320
our displays from our last hemp history

45
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:38,239
week promotion featuring products it

46
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:42,599
looks like

47
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:45,560
from Living Harvest and matova harvest

48
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:47,199
lots of hemp leaves so um you've

49
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,879
probably seen stuff like this this is

50
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,439
sort of the market justification there's

51
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:52,280
a lot of stuff you can do with hemp we

52
00:01:50,438 --> 00:01:54,039
you know those tables out there from

53
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:56,399
hemp Industries Association and their

54
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,759
allies kind of show that um so you have

55
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,599
hemp seeds hemp

56
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:02,920
stalks when um I Heard uh Congressman

57
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:05,199
Lum hour mentioned uh about a half a

58
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,920
billion dollars I I think that's uh

59
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,479
radically underestimated just from how

60
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:11,000
much I know we sell and then going out

61
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,800
to our competitors uh seeing you know

62
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,800
two pound bags of hemp seeds at Costco

63
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,080
now um going to farmers markets and

64
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,680
seeing hemp everywhere I I estimate that

65
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:21,239
number is a lot higher um and that does

66
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,680
not even scratch the surface of Market

67
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:24,319
potential when you look at all the

68
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,200
things you could do with it did you know

69
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:30,119
that cars currently have hemp uh parts

70
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:31,518
now a lot of imported cars I didn't

71
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,719
until

72
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,439
recently so hemp at Whole Foods we got

73
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:38,719
about 90 brands that currently use hemp

74
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:40,840
ingredients mostly from uh Canada um

75
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:42,519
about 300 products on on or off we don't

76
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:44,360
really have very good data at Whole Food

77
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:45,879
so it's our estimate as my friend

78
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:49,519
Christina would know uh right now it's

79
00:02:45,878 --> 00:02:52,239
about 25% annual growth um so that's

80
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:54,400
that's a multiple of uh three or four of

81
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,800
our own company growth it's one of our

82
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,680
top growing Trends right now and um it

83
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,680
has been like that for the last 3 to

84
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,239
four years and it's also the core

85
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,280
ingredient in growth brand so you got

86
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,360
all these awesome uh companies that are

87
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:08,400
utilizing hemp a couple more recent

88
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:11,640

00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,200
soybean tofu it's going to be a tofu so

93
00:03:20,598 --> 00:03:24,280
um we've got a lot of products that we

94
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:26,158
can D be derived obviously soap and

95
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:28,680

96
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:30,878
