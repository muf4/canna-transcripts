1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:04,520

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:07,080

board of directors of normal I'm um also

5
00:00:10,839 --> 00:00:16,160
the owner of the World Famous Cannabis

6
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:19,320
Cafe in uh potland

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,000
Oregon it's a pretty amazing place a bit

8
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:24,278
of a change in

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,160
reality and um I'm also the chief

10
00:00:24,278 --> 00:00:29,599
petitioner for sensible Oregon which is

11
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,518
a statutory initiative that we are

12
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:34,878
trying

13
00:00:30,518 --> 00:00:37,159
to right now just Garner a ballot title

14
00:00:34,878 --> 00:00:39,960
it's a real struggle without dollars as

15
00:00:37,159 --> 00:00:42,919
everybody knows is on this panel you

16
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:45,558
know every every little dollar helps and

17
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:48,920
um you know it's getting out there as uh

18
00:00:45,558 --> 00:00:52,799
Rick Steves and Allison said and

19
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:55,160
actually uh going to the constituency to

20
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:57,439
the town hall meetings and presenting

21
00:00:55,159 --> 00:01:00,919
yourself in a different light taking the

22
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:03,358
focus off of your attire and the ring in

23
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:05,840
your nose and all these different things

24
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,719
and just try to look as much like them

25
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:12,478
as possible and then it takes that Fear

26
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:15,319
Factor away from them and you know I was

27
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:18,478
really um questioning

28
00:01:15,319 --> 00:01:21,438
502 and I've listened to Allison and I

29
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:24,359
think that Rick Steves and Allison

30
00:01:21,438 --> 00:01:26,158
really put a dynamic presentation

31
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:28,078
together to see the logic and the

32
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,560
rationale although I'm a medical

33
00:01:28,078 --> 00:01:33,118
marijuana patient and so I'm very

34
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,680
concerned about growing your own I

35
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:38,200
wanted to say that uh right up front on

36
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,600
502 I think it's pretty inspirational

37
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:43,320
myself I was pretty amazed at what they

38
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:45,239
had to say but anyway moving on to a

39
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:47,798
we're doing in organ sensible organ is

40
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:51,239
really exciting it removes all civil and

41
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:53,759
criminal penalties for for the uh

42
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:56,560
cultivation the transportation the use

43
00:01:53,759 --> 00:02:01,159
the possession of marijuana for adults

44
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:03,600
only 21 and older it retains the duii

45
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:05,759
laws and it also retains the orgon

46
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:07,679
medical marijuana act because that's a

47
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,959
huge concern for patients and we

48
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:14,239
certainly don't do not want to uh stress

49
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:16,519
anyone out let's say but you know all

50
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:18,800
the inspirational initiatives that are

51
00:02:16,519 --> 00:02:21,879
going on across the country are quite

52
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:24,560
amazing we actually have um the Oregon

53
00:02:21,878 --> 00:02:26,598
cannabis Tax Act I was involved a couple

54
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,840
of Cycles before with the Oregon

55
00:02:26,598 --> 00:02:32,280
cannabis tax act so I've signed the

56
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:35,280
petition myself I think that any reform

57
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:38,280
is great reform any move forward we have

58
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,598
to um you know it's hard to have um

59
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:44,519
conflicting or a lot of people think of

60
00:02:40,598 --> 00:02:46,719
it as con uh let's say competing

61
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:49,080
initiatives but you know we all have to

62
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:51,759
come to the realization I've learned

63
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:55,040
that um reform is something that we

64
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:58,039
cannot stop and even as our law

65
00:02:55,039 --> 00:03:00,280
enforcement and um the attorney generals

66
00:02:58,039 --> 00:03:03,280
of this country and even um President

67
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:05,039
Obama himself have found it's not a good

68
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,479
idea to go up against us cuz we're a

69
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:10,439
mighty Force out here if people would

70
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:13,280
stand up and vote and and let their

71
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:15,560
voices be heard Anna Diaz here in the

72
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,400
audience is one of uh the ladies that

73
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:22,479
I've T I mean she gets out over a

74
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:24,719
thousand uh Communications with our

75
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:27,158
legislature here at the state at the

76
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:29,598
state level as well as at the federal

77
00:03:27,158 --> 00:03:31,919
level it's amazing what you can do with

78
00:03:29,598 --> 00:03:33,438
your your members money you know they

79
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:35,639
they give you the money to join your

80
00:03:33,438 --> 00:03:38,919
membership and what we do is we turn

81
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:41,679
around and utilize it to inspire them

82
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:44,759
andna write a short brief uh sentence or

83
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,799
two and we go hey everybody signed this

84
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:48,719
today we're going to make a difference

85
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:51,319
if nothing else we are going to teach

86
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:54,120
people how to be proactive as all of you

87
00:03:51,318 --> 00:03:56,958
do I'm sure and so I think that that's

88
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,719
the most inspirational part of normal

89
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,959
the National Organization for the reform

90
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:05,120
of marijuana laws you can never change

91
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:07,199
anything unless you educate the masses

92
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,319
and that's what we do and that's what we

93
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:10,878
have to do even at the Cannabis Cafe

94
00:04:09,318 --> 00:04:13,119
we've had law enforcement walk

95
00:04:10,878 --> 00:04:15,318
downstairs and sit down with my son

96
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,879
Rafael and myself right in our little

97
00:04:15,318 --> 00:04:17,918
living room we have little I don't know

98
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:19,399
how many of you have been to the

99
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:21,959
Cannabis

100
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:24,519
Cafe it's a pretty amazing place when

101
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:28,160
you walk downstairs and you realize that

102
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:30,279
you are in another world it it it is

103
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,199
pretty amazing the big puffs of smoke

104
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:33,879
that Rick talked about in Amsterdam I

105
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:36,199
get to go to Amsterdam this year I'm

106
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:38,959
pretty excited about seeing the huge

107
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:42,439
differences yeah it's pretty exciting

108
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:45,159
but um I think that um we have all have

109
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:46,759
to take from this Hempfest especially

110
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:49,240
this panel all the things that you guys

111
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:51,038
are doing I really like the lake I'm not

112
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:54,199
sure I didn't get your name but the you

113
00:04:51,038 --> 00:04:56,319
talked about the no issue with driving

114
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:58,960
under the inflence yeah the Supreme

115
00:04:56,319 --> 00:05:01,159
Court of Massachusetts rocks yeah and

116
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:03,038
that's pretty amazing you know and I

117
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:05,120
think that when you take all the pieces

118
00:05:03,038 --> 00:05:07,360
of this and then the next cycle we work

119
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,680
on something different in our state we

120
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,479
have OCTA as I said it's tax and

121
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,160
regulate and I think that's a great uh

122
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:16,918
you know I mean anywhere you can get it

123
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:19,280
on the books I think is inspirational we

124
00:05:16,918 --> 00:05:23,079
also have a constitutional amendment

125
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:25,519
brought by uh Omi the Oregon marijuana

126
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:27,879
policy initiative uh Robert wolf and

127
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:30,159
Michael Kleinman are bringing that to us

128
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:31,639
um and I think that's exciting you know

129
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,919
I mean if they can get it past I think

130
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:36,120
it's a high hurdle but if you can do it

131
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:38,240
hey I'm there with you I want to get to

132
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:40,319
regulation I want to get I don't use the

133
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,240
Alward anymore because it totally throws

134
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:44,479
people off when you talk about

135
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,519
legalization at a town hall meeting

136
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:49,038
everybody kind of you know gets a little

137
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:51,879
concerned but when you say regulation I

138
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:53,680
found that that is really an a good word

139
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:55,719
to use because everybody wants

140
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,439
regulation we don't want kids walking

141
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:00,680
around smoking at least I don't I have

142
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:03,680
grandkids you know but I think that we

143
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:05,560
have to really not whirl with each other

144
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,800
and be more united in the sense of you

145
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:09,639
don't have to like them you know because

146
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,400
we don't like each other I mean

147
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:13,680
Republicans and Democrats the

148
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:16,239
independent you know we all we all have

149
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,840
issues with you know with others but

150
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,680
it's it's just part of what we have to

151
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:22,000
do because that's why so many other

152
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,519
groups get forward I mean and you know I

153
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,560
don't happen to be a Christian but they

154
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:28,839
they have masses there's masses of them

155
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,959
if you you know I was proud and lucky

156
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:33,239
and honored enough to march with the

157
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:35,519
people that came out my people for

158
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:38,519
immigration and if you have seen a

159
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:41,318
Mexican March we had the horses out in

160
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:44,359
salum they the law enforcement was out

161
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:47,039
on bikes they were like well you would

162
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:49,840
have thought that Obama was there or

163
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:52,120
even worse you know uh Saddam it was

164
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:53,719
scary I was like whoa I've never seen

165
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,759
anything like this it was because the

166
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:57,479
Mexicans were marching on immigration I

167
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,598
don't know how you feel about that but I

168
00:06:57,478 --> 00:07:01,719
sure would like to get those numbers and

169
00:06:59,598 --> 00:07:04,079
I try to explain to them as I do

170
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:06,080
everywhere I go that this is our war

171
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:09,918
that this is the war against people of

172
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:11,758
color and we need to stand up you know

173
00:07:09,918 --> 00:07:14,399
I'm also one of the co-founders of the

174
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:16,720
normal Women's Alliance this is a huge

175
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:18,918
step ladies if you're out there and

176
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,080
you're just kicking back raising kids I

177
00:07:18,918 --> 00:07:23,120
know it's difficult but try to give some

178
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:24,878
of your volunteer time and if you don't

179
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:28,000
have that chip away a few dollars from

180
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:30,160
your budget so that you can help make

181
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,199
something bigger than ourselves

182
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:36,280
uh as I said anadas right here is this

183
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:38,360
year's winner of the Pauline Savin

184
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:40,719
award I don't know if you know the

185
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:42,680
history of Pauline sa but Pauline sain

186
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,720
was a woman who really LED she

187
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:48,598
spearheaded the end of alcohol of

188
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:51,800
prohibition which is a huge thing and as

189
00:07:48,598 --> 00:07:54,360
we all know prohibition is not patriotic

190
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:56,639
and we need to get that point across

191
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:58,960
that it Wast away at law enforcement

192
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,960
dollars at all of our our country's

193
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:03,120
resources

194
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:05,638
at every level with uh Corrections I'm a

195
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:08,079
retired peace officer and I'll tell you

196
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:10,439
what right now as a speaker for law

197
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:13,158
enforcement against prohibition as I

198
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:15,038
walked the halls of the woman's

199
00:08:13,158 --> 00:08:17,719
Penitentiary as we used to call it back

200
00:08:15,038 --> 00:08:19,399
in the day state prison pretty high

201
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:22,560
security I mean we had some really Heavy

202
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:25,279
Hitters in there but there you could

203
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:28,079
smell marijuana wafting through the

204
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:31,399
Halls as I went to count somebody was

205
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:33,639
smoking a bowl or a joint or something

206
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:37,478
in the state prison and I was kind of

207
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:39,080
pissed cuz I wasn't but my point is you

208
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:42,038
can't even keep it out of a high

209
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:46,680
security prison with constantina wire

210
00:08:42,038 --> 00:08:49,559
you know big old um Mini mini1 14s at

211
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:51,239
the towers give me a break we search

212
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:53,199
people coming in we search people going

213
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:55,080
out it it's going to be there and

214
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,680
they're never going to stop it and

215
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:58,800
that's kind of a point that I don't

216
00:08:56,679 --> 00:09:00,799
think we need to scare them with but I

217
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:03,000
think that we need need to make sure

218
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:06,479
that they understand that point they're

219
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,839
never going to stop us from smoking ever

220
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,879
they're never going to stop us from

221
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:12,480
growing so when I listen to Rick and I

222
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:14,000
listen to Allison they're not going to

223
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:18,399
stop me from growing are they going to

224
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:20,919
stop you no come on but we chip away at

225
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,958
that law and that's what I'm saying I

226
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:25,039
think that every chip is a good one

227
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:27,039
medical marijuana I love it it's a

228
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:28,799
beautiful thing but it's really been

229
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:29,958
hard on the people when I see women come

230
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:31,958
to me

231
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:35,078
and this is a really sore spot with me

232
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:38,199
as a mom and she can't see her children

233
00:09:35,078 --> 00:09:40,319
for 4 months except supervised because

234
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:44,200
she's a medical marijuana patient how

235
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:46,240
good is that law how good is that law

236
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:48,320
and all these laws are beautiful things

237
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,879
but we need to realize that somebody's

238
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,000
going to fall through those cracks the

239
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:54,958
veterans I see who don't want to be on

240
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,000
300 milligrams of morphine that's a true

241
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:59,599
story and they feel their cry they want

242
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,919
to die they want to commit suicide so

243
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,440
it's important that we all be protected

244
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:05,679
because a lot of these people can have

245
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,880
it uh if you're if you're a veteran some

246
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:10,479
of the veteran administration people so

247
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:12,639
it's just this huge thing so each chip I

248
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:15,360
like to just let everybody know it's a

249
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:17,759
really important chip so uh be

250
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,159
thoughtful when you criticize other

251
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:22,120
other initiatives you don't agree with

252
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:26,919
you know because we're sometimes our own

253
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:30,159
worst enemies as Donnie knows yes yes

254
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:32,319
and so I you know I have to say hul is a

255
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:34,360
wonderful person and so are all the

256
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,480
other people that really have thought

257
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:38,039
let's change it you know I people were

258
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,519
not happy with me when I open the count

259
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:42,759
ofis Cafe and some still aren't but you

260
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:44,600
know I don't really care I mean try you

261
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:47,759
the truth hey I'm sorry if you're

262
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:49,320
offended but oh wellow you know a lot of

263
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:51,039
people are offended by the smell of pot

264
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:53,879
that comes out of my house what am I

265
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:56,759
going to do you know most people were

266
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:58,679
just jealous that's what I yeah that's

267
00:10:56,759 --> 00:11:00,600
what I think to tell you the truth but

268
00:10:58,679 --> 00:11:02,838
you know I to have a picture with my

269
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:05,800
Mayor Sam Adams and he's not the most

270
00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:07,720
popular guy in the world I must say but

271
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:10,000
I know he's done some good for the city

272
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:12,200
I think you know you weigh the good and

273
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,078
the bad that's with Obama now I'm not

274
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:17,160
real happy about it but I just chipped

275
00:11:14,078 --> 00:11:19,159
off $50 you know because which my other

276
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:21,799
option I think he might still be

277
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:23,838
workable but you know who knows I don't

278
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:25,240
know it's a it's a scary situation but

279
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:28,120
you have to weigh in balance with your

280
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:30,120
options I'm trying to break in with the

281
