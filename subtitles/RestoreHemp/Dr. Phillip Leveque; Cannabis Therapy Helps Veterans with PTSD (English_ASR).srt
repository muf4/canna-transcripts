1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:06,120
when the Vietnam guys started coming

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:08,960
back uh to the VA and they would send

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:11,440
him to a psychiatrist and the psychiatr

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,120
would say to you well so you've been

5
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:15,399
playing Cowboys and Indians over there

6
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:17,839
someplace and uh now you want some sort

7
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:19,839
of sympathy or something a prescription

8
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:22,640
for Valium for two weeks and you'll be

9
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:23,879
all over it guess what happened it

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,960
didn't work they got them hooked to

11
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:30,320
valum they popped them in the nose for

12
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:32,118
the Valium but at the same time they

13
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,399
they they give the veterans morphine

14
00:00:32,118 --> 00:00:38,679
like drugs anti-depressant type drugs

15
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:41,039
Valium like drugs and and uh it causes

16
00:00:38,679 --> 00:00:44,600
uh the veterans to turn into alcoholics

17
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:47,000
or suicide or some sort of crimes or

18
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:50,239
another and the Veterans Administration

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,679
is literally destroying right now 2.5

20
00:00:50,238 --> 00:00:55,919
million people who who fought in Iraq

21
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:57,799
and Afghanistan 2 and a half million and

22
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,440
and they're just they're wrecking them

23
00:00:57,799 --> 00:01:01,279
absolutely we're talking about medical

24
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:05,478
marijuana

25
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:08,079
and PTSD and and PTSD AB absolutely and

26
00:01:05,478 --> 00:01:10,840
and I estimate that they're probably

27
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:13,798
about 1 million of the veterans of

28
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:17,200
recent Wars who have

29
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:19,759
PTSD uh and at least half of them above

30
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:22,640
a scale of five and those are the ones

31
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:24,759
who are desperately in need of of

32
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,799
marijuana therapy those those are those

33
00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:29,599
are the ones the ones who are less than

34
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:32,280
five can probably get by on something

35
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:34,839
less than marijuana but marijuana is the

36
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:37,680
best drug we have found so far for the

37
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:39,560
treatment of PTSD and within the last

38
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:43,399
month I just wrote a

39
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:47,240
article that that marijuana prevents

40
00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:49,759
PTSD suicides and I got about a thousand

41
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:51,039
comments on from all over the country

42
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:54,879
well you know I was in the military but

43
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:57,719
I didn't see combat but I I uh uh do

44
00:01:54,879 --> 00:02:00,560
know as a marijuana user that uh when I

45
00:01:57,718 --> 00:02:03,078
smoke marijuana I don't have dreams yeah

46
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,280
and when I quit using marijuana after a

47
00:02:03,078 --> 00:02:07,719
couple of days I start to have some very

48
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,640
vivid dreams so

49
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:13,280
obviously marijuana will that that is

50
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:17,000
that is one of the worst symptoms of

51
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:19,239
PTSD and you probably wouldn't imagine

52
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,560
what the second most important symphon

53
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:26,200
is what's that not being able to talk

54
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:28,159
about what was your worst experience

55
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:31,119
uhhuh tell me about your worst

56
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:32,719
experience bam uh uhuh uhhuh so did you

57
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,719
feel that way after World War II I know

58
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:37,519
you went through a lot of very traumatic

59
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:40,598
experiences in fighting your way into

60
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:46,400
Germany meeting up with the Russians

61
00:02:40,598 --> 00:02:47,560
there my first day I was I was u i was

62
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,000
committed to

63
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:52,640
combat I I got uh I got in an artillery

64
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,280
artillery barrage that just blew the

65
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:57,439
hell out of this little town where I was

66
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,199
and the next day they hit me with a with

67
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:02,158
a mortar barrage and when when we

68
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:04,199
crossed the Ry River I got strafed by

69
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:06,639
German planes I got strafed by American

70
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:09,798
planes we lost 150 men in less than an

71
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:12,878
hour out of how many 150 out out of our

72
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:16,000
Battalion and Battalion is what about th

73
00:03:12,878 --> 00:03:19,318
about a, so 150 out of a, that's pretty

74
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,400
heavy attrition rate 15% in an hour we

75
00:03:19,318 --> 00:03:23,479
had

76
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:28,120
the my Battalion my division had the

77
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:28,119
worst casualties crossing the Ryan River
