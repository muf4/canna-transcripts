1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,520
thanks you guys I am so happy to be here

2
00:00:03,029 --> 00:00:09,029
I can't even tell you as I say every

3
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:11,039
year this is my activist anniversary so

4
00:00:09,029 --> 00:00:16,528
thanks for coming to my party y'all I'm

5
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:17,910
so happy you're here you know I was one

6
00:00:16,528 --> 00:00:21,240
of the founders of Oregon Normal and

7
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:22,980
then in 2013 I was approached by a man

8
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:25,919
named Mickey Martin who was a an

9
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:28,079
activist in California and if you know

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,050
him you either loved him or you hated

11
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:34,109
him because he was a man of very strong

12
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:36,480
opinions but he also became my mentor

13
00:00:34,109 --> 00:00:38,340
and my friend and my brother through our

14
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:40,468
work together with parents for pot and

15
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:42,600
today since we're memorializing the

16
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:44,700
people that we've lost I'd like to add

17
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,730
him to the list because we lost him last

18
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:50,600
June sadly he was the driving force

19
00:00:47,729 --> 00:00:56,069
behind parents for pot and he and now

20
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:59,039
that he's gone I feel compelled to take

21
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:01,549
up the torch that he left and carry on

22
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,120
the work for parents for pot one of us

23
00:01:01,549 --> 00:01:05,128
thanks baby

24
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:07,739
one of the things that he used to say

25
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:08,368
was that he likes weed and he's a good

26
00:01:07,739 --> 00:01:10,920
person

27
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:13,500
I think that's true for everyone here

28
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,780
even if you don't consume cannabis you

29
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:18,359
can still like weed and you're still can

30
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:21,450
be a good person the goal of parents for

31
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:25,289
pot is to remove the stigma of cannabis

32
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:27,930
use for parents and families so that we

33
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:30,360
can participate in the world like

34
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:32,790
everyone else I hear stories from people

35
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:35,129
every day who are good people who are

36
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:38,340
taxpaying people who have lost their

37
00:01:35,129 --> 00:01:40,379
bank accounts because the bank found out

38
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,990
that their money came from cannabis and

39
00:01:40,379 --> 00:01:46,140
they closed their personal bank accounts

40
00:01:42,989 --> 00:01:48,449
I hear from people who are working hard

41
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:51,239
making a lot of money trying to buy

42
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:53,549
houses who can't get a loan because

43
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:55,140
every time they get to that step where

44
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:57,840
they find out that they work in the

45
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:59,968
cannabis industry they're denied these

46
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:03,450
well this poor family has an empty house

47
00:01:59,968 --> 00:02:06,390
brand new built waiting for them they're

48
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:09,149
good people who like weed I hear from

49
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:12,090
parents whose children are being taken

50
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:13,409
away from them even now even in Oregon

51
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:16,710
Russ Belleville just

52
00:02:13,409 --> 00:02:19,229
me a story today that warmed my heart

53
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:22,200
because the woman won her children back

54
00:02:19,229 --> 00:02:27,479
because why she was a good person who

55
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:29,789
liked weed so we we still have a lot of

56
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:32,219
work to do there is so much stigma

57
00:02:29,789 --> 00:02:34,169
around cannabis use that when I first

58
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:37,349
started speaking at these events back in

59
00:02:34,169 --> 00:02:39,959
2001 it was revolutionary for me to call

60
00:02:37,349 --> 00:02:42,989
myself a proud stoner I think that all

61
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:46,860
of us here can honestly openly say that

62
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:49,530
we are all proud stoners we function in

63
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:52,980
this world we pay our taxes we do what

64
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:56,039
we need to do and we should just be left

65
00:02:52,979 --> 00:02:58,919
alone for that we all know that weed is

66
00:02:56,039 --> 00:03:00,689
much less harmful than any other legal

67
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:05,329
substance that adults are allowed to

68
00:03:00,689 --> 00:03:08,250
consume probably safer than even sex so

69
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:08,850
what is the big deal and yet we're

70
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:10,740
treated

71
00:03:08,849 --> 00:03:15,629
we're marginalized we're treated like

72
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:19,439
criminals parents are being parents are

73
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:22,469
being sent to child protective services

74
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:25,139
by their own children's doctors for

75
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:27,240
recommending cannabis instead of the

76
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:30,299
poison that the pharmaceutical company

77
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:32,459
wants to feed them what is wrong with

78
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:35,370
this people are going to cannabis as the

79
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:36,990
last resort for their health issues when

80
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:39,330
if they had used it as their first

81
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:42,409
resort their health would probably be

82
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:47,180
much better why is that because we are

83
00:03:42,409 --> 00:03:50,759
stigmatized because we are marginalized

84
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:53,459
for our choice of recreation and our

85
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:55,979
choice of medicine parents for pot works

86
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:58,620
hard to bring this to an end and we need

87
00:03:55,979 --> 00:04:02,159
your help to do it too the what all you

88
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:05,520
have to do is do like I do stand up be

89
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:07,650
proud I work every day I go to work

90
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:09,900
every day we doesn't keep me stuck to my

91
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:12,700
couch I'm totally functioning I'm high

92
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:15,849

93
00:04:12,699 --> 00:04:18,849
I say this and I want you to say it with

94
00:04:15,849 --> 00:04:20,560
me I like weed and I'm a good person I

95
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:23,200
want everyone here to say it so that

00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:27,360

97
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:30,969

parents for pot join me and let's end

105
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:56,799
the stigma of cannabis use for adults

106
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:59,560
because cannabis may be legal but we are

107
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,870
not free thank you
