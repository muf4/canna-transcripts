1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,209
yeah you feelin good well I'm really

2
00:00:03,569 --> 00:00:07,919
excited to be here as super glad to be

3
00:00:06,209 --> 00:00:10,620
back here again for those of you who

4
00:00:07,918 --> 00:00:12,419
don't know about the ACLU we are one of

5
00:00:10,619 --> 00:00:15,088
the oldest civil liberties organizations

6
00:00:12,419 --> 00:00:16,948
in the country National Organization is

7
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:19,439
almost a hundred years old now and we've

8
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:23,460
had an organization here in Portland and

9
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:26,429
in Oregon for six over 60 years and we

10
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:28,769
have been working on drug war issues and

11
00:00:26,429 --> 00:00:31,759
on marijuana issues for a very very long

12
00:00:28,768 --> 00:00:34,769
time back when we were fighting for a

13
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:37,049
decriminalization of small amounts of

14
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:38,820
marijuana a long long time ago fighting

15
00:00:37,049 --> 00:00:41,218
for medical marijuana and then fighting

16
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:45,030
for fighting for recreational marijuana

17
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:47,250
and and really the fight continues so

18
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:49,140
I'm the policy director I work on

19
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:52,710
legislation at this at the state

20
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:55,020
legislature I also advocate in in the

21
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:58,259
city the city of Portland and cities and

22
00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:00,300
counties around the around the state so

23
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:03,030
you know at the ACLU we really believe

24
00:01:00,299 --> 00:01:04,920
that the drug war and and and the war

25
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:06,840
against marijuana that has been going on

26
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,460
for a very very long time it's one of

27
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:11,670
the most important civil liberties

28
00:01:08,459 --> 00:01:16,109
issues of our time really one of the

29
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:18,180
most important issues it's important

30
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:21,420
because it has to do with people's

31
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:23,310
access to medicine which is incredibly

32
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:25,109
important to all of us and it also has

33
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:27,030
to do with our our personal autonomy

34
00:01:25,109 --> 00:01:29,280
right the decisions that we make about

35
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:32,189
our own bodies and what we do with our

36
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,049
own bodies and how how we do things with

37
00:01:32,188 --> 00:01:36,779
our bodies that doesn't hurt anybody

38
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:39,329
else right we're not hurting anybody

39
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:42,659
else will we make decisions about using

40
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:44,429
or not using marijuana and so it's it's

41
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:47,479
a really crucial issue that we'd be able

42
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:50,399
to have that freedom right not only that

43
00:01:47,478 --> 00:01:52,349
the drug war intersects with so many

44
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,719
other civil liberties issues that are

45
00:01:52,349 --> 00:01:57,000
important to us right there's there's a

46
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:59,759
huge intersection with racial justice

47
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,530
when we look at the way the drug war has

48
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,810
really disproportionately impact

49
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:06,210
communities of color in this country and

50
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:07,859
also frankly all around the world right

51
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:09,689
and then there's such a huge

52
00:02:07,859 --> 00:02:11,128
intersection obviously with the criminal

53
00:02:09,689 --> 00:02:13,340
justice system and with the fact that

54
00:02:11,128 --> 00:02:15,799
we've been locking people up and

55
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:17,629
and you know for manufacturing marijuana

56
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:22,069
for selling marijuana for using

57
00:02:17,629 --> 00:02:24,019
marijuana for far far too long so you

58
00:02:22,068 --> 00:02:25,879
know we have come really far and I'd

59
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:27,830
like us just to like take a moment to

60
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:30,229
actually like acknowledge that at least

61
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:32,989
here in Oregon we have come really

62
00:02:30,229 --> 00:02:35,149
really far and we should like seriously

63
00:02:32,989 --> 00:02:38,420
power ourselves on the back all of us

64
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:40,219
for that fight right it's absolutely

65
00:02:38,419 --> 00:02:42,679
amazing but we also need to acknowledge

66
00:02:40,219 --> 00:02:46,340
and recognize that we have so much

67
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:48,920
farther to go right here in Oregon you

68
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:52,879
know we at the ACLU we dream of an

69
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:55,639
Oregon where insurance pays for medical

70
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:57,469
marijuana right where people have access

71
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:59,449
to marijuana and not being able to

72
00:02:57,469 --> 00:03:01,009
afford it is not gonna stop them from

73
00:02:59,449 --> 00:03:03,409
being able to access their medicine

74
00:03:01,009 --> 00:03:06,019
right we dream of a world where medical

75
00:03:03,409 --> 00:03:08,689
patients and recreational users don't

76
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:10,819
face discrimination in the workplace and

77
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:13,489
in housing and where we actually have

78
00:03:10,818 --> 00:03:15,289
protections against that kinds of just

79
00:03:13,489 --> 00:03:17,239
kind of discrimination right because

80
00:03:15,289 --> 00:03:18,469
what people are doing for medicine and

81
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:20,959
what people are doing in their free time

82
00:03:18,469 --> 00:03:24,109
shouldn't have anything to do with what

83
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:26,420
they're doing on the job right and where

84
00:03:24,109 --> 00:03:27,920
they get to live so those are huge

85
00:03:26,419 --> 00:03:29,539
issues that we need to fight here in

86
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:32,509
Oregon but we also have a responsibility

87
00:03:29,539 --> 00:03:34,818
to fight for legalization in every

88
00:03:32,509 --> 00:03:37,159
single state in this country and not

89
00:03:34,818 --> 00:03:39,649
only that we need legalization

90
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:42,139
everywhere in the world and we really

91
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:43,719
need to take take take responsibility

92
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:46,659
for the fact that the United States

93
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:50,030
really has they took the drug war

94
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:52,579
international right and we we brought

95
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:55,310
that mindset to places where that

96
00:03:52,579 --> 00:03:57,260
mindset did not even exist right and so

97
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:59,000
we have a responsibility not only to

98
00:03:57,259 --> 00:04:01,939
change things here but to change things

99
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,680
in the rest of the world so I'm just

100
00:04:01,939 --> 00:04:05,599
really you know I'm honored to be here

101
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,329
I'm honored to be part of this amazing

102
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:10,219
community of people who advocate for for

103
00:04:08,329 --> 00:04:13,010
our rights and advocate against can a

104
00:04:10,219 --> 00:04:14,689
biga tree we do have a lot of work to do

105
00:04:13,009 --> 00:04:17,120
and I'm just here to tell you the ACLU
