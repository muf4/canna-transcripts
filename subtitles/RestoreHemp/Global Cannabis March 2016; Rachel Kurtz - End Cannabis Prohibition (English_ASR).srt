1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,339
thank you so much to Scott herb Thrasher

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:07,980
he's put on a lot of work here this is

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:11,010
all his work today and with some help

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:14,400
from volunteers and also he is the

5
00:00:11,009 --> 00:00:16,559
director of Portland normal which is the

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,320
organization in this state that is for

7
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:22,140
consumers and that's a voice that often

8
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:26,329
gets lost especially these days with

9
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:29,070
so-called legalization in this state I

10
00:00:26,329 --> 00:00:30,659
personally have didn't have much of a

11
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:33,049
speech plan because I spent the last

12
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:35,429
three months my life wasted on a

13
00:00:33,049 --> 00:00:37,619
swindler who is going to invest in me

14
00:00:35,429 --> 00:00:40,409
but that's what we have now these days

15
00:00:37,619 --> 00:00:42,959
is these sharks circling these people

16
00:00:40,409 --> 00:00:45,029
who haven't been involved in cannabis at

17
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,640
all and don't really care about the plan

18
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:49,460
are now circling to try to make money

19
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,870
and so I just want everybody to be

20
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:54,628
conscious of that and aware of it and

21
00:00:51,869 --> 00:00:56,939
and aware of who you support when you do

22
00:00:54,628 --> 00:01:00,149
buy products and that it's people who

23
00:00:56,939 --> 00:01:01,799
really do care about this plant I as he

24
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:03,228
said I've been involved in Seattle I

25
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:05,489
actually moved here year and a half ago

26
00:01:03,228 --> 00:01:07,228
because I fell in love with a grower

27
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:11,090
down here but I've been a cannabis

28
00:01:07,228 --> 00:01:15,118
activist in washington state since 1995

29
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:17,310
and you know what's happening up there

30
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:19,890
is not pretty and it's you know

31
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:22,109
so-called legalization but you know who

32
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:23,849
thinks this is legal do we think this is

33
00:01:22,109 --> 00:01:25,759
legal because the feds certainly don't

34
00:01:23,849 --> 00:01:29,839
the feds think you're all criminals

35
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:32,400
still and they the reason that our

36
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,710
regulations are so ugly is because of

37
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,570
the feds up in Washington it's like they

38
00:01:34,709 --> 00:01:38,328
treat it like plutonium or something

39
00:01:36,569 --> 00:01:41,819
when it's a plant that helps people

40
00:01:38,328 --> 00:01:45,478
actually had a friend contact me this

41
00:01:41,819 --> 00:01:48,419
morning who said that he had a friend up

42
00:01:45,478 --> 00:01:51,469
in tacoma who had a five-year-old who

43
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:54,269
has a serious illness and really needs

44
00:01:51,469 --> 00:01:56,879
cannabis and he's actually calling visit

45
00:01:54,269 --> 00:01:58,468
this is an estate that supposedly legal

46
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:01,289
and you can go to the store and buy it

47
00:01:58,468 --> 00:02:03,688
and he can't fight they can't find help

48
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:06,030
for their five-year-old and that's

49
00:02:03,688 --> 00:02:08,250
what's sad is that it used to be easier

50
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:10,679
to help children but with all the

51
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:12,239
regulations that are getting piled on

52
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:12,960
people and the way they're just getting

53
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,740
rid of men

54
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:18,810
a call the troop growers aren't there

55
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:21,300
anymore and you can't find these

56
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:24,560
products that actually help people so

57
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:27,660
down here I actually had the fortunate

58
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:30,240
the fortune to spend some time down in a

59
00:02:27,659 --> 00:02:33,389
Applegate Valley last few days with some

60
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:36,120
just incredible growers who put a lot of

61
00:02:33,389 --> 00:02:38,609
time and energy into making extracts

62
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:41,700
that they can give to people with with

63
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:44,520
cancer and children and they told me a

64
00:02:41,699 --> 00:02:48,539
story about a friend whose dad had they

65
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:50,700
been getting oil to for free and the

66
00:02:48,539 --> 00:02:53,039
doctor said I don't know what you're

67
00:02:50,699 --> 00:02:55,889
doing but keep doing it so we know that

68
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:58,169
it works and these are people that you

69
00:02:55,889 --> 00:03:01,379
know the state and the feds would love

70
00:02:58,169 --> 00:03:04,619
to run out of the business so that they

71
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:07,500
can put more and more regulations on

72
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:11,759
this and track where every single seed

73
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:14,729
and plant goes because God forbid that

74
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:17,669
it get out to people that we share it so

75
00:03:14,729 --> 00:03:19,979
it's so crucial that we keep home grows

76
00:03:17,669 --> 00:03:22,439
and then we keep medical gardens because

77
00:03:19,979 --> 00:03:25,139
these are people who are trying to get

78
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:27,090
genetics out to people the genetics that

79
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:30,809
help people instead of just trying to

80
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:33,090
get the highest th e and and there are

81
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:35,009
the people that can be shut out because

82
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:37,740
they don't have the money that it takes

83
00:03:35,009 --> 00:03:40,109
to follow these regulations that they're

84
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:43,650
really expensive everybody wants cheap

85
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:45,000
pot but it costs a lot of money the when

86
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:47,159
you're when you've got so many

87
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,620
regulations on you have to keep to buy

88
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:52,650
this expensive software put tags on

89
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:55,490
every plant pay all these ridiculous

90
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:58,289
taxes 280 doesn't allow businesses to

91
00:03:55,490 --> 00:04:01,800
deduct expenses at the federal level the

92
00:03:58,289 --> 00:04:04,109
federal the feds are taking half of the

93
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:06,360
profits from people so it's really

94
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:10,080
expensive to get in so this fight is not

95
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:12,090
over while you're here walk around to

96
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,160
all the booths and sign up for things

97
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:16,798
it's okay to sign up for all of them

98
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:19,019
there's a lot of groups out there but

99
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:20,519
there's a lot of issues there's going to

100
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:22,709
be a lot of groups you know people talk

101
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:25,319
about we all need to get together and 12

102
00:04:22,709 --> 00:04:26,519
under one umbrella and that's fine if

103
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:29,038
you have some common al

104
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:31,680
but there's there's so many issues out

105
00:04:29,038 --> 00:04:34,019
there I wrote I was thinking about all

106
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,300
these there's let's see there smoking

107
00:04:34,019 --> 00:04:38,810
lounges there's County bands there's

108
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:43,560
280e there's edible limits

109
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:45,839
over-regulation pesticides patients

110
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:49,889
small growers are so many issues to

111
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:51,658
focus on and all the different

112
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:53,610
organizations kind of have a different

113
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:55,259
niche so be part of it signed up for all

114
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:58,710
the lists and if there's one that really

115
00:04:55,259 --> 00:05:00,930
speaks to you get active get involved

116
00:04:58,709 --> 00:05:03,209
because this fight isn't over and and we

117
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:05,220
get complacent when we think it's legal

118
00:05:03,209 --> 00:05:07,829
but it's not there's still people

119
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:10,080
serving life in prison for pot and even

120
00:05:07,829 --> 00:05:12,719
when they're it is legal and it seems

121
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:15,149
like it's a good thing oh we can all

122
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,520
come out here and smoke pot together but

123
00:05:15,149 --> 00:05:21,089
behind the scenes with the industry

124
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:23,549
there's regulations going on that that

125
00:05:21,089 --> 00:05:25,679
don't help they actually hurt you know

126
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:27,960
all these cups that we enjoy going to

127
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,848
this is just one example and actually

128
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:31,529
organs doing it much better the jobs in

129
00:05:29,848 --> 00:05:36,149
Washington I'll tell you that much but

130
00:05:31,529 --> 00:05:37,709
one of the regulations in Oregon is that

131
00:05:36,149 --> 00:05:40,258
you know the people who get a

132
00:05:37,709 --> 00:05:42,538
recreational license can only give

133
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:44,340
samples to other people with

134
00:05:42,538 --> 00:05:47,218
recreational license in order to try to

135
00:05:44,339 --> 00:05:49,679
sell it that means that when a cup comes

136
00:05:47,218 --> 00:05:53,129
along next year a recreational grower

137
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,810
can't give a sample to the cup that it's

138
00:05:53,129 --> 00:05:57,209
not legal they'd have to actually go to

139
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:59,908
the store and buy it to submit it to a

140
00:05:57,209 --> 00:06:01,769
cup and I brought that up to the LCC and

141
00:05:59,908 --> 00:06:03,718
they they claim that that's not what

142
00:06:01,769 --> 00:06:05,758
they intend to do so maybe we'll see

143
00:06:03,718 --> 00:06:09,060
some changes but it's little things like

144
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:12,419
that that they're just so concerned with

145
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:17,339
tracking every bit because it might hit

146
00:06:12,418 --> 00:06:20,250
leaked out god forbid somewhere and they

147
00:06:17,339 --> 00:06:21,869
don't think about like the actual effect

148
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:24,120
on the industry the people who have been

149
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:26,639
in this so long and know what's best for

150
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:28,199
the plant and for patients and they're

151
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,759
worried about it might go to another

152
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:31,288
state well you know what if it's going

153
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:34,288
to other states at least they're not

154
00:06:31,288 --> 00:06:37,408
getting in Mexico right so there isn't

155
00:06:34,288 --> 00:06:39,149
that horrible you know let hopefully we

156
00:06:37,408 --> 00:06:39,959
have to continue the fight to legalize

157
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:42,269
it federally that

158
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:46,649
just the number one thing right now I

159
00:06:42,269 --> 00:06:48,930
think and so like I said go around sign

160
00:06:46,649 --> 00:06:51,418
up thank you so much for coming remember

161
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:53,699
seattle hempfest third weekend of august

162
00:06:51,418 --> 00:06:55,529
largest cannabis protest evil in the

163
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:58,580
world and we'd love to see you all there

164
00:06:55,529 --> 00:06:58,579
thanks again Scott
