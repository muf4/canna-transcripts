25
00:01:08,299 --> 00:01:14,700
caregivers recreational growers

26
00:01:12,379 --> 00:01:17,609
federally you're still at risk and

27
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:20,100
families like Kristen suffered her dad

28
00:01:17,609 --> 00:01:22,920

29
00:01:20,099 --> 00:01:26,219
Williams is still in prison the good

30
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:29,790
news is is this last week sherry floor

31
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:32,400
was standing on stage in Seattle for

32
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:33,930
their march she has now been about two

33
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,930
weeks as she can finally have her

34
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:39,720
medicine she will never get her husband

35
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:42,090

36
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:45,060
wasn't there for him but she's finally

37
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:47,100
getting some of her freedom back now

38
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:50,189
when people get out of prison they're

39
00:01:47,099 --> 00:01:53,489
not done they still have a record they

40
00:01:50,188 --> 00:01:55,529
still struggle to get jobs as many of

41
00:01:53,489 --> 00:01:57,478
them are still on paper they can't even

42
00:01:55,530 --> 00:02:00,780
have all of their rights back when they

43
00:01:57,478 --> 00:02:02,489
first get out and so many of them are

44
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:04,649
still there many people to tell me Oh

45
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:06,089
Mindy they're not there people people

46
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:09,239
