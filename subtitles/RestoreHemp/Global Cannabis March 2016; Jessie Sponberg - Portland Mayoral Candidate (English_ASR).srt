1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,359
okay so for those that don't know my

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:08,940
name is Jesse sparber I'm a lifelong

3
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:12,000
resident Portland I'm a medical

4
00:00:08,939 --> 00:00:17,250
marijuana patient and I'm running for

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:20,640
mayor of Portland ah and I'm running on

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:22,890
a couple basic platforms like social

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,890
justice and environmental stewardship

8
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:28,109
and accountability and transparency but

9
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:30,599
one of my biggest when my biggest

10
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:37,829
platforms is marijuana because we all

11
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:39,659
love marijuana right so I go to a lot of

12
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:41,670
debates these days and everybody always

13
00:00:39,659 --> 00:00:44,369
ask the question of me and the other

14
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:47,429
candidates they always say how are you

15
00:00:44,369 --> 00:00:50,189
going to create more revenue for the

16
00:00:47,429 --> 00:00:55,948
city and they always got two answers

17
00:00:50,189 --> 00:01:00,349
either cut programs or raise taxes and I

18
00:00:55,948 --> 00:01:03,299
sit there stoned and I think to myself

19
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:05,280
do you guys not know anything about pot

20
00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:08,700
and then I realized that they really

21
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:11,280
don't anybody who survived the last

22
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:15,090
couple years of debacle trying to get to

23
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:17,430
him stock permits understands how little

24
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:19,259
the people that are making the decisions

25
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:22,380
for our city really understand about

26
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:24,478
marijuana I was shocked to find out that

27
00:01:22,379 --> 00:01:31,289
none of the five people on city council

28
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:34,650
had ever even been to him stock I found

29
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:40,829
out the other day the Ted wheeler and

30
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:45,530
Jules Bailey never ever smoked pot Jules

31
00:01:40,828 --> 00:01:48,089
Bailey in fact voted against measure 91

32
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:51,450
but somehow those two guys got the

33
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:53,790
marijuana lobbyist endorsements and I'm

34
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:56,100
the guy speaking at the freakin global

35
00:01:53,790 --> 00:02:00,090
cannabis March cash rules everything

36
00:01:56,099 --> 00:02:02,609
around us people it's my transition

37
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:05,070
right here you know my whole life my

38
00:02:02,609 --> 00:02:08,209
grandmother and all her hippie friends

39
00:02:05,069 --> 00:02:11,430
all they wanted was to legalize a plant

40
00:02:08,209 --> 00:02:12,460
all right that's all we wanted man free

41
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:15,129
love

42
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:18,040
two fingers legalize a plan let

43
00:02:15,129 --> 00:02:20,500
everybody have it reduce the value of it

44
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:22,329
as a commodity make it no more important

45
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,889
than any other garden crop that you

46
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:25,870
would share with your neighbors like

47
00:02:23,889 --> 00:02:27,459
zucchinis or when you get too many

48
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:31,180
tomatoes you share them with your

49
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:34,360
neighbors right but greed has touched

50
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:37,030
everything around us and really it's the

51
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:40,240
lobby and interests that are messing

52
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:43,509
this [ __ ] up and if you don't believe

53
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:47,230
that then you have to all you have to do

54
00:02:43,509 --> 00:02:51,729
is ask yourself why the hell would Ted

55
00:02:47,229 --> 00:02:55,179
wheeler get an endorsement from the

56
00:02:51,729 --> 00:02:57,969
marijuana people don't we understand

57
00:02:55,180 --> 00:03:01,090
that money is what's ruining all of this

58
00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:03,699
not just our politics but our personal

59
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:06,729
freaking hash pipes you know I'm saying

60
00:03:03,699 --> 00:03:09,909
hey this is all intersectional the gree

61
00:03:06,729 --> 00:03:12,129
rules all of this so there's two points

62
00:03:09,909 --> 00:03:17,650
I want to make and they relate to greed

63
00:03:12,129 --> 00:03:19,930
really the first one is some of you guys

64
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:22,750
are really disappointing me okay so look

65
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:25,569
legalization is brand new nobody knows

66
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:28,300
how this works nobody knows when you go

67
00:03:25,569 --> 00:03:30,250
to free marijuana mondays how to act do

68
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:32,500
you stand in line do you Ron do you yell

69
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:34,569
do you trample do you smoke on premises

70
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:36,550
when you come to a place like this do

71
00:03:34,569 --> 00:03:38,560
you yelled you heckle when you're doing

72
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:42,150
hash deals with people how do you act

73
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:45,789
look it's our job in this new frontier

74
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:50,409
to create the social norms and the rules

75
00:03:45,789 --> 00:03:51,789
by the way [ __ ] operates right and I

76
00:03:50,409 --> 00:03:54,549
don't think we're doing a very good job

77
00:03:51,789 --> 00:03:56,379
of it you guys are really disappointing

78
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:59,590
me with all the stories that I hear

79
00:03:56,379 --> 00:04:02,799
about people burning each other you know

80
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:06,129
I'm saying people like Anthony Hardy and

81
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:07,810
Anthony shanks and I woke up this

82
00:04:06,129 --> 00:04:10,449
morning to find out another dispensary

83
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:12,189
burned another friend this [ __ ] is shady

84
00:04:10,449 --> 00:04:15,439
and I don't know if it's cuz y'all smoke

85
00:04:12,189 --> 00:04:18,410
too many dabs and that's just like crack

86
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:21,139
but I mostly stick to flower so I can

87
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:24,980
see how this is turning into a dangerous

88
00:04:21,139 --> 00:04:27,529
sub culture of drugs no different than

89
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:30,710
the dope game or the crack game it's not

90
00:04:27,529 --> 00:04:33,199
supposed to be like the dope game it's

91
00:04:30,709 --> 00:04:35,930
supposed to be the old ladies smoking

92
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:41,029
freaking fat joints on the backyard with

93
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:50,240
a bug light but that's okay because

94
00:04:41,029 --> 00:04:52,489
growing pains are natural we at this

95
00:04:50,240 --> 00:05:04,040
time last year it wasn't even legal to

96
00:04:52,490 --> 00:05:06,500
smoke so sorry I started daydreaming so

97
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:08,450
uh you guys are the ones who have the

98
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:11,269
responsibility and it's brave new

99
00:05:08,449 --> 00:05:15,079
frontier to set the standard for how you

100
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:18,979
behave now the reason that I want you to

101
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:23,359
elect me the mayor is because our city

102
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:26,090
council is not supportive of the small

103
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:29,689
business aspect of the marijuana

104
00:05:26,089 --> 00:05:31,639
industry right they don't care about the

105
00:05:29,689 --> 00:05:33,230
patients now listen I don't want you

106
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:35,899
misunderstood I don't have any

107
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:37,669
jurisdictional authority over the OHA I

108
00:05:35,899 --> 00:05:40,159
don't have any jurisdictional authority

109
00:05:37,668 --> 00:05:44,839
over the legislators down in Salem

110
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:47,030
they're screwing us right but I do have

111
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:49,909
the voice or will have the voice I do

112
00:05:47,029 --> 00:05:51,559
right now I'm a soapbox but imagine the

113
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:54,470
soapbox that I would have as the mayor

114
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:57,290
of Portland turning Portland into the

115
00:05:54,470 --> 00:06:00,470
biggest marijuana capital in the world

116
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:03,110
you know I'm saying there's no reason

117
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:05,419
that we can't just take everything over

118
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:08,180
