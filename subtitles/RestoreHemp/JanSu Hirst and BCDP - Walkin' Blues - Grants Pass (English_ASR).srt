00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,620
I want to remind you we're all here for

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:07,679
the Oregon cannabis tax act because it

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:09,539
is time to re-legalize cannabis hemp in

4
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:11,218
this country

5
00:00:09,539 --> 00:00:13,079
we just had a decision from the Oregon

6
00:00:11,218 --> 00:00:14,759
Supreme Court that said all you medical

7
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,278
marijuana patients are second-class

8
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:20,219
citizens you can be fired just for what

9
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:22,618
medicine you're taking boo hoo that

10
00:00:20,219 --> 00:00:24,358
sucks that's why we need to legalize it

11
00:00:22,618 --> 00:00:26,219
we will always be treated second-class

12
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:30,300
citizens until it's legal for everyone

13
00:00:26,219 --> 00:00:32,939

17
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:39,839
