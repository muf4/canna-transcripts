1
00:00:01,139 --> 00:00:05,819
well welcome

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:10,679
the gasification 101.

3
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:12,839
oh in 1990 Don and I became the first

4
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:17,339
people pressing hemp seed oil

5
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:17,339
in the United States since 1937.

6
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:22,920
from all of what Jack was saying I

7
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:25,618
thought

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:28,618
lots of people are already doing it

9
00:00:25,618 --> 00:00:31,018
turned out we were pioneers

10
00:00:28,618 --> 00:00:34,079
the hemp is grown primarily for the

11
00:00:31,018 --> 00:00:37,679
nutritious seed as is the

12
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:40,620
flaxseed and I in the past considered

13
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:43,500
flax a competitor to him but the both of

14
00:00:40,619 --> 00:00:46,979
them have an incredibly similar history

15
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:50,640
the energy in the hemp herds

16
00:00:46,979 --> 00:00:53,398
is about 8 000 BTUs per pound on a

17
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:56,939
moisture and Ash free basis

18
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:59,879
the gasification equipment

19
00:00:56,939 --> 00:01:03,599
does pyrolysis followed by gasification

20
00:00:59,878 --> 00:01:06,060
pyrolysis is where the plant material is

21
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,519
heated to turn it into charcoal and

22
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:10,978
about half of the energy is in the solid

23
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:13,618
charcoal at the end of pyrolysis and the

24
00:01:10,978 --> 00:01:15,478
other half is in the gases and the tars

25
00:01:13,618 --> 00:01:16,920
that burn off in the making of the

26
00:01:15,478 --> 00:01:20,280
charcoal

27
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:22,500
so my gasification technology takes

28
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:27,659
those tars which would gum up an engine

29
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:29,938
and it turns them into a tar free gas

30
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:32,219
which can be readily cleaned up and run

31
00:01:29,938 --> 00:01:34,798
an engine

32
00:01:32,219 --> 00:01:37,379
we can take what we can take the

33
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:40,020
charcoal as a solid before it's gasified

34
00:01:37,379 --> 00:01:43,859
you put it in the soil

35
00:01:40,019 --> 00:01:46,379
and it makes biochar and wood will rock

36
00:01:43,859 --> 00:01:48,599
and if we don't do anything with wood or

37
00:01:46,379 --> 00:01:51,420
hemp herds or plant materials the soil

38
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:54,000
organisms will burn them into CO2 and

39
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:56,280
water vapor just as if we had used them

40
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,280
and burned them ourselves

41
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:02,219
but if we can do work

42
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:06,239
with our gasifier that prevents the use

43
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:08,520
of petroleum fossil fuels

44
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:12,359
we can have a major benefit on the

45
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:15,300
climate because the energy that's spewed

46
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:18,900
out by a hundred gallons of gasoline is

47
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:21,540
one full ton of CO2 greenhouse gas is

48
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:22,680
spewed out for each 100 gallons of

49
00:02:21,539 --> 00:02:24,598
gasoline

50
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,939
if you want to know what your you know

51
00:02:24,598 --> 00:02:28,859
your carbon footprint is look at it in

52
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:31,939
terms of how many gallons you burn

53
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,940
that's a big part of it
