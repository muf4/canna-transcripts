1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,500
hip Industries Association we are the

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:08,160
national nonprofit here in the US we've

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:10,830
just had our 22nd annual conference so

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,539
that's 22 years and Association fighting

5
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:15,449
for the rights of industrial hemp in

6
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:17,669
this country and also facilitating the

7
00:00:15,449 --> 00:00:19,528
rights of so many others as we it was

8
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:21,330
reiterated in the panel before saying

9
00:00:19,528 --> 00:00:22,948
that the rest of the world is really

10
00:00:21,329 --> 00:00:25,079
looking to what is happening with

11
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:26,449
cannabis movement legislation view

12
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:29,368
what's happening the United States

13
00:00:26,449 --> 00:00:32,669
thankfully is a hip industry we have our

14
00:00:29,368 --> 00:00:35,340
international partners to really help us

15
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:37,019
take this sector to the next level if we

16
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:39,059
look at something like building material

17
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:41,160
this is from Chris's booth this is a

18
00:00:39,058 --> 00:00:43,289
block he made it hip technologies which

19
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:45,449
is my principal and the company that we

20
00:00:43,289 --> 00:00:47,789
are members of the HIA which as I said

21
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:50,340
is a national nonprofit this is a burn

22
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:52,800
test he did on a block he made in one of

23
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:55,410
our workshops so imagine how long was

24
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:56,878
this here just one minute so one minute

25
00:00:55,409 --> 00:00:59,069
burn you can imagine her house we have

26
00:00:56,878 --> 00:01:01,349
it end up going up in flames if this was

27
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:04,079
to happen so just for instance of one of

28
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:05,820
the materials there I am based in

29
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:07,349
Manitoba Canada i am from joplin

30
00:01:05,819 --> 00:01:10,919
missouri where i've just completed my

31
00:01:07,349 --> 00:01:13,259
15th season of sampling for the hip

32
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,478
regulation based on THC it is something

33
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:18,118
also that we're we are looking and

34
00:01:15,478 --> 00:01:21,269
fighting for the change in the arbitrary

35
00:01:18,118 --> 00:01:23,640
THC level in the plant itself if thin

36
00:01:21,269 --> 00:01:27,420
candidates also point three percent in

37
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:29,489
the GPU at point two percent THC

38
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:31,350
and in addition to that we have a

39
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:33,030
derivative testing requirements so that

40
00:01:31,349 --> 00:01:35,129
means that all the head foods at come

41
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:37,829
from Canada into this country have also

42
00:01:35,129 --> 00:01:39,658
been tested for THC word and that's at

43
00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:42,269
10 parts per million where we're saying

44
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:44,280
since 1998 we have been sending healthy

45
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:46,140
head foods into this country from plants

46
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,478
that have been point three percent THC

47
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:51,359
and nobody has ever failed a workplace

48
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:53,039
drug test from consuming hemp foods from

49
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:55,228
plans that are point three percent so we

50
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:57,478
know we have that level of efficacy to

51
00:01:55,228 --> 00:02:00,090
move forward to help shift the change in

52
00:01:57,478 --> 00:02:03,329
the THC requirement unfortunately right

53
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:06,090
now well unfortunately we do have the

54
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:08,008
bills in congressional in Congress and

55
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:09,810
the Senate and the House of

56
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:11,429
Representatives to legalize industrial

57
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:13,469
hemp but that is written two-point-three

58
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:15,150
percent so if we want to make this

59
00:02:13,469 --> 00:02:17,879
change at something also that we've got

60
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:19,650
to really consider what we've got to

61
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:21,689
change in our federal legislation right

62
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:23,849
now to help facilitate that in the in

63
00:02:21,689 --> 00:02:26,219
Australia the root percentage is one

64
00:02:23,849 --> 00:02:27,900
percent THC and that's because it falls

65
00:02:26,219 --> 00:02:30,930
under something called the poisons act

66
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:33,209
and not anything to do with the outside

67
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:35,099
of really different with THC percentage

68
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:39,689
but these are regulations right now we

69
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:41,519
do have around 27 28 states somewhere

70
00:02:39,689 --> 00:02:43,560
right in there it could have changed up

71
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:46,140
on Friday for all I know

72
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:48,209
24 states that have legalized the

73
00:02:46,139 --> 00:02:49,708
cultivation of industrial hemp in the

74
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:52,830
United States in accordance with section

75
00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:55,949
7 606 of the farm bill and this year we

76
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:57,690
had eight states cultivating industrial

77
00:02:55,949 --> 00:02:59,818
hemp underneath that farmville

78
00:02:57,689 --> 00:03:02,370
legislation so that's really great

79
00:02:59,818 --> 00:03:04,500
bringing farmers back to the farm I

80
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:06,989
wonder if they've ever faced we have

81
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:09,330
seen a lot of youth farmers coming back

82
00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:11,580
so that's really empowering coming from

83
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:13,769
working with farmers in Canada and now

84
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:16,290
seeing the shift of people in their 30s

85
00:03:13,769 --> 00:03:18,390
and 40s and even younger getting excited

86
00:03:16,289 --> 00:03:20,459
about staying on the family farm because

87
00:03:18,389 --> 00:03:22,979
they have the hope and opportunity to

88
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:25,849
cultivate cannabis and industrial hemp

89
00:03:22,979 --> 00:03:25,849
very cool
