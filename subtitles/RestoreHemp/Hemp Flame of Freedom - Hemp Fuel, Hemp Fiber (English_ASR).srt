1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,009
as long as people are just being locked

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:06,509
up for cannabis then we've got to change

3
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:08,669
those laws and we've got to restore him

4
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:10,230
for energy folks that's the real key

5
00:00:08,669 --> 00:00:13,559
here the whole reason marijuana was

6
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:16,618
prohibited was to stop this to stop

7
00:00:13,558 --> 00:00:19,320
hemp fuel being used now this is hemp

8
00:00:16,618 --> 00:00:22,429
seed oil with a piece of hemp twine here

9
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:25,560
this is next week's wick right here and

10
00:00:22,429 --> 00:00:27,028
you can burn this in any deal in June

11
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:28,379
with no conversion to the engine today

12
00:00:27,028 --> 00:00:29,879
you pour that right into your diesel

13
00:00:28,379 --> 00:00:31,349
engine and turn the key and drive and

14
00:00:29,879 --> 00:00:33,289
that's the reason it was made illegal

15
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:35,820
it's the petrochemical pharmaceutical

16
00:00:33,289 --> 00:00:39,479
military industrial transnational

17
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:41,759
corporate elite crony capitalists ruling

18
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:44,539
class that have brought us hemp and

19
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:44,539
cannabis prohibition
