1
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:21,839
feeling

2
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:25,118
the feeling

3
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:25,118
of something gone wrong

4
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:31,839
how do you define

5
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,839
what you can't explain

6
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:39,520
into dragging on

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,520
hunger gnaws on law

8
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:46,879
and in self-defense

9
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,879
long keeps gnawing back

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,079
sometimes the thoughts

11
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:56,558
don't know what to think

12
00:00:54,079 --> 00:01:00,878
and where i've been

13
00:00:56,558 --> 00:01:00,878
doesn't remember a thing about me

14
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:09,200
something strange going on

15
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:11,680
everything that had unraveled

16
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:14,000
and now it's raveling back

17
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,960
into all i thought

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,959
i'd escaped

19
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:23,759
those places i don't want to go

20
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,640
but don't want could care less

21
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:29,280
about any of that

22
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:32,000
not with its own need

23
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,000
for a fix

24
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:36,640
looking

25
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:38,078
at what's been done

26
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,840
all i did

27
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:41,839
was go along for the ride

28
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:50,079
in a shadowing of light

29
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:54,280
flung to the edge collided with reality

30
00:01:50,078 --> 00:01:54,279
and reality didn't even

31
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,280
those dreams

32
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:15,680
marked by scars

33
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:19,759
the rampage question is

34
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,760
who would want to scar a dream

35
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,439
maybe

36
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,560
its scars

37
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:26,560
need dreams too

38
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:31,359
riding

39
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:35,119
a shattering or breaking

40
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,120
into an echo of silence

41
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:39,598
that bitter taste

42
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:43,399
looks

43
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:43,399
for someone sweet

44
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:03,439
feeling

45
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:06,400
the feeling

46
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:06,400
something gone wrong

47
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:12,560
how do you define

48
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,560
what you can't explain

49
00:03:12,878 --> 00:03:20,560
in a shadowing of light

50
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:22,640
flung to the edge collided with reality

51
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:26,280
and reality

52
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:26,279
didn't even blink

53
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,920
you
