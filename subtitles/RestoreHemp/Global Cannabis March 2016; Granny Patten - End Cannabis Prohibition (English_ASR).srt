1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,230
I would like to dedicate this speech to

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:09,809
Aaliyah she's an 11 year old child in

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:13,048
the great state of Kentucky she has the

4
00:00:09,808 --> 00:00:15,629
same rare illness I have unfortunately

5
00:00:13,048 --> 00:00:18,858
for that child she isn't unable to get

6
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:21,570
the oil she needs we know it's my story

7
00:00:18,859 --> 00:00:25,109
that it's important that this oil become

8
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:29,129
legal folks my illness it's rare and

9
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:31,170
incurable the doctors give you a

10
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:33,299
prescription for medicine that shut your

11
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:36,090
kidneys down when they're done with that

12
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:38,640
they give you a brain shunt surgery that

13
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:41,160
most people don't even survive and if

14
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,469
you do you have to keep having those

15
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:47,308
surgeries over and over to replace the

16
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:50,960
shunt I said no to that surgery three

17
00:00:47,308 --> 00:00:53,878
years ago I use only cannabis oil it is

18
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:56,939
absolutely all naturally keeps my spinal

19
00:00:53,878 --> 00:00:59,128
pressure down just as well as the stuff

20
00:00:56,939 --> 00:01:03,269
the doctors are giving people that is

21
00:00:59,128 --> 00:01:06,658
not working very important that we get

22
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:10,130
this federle legalized folks kids are

23
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:12,930
dying people are dying for this oil

24
00:01:10,129 --> 00:01:15,179
every day I get messages from people

25
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:18,689
around the country they need it

26
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:22,380
legalized we live in a state that we've

27
00:01:18,688 --> 00:01:25,618
got the blessing here that we do have at

28
00:01:22,379 --> 00:01:28,949
least some type of freedom here we need

29
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:31,078
to set an example folks we're the ones

30
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:33,450
that need to set an example for the

31
00:01:31,078 --> 00:01:35,938
other states I'm going to go ahead and

32
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:37,950
read what I wrote today simply because I

33
00:01:35,938 --> 00:01:40,618
have a brain disease so I don't have

34
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:42,689
really good memory plus I take two grams

35
00:01:40,618 --> 00:01:46,219
of cannabis oil a day so I'm going to

36
00:01:42,688 --> 00:01:46,219
here goes i'm going to read what I wrote

37
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:53,909
hello I have three important words I

38
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:57,960
want to share with you all we all matter

39
00:01:53,909 --> 00:02:00,659
I would like to say thank you all for

40
00:01:57,959 --> 00:02:02,669
showing up to support cannabis there are

41
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:05,520
so many people who are depending on all

42
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:07,379
of us to be their voices people ask me

43
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:08,530
what is it going to take to get better

44
00:02:07,379 --> 00:02:12,240
legalization

45
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:14,979
and and I tell him this number one

46
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:16,780
eliminate the fear factor by setting a

47
00:02:14,979 --> 00:02:18,969
good example just what I was talking

48
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:20,979
about we're blessed to be living in a

49
00:02:18,969 --> 00:02:23,680
state that is allowing us to have some

50
00:02:20,979 --> 00:02:25,299
freedom where cannabis is concerned we

51
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,659
need to use this freedom to show

52
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:30,610
compassion and grace so other states

53
00:02:28,659 --> 00:02:32,859
will see that the laws in their states

54
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:35,950
are unfair and that people will greatly

55
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:38,020
benefit from medical cannabis we also

56
00:02:35,949 --> 00:02:40,988
need to show others that people use

57
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:46,570
cannabis are great and very responsible

58
00:02:40,989 --> 00:02:49,450

59
00:02:46,569 --> 00:02:51,459

60
00:02:49,449 --> 00:02:56,439

61
00:02:51,459 --> 00:02:59,560

there's millions of you use your voice

68
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:21,819
to get it done we also need to start

69
00:03:19,629 --> 00:03:25,180
sharing these success stories with

70
00:03:21,819 --> 00:03:28,269
doctors and the lawmakers they hear

71
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:29,980
stories of like I said from me but

72
00:03:28,269 --> 00:03:34,090
they're not hearing it enough from you

73
00:03:29,979 --> 00:03:38,798

cause not hurt it okay this starts here

81
00:03:56,949 --> 00:04:02,889
in our own communities and our state

82
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:04,989
officials number five start pressing for

83
00:04:02,889 --> 00:04:07,988
cannabis to be federally studied by

84
00:04:04,989 --> 00:04:10,090
accredited doctors we need some deaf

85
00:04:07,989 --> 00:04:12,789
studies done

86
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:14,769
for those that don't know my story like

87
00:04:12,789 --> 00:04:17,469
I told you I do have a rare brain

88
00:04:14,769 --> 00:04:22,780
disease but I'm kicking its ass using

89
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:29,680
cannabis oil okay one more thing I would

90
00:04:22,779 --> 00:04:31,329
just like to quote my human rights we

91
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,850
hold these truths to be self-evident

92
00:04:31,329 --> 00:04:38,728
that all men are created equal that they

93
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:45,930
are endowed by their creator because

94
00:04:38,728 --> 00:04:45,930
damn it anyway let's make it legal
