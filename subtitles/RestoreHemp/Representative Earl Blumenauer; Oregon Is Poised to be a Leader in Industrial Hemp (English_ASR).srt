1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
20 states that passed pro industrial

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:13,888
chemical legislation and more telling

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:17,039
ten states including or you have passed

4
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:18,660
legislation that remove barriers to its

5
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:22,160
production

6
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:25,050
let me read them California Colorado

7
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:27,719
Kentucky Maine Montana North Dakota

8
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:32,489
Oregon Vermont Washington and West

9
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:36,808
Virginia pretty wide range of states all

10
00:00:32,488 --> 00:00:40,589
across the country now as I think most

11
00:00:36,808 --> 00:00:41,519
of you know hemp products are perfectly

12
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:45,530
legal

13
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:50,250
today there is a retail market and no

14
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:52,920
products we think is about half a

15
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:56,100
billion dollars now I frankly think

16
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:57,989
that's understated we've watched the

17
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,879
estimate since I've been working on this

18
00:00:57,988 --> 00:01:02,669
the estimates kind of go up about the

19
00:00:59,878 --> 00:01:04,649
range of the market and I will tell you

20
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:08,969
that I'm convinced if we're able to move

21
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:11,700
forward with actual hemp cultivation in

22
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:15,750
Oregon and other states I think that

23
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:17,640
market is going to expand them there'll

24
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:21,090
be more competition for it and it can be

25
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:22,950
grown locally not imported from Europe

26
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:26,689
or Canada or come checked out or

27
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:30,600
someplace so it's the supply line is

28
00:01:26,688 --> 00:01:33,868
shorter and the competition is greater

29
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:37,890
so I think that means that it's going to

30
00:01:33,868 --> 00:01:41,400
have overall an opportunity to make hemp

31
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:42,649
products even more competitive than they

32
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,329
are now

33
00:01:42,649 --> 00:01:50,728
additionally it's going to I think the

34
00:01:45,328 --> 00:01:53,429
attention that is going to be directed

35
00:01:50,728 --> 00:01:56,578
as a result of what's going on in Oregon

36
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:58,409
and other states we're going to watch

37
00:01:56,578 --> 00:02:01,618
the expansion so I think there will be

38
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:02,219
more attention more involvement and I

39
00:02:01,618 --> 00:02:04,829
think

40
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:07,890
to see even more commercial applications

41
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:10,439
so from my point of view it's gone from

42
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:14,270
less than a third of a billion to 1/2

43
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:17,099
billion and I think it's going to expand

44
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:21,290
dramatically you see some of the

45
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:23,939
products out there this is a hemp flag

46
00:02:21,289 --> 00:02:27,169
journal Pulis and I arranged for it to

47
00:02:23,939 --> 00:02:36,150
be flown over the United States Capitol

48
00:02:27,169 --> 00:02:40,229
on July 4th now it's important to clear

49
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:41,780
up the misconceptions industrial yeah

50
00:02:40,229 --> 00:02:49,500
I'll let you repeat after me

51
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:53,240
industrial him is not marijuana you want

52
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:56,719
to practice that in other groups it's

53
00:02:53,240 --> 00:03:01,170
it's really frustrated there's less than

54
00:02:56,719 --> 00:03:03,840
three tenths of a percent of THC it's

55
00:03:01,169 --> 00:03:07,369
not a drug now we can argue about

56
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:12,269
outdated drug laws anyway I mean is

57
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:15,319
marijuana really worse than heroin and

58
00:03:12,269 --> 00:03:18,209
meth but that's a debate for another day

59
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:20,389
we don't need to get into it I don't

60
00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:26,219
want to get into it I want to focus on

61
00:03:20,389 --> 00:03:31,259
him regardless of your view about other

62
00:03:26,219 --> 00:03:34,590
drug laws this is Nigel and we need to

63
00:03:31,259 --> 00:03:37,889
come together to help people understand

64
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:40,319
that and what the opportunities are I've

65
00:03:37,889 --> 00:03:44,219
been listening to people who've been

66
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:47,188
cornering me for decades some of you

67
00:03:44,219 --> 00:03:50,938
have been stalking me

68
00:03:47,188 --> 00:03:53,818
but but the point has been rotated and

69
00:03:50,938 --> 00:03:56,938
so we've been working as part of a whole

70
00:03:53,818 --> 00:04:01,768
range of issues in Congress to get this

71
00:03:56,938 --> 00:04:09,199
thing off the table get it passed get it

72
00:04:01,769 --> 00:04:13,799
accepted now part of what's interesting

73
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:18,238
for me is that the controversy

74
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:21,509
surrounding marijuana is going to help

75
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:28,198
us sweep through some of the

76
00:04:21,509 --> 00:04:32,099
misconceptions as you know 21 states in

77
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:37,199
the District of Columbia have legalized

78
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:40,199
medical marijuana over 110 million

79
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:43,530
people live in states that have medical

80
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:47,750
marijuana where it's illegal and this

81
00:04:43,529 --> 00:04:53,309
fall to states Washington and Colorado

82
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:57,209
voted to legalize adult recreational use

83
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:59,910
of marijuana what happened is it set up

84
00:04:57,209 --> 00:05:01,918
this is set up an interesting conflict

85
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:05,130
with federal law

86
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:08,098
again not debating the merits one way or

87
00:05:05,129 --> 00:05:11,370
another destination but President Obama

88
00:05:08,098 --> 00:05:13,800
famously said when when challenged is

89
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:17,728
the Department of Justice going to be

90
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:19,079
prosecuting Colorado officials for doing

91
00:05:17,728 --> 00:05:21,779
what they're required to do in the state

92
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:24,329
constitution which over 55% of the

93
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:28,408
people told him to do and the president

94
00:05:24,329 --> 00:05:29,620
said then he had bigger fish to fry and

95
00:05:28,408 --> 00:05:33,969
that's true

96
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:38,019
and so we had this statement from the

97
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:41,169
administration which was logical and a

98
00:05:38,019 --> 00:05:43,349
way to avoid an unfortunate conflict

99
00:05:41,168 --> 00:05:46,930
between the state and federal

100
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:50,879
authorities we do have bigger fish to

101
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:54,430
fry the problem was that there were 83

102
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:58,860
independent US attorneys who were frying

103
00:05:54,430 --> 00:06:02,680
those smaller fish so we sought and

104
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:06,610
obtained clarification from the

105
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:09,490
Department of Justice that they would

106
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:11,288
not essentially be prosecuting people

107
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:15,120
who are operating under the color of

108
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:19,750
state law and set up some conditions

109
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:25,269
whereby that would be respected well

110
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:29,860
this helps us even more because if you

111
00:06:25,269 --> 00:06:31,750
can have a regimen in these states for

112
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:33,490
medical or recreational marijuana is

113
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:34,839
legal and you can do this to the

114
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:39,579
satisfaction of the Department of

115
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:45,549
Justice it would be a no-brainer to set

116
00:06:39,579 --> 00:06:49,079
up a system where by him meets that

117
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:54,160
criteria and would not be prosecuted

118
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:56,250
it's it's very for me exciting to have

119
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:59,229
that guidance from the US attorney

120
00:06:56,250 --> 00:07:02,680
laying out the priorities but even more

121
00:06:59,228 --> 00:07:06,129
important for us and worrying the US

122
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:08,918
attorney Amanda Marshall has stated that

123
00:07:06,129 --> 00:07:11,639
her position will be to rely on state

124
00:07:08,918 --> 00:07:14,939
and local authorities to address

125
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:17,490
localized activities

126
00:07:14,939 --> 00:07:20,160
and in a recent letter we make copies I

127
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:21,990
think from US attorney Marshall the

128
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:25,560
department expects that states which

129
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:28,259
legalized cultivation or use of cannabis

130
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:30,329
whether for industrial purposes medical

131
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:32,819
purposes or otherwise will establish

132
00:07:30,329 --> 00:07:34,859
them for strict regulatory schemes that

133
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:37,079
protect the eight federal interests that

134
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:40,350
are identified they will take a trust

135
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:42,000
but verify approach and as long as the

136
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:44,820
state follows suit imposing those

137
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:50,160
controls it's not likely that they will

138
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:51,750
be there will be any threatens federal

139
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,280
act and federal action unless necessary

140
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:55,050
look at the actual language but the

141
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:59,519
point is if that's the case for

142
00:07:55,050 --> 00:08:01,470
marijuana it certainly it informs the

143
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:05,069
guidance for him so it ought to be

144
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:06,780
easier more direct and virtually no

145
00:08:05,069 --> 00:08:10,409
reason that there would be any

146
00:08:06,779 --> 00:08:13,169
involvement and it's important for us to

147
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:16,380
give clarification to the men and women

148
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:20,120
who may decide to be involved that

149
00:08:16,379 --> 00:08:22,918
they're not going to be interfered with

150
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:24,360
and I hope that it gives the assurance

151
00:08:22,918 --> 00:08:30,149
to the state the state's been

152
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:31,770
extraordinarily I think forthcoming on

153
00:08:30,149 --> 00:08:33,029
this with the Department of Agriculture

154
00:08:31,769 --> 00:08:35,399
the state legislature

155
00:08:33,029 --> 00:08:37,288
so we're amazing well-positioned well

156
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:40,098
actually have an opportunity here from a

157
00:08:37,288 --> 00:08:45,649
representative from the State Department

158
00:08:40,099 --> 00:08:48,350
today now you may have noticed the last

159
00:08:45,649 --> 00:08:50,328
few months have not necessarily been the

160
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:56,389
shining moments for the United States

161
00:08:50,328 --> 00:09:00,500
Commerce there have been some

162
00:08:56,389 --> 00:09:03,500
controversies some dysfunction but for

163
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:06,769
me one of the highlights in a really

164
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:11,078
miserable period was watching in this

165
00:09:06,769 --> 00:09:16,278
Congress the moments of bipartisanship

166
00:09:11,078 --> 00:09:19,669
around the issue during the farm bill

167
00:09:16,278 --> 00:09:23,049
debate together with a colleague from

168
00:09:19,669 --> 00:09:27,349
Colorado here and published and one from

169
00:09:23,049 --> 00:09:30,309
Kentucky Thomas Massie a Republican from

170
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:34,250
Kentucky who has agreed to be our lead

171
00:09:30,309 --> 00:09:36,289
with the legislation in Congress we

172
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:39,019
could offer what we thought was shut the

173
00:09:36,289 --> 00:09:41,028
simple common-sense Amendment that's

174
00:09:39,019 --> 00:09:44,778
always a danger sign in Congress because

175
00:09:41,028 --> 00:09:47,448
those are the first to lose that would

176
00:09:44,778 --> 00:09:51,458
allow colleges and universities to grow

177
00:09:47,448 --> 00:09:56,078
and cultivate him for academic and

178
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:56,078
agricultural research purposes

179
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:09,400
passed with bipartisan support

180
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:12,399
I think it's 225 votes and that

181
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:15,399
provision is still on the table for the

182
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,870
farm bill discussion we have now and

183
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:21,189
we're working for the conference

184
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:22,480
committee is and some of the stuff it's

185
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:24,970
going to be in the bill makes me cringe

186
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:27,550
I don't know that I'm going to be able

187
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:30,670
to vote for it but I think we're going

188
00:10:27,549 --> 00:10:33,039
to be able to keep this provision and be

189
00:10:30,669 --> 00:10:35,919
able to do something else that's very

190
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:40,959
important it's not just to give a clear

191
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:42,759
signal to Oregon Agriculture that it is

192
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:45,670
appropriate for them to go forward if

193
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:50,080
they cultivate it as they see fit it's

194
00:10:45,669 --> 00:10:53,370
important to help them call me and for

195
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:56,200
us to be able to do the research that

196
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:58,779
OSU is capable of doing they do amazing

197
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:01,750
things there to help other Oregon

198
00:10:58,779 --> 00:11:04,569
industries from the cheesemakers people

199
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:08,590
who root beer wine small fruits and

200
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:11,020
vegetables their forestry and they there

201
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:14,560
are not just American experts they're

202
00:11:11,019 --> 00:11:18,389
global experts at OSU tremendously

203
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:18,389
powerful research capacity

204
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:27,850
people to research on him in terms of

205
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:31,959
how to grow it and product applications

206
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:37,209
that is a part of establishing a new

207
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:39,250
element for Horrigan industry we have

208
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:41,289
we're about to hear from an all-star

209
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:43,089
panel I think I've stalled long enough I

210
00:11:41,289 --> 00:11:43,719
think we've got everybody here is going

211
00:11:43,089 --> 00:11:51,220
to be here

212
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:54,670
although thank you cable access when

213
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:56,470
you're on your exercise machine and 2:00

214
00:11:54,669 --> 00:11:58,269
in the morning and just know might know

215
00:11:56,470 --> 00:12:00,610
what to do and you're tired of watching

216
00:11:58,269 --> 00:12:03,850
speeches on the floor of the house on

217
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:09,959
c-span or even as you'll be able to

218
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:09,959
watch this and listen from our experts

219
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:20,759
I went I did want to acknowledge how

220
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:25,089
helpful the Department of Agriculture's

221
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:26,588
kekova has been she's the director I'm

222
00:12:25,089 --> 00:12:30,310
talking through with her the nature of

223
00:12:26,589 --> 00:12:33,130
this federal partnership wholefoods

224
00:12:30,309 --> 00:12:35,649
a leader in adapting alternative

225
00:12:33,129 --> 00:12:38,500
products to retail markets and helping

226
00:12:35,649 --> 00:12:41,409
them become more mainstream thank you

227
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:43,149
hearing from Rick Rutherford and or a

228
00:12:41,409 --> 00:12:46,028
good farmer I just met for the first

229
00:12:43,149 --> 00:12:50,338
time from doofer who's interested in

230
00:12:46,028 --> 00:12:53,950
doing a deep dive and cultivating yeah

231
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:58,000
well I think the stakes are high Florida

232
00:12:53,950 --> 00:13:01,330
we want to be able to strengthen our

233
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:06,399
economy particularly what happens in

234
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:09,009
rural and small town or you being able

235
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:13,360
to have one more product that they can

236
00:13:09,009 --> 00:13:15,039
cultivate that has a number of

237
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,080
applications I think it's a step towards

238
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:20,349
helping the economy in an area that's

239
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:24,790
been battered by the recession and as we

240
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:27,580
research grow and be able to have access

241
00:13:24,789 --> 00:13:30,458
to them I think it's also going to know

242
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:33,550
small entrepreneurs you people who have

243
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:36,009
ideas for new products that can be more

244
00:13:33,549 --> 00:13:38,740
affordable and accessible so I think

245
00:13:36,009 --> 00:13:42,399
it's going to unleash other areas of

246
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:44,818
economic activity because this is a part

247
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:48,389
of an effort that we need to do here

248
00:13:44,818 --> 00:13:51,628
to support it encourage this process

249
00:13:48,389 --> 00:13:54,778
being set up with the with the state of

250
00:13:51,629 --> 00:13:56,459
Oregon the Department of Agriculture we

251
00:13:54,778 --> 00:14:00,298
want to learn from one another and we

252
00:13:56,458 --> 00:14:02,099
want to inform the public so we can lay

253
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:05,068
the foundation I would like Orion to be

254
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:07,889
a leader as we move to the point where

255
00:14:05,068 --> 00:14:10,378
it is clearly going to be authorized

256
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:12,239
under federal statute and we are doing

257
00:14:10,379 --> 00:14:14,548
more for research and product

258
00:14:12,239 --> 00:14:18,319
development but Oregon once again is

259
00:14:14,548 --> 00:14:18,318
poised to be a real leader
