1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,139
you know we're marching in conjunction

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:07,528
with over a million people around the

3
00:00:04,139 --> 00:00:10,910
world there's over 400,000 people

4
00:00:07,528 --> 00:00:13,798
marching today in Santiago Chile almost

5
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:18,839
200,000 people today in Buenos Aires

6
00:00:13,798 --> 00:00:21,778
Argentina 50,000 in Toronto Ontario you

7
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:24,899
know we've got some regulation in

8
00:00:21,778 --> 00:00:26,910
marijuana people are going to jail our

9
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:30,000
legislators done a good job in making

10
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:32,939
some good changes a few bad changes but

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,670
some good changes but there are a lot of

12
00:00:32,939 --> 00:00:38,339
people still going to jail around the

13
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:41,429
world and this is the global marijuana

14
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:45,989
march and we need global marijuana

15
00:00:41,429 --> 00:00:47,820
freedom and so until we have that we

16
00:00:45,988 --> 00:00:51,089
aren't going away you know marijuana

17
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:54,689
prohibition was never really about drugs

18
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:57,469
marijuana prohibition was always about

19
00:00:54,689 --> 00:00:59,968
money and power and the further

20
00:00:57,469 --> 00:01:02,939
centralization of economic and political

21
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:06,599
control marijuana prohibition is really

22
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:10,289
about energy it's really that we can

23
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:13,259
drive our cars on hip fuel and we will

24
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:17,580
when we can grow high THC cannabis

25
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:19,590
without regard to its THC content but

26
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:23,489
for the varieties that produce the best

27
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:26,009
seeds and the most seeds over 400

28
00:01:23,489 --> 00:01:28,530
gallons of hip seed per acre with a

29
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:33,650
byproduct of four tons of high protein

30
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:37,439
food at 40 tons of fiber we can not only

31
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:39,960
give the world clean energy we can wipe

32
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:42,779
out world hunger with the seed meal left

33
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:45,809
over we can stop deforestation with the

34
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:48,509
byproduct of fiber we can decentralize

35
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:52,500
wealth by taking money out of the hands

36
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:54,780
of Exxon Mobil the Saudi sheiks the

37
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:58,409
Nigerian despot instead of having all

38
00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:01,670
that money go in to their bank accounts

39
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:04,618
in the Bahamas the Caymans the Swiss

40
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:07,228
instead of it going there it'll go into

41
00:02:04,618 --> 00:02:09,659
our farmers pockets and that money will

42
00:02:07,228 --> 00:02:11,520
enrich shuts all and that's the main

43
00:02:09,659 --> 00:02:13,370
reason that marijuana was prohibited

44
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,510
it's really about

45
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:20,090
battle between the natural cycle and the

46
00:02:16,509 --> 00:02:22,429
synthetic cycle and the people who

47
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:24,469
brought us the lies about marijuana the

48
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:26,890
misinformation campaign are the

49
00:02:24,469 --> 00:02:29,750
petrochemical pharmaceutical

50
00:02:26,889 --> 00:02:31,789
military-industrial transnational

51
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:35,150
corporate elite fascist sons of a

52
00:02:31,789 --> 00:02:38,298
and when we could restore him

53
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:41,209
for fuel we will change our whole

54
00:02:38,299 --> 00:02:43,519
economic paradigm and reestablish

55
00:02:41,209 --> 00:02:45,680
freedom you know freedom isn't just

56
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:47,840
about speech assembly those are

57
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:51,650
important it's also about consciousness

58
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:54,530
and feeling good and hip grows on trees

59
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:57,319
it should be cheap it should be

60
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:59,739
plentiful when we start growing hip for

61
00:02:57,318 --> 00:03:02,780
fuel the whole world will change

62
00:02:59,739 --> 00:03:05,060
medicine will be cheap our economy will

63
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:07,939
decentralize and we'll have a

64
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:11,120
sustainable world and that's the goal

65
00:03:07,939 --> 00:03:14,150
and that's why I marching today want to

66
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:19,060
thank you guys for coming out here keep

67
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:19,060
working until we restore hip
