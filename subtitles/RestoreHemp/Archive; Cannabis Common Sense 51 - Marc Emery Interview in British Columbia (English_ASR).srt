the campaign for the restoration

19
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,520
regulation of hemp we have an initiative

00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,480
out there which paul is displaying

21
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:01,520
proudly it's the oregon campus tax act

22
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:04,798
this initiative is a comprehensive

23
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,880
regulation of marijuana it will allow

24
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,920
medical patients to purchase

25
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:11,920
marijuana at cost in pharmacies with a

26
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,920
prescription from a doctor it would

27
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,640
allow our farmers to grow industrial

28
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,719
hemp the low thc variety and it will

29
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,280
allow recreational

30
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:23,519
cannabis to be sold for profit at state

31
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,439
liquor stores with the money going into

32
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:27,039
our state coffers to lower all of our

33
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:29,438
tax rates of course

34
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,759
and part of the proceeds will then go

35
00:01:29,438 --> 00:01:33,758
into funding real drug education

36
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,079
programs and real substance abuse

37
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:38,159
programs

38
00:01:36,078 --> 00:01:40,158
yeah for the alcoholics and addicts that

39
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,680
need help and you know currently ninety

40
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,280
percent of the alcoholics who seek

41
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,000
treatment can't get it they're turned

42
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,519
away so we'll fund that with millions

43
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,159
maybe tens of millions of dollars it's

44
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:52,560
real hard to quantify what the black

45
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,640
market will do but we need your help to

46
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,519

with a picture on the wall street

86
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,360

they have in the wall street journal but

90
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:40,878
still if you're going to get anything in

91
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,319
the wall street journal it's going to be

92
00:03:40,878 --> 00:03:44,239
one of those little etch-a-sketch

93
00:03:42,318 --> 00:03:45,679
drawings well just to be perfectly

94
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,400
truthful here right it's not a

95
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,480
photograph but it's a picture a line

96
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,080
drawing but it's there in the wall

it's it's a big tourist draw he's really

107
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,840
cleaned up his neighborhood too yeah

108
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,238
that's the one of the kind of real

109
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,639
encouraging things is that with his

110
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:22,638
cannabis cafe and his retail store and

111
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:25,040
the legal assistance center all being on

112
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:27,040
one block up there in west hastings he

113
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:30,479
has turned that block around from being

114
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,800
a block full of balanced luck dirty

115
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:35,039
boarded up stores yeah panhandlers

116
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,040
everywhere and a lot of hard drug

117
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,600
addicts and alcoholics on the street now

118
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:42,319
it's it's a it's a bustling friendly

119
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,879
street that's true all of his neighbors

120
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:47,439
in the surrounding area support him and

121
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:50,719
thank him for building up the area

122
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:52,560
improving the area and uh bringing

123
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,280
thousands of tourists streaming right

124
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:58,399
into the the the edge of gas town in

125
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:59,839
downtown vancouver yeah and i think it's

126
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:01,599
probably our time to go to the interview

127
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:03,198
in this part of the interview

128
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,320
he's going to be talking about people

129
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:08,478
who have had to leave the united states

130
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:10,079
because of political pressure because if

131
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:12,240
they were growers or because they were

132
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:14,639
outspoken against the government who had

133
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,120
to leave and carried up these strains

134
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:20,319
that were developed in california oregon

135
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,720
washington up to canada and continued on

136
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:24,800
with their experiments up there

137
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,639
i think it's a quite fascinating

138
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,759
process of what happened

139
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:31,280
and just so i think without further ado

140
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,400
go to the interview

141
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:34,319
you know and that could be like some

142
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:36,319
poor bastards that i know who and my

143
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:38,000
first rate of a wonderful man like will

144
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:39,599
smith came up here from oklahoma and he

145
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,759
just got popped back in his own place

146
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,639
yeah and he was in jail for 95 years and

147
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,840
he said no no no no

148
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:49,680
he had four

149
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:50,879
42 plants allegedly allegedly and

150
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,319
he agreed to go back because they said

151
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:54,560
they wouldn't forfeit his property which

152
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:56,560
his family still lives in

153
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,800
his children and his wife and he got 20

154
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,478
years for 42 planets and they figured

155
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,120
he'll serve about seven to ten oh how

156
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:04,879
nice 42 [ __ ] plants man i've tripped

157
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,800
over 42 [ __ ] plants in some people's

158
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:08,240
grow rooms i mean i've had easily 42

159
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,160
plants in my own grow rooms and around

160
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,759
here you might get 500 to a thousand

161
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,240
dollars fine for that

162
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:16,960
20 years of a man's life can you imagine

163
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,639
there's no society so sick as we do that

164
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:21,038
and yet there is it's called the united

165
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,879
states of america and it's a bad bad

166
00:06:21,038 --> 00:06:24,879
place and there's thousands of americans

167
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:26,639
up here who are weed refugees who have

168
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:28,240
fled that in fact george van patten is

169
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,240
up here living now writing about

170
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,360
canadian grow operations and so many

171
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,478
people have come up here and it's been

172
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,000
great that's how we got our great pot in

173
00:06:32,478 --> 00:06:37,120
the first place american war resistors

174
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,319
came up here from 1968 to 1972 and they

175
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,319
bought all their best strains for them

176
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:42,000
they sailed in british columbia and they

177
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,600
gave british columbia which had no

178
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
particular reputation for ever growing

179
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,360
any good pot they gave it a fabulous

180
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,439
gene pool to produce the world's

181
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,879
greatest pot and these people stayed and

182
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:52,800
we continued to cultivate and the

183
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:54,879
situation got uh

184
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,038
hospitable here and more so in the

185
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:58,560
courts and over time we end up revolving

186
00:06:57,038 --> 00:06:59,759
towards the greatest pot and of course a

187
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,280
lot of stuff they sell in amsterdam is

188
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,439
produced out of seattle oregon and

189
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:04,638
british columbia more these days out of

190
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:06,560
british columbia because there's more

191
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,240
work going on here in the sense of

192
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,918
genetics breeding crossing things are

193
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,000
happening so much faster than the united

194
00:07:09,918 --> 00:07:13,519
states because there's really crushed

195
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,279
yeah exactly well

196
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:16,478
hey money is a great coward and what

197
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:18,478
happened is the expertise and the money

198
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:19,758
went north where you were if you were

199
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:22,000
smart and you want to grow a pot this is

200
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,520
where you'd grow it and that's what's

201
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,038
happened so portland of course they've

202
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:26,879
recriminalized marijuana they're at

203
00:07:25,038 --> 00:07:29,199
least that's what we stopped yeah thank

204
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:31,199
goodness about that

205
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,520
but that would be a terrible backwards

206
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:35,598
step terrible backwards step for oregon

207
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:37,680
that would really place it in the back

208
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:39,120
waters again like oklahoma where texas

209
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,639
where you know it's your three your face

210
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,120
with putting rest in spending the rest

211
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:45,439
of your life in jail growing pot

212
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,199
and you know why bother my advice is

213
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:48,399
just come up here you don't need to show

214
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,160
people you're american or canadian you

215
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:51,918
just need to show them the cash

216
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,280
as that cuba gooding line goes show me

217
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:55,038
the money it's still pretty relevant

218
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:56,478
anywhere and just get an asian landlord

219
00:07:55,038 --> 00:07:57,439
they don't bother you they never ask

220
00:07:56,478 --> 00:07:59,199
questions

221
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:00,879
and they're nice people and you should

222
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,800
you know deal with them the white people

223
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:05,919
are too [ __ ] nosy they're a pain in

224
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,919
the ass go with asians

225
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,759
that's why those white supremacists are

226
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:11,439
wrong right there to pod growers you

227
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:12,560
can't count on whitey to help you out

228
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:14,000
here they're the people that turn you in

229
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,079
they're calling 911. it's not the

230
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,519
chinese guys it's not the east indian

231
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:18,719
guys they don't want anybody knowing

232
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:20,079
what they're doing either so they're

233
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,440
just going to shut up

234
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:22,959
you know and everybody's got their own

235
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:24,079
private business except the white people

236
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:26,560
seem to think that they have a right to

237
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:28,159
be everybody's business in my opinion

238
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,598
and so you got to go for an asian

239
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,840
landlord

240
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:33,519
and people have a good success for that

241
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:35,038
i see

242
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:36,560
yeah you'll get some immigrants who see

243
00:08:35,038 --> 00:08:38,718
this show you never know

244
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:40,478
right and we'll probably get lost we get

245
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,278
them all the time they just show up here

246
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,320
and they

247
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:43,599
next you know they're acting like

248
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,879
canadians they're americans are hard you

249
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,278
can always tell because they're noisy if

250
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:48,720
you give them a chance

251
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:50,240
but you tell them just you know you

252
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,600
remember if you get caught yeah you

253
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,799
won't go to jail but you'll get deported

254
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,159
remember you get to go back to america

255
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:55,278
that's punishment enough so don't be so

256
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:56,799
american

257
00:08:55,278 --> 00:08:57,838
you know

258
00:08:56,799 --> 00:09:00,559
you know because they tend to be a

259
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:02,000
little more pushy brassy you know

260
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:03,278
nothing like a new yorker when you meet

261
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,799
them on a holiday or you can always spot

262
00:09:03,278 --> 00:09:06,080
them the loudest course they look like

263
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:07,278
they never relax they never went on

264
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,120
holiday they're

265
00:09:07,278 --> 00:09:10,879
selling but you know most americans

266
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,000
actually are pretty good but uh you know

267
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:13,278
you don't when you're in a foreign

268
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,958
country growing pot you don't really

269
00:09:13,278 --> 00:09:16,639
want to draw anybody's attention if you

270
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:17,838
can avoid it but you know even then

271
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:19,278
we've got some guys who are american are

272
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:21,360
going to be deported we got them out and

273
00:09:19,278 --> 00:09:23,919
they've got a refugee status claim going

274
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,240
we've got the uh soos who's from oregon

275
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:28,958
himself who invented product 19 or

276
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:31,440
developer who's a grower here he's now

277
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:32,799
having refugee hearings today and

278
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,320
they've accepted initially his claim

279
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:35,679
that he's a weed refugee which is what

280
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,879
our claim is that he would face

281
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:37,919
substantial penalties going back to the

282
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:39,679
united states that are unreasonable

283
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:41,519
cruel and usual which we can get here

284
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:43,120
and that's the basis of a claim

285
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,519
because cultivators don't go to jail

286
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,039
here in first or second offense

287
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,639
it doesn't matter how big a crop is you

288
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:50,000
know whereas you know in america you're

289
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:52,159
facing 10 years that could easily be

290
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,399
construed as cruel and mutual punishment

291
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:56,480
yeah i know so many people who have

292
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:58,320
unfortunately been locked away right now

293
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,680
yeah well all right

294
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,440
send them our way

295
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:02,958
don't let them go to jail for that

296
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,880
america's not worth sticking around for

297
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:06,079
five or ten years in prison you know

298
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:07,759
being a guest to the united states

299
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:10,000
government in that situation it's worth

300
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:12,639
deciding to look for greener pastures

301
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,639
and they're here

302
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,320
so is there any um

303
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,759
any backlash at all you see for anybody

304
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,360
talking about you know weed immigrants

305
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:20,639
coming up to vancouver no never had a

306
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,320
single complaint from the public i've

307
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:23,919
never had a letter never seen a letter

308
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,079
never seen a letter in the newspaper

309
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:27,360
never seen any kind of criticism about

310
00:10:26,078 --> 00:10:28,879
marijuana basically from the general

311
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,320
public at all you know the people you

312
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:31,120
see criticism from are always cops

313
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,560
they're always trying to spread some

314
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,600
bizarre propaganda because it props up

315
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:37,278
their own industry and the urine testing

316
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,440
people you know the people who are these

317
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:41,759
counselors the world's plagued with

318
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,760
counts of drug abuse counseling so i see

319
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:45,439
marijuana addicts every day in my office

320
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:46,958
i'm thinking yeah but it's like the rape

321
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,279
crisis council all you see is rape

322
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:51,119
victims all day but hey not everybody

323
00:10:49,278 --> 00:10:53,439
works the way you do we don't just all

324
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,799
see victims all day long the rest of us

325
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,920
are out in the real world where we've

326
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:57,838
got thousands of people with no

327
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:59,599
dependency problems they don't abuse

328
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:01,600
people they're not harmed so in the

329
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,879
general public you tend to meet 99 of

330
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,879
the public knows how to conduct

331
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:06,480
themselves properly and then one percent

332
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:07,838
doesn't and that's who these people see

333
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,680
they see the people who couldn't handle

334
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:12,800
reality and they end up with you

335
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:14,159
alcoholic heroin users whatever i mean

336
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:15,599
any guy who goes and says i'm addicted

337
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:17,600
to pot he's really looking for a

338
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,120
rationalization because why what do you

339
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,200
do well i don't get up well you're a

340
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,120
[ __ ] lazy son of a [ __ ] so stop

341
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,800
smoking pot and get to work right end of

342
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,240
story right he's not addicted he's just

343
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:27,919
[ __ ] lazy he was lazy before he

344
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,759
smoked pot he's lazy when he smoked pot

345
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:31,759
it'll be a lazy [ __ ] after he quits pot

346
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:33,600
too you know but that's they blame pot

347
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:34,639
because you know it's like parents you

348
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,560
know who when they then they're

349
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:38,480
teenagers it's not my son anymore he's

350
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:40,559
changed he's hanging around with hippie

351
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,720
chicks and smoking pot and going to

352
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:44,879
disney movies and rallies and there's

353
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,639
another kid i took fishing and yeah well

354
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:47,919
what happens he grew up and now he's on

355
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:49,360
his own and you don't like it so you're

356
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:50,719
blaming all the peripherals you know it

357
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,159
could be vegetarianism it could be

358
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,399
nudism it could be marijuana whatever

359
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:56,240
he's doing that you don't know that you

360
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,360
didn't do rather that's affecting his

361
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,440
you know that's a

362
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,039
symptom of his new way of living you're

363
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,200
going to blame that not your son it's

364
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:04,719
not he's not changing or anything you

365
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,399
know he's not becoming an adult and

366
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,000
making his own mind up you know it's the

367
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:09,839
drugs you know or something like that

368
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,519
whatever or you know the most common one

369
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:12,720
with my mom was blaming my girlfriend he

370
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,480
was such a nice boy until he started

371
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,480
going with all those women they changed

372
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,079
him right whatever you know marijuana is

373
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,680
just a popular scapegoat for a lot of

374
00:12:18,078 --> 00:12:22,159
people i always laugh when i hear that

375
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:24,000
because i mean invariably it's some drug

376
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:25,439
counselor guys well i see victims of

377
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,120
marijuana yeah well what are you you're

378
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,800
probably a former alco yourself isn't

379
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,159
that right yeah and i said what are you

380
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:32,319
doing with your living so you parlayed

381
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:33,759
your alcoholism into a life like career

382
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,760
opportunity well that's really

383
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:37,360
interesting sounds like a cop you know

384
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:38,559
go around morally lecture people if they

385
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,159
don't listen to you crack their skull

386
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:41,838
and you get paid for it i said that's

387
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:44,319
very interesting i said you have the

388
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:46,000
problem but we're made to pay you know

389
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,760
and then you get to lecture us about our

390
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,519
supposed problem which nobody said we

391
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:51,519
have one but you're clearly unable to

392
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,799
handle yourself so you've got a job as a

393
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,679
counselor because you've got lots of

394
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:56,799
experience being a dick you know

395
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:58,399
anyway

396
00:12:56,799 --> 00:13:00,000
world's full of people making a paycheck

397
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,240
on something wrong

398
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,879
yeah well i'd like to

399
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:07,039
ask is there any part of vancouver area

400
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:09,360
that you know the weed refugees are

401
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:11,278
moving to or taking over you intend to

402
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,360
be an east fan because every third house

403
00:13:11,278 --> 00:13:15,039
is a grow up there

404
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,639
south fan is a little more expensive and

405
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:18,480
a better place to be because it's more

406
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,320
residential but then see the problem is

407
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,079
to have a grow up in a lot of places

408
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,278
you've got to look like you're normal

409
00:13:22,078 --> 00:13:24,638
you know you've got to show up you've

410
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:26,078
got to be sweet to your neighbors you

411
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,440
got to sort of hang out you'd be great

412
00:13:26,078 --> 00:13:29,039
if you had kids living that's a good

413
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,480
cover but you know bottom line is you

414
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:32,078
tend not to the house tends to be all

415
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,680
one big [ __ ] grow operation that

416
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:35,120
you've rented out and you don't really

417
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:37,120
want people coming you don't want to see

418
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,720
them so it's a bit of an art you know

419
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,078
but unfortunately you know be grateful

420
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,839
we don't get all the government we pay

421
00:13:40,078 --> 00:13:44,159
for as well roger said because they have

422
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:45,760
more cops and basically the cops can't

423
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:47,360
keep up even if they bust someone every

424
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:49,679
[ __ ] day in the lower mainland they

425
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,959
certainly do that's peanuts they might

426
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:52,239
get you know maybe in all of the lower

427
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:55,039
mainland they get like a thousand grow

428
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,879
operations well there's at least 125

429
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:58,639
000 grow operations and the whole lower

430
00:13:56,879 --> 00:14:00,879
mainland it's like way beyond what they

431
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:02,480
can they'll never catch them all and it

432
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:04,000
you know they keep raising the threshold

433
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,680
well if it's under 20 plants we can't

434
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,198
bother with it it's under 30 plants we

435
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:08,719
can't bother well now it's under like

436
00:14:07,198 --> 00:14:10,319
100 plants we can't bother it because we

437
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,000
know hundreds of places that have more

438
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,920
than 100 plants and like you know they

439
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,759
stack them up and they keep whittling

440
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:17,519
them down and the threshold keeps rising

441
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:18,639
and basically the way to defeat this is

442
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,159
that more and more people have got to

443
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:21,360
grow pot don't worry about whether it's

444
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:23,120
illegal don't worry about what's going

445
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,199
to happen grow more pot because you're

446
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,720
forcing the threshold up if a whole

447
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:27,759
bunch of people start growing 25 50

448
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,600
plants then you know it's going to be

449
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:31,439
like 200 plants are over to make it

450
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,800
worth their while right so your own

451
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,639
protection just by

452
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:36,078
forcing the numbers up get that pot out

453
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:38,000
there you know

454
00:14:36,078 --> 00:14:40,319
and of course

455
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,839
all right and we're back back to remind

456
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,680

00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,839
can be back in that boat we're talking

495
00:16:01,278 --> 00:16:05,439
about a real economic boom i think you

496
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,360
know the tourist industry is going to

497
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,519
boom the farmers are going to boom

498
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:12,159
there's just tons of economic potential

499
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:15,278
here that we can channel with the oregon

500
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:17,198
cannabis tax act well a lot of good

501
00:16:15,278 --> 00:16:19,039
i think the old-fashioned mom-and-pop

502
00:16:17,198 --> 00:16:20,240
businesses will come out of this and i

503
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:22,559
think it's

504
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,959
you know if we have this regulate here

505
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:27,119
in oregon we can we can have stores we

506
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:28,799
can have cafes and a lot of small

507
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,720
businesses will come out of it that

508
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:32,639
people who don't want to work for the

509
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,800
big corporations or the government

510
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:37,519
whatever can actually get behind this

511
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:39,519
and um and you know making money off at

512

514
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,800
millions of dollars in tax revenue for

515
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:49,198
the state which means less tax dollars

that mark emery tells it like it is and

553
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:17,120
and puts his opinions out there so back

554
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:17,119
to that interview all right

555
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:21,279
you know

556
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:22,480
and of course the americans are always

557
00:18:21,279 --> 00:18:23,918
really good they buy up everything you

558
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,279
know and people say well what happens

559
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:26,480
when everybody's growing pot and we

560
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:28,160
can't get rid of i said it'll never

561
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,400
happen because there's always america

562
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:32,558
and america is a endless appetite for

563
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,720
things that they shouldn't have can't

564
00:18:32,558 --> 00:18:36,480
get or whatever you know america is just

565
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,240
an endless appetite you could never

566
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,000
build enough casinos you could never

567
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,759
have enough drugs for america you could

568
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,119
never have enough marijuana for america

569
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:44,960
you could never have enough french fries

570
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:46,319
for america there's just a lot of things

571
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,798
in america you could never give them

572
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:51,839
enough of so to me america is just one

573
00:18:48,798 --> 00:18:53,918
endless place to put pot it when they'll

574
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:55,199
always have lots of american money you

575
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:56,559
know because pot is a universal

576
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,480
commodity everybody wants it it's

577
00:18:56,558 --> 00:18:59,918
saleable everywhere you know before

578
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,440
prohibition before america made

579
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:02,640
marijuana illegal you know you could get

580
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,798
pot maybe three or four places in the

581
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,160
world india pakistan afghanistan and it

582
00:19:04,798 --> 00:19:07,599
was exported to the world from there for

583
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,519
the few people that wanted it when it

584
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:11,119
was made illegal in canada 1923 there is

585
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:13,279
no known record of everybody ever having

586
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:14,719
smoke pot there no one's ever written

587
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:16,079
about it no one's ever been recorded no

588
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,279
one's made any testimony there's no

589
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:18,720
evidence that it was ever grown here for

590
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:21,038
marijuana it was grown for hemp all over

591
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,880
the place right and but nobody grew up

592
00:19:21,038 --> 00:19:24,798
for pot well then they made it illegal

593
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,720
now grows in every village every hamlet

594
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:28,558
every city every town i know a guy

595
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,400
growing north of the arctic circle in

596
00:19:28,558 --> 00:19:32,639
frosher bay with two thousand watts of

597
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,840
light and he has an rcmp visit every

598
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,799
three months he's got to take it all

599
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:36,159
down

600
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:38,480
the whole growth thing is time

601
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,240
cyclically to match that rcmp visit so i

602
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,599
can take it all down put it away put it

603
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,599
back up when it goes i mean we've got

604
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:46,000
guys growing in the most inhospitable

605
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:47,918
environment on earth as well as every

606
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,599
other country nation province place

607
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:51,440
under their growing pot thanks to

608
00:19:49,599 --> 00:19:53,759
america's prohibition so one thing's for

609
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,679
sure

610
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:57,440
if it well i wouldn't be surprised i

611
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:58,480
mean after all why not that sun there

612
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,200
would be great that'd be an excellent

613
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,960
dude

614
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,160
when the ozone layer is deteriorating

615
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,160
then you put that pot under there

616
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:05,679
because it will thrive and it will of

617
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:07,840
course replace the ozone layer that's

618
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:10,160
lost by adding more carbon dioxide or

619
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:12,000
sorry more oxygen to the environment and

620
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:13,519
giving it you know excellent excellent

621
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,119
thing to grow under when you've got

622
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:16,558
ozone depletions just grow endless

623
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:19,519
amounts of marijuana

624
00:20:16,558 --> 00:20:21,519
and that will begin to reverse the cycle

625
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:23,200
and but now pot grows everywhere every

626
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:25,918
place in the world is pot every street

627
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:27,440
on vancouver has five to 25 grow

628
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:28,480
operations cops will tell you they can

629
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,840
go down the street tell you about every

630
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,440
third one which is a grow up they know

631
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:33,279
they can't even get the time to bust

632
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,480
them right in some rural areas around

633
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:35,519
british columbia they're not even doing

634
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,880
that it's called so listen your

635
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:38,960
landlord's such a grown pot you gotta

636
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,240
have it done by tomorrow i'm coming by

637
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,600
right so that means you gotta rip it all

638
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,798
out take it it comes by okay maybe

639
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:44,399
doesn't come by he calls him says did

640
00:20:42,798 --> 00:20:45,599
you write it down yeah okay

641
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,798
you know because he doesn't really want

642
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:48,558
to bother you but on the other hand he

643
00:20:46,798 --> 00:20:49,359
knows it exists so he's calling you now

644
00:20:48,558 --> 00:20:50,158
of course that's actually

645
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:51,439
unconstitutional because that

646
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:52,720
constitutes a fishing experience you

647
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,600

658
00:21:12,558 --> 00:21:14,879
surprised more that doesn't go on

659
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:17,839
there's a wonderful song by sibling

660
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,960
called oak's crazy fools and it's about

661
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:21,199
putting a bullet in the people that call

662
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,400
9-1-1 to turn us in and i think that's

663
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,159
an interesting thing worth considering

664
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,679
to one degree i said because there's

665
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:27,600
nothing more evil than somebody in the

666
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:29,200
so-called free society who turn you in

667
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:30,879
at the risk of going to jail for five or

668
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,600
ten years over a gardening project you

669
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:35,120
should deal with those people harshly so

670
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:37,759
you know i have certainly no sympathy

671
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:39,759
for informers and people that drop dime

672
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:40,720
you know and cause great untold misery

673
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:42,720
those people should be dealt with

674
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,558
harshly and i certainly advocate

675
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,400
you know a little private vigilante

676
00:21:44,558 --> 00:21:48,240
american cell justice for those people

677
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,280
and you know others involve the drug i'm

678
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,720

fertilizer bombs blowing up fbi

709
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,880
headquarters good idea originally but

710
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:41,918
then there's people and kids there like

711
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,120
what's that what you couldn't have

712
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:44,799
waited till there was a big staff

713
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:47,119
meeting or something you know i mean

714
00:22:44,798 --> 00:22:49,679
what was the problem there i mean stupid

715
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:50,639
you know mass you know justice seekers

716
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:52,000
like that

717
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,000
america needs a training course on how

718
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,440
to properly execute government officials

719
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,359
and you can always edit this later of

720
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,798
course it's just the humorous you know

721
00:22:57,359 --> 00:23:00,399
we might i would say

722
00:22:58,798 --> 00:23:01,759
okay

723
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,120
we're the radical franchise i don't know

724
00:23:01,759 --> 00:23:04,960
it makes you wonder you know you've had

725
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:06,239
helicopters over humboldt county for 20

726
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,360
years and nobody's decided that they

727
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,120
wanted to

728
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:10,959
test out all that surplus they brought

729
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:12,558
back from nan come on well the only time

730
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:15,279
i ever heard of them they were doing a

731
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:17,440
helicopter was in the oregon coast range

732
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:19,678
and it was they were spraying herbicides

733
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:21,440
for the new forest to help the new trees

734
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:23,759
grow up and that was making people sick

735
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:25,200
and also of course they had little grow

736
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:27,200
up in the woods at that time there but

737
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,200
they actually blew up one helicopter on

738
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:31,038
a padded that's not good for them so i'm

739
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,720
not that's good safe professional yeah

740
00:23:31,038 --> 00:23:34,558
nobody dies yeah that's right you know

741
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,839
they did it uh nice and professionally

742
00:23:34,558 --> 00:23:37,038
yeah no see there should be more of that

743
00:23:35,839 --> 00:23:38,480
i don't you know i don't understand what

744
00:23:37,038 --> 00:23:40,079
happened to proper you know green

745
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,240
revolutionaries and they have it like

746
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:43,678
ira you have on one hand political guys

747
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,159
like us advocating in the public and

748
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:47,200
then you have a a bunch of crazed guys

749
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:48,320
who will blow up anything

750
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,840
government-owned that's dealing with

751
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:51,200
that's attacking the marijuana industry

752
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:52,720
and then you know you have them totally

753
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,159
paranoid on one hand you know they could

754
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,759
die at any moment and on the other hand

755
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:57,440
you've got smooth talkers like me trying

756
00:23:55,759 --> 00:23:58,558
to negotiate in the public realm with a

757
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,400
little bit of help from our armed

758
00:23:58,558 --> 00:24:02,158
buddies out there you know

759
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,080
i mean nobody'd be listening to that

760
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:05,919
sheen finn guy now if they weren't like

761
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:08,639
blasting people's kneecaps the last 20

762
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:10,000
years they want to end that right so the

763
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,200
american government understands they're

764
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,480
in a war when they fight back because i

765
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,240
notice you guys lose when you have a

766
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,480
determined opponent

767
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,480
like in vietnam and you know and where

768
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,839
who else has kicked your ass lately you

769
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,038
know it's only you know

770
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:23,519
lately america's been really good on

771
00:24:21,038 --> 00:24:24,879
guys like iraq you know like real

772
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:27,359
only brought into the 20th century about

773
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,880
a decade ago so you know but they lost

774
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:30,399
again you know so i'm thinking i think

775
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,760
in america somebody that could be beaten

776
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,600
because the rot from within is so

777
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:34,720
extensive you know actually i'm just

778

don't forget exactly you know

834
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:36,480
our campaign to date has been almost

835
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:38,798
entirely volunteer but now we are

836
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:40,880
actually paying petitioners so if you

837
00:26:38,798 --> 00:26:44,319
need work or you know someone who needs

838
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,320
work call us at

839
00:26:45,319 --> 00:26:49,599
503-235-4606 we're paying petitioners

840
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:52,880
now however if you want to help us as a

841
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:54,879
volunteer please do paul and i are both

842
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:57,679
volunteers we donate our time and

843
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:59,440
talents and money to help this cause but

844
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:01,840
a lot of people can't do that a lot of

845
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:04,159
people have to be reimbursed for their

846
00:27:01,839 --> 00:27:06,319
expenses and their time so if you need

847
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:09,600
to be a paid petitioner call us right

848
00:27:06,319 --> 00:27:11,839
now at 503-235-4606

849
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:13,599
or if you're a volunteer call us there

850
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:16,480
send it back though send it out well

851
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:18,158
definitely you know we need volunteers

852
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,919
because you know who knows how long

853
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:22,640
before the money well dries up and we

854
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:24,080
can't pay people um you know right now

855
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,000
you know we're fortunate we could pay a

856
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:27,599
few folks however

857
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,759
we still need we're probably going to

858
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:31,678
end up with a majority of our signatures

859
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:33,278
being volunteer that's this is the way

860
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:34,559
it's going to happen and so we need

861
00:27:33,278 --> 00:27:35,839
yours

862
00:27:34,558 --> 00:27:38,000
and don't feel don't think that it's

863
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:39,839
because we're paying a few folks for the

864
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,798
moment we don't need your one or two

865
