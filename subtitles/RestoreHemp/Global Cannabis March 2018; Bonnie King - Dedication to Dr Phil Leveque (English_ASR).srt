1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,650
welcome back to the global cannabis

2
00:00:02,819 --> 00:00:07,849
March this is a really big day for all

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:11,699
of us every year this 19th anniversary

4
00:00:07,849 --> 00:00:14,070
should really be a kickoff for something

5
00:00:11,699 --> 00:00:16,799
great too because cannabis has come so

6
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:21,240
far in the last year let alone last 10

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:23,100
years or 19 years you probably know that

8
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:24,778
there are a lot of people that made this

9
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,060
happen through the years that are not

10
00:00:24,778 --> 00:00:28,050
here today

11
00:00:26,059 --> 00:00:30,839
unfortunately everybody's not been able

12
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:34,590
to see this wonderful thing come to

13
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:36,600
fruition a lot of folks may ask also

14
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:38,520
well what the heck are we doing hey man

15
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:41,160
you know Oregon you guys can smoke weed

16
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,300
why are you even marching that's because

17
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:44,099
they're not from here and they don't

18
00:00:42,299 --> 00:00:45,929
understand the struggle we have been

19
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,300
working tirelessly

20
00:00:45,929 --> 00:00:51,030
I mean seriously since the 80s with

21
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:55,948
people like Paul Stanford Paul Loney

22
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:59,698
and of course dr. Phil Levesque dr.

23
00:00:55,948 --> 00:01:02,608
Levesque passed away three years ago

24
00:00:59,698 --> 00:01:04,588
today on global cannabis today the most

25
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:07,200
perfect day of course for him to decide

26
00:01:04,588 --> 00:01:09,329
to go through another door what he did

27
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,150
for Oregon and for the United States and

28
00:01:09,329 --> 00:01:15,750
for the world is hard to put into any

29
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:18,630
kind of synopsis it truly is he was a

30
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:23,519
brilliant man that absolutely did not

31
00:01:18,629 --> 00:01:25,739
ever ever give up to his dying day when

32
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:27,298
when he was a kid and he graduated from

33
00:01:25,739 --> 00:01:30,269
high school he went to University of

34
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:32,430
Oregon and got a bachelor's in chemistry

35
00:01:30,269 --> 00:01:35,728
and what did he do after that he went

36
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:38,159
and joined the Army in 1944 and became a

37
00:01:35,728 --> 00:01:41,039
scout in the army one of the most

38
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:44,250
dangerous jobs there was so thanks to

39
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:48,229
him and Patton's army crossing the Rhine

40
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:51,269
he was able to secure and liberate

41
00:01:48,228 --> 00:01:53,609
Americans and and people that had been

42
00:01:51,269 --> 00:01:57,599
you know accosted by that terrible war

43
00:01:53,609 --> 00:02:00,180
for years and he came home alive what he

44
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:03,509
also came home with was a terrible bout

45
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:06,479
of PTSD and he couldn't talk about the

46
00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:08,878
war for decades decades not to his kids

47
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:12,568
not to his wife not to anybody when it

48
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:13,560
finally broke free about 30 just over 30

49
00:02:12,568 --> 00:02:16,049
years after

50
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,879
the war then he was able to start

51
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:21,060
reaching out and helping other veterans

52
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:24,419
in Oregon that meant helping veterans

53
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:26,459
get off of narcotics and the terrible

54
00:02:24,419 --> 00:02:30,000
drugs that they were going that they

55
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:31,800
were used using even alcohol in order to

56
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,699
combat the demons that they were

57
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:39,239
suffering from PTSD so doctor Levesque

58
00:02:35,699 --> 00:02:41,459
through his work in Oregon and fighting

59
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:43,310
through with the legislature was one of

60
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:46,560
the guys that made it possible for

61
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:48,629
veterans to have access to the right

62
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:53,310
medicine that would make them healthy

63
00:02:48,629 --> 00:02:55,079
and not kill them so in 1998 doc fought

64
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:58,098
real hard 99 you know that it became

65
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:02,130
legal for medical marijuana patients by

66
00:02:58,098 --> 00:03:05,848
2004 dr. Levesque had five thousand

67
00:03:02,129 --> 00:03:08,340
patients he was the doctor in Oregon had

68
00:03:05,848 --> 00:03:11,068
signed more cards than anybody else so

69
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:13,769
that put him in the spotlight the target

70
00:03:11,068 --> 00:03:15,899
for problems with the authorities

71
00:03:13,769 --> 00:03:17,459
problems with other doctors other

72
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:20,489
doctors that wanted to keep their

73
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:23,069
patients drugged up and under their care

74
00:03:20,489 --> 00:03:26,730
and instead doc was freeing them from

75
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:27,840
the terrible you know drug addictions so

76
00:03:26,729 --> 00:03:30,449
that got him in trouble

77
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,539
in 2005 he actually lost his license to

78
00:03:30,449 --> 00:03:37,349
practice and after that he became even

79
00:03:33,539 --> 00:03:39,150
stronger voice for legalization and for

80
00:03:37,349 --> 00:03:42,060
medical marijuana patients he never

81
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:45,269
stopped one day under any circumstances

82
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:47,609
they beat him down but they never never

83
00:03:45,269 --> 00:03:50,639
got him down and he always came back

84
00:03:47,609 --> 00:03:52,889
stronger than he was so what I would

85
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:57,980
like to do is dedicate today and this

86
00:03:52,889 --> 00:03:57,980
stage again to dr. Phillip Levesque and

87
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:03,020
I know if he was here he'd have a lot

88
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:06,020
more to say about what it means to him

89
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:08,630
to work with all of you guys and you

90
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:11,659
know that really you are his legacy all

91
00:04:08,629 --> 00:04:14,750
of us are and it's up to us to keep this

92
00:04:11,659 --> 00:04:17,540
momentum going stronger we don't need to

93
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:18,709
reschedule we need to descale let's get

94
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:22,370
this thing over with

95
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:23,930
okay so let's do it for doc Levesque and

96
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:25,610
for Jack Kerr and for everybody else

97
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:28,400
that we have lost that were the big

98
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:31,100
fighting warriors we have to be there

99
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:33,889
warriors you guys it's up to us now okay

100
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:36,290

101
00:04:33,889 --> 00:04:39,560
doc and those of you that know him know

102
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:43,819
that his last words would be don't smoke

103
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:46,030
in the rain and if you have to ask don't

104
00:04:43,819 --> 00:04:46,029
ask
