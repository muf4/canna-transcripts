the oil industry magnets such as Andrew

54

55
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:56,199
so uh he is the one who directed

56
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:58,840
actually the first marijuana laws in the

57
00:02:56,199 --> 00:03:02,598
country were enacted in 1914 right about

58
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:04,479
the time this uh 20 this $10 bill was

59
00:03:02,598 --> 00:03:07,878
made now this

60
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:11,318
$10 uh Federal Reserve Note is printed

61
00:03:07,878 --> 00:03:13,239

62
00:03:11,318 --> 00:03:15,679

00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:24,759
this thing over you can't this shows

67
00:03:21,878 --> 00:03:27,359
what's on the back we see Industries

68
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:30,679
which are really important but even more

69
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,840
important we see them harvesting hemp

70
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:37,040
see those those are hemp bundles on the

71
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:39,400
ground and they yeah they so as Don

72
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:42,000
skaki pointed out a couple of weeks ago

73
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:44,120
it's right there on the money uh

74
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,680
Industrial Hemp not only is this made

75
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:50,719
out of hemp fiber it is uh shows hemp

76
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:52,438
harvesting on the back of it so this

77
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:55,000
bill in particular has a lot of

78
00:03:52,438 --> 00:03:56,959
historical one of beautiful bills done

79
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,239
too I think the artwork is just stunning

80
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:01,280
yeah yeah and so uh there it is it's

81
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:04,640
right right on the money as you can see

82
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:06,318
get that L enlarged on your uh your HD

83
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:08,279
screens at home and then they March into

84
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:10,518
Congress and make all these silly laws

85
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:13,039
so yeah so this bill is is particularly

86
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:14,438
uh historic in that regard it's a great

87
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:16,039
teaching tool that's why I decided to

88
00:04:14,438 --> 00:04:18,519
bring it back and talk about those

89
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:21,280
various aspects of hemp and cannabis

90
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:21,280
prohibition
