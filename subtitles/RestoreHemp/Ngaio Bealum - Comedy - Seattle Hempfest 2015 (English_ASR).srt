00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:11,789

conservation of lighters

00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:12,089
lighters are kinda created or destroyed

113
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:19,470

fantastic we've been friends long enough

128
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:50,279
I think you're ready the first

129
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:51,780
ingredient is love listen I know it

130
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:52,979
sounds corny man but people don't say it

131
00:05:51,779 --> 00:05:54,119
enough and everybody acts like it

132
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:55,560
doesn't matter if you don't start with

133
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,910
love is then we're gonna taste right so

134

135
00:05:56,910 --> 00:06:01,710
with love and then it's 2 cups of apples

136
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,240
I recommend a cross or a mix of the Fuji

137
00:06:01,709 --> 00:06:04,949
and the pink lady the Fuji comes from

138
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,509
Japan which is interesting it's one of

139
00:06:04,949 --> 00:06:08,009
the older variations that started in

140
00:06:06,509 --> 00:06:09,870
Kazakhstan which is the birthplace of

141
00:06:08,009 --> 00:06:11,430
all apples I was in Kazakh saying one

142
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:13,769

143
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:16,050
Silk Road on my Vision Quest it was

144
00:06:13,769 --> 00:06:17,819
there in this little Hut then I met this

145
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:20,220
cat I think he was like a leader or

146
00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:23,189
auger or whatever but he had this hatch

147
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:24,960
it was all brown and crumbly delicious

148
00:06:23,189 --> 00:06:30,930
and kind of spicy it smelled like

149
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:33,089
cinnamon it's 2 teaspoons of cinnamon he

150
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:35,430
just went on and on for days and days

151
00:06:33,089 --> 00:06:37,019

psilocybin mescaline and we hybridize

157
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:50,009

158
00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:53,039

165
00:07:05,269 --> 00:07:10,490
best pie I've ever had in my life

166
00:07:06,668 --> 00:07:12,668
because I was finally ready for it right

167
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:15,620
my tree had grown

168
00:07:12,668 --> 00:07:18,620
I'm glad you stoners could hang on for

169
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:20,899
the internet story I know it gets hard

170
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:26,538
out there sometimes wait what how much

171
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:28,038
cinnamon I'm a good cook though I love

172
00:07:26,538 --> 00:07:30,168

173
00:07:28,038 --> 00:07:31,819
right cuz I don't have a lot of money so

174
00:07:30,168 --> 00:07:33,529
I will invent some [ __ ] to eat you

175
00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:34,038

peanut butter

177
00:07:34,038 --> 00:07:37,519

178
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:39,560
10 to 12 minutes you know what I'm

179
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:41,899

[ __ ] it up it's not a savory dish I'm

185
00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:59,240
glad you guys know what top ramen is

186
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:02,030

187
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:05,410
crowd and bail blue or so she ought to

188

202
00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:17,880
an anti-inflammatory it keeps me from

203
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:19,708
flaming on people I love weed I smoke

204
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:20,429

205
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:21,929

207
00:09:21,929 --> 00:09:25,439

208
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:27,120
high and then do something that's always

209
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,290
not like you get high and go to him

210
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,060
fester you get high and tell some jokes

211

216
00:09:37,589 --> 00:09:40,470

217
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,740
tiny Vegas you could do pretty much

218
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:45,300
whatever you want this no one ever said

219
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:47,250
even in states where weed is illegal no

220
00:09:45,299 --> 00:09:49,319

221
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:50,759
incessant use of marijuana whilst all

222
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,600

223
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:53,429
what would they say they're gonna go

224
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,250
