small the i can feel the i can feel that

35
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,079
the dedication to seeing

36
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:23,359
laws change

37
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:26,079
on a variety of subjects which includes

38
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:29,519
marijuana in the case of this group here

39
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:29,519
that i'm associated with today

40
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,920
kentucky was the world's largest

41
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,840
producer of him for over 100 years it

42
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,439
was our largest cash crop for for more

43
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,478
than a century

44
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:41,199
and

45
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:42,879
imagine that a state whose largest cash

46
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,920
crop was hemp

47
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:46,078
and

48
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,799
i'm sure that the the smoking aspect of

49
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:51,039
it was uh you know was also well

50
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,840
represented

51
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:57,200
people

52
00:01:52,840 --> 00:02:01,600
uh course in the early 1900s it uh

53
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,600
went down and they legalized it in 37.

54
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:07,680
kentucky should be the place where

55
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:09,840
cannabis is returned as a gas crop in

56
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,360
the state of kentucky and i started out

57
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,719
a long time ago to try to make that a

58
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,200
reality

59
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:19,039
i'm a fourth generation kentuckian

60
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:21,679
i was 24 years old in a milkman in 1971

61
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:24,400
when i decided i was grist for the mill

62
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,239
uh i was ending up in prison or in jail

63
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,000
or dead at an early age

64
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:30,000
so i decided that

65
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,800
i better learn the system

66
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,719
so

67
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,920
or i was just going to be a victim of it

68
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:36,400
so i decided i was going to go to

69
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:37,839
college to become an attorney

70
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,280
and while i was added if i was going to

71
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,439
put that much into it i might as well

72
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,680
become governor and change the marijuana

73
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:45,039
laws in the state of kentucky and quit

74
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,080
treating our people like we're in

75
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:49,598
occupied territory

76
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,480
and take the government

77
00:02:49,598 --> 00:02:53,839
out of the uh the helicopters uh out of

78
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:55,359
the air that are hovering over the

79
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,439
fields and gardens of the people's state

80
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,280
of kentucky and put marijuana into the

81
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:01,359
hands as many sick and dying people in

82
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,039
the state as i possibly could

83
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,480
and that's what i started out to do 40

84
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:06,158
years ago and i've gotten up every day

85
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:07,598
since that time to do that

86
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:09,679
i've run for office in the state of

87
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:12,158
kentucky on several occasions this is my

88
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,920
fifth time for governor i've also run

89
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:16,079
for a

90
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:18,399
agricultural commissioner attorney

91
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,000
general in congress twice

92
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,400
i've posed some mighty impressive

93
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,719
numbers i won't bore you with them all

94
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,360
but let me tell you that this time we is

95
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:29,199
the very best chance that i've ever had

96
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,519
to actually win

97
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:33,359
the governor of the state of kentucky

98
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,158
let me tell you what that would do to

99
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,159
the

100
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:37,439
political landscape in the united states

101
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:39,439
of america

102
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:41,840
that would be phenomenal

103
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:44,000
there was an independent uh elected for

104
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,878
the first time in 150 years in rhode

105
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,080
island

106
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:50,479
last last political season but he had

107
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,680
been a state a u.s state senator out of

108
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:54,000
that

109
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,640
out of that state so he already had a

110
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,479
statewide basis to go independent with

111
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:00,000
my running mate and i are totally

112
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:01,280
independent no party affiliation

113
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,598
whatsoever

114
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,919
i've got a lady running mate the name d

115
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:08,719
riley who's phenomenal

116
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:11,039
the mother of six two adopted one of her

117
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:13,199
natural children has special needs she

118
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:15,919
knows whether the the

119
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:17,918
politics hit the road about policies for

120
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:20,798
women and children in the state

121
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:22,319
and she smartest attack and we need more

122
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:23,599
women in leadership roles in the state

123
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:26,399
of kentucky

124
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,080
uh i am running this time this is what i

125
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:29,439
say they say galbraith you're a

126
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:31,839
perennial candidate that's what

127
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:33,839
kentucky's got perennial problems

128
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:35,279
that the people in kentucky did they

129
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:37,599
would beat me and actually fix the

130
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:39,039
problems i wouldn't had to run again

131
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,240
but they didn't and they have it and

132
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,000
they can't

133
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,000
because neither party could produce a

134
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,439
candidate can disengagement partisanship

135
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,839
long enough to work the other side to

136
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:49,759
get the job done

137
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:51,359
and the leadership of the parties in

138
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,639
both the major parties state of kentucky

139
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,160
had the horns locked up like two

140
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,840
bulldogs fighting over territory while

141
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,520
the business of people lays dead in the

142
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:59,758
dust

143
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:02,000
so by running right now i say that only

144
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,520
an independent who doesn't care who gets

145
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,439
credit for doing what's right for the

146
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:07,120
people of the state of kentucky

147
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:09,120
stand the best chance of untying that

148
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,918
gordian knot and letting both parties

149
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,840
operate in the fashion that a lot of the

150
00:05:11,918 --> 00:05:16,079
well-intentioned membership really want

151
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:17,599
to want to work

152
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:19,199
the beauty of it is we're not looking to

153
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,039
replace either party we're not looking

154
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,400
to throw the rascals out

155
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:24,478
we're not looking for you to vote

156
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:26,239
against your you know your

157
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:27,918
representative or senator

158
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,600
and we don't want you to renounce your

159
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:31,038
family's party

160
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,639
we're not asking you to do that we're

161
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:34,319
not asking you to vote for the dreaded

162
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,360
other party

163
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:37,519
we're asking you to vote for an

164
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,400
independent who wants to work with you

165
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:41,918
to try to get the job done

166
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:44,638
and so

167
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:46,478
i've offered myself again this time and

168
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,000
the difference is there are several

169
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:50,800
things

170
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,000
first of all is that everybody's sick

171
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:56,160
and tired of the gridlock in kentucky as

172
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,038
they say i can accuse kentucky of being

173
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,720
the victim of electile dysfunction

174
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:01,839
they they just can't seem to get it

175
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,360
right

176
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:05,519
and so

177
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,360
what we think is that

178
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:10,560
we know for a fact

179
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:13,439
that we're already climbing in the polls

180
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,800
i thought i said the last time uh

181
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:16,800
they they

182
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,160
told us about about six months ago with

183
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,319
five percent and they said what'd you

184
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:23,919
think i said that's great with me i

185
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:25,199
believe we'll be 10 by may and 15 to 20

186
00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:27,758
by september

187
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:29,840
we were at 13 in april

188
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,280
so you know we're moving on up we're

189
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:33,038
really not spending any money we don't

190
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:34,638
have to spend

191
00:06:33,038 --> 00:06:36,560
but i've never spent more than twenty

192
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:41,038
thousand dollars on any campaign in the

193
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:43,199
past we've spent 140 000 on this so far

194
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:46,318
uh you know

195
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:48,639
uh 90 000 is my money

196
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,400
i practice law for a living i live i

197
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:53,519
live feed fee

198
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:55,519
uh but i've smelled it this time

199
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:57,519
i smell it this time

200
00:06:55,519 --> 00:07:00,159
that people are sick and tired of it i

201
00:06:57,519 --> 00:07:02,639
got endorsed by union the other day and

202
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,919
i said why uh you know why did you folks

203
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,160
endorse me and he said because you've

204
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:07,680
never lied to his gatewood and i said

205
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,360
well hell if i was gonna lie to you i'd

206
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,038
already been elected

207
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,879
you know and

208
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:15,120
people are understanding that

209
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:17,598
and people are clueing into that

210
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,120
so uh what does an election for gatewood

211
00:07:17,598 --> 00:07:21,120
galbraith in kentucky mean for the

212
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,280
people of the city of portland and the

213
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,720
city people of oregon i'll tell you what

214
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:27,439
it means

215
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,039
for the first time in my memory

216
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:30,719
that i've ever heard

217
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:32,800
the people of america are going to have

218
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,720
a champion who believes it

219
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:38,160
when the founding fathers conferred

220
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:40,560
sovereignty on us as human beings

221
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,400
when they said that every every human

222
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,680
being is endowed by their creator with

223
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:47,679
life liberty and the pursuit of

224
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,400
happiness certain inalienable rights

225
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,519
and

226
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:53,279
for the first time to think about that

227
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:55,680
before the american revolution came back

228
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:58,000
we were all property

229
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,000
we belong to the local king or queen to

230
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,918
the local warlord whoever possessed the

231
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,839
most gun powder in the valley

232
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:05,598
you didn't have any inalienable rights

233
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:07,119
people didn't have any inalienable

234
00:08:05,598 --> 00:08:09,038
rights

235
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,038
if the ruler said hey come in here off

236
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:14,079
with their head there you went there was

237
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:17,038
nobody to intercede on your behalf

238
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:19,839
but the founding fathers

239
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:22,079
took humankind out of the category of

240
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:26,079
property and conferred on them the

241
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:28,639
concept of sovereign human beings

242
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:31,279
self-determinative

243
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:33,278
individualized

244
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:34,879
worst something individually and

245
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:38,240
something that the government couldn't

246
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:40,639
take away or mess with

247
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,680
and they wrote a constitution

248
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:42,958
the

249
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:44,639
declaration of independence didn't

250
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:46,879
become law but the constitution they

251
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:48,879
fashioned to try to

252
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:50,480
immortalize that it was it was their

253
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:53,039
attempt to write a set of laws that was

254
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:55,120
going to keep that project in mind

255
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:57,039
so it was a human revolution that

256
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,240
conference of sovereignty on the

257
00:08:57,039 --> 00:09:00,480
individual

258
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,320
and then they turned us loose

259
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,920
and with that kind of freedom we've come

260
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,600
to america and that's the way that was

261
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:07,599
supposed to have started out and what

262
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,360
we've been trying to keep up

263
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,839
but that concept of individual

264
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,519
sovereignty is under great pressure

265
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:16,720
today

266
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:19,120
and the current generation is facing the

267
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:21,519
greatest threat of all of having the

268
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,679
bill of rights just flat drawn out from

269
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:26,159
underneath us

270
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:29,359
in the in the nanny state thought line

271
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:32,559
of protecting us from ourselves

272
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:35,519
but what it is is uh is a

273
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:36,479
is a absolute assault on the

274
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,039
on the

275
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:42,879
privileges of sovereign human beings and

276
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:45,120
sovereign citizens of the constitution

277
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:46,799
so the uh the right to life liberty and

278
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,799
pursuit of happiness is not a law

279
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:50,719
because it is not in the constitution

280
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:52,479
but in the state of kentucky

281
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,000
the very first section of the

282
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,480
constitution of the state of kentucky

283
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,399
says that we're all

284
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,879
possessed of inadequate right to life

285
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:03,360
liberty pursuit of happiness

286
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:05,519
so i'm going to reconstruct kentucky's

287
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,680
policy in kentucky's government around

288
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:09,200
that thesis

289
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:11,838
and we're going to rediscover whether

290
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,120
america still has a pulse

291
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,040
we're going to try to become the

292
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,320
template of what freedom of the

293
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:17,838
individual means in the state of

294
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,839
kentucky

295
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:21,279
i believe we'll become a tourist to

296
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:23,360
mecca

297
00:10:21,278 --> 00:10:24,480
i believe that people will come in from

298
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,560
all around

299
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,959
the the country and the globe to see

300
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:30,559
what it likes to live free

301
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:32,799
and i'm not talking about riots in the

302
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:34,078
streets i'm not talking about

303
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:35,599
you know

304
00:10:34,078 --> 00:10:37,439
people

305
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,159
causing uh to mult

306
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,399
out in public i don't see that happening

307
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:44,240
i just think that the idea that we're

308
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:46,799
attempting it is going to bring in the

309
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,879
right-minded people

310
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:50,639
but we're going to try to spread it out

311
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:52,240
we're going to try to rediscover the

312
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:54,319
american revolution

313
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:57,440
and we're going to do that by

314
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:59,440
putting the processes and the surpluses

315
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,920
of that form of government out to the

316
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,519
people instead of special interests

317
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:04,799
i know who those special interests are

318
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,320
and i'm going to put a stop to it and

319
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:08,559
the savings we're going to put back into

320
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,320
the hands of the people

321
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:12,958
so

322
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:16,079
i

323
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:18,239
i tell you a couple of plans that i i

324
00:11:16,078 --> 00:11:19,759
have for the state of kentucky

325
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,600
uh i appreciate if i get that

326
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:23,679
opportunity i'm standing up here with a

327
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,879
couple of uh a couple of movers and

328
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:26,000
shakers in

329
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:27,439
the uh

330
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,839
in

331
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:32,399
the prospect of medical marijuana and

332
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:34,160
marijuana people i said early on that i

333
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:36,078
wanted to

334
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:37,679
make marijuana legal but i don't want to

335
00:11:36,078 --> 00:11:39,359
make marijuana legal because

336
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:41,039
eight-year-olds can stand on the street

337
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,399
corner and eat a demate and that's legal

338
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:44,159
i don't want that

339
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,159
i want some sort of uh people ought to

340
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:47,759
be able to grow their own uh and be

341
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:49,919
regulated by families if there's any

342
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:51,919
problem with it bringing social services

343
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:54,000
instead of the cops

344
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:56,719
you know if uh and only that under

345
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,399
probable cause

346
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,079
but

347
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:02,159
if it's going to be commerce in it the

348
00:12:00,078 --> 00:12:03,278
government has right to license and or

349
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:04,719
tax

350
00:12:03,278 --> 00:12:06,240
they just have that right i mean that's

351
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,399
commerce

352
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,159
they do the same thing with widgets

353
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,039
so you know but i want that money i

354
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:13,278
don't want it going over to the

355
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:15,519
corporations i don't want friday night

356
00:12:13,278 --> 00:12:17,120

i don't want clearance sales i don't

358
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:23,039
want any advertising encouraging its use

359
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:24,479
that's not what we're out here for

360
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:26,078
you know at the same time i'd like to

361
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,440
see the money that's generated back go

362
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:28,719
back to the dealers the people who are

363
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,079
dealing now

364
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,440
they're some of the best minds of this

365
00:12:30,078 --> 00:12:32,879
generation they're running a billion

366
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,000
dollar business without a shred of

367
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:35,919
paperwork

368
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,679
you know i think that they ought to

369
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:39,439
they get out of stay in hands as people

370
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:40,319
are putting it out now

371
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,360
but

372
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:46,000
i'm also going to uh put it in the hands

373
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:48,079
of all the sick and dying kentuckians

374
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,759
i want to take it out the hands of the

375
00:12:48,078 --> 00:12:52,239
teenagers and put it over to the hands

376
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:54,159
of the people in the old age homes i

377
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,440
mean it would put a smile on their face

378
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:57,039
it would increase their appetite and

379
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:00,000
think about the increased visitation by

380
00:12:57,039 --> 00:13:02,319
the young folks hey let's go see dad

381
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,759
you know the uh

382
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,680
want to uh

383
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:07,120
i want to educate the people the kids in

384
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:09,759
the state of kentucky and i have plans

385
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,759
for doing that

386
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,279
i'm out here

387
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:18,479
to see if i can raise any money

388
00:13:15,278 --> 00:13:21,200
it i am a criminal defense attorney

389
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:23,278
i can also for hire

390
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,680
uh any lottery winners out there who

391
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:26,720
need a little consultation

392
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:28,799
um

393
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,639
there is no limit there is a limit not a

394
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:31,759
thousand dollar contribution in my race

395
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:33,360
for governor

396
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:35,759
but there is no limit on the government

397
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,120
on an attorney's fee

398
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:38,399
so uh

399
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,679
anybody who needs any special

400
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:43,278
consultation i'm the man to do it with

401
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:44,319
um

402
00:13:43,278 --> 00:13:46,000
money is probably going to be the

403
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,160
biggest issue in this race we probably

404
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,879
need to raise about a half million bucks

405
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:53,120
we're at 140 000 right now as our

406
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:54,958
numbers begin to climb i think the money

407
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,078
will start to come in

408
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:58,638
but

409
00:13:56,078 --> 00:13:59,679
this early money is the most important

410
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:03,839
so

411
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:05,519
i've got the envelopes down here

412
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:07,440
that

413
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:09,039
if you want to make a contribution you

414
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,639
can take this envelope and fill it out

415
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:12,799
and either mail it to us or give it back

416

who

423
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,320
i had some people complained about a

424
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:31,518
woman as a running mate and i said

425
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,519

00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:44,239
and then i have this with me this

431
00:14:41,198 --> 00:14:46,159
evening this is my autobiography

432
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:49,198
it's called the last free man in america

433
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:50,799
meets the synthetic subversion

434
00:14:49,198 --> 00:14:52,958
it is the story

435
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:55,359
of uh

436
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:57,439
40 years of work on my behalf

437
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,360
to try to find out just what went wrong

438
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,600
with america

439
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,519
what went wrong with with the concept of

440
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,959
individual sovereignty

441
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:07,198
and the name of the book is the last

442
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:09,119
free man in america meets the synthetic

443
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:10,838
subversion

444
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,600
and that's what went

445
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:15,760
wrong that uh that we were an agrarian

446
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,680
society we produced it all from the land

447
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:20,159
we discovered the plant that was the

448
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:22,638
answer to all our most basic needs

449
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:24,879
probably fuel medicine and food

450
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,560
and then they discovered petroleum

451
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:28,240
and they discovered all the synthetic

452
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:30,559
processes that could be

453
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,839
done to extract the products from

454
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:33,518
petroleum

455
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:35,519
and they decided to take the farmer out

456
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:37,440
of competition with them

457
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:41,198
not only in the petrochemical but the

458
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:42,959
pharmaceutical and medicinal aspect

459
00:15:41,198 --> 00:15:45,439
and so now a great number of our

460
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:46,958
problems uh dealt with because both the

461
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,480
major parties that were set up to

462
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:50,638
protect us

463
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,159
both on a national and local level

464
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:53,440
had been bought off with a special

465
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:56,159
interest money

466
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,839
extraordinary special interest money

467
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:59,319
from the people that i call the

468
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,199
petrochemical pharmaceutical

469
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:05,440
military-industrial transnational

470
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:05,439
corporate fascist elite son of a

471
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:08,639
the ones who have never said the pledge

472
00:16:07,278 --> 00:16:10,078
of allegiance to the flag the united

473
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:11,600
states of america are to the republic

474
00:16:10,078 --> 00:16:13,198
for which it stands

475
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,879
and the ones who view the constitution

476
00:16:13,198 --> 00:16:16,639
and the bill of rights as impediments to

477
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:19,679
the implementation of a new world order

478
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:21,278
and global economy

479
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:22,879
and that's just where it's at these

480
00:16:21,278 --> 00:16:24,159
people have bought off the people were

481
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:26,480
supposed to be protecting us they're

482
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:29,039
trying to dismantle the constitution and

483
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:31,759
our rights just as fast as they can

484
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:33,278
well they've ran into a hard road hole

485
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:34,959
in the state of kentucky and i get to be

486
00:16:33,278 --> 00:16:37,039
governor

487
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:39,198
i recognize them for who they are

488
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:41,360
them guys

489
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:43,919
and i ain't gonna let them guys

490
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,360
take over and make a mockery out of the

491
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:47,039
sacrifices

492
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,240
of all the

493
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:49,759
dads

494
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,839
and granddads

495
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,800
who hit the beaches at normandy in iwo

496
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,560
jima

497
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:57,919
so that you wouldn't have to be in a cup

498
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:59,838
to hold a job in america

499
00:16:57,919 --> 00:17:02,799
so we're going to rediscover

500
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:04,720
whether people in fact those people died

501
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:06,558
in vain

502
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,919
every generation mystery win its own

503
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:09,279
freedoms that's what it says here in

504
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:10,640
this little cloud on the front of the

505
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:12,959
book

506
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:15,280
you know all the sacrifices that anybody

507
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:18,558
in the past up until the last second of

508
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:19,918
my talking to you don't count anymore

509
00:17:18,558 --> 00:17:21,678
it's what you're willing to do from this

510
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:23,038
second forward that's going to decide

511
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:25,519
whether we still have any freedoms to

512
00:17:23,038 --> 00:17:25,519
america

513
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:29,279
the reason i became a champion of

514
00:17:27,038 --> 00:17:31,119
marijuana is because i was asthmatic all

515
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:32,399
my life

516
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:34,959
and uh

517
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,080
i was uh in and out hospital on many

518
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,400
occasions

519
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:40,319
i was fourth for the army

520
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,160
i made the marines take me by getting a

521
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:42,879
couple of doctors to say i had outgrown

522
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,360
it

523
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:47,200
i was on paris island for six weeks

524
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:48,639
and somebody pitched some dust in my

525
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,640
face and i went into

526
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:52,480
asthmatic attack i was discharged

527
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,160
parasite in the marines

528
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,400
i was 19 years old i didn't know

529
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,080
marijuana cured asthma

530
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,640
a friend of mine came back from bangkok

531
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:02,639
thailand with some thai weed and said

532
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,960
gateway try this and i said isn't that

533
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,880
dangerous he says it'll help you

534
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,720
he had to became a doctor so i trusted

535
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,679
him i smoked where i wanted the first

536
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,720
time

537
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:15,038
just like that it cured my asthma

538
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,240
just like that

539
00:18:15,038 --> 00:18:18,400
for someone who's gone through a

540
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,400
lifetime of 21 years

541
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,080
being totally afraid

542
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,080
that at any moment their lungs are going

543
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:27,678
to close up on them let me tell you that

544
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:31,038
creates a lot of free floating anxiety

545
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:32,880
and you know a lot of fear

546
00:18:31,038 --> 00:18:35,440
marijuana cured it

547
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,440
just like that

548
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:40,640
because i tell you what

549
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:42,400
marijuana is a gateway drug

550
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:45,400
marijuana is the gateway to

551
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,400
existentialism

552
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:49,918
when you discover there is more than one

553
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:49,918
reality

554
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,480
when you discover that there is no just

555
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:57,839
one way of looking at things there are

556
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,839
things called perspectives

557
00:18:58,319 --> 00:19:01,839
when you discover that you have the

558
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:03,759
widest range of choices you ever

559
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:05,119
imagined you had because you now

560
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:08,079
understand there's a second way of

561
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:08,079
looking at everything

562
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,079
you just doubled or tripled or

563
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,480
quadrupled the way you can look at

564
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:14,480
things

565
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,759
it's damned entertaining trying to

566
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:20,399
figure out which one has anything to do

567
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:22,480
with reality

568
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:25,759
that's what makes it such a wonderful

569
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:27,839
thing it just alters your perspective

570
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:29,839
so just getting up and going looking out

571
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:32,240
the window getting off the couch so just

572
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:32,240
thinking

573
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:37,759
but when i discovered it cured my asthma

574
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:40,319
what could i do

575
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:43,839
i couldn't shut up about it

576
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:47,200
so i became its champion and i still am

577
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:50,079
and i can't tell you just how how

578
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,279

uh but i am uh

602
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:46,480
looking into the camera and i know that

603
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:49,279
it's going this is going to be played in

604
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,880
places other than this theater

605
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:52,399
so

606
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,640
let me tell you a story

607
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:57,679
i was running for governor in 1990 i had

608
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:59,679
700 on me my wife was divorcing me i was

609
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:01,919
pretty well bankrupt but i wasn't going

610
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:04,960
to give up on the governor's end of it

611
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:06,400
so i went out and rented a tv camera and

612
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:09,200
chaired i sat in the camera and looked

613
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:11,519
into the camera and gave who i was what

614
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:14,000
i was doing then i paid them another 400

615
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:16,639
dollars to send it up on satellite no

616
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
particular time nothing two days later

617
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,520
i'm coming back to my law office and

618
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,679
there's a note on the door and says

619
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:23,679
gatewood call your ex-wife willie nelson

620
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:26,400
is trying to get a hold of you

621
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:28,240
and so i called my ex-wife because my

622
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:31,120
phones had been cut off

623
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,798
and so she said yeah willie was driving

624
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:34,879
down the road on his bus surfing the

625
00:21:32,798 --> 00:21:36,158
channels he caught the whole 30 minutes

626
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,840
of you looking into the camera and

627
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:40,240
talking about what you were doing and he

628
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:42,720
says he wants to help

629
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,960
and so uh yeah really i called willie

630
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,120
and we got together and there's a whole

631
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,480
story about how that happened but that's

632
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:51,759
pretty good start

633
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:53,440
but the fact is that you can never tell

634
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:55,119
how far

635
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:57,120
your voice is going to carry and who's

636
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:58,719
going to be watching this

637
00:21:57,119 --> 00:22:01,038
so i'm telling you

638
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,798
that if you want to advance

639
00:22:01,038 --> 00:22:04,400
freedom and individual freedom and

640
00:22:02,798 --> 00:22:05,918
attempt to find out whether america

641
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,159
still has a voice

642
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:09,600
the gateway galbraith d riley campaign

643
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:11,200
for governor state of kentucky is the

644
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:13,439
one to get into

645
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,840
and we figure we need about a half

646
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,038
million we've raised about 150 000 thus

647
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:19,359
far

648
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:20,400
we can always use uh always use a big

649
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:22,158
dog

650
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,320
it's time some big dogs got involved in

651
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:26,240
this we're willing to advance

652
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:28,639
the idea of america more than anybody

653
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:32,000
