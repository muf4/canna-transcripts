[Applause]

2
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:06,639
it is time for those of us who smoke

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:10,519
marijuana to Get Up Stand Up light up

4
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:10,519
and let the world know how we

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,439
feel we must we must come out of the

6
00:00:15,278 --> 00:00:20,480
closet now it's true by the way that

7
00:00:18,439 --> 00:00:22,839
marijuana smoking increases your

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,320
appreciation for good food for good

9
00:00:22,839 --> 00:00:27,679
music and for good sex and those are not

10
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,679
bad

11
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,640
goals but it does more than that those

12
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:36,960
go goals are quite worth pursuing but

13
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:39,239
for millions of us it enhances our life

14
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,200
it allows us to stand back a step to be

15
00:00:39,238 --> 00:00:43,119
a little detached to to view our

16
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,879
personal life to view our professional

17
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:48,280
life therefore tens of millions of

18
00:00:45,878 --> 00:00:50,439
Americans smoking marijuana can be a

19
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:52,920
positive enriching experience and we

20
00:00:50,439 --> 00:00:55,280
must develop the courage to say that

21
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:58,800
publicly Amen

22
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,799
brother just as gays and lesbians failed

23
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:02,959
to win their rights in this country

24
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:05,158
until large numbers of courageous

25
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,478
individuals were willing to come out of

26
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:10,719
the closet that's what has to happen

27
00:01:07,478 --> 00:01:12,599
with us number one you must vote if you

28
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:15,118
don't vote you're part of the problem

29
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:17,519
number two when you vote it's important

30
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:20,519
to let your elected official know how

31
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:23,599
important this issue is to you and

32
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:25,798
finally you must take a pledge that you

33
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:27,478
will never again vote for a candidate

34
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:30,600
for public office that wants to treat

35
00:01:27,478 --> 00:01:32,640
you like a criminal there were 20 6

36
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:34,879
million Americans smoked marijuana just

37
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,560
in the last year if we all took the

38
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:38,438
pledge to never again vote for a

39
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:41,040
candidate unless they were willing to

40
00:01:38,438 --> 00:01:43,078
support our freedom we'll in marijuana
