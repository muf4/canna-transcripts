1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,250
thanks God well Mexico from Monday CBD

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:12,120
is legal in Mexico it's a big turnaround

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:13,859
we've had some people call it a war it's

4
00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:16,079
just been very crazy the situation

5
00:00:13,859 --> 00:00:17,399
what's going on but thanks to all the

6
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:20,129
movement that's happened I guess

7
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:23,250
worldwide the advancements in cvd

8
00:00:20,129 --> 00:00:27,629
industrial have Mexico now as of Monday

9
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:30,028
we'll have legal cvd that would probably

10
00:00:27,629 --> 00:00:33,750
be cut we'll probably put an end to this

11
00:00:30,028 --> 00:00:35,488
drug war that we've been seen also we

12
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:38,399
were starting to work with hempcrete in

13
00:00:35,488 --> 00:00:41,128
Mexico the advantage of this is building

14
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,750
in Mexico is actually quite cheap so

15
00:00:41,128 --> 00:00:45,329
even though now we have to import a

16
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:48,450
material from Europe the costs of this

17
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:51,239
are dramatically though we can provide

18
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:53,579
houses for a lot of people this is kind

19
00:00:51,238 --> 00:00:56,339
of our return to nature and can provide

20
00:00:53,579 --> 00:01:00,149
us a lot of solutions and housing is one

21
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:02,160
of our basic necessities so going back

22
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:04,500
to nature not only him can provide us

23
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:07,349
that there's other plants like bamboo

24
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:09,750
there's coconuts if we start utilizing

25
00:01:07,349 --> 00:01:13,408
these plants we can start seeing

26
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:14,790
solutions basically to bring up more

27
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:17,100
culture or more education more

28
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:18,920
infrastructure this will stop all this

29
00:01:17,099 --> 00:01:21,658
violence that we're starting to see I

30
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:24,090
guess from all this we've always been

31
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:27,210
neighbors Mexico in the u.s. is pretty

32
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:29,670
much the same thing and for a while I

33
00:01:27,209 --> 00:01:31,739
guess there was that bad weed but

34
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:34,680
nowadays we have very good growers in

35
00:01:31,739 --> 00:01:37,438
Mexico it's very much underground still

36
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:39,150
you cannot be very public and but the

37
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:41,250
good thing is like Mexico laws are just

38
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:43,890
suggestions so we don't have this very

39
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:46,769
harsh penalties for if they catch you

40
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:48,719
with 60 plugs unfortunately if you

41
00:01:46,769 --> 00:01:51,239
cannot pay the cops you cannot get away

42
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:54,030
it's we're going I guess the underground

43
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:55,039
route but nowadays you see small

44
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:57,620
associations

45
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:01,340
bring up a lot of people are growing for

46
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:05,030
people making RSO through this CBD now

47
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:07,430
is legal because I guess through the law

48
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:09,770
structure then you can defend yourself

49
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:11,569
for a constitutional right it's against

50
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:14,480
your constitutional or you're human

51
00:02:11,569 --> 00:02:16,849
right to deny you your medicine and for

52
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:19,009
a little girl that she has 400 and Phil

53
00:02:16,849 --> 00:02:22,969
epic attacks a day very similar to

54
00:02:19,009 --> 00:02:26,090
Charlotte the judge just allowed her the

55
00:02:22,969 --> 00:02:28,699
permit to legally import CBD so as we're

56
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:31,610
saying on Monday medicinal marijuana is

57
00:02:28,699 --> 00:02:34,399
legal in Mexico and this is a doorway to

58
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:35,870
start getting more people on it against

59
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,090
what's happening in feeling the whole

60
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:41,240
movement of grow your own ultimate evil

61
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:44,000
it's becoming very big because if you're

62
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:45,950
gonna grow your own medicine grow your

63
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,199
own food grow your own beer grow your

64
00:02:45,949 --> 00:02:49,488
own house grow your own energy grow your

65
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:56,839
own everything you don't liberate

66
00:02:49,489 --> 00:02:59,330
yourself from very cool well I guess we

67
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:01,939
we get into cannabis because in Mexico

68
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:04,550
we've always been marijuana's it's been

69
00:03:01,939 --> 00:03:06,019
our culture and half of my family comes

70
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:08,450
from Mexico but the other half comes

71
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:11,150
from st. Vincent and they were always

72
00:03:08,449 --> 00:03:12,679
like as a little survivors people called

73
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:15,170
slaves what we call them survivors and

74
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:17,090
they always use the medicine for to heal

75
00:03:15,169 --> 00:03:18,708
themself for everything so from that

76
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:20,150
we've always been exposed to cannabis

77
00:03:18,709 --> 00:03:22,759
into some really really good outdoor

78
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:25,069
cannabis some plans to reach 5 meter ISM

79
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:27,889
just beautiful beautiful plants their

80
00:03:25,069 --> 00:03:30,079
land races are not as as big as body but

81
00:03:27,889 --> 00:03:31,729
from that we learned a lot about the

82
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,780
medicine it's always been in our culture

83
00:03:31,729 --> 00:03:36,679
our grandmother's use it for arthritis

84
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:38,719
unfortunately my family a lot of people

85
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:40,580
have died from cancer and we never

86
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:43,069
really had this safe access because you

87
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:45,860
always have to literally risked your

88
00:03:43,069 --> 00:03:48,590
life to to do this we've lost a lot of

89
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:51,739
friends all along the way but the idea

90
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:52,930
is that this is this is our freedom and

91
00:03:51,739 --> 00:03:56,438
not only

92
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:58,209
and cannabis bamboo like I say go back

93
00:03:56,438 --> 00:04:00,098
to nature that's where everything comes

94
00:03:58,209 --> 00:04:03,188
from we come from there we go back to

95
00:04:00,098 --> 00:04:05,408
that so throw that we've we try to help

96
00:04:03,188 --> 00:04:08,139
people grow we try and help people with

97
00:04:05,408 --> 00:04:10,090
medicine whatever you guys need at come

98
00:04:08,139 --> 00:04:12,399
to Mexico it's not as bad as it sounds

99
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:15,239
on the new song just give us a call and

100
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,239
we'll have a great time
