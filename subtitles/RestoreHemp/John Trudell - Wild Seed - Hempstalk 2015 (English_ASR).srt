00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:34,660
and the wall is her milk and the oil is

6
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:34,660
her blood and we are her children

7
00:00:36,488 --> 00:00:46,919
in this land we come from of this earth

8
00:00:40,808 --> 00:00:51,238

00:00:56,359 --> 00:01:02,329
land take care of us

12
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:06,790
if we don't take care of the land same

13
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:10,500
with the sky and the air we breathe

14
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:10,500
it's time to remember

15
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:16,049
in the reality of what we reap what we

16
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:20,489
sow

17
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:28,868
the reality is in the land and like is

18
00:01:20,489 --> 00:01:34,649
in the sea sea has memory memory of life

19
00:01:28,868 --> 00:01:38,170
while see memories keeping alive alive

20
00:01:34,649 --> 00:01:43,259
up-close face to face with the

21
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:43,259
destroyers and their synthetic see

22
00:01:44,118 --> 00:01:54,789
toxic poisoning land and buyers this

23
00:01:49,218 --> 00:01:58,209
regarding will be in to maximize profit

24
00:01:54,789 --> 00:02:00,590
abandoning children to massive deaths

25
00:01:58,209 --> 00:02:04,458
making the price of freedom on a

26
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:08,719
portable at the expense of the to

27
00:02:04,459 --> 00:02:12,830
benefit the few like a spreading bad

28
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:18,939
human disease chaos in minds with liars

29
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:23,510
promises CD all fears but new here

30
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:27,739
living in the world of the money man

31
00:02:23,509 --> 00:02:30,759
it's time to think our way out when we

believed are waived

33
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:39,530
Henry shoulders back to life

34
00:02:34,289 --> 00:02:39,530
if we don't use our common sense

35
00:02:41,169 --> 00:02:48,039
we'll see like seeding life

36
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:51,938
and the earth is our mother

37
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:54,539
and the land is our flesh and the water

38
00:02:51,938 --> 00:02:59,549
is her milk

39
00:02:54,539 --> 00:03:01,818
and the oil is her blood and we are her

40
00:02:59,549 --> 00:03:01,819
children

41
00:03:12,729 --> 00:03:23,250
oh just another bad dog one more time
