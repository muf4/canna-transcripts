1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:06,540
aren't we in a pickle really it's a

2
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:08,820
limited to 0.3 and isn't there we don't

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:11,280
doesn't the department of side need to

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:13,980
be pushing the feds to kind of

5
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:15,838
mellow out and allow a broader

6
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:19,800
definition

7
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:22,679
so um the point three percent of THC

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:25,920
definition is actually not in federal

9
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:28,079
law the in federal law

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,340
um they don't define Industrial Hemp

11
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:32,879
from Cannabis as we've talked about

12
00:00:29,339 --> 00:00:34,439
however it is in our state statute so as

13
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,040
the department of AG

14
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:40,140
it would have to be a legislative action

15
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:44,460
not an agency action

16
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:46,378
um I believe that the 0.3 percent in

17
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:49,679
you guys can probably talk about this

18
00:00:46,378 --> 00:00:50,939
more better than I can but I believe

19
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:53,399
that that's

20
00:00:50,939 --> 00:00:56,519
um kind of an industry standard for

21
00:00:53,399 --> 00:01:00,899
industrial hemp because it cannot be

22
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:05,600
construed as having any value of the THC

23
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:05,599
to to use for drug purposes or

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,799
well yeah so just just a little quick

25
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,859
history and the standard was developed

26
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:18,659
in Europe and then in Canada and so it's

27
00:01:16,859 --> 00:01:21,478
sort of been a de facto International

28
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:23,040
standard we didn't come up with that as

29
00:01:21,478 --> 00:01:24,900
like you know unique we kind of said

30
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,400
okay this is what's working and the

31
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,439
Canadians and Europeans have been able

32
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,659
to develop a hemp industry around that

33
00:01:28,438 --> 00:01:33,419
standard now does it limit you somewhat

34
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:35,219
uh yeah I might you know I mean is there

35
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:37,680
a variety of hemp that you know has half

36
00:01:35,219 --> 00:01:39,179
a percent THC that might be better yeah

37
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,799
it might be and that might be something

38
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:43,200
we need to take a look at down the line

39
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,540
will we ever see a situation where

40
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,219
farmers are going hemp at five or ten

41
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,479
percent THC I seriously doubt it because

42
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:50,399
you're talking about psychoactive

43
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:53,759
varieties that somebody could pull out

44
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,840
of the field and you know smoke so I

45
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,299
think that you have to make a

46
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:59,520
distinction there between generally the

47
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:01,560
internationally it's it's recognized as

48
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:03,298
above one percent you get into varieties

49
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:06,600
that then have psychoactive potential

50
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:08,759
when you're talking about the THC so but

51
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:10,318
um I you know I wouldn't disagree with

52
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:11,399
you that it might be nice to have a

53
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:13,318
little bit higher or have the

54
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,659
flexibility to be able to say hey maybe

55
00:02:13,318 --> 00:02:18,000
you know Ohio them through tents but it

56
00:02:15,659 --> 00:02:20,039
is kind of what what it is

57
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,580
there's a number of crops that have

58
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:22,579
other

59
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:27,120
levels so something like canola has to

60
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:30,660
be below

61
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:33,439
two percent uricic acid so it's it's not

62
00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:36,659
versus industrial

63
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:38,759
rape seeds so it's not uncommon to have

64
00:02:36,659 --> 00:02:41,280
these kind of biological limits in there

65
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:44,219
are seed certification systems both in

66
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,979
Europe Canada here in the U.S that once

67
00:02:44,219 --> 00:02:49,500
you've got varieties

68
00:02:45,979 --> 00:02:52,439
that are known to have these low levels

69
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:54,120
to maintain those is not a problem you

70
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:56,098
can do cross breeding among the

71
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,860
varieties that are low

72
00:02:56,098 --> 00:03:01,280
in the THC levels and you should be able

73
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:04,379
you know there may be the occasional

74
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:06,479
variety that would be useful or may have

75
00:03:04,378 --> 00:03:08,878
some useful characteristic through

76
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:10,318
traditional plant breeding you can

77
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:12,419
oftentimes

78
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:14,158
take something like that breed it into

79
00:03:12,419 --> 00:03:17,039
your low

80
00:03:14,158 --> 00:03:19,620
lines and breed something that has the

81
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:22,199
new characteristic using standard

82
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:23,819
breeding techniques

83
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:25,859
uh when I lived in Northern Illinois

84
00:03:23,818 --> 00:03:29,119
before I moved here there were still

85
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:32,819
acreage and some of them at State Park

86
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:35,400
of hemp fields that was left over from

87
00:03:32,818 --> 00:03:37,738
World War II do we not have any research

88
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:40,860
data on growing hemp for those years

89
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:45,658
that might help us as we look at this

90
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:47,099
new era of gloriousness yeah we to

91
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:49,500
answer your second question the first

92
00:03:47,098 --> 00:03:52,439
the we do actually the the picture that

93
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:54,239
Errol showed of the 15-foot Hall tall

94
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:56,459
hemp plants in Arlington that was

95
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,319
actually a USDA researcher named

96
00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:01,019
Leicester Dewey who grew up in Arlington

97
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:01,979
Farms which is now where the Pentagon is

98
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:05,580
located in our

99
00:04:01,979 --> 00:04:07,560
Virginia and uh he's he we've actually

100
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:09,480
got his Diaries uh you know he had

101
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,620
published a lot of research on it so we

102
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:12,238
had a lot of historical stuff and I

103
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:14,700
noticed that Rick has a great book here

104
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,019
too by Chris Conrad called hope Lifeline

105
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:18,000
the future there's some other books out

106
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:19,620
there it's not you know super technical

107
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,279
on the growing side but there is a lot

108
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:25,199
of historical information out there um

109
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:28,019
and

110
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:30,180
there are bulletins there were the USDA

111
00:04:28,019 --> 00:04:33,539
and others other states did research

112
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:36,540
bulletins back in the 40s so that kind

113
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:39,540
of information is available

114
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:42,419
report there was a USDA and research

115
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:43,979
service reading program in Wisconsin had

116
00:04:42,418 --> 00:04:46,319
been here in Oregon

117
00:04:43,978 --> 00:04:48,599
down in Corvallis and Albany and they

118
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:50,639
pulled it out in the late 1930s and

119
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,160
moved it to Wisconsin because conditions

120
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,540
were better there

121
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:57,060
unfortunately as we went through this

122
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:59,520
whole craze in the 40s and 50s they

123
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:01,978
dumped all the germ plasm so

124
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:04,379
historically where material was put into

125
00:05:01,978 --> 00:05:06,139
a national germ classroom repository

126
00:05:04,379 --> 00:05:08,759
there's none of that

127
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:11,340
present these days but there are

128
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:13,439
international seed sources

129
00:05:11,339 --> 00:05:15,659
has any thought been given through the

130
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:16,620
organization as they have

131
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:19,439
foreign

132
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:22,560
carbon

133
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:24,839
yeah so the carbon sequestration is

134
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,600
definitely uh you know I mean that's

135
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:30,599
that's a that's a fact and the the

136
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,460
building with uh hemp herd where they're

137
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,020
basically locking it into you know

138
00:05:32,459 --> 00:05:36,959
mixing it with lime and then and then

139
00:05:34,019 --> 00:05:38,939
that actually sequesters carbon and the

140
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:41,519
research they did over in the UK on that

141
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:43,199
shows that there's actually more carbon

142
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:44,939
captured in the construction process

143
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,220
than what's not released so it's a

144
00:05:44,939 --> 00:05:48,719
carbon negative construction process so

145
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:51,419
that's pretty incredible and actually I

146
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,699
think that's going to be a huge market

147
00:05:51,418 --> 00:05:55,918
for hemp once we get it grown here it

148
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:58,439
doesn't make any sense to import a herd

149
00:05:55,918 --> 00:05:59,879
is sunlight and bulky it's just burning

150
00:05:58,439 --> 00:06:01,259
towards that from overseas or whatever

151
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:03,360
it makes no sense but once you're

152
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:05,038
growing in here you can build homes you

153
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,720
know and uh right here and they're

154
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:09,478
extremely good thermal properties

155
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,880
there's another other benefits it's uh

156
00:06:09,478 --> 00:06:13,319
because it's using alignment the mold

157
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:14,519
you don't have any problems with mold I

158
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:16,199
don't know if that's a big issue here in

159
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:18,000
Oregon but I think with your letter

160
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:20,400
climate that it might be a big

161
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,139
significant thing so so there's some

162
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:24,659
real advantages there and as far as the

163
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:26,400
fuel goes I just think that uh the the

164
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:27,840
jury's still out I mean there's two ways

165
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:30,299
you can get fuel from Health that I know

166
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:31,799
of anyways but maybe there's more so I'm

167
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,660
not an expert I don't claim to be an

168
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,939
expert on the field but I know the hemp

169
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:38,340
seed I think it's too high value to be

170
00:06:35,939 --> 00:06:39,719
realistic as a mainstream fuel sources

171
00:06:38,339 --> 00:06:42,179
maybe somebody's going to do it on their

172
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:43,860
Farm or something but then the biomass

173
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:45,360
conversion you know there's been

174
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:46,919
research some research on that but that

175
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,259
still isn't fully commercialized except

176
00:06:46,918 --> 00:06:50,639
like with maybe sugarcane and Brazil or

177
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:53,699
something so they haven't gotten there

178
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:57,000
yet but that's definitely potential

179
00:06:53,699 --> 00:07:00,240
so seed is a part of the statute in

180
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:03,300
Oregon and it directs the Department of

181
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:07,259
Agriculture to write rules about the

182
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:09,720
handling of seeds as well as the growing

183
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:12,000
um and selling of seeds so we have

184
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:14,479
regulations already in Oregon actually

185
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,060
of course seed dealers any any

186
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:20,399
agricultural or vegetable seed producer

187
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:21,899
or dealer has to be licensed by the

188
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:24,839
State Department of Agriculture and that

189
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:27,538
will fall under a similar licensing

190
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:29,459
process so that will be something that

191
00:07:27,538 --> 00:07:31,620
will come out in the rules

192
00:07:29,459 --> 00:07:32,719
develop them

193
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:35,160
um

194
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,319
the second the third question I'm sorry

195
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:39,240
was um about potential

196
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:42,598
cross-contamination

197
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:44,460
um and we have OSU sitting on our panel

198
00:07:42,598 --> 00:07:46,439
and we'll hope that they can give us

199
00:07:44,459 --> 00:07:48,779
some guidance there

200
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:50,519
um because the statute sets the limit at

201
00:07:48,779 --> 00:07:51,959
0.3 percent that's one of the things

202
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:53,098
that I mentioned we'll have to talk

203
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:56,038
about

204
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:59,399
um what are the tolerances and and how

205
00:07:56,038 --> 00:08:01,259
we will determine that and we don't know

206
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:04,939
I don't think

207
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:08,639
um I've seen some research or heard that

208
00:08:04,939 --> 00:08:10,279
the cross-contamination having two

209
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:13,800
Fields next to each other could actually

210
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:15,719
damage potentially both not only

211
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:18,538
um you know the THC level that you might

212
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:19,560
be shooting for for medical purposes but

213
00:08:18,538 --> 00:08:21,120
also

214
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:23,399
um keeping the other one under point

215
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,478
three but I'm not a researcher and don't

216
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:25,799
know that

217
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:27,899
um so it will certainly be something

218
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,400
that we'll have to look into

219
00:08:27,899 --> 00:08:32,158
um

220
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:36,139
I don't right now this tattoo doesn't

221
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:40,500
direct us to have control areas

222
00:08:36,139 --> 00:08:42,240
we'll have to work through that that's

223
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:44,278
uh gets into quite a bit of different

224
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,680
other laws in terms of

225
00:08:44,278 --> 00:08:48,659
right to farm and that kind of stuff we

226
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:51,778
do have the Farm Bureau sitting on our

227
00:08:48,659 --> 00:08:53,159
world's advisory committee they're

228
00:08:51,778 --> 00:08:55,500
they're usually involved in those right

229
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:58,278
to farm issues and so hopefully they can

230
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,278
advise us

231
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:03,299
it's typically down you know in a

232
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:05,580
situation like this is there are

233
00:09:03,299 --> 00:09:07,319
generations of seed that are produced so

234
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:09,600
you start with something called breeder

235
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:12,180
seed or Foundation seed and there would

236
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:15,600
be very specific isolation requirements

237
00:09:12,179 --> 00:09:17,278
for where that seed could be grown and

238
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,100
then as you go through the generations

239
00:09:17,278 --> 00:09:23,299
those tend to ease up a bit but

240
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:27,360
oftentimes the commercial crop is not

241
00:09:23,299 --> 00:09:29,099
harvested for subsequent seed use and so

242
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,620
you could have what would be called

243
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:34,200
Foundation registered seed the certified

244
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:37,440
seed would be sold commercially produced

245
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:40,500
so even there if there were some small

246
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,360
level of contamination it's not going to

247
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:44,639
carry into the next generation of the

248
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:46,620
crop but would have to figure out what

249
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:49,439
are the isolation distances that you

250
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:51,419
need to have and then it would be up to

251
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,399
those people to work with their

252
00:09:51,419 --> 00:09:55,199
neighbors to make sure if they're

253
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:57,600
producing early Generation seed that

254
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:01,500
they didn't have medical marijuana

255
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:03,860
those areas to try to keep the THC under

256
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,860
control
