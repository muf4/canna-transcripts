1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,480
I will say that in Washington of might

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:05,099
be surprised for you folks to know we do

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:07,560
not have legalized industrial hemp

4
00:00:05,099 --> 00:00:09,439
cultivation Oh legalize marijuana so

5
00:00:07,559 --> 00:00:12,388
we've not yet passed industrial hemp

6
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:13,980
legislation in Washington and me we do

7
00:00:12,388 --> 00:00:15,889
have an argument as to whether or not it

8
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:18,839
should already legal based upon our

9
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:22,109
state definition of marijuana which

10
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:24,420
which has the qualifier of having a more

11
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:25,920
than twenty three percent THC so that's

12
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:28,380
an interesting thing we have going on in

13
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,019
this state on a federal level so jealous

14
00:00:28,379 --> 00:00:33,390
of Oregon because yours that your

15
00:00:31,018 --> 00:00:35,579
federal senators Wyden and Merkley have

16
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:40,950
priming co-sponsored the industrial hemp

17
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:42,960
farming active 2015 refiled after 2013

18
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:44,579
but that's a very small and simple act

19
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,429
that would remove industrial hemp from

20
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:49,320
the Controlled Substances Act all five

21
00:00:47,429 --> 00:00:52,198
of your federal representatives have

22
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:55,289
co-sponsored the sister bill which is HR

23
00:00:52,198 --> 00:00:57,539
5 25 in the US Congress so Oregon should

24
00:00:55,289 --> 00:01:00,120
be very very proud of itself on on so

25
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:01,829
many levels of I want to mention just

26
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:04,079
that there are so many industries that

27
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:06,269
industrial hemp effects obviously we

28
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:07,429
know about the nutrition but even just

29
00:01:06,269 --> 00:01:09,629
from the seed we would get into

30
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:11,880
cosmeceutical nutraceutical and

31
00:01:09,629 --> 00:01:14,969
industrial oil and all of the

32
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:17,039
derivatives protein powders and even the

33
00:01:14,969 --> 00:01:18,810
byproducts of this eve industry which

34
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,450
are holes which can be used for any

35
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:23,340
number of applications including fillers

36
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:27,030
for biocomposites but we're also talking

37
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:30,478
about apparel textiles paper that

38
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:33,060
industry alone to be able to use hemp

39
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:35,158
blends in in our paper and our recycled

40
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:37,129
fibers but now we're even moving into

41
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:40,920
course of building materials

42
00:01:37,129 --> 00:01:43,109
nanotechnology supercapacitors biomass

43
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:45,930
used for bio medical purposes things

44
00:01:43,109 --> 00:01:48,269
that we never saw coming 25 years ago

45
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:51,180
when i first became interested in the

46
00:01:48,269 --> 00:01:53,849
industrial hemp movement so we also have

47
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:57,780
a future here of planet cleaning and

48
00:01:53,849 --> 00:02:00,269
once we can legalize the both species of

49
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:02,728
cannabis will be able than i think to

50
00:02:00,269 --> 00:02:04,269
move on to expand the way we deal with

51
00:02:02,728 --> 00:02:06,368
agriculture and the healer

52
00:02:04,269 --> 00:02:09,068
the land and the water and the biosphere

53
00:02:06,368 --> 00:02:10,628
and start to marry more permaculture

54
00:02:09,068 --> 00:02:13,109
techniques and move beyond this

55
00:02:10,628 --> 00:02:16,539
sustainable concept and move into

56
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:19,209
regenerative concepts and industrial

57
00:02:16,539 --> 00:02:22,359
hemp and permaculture techniques can

58
00:02:19,209 --> 00:02:24,699
bring the planet into this healing that

59
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:26,769
will be required for us to be able to

60
00:02:24,699 --> 00:02:29,378
deliver the the next seven generations

61
00:02:26,769 --> 00:02:31,450
into into a healthy world so

62
00:02:29,378 --> 00:02:33,429
congratulations Oregon you're doing

63
00:02:31,449 --> 00:02:35,699
something right on a state and federal

64
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:35,700
level
