1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:05,609
and we love our dark skin we are not

2
00:00:03,689 --> 00:00:08,699
ashamed we are not embarrassed

3
00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:10,410
we are not humiliated by the racism in

4
00:00:08,699 --> 00:00:11,759
this country because the people that are

5
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:13,769
pushing it out there they're the ones

6
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:16,589
who should be ashamed of themselves all

7
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:18,618
of us are disgusted by racism [ __ ] that

8
00:00:16,589 --> 00:00:18,618
[ __ ]

9
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:23,759
one of the things that I need to talk

10
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:25,410
about today is not only the

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,349
decriminalization which we're

12
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:31,140
continuously fighting for marijuana use

13
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:32,880
in this city in this state it's supposed

14
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,399
to be legal but we still have to worry

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:38,429
about where we can legally use where we

16
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:41,460
can legally medicate my son is right now

17
00:00:38,429 --> 00:00:44,399
on RSO oil for his seizures he has

18
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:46,469
grandma's seizures the only thing that

19
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:49,950
helps him and his wife who has epilepsy

20
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:53,160
is the use of the cannabis and the oils

21
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:54,629
that it produces but having access to it

22
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:56,459
is the biggest problem for them because

23
00:00:54,628 --> 00:00:58,738
you know what if you can't afford to get

24
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:01,320
it as a medical patient and keep up all

25
00:00:58,738 --> 00:01:03,718
the bureaucracy and policy behind that

26
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,938
then being a recreational user you're

27
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:09,000
still being criminalized and especially

28
00:01:05,938 --> 00:01:11,938
a child with brown skin who has seizures

29
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,010
who might cease during a car while he's

30
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:15,750
driving he might have a seizure at the

31
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:17,939
time that he's walking his kids to the

32
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:21,930
park and you know what's my biggest fear

33
00:01:17,938 --> 00:01:24,478
is that happening that happening and the

34
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:26,159
police hurting him taking his life

35
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:28,409
because they don't know that he's having

36
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,150
an attack they don't know that he's

37
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:32,759
having a health issue at the time

38
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:35,790
because of how we see people that

39
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:37,709
utilize marijuana in this country one of

40
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:40,140
the things that he has to deal with not

41
00:01:37,709 --> 00:01:42,688
only the seizures but having to deal

42
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:44,810
with racism every day he is in an

43
00:01:42,688 --> 00:01:47,669
interracial relationship

44
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:49,530
his wife was told one day by a child

45
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:51,990
that she grew up with that she was a

46
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:55,950
breeder now because she had mixed kids

47
00:01:51,989 --> 00:01:58,319
by my son how humiliating for not only

48
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:03,118
them as a couple that's trying to live

49
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:05,669
in the year 2017 2018 in America to be

50
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:07,618
humiliated by racism but to know that

51
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:10,590
they are pushing that on their children

52
00:02:07,618 --> 00:02:12,000
I advocate for a lot of children and one

53
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:13,039
of the things I tell them is that the

54
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,348
things that are happening

55
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:17,060
right now they're not they're false and

56
00:02:15,348 --> 00:02:19,608
they don't have to carry on the same

57
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:22,039
traditions and values and policies that

58
00:02:19,609 --> 00:02:25,250
we've been taking into consideration to

59
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:29,949
reform they need to break these systems

60
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:32,780
[ __ ] reform it's time for reconstruction

61
00:02:29,949 --> 00:02:34,938
and when we talk about reconstruction we

62
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:37,938
know that it doesn't take rocket science

63
00:02:34,938 --> 00:02:41,269
to make outside public consumption a

64
00:02:37,938 --> 00:02:43,039
thing we know that it adds to the value

65
00:02:41,269 --> 00:02:44,959
of public safety because people don't

66
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:46,848
have to hide what they're doing when

67
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:49,069
they're trying to deal with the girls of

68
00:02:46,848 --> 00:02:50,539
today all of these hills that we're

69
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:54,348
dealing with all of the things that are

70
00:02:50,539 --> 00:02:57,560
creating PTSD in all of us if you didn't

71
00:02:54,348 --> 00:03:00,199
have PTSD before the Trump inauguration

72
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:04,039
there got it now I was in the hospital

73
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:05,869
watching it on morphine dying coming out

74
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:08,598
of a surgery and I knew that we were in

75
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:11,090
for a fight I got out of that hospital

76
00:03:08,598 --> 00:03:13,578
ready I got out of that hospital I

77
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:15,859
connected with the ACLU I connected with

78
00:03:13,579 --> 00:03:19,219
indivisible Oregon I connected with my

79
00:03:15,859 --> 00:03:20,569
community and we kept moving because the

80
00:03:19,219 --> 00:03:22,219
fact that we're getting tired of

81
00:03:20,568 --> 00:03:24,348
fighting it doesn't mean that we're

82
00:03:22,219 --> 00:03:26,000
losing it just means that we have to be

83
00:03:24,348 --> 00:03:28,459
more innovative in the way that we do

84
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,348
our outreach everybody should be on the

85
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:32,180
frontline nobody should be behind we

86
00:03:30,348 --> 00:03:35,149
don't have saviors in this movement we

87
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:37,159
have allies we have comrades we have

88
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:39,289
people that feel the same way that we do

89
00:03:37,158 --> 00:03:42,649
and the only thing that is in between us

90
00:03:39,289 --> 00:03:44,689
is legalities people think that's

91
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:46,729
speaking out freedom of speech that

92
00:03:44,689 --> 00:03:49,239
that's violent people see it as violent

93
00:03:46,729 --> 00:03:52,069
if they don't control the conversation

94
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:54,709
we have right now with the legalization

95
00:03:52,068 --> 00:03:57,858
in the state of Oregon the opportunity

96
00:03:54,709 --> 00:04:00,199
to change that conversation this

97
00:03:57,859 --> 00:04:02,659
industry is making money that money can

98
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:04,639
be used for education and I'm not

99
00:04:02,658 --> 00:04:06,068
talking about only the education in our

100
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:08,419
schools I'm talking about political

101
00:04:06,068 --> 00:04:10,789
education when our numbers and our

102
00:04:08,419 --> 00:04:12,469
neighbors understand the value of what

103
00:04:10,789 --> 00:04:15,378
we're talking about when we need to

104
00:04:12,469 --> 00:04:17,899
continue to influence policy when they

105
00:04:15,378 --> 00:04:21,079
become the allies in this fight we will

106
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:23,299
win when we invest in elected officials

107
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:25,879
that understand the priorities when we

108
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:26,870
talk about public safety and marijuana

109
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:28,430
use

110
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:31,579
and not having our children be chased

111
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:34,728
and chased and shot for having a joint

112
00:04:31,579 --> 00:04:36,769
or a pipe in their pocket when they

113
00:04:34,728 --> 00:04:38,599
understand the value of integrating what

114
00:04:36,769 --> 00:04:40,399
they believe is a better future

115
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:43,669
into where we're talking about having

116
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:46,009
access liberation then that's when those

117
00:04:43,668 --> 00:04:48,589
things will change put your money in

118
00:04:46,009 --> 00:04:48,860
this industry where our future needs to

119
00:04:48,589 --> 00:04:51,619
be

120
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:54,400
give our children access to the guidance

121
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:57,939
that they need give them a blank slate

122
00:04:54,399 --> 00:05:01,129
let's make something that matters happen

123
00:04:57,939 --> 00:05:03,500
we don't have to propagate the falses of

124
00:05:01,129 --> 00:05:07,029
the people that we elect that come to us

125
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:09,709
with lip service voter mouth volume out

126
00:05:07,029 --> 00:05:11,929
if you don't trust them don't give them

127
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:14,029
a chance we in this industry we

128
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:15,769
understand we're second chances look

129
00:05:14,029 --> 00:05:16,579
like and we haven't got them from an

130
00:05:15,769 --> 00:05:18,399
elected leader

131
00:05:16,579 --> 00:05:20,959
we haven't gotten them from a political

132
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:23,089
relationship or legislation they just

133
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:24,978
keep putting our ideas and our thoughts

134
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:29,839
and our necessities on the back burner

135
00:05:24,978 --> 00:05:32,240
no more I'm trying to see a revolution

136
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:34,009
I remember when new approaching Anthony

137
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,960
Johnson when all of that was happening

138
00:05:34,009 --> 00:05:37,219
and I was standing on the front line as

139
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:39,439
the candidate for Multnomah County

140
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:42,169
because I understood it to be a health

141
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:44,300
necessity I understood that having

142
00:05:42,168 --> 00:05:46,549
access to it that it would decrease the

143
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:48,949
necessity for our courts to deal with us

144
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:50,960
on a criminal level and would encourage

145
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:53,839
our health departments and our health

146
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:55,969
resource operators to utilize it as a

147
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:58,939
leverage where there is no opportunity

148
00:05:55,970 --> 00:06:01,550
for those that do not have access to the

149
00:05:58,939 --> 00:06:05,060
health care that will make us healthy we

150
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:06,310
know our Esso works it's on the record

151
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:09,589
it works

152
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:12,470
we know that legal consumption is done

153
00:06:09,589 --> 00:06:14,719
properly through our through our process

154
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:17,090
don't let somebody who's never used we

155
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:20,270
tell you how to policy it how to

156
00:06:17,089 --> 00:06:23,538
legislate it how to make it right we

157
00:06:20,269 --> 00:06:25,659
know it's normal for us we don't want to

158
00:06:23,538 --> 00:06:28,848
be normalized by the [ __ ] politics

159
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:32,979
so let's create where we need and let's

160
00:06:28,848 --> 00:06:32,978
do it together smoke
