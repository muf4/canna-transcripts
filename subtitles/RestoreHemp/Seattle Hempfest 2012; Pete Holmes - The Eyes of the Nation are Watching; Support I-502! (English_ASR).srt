27
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:07,599
we get to vote for the first time any

28
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:10,839
state in this nation to legalize

29
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:15,559
marijuana for adult recreational use

30
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:18,640
it's i502 and it must pass hey guys as

31
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:20,359
Vivian said my office handles lots of

32
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,079
legal matters for this great City and

33
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:25,359
for the for its citizens one of those is

34
00:01:23,078 --> 00:01:27,758
that I'm the chief uh criminal

35
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:29,959
prosecutor and that means that I'm

36
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,560
responsible for Public Safety that means

37
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:33,438
I'm supposed to hold accountable people

38
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:36,280
who would endanger the well-being of

39
00:01:33,438 --> 00:01:39,679
others but when adults use marijuana in

40
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:43,399
a responsible fashion it's just wrong to

41
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:46,280
label them criminals it's just wrong

42
00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:48,519
that's why that's why 3 years ago in my

43
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:50,799
campaign I promised to never file

44
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:53,599
another marijuana possession charge

45
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:55,759
again and I have kept that promise and

46
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:57,399
as long as I'm your City attorney I will

47
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:00,560
I will keep that

48
00:01:57,399 --> 00:02:02,680
promise but guys don't take this for

49
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,359
granted this beautiful Park this great

50
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:07,399
Festival that we're having remember you

51
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:09,239
can still be arrested in Seattle for

52
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:11,400
possession just because I won't charge

53
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:14,200
you you can still be arrested and once

54
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,120
you go beyond Seattle it's a completely

55
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:18,799
different

56
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,879
story and so don't take this for granted

57
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,920
we need to come together we need to

58
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:25,639
recognize there is one opportunity on

59
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:29,359
the November ballot and that is to vote

60
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:30,799
Yes on 502 and send a clear message a

61
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,760
clear message message along with

62
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,719
Colorado along with Oregon and tell the

63
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:39,120
federal government that prohibition is

64
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:42,680
wrong it's time for it to come to an end

65
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,680
that's what we need to come together

66
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:49,200
on you know hempest has been home here

67
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:50,840
for 21 years and medical marijuana is

68
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:53,238
something that the city of Seattle has

69
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,759
tried to make available for all of for

70
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:57,360
all of its its

71
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:58,799
patients but other cities are are

72
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,400
cracking down on dispensaries they're

73
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,599
cracking down on patients

74
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,920
and remember I'm just one prosecutor and

75
00:03:02,598 --> 00:03:08,719
just one city and we need to make sure

76
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:10,878
that we change the law it's not enough

77
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:12,840
to elect a good prosecutor you need to

78
00:03:10,878 --> 00:03:14,719
change the law and that's what we're

79
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:17,158
here to talk about with

80
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:19,680
502 we need a complete solution to

81
00:03:17,158 --> 00:03:22,039
Prohibition it's written supported and

82
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,280
passed by the people and it's not just

83
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:28,519
for people here in Seattle it's for

84
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:31,039
wachi and Spokan and chahalis Auburn and

85
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:33,200
Kent and it's a challenge to the root

86
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:35,438
problem of federal

87
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:38,598
prohibition patients and recreational

88
00:03:35,438 --> 00:03:41,318
users alike when 502 is pass will have

89
00:03:38,598 --> 00:03:43,759
real arrest protection real arrest

90
00:03:41,318 --> 00:03:45,839
protection that's what 502 will do right

91
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:48,878
now and it will send that message to

92
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:51,200
Washington DC that prohibition is

93
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:53,479
over all right I'm going to wrap it up

94
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:55,399
now guys but remember this November we

95
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:57,399
have a chance to redirect law

96
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:59,200
enforcement priorities to make sure that

97
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,319
we reclaim Industrial Hemp for the state

98
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:02,958
of Washington

99
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:04,719
let's make sure that we have a yes on

100
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,640
502 and send a message along with

101
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:10,639
Colorado and Oregon thank you everyone

102
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:10,639
thank Seattle you
