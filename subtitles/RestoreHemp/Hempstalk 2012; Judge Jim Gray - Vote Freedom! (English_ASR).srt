governor gary johnson from new mexico

11
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:25,919
governor gary johnson has actually done

12
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,960
this while he was governor he stood up

13
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,359
in 1999 and said the obvious the

14
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,840
nation's war on drugs is not working and

15
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:36,399

19
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:45,359
wrong

20
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,239
and if that's not enough and it should

21
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:48,878
be

22
00:00:46,238 --> 00:00:51,359
but if that's not enough understand

23
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:52,640
that you can elect romney you can elect

24
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:54,159
obama

25
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:58,320
they're the same

26
00:00:54,159 --> 00:01:00,718
i call them robomny they're the same

27
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,320
if we do elect that either of them there

28
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,159
won't be any medical marijuana

29
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,680
dispensaries in our country within a

30
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,118
year or two from now

31
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,400
none

32
00:01:07,118 --> 00:01:12,640
it's out of control we need to elect

33
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,640
governor gary johnson it's the only

34
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,759
chance for survival for medical

35
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,359
marijuana dispensaries in our country

36
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,920
in addition

37
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:24,560
something hugely important

38
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:27,759
we as a candidacy have endorsed the

39
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:30,640
initiative here in oregon initiative 80

40
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:33,118
to treat marijuana like alcohol we need

41
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,759
to get this word out and we can do it

42
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:38,478
alone you can't do it alone but together

43
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:41,519
we can get this done measure 80 has got

44
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:44,000
to pass

45
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:48,399
that's not loud enough i said did you

46
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,399
hear me measure 80 has got to pass

47
00:01:50,078 --> 00:01:54,239
same thing in washington we've endorsed

48
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:56,798
both of those initiatives same thing in

49
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:58,798
colorado we've endorsed that initiative

50
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,880
there as well we're going to put it

51
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,680
right to the federal government the

52
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:06,640
people of these states demand that they

53
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:09,118
be allowed to choose the way to treat

54
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,120
marijuana and i say let's treat it just

55
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:13,598
like my drug of choice let's treat it

56
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,840
just like wine that's the answer to go

57
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:15,840
for

58
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:23,840
i'm not sure you're convinced that's

59
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,840
what we need to go for

60
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,680
and for heaven's sake let's treat hemp

61
