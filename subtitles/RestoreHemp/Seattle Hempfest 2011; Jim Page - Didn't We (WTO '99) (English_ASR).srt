1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,399
song about when the wto came here to

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,399
town

3
00:00:04,719 --> 00:00:11,080
and all those streets downtown were

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:11,080
declared no go zones but we went anyway

5
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:33,280
november 30th 99 history walking on a

6
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,600
tight road flying and making money

7
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,399
pulling on invisible strings

8
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,079
getting into everything [Â __Â ]

9
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,840
it's hard to believe it's in the food

10
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,119
and the water and the air you breathe

11
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,800
and the chemistry

12
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:46,959
the biotech

13
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:49,280
the banker with the bottomless check the

14
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:52,320
corporations and the ceos and the bottom

15
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:54,480
line as the profit grows the money talks

16
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,480
you don't talk back they don't like it

17
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:59,799
when you act like that but didn't we

18
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:59,799
talk back

19
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:15,438
coming to town and we swore we gonna

20
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:17,359
shut it down and they stood there with

21
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:19,438
their big police they had the national

22
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:21,280
guard up to keep the peace with the guns

23
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:23,438
and the gloves and the chemical gas but

24
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:27,200
still we would not let them pass

25
00:01:23,438 --> 00:01:27,199
they raised and brought in their tempers

26
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,400
shut it down

27
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:47,280
november 30th 99 millennium passing as

28
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,799
the numbers climb and the people came

29
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,118
from middleweight

30
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:53,439
must have been 50 000 out there there

31
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:55,759
were farmers unions rank and file they

32
00:01:53,438 --> 00:01:57,599
dig your ass or it says its own style

33
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,439
they were great big puppets two stories

34
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:01,359
tall there were drummers drumming in the

35
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:03,359
shopping mall there was so many people

36
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:06,159
that you couldn't see how [Â __Â ] many

37
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:08,399
people got into the city and the wt no

38
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:11,280
delegates too but we were locked down so

39
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,280
they couldn't get through

40
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,360
shut it down

41
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:24,000
november 30th 99 locked down at the

42
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,439
police line and they're hitting you with

43
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,520
everything they got

44
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:29,280
but you ain't moving like it or not and

45
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,040
they're tying your wrists with plastic

46
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,640
cups and they're loading these up on a

47
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:34,719
great big box and they're taking you

48
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:37,039
down to the navy base

49
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:37,039
pepper

50
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:51,840
shut it down

51
00:03:12,878 --> 00:03:16,479
now the media loves all the glittering

52
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:18,000
flash the newspaper's talking out a

53
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:19,919
whole lot of trash about the violence of

54
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
the people in black and how the cops are

55
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:23,919
so tired it has had to attack and the

56
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,759
secrets hidden in a man deep dark hole

57
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:28,399
look what they call city hall may never

58
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:30,318
be told the mayor is out doing the spin

59
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,959
the police chief quit so you can't ask

60
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:32,958
him where they

61
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:47,840

62
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,840
didn't we

63
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,759
now it's the greatest story ever told

64
00:03:56,158 --> 00:03:59,359
david and goliath though you'd be so

65
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:01,199

going gets hot and all you got is a

67
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:04,158
slingshot

68
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,598

72
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,799

73
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,480

00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:16,639
that it can't be done cause they're

75
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:18,879
