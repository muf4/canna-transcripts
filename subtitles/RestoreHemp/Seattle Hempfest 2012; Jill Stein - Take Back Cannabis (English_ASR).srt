1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:07,040
so we can fix it say no to the politics

2
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:09,960
of fear say no to that politics that

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:13,000
tells you we don't dare stand up for

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:16,519
what we deserve and what we can afford

5

jobs health care public higher education

6
00:00:16,519 --> 00:00:21,079
instead of bailing out the crooks at the

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,839
banks who got us into this mess we need

8
00:00:21,079 --> 00:00:27,358
to bail out the students who are living

9
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:30,640
like indentured servants and we can bail

10
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:33,800
out and we can bail out the home owners

11
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:36,399
who are losing our homes by the millions

12
00:00:33,799 --> 00:00:39,319
while the banks continue rolling in

13
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:42,759
their trillions of dollars that we paid

14
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:45,238
them to stop the Foreclosure crisis they

15
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:48,558
haven't stopped it one bit all of this

16
00:00:45,238 --> 00:00:51,038
