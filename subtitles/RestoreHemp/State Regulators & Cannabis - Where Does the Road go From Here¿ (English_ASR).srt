1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,798
so you could imagine I was there the

2
00:00:02,339 --> 00:00:06,479
Attorney General Ferguson was there with

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:09,240
keynote speaker don't open off the

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,599
conference and everybody had excited the

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:15,150
next day so I took a few minutes to

6
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:17,579
speak to the group and said well I know

7
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:21,269
we're frustrated and disappointed but

8
00:00:17,579 --> 00:00:23,159
not shocked so I think it could have

9
00:00:21,269 --> 00:00:25,710
been a lot worse they could have not

10
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,778
only resented they called memorandum but

11
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:30,570
they could have replaced it and told the

12
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:32,609
u.s. states to move forward and closing

13
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:34,710
down the businesses so to be totally

14
00:00:32,609 --> 00:00:38,219
honest with you not sure why it took a

15
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:39,649
whole year to resend a memo but we've

16
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:41,640
been waiting for the Obama

17
00:00:39,649 --> 00:00:43,920
administration to defer the Trump

18
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:47,329
administration to give us some guidance

19
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:49,710
around that so I basically say stay calm

20
00:00:47,329 --> 00:00:51,539
the Attorney General and our governor

21
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:53,128
and several legislators from both

22
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:56,219
parties have a press conference the next

23
00:00:53,128 --> 00:01:00,390
day stating that they would defend the

24
00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:02,698
state law so I think I think from our

25
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:04,140
point of view we continue to use the

26
00:01:02,698 --> 00:01:06,688
guidance of the called memorandum we're

27
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:09,180
not walking away from that I mean if

28
00:01:06,688 --> 00:01:11,279
others are I think it's important to

29
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:13,409
understand the sessions said it gives a

30
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,629
more authority and power to the States

31
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:17,090
District Attorney's and thus far state

32
00:01:15,629 --> 00:01:19,500
of Washington District Attorney

33
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:24,259
supportive supporting the state and

34
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,259
their well well to be honest we really

35
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:31,799
like ours and others we're reaching out

36
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:34,170
to our acting US Attorney's because we

37
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:34,730
don't have appointees of the new

38
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:36,980
administer

39
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:39,260
right now to sit down with them and walk

40
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:40,850
through the story that we have into our

41
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:42,980
congressional delegation that we met

42
00:01:40,849 --> 00:01:45,019
with last year and that we're also

43
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:47,510
meeting with in the next couple months

44
00:01:45,019 --> 00:01:48,619
to talk about health that they can give

45
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:52,219
us with respect to the federal

46
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:53,900
government but we continue to now reach

47
00:01:52,219 --> 00:01:56,329
out to those who as attorneys just like

48
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:58,700
many of the things like Oregon is to

49
00:01:56,329 --> 00:02:01,250
make sure we have that conversations all

50
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:04,700
right Steve Billy where the composts are

51
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:06,590
they going well so first you know the

52
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:08,960
Cole memo went away and on state change

53
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:11,569
in our policies a lot of the provisions

54
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:14,480
of the Cole memo trying in Oregon law

55
00:02:11,569 --> 00:02:16,669
and our sets of regulations clearly

56
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:18,079
that's going to be a focal point it's

57
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:21,049
probably the entire structure here in

58
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:23,180
Oregon and you know that we work done

59
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:26,600
enforcement now we've had criminal

60
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:28,909
activity and we've already coordinated

61
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:30,620
with law enforcement and the US

62
00:02:28,909 --> 00:02:32,509
Attorney's Office along the way and

63
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:35,629
there's been cases that involve criminal

64
00:02:32,509 --> 00:02:38,719
activity I don't see a change in the

65
00:02:35,629 --> 00:02:41,329
focus of the US attorney on criminal

66
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:42,590
activity but the summon is very

67
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:45,050
encouraging to me

68
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:46,878
because he's taking the time to get

69
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:48,860
educated about what's happening on the

70
00:02:46,878 --> 00:02:50,929
ground here in Oregon I think he's

71
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:53,989
interested to learn and there is they

72
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:55,700
haven't had much experience with if they

73
00:02:53,989 --> 00:02:58,430
didn't know what they were doing as well

74
00:02:55,699 --> 00:03:00,949
under with the lack of you know decision

75
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:02,540
making the precision in directions of

76
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:05,568
the Trump administration now I think

77
00:03:02,539 --> 00:03:06,109
they've got some economy within two

78
00:03:05,568 --> 00:03:08,238
regions

79
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:24,260
I think look at what's happening and I

80
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:26,870
very much appreciate your conversations

81
00:03:24,259 --> 00:03:28,280
as far the focus has remained if you're

82
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:30,920
diverting product of the illegal market

83
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:34,549
or you're just plain operating illegal

84
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:35,839
market that's bad if you're being legal

85
00:03:34,549 --> 00:03:37,459
if you're following the rules and or

86
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,829
being compliant with so you still

87
00:03:37,459 --> 00:03:41,299
tracking the old CC framework nothing

88
00:03:39,829 --> 00:03:43,189
has changed no focus change that didn't

89
00:03:41,299 --> 00:03:44,689
change anything from his perspective no

90
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:45,919
focused change there but I think y'all

91
00:03:44,689 --> 00:03:48,109
read his and

92
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:49,939
of this done how much supply were

93
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:51,650
generally isn't that just his problem

94
00:03:49,939 --> 00:03:53,719
problem for all of us in this industry

95
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:55,280
right now about how that plus supply is

96
00:03:53,719 --> 00:04:00,530
going to be consumed what happens with

97
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:02,870
that cannot mix with the pressure is so

98
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:04,280
what I hear as a licensee is if you grew

99
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:06,620
it in the legal market of extracting the

100
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:09,020
legal market if you're a legal licensee

101
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:11,209
the focus will be the worst thing that

102
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:12,800
we could do as an industry is take

103
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:15,949
product that was produced legally and

104
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:19,280
diverted people that are doing that

105
00:04:15,949 --> 00:04:21,439
should expect to have penalties as

106
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:23,779
always it gets a lot but people that are

107
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:25,339
being inside the market there might be

108
00:04:23,779 --> 00:04:27,079
price reductions there may be product

109
00:04:25,339 --> 00:04:29,209
that goes bad lots of things could

110
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:31,728
happen to that but we as an industry

111
00:04:29,209 --> 00:04:33,500
need to give confidence to the OCC as

112
00:04:31,728 --> 00:04:35,659
well as use to the district attorney the

113
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:37,459
product that's inside the market will be

114
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:39,110
dealt with appropriately and it won't be

115
00:04:37,459 --> 00:04:41,409
diverted out that's the worst thing that

116
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:45,439
we can do a couple bad actors could

117
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:46,790
change the focus to the industry that is

118
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:47,719
legal which we all have our addresses

119
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:49,430
and phone numbers and contact

120
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:51,380
information it's easier for them find us

121
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:54,139
so everything we can do to be better

122
00:04:51,379 --> 00:04:57,079
than that is important and so you

123
00:04:54,139 --> 00:04:58,610
address it I just follow up on that this

124
00:04:57,079 --> 00:05:01,009
is kind of getting on the down side of

125
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:03,889
industry right now but you know as well

126
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:05,959
come in was welcoming as we were in

127
00:05:03,889 --> 00:05:07,279
bringing people in and getting them into

128
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:09,889
the system and trying to make the

129
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:12,469
licensing process this penetrable as

130
00:05:09,889 --> 00:05:14,060
possible one of the flip sides of that

131
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:16,370
is we're gonna have to help you when you

132
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:18,168
need to find when you decide you need to

133
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:20,300
get out of the business and figure out

134
00:05:18,168 --> 00:05:22,189
ways that get those inventories

135
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:24,470
and how we can help you get to that

136
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:26,089
point to make it easier to turn in your

137
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:28,370
license if you need to if you're at that

138
00:05:26,089 --> 00:05:30,139
point we're at the tipping scale and you

139
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:32,030
need to get out and have this product in

140
00:05:30,139 --> 00:05:33,740
the market we've got to help you get

141
00:05:32,029 --> 00:05:35,839
that product out of your business and

142
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:36,439
into places and our legal system where

143
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:40,429
it should be

144
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:42,680
we've had companies that have you know

145
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:44,689
destroy their product just to get out

146
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:47,030
cleanly right now and that's what they

147
00:05:44,689 --> 00:05:49,000
wanted to do they have that ethic about

148
00:05:47,029 --> 00:05:52,549
the system and taking the product

149
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:55,430
skipping it elsewhere in the world er so

150
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:57,439
we want to work on that too just to make

151
00:05:55,430 --> 00:06:01,509
sure that you know they should do online

152
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:05,589
that you can do so readily for those the

153
00:06:01,509 --> 00:06:07,310
yep actually so that tells me to

154
00:06:05,589 --> 00:06:09,049
something that happened that Ricky

155
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:11,449
mentioned earlier maybe someone has

156
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:13,329
heard about minor decoyed system from a

157
00:06:11,449 --> 00:06:16,519
compliance X that we've done in Oregon

158
00:06:13,329 --> 00:06:18,229
we went out minder decoy system for

159
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:20,180
everybody that knows is someone goes out

160
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:22,460
with under 21 tries to purchase product

161
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:25,819
from a licensed retailer they have an ID

162
00:06:22,459 --> 00:06:28,399
that says they're under 21 as a big red

163
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:29,839
box on it or even says I'm under 21

164
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:31,849
they're not trying to trick anybody that

165
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:33,859
was my first question is are they really

166
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:36,140
crafty fake IDs guys with long beards

167
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:37,699
looking like they're you know 35 and

168
00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:40,969
it's know it looks like a child with an

169
00:06:37,699 --> 00:06:43,399
ID that says I'm a child under 21 and we

170
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:45,890
didn't do so great I think you said that

171
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:48,349
was that's to be expected to some degree

172
00:06:45,889 --> 00:06:51,769
for a very new industry we have to be

173
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:54,500
better that is one of the things if we

174
00:06:51,769 --> 00:06:56,299
as an industry fail that consumers gonna

175
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:59,689
draw a lot of undue attention you guys

176
00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:02,240
agree so Rick you speak to that how that

177
00:06:59,689 --> 00:07:03,290
went Washington you guys had to start

178
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,189
how long did it take you just really

179
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:07,610
start doing those kind

180
00:07:04,189 --> 00:07:10,819
did you do them now and well we do at

181
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:13,040
least three or four visits a year but we

182
00:07:10,819 --> 00:07:15,199
initially did it we saw the same results

183
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:17,240
because no one had ever done compliance

184
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,889
checks for these retailers so it kind of

185
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:21,439
made sense it in Washington it's a

186
00:07:18,889 --> 00:07:23,810
vertical ID if you're 21 it's a

187
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:25,819
horizontal ID so it wasn't really hard

188
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:28,250
to know that your life given piece of ID

189
00:07:25,819 --> 00:07:30,560
that says the individuals likely to be

190
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:33,560
under 21 but again just for the

191
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,720
experience of it it didn't take long for

192
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:37,699
the industry to understand that this is

193
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:39,290
problematic we've got to make sure we go

194
00:07:37,699 --> 00:07:41,329
right back and if there's if there's a

195
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:44,780
sale we'll be back in within three

196
00:07:41,329 --> 00:07:46,430
months to see if folks have learned how

197
00:07:44,779 --> 00:07:49,069
to do that and a lot of times it means

198
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:51,170
we're doing training again with the

199
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:54,139
employees there to help them but I

200
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:56,449
wasn't really surprised to see the

201
00:07:54,139 --> 00:07:58,459
numbers though I saw I read the reports

202
00:07:56,449 --> 00:08:00,139
that people were very concerned well I

203
00:07:58,459 --> 00:08:03,560
think they should be concerned but you

204
00:08:00,139 --> 00:08:05,329
should understand maybe fifty or sixty

205
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:07,040
percent would have been alarming you

206
00:08:05,329 --> 00:08:09,259
were still lie even for the first

207
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:10,819
compliance checks you'd ever seen it

208
00:08:09,259 --> 00:08:12,800
will get better I mean that's what I

209
00:08:10,819 --> 00:08:14,420
keep telling Steve because that was our

210
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:18,500
decision and that's the experience of

211
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:20,360
the other of the other states Raymond

212
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:23,149
Rick's been through it but I'm not as

213
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:24,919
ready to forgive or forget or not to

214
00:08:23,149 --> 00:08:27,168
follow through we're in that stage of

215
00:08:24,918 --> 00:08:28,519
compliance now where you got perform and

216
00:08:27,168 --> 00:08:31,579
I can tell you there's nothing been

217
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:35,149
there has been nothing more damaging

218
00:08:31,579 --> 00:08:38,299
for a report on minor ID checks your

219
00:08:35,149 --> 00:08:41,600
friends and government are really really

220
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:44,209
disappointed and we have pockets that

221
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:47,570
were well below 50% Portland

222
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:48,860
metropolitan area is a business and

223
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:51,860
we're going to get that together I mean

224
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:53,990
there's a color you know coloring around

225
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:56,180
the box in the picture right there so

226
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:58,370
this is a visual thing was just lack of

227
00:08:56,179 --> 00:09:00,709
training lack of willingness to follow

228
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:02,509
through you know when we started this we

229
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:05,660
wanted to do I gained checking at the

230
00:09:02,509 --> 00:09:08,179
door and that was a bill and that didn't

231
00:09:05,659 --> 00:09:10,610
happen so that you know no one under 21

232
00:09:08,179 --> 00:09:12,049
or 18 if you get a medical start can get

233
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:13,820
in that would have helped with you

234
00:09:12,049 --> 00:09:15,859
compliance so we have help that we can

235
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:18,440
give you to get into compliance we want

236
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:21,590
help me being compliance but I can't

237
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:23,660
tell you how much immediate pressure

238
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:25,250
that I felt from the political

239
00:09:23,659 --> 00:09:28,129
leadership of the state when those

240
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:31,220
statistics came out they want changes

241
00:09:28,129 --> 00:09:33,470
they don't like our penalty schedule and

242
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:36,170
they're very excited about so this is a

243
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:38,269
case study for all the next things that

244
00:09:36,169 --> 00:09:40,129
are going to roll out for us because we

245
00:09:38,269 --> 00:09:41,809
really haven't been full retail check-in

246
00:09:40,129 --> 00:09:44,299
yet they haven't have procedures in

247
00:09:41,809 --> 00:09:46,609
place you know we're never going to get

248
00:09:44,299 --> 00:09:48,979
in the labs roll into only the tail end

249
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:50,840
of this process or do more complete

250
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:53,000
audits and inspections but all those

251
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:55,009
things are coming I think we've been

252
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,830
good through the Bulls of telling yet

253
00:09:55,009 --> 00:10:00,620
expect this expect that get ready for

254
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:02,240
this and laying it out I mean we've sewn

255
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:04,209
out there are Bolton's before the

256
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,149
December

257
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:10,508
Claire checks you know it's coming I

258
00:10:06,149 --> 00:10:13,350
came and didn't do so well so I know

259
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:15,490
we're gonna get better but I'm

260
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:19,509
frustrated by it I thought we were ahead

261
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:21,549
of the game on them and our Commission's

262
00:10:19,509 --> 00:10:22,928
gonna be considering some actions I

263
00:10:21,549 --> 00:10:26,649
don't know what they'll take that

264
00:10:22,928 --> 00:10:28,119
they're disappointed and we had a chance

265
00:10:26,649 --> 00:10:31,089
to talk last night and it was very

266
00:10:28,119 --> 00:10:32,829
apparent that both Rick and Steve that

267
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:35,290
your intentions are to help the industry

268
00:10:32,828 --> 00:10:37,328
be better it is not to say gotcha

269
00:10:35,289 --> 00:10:38,678
and that's a big view as a licensee

270
00:10:37,328 --> 00:10:42,328
that's coming in the OCC

271
00:10:38,678 --> 00:10:46,240
WLC be are coming in to actually help us

272
00:10:42,328 --> 00:10:48,698
maintain compliance to keep focus off

273
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,169
the regulated industry undue focus off

274
00:10:48,698 --> 00:10:53,198
the regulated industry and help us be

275
00:10:50,169 --> 00:10:56,588
better and so it is important extremely

276
00:10:53,198 --> 00:10:58,299
important that everyone's compliant and

277
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:59,860
you guys in your agencies are doing

278
00:10:58,299 --> 00:11:02,708
everything you can to help and willing

279
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:04,539
to help in any way human consequence of

280
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:06,609
not having that training I mean the

281
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:08,938
worker has a worker permit and you know

282
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:11,649
they're potentially going to lose that

283
00:11:08,938 --> 00:11:13,509
they get fired you know a bunch of those

284
00:11:11,649 --> 00:11:15,578
that failed fired their workers and

285
00:11:13,509 --> 00:11:17,740
failed to eject and I say whether that's

286
00:11:15,578 --> 00:11:20,289
right or wrong an alcohol side because

287
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:21,818
it's true that it's you know whether

288
00:11:20,289 --> 00:11:23,980
there's remedial training and that's

289
00:11:21,818 --> 00:11:27,490
what we should be because Schedule one

290
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:29,829
drug all now new system this is the

291
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:31,869
simplest of things to make happen right

292
00:11:29,828 --> 00:11:34,269
and we need to make it happen I I

293
00:11:31,869 --> 00:11:36,639
remember there was there was some

294
00:11:34,269 --> 00:11:38,139
surprise when we began our first in

295
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:40,089
compliance checks and we talked about it

296
00:11:38,139 --> 00:11:41,860
last night we actually sent letters to

297
00:11:40,089 --> 00:11:44,559
all the retailer's telling we were

298
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:47,350
coming we also did press releases to the

299
00:11:44,558 --> 00:11:49,600
medians that were coming why would you

300
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:51,970
do that well because we won voluntary

301
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,089
compliance we're not there to stick the

302
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:55,160
retailer we just

303
00:11:53,089 --> 00:11:56,649
to make sure you're checking ID and that

304
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:59,240
probably had something to do but I think

305
00:11:56,649 --> 00:12:01,068
Oricon did the same thing but to your

306
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:02,808
point I think we're trying to get

307
00:12:01,068 --> 00:12:05,719
voluntary compliance without having to

308
00:12:02,808 --> 00:12:07,549
write violations hey you guys your

309
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:09,499
agency exists and gets money when the

310
00:12:07,549 --> 00:12:11,179
industry is successful just growing and

311
00:12:09,499 --> 00:12:12,949
thriving there is no purpose and that's

312
00:12:11,179 --> 00:12:14,628
a theme that I always get and I try to

313
00:12:12,948 --> 00:12:16,729
tell everybody tonight I get a public

314
00:12:14,629 --> 00:12:17,930
forum to do it is the olds you see in

315
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:20,509
the Liquor Control Board in Washington

316
00:12:17,929 --> 00:12:21,679
is here to support the industry and help

317
00:12:20,509 --> 00:12:23,600
them move forward the best that I can

318
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:25,039
and there's rules and guidelines that we

319
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,920
all need to follow about because of that

320
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:30,078
so that kind of brings me to my next

321
00:12:26,919 --> 00:12:34,549
topic some people think there's too much

322
00:12:30,078 --> 00:12:37,818
product Morrigan right now why it could

323
00:12:34,549 --> 00:12:39,948
cause some concern right I'm imagining

324
00:12:37,818 --> 00:12:42,948
outside of my interview boy there's

325
00:12:39,948 --> 00:12:46,159
going to be increased compliance checks

326
00:12:42,948 --> 00:12:47,958
on where that product goes once it

327
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:50,149
enters into the metric system it's legal

328
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:52,338
it's grown produced where does it end up

329
00:12:50,149 --> 00:12:53,749
that's really really important the next

330
00:12:52,339 --> 00:12:55,430
worst thing that could happen outside of

331
00:12:53,749 --> 00:12:58,490
selling to minors is a bunch of legal

332
00:12:55,429 --> 00:13:01,519
product in Kansas that was produced in

333
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:03,980
Oregon so great I mean what did you guys

334
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:08,028
do originally did you see that much of

335
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:11,089
an issue over production of course now

336
00:13:08,028 --> 00:13:13,549
because we learned and so it's back to

337
00:13:11,089 --> 00:13:15,259
this Gold Rush mentality that occurred

338
00:13:13,549 --> 00:13:17,568
five years ago as it did in most of the

339
00:13:15,259 --> 00:13:19,039
states with legalization I don't think

340
00:13:17,568 --> 00:13:21,378
people recognize how bumpy the ride

341
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:23,269
would be and how it continues to be

342
00:13:21,379 --> 00:13:25,519
bumpy given that you've got this

343
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:27,678
violation of federal law so you create

344
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:31,289
assistance is so restrictive and I

345
00:13:27,678 --> 00:13:36,519
recognize so expensive for the industry

346
00:13:31,289 --> 00:13:37,629
but you know I you didn't have the same

347
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:38,049
tissue that we're having right now are

348
00:13:37,629 --> 00:13:40,210
you

349
00:13:38,049 --> 00:13:42,429
well not initially you have me started

350
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:44,950
with the producer licenses of March and

351
00:13:42,429 --> 00:13:45,669
we issued retail licenses July and guess

352
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:47,920
what happened

353
00:13:45,669 --> 00:13:49,389
we had an undersea life so what do we

354
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:51,279
learn from that we should have given at

355
00:13:49,389 --> 00:13:54,939
least six months to five months before

356
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:56,860
we opened our first retail shops so I

357
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:59,310
suspect there was an oversupply and

358
00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:01,720
Morgan in Washington before legalization

359
00:13:59,309 --> 00:14:04,989
and then the reason I bring that up is

360
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:07,029
remember it takes time to move toward a

361
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:09,340
legal marketplace it's not gonna happen

362
00:14:07,029 --> 00:14:11,409
overnight you're gonna have these legal

363
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:14,080
grows you're going to have oversupply of

364
00:14:11,409 --> 00:14:16,509
the system as you come to realize and

365
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:18,370
understand the supply and demand for

366
00:14:16,509 --> 00:14:20,379
that marketplace and it's very difficult

367
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:21,970
for us to deal with but that's the same

368
00:14:20,379 --> 00:14:24,279
crying to you in Washington right now

369
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:27,670
there's an oversupply so we actually

370
00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:29,649
reached out initially when we began we

371
00:14:27,669 --> 00:14:31,299
do nothing it was very little out there

372
00:14:29,649 --> 00:14:33,429
with respect to cannabis remember

373
00:14:31,299 --> 00:14:36,129
Colorado was the only state to have

374
00:14:33,429 --> 00:14:37,659
regulated medical marketplace we even

375
00:14:36,129 --> 00:14:39,850
went to Europe thinking well we're going

376
00:14:37,659 --> 00:14:42,159
to find out how to regulate cannabis in

377
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:44,200
Europe absolutely not no one regulates

378
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:46,360
cannabis in Europe they decriminalize it

379
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:49,960
but there was no one else there but

380
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:52,629
Colorado we spent oops a group of 25 in

381
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:54,879
Washington 25 in Colorado that meant

382
00:14:52,629 --> 00:14:56,769
once every two weeks for hours we

383
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:59,500
learned everything that we could from

384
00:14:56,769 --> 00:15:02,009
Colorado and then we hired dr. mark

385
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:05,340
Kleiman dr. Valle killer with

386
00:15:02,009 --> 00:15:07,080
corporation Motech angela hopkins and

387
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:09,269
jonathan compensator people that are

388
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:11,730
known all over the country as experts

389
00:15:09,269 --> 00:15:14,039
and drug policy around cannabis we hired

390
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:16,080
them in the subcontract with them to

391
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:17,819
help us understand they actually

392
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:19,830
surveyed by city and county and our

393
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:22,950
state what is the consumption rate for

394
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:25,080
cannabis for folks over 21 that's how we

395
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:27,620
built our system to try to make sure

396
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:31,410
that we weren't diverting or oversupply

397
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:33,360
in Washington and it was bumpy to begin

398
00:15:31,409 --> 00:15:35,549
with but we would have never thought

399
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:38,490
after three years of three and a half

400
00:15:35,549 --> 00:15:40,769
years of retail our first year 250

401
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:44,240
million in sales our second year 800

402
00:15:40,769 --> 00:15:49,169
million in sales last year 1.3 billion

403
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:51,570
itself 700 million in excise taxes being

404
00:15:49,169 --> 00:15:54,629
collected for the state give you an

405
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:56,730
example as you heard earlier we were we

406
00:15:54,629 --> 00:15:58,919
were a control state for spirits spirit

407
00:15:56,730 --> 00:16:01,590
cells in 2011 were about 800 million

408
00:15:58,919 --> 00:16:04,289
cannabis sales in Washington a 1.3

409
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:06,360
billion and alcohol sales in Washington

410
00:16:04,289 --> 00:16:08,459
are about 3 billion a year so you could

411
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:11,340
see we'd never in fact that the

412
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:13,740
estimates fiscally for how the industry

413
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:16,320
would grow or what the revenue was was

414
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:19,049
about a third to a half of what we've

415
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,670
collected so it's a robust it's it's a

416
00:16:19,049 --> 00:16:22,819
big industry in Washington I think

417
00:16:20,669 --> 00:16:25,419
finally because we

418
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:28,160
look how long has taken we've ended the

419
00:16:25,419 --> 00:16:30,559
allowance for new licenses for producers

420
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:32,839
processors and retailers that we're

421
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:35,539
actually starting to stabilize as far as

422
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:38,060
sales so I hear two things with that a

423
00:16:35,539 --> 00:16:39,860
lot of tax revenue builds a confidence

424
00:16:38,059 --> 00:16:41,569
in the state to keep that going that tax

425
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:44,090
revenue is put to work in a lot of great

426
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:48,220
ways but quick question for you do you

427
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:51,379
see Washington opening up its can't be

428
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:54,200
limits and or allowing out-of-state in

429
00:16:51,379 --> 00:16:57,080
the near future well I don't see us

430
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:59,480
opening canopy because there's so little

431
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:01,790
surge in Washington last year that

432
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:04,130
there's too much County but the price of

433
00:17:01,789 --> 00:17:05,809
cannabis is now really close to what I

434
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:10,400
showed you this morning Steve is bars

435
00:17:05,809 --> 00:17:13,309
the $6 average per gram and I'm hearing

436
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:15,110
the same concerns in Oregon that I'm

437
00:17:13,309 --> 00:17:17,539
hearing in Washington today so I don't

438
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:20,509
suspect we're gonna open up the canopy

439
00:17:17,539 --> 00:17:22,339
okay Steve your journey as far as the

440
00:17:20,509 --> 00:17:25,129
number of licenses is that what's the

441
00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:27,669
OCC's perspective on how do they help do

442
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:30,530
you let it figure itself out you kept

443
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:33,350
inside the old city doesn't have a

444
00:17:30,529 --> 00:17:36,500
definitive position on calves vs. women

445
00:17:33,349 --> 00:17:38,309
on market line and I personally they

446
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:41,700
were set up to

447
00:17:38,309 --> 00:17:44,639
open market qualifications based I think

448
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:46,759
we should deal with it on that basis I

449
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,810
might be a bit Messier for this agency

450
00:17:46,759 --> 00:17:50,759
enforcement deal because we could

451
00:17:48,809 --> 00:17:53,819
certainly button it out but make a nice

452
00:17:50,759 --> 00:17:57,150
the recreational medical consumer market

453
00:17:53,819 --> 00:18:00,389
inside the OCC with caps and

454
00:17:57,150 --> 00:18:03,000
restrictions policy makers are going to

455
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:05,370
think about that and I think there's a

456
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,799
equitable debate there about which way

457
00:18:05,369 --> 00:18:10,829
in the state could certainly would be a

458
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:13,710
quick easy solution but cap on reward

459
00:18:10,829 --> 00:18:15,269
your foot you know you can take in just

460
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:17,850
those people get into maybe an

461
00:18:15,269 --> 00:18:20,099
auditorium you can put in all this looks

462
00:18:17,849 --> 00:18:22,230
that have submitted a licensure the

463
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:24,329
3,000 and if you give them an

464
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:26,190
opportunity or you can extend it to

465
00:18:24,329 --> 00:18:29,220
these folks that have declared an OHA

466
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:31,380
that come up recently number gets large

467
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:34,850
enough that it's made it was I think the

468
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:37,650
politics crisis to a larger number so

469
00:18:34,849 --> 00:18:39,929
you can't actually be effective even if

470
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:41,550
we do it right here your states are

471
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:43,620
leaning towards a numbing sense of

472
00:18:41,549 --> 00:18:45,629
capital but the market figure that is

473
00:18:43,619 --> 00:18:49,229
not an all attention

474
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:54,320
that's an analysis so one of the things

475
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:56,549
in Washington does it's better data to

476
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:59,519
the market working this is our first

477
00:18:56,549 --> 00:19:01,169
year first major year of production and

478
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:02,730
data is externally proved incredibly

479
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:04,350
helpful for us as we're trying to build

480
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:07,140
their business model so Washington

481
00:19:04,349 --> 00:19:07,709
releases a lot of data Orion is starting

482
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:10,020
to release

483
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:11,460
that data would allow the industry to

484
00:19:10,019 --> 00:19:12,960
analyze the amount of product is being

485
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:15,528
produced and make the strategic business

486
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:17,250
decisions based on that easy Oregon

487
00:19:15,528 --> 00:19:18,538
moving in a direction where they're like

488
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:20,548
we want over these as much data as

489
00:19:18,538 --> 00:19:23,640
possible or no problem flaws around that

490
00:19:20,548 --> 00:19:25,710
one can we reasonably expect it so I

491
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:29,669
think order no I'm sure we're going to

492
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:32,159
move we're all more transparency with

493
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:34,950
our data we're getting better at it the

494
00:19:32,159 --> 00:19:37,020
data segments clean up some - because it

495
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:39,360
was not very meaningful still not

496
00:19:37,019 --> 00:19:42,329
entirely beautiful what we have in the

497
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:46,319
system and today but I hope that we move

498
00:19:42,329 --> 00:19:48,089
in that direction our new chairman Paul

499
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:50,308
Rosenbaum actually has an experience

500
00:19:48,089 --> 00:19:53,609
with a little company this nationwide

501
00:19:50,308 --> 00:19:55,769
the red track that monitors all of your

502
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:58,259
viewing on set-top boxes on TV

503
00:19:55,769 --> 00:20:00,000
understands data really well so I think

504
00:19:58,259 --> 00:20:01,679
you know he needs some time to get in

505
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,130
and experience what he thinks we should

506
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:06,210
be in terms of a data producer and I

507
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:10,200
think we're going to get there and put

508
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:11,610
more and more data out and see that the

509
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:13,710
coming future I don't think we're going

510
00:20:11,609 --> 00:20:16,319
to jump suddenly and do a lot of things

511
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:18,298
because I think we need to work with

512
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:20,339
some Inquirer work with other states

513
00:20:18,298 --> 00:20:22,408
right now because there there's some

514
00:20:20,339 --> 00:20:24,720
parameters as we share data and how we

515
00:20:22,409 --> 00:20:26,700
define it how we look at it that are

516
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:30,028
really helping us think about

517
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:32,490
establishing the long term parameters

518
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:33,740
for best practices of management of

519
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:36,288
marijuana

520
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:38,538
across the country actually in terms of

521
00:20:36,288 --> 00:20:40,308
what our standards are so I wouldn't

522
00:20:38,538 --> 00:20:42,319
expect to see a lot of changes

523
00:20:40,308 --> 00:20:43,879
immediately defend again there are some

524
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:46,220
things we're required to do we have to

525
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:48,950
put out a supplier report we're going to

526
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:51,169
do that before the 19th session so some

527
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:54,230
of the in determined questions we've got

528
00:20:51,169 --> 00:20:56,929
about 4 million pounds of wet weight and

529
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:59,720
maybe when it's a dry three hundred six

530
00:20:56,929 --> 00:21:01,990
hundred and eighty three pounds annually

531
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:04,220
and right away these are numbers that

532
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:05,750
these are estimates that aren't

533
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:08,839
certified estimates right up while

534
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:10,970
working through to figure out how we use

535
00:21:08,839 --> 00:21:13,579
this and what's meaningful in the

536
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:16,278
calculations of information but we're

537
00:21:13,579 --> 00:21:18,528
gonna have to report to the legislature

538
00:21:16,278 --> 00:21:20,509
on the supply it's one thing the federal

539
00:21:18,528 --> 00:21:23,869
government is interested in and seen as

540
00:21:20,509 --> 00:21:26,960
follow through and do is that confusing

541
00:21:23,869 --> 00:21:29,719
part between wet and dry

542
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:32,149
that's pretty confounded how much is

543
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:35,960
going to extracts how much extracts on

544
00:21:32,148 --> 00:21:37,609
extract edibles we've got a growing mark

545
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:40,308
that we have new market entrance coming

546
00:21:37,609 --> 00:21:43,819
in and in Oregon more and more medical

547
00:21:40,308 --> 00:21:46,009
folks are utilizing our system and you

548
00:21:43,819 --> 00:21:48,048
know because of less retail on the

549
00:21:46,009 --> 00:21:50,269
medical side I think we're going to see

550
00:21:48,048 --> 00:21:52,490
there so how much of this can be

551
00:21:50,269 --> 00:21:55,349
consumed what's its ultimate product mix

552
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:57,210
we're gonna get a full cycle you know

553
00:21:55,349 --> 00:22:00,569
coming year which I think we'll have a

554
00:21:57,210 --> 00:22:03,360
good say that set up data to take a look

555
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:06,119
at and we'll be able to see from fall

556
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:10,229
harvest to all the way through the cycle

557
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:11,939
of data how all that harvest translates

558
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:14,160
and the products and supply in our

559
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:16,350
system or to company yeah they're

560
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:18,090
they're legal well it's kind of

561
00:22:16,349 --> 00:22:20,189
interesting that what I've learned is

562
00:22:18,089 --> 00:22:22,439
our public disclosure laws are very

563
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:24,059
different in the States so Washington's

564
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:26,880
referred to as a Sunshine Law which

565
00:22:24,059 --> 00:22:28,230
means there's not much it's protected in

566
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,180
other words the reason why data is

567
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:32,029
available not only in the system but

568
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:34,170
with respect to our licensees

569
00:22:32,029 --> 00:22:36,660
enforcement violations that are issued

570
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:38,789
all of that information is available on

571
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:40,800
our website I'm sure for a lot in the

572
00:22:38,789 --> 00:22:42,960
industry that's concerning but at the

573
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:44,669
same time it makes us better understand

574
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,470
and others understand what our

575
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:48,810
marketplace looks like but a lot of the

576
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:50,670
restrictions I think Oregon's kind of in

577
00:22:48,809 --> 00:22:54,119
the other direction they're looking to

578
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:55,920
protect public information in our state

579
00:22:54,119 --> 00:22:57,899
we don't have much that we can do about

580
00:22:55,920 --> 00:23:00,029
that other than provide that information

581
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:02,460
but as an example that's one of the

582
00:23:00,029 --> 00:23:05,430
reasons why we have that more success in

583
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:07,640
banking is that information our our

584
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:10,830
retailers sign a waiver that allows them

585
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:13,920
allows us to provide the licensing file

586
00:23:10,829 --> 00:23:15,119
to the banks to the credit unions by

587
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,769
doing that we've done a criminal

588
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:19,379
background check we found out a

589
00:23:16,769 --> 00:23:22,109
financial investigation where the money

590
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:24,510
came from that gives or removes some of

591
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:26,729
the anxiety that the banking industry

592
00:23:24,509 --> 00:23:28,710
has in our state because we provide that

593
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:33,509
information they also have the ability

594
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:35,400
ask for a monthly report of any active

595
00:23:33,509 --> 00:23:37,349
what's going on with the licensure close

596
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:40,140
range what's being reported through the

597
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:41,469
traceability system they look at what's

598
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:44,960
happening in the

599
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:47,180
with that particular licensee to make

600
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,620
sure that they can account for it I'll

601
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:50,420
be honest with it I think that's the

602
00:23:48,619 --> 00:23:52,609
biggest reason why we've had success in

603
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:55,100
our state with banking it doesn't seem

604
00:23:52,609 --> 00:23:56,659
like the industry in Washington it seems

605
00:23:55,099 --> 00:23:57,829
like in Oregon were really opposed and

606
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:59,360
we were going through the data and what

607
00:23:57,829 --> 00:24:02,210
was public what was not really really

608
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:04,609
really opposed to it because there is

609
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:06,620
security risk there right but say

610
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:10,969
Washington way that you release the data

611
00:24:06,619 --> 00:24:12,529
is the industry I support I don't know

612
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:14,360
if they'd be angry I'd be concerned

613
00:24:12,529 --> 00:24:15,980
about it because you'd go into our

614
00:24:14,359 --> 00:24:16,808
system we'll find out exactly where at

615
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:19,460
licensing

616
00:24:16,808 --> 00:24:22,220
addresses for example and I can go in

617
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:24,740
there and see what your sales are but I

618
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:26,839
think everybody recognizes because early

619
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:28,339
on we shared that there's not anything

620
00:24:26,839 --> 00:24:29,869
we can do about there hasn't been a

621
00:24:28,339 --> 00:24:32,058
bunch of negative repercussions because

622
00:24:29,869 --> 00:24:33,259
I mean it's not that I'm aware and so

623
00:24:32,058 --> 00:24:34,399
the state of Oregon what are the laws

624
00:24:33,259 --> 00:24:39,490
around like we said the actual

625
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:41,540
disclosure laws what can you and legally

626
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:42,819
primary the big primary thing is

627
00:24:41,539 --> 00:24:44,859
landowner

628
00:24:42,819 --> 00:24:49,000
name affiliation with the property that

629
00:24:44,859 --> 00:24:51,490
protected you know and senators Lansky

630
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,470
get the names of individuals you know

631
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:56,558
not being able to keep records of retail

632
00:24:53,470 --> 00:25:00,429
and individual sales as much so we lost

633
00:24:56,558 --> 00:25:03,099
some data and I'd say we're we're in the

634
00:25:00,429 --> 00:25:05,259
middle we do have to disclose a lot if

635
00:25:03,099 --> 00:25:07,329
you ask us for the records we'll have to

636
00:25:05,259 --> 00:25:09,909
provide them we make an evaluation then

637
00:25:07,329 --> 00:25:12,460
about whether what box needs to be

638
00:25:09,909 --> 00:25:15,250
checked the only ones we consider our

639
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:18,548
security and I'm not sure that I've seen

640
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:24,099
us deny any particular information but

641
00:25:18,548 --> 00:25:25,450
landowner information so there's a lot

642
00:25:24,099 --> 00:25:27,668
available we haven't put it out

643
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:31,470
systemically you're gonna start seeing

644
00:25:27,669 --> 00:25:33,788
more dashboards and compilations of our

645
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:34,240
movement through metric here in the near

646
00:25:33,788 --> 00:25:35,798
future

647
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,720
it's about getting the infrastructure

648
00:25:35,798 --> 00:25:39,730
set up and the ability to get data that

649
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:41,710
makes sense yeah because dry way does

650
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:43,210
not mean a usable way their sticks

651
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:44,950
there's family if everything goes how

652
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:46,120
much about actually is usable that's

653
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:47,980
good data to get dimension so you're

654
00:25:46,119 --> 00:25:54,398
working on it can't do it it will be

655
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:58,808
coming out okay couple minutes left

656
00:25:54,398 --> 00:26:01,479
cool question him how is he OCC dealing

657
00:25:58,808 --> 00:26:03,908
with him getting into the market can

658
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:06,339
talk about that for governance well

659
00:26:03,909 --> 00:26:09,278
now let's say this the last year and a

660
00:26:06,339 --> 00:26:09,798
half I haven't seen and maybe a little

661
00:26:09,278 --> 00:26:12,679
less

662
00:26:09,798 --> 00:26:14,118
last year our final rulemakings I've

663
00:26:12,679 --> 00:26:16,369
been seen many members of the marijuana

664
00:26:14,118 --> 00:26:18,618
community and when we're doing rules I

665
00:26:16,368 --> 00:26:21,230
say the hemp folks in droves

666
00:26:18,618 --> 00:26:24,648
they're concerned they want penetration

667
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:27,769
to the our retail licensing market you

668
00:26:24,648 --> 00:26:31,158
know we started off saying they could

669
00:26:27,769 --> 00:26:33,558
and do the packaging and they expect to

670
00:26:31,159 --> 00:26:35,840
come in and then our rules backed off my

671
00:26:33,558 --> 00:26:37,819
Commission made a decision to let them

672
00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:40,819
in without being in the metric tracking

673
00:26:37,819 --> 00:26:43,220
system new federal requirements were out

674
00:26:40,819 --> 00:26:47,239
there around and then the consumption

675
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:52,190
human human consumption new legislation

676
00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:54,350
was passed so now we come in to our

677
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:56,808
system through processors that's

678
00:26:54,349 --> 00:27:04,009
required by law there's legislation

679
00:26:56,808 --> 00:27:06,259
pending that would allow excuse me the

680
00:27:04,009 --> 00:27:08,569
tracking of marijuana metric right off

681
00:27:06,259 --> 00:27:10,519
of the side he doesn't measure him

682
00:27:08,569 --> 00:27:12,888
coming in it would be entered into

683
00:27:10,519 --> 00:27:17,329
metric you know proceed through subtract

684
00:27:12,888 --> 00:27:20,178
I think that would entail also a clear

685
00:27:17,329 --> 00:27:22,878
stream for him being very distinct

686
00:27:20,179 --> 00:27:25,690
marijuana inside our system may be its

687
00:27:22,878 --> 00:27:28,000
own symbols or lands of packaging

688
00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:31,600
and make it a separate stream this can

689
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:34,869
be a this is a industry problem in the

690
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:36,369
competition we've tended to favor those

691
00:27:34,869 --> 00:27:38,729
that are paying for our systems

692
00:27:36,369 --> 00:27:41,469
marijuana producers of them producers

693
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:44,529
and you know the marijuana producers

694
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:47,319
that they paid the freight on our system

695
00:27:44,529 --> 00:27:49,509
and they have imposed you know who have

696
00:27:47,319 --> 00:27:51,339
met our security requirements on the

697
00:27:49,509 --> 00:27:54,009
ground and producers have an and that

698
00:27:51,339 --> 00:27:55,869
now it's less dangerous maybe that's too

699
00:27:54,009 --> 00:27:57,430
much but they have access to a

700
00:27:55,869 --> 00:28:01,299
completely different market than our

701
00:27:57,430 --> 00:28:03,190
market so it's a we've staked out one

702
00:28:01,299 --> 00:28:05,619
part of the scope I don't think the

703
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:08,620
industry the legislature it one has a

704
00:28:05,619 --> 00:28:10,689
handle on how that's going to come

705
00:28:08,619 --> 00:28:12,669
together in the retail marketplace

706
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:14,650
across the spectrum they have not just

707
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:18,700
been our shops so and it's a difficult

708
00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:21,009
question in a solvent one fell swoop we

709
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:24,250
put a marker in I think everyone's

710
00:28:21,009 --> 00:28:26,529
pivoting off of that but you know we're

711
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:28,960
it's gonna be an enforcement problem for

712
00:28:26,529 --> 00:28:31,539
you to you know this old British is very

713
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:35,980
compounding with our growers marijuana

714
00:28:31,539 --> 00:28:39,519
use is what we're much product and can

715
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:40,930
be exported people are worried about

716
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:44,379
diversion of marijuana

717
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:46,539
and exploitation as possibility it's

718
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:50,110
certainly a lot of bold project looks

719
00:28:46,539 --> 00:28:51,970
the same smells like the same and it

720
00:28:50,109 --> 00:28:55,479
makes protective enforcement so it's

721
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:57,700
gonna be a tough issue so one minute or

722
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:59,230
less we're wrapping up Washington seems

723
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:01,870
okay to talk about him for a minute

724
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:04,539
oh yeah so we don't regulate him the LCB

725
00:29:01,869 --> 00:29:07,389
its Department of Ag but i but i

726
00:29:04,539 --> 00:29:09,220
actually got a kick out of the fact how

727
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:12,280
times are changing this is a shampoo

728
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:15,120
from the Red Lion here on the river and

729
00:29:12,279 --> 00:29:18,210
it says hemp and lemon shampoo

730
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:18,209
[Music]

731
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,170
okay so quick bullet point format once

732
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:28,840
once the focus you know top three focus

733
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:30,300
for Washington then you get to focus on

734
00:29:28,839 --> 00:29:34,329
over the next 12 months

735
00:29:30,299 --> 00:29:36,909
this rule session legislation or is it I

736
00:29:34,329 --> 00:29:38,740
think a couple of rule changes that

737
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:41,680
we're looking at packaging and labeling

738
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:44,289
for example pretty strict regulations

739
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:46,240
initially we're taking a look at that

740
00:29:44,289 --> 00:29:50,139
and coming out in the next probably next

741
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:53,500
month with changes to that make it a

742
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:56,500
little easier for the for the industry I

743
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:59,410
think we're I mean just it's interesting

744
00:29:56,500 --> 00:30:02,079
that's legislated to a day today for the

745
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:04,509
credit unions and in Washington and

746
00:30:02,079 --> 00:30:06,309
they're going up on the hill and one of

747
00:30:04,509 --> 00:30:08,470
the one of the three big issues for them

748
00:30:06,309 --> 00:30:10,509
is continue to have the state assistance

749
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:13,420
and in banking so we're watching that

750
00:30:10,509 --> 00:30:15,640
closely and then we're continuing to

751
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:18,529
work with cities and counties we have

752
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:20,560
bands and more toria's

753
00:30:18,529 --> 00:30:23,180
day and it was pretty problematic

754
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:24,859
initially because the initiative didn't

755
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:27,799
speak to whether cities and counties

756
00:30:24,859 --> 00:30:29,449
could impose bans and oratorios so we

757
00:30:27,799 --> 00:30:32,089
went to the Attorney General I asked for

758
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:34,880
an opinion and unfortunately the opinion

759
00:30:32,089 --> 00:30:37,849
was because the initiative was silent on

760
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:40,040
banzer moratoria cities and counties you

761
00:30:37,849 --> 00:30:43,219
can impose them yet at the same time

762
00:30:40,039 --> 00:30:45,470
they told the LCB because it was silent

763
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:47,269
and then someone meets the licensing

764
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:49,519
requirements which doesn't have anything

765
00:30:47,269 --> 00:30:51,230
to do with bands or moratorium you've

766
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:54,200
got to issue a license in the city and

767
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:56,480
county if a city county imposes a banner

768
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:58,910
moratoria that you can imagine how

769
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:01,670
popular the state was when we issue

770
00:30:58,910 --> 00:31:04,100
licenses in cities and counties that had

771
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:06,830
bands and moratoriums a real frustration

772
00:31:04,099 --> 00:31:09,409
for that and actually we even would have

773
00:31:06,829 --> 00:31:11,779
supported the ability for cities and

774
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:13,430
counties to be able to veto that because

775
00:31:11,779 --> 00:31:15,619
there was so much consternation and

776
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:17,000
people were so upset as far as cities

777
00:31:15,619 --> 00:31:19,579
and counties that we would issue

778
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,680
licenses in defiance of their vans and

779
00:31:19,579 --> 00:31:26,389
were notorious but again the legislature

780
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:28,730
wouldn't move their enforcement training

781
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:31,310
and compliance I mean that's we now

782
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:34,009
we're in that mode now we want to work

783
00:31:31,309 --> 00:31:35,779
with you the Ford in that we will we're

784
00:31:34,009 --> 00:31:37,400
gonna have educational sections on the

785
00:31:35,779 --> 00:31:40,700
new rules that have been adopted the

786
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:42,220
changes could be aware of take the

787
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:44,269
legislative session

788
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:46,309
there's definitely and it's not

789
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:47,059
necessarily with our agency I think

790
00:31:46,309 --> 00:31:50,269
there

791
00:31:47,059 --> 00:31:52,879
and to look at overall unfortunately

792
00:31:50,269 --> 00:31:54,769
resources in the state of Oregon I think

793
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:57,560
the governor and legislature are

794
00:31:54,769 --> 00:31:59,119
interested in that I'm not sure how

795
00:31:57,559 --> 00:32:01,369
they're gonna finance that I don't

796
00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:03,229
particularly think that all that needs

797
00:32:01,369 --> 00:32:06,799
to be financed on the backs of our

798
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:09,200
system are fees and some of that should

799
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:11,539
perhaps come out of the tax dollars were

800
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:13,759
generating you know we've stood up an

801
00:32:11,539 --> 00:32:17,569
industry with you that into this

802
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:19,609
biennium and toll was from my startup to

803
00:32:17,569 --> 00:32:21,230
an analyst with a generator turning 10

804
00:32:19,609 --> 00:32:23,990
million dollars so there's some dollars

805
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:26,000
there to invest in making enforcement

806
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:28,220
system better to invest in making our

807
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,539
services better which is another piece

808
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:31,789
of the equation we got to get our

809
00:32:29,539 --> 00:32:33,740
licensing system working better with our

810
00:32:31,789 --> 00:32:36,259
goals you know where I've been

811
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:41,299
the clinics to make that happen quicker

812
00:32:36,259 --> 00:32:43,009
if you happen redo every day we're

813
00:32:41,299 --> 00:32:46,490
working on the services that we provide

814
00:32:43,009 --> 00:32:49,429
you as well from an IT perspective is a

815
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:51,289
big part of our next lesson okay

816
00:32:49,429 --> 00:32:53,929
well the better funding you guys can get

817
00:32:51,289 --> 00:32:55,220
the smoother the industry will be in the

818
00:32:53,929 --> 00:32:58,100
regulation and the faster we can

819
00:32:55,220 --> 00:33:00,049
continue to move forward so thank you

820
00:32:58,099 --> 00:33:00,689
guys so much for coming thank you for

821
00:33:00,049 --> 00:33:06,769
your time

822
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:06,769
[Applause]
