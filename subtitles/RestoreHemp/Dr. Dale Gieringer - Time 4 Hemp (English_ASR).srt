1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:05,758
thank you for tuning in joining us today

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:09,080
is the leader of California's normal Del

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:11,320
garinger and he has quite a fight on his

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:13,798
hands dealing with a variety of changes

5
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:15,400
that are occurring in his State and with

6
00:00:13,798 --> 00:00:17,079
it being one of the largest states in

7
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:20,039
the United States I think maybe it is

8
00:00:17,079 --> 00:00:23,159
the largest Texas might be in there uh

9
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:24,720
he has uh the need to find more members

10
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,760
and the need to get a message out to the

11
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:29,439
rest of America uh thank you for joining

12
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:32,880
us today um now the politics that

13
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:34,878
California normal focuses on focuses a

14
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,719
lot when it comes to at least the hemp

15
00:00:34,878 --> 00:00:39,320
movement on the medical aspects isn't

16
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,760
that correct well we have with the

17
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:43,558
recent victory in San Francisco with

18
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:46,159
proposition P has put that to the

19
00:00:43,558 --> 00:00:47,759
Forefront the question is what public

20
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:50,718
figures do we have out there who are

21
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:52,920
willing to pick up the ball when 80% of

22
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:55,439
the people of San Francisco say it's

23
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:58,000
time for a change on the issue really

24
00:00:55,439 --> 00:01:00,119
it's amazing how our politicians have

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,640
been pussyfooting about it but I was was

26
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:04,920
very happy to see that the city

27
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,879
officials of San Francisco including the

28
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:12,000
leading candidates for mayor mayor egnos

29
00:01:07,879 --> 00:01:14,920
and former police chief Frank Jordan and

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,239
other City officials have expressed

31
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:20,079
nothing but support for proposition p

32
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:22,798
and not only that we found that by

33
00:01:20,078 --> 00:01:25,199
putting proposition P out there we were

34
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:28,079
able to give them an issue that they

35
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,439
felt good about supporting that they

36
00:01:28,078 --> 00:01:32,559
didn't have to run and hide from now I

37
00:01:30,438 --> 00:01:34,839
think it's time to bring that out to

38
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,478
some of the other uh leaders in

39
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:39,560
California particularly in the

40
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:40,438
legislature and in Congress and get the

41
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:44,519
ball

42
00:01:40,438 --> 00:01:47,438
rolling now uh you've come out to uh

43
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:49,399
nation's capital uh shortly after was

44
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:50,959
only been like 3 4 days since prop P

45
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:52,640
passed hasn't been very long it's been a

46
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:54,399
week yeah going be a week so you've

47
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,960
arrived here just as quickly as the

48
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:59,200
message that that message that that that

49
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:00,519
proposal being passed sent to to our

50
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,719
nation's capital

51
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:04,280
how do you think Congress and the Senate

52
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:06,118
is starting to react to this you think

53
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:08,199
it's going to take the attention of

54
00:02:06,118 --> 00:02:10,199
national candidates and it will be it

55
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:13,839
remains to be it's up to us we're going

56
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:15,479
to actually have to go to Capitol Hill

57
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,039
where I was the other day and I'm going

58
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:20,119
again on Monday and I think other people

59
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:23,199
have to be doing that too talking to

60
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:25,239
their Congress people and urging them to

61
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:27,639
take a position on this issue in fact

62
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:29,560
one of the key leaders in all of

63
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:31,598
Congress and among the Democrats on the

64
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,598
issue of medical marijuana is an

65
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:38,079
important legislator from California

66
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:41,039
Henry Waxman from Los Angeles who has uh

67
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:45,120
I must say had a very good record in in

68
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:47,919
voting against uh repressive drug

69
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,519
legislation uh he's been in a minority a

70
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:52,518
very small minority of people who have

71
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:54,519
opposed who've actually voted no on

72
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:58,759
these crime bills that come down like

73
00:02:54,519 --> 00:03:02,759
the latest ninus crime Bill uh and he is

74
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:07,238
also uh the head of the health and

75
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:09,919
environment subcommittee that deals with

76
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:13,400
uh how what Got Drugs how drugs get

77
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:15,119
regulated FDA drugs and Health and Human

78
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:18,080
Services which is making the decision on

79
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:21,680
medical marijuana I think it behooves us

80
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:23,400
to tell to to to tell Mr Waxman I hope

81
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:27,760
his constituents will tell him that they

82
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:30,158
would appreciate it uh if he started uh

83
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:32,840
call holding hearings on the issue of

84
00:03:30,158 --> 00:03:35,280
medical marijuana uh because I I think

85
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:38,878
by doing so uh he would have the

86
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:41,080
opportunity to really uh uh score some

87
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:44,120
important some important points that

88
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:46,040
have to be scored and uh affect some

89
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:48,480
change very quickly because there will

90
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:50,639
be popular support for this and there's

91
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:54,560
no reason that he shouldn't uh undertake

92
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:57,839
it so we we hope that people will talk

93
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:00,920
to Waxman and others urging this kind of

94
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,479
thing okay now you and I being together

95
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:04,479
from California I'm not native there I'm

96
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:06,840
native from Indiana but I spent the last

97
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:09,479
four or five years living in the state

98
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:12,360
know that uh smoke a joint lose your

99
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:15,639
license seems to have some importance to

100
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:17,000
that state and we are we got to deal

101
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:19,759
with that that's right it's on the

102
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,720
agenda California has got to act on

103
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:24,919
smoke a joint lose your license by

104
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:26,600
October 1993 or we start losing Federal

105
00:04:24,918 --> 00:04:29,240
Highway funds can they do what can they

106
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:31,439
do well we've got two options we either

107
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:33,478
an smoke a joint lose your license which

108
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:36,160
is an automatic six-month driving

109
00:04:33,478 --> 00:04:37,839
license suspension for any drug offense

110
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,520
any drug offense including personal

111
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:42,079
possession of marijuana regardless of

112
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:47,120
whether it's on the road or not

113
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:50,918
or we can reject it by a joint

114
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:54,800
resolution of the legislature and the

115
00:04:50,918 --> 00:04:56,839
governor okay now the legislature does

116
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,800
not care for smoke a joint L your

117
00:04:56,839 --> 00:05:02,038
license as does the majority of

118
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:04,240
California public and all informed

119
00:05:02,038 --> 00:05:07,240
opinion in California the Sacramento B

120
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:09,800
the San Jose Mercury have editorialized

121
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:12,800
against this uh there's nobody I've

122
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:14,918
heard yet who's spoken up in favor of it

123
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,120
other than I believe the Orange County

124
00:05:14,918 --> 00:05:19,839
Board of Supervisors so then why is it

125
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,199
still in existence but we have

126
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:23,879
because the legislature has to get

127
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:26,319
agreement from the governor on what to

128
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:27,560
do now we have a governor who announced

129
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:30,600
that he was in favor of Rec

130
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:32,759
criminalizing Marijuana and so the

131
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:35,199
universal assumption has been well gee

132
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:37,919
Pete Wilson is going to veto any attempt

133
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:41,120
to pass an override resolution to smoke

134
00:05:37,918 --> 00:05:43,000
a joint Los your license uh we think

135
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,600
that Pete Wilson's position is very ill

136
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,319
informed he really hasn't thought

137
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,960
through the costs of this proposal

138
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:50,000
because you're going to have thousands

139
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:52,198
tens of thousands of marijuana offenders

140
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,918
who now you know get a ticket for

141
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:56,439
smoking a joint in the park are going to

142
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:57,758
be coming you fighting driver's license

143
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:59,519
suspension I mean they're going to get

144
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,439
lawyers they're going to get trials

145
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:02,839
public defenders I mean this is going to

146
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:05,639
cost the state tens of millions of

147
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:08,239
dollars and it is so stupid everyone

148
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:09,918
realizes it is so stupid to give six

149
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,360
months driver's license suspension for

150
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:14,639
somebody who has a joint in their purse

151
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:16,520
uh in the airport and and yet you can

152
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,960
drive drunk and get only a four Monon

153
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:19,719
driver's license suspension in

154
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:22,359
California I mean which is worse really

155
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:24,400
yeah but if they enact the uh the tax

156
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:28,080
situation that they've got on the uh

157
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:30,000
marijuana or oh with the tax issues is a

158
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:32,120
separate issue whether they should also

159
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,038
put a penalty tax on that's been beaten

160
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:37,000
back and I don't expect it to come back

161
00:06:34,038 --> 00:06:38,719
we we did have to fight it uh Senator

162
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,199
Davis had a proposal in which he's head

163
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,280
in for many years to put a controlled

164
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:45,038
substances tax on so if they catch you

165
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:47,000
with drugs of any kind they could say

166
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:49,839
all right well you didn't pay the tax

167
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:53,160
and the tax was going to be $500 per

168
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:56,878
ounce $500 per ounce of crack $500 per

169
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:59,879
ounce of LSD $500 per ounce of marijuana

170
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:02,879
but they W $500 was not really what

171
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:04,720
you'd pay because that was the tax only

172
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:06,439
if you paid it in advance if they caught

173
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,199
you not having paid it which is what

174
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:10,598
they fully expected then there would be

175
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:13,439
a penalty and it would be $55,000 an

176
00:07:10,598 --> 00:07:15,360
ounce you see and Ed Davis admitted

177
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:17,759
himself this is just another way of

178
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,439
expanding the state's forfeiture Powers

179
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,919
all right so that if there's a lot of we

180
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:24,839
can get the guys money uh and this

181
00:07:21,918 --> 00:07:27,719
passed the Senate unanimously in

182
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:29,918
California uh a lot of senators voted

183
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:31,520
for it knowing it was a bad Bill

184
00:07:29,918 --> 00:07:34,000
thinking that the assembly would knock

185
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:35,918
it down which it has in previous years

186
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,519
unfortunately it got loose in the

187
00:07:35,918 --> 00:07:39,279
assembly it didn't go through the same

188
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:42,318
legislative channels it did last year

189
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:45,918
and it almost passed but we were able to

190
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:47,840
alert the the important decision makers

191
00:07:45,918 --> 00:07:50,038
about that and it got scotched at the

192
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:53,679
last minute and I don't think it's going

193
00:07:50,038 --> 00:07:56,759
to make it but this shows the importance

194
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:59,959
of watching

195
00:07:56,759 --> 00:08:02,360
your public policy makers your decision

196
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:05,239
makers your city council these proposals

197
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:07,879
come up and if you aren't aware of them

198
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:09,759
I mean they can sail right through but

199
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:12,439
when you say something you can have an

200
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:14,400
impact okay that's it too you say we

201
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:16,038
have an impact okay I'm calling you from

202
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:17,839
Los Angeles and I want to know what can

203
00:08:16,038 --> 00:08:20,598
I do to stop this what can I do as an

204
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:23,359
individual well from Los Angeles uh

205
00:08:20,598 --> 00:08:26,680
first of all if you haven't done so

206
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:29,919
already please write to your state

207
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:31,560
senator and your State Assembly

208
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:32,679
okay look them up in the phone Booker

209
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,479
from your Board of Elections if you

210
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:38,239
don't know who they are and write to

211
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:40,080
them saying to vote against smoke a

212
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,719
joint lose your license and to support

213
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,639
an override and then what and also write

214
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,760
a letter to Pete Wilson which was going

215
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:48,639
to be ignored and probably put in a big

216
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:51,200
pile of letters and Wade or something

217
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:53,159
like that but do it anyhow that's right

218
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,440
because if they get lots of tons of mail

219
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:57,199
I mean nothing else it does make a state

220
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,839
well let me say state legislators don't

221
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,320
get all that mail on a lot of issues I

222
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:03,320
mean 101 the gay rights issue got a lot

223
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,879
of mail but often they'll only have you

224
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,240
know four or five letters on a

225
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:08,200
particular Bill what else can we do

226
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:11,278
that'll make a difference all right the

227
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:13,640
other thing you can do is go out and

228
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:15,838
when you meet candidates uh like at

229
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:18,360
candidates nights you know when the your

230
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:21,480
local Congressman comes in town and has

231
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:23,240
a public meeting ask him his stand on

232
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:26,480
that law on smoke a joint lose your

233
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:29,759
license ask him his stand on medical

234
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:31,759
marijuana uh you know you might even ask

235
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:33,559
whether people have a right Americans

236
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:36,399
have a right to smoke marijuana in the

237
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:38,078
privacy of their personal lives okay uh

238
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,440
I wouldn't ask them to take a position

239
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:42,599
on legalization no politician is going

240
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:44,320
to say yes to that at this particular

241
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:46,040
moment so let's not waste our breath but

242
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,800
let's focus on what's at hand it's

243
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:49,639
medical marijuana it's smoke a joint

244
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:51,439
lose your license and we'll talk about

245
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:53,679
more of that when we come back right

246
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:56,760
after this with us today is the head of

247
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:58,799
California normal Dell garinger Dell we

248
00:09:56,759 --> 00:10:00,200
have some elections coming up in 1992 we

249
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:01,879
always have elections coming up but the

250
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:05,440
candidates in ' 92 are the ones that

251
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:07,759
we're focusing on primarily now as an as

252
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,640
a voter who's concerned about getting

253
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:11,480
the prop the propositions that we need

254
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:13,319
taken care of and into office and

255
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,959
implemented I want to be able to find

256
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,600
out how my candidate votes I want to be

257
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:19,278
able to find out his background I want

258
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,720
to be able to find out how I can make a

259
00:10:19,278 --> 00:10:23,879
difference when I get ready to cast my

260
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:26,639
ballot well join California normal and

261
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:28,679
California normal reports makes a point

262
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:31,360
of giving you the information about how

263
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:33,039
people voting and we've been following

264
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,639
people that very interesting votes have

265
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:36,639
been occurring in California and people

266
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:38,439
are not very aware of them I think the

267
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:39,879
smoke a joint lose your license vote was

268
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:42,279
a particularly interesting one this was

269
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:44,958
a vote that was taken by Congress to

270
00:10:42,278 --> 00:10:47,039
force the states to change their laws it

271
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:50,000
was specifically aimed at marijuana

272
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:52,799
decriminalization by Bill Bennett and

273
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,039
and Senator alfons deato and

274
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:58,519
representative Jerry Solomon well-known

275
00:10:55,039 --> 00:11:01,078
right-wing reactionaries from back there

276
00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:02,759
who voted for it in California well most

277
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:04,319
of all the Republicans did with the

278
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:08,000
exception of Tom Campbell who's running

279
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:10,879
for Senate um a lot of the Democrats did

280
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,399
too though uh including some supposedly

281
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:15,919
very liberal ones a notable one being

282
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:18,600
Barbara Boxer who is running for Senate

283
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:20,519
also the same senate seat uh from San

284
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:22,879
Francisco and Barbara Boxer fancies

285
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:24,480
herself to be an advocate of civil

286
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:26,078
rights and personal freedom and

287
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,360
abortions rights and our right to

288
00:11:26,078 --> 00:11:31,399
control our own body and she makes a

289
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:33,399
very for show of being pro-choice but

290
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:35,559
when you ask her about marijuana she

291
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:37,720
says well you know I don't think it

292
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:39,119
should be legal and I don't think people

293
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:42,160
should go to jail but it shouldn't be

294
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:44,759
legal to use it and uh she defends her

295
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:48,078
vote on smoke a joint loser L your

296
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:49,679
license uh and on no particularly good

297
00:11:48,078 --> 00:11:51,638
rational grounds she's basically a

298
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:53,559
prohibitionist she doesn't like drugs at

299
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:56,639
all she said she'd like alcohol to be

300
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:58,399
illegal if you know if if that would

301
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:00,399
help things out well it sounds more to

302
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:02,879
me like she's is trying to stop personal

303
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:05,159
rights right well we tried so we so we

304
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:06,919
told I mean the obvious contradiction

305
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:09,078
here is here's somebody who says she's

306
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:11,120
pro-choice she's pro-abortion she's not

307
00:12:09,078 --> 00:12:14,278
pro-choice and we confronted her with

308
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:16,360
that at a couple of fundraisers for her

309
00:12:14,278 --> 00:12:19,639
where we approached her and we the

310
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:21,839
people in in her campaign are people who

311
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:24,360
are very are friends of ours okay they

312
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:26,440
agree with us on these issues uh they

313
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:28,399
don't know that Barbara Boxer had this

314
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:30,279
position until we went up to the in the

315
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:33,519
Democratic convention in Oakland and

316
00:12:30,278 --> 00:12:35,600
talk to them uh to fundraisers and talk

317
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:38,879
to them said do you know how Barbara

318
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,959
Boxer is on uh marijuana in fact an

319
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:43,600
incident that happened just a couple

320
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:46,319
months ago before the recent tragic

321
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:49,839
death of Bill Graham Bill

322
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:53,440
Graham had a fundraiser uh for Barbara

323
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:57,959
Boxer up at his beautiful Marin home

324
00:12:53,440 --> 00:13:00,160
which is a psychedelic Museum of uh uh I

325
00:12:57,958 --> 00:13:02,559
I'm I'm just thrill that I was able to

326
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:05,838
see and I'm I'm glad I met Bill Graham

327
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:08,319
too before he before he passed away uh

328
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:11,800
but I went up there along with Ed

329
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:14,519

330
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:16,719
bucks to get in we had we got a nice

331
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:18,240

332
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,079
circulated and talked about things I

333
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:23,399
went up the barber boxer introduced

334
00:13:20,078 --> 00:13:25,000
myself tried to tried to tried to make

335
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:26,639
overtures and she said well she didn't

336
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,240
agree with us on the marijuana issue

337
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:32,120
blah blah blah and so we went and talked

338
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:34,039
to Bill Graham and Ed Rosenthal button

339
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:36,360
hold him and we told Bill Graham the

340
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:39,639
story and Bill Graham said what Barbara

341
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:41,320
Boxer doesn't understand weed why that's

342
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:45,240
an important issue I'll have to tell her

343
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:47,959
about it and sure enough the afternoon

344
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:50,720
went on Barbara Boxer gave a speech in

345
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:52,278
which he went on about civil liberties

346
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,839
and everything else said wonderful

347
00:13:52,278 --> 00:13:54,919
things I I had to agree with everything

348
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:57,160
she said in her speech she never

349
00:13:54,919 --> 00:14:00,319
mentioned drugs uh went on to a

00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:22,000
happened Bill Graham finally came up to

360
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:25,600
say what he had to say and it was very

361
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:29,120
simple he said well look I really agree

362
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:30,519
with 99% of Barbara boxer's position but

363
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,480
I have to say there's one thing I

364
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:34,879
disagree with her on you know I don't

365
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,560
want to talk about drugs but it's been

366
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:38,600
500 years since we came to this

367
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:42,239
continent and people still aren't free

368
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:44,920
to plant the seed that's right so now do

369
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,919
we have some kind of Lobby going in Cal

370
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:49,559
do we have a well is normal involved

371
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:52,278
with the lobby I try to do that and I

372
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:54,599
have friends and and there's a network

373
00:14:52,278 --> 00:14:56,799
of people who who work on particular

374
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:59,079
representatives in some it's all it's

375
00:14:56,799 --> 00:15:00,799
all volunteer but we have phone trees

376
00:14:59,078 --> 00:15:03,239
which need to be developed especially I

377
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:06,439
would say in southern californ uh so

378
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:08,399
that we can get we can get calls through

379
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:10,480
to a legislator's office if a key vote

380
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:11,879
is going on and saying hey we care about

381
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,159
this vote because that's an important

382
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:16,639
thing to do if if smoke a joint lose

383
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:18,559
your license comes to a vote we want

384
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:20,399
people phoning the Senate Judiciary

385
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:22,559
Committee on the day of that vote and

386
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:24,480
we'll to let people know when that comes

387
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:26,719
but yeah because often times the people

388
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,879
that are making these statements and

389
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,680
making these policies have a mult a

390
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:32,559
million dooll budget to work with for

391
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:34,919
their campaigns and are able to have you

392
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:36,359
know press releases put together for

393
00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:37,838
them and so on and the people who are

394
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:39,600
opposing these particular viewpoints are

395
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:41,560
coming from their heart they Working

396
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,399
Class Heroes and are working on a budget

397
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:44,838
so we need to find some way to work

398
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:46,759
together what do you suggest when it

399
00:15:44,839 --> 00:15:48,959
comes to that state of size of

400
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:52,318
California how would you pull us

401
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:55,758
together uh that's a real tall order and

402
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:57,719
we're a a long way from having a single

403
00:15:55,759 --> 00:16:00,199
organization as you're aware there's a

404
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:01,360
network of of groups in California that

405
00:16:00,198 --> 00:16:05,838
I think we're just going to have to keep

406
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:07,839
developing for a while uh I see you know

407
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:10,600
many different people working in many

408
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:12,639
different places it's on really it's a

409
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:14,680
county bycount basis and different

410
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:17,120
Counties have their expertise and I try

411
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:19,439
to handle Sacramento Affairs and you

412
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,120
know press relations and stuff like that

413
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:25,440
for the and keep people informed through

414
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:28,198
the newsletter uh as for you know more

415
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:30,800
developed organization time we'll bring

416
00:16:28,198 --> 00:16:32,919
that it won't we may not even need it

417
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:35,359
but it is important for us to to get

418
00:16:32,919 --> 00:16:37,278
actively involved now how is it that

419
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:40,159
normal makes it its policies when it

420
00:16:37,278 --> 00:16:42,838
comes to supporting various uh groups

421
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:44,240
and various uh proposals and amendments

422
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:45,399
going through the state how is it that

423
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,600
you make your selections there's an

424
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:49,159
awful lot going on out there there's not

425
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,759
that many issues that are strictly

426
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:52,519
marijuana there's usually about two or

427
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:54,759
three bills a year in the legislature

428
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:58,198
that really deal with marijuana usually

429
00:16:54,759 --> 00:17:00,440
it's status quo all right and basically

430
00:16:58,198 --> 00:17:02,479
we get in there to try to oppose bad

431
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:04,199
stuff and there every year there's a bad

432
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,640
Bill a couple years ago for instance

433
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:08,519
there was a bill by when Vamp was still

434
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:11,079
attorney general they wanted to

435
00:17:08,519 --> 00:17:13,359
establish 10 plants as the absolute

436
00:17:11,078 --> 00:17:14,759
limit for personal use cultivation so

437
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:17,078
anybody who was caught with more more

438
00:17:14,759 --> 00:17:18,838
than 10 plants is an automatic felon not

439
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:20,078
eligible for diversion regardless of

440
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:21,438
whether they're a medical patient or

441
00:17:20,078 --> 00:17:22,838
whatever and everybody who knows

442
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:25,038
anything about cultivation knows that's

443
00:17:22,838 --> 00:17:29,000
completely unrealistic and not what

444
00:17:25,038 --> 00:17:31,079
personal use is and uh

445
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,880
basically we're the only people who know

446
00:17:31,079 --> 00:17:35,960
about personal use the legislature

447
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:38,200
doesn't and neither does law enforcement

448
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:39,720
and so by going to the legislature and

449
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:41,279
just talking to the people who are

450
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,440
sponsoring this bill and explaining well

451
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:43,960
look this has nothing to do with

452
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:45,600
personal use you're going to get into

453
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:48,400
all sorts of lawsuits on this sort of

454
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:50,240
thing this is unreasonable uh debunking

455
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,080
the statistics they had a cop come in

456
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,720
and try to say that one plant grows a

457
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:56,639
kilogram of marijuana well yes one plant

458
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,960
on a government marijuana farm with no

459
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,480
helicopters above it may grow kilogram

460
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,159
of marijuana but we know that's not the

461
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,480
way marijuana is grown we said that we

462
00:18:03,159 --> 00:18:06,720
convinced the committee it wasn't hard

463
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:10,759
to do because we did have the facts on

464
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:14,440
this so bills like that you know don't

465
00:18:10,759 --> 00:18:17,240
come around that often okay um now when

466
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:19,519
it comes to uh focusing your energies

467
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:21,120
too you have to be very select in the

468
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:23,200
type of people that you send as front

469
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:26,079
people and at the same time you're also

470
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:29,720
focusing on groups and the muscle behind

471
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:31,558
that uh who does uh does most of the

472
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:34,200
structuring throughout the state I know

473
00:18:31,558 --> 00:18:35,879
you you had it up uh how is it organized

474
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,798
is it done by large cities is there a

475
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:39,799
lot of people like an LA it's a network

476
00:18:37,798 --> 00:18:43,079
it's a network of people uh that we

477
00:18:39,798 --> 00:18:45,400
phone okay um not all of whom are

478
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:48,918
official members of California normal

479
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:50,880
which has a very indefinite struct uh uh

480
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:53,600
indefinite structure is not right we do

481
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,200
have bylaws but the we're probably going

482
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:57,639
to have some reorganization of our own

483
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,279
just as National normal is but we've got

484
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:02,360
about a minute

485
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:04,440
and if you had the opportunity to say

486
00:19:02,359 --> 00:19:06,678
one thing that was most important to the

487
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:08,640
California citizens as well as those

488
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:11,880
people across America who are seeing

489
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:16,360
this what would be your statement well I

490
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:18,440
think you have to really demand of your

491
00:19:16,359 --> 00:19:21,359
Congress people and your elected

492
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:23,960
