1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:08,558
well about four years ago in

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:12,040
2010 uh Ben had noticed some lumps he

3
00:00:08,558 --> 00:00:14,160
had on his posterior um being a former

4
00:00:12,039 --> 00:00:17,439
naturopathic physician's

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,600
assistant he could kind of almost

6
00:00:17,439 --> 00:00:22,439
predict that it might be cancer but he

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:25,800
wasn't quite sure he got blown off by

8
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:29,000
his family doctor he wasn't uh going to

9
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,759
give us a referral so he told them it

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,799
was a calcium deposit don't worry about

11
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:36,960
it but he was already growing some

12
00:00:33,799 --> 00:00:41,959
marijuana for the purpose of um dealing

13
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:45,239
with his uh his uh heart condition um

14
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:47,160
kind of keeping his blood pressure at a

15
00:00:45,238 --> 00:00:48,198
at a rate where it would give him a

16
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:50,359
little bit of

17
00:00:48,198 --> 00:00:53,759
energy and uh kind of turn off the

18
00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:57,359
gravity amplifier he'd been watching um

19
00:00:53,759 --> 00:01:00,238
YouTube he saw the YouTube show on um I

20
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:01,960
guess the the Rick Simpson story ah and

21
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:07,239
when he learned about that run from the

22
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:09,560
Cure and so he uh he decided to apply

23
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:13,399
that just thinking you know this might

24
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:14,600
this this lump might be uh cancer and he

25
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,799
applied it and he thought well if it's

26
00:01:14,599 --> 00:01:19,519
not let's just see what it does well he

27
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,680
had a golf ball sized well he found out

28
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:25,039
later it was a tumor uh and after

29
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:27,640
applying it topically for within about

30
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,920
two months it shrank down to the size of

31
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:31,879
a well down to a little pink spot I mean

32
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:35,759
I mean it it uh went below the surface

33
00:01:31,879 --> 00:01:38,879
of a skin and disappeared So eventually

34
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,759
um someone must have called the police

35
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:45,000
thinking they smelled marijuana in our

36
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:49,159
apartment and uh and so we were raided

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,040
and he had he had shown the the police

38
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:52,880
officer what he had been using the

39
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:57,079
marijuana for that he was making

40
00:01:52,879 --> 00:02:00,239
cannabis oil and he even uh even showed

41
00:01:57,078 --> 00:02:03,438
him you know uh how he applied it before

42
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:07,399
he confiscated it before the the officer

43
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:10,118
Furlong detective Furlong confiscated it

44
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:14,199
um so we were arrested we went through a

45
00:02:10,118 --> 00:02:15,959
year of um basically firing attorneys

46
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:18,399
trying to get someone who would

47
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:22,759
represent us and not force us to plea

48
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:24,560
out and then eventually um we just gave

49
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:27,199
up on that and went ahead and took a

50
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,878
guilty plea of manufacturing he wanted

51
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:30,958
to present a medical defense no one was

52
00:02:29,878 --> 00:02:33,000
was going to hear it and they just

53
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,878
weren't going to go with it so we've

54
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,800
been we had been on probation for a

55
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:41,158
couple of years um during the the first

56
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:45,040
couple of months uh in

57
00:02:41,158 --> 00:02:46,439
2011 he had gone to um finally got a

58
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:50,239
referral to an

59
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:52,280
oncologist who came back with a result

60
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:55,840
um after giving him a biopsy that it was

61
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:57,800
in fact angio sarcoma cancer it is a

62
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:01,759
cancer of the in lining of the blood

63
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:04,719
vessels which appears as uh tumors on

64
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:06,239
the skin above the the surface of the

65
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:08,318
skin

66
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:12,120
and

67
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:14,079
so while on probation Ben decided to

68
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:16,840
just try to get a hold of whatever plant

69
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,760
material he could um sometimes ditch

70
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:21,039
weed friends would Harvest some out of

71
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:24,280
the field you know in Iowa it just grows

72
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:26,079
everywhere um and he would make uh can

73
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,878
cannabis oil out of that sometimes he

74
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,560
had to go to the street to buy cannabis

75
00:03:27,878 --> 00:03:32,840
oil but eventually you he was able to

76
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,039
acquire just enough for a you know a

77
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:38,479
couple of grams here or there um he

78
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:40,519
would ingest them and he was he was able

79
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:41,798
to keep the tumors from growing and some

80
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:44,640
of them would even shrink you know some

81
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:47,280
of the smaller ones especially now this

82
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:50,399
went on for well about two and a half

83
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,878
years and then in June

84
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:57,200
2013 well I'm I'm getting ahead of

85
00:03:52,878 --> 00:04:00,158
myself uh he started growing cannabis in

86
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:04,238
a trailer in the backyard um his best

87
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:07,438
friend helped him and uh he had all uh

88
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:11,200
higher CBD strains I think he had um

89
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:14,719
canonic which I think came from some z7s

90
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:19,399
uh seeds um that he' ordered from Mr

91
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:22,918
Nice I think mhm and so he had uh he had

92
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:24,959
plants that were you know eventually

93
00:04:22,918 --> 00:04:27,519
going to possibly you know if he could

94
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:29,839
acquire enough uh he could make enough

95
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:31,399
oil to maybe wipe out this cancer cuz at

96
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:32,638
this point it was at stage one they were

97
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:37,038
really small

98
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:40,360
tumors well and then 2013 June of 20

99
00:04:37,038 --> 00:04:45,959
2013 um we were raided and they brought

100
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:49,720
about 20 SWAT agents uh in at 5:45 a.m.

101
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:52,279
to the house um banging on the door

102
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:54,160
screaming uh I was the first one to the

103
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:57,959
door and I

104
00:04:54,160 --> 00:05:00,199
had about well about six agents pointing

105
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:03,839
you know some pretty high power

106
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:07,000
uh Weaponry in my face um so you know it

107
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:09,159
kind of scared the crap out of all of us

108
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,800
um I can imagine actually I've been in

109
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:13,759
that situation myself so well I know

110
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:16,199
what that's like yeah and and his

111
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:19,400
elderly parents were

112
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:21,960
upstairs you know it it uh kind of it

113
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:23,879
shocked them um there was just the five

114
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:26,120
of us living there so they ended up

115
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:30,000
Prosecuting all five of you though they

116
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:32,959
did the parents your son mhm both of

117
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,360
view yeah that's just outrageous yeah

118
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:36,439
you know that's what they do is they

119
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:38,479
they try to pile on as many charges as

120
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:40,918
they possibly can so they can then

121
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:43,120
manipulate you to do what they want you

122
00:05:40,918 --> 00:05:44,799
to do like we're going to torture your

123
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,478
wife and your son and your parents if

124
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,720
you don't do exactly what we say to do

125
00:05:47,478 --> 00:05:50,839
you know it's

126
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,759
disgusting you know that our law

127
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:55,079
enforcement has has turned to this it's

128
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:58,319
really the prosecutors and the police

129
00:05:55,079 --> 00:06:02,359
are in charge of the whole system and

130
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:05,400
choosing how to charge you and uh uh

131
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:08,560
make you you know dance to their tune or

132
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:11,439
else right yeah it appeared that way

133
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:13,160
I they uh they didn't arrest his parents

134
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:16,240
but they did charge them with operating

135
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:17,680
a drug housee kind of makes it sound how

136
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,240
parents

137
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:23,400
Bon

138
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:27,120
they 70 they are um respectively I think

139
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:29,758
70 at the time they were 76 and 77 years

140
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,519
old that's so Benton I just got a let

141
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:33,080
our audience know you you've been the

142
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:35,839
recipient of some

143
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:37,800
beneficial cannabis oil here in Oregon

144
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:39,598
as a legal medical marijuana patient I'm

145
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:42,240
proud to say that you know we were able

146
00:06:39,598 --> 00:06:44,279
to help you get that medical marijuana

147
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:47,918
permit and have helped you out with some

148
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:51,079
medicine in the past but yeah I know but

149
00:06:47,918 --> 00:06:53,038
right now you're on a pretty big dose of

150
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:57,439
of uh RSO

151
00:06:53,038 --> 00:07:00,199
oil do yeah yeah six grams a day that's

152
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:01,680
a lot that six grams is in fact I don't

153
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:04,240
think I've ever heard of anybody taking

154
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,720
six grams in a single day so yeah that's

155
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:09,400
a lot I figured you vaporized twice that

156
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:13,440
much you would think so but no no it's

157
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:17,038
not true maybe I wish I could uh well

158
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:18,879
half my right lung is full of tumors I

159
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:21,120
just found out so now that cancer is

160
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:24,080
metastasized to your lungs and where

161
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:27,319
else in my liver your liver and your

162
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:30,719
lungs and so you've just been convicted

163
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:33,240
when about 10 days ago

164
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:36,599
uh just about two weeks ago yeah about

165
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:39,160
two weeks ago and so fortunately you

166
00:07:36,598 --> 00:07:43,598
with a bond the state has allowed you to

167
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:46,599
come here and visit Oregon a few times M

168
00:07:43,598 --> 00:07:48,319
right yeah so they yeah they started

169
00:07:46,598 --> 00:07:51,800
letting me come here so I could survive

170
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:54,800
to make it to the end of trial right I

171
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:57,079
could good point you want to go on with

172
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,560
the story Loretta and what happened sure

173
00:07:57,079 --> 00:08:03,598
well when we were arrested um his

174
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:06,280
parents had bonded us out um but a

175
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:08,360
couple of weeks later uh because we'd

176
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:11,399
been on probation our probation

177
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:15,080
officers uh issued warrants for our

178
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:18,399
arrest again so back to jail we went uh

179
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:22,598
this time there was a $5,000 cash only

180
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:25,758
Bond held over both of us and so his

181
00:08:22,598 --> 00:08:28,000
parents being you know broke completely

182
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:30,280
unable to get us out they couldn't do

183
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:35,038
anything about it we uh ended up staying

184
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:37,639
there well he stayed in for 40 days um

185
00:08:35,038 --> 00:08:38,918
he was uh he was constantly trying to

186
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:41,080
draw to the attention of the medical

187
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:46,600
staff his tumors which were starting to

188
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:48,320
grow um without anything um and I've got

189
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,519
to say that I've seen some pictures of

190
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,600
your tumors

191
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:55,799
online and I just very sorry that you

192
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:59,200
have to endure such painful lesions they

193
00:08:55,799 --> 00:09:02,000
they look uh like look pretty bad I've

194
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:04,560
seen seen some other people with saroma

195
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:08,600
back before they had the antiviral

196
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:10,759
agents when people were dying from AIDS

197
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:13,360
yeah kind of reminded me of that it's a

198
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:14,919
similar kind of cancer isn't it yeah I

199
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,839
imagine it's very simil I think it's it

200
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:19,000
might be the same form that ended up

201
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:22,000
killing so many AIDS patients as you

202
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,600
have a compromised immune system that

203
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,240
too my uh immune system is not quite as

204
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:29,639
compromised as it could they probably

205
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:31,919
should be actually but you've got this

206
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:34,439
this rare form of cancer so you want to

207
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:39,439
tell us about the trial uh

208
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:42,200
Loretta yes um well we it's taken

209
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:45,399
several months since uh we got out of

210
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:48,879
jail um we had uh pretty good

211
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:50,399
representation uh each of us um they had

212
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:53,159
a lot of different things that they

213
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:54,679
wanted to do um they wanted to try to

214
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:56,879
see if they could get all of the

215
00:09:54,679 --> 00:10:00,159
evidence suppressed and the whole case

216
00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:02,720
thrown out of court because we live in a

217
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:05,159
rural area in Iowa it's on private

218
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,519
property and so when the police had been

219
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:08,799
going through our trash to try to find

220
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,519
something they said they found a stem

221
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:12,719
and that was the justification for the

222
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:17,320
warrant they had been trespassing on a

223
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:19,440
private drive so we had upcoming motions

224
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:21,278
uh hearings for the Motions on uh

225
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,640
suppression to try to see if the the

226
00:10:21,278 --> 00:10:26,799
warrant was even valid um all of these

227
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:28,958
different different things so it it's

228
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:31,559
taken well it's taken an entire year

229
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:34,078
since the uh original uh

230
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:37,159
raid um but we wanted a jury of our

231
00:10:34,078 --> 00:10:40,039
peers and our you know fortunately we

232
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:41,759
had attorneys who were you know with it

233
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:44,399
all the way they were filing motions

234
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:45,480
they were doing everything they could

235
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:49,039
and

236
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:51,959
um problem is his good attorney lost her

237
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:54,000
license because well it doesn't seem to

238
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:55,838
make any sense she had been doing a lot

239
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,799
of work for him and I think that there

240
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:00,279
was somebody higher up trying to kind of

241
00:10:57,799 --> 00:11:02,399
cut her out of the way and as you know

242
00:11:00,278 --> 00:11:05,000
as I'll as I'll describe to you what

243
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:08,879
happened during the trial sort of the

244
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:11,120
control yet mind control or just wanting

245
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:13,679
to have another conviction no matter

246
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,919
what uh it seemed like uh it was not a

247
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:18,879
fair trial the judge would not allow a

248
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:22,439
medical defense um he wouldn't even

249
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:25,078
allow Ben to tell the jury that he had

250
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:28,600
cancer he wasn't even allowed to discuss

251
00:11:25,078 --> 00:11:30,199
his condition um at all the jury had no

252
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:32,320
idea

253
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:34,759
what you folks were facing or the very

254
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:37,399
reason you were doing

255
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:42,278
this and then they also prosecuted your

256
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:44,559
son yes yeah and well his friend

257
00:11:42,278 --> 00:11:45,838
originally but they they offered a plea

258
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:48,799
agreement to his friend and I guess he

259
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:51,480
took it because he was very he was very

260
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:54,479
scared uh he wasn't going to be throwing

261
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:57,240
us under the bus mind you he just he had

262
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:59,720
been looking for an opportunity to

263
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:03,159
become a States witness so that it would

264
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:05,560
give him an opportunity to when you know

265
00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:07,319
taking the witness stand to to just you

266
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:09,319
know risk all risk getting thrown and

267
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:11,600
contempt to court to say look this is

268
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:14,839
what my friend was going through I was

269
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:18,000
helping him he has cancer he was making

270
00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:20,320
cannabis oil well it seemed like the

271
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,839
state was pretty much onto the strategy

272
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:26,120
of our defense and they didn't allow

273
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:28,800
that it controlled uh every

274
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:30,879
aspect every aspect of the the jury

275
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:33,359
trial and it took a good 3 Days To even

276
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:37,078
select a jury because so many people had

277
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:40,079
already read um newspaper articles that

278
00:12:37,078 --> 00:12:42,000
um the Quad City Times uh writer uh

279
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:45,838
Brian wellner had been following up on

280
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:49,519
our story since September MH of uh last

281
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:53,639
year and just there was just so much

282
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:55,278
control and uh you know constantly uh

283
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:57,079
keeping the jury in the dark they would

284
00:12:55,278 --> 00:12:59,879
take them in the other room to address

285
00:12:57,078 --> 00:13:01,759
issues going on with Ben's health um he

286
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:04,078
needed to take a lot of breaks and then

287
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:06,838
on the 7th of July uh right in the

288
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:09,319
middle of the trial he pretty much

289
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:12,360
collapsed he had um we had to rush him

290
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:14,519
to the hospital called an ambulance and

291
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:17,639
his uh potassium levels and his

292
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:20,679
hemoglobin had just dropped uh he'd been

293
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:22,120
sweating um profusely um just having

294
00:13:20,679 --> 00:13:23,399
cold sweats for the last couple of

295
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:26,560
months because at this point he's at

296
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:28,480
stage four of his cancer um everything

297
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:30,799
metastasized when he was in jail so it

298
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,920
just kind of went from stage one to

299
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:35,879
stage three to stage four in a matter of

300
00:13:32,919 --> 00:13:38,759
months so

301
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:41,720
he he's at this he's at the point now

302
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:45,120
where cold sweats and you know nausea

303
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:47,720
and things like that start to set in so

304
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:50,679
I mean this this happened

305
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:52,920
um you know without the jury having any

306
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:54,919
idea they were just shoved off to their

307
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:57,399
little deliberation room probably under

308
00:13:54,919 --> 00:13:58,639
lock and key and not allowed to even

309
00:13:57,399 --> 00:14:01,198
look out the window and see the fire

310
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:03,320
trucks that you know came pulling up in

311
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:04,439
front of the uh the ambulance pulling up

312
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:08,240
in front of the

313
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:09,680
courthouse and the judge was not uh very

314
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,039
understanding like he promised he would

315
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:15,359
be about Ben's condition

316
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:17,399
he uh he basically uh thought that Ben

317
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,600
was mingering that maybe he was faking

318
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:22,360
something to try to get out of this

319
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,639
trial which is not the case at all we we

320
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,879
got him to the hospital and they had to

321
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:27,399
give him a

322
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:29,679
transfusion and uh the doctor's orders

323
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:31,240
were no he's not going anywhere tonight

324
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:32,879
he's staying here we're going to watch

325
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:35,959
over him and the next morning they were

326
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:37,519
trying to address you know keeping him

327
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:39,518
uh keeping his pain medication

328
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:41,120
stabilized and all of those things but

329
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,600
the judge was insistent well he needs to

330
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,078
be back the next morning we need to get

331
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:48,199
on with this trial so it was just it was

332
00:14:45,078 --> 00:14:51,479
inhumane it's incredibly inhumane yeah

333
00:14:48,198 --> 00:14:55,000
I'm sorry I'm ashamed for our government

334
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:57,120
that's done this to you and uh you know

335
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,639
I wish I could offer you Sanctuary here

336
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,600
in Oregon I mean maybe we can put you in

337
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:03,959
a local church or something you know and

338
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,519
uh say you know no more you know they're

339
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:08,319
in the safe Zone you know they that's an

340
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:10,679
ancient concept that we should have

341
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,720
something like that I think especially

342
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:15,120
for someone going through that it's just

343
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:18,240
heartbreaking we appreciate it

344
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:21,560
too there's just no way we could bow out

345
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:23,879
of this fight now right now what do you

346
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:26,239
think they they mentioned an appeal Bond

347
00:15:23,879 --> 00:15:29,278
right now you're here in Oregon on a

348
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:32,560
bond uh do you think it's likely you had

349
00:15:29,278 --> 00:15:35,879
any communication that says you might be

350
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:39,278
allowed to continue to be on appeal Bond

351
00:15:35,879 --> 00:15:41,879
well I'm actually not on a bond my my

352
00:15:39,278 --> 00:15:45,318
wife is out on bond but I they let me

353
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:49,759
out of jail to avoid any medical

354
00:15:45,318 --> 00:15:53,000
expenses I see I see so uh technically

355
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:57,079
until uh sentencing if they sentence me

356
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:59,399
to any jail time or any anything at all

357
00:15:57,078 --> 00:16:02,919
they're going to try to put me in prison

358
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:07,679
I don't know if they'll wait until I

359
00:16:02,919 --> 00:16:09,919
apply uh or appeal it before they try to

360
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:13,359
put me in jail otherwise if they put me

361
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:16,559
in jail then I can bond out from their

362
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:19,199
probably Casper I was just all the

363
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:21,638
support that seems to be rallying around

364
00:16:19,198 --> 00:16:24,159
the case and all that you've gone

365
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:26,799
through I know in California they have

366
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:28,958
groups that show up at cour houses with

367
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:30,559
uh signs and make a lot of noise out

368
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:34,359
outside so you any

369
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:37,239
Community has there been there was noise

370
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:39,639
of it happening but we haven't seen a

371
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:42,399
lot so you're in a little area though

372
00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:46,198
there's not any big urban area except De

373
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:48,759
Moine in in Iowa right so for its area

374
00:16:46,198 --> 00:16:52,838
uh the Quad City's area is is pretty big

375
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:55,680
it's uh it's about Iowa City size maybe

376
00:16:52,839 --> 00:16:58,600
bigger but the the community support's

377
00:16:55,679 --> 00:17:00,159
been really really and why did you have

378
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,680
such a the problem with your attorneys

379
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:04,519
taking your case in the direction you

380
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:07,759
wanted I mean it's your

381
00:17:04,519 --> 00:17:11,798
case um I was settled with him in the

382
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:14,439
last with a month to go before uh jury

383
00:17:11,798 --> 00:17:17,480
selection and then I wasn't even

384
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:19,640
contacted by him for another two weeks

385
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:24,240
so we had two weeks to go to build a

386
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:26,439
case and first thing uh he wanted was to

387
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:30,120
try to deal with this on

388
00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:35,960
a on a

389
00:17:30,119 --> 00:17:38,639
a plea and I just demanded he'd never

390
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:41,400
ever enter into that train of thought

391
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:43,919
again and that's when we started

392
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:46,160
clashing but he he had plans on trying

393
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:49,280
to change things instead of being

394
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:52,080
straight with me and backing out when I

395
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:54,319
still had time to give somebody else

396
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:57,519
exactly the same chance he had to at

397
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:59,119
least support me or Letta how do you

398
00:17:57,519 --> 00:18:00,720
think things are going to go for

399
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:05,959
yourself and your son and your your

400
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:08,839
husband here do you have any insight or

401
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:11,038
just hopes and prayers hopes and prayers

402
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:15,720
mostly uh yeah

403
00:18:11,038 --> 00:18:19,079
it's it's been suggested that we'll have

404
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:21,519
um I well I I did talk to his former

405
00:18:19,079 --> 00:18:25,158
attorney and she said something about

406
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:27,400
appeals Bond so I'm really not

407
00:18:25,159 --> 00:18:29,080
completely you know educated about that

408
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:31,080
whole process we have talked other

409
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:34,879
people who have been through this

410
00:18:31,079 --> 00:18:37,359
process before who think that we are uh

411
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,480
in a position to wait I really don't at

412
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:42,839
this point I don't think after all the

413
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:46,400
attention that this judge Henry

414
00:18:42,839 --> 00:18:48,439
leam uh has has had which has not been

415
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:51,320
the right kind of attention he's he

416
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:53,480
certainly is not a hero now everyone in

417
00:18:51,319 --> 00:18:55,480
Iowa and basically Nationwide since the

418
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:57,880
story went out on the Associated Press

419
00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:01,558
It's Been Everywhere uh he they've had

420
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:05,240
to shut down the phone lines to uh his

421
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:07,558
yeah his lines and uh the prosecutor's

422
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:10,120
uh phone lines and uh there's just been

423
00:19:07,558 --> 00:19:11,678
