63
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:10,919
thing for oh yeah great thing for the

64
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:14,120
country not just Washington but for the

65
00:06:10,918 --> 00:06:16,598
whole nation really you know it it's

66
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:19,079
bigger than Washington this is the

67
00:06:16,598 --> 00:06:21,879
really a huge step Colorado took the

68
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:24,879
first one we took Washington took the

69
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:27,199
second I'm just glad I was part of it

70
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:30,279
the price will come down as soon as uh

71
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:32,840
Supply meets up with demand um prices

72
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:34,918
will come down and it'll be marginally

73
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:36,719
higher than what it was on the streets

74
00:06:34,918 --> 00:06:39,120
just to compensate for taxes and I'm

75
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,919
willing to pay that um to be able to do

76
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,959
it legally and not be persecuted for it

77
00:06:41,918 --> 00:06:46,560
and you know if the state can generate

78
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:48,598
income and fill up some Gap budget GS

79
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,240
hey I'll smoke a bowl for schools any

80
00:06:48,598 --> 00:06:53,079
day you know you know for me it means

81
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:55,079
that we can actually start funding our

82
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:56,519
schools putting more money into our

83
00:06:55,079 --> 00:07:00,120
police departments and hopefully find

84
00:06:56,519 --> 00:07:00,120
the cure for cancer
