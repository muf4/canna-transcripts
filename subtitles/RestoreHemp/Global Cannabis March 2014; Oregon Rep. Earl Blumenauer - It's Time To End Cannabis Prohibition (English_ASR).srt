1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:07,919
oregon has led in innovation nationally

2
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:10,800
we protected our beaches

3
00:00:07,918 --> 00:00:12,558
the bottle bill land use

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,599
40 years ago

5
00:00:12,558 --> 00:00:19,679
oregon was the first state to

6
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,679
decriminalize marijuana

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,359
and i was an impressionable young

8
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:26,960
legislator actually voted on that

9
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,880
legislation

10
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:32,000
and there was another

11
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:36,079
debate that occurred during that session

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,519
it was led by a conservative republican

13
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,600
pig farmer

14
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,160
from hermiston oregon

15
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,520
a remarkable gentleman named stafford

16
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:46,159
hansel

17
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,559
who had a distinguished career as a

18
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:51,038
long-term state legislator

19
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:54,399
he was active in administration he

20
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:56,960
helped protect the land use system

21
00:00:54,399 --> 00:01:00,160
but stafford gave what i think was one

22
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:02,640
of the most compelling speeches

23
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:05,039
i've ever heard in my life

24
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,320
here was a

25
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,320
conservative

26
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:10,839
republican

27
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:15,039
didn't smoke drink

28
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:18,320
swear who got up and led the state

29
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:21,360
legislature through a tutorial

30
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:25,279
he pointed out a package of cigarettes

31
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:27,840
that killed 400 000 people a year

32
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,759
that was legal

33
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,359
he had a bottle of jack daniels i think

34
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,920
it may have been the only time he'd ever

35
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:36,719
held the bottle of liquor

36
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,960
and he pointed out that for some people

37
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:41,200
alcohol was toxic

38
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:43,919
and it contributed to the deaths of tens

39
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,079
of thousands of people on a highway

40
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,719
each year

41
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:52,078
and then he had a baggie

42
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:53,759
with a marijuana cigarette

43
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:55,919
and he pointed out that

44
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,560
people didn't die from it

45
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,759
that it wasn't as addictive it wasn't as

46
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,920
destructive

47
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:04,478
and that it was illegal

48
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:07,680
and he proceeded to defend

49
00:02:04,478 --> 00:02:09,758
a bill we had on the floor of the house

50
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,200
that would have

51
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:15,679
authorized

52
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:17,039
two plants for personal consumption

53
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,280
i'm told

54
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:21,359
by knowledgeable people

55
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,080
at the capitol at that time

56
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,160
if the 19 of us

57
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,480
who voted for it

58
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:30,959
had been joined by the people who voted

59
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:32,719
no but smoked dope

60
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:35,519
then it probably would have passed and

61
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:39,680
oregon would have been the first state

62
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,680
to legalize adult use

63
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:44,479
at the same time oregon was having this

64
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:46,959
discussion about a more rational

65
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:50,159
approach to marijuana

66
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:53,039
we were watching at the federal level a

67
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:55,439
war on drugs being launched in the nixon

68
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:58,560
administration

69
00:02:55,439 --> 00:03:00,400
and it had a much different approach

70
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,878
to marijuana

71
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,480
the legacy of that

72
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:06,479
war on drugs

73
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:11,518
was classifying

74
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:11,518
marijuana as a schedule one drug

75
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:22,719
the consequences of that our legion

76
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:25,599
first and foremost as you know

77
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:29,120
classifying marijuana as being as

78
00:03:25,598 --> 00:03:30,399
dangerous as heroin or lsd is simply

79
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,560
false

80
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,158
it's false

81
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,799
telling people

82
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:38,959
that it is more dangerous

83
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:42,879
than cocaine

84
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:45,199
or methamphetamines schedule two

85
00:03:42,878 --> 00:03:48,399
the meth

86
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:50,878
epidemic that is destroying rural and

87
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:54,158
small town communities

88
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:56,959
suggests we've got our priorities

89
00:03:54,158 --> 00:03:56,959
upside down

90
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:05,039
it also suggests to me part of a need to

91
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:09,680
reappraise what is can only be described

92
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:15,840
as a failed war on drugs

93
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:15,840
we're spending 25 billion dollars a year

94
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,560
we are arresting

95
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,360
three quarters of a million people a

96
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:26,560
year for something that most americans

97
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:29,040
now think should be legal

98
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,360
and there are as you're well aware some

99
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:34,639
of the most egregious

100
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,000
racial disparities

101
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:39,519
targeting

102
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,600
young african-american men

103
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:43,439
greater than any other sector of the

104
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,080
population

105
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:47,918
even though their use is no greater

106
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:51,198
maybe even a little less

107
00:04:47,918 --> 00:04:51,198
than white young men

108
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:54,839
and there are people

109
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:56,399
doing time

110
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:59,758
now

111
00:04:56,399 --> 00:05:01,679
as a result of the consequences of this

112
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:04,560
act

113
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:07,199
we've been involved in congress

114
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,600
in the effort to help

115
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,759
rationalize

116
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,600
our drug treatment

117
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,120
drug approaches

118
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,600
part of it

119
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:21,199
is to make sure that the federal

120
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:24,199
government is not interfering in medical

121
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,199
marijuana

122
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:29,680
part of

123
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,520
the lie

124
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,560
in federal statute

125
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:35,439
as a

126
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:37,839
category with schedule one narcotic it

127
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:41,120
has no

128
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:41,119
therapeutic value

129
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,160
not

130
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,079
true

131
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:51,199
and luckily

132
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:54,079
voters starting in california in 1996

133
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:57,038
as the first state followed by oregon in

134
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:59,359
the next election we now have 21 states

135
00:05:57,038 --> 00:06:03,519
and the district of columbia

136
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,639
representing over 106 million americans

137
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:06,478
who have

138
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:11,199
access that's legal

139
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:11,199
under state law to medical marijuana

140
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,879
a million americans now are legally

141
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:22,160
authorized to have access

142
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:24,959
and i have heard countless stories about

143
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:27,439
the difference that it has made in their

144
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:27,439
lives

145
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,960
part of what we're doing in congress and

146
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:37,919
i will tell you i'm encouraged

147
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:39,359
because we now have 13 pieces of

148
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:42,318
legislation

149
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,919
most of it bipartisan

150
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,520
to try and bring

151
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:48,399
some sense

152
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:50,399
into this upside down world

153
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:52,399
that is marijuana regulation in the

154
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:54,719
united states

155
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:58,638
we have legislation and bipartisan

156
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:00,880
support to stop the lunacy

157
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:03,840
of making

158
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:08,159
marijuana legal marijuana businesses

159
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:11,279
be all cash enterprises

160
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:13,840
what's the logic here

161
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:16,399
if you care about money laundering if

162
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:19,119
you care about tax evasion

163
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:20,399
or just burglary

164
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,120
forcing

165
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:26,239
perfectly legal enterprises to

166
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:30,160
pay their taxes with a shopping bag full

167
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:35,038
of twenty dollar bills

168
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:35,039
doesn't make any sense at all

169
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:39,598
or

170
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:42,478
because of a quirk in the tax law

171
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:43,439
forcing them to pay two and three times

172
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:47,120
higher

173
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:48,800
tax rates again for perfectly legal

174
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,800
businesses

175
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,240
is wrong

176
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,960
but i will tell you some of you are

177
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:57,680
familiar with a rep a conservative

178
00:07:54,959 --> 00:08:00,719
republican tax advocate

179
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,720
grover norquist

180
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:07,520
grover was with me

181
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:09,038
at a press conference for my bill

182
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:12,318
to allow

183
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:15,038
legal marijuana businesses to deduct

184
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,560
their business expenses that's how far

185
00:08:15,038 --> 00:08:18,878
we're coming

186
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,399
that's how far we're coming

187
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,080
wednesday

188
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:23,279
on the floor of the house i had an

189
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:26,878
amendment

190
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:29,119
that would have allowed our veterans

191
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,240
to be able to talk

192
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,799
to

193
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:36,120
their va doctors

194
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:36,120
about marijuana

195
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:46,639
why should our veterans be treated as

196
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:48,000
second-class citizens

197
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:50,639
in those

198
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,919
states where medical marijuana is legal

199
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:56,240
why should they not be able to talk to

200
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:58,079
their primary doctor

201
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,399
about whether it's right for them or

202
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,399
wrong

203
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,720
we weren't successful

204
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,639
but we got

205
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:11,839
195 votes

206
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:13,039
including two dozen republicans

207
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,680
who said

208
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:18,319
this doesn't make any sense

209
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:20,879
and i was told by one of my republican

210
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:23,440
co-sponsors of the legislation that he

211
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:25,039
was convinced that there were 12 or 13

212
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,440
republicans who if they better

213
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:29,838
understood it would have voted

214
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,839
with us

215
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:34,879
we're on the move

216
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,440
in the united states congress

217
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:38,958
we passed an amendment

218
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,080
that allows

219
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:46,079
research agriculture institutions

220
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:48,560
to research industrial hemp

221
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:51,839
which passed

222
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:55,679
with a significant yes vote

223
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:56,800
we now have a dozen states

224
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:59,199
that are

225
00:09:56,799 --> 00:10:01,919
poised to allow

226
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,200
industrial hemp production

227
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:05,599
and we have signals from the

228
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,399
administration that these are part of

229
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,839
the

230
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,159
the smaller fish that the

231
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:13,920
administration's not going to fry that

232
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:16,480
we'll be able to proceed with this

233
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:19,120
and it's about time

234
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,278
some of you have been involved

235
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:24,320
with trying to promote

236
00:10:21,278 --> 00:10:26,078
not just the use of legal hemp products

237
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,800
which of course they are and they're

238
00:10:26,078 --> 00:10:30,799
sustainable and they're beneficial

239
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:34,000
it's just that oregon farmers and

240
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:37,120
ranchers can't grow it

241
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,278
kentucky tobacco farmers can't grow it

242
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:42,000
it's got to be imported

243
00:10:39,278 --> 00:10:47,480
from outside the united states

244
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,480
but we're turning the corner on that

245
00:10:48,078 --> 00:10:53,759
we have to do a better job i think of

246
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:56,560
breaking the stranglehold of this

247
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:58,319
pernicious classification

248
00:10:56,559 --> 00:11:00,958
that prevents

249
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,000
research

250
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:03,599
into

251
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
marijuana

252
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,720
up on the hill

253
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,278
i met with neurologists

254
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:13,759
people who are dealing with problems of

255
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:17,278
our children

256
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:20,159
they talked about those with violent

257
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:21,120
epilepsy these parents are willing to

258
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:23,519
move

259
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,200
their families to be able to have access

260
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,440
to medical marijuana that will prevent

261
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,920
these violent seizures

262
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:32,640
but the scientists

263
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:34,559
cannot get marijuana to study what works

264
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:36,879
and why

265
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:38,639
that's an outrage

266
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:43,000
oregon was a leader

267
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:43,000
40 years ago in decriminalization

268
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:49,679
oregon has a chance

269
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:54,039
to be the explosion that breaks the dam

270
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:54,039
on marijuana policy nationally

271
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:01,200
it's great what we have in washington

272
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:03,039
and colorado

273
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,399
it's great that we've got 21 states in

274
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:07,360
the district columbia with medical

275
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:10,879
marijuana but we're on the

276
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:14,959
just on the cusp right now of changing

277
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:14,958
national policy once and for all

278
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:22,159
it'll be great in alaska if this summer

279
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:24,959
they legalize adult use

280
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:25,838
but alaska's sort of up there and out

281
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:27,838
there

282
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:31,920
i don't think the land of the mid

283
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:36,399
midnight sun and sarah palin is going

284
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:36,399
is going to start a national trend

285
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:43,759
it's great that medical marijuana is on

286
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:43,759
the ballot in florida this year

287
00:12:44,278 --> 00:12:48,799
700 000 signatures

288
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:54,480
but given the florida constitution will

289
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:55,599
require a 60 percent less yes vote to

290
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:59,039
pass and

291
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:00,959
that's questionable here in oregon

292
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:03,919
we have an opportunity

293
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:05,759
to cast a ballot for a rational

294
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:09,679
marijuana policy

295
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:12,319
that will be followed across the country

296
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:14,958
it'll open the floodgates in california

297
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:17,440
in 2016

298
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:20,239
and we can get down to business

299
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:22,560
we can tax it regulate it keep it out of

300
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:25,759
the hands of the kids

301
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:28,479
and stop interfering with people's lives

302
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:30,480
i'd ask you to study it

303
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,959
get involved

304
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:35,680
sign a petition

305
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:38,078
and spread the word

306
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:41,120
so that we can have success

307
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:43,838
this november oregon can do it thank you

308
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,839
very much
