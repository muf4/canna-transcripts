00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:06,399
I love the global Cannabis March because

2
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:08,718
it's my activism or my cannabis activism

3
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:12,160
anniversary the first Global Cannabis

4
00:00:08,718 --> 00:00:15,039
March I came to was in 2001 I came as a

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:18,600
volunteer for what was PDX normal at

6
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:20,518
that time and I registered voters and I

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,320
created a mailing list of people who

8
00:00:20,518 --> 00:00:25,439
were interested in getting information

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,839
about cannabis legalization little did I

10
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,359
know that by suggesting that maybe we

11
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:31,920
send these people a letter I would

12
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:34,200
become the Secretary of what was Oregon

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:37,239
normal and a founder of Oregon normal

14
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:41,039
and be here 14 years later still working

15
00:00:37,238 --> 00:00:43,280
for cannabis freedom I am honored to be

16
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:45,079
here and I think that one of the things

17
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,760
that it's really important that we talk

18
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:50,640
about today is to remember to be

19
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:53,439
grateful for those who have come before

20
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:56,439
us and to remember that gratitude is the

21
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:58,759
attitude to have moving forward there

22
00:00:56,439 --> 00:01:00,759
are a lot of things not to like about

23
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:03,518
what the government is is trying to do

24
00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:06,478
around implementing measure 91 and I

25
00:01:03,518 --> 00:01:09,079
Echo mine's sentiments that we need to

26
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:11,200
St press our legislature hard this year

27
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:13,400
to implement measure 91 as it was

28
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:16,680
written that means they leave the

29
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:19,240
medical marijuana program

30
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,920
alone but here's the thing A lot of

31
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:22,959
people are getting really mad about that

32
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:25,960
and they're all up in arms and I would

33
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:27,679
say to you this measure 91 they say

34
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:29,599
doesn't go far enough it's like how many

35
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,799
plans can you legally have now any of

36
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:36,199
you that aren't patients none so four

37
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:37,960
looks pretty good to me right I mean I

38
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:40,719
think I could probably grow four decent

39
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:42,719
plants and they would turn out I mean I

40
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:45,438
don't know I'm not that good at it but I

41
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:48,239
can grow some weed too so if everybody

42
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:49,839
can grow just a little then isn't that a

43
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:51,640
good thing instead of going to jail

44
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:55,680
instead of losing your family instead of

45
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:57,439
losing your job I would say yes so how

46
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,880
did that come about well it came about

47
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:02,038
from years and years of people add

48
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:04,078
advocating for cannabis Freedom before

49
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:06,640
many of you ever even knew it was

50
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:08,199
happening and I would say we need to

51
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,000
thank those people we need to thank

52
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:12,799
those organizations that stepped up

53
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,439
first that came out first and showed us

54
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,040
the way and led the P the way to where

55
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:20,479
we're at now which

56
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:22,039
is inches from legalization we're two

57
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:23,280
months away from being able to smoke a

58
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:25,679
joint at home without having to worry

59
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:29,199
about getting busted how cool is that

60
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:32,000
it's the coolest so remember to have

61
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:34,479
gratitude for organizations like normal

62
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,159
like students for sensible drug policy

63
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:40,199
like um

64
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:43,560
crrh the THCF CL clinic and people like

65
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:46,280
meline Martinez Paul Stanford Scott

66
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:49,000
Gordon Aiko and all of those who have

67
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:51,400
come before us who made it possible for

68
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,360
us to be where we are I think that if we

69
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,920
remember our history moving forward we

70
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,480
could move forward more quickly because

71
00:02:55,919 --> 00:03:00,318
we can learn from the mistakes that were

72
00:02:57,479 --> 00:03:02,759
made in the past my name is Anna is and

73
00:03:00,318 --> 00:03:05,798
I am proud to be a stoner join me and

74
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:09,759
let's end cannabis prohibition once and

75
00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:09,760
for all thank you
