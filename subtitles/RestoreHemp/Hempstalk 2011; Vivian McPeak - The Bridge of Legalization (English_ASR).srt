1
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:08,080
hempstock thank you so much for being at

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:09,839
this wonderful sacred event it's always

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,718
a demonstration of two things it's a

4
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:14,199
demonstration against the

5
00:00:11,718 --> 00:00:15,759
laws and it's a demonstration that we

6
00:00:14,199 --> 00:00:18,439
can come together peacefully over and

7
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,960
over and over with no problem because

8
00:00:18,439 --> 00:00:22,759
the only problem with the whole cannabis

9
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:24,480
thing is the laws cannabis prohibition

10
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:26,199
as we know is fixing a problem that

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,518
doesn't

12
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:30,840
exist and uh we had Hemp Fest this year

13
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:33,399
was our th

14
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:36,280
anniversary it was a hard

15
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:37,719
year initially we uh had a five-month

16
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,920
battle with the city over the permit

17
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:42,399
they didn't want to give us a permit to

18
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:44,039
have the event because they building a a

19
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:47,160
bridge a sky bridge over the road and

20
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:51,079
into the to the park and it's a real big

21
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:52,799
event with 150 100 250 I think thousand

22
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:55,280
people we had this year 280,000

23
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:56,679
something like that it's a big footprint

24
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,160
event and there's not a lot of places in

25
00:00:56,679 --> 00:01:00,719
Seattle to have Seattle Hempfest and so

26
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:03,599
we had a five Monon long permit battle

27
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:06,359
and we sued the city of Seattle and we

28
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,040
won and we won a third day you know the

29
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:10,478
city said you're too big for that Park

30
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,680
and we said give us a third day and they

31
00:01:10,478 --> 00:01:14,359
says well why and we said because if you

32
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:16,960
give us a third day that Friday is going

33
00:01:14,359 --> 00:01:17,879
to pull enough off a Saturday that that

34
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:19,279
there's going to be enough room for

35
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:21,158
everybody it's going to work real smooth

36
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,118
and they said well where's your science

37
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:26,240
behind that and that's just a theory and

38
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:27,719
and that's not proven and when uh we won

39
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:29,280
this year we won the third day as well

40
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:31,039
and Friday was our most attended day and

41
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,640
Saturday was totally smooth and we were

42
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,280
right and hopefully that's going to have

43
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:37,560
an impact on next year but every year is

44
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,599
a struggle every year got to fight for

45
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:42,960
it Freedom doesn't come easy comes with

46
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:44,798
a lot of responsibility and you know at

47
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:47,399
Hempfest one of the reasons we've gotten

48
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:49,320
20 years down the road with such a big

49
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:51,960
event is that we try to take a safety

50
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:54,078
first approach we we're not always

51
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:55,879
perfect you know we make mistakes we aim

52
00:01:54,078 --> 00:01:57,319
to please our aim is not always perfect

53
00:01:55,879 --> 00:01:59,078
but we try to learn from that we try to

54
00:01:57,319 --> 00:02:00,839
always do a better job and and that's

55
00:01:59,078 --> 00:02:02,359
gotten us down the road Road and here

56
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,478
Portland hemstock you know I've watched

57
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:07,879
this event grow and flower and Blossom

58
00:02:05,478 --> 00:02:10,159
you know and wow this this year is just

59
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:12,560
so beautiful it's just such a beautiful

60
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:14,318
location with such an iy Ambiance and

61
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,479
like Hempfest it's right by the water

62
00:02:14,318 --> 00:02:19,799
energy which is always good and uh the

63
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:21,639
weather couldn't be better it's really

64
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:24,319
beautiful it's kind of perfect weather

65
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:27,238
to grow a big stand of pot plants

66
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:30,679
in and uh and it's always a

67
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:32,159
blessing I think often of Jack her

68
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:34,080
friend of mine that I knew for a long

69
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:35,400
time Jack only missed one Seattle H Fest

70
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,640
and that's the first year that he had

71
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,879
his his first stroke but but you know

72
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:41,119
most people would their career would

73
00:02:39,878 --> 00:02:43,000
have been over right then it would have

74
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:46,439
been done and he would have had an

75
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,080
incredibly illustrious career and uh and

76
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:49,519
and and all these books and his

77
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,959
incredible work if he'd stopped right

78
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,879
there but not Jack Harris not the kind

79
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,959
of guy was he came right back the next

80
00:02:53,878 --> 00:02:57,598
year and and he came to him Fest and he

81
00:02:55,959 --> 00:02:59,959
you could hardly understand a word that

82
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:01,280
he said after his first stroke but he

83
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:03,000
got up there on the stage in front of

84
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,439
everybody he was so Driven Man he wasn't

85
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,120
going to let that stop him and he was up

86
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:08,840
there and sometimes it take him 15

87
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,239
minutes to get his five- minute speech

88
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:13,039
in and then Jack was back the next year

89
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:14,158
and he was speaking a little bit better

90
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:15,280
and he's back the next year and he's

91
00:03:14,158 --> 00:03:17,400
speaking a little bit better and pretty

92
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,439
soon man he was Jack was speaking pretty

93
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:24,439
good and he was taking hemp oil every

94
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:26,959
day and he was taking uh Rick simpsons's

95
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:30,318
pot oil every day I know cuz I saw him

96
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:32,319
take it and uh and everybody's got to

97
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:33,639
die but Jack Herr really bounced back

98
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:35,158
man and he was one of the most driven

99
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:37,079
people I've ever seen Jack really if you

100
00:03:35,158 --> 00:03:41,000
think about it he sacrificed his life

101
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:43,439
for the can of's movement he did because

102
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,878
he literally went until he dropped man

103
00:03:43,438 --> 00:03:47,079
and when he dropped the first time he

104
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:49,000
got up and he kept going again and the

105
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:52,640
second time he dropped he never got back

106
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,759
up but that guy is the true hemp Warrior

107
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:56,719
of all time and he was a great friend

108
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:57,679
and it's it's always going to you know

109
00:03:56,719 --> 00:04:00,000
it's always going to be something we

110
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,000
think about when we're at hemstock uh of

111
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,639
how much we love Jack and all the people

112
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
at Seattle hempest this year on our main

113
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:06,078
stage and a couple of our other stages

114
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,759
we had something really cool we had

115
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:10,920
these these thin transparent prayer

116
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:12,598
flags on this really thin meshed cloth

117
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:14,078
that had pictures of all of our fallen

118
00:04:12,598 --> 00:04:15,679
folks of of all the people in the

119
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:16,959
Hempfest family over 20 years who've

120
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,918
passed away while they were working on

121
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:21,798
the cause while they were a member of

122
00:04:18,918 --> 00:04:23,198
Hempfest of the family um and we try to

123
00:04:21,798 --> 00:04:24,758
really honor all those people and the

124
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,600
thing that always strikes us as man I

125
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:29,240
wish they could see how far we've gotten

126
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:31,800
right now they'd be so proud of all of

127
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:34,000
it of everybody's work um so I want to

128
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,960
thank all the volunteers with hemstock

129
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,680
and everybody you know there's a lot in

130
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:40,198
the Cannabis Reform movement in the LI

131
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,680
legalization movement for the last 25

132
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:44,400
years that I've been actively involved

133
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:47,360
in it um there's been this kind of Kum

134
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:48,959
by a camaraderie this kinship everybody

135
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,199
got along and everything was Rosy and

136
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:52,799
and wonderful because the nuts and bolts

137
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,120
dynamics of legalization were so far

138
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,079
down the road it was IR irrelevant at

139
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,759
the time you know it's like it's like

140
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:59,319
would you argue about crossing a bridge

141
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:02,560
while you still have 20 miles of woods

142
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:03,519
to get get through probably not but when

143
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,759
you get to that bridge you're going to

144
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:06,198
be arguing about how the best way to get

145
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:08,120
across that thing is we're at the bridge

146
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:09,478
of legalization now and man are we

147
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:11,199
arguing about it and people have

148
00:05:09,478 --> 00:05:12,839
different initiatives out and different

149
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,360
ideas on how it should happen there's a

150
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:16,239
lot of infighting with the movement

151
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:18,120
within the movement and it's just

152
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,478
important for the community to remember

153
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:22,399
that we're a part of this incredibly

154
00:05:19,478 --> 00:05:24,879
beautiful artistic peaceful wonderful

155
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:26,799
gentle community and all the activists

156
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:28,439
have to realize that that we represent

157
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,720
this huge Community that's bigger than

158
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:32,719
us and to try to keep as much unity in

159
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,880
our community as we possibly can while

160
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,919
we increase the peace uh thank you so

161
