1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,439
well i think it's very interesting that

2
00:00:03,198 --> 00:00:08,320
we know from

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:10,480
historical records that that canada's

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,960
cannabis has been used for literally

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,839
thousands of years

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,640
and

7
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:19,519
nobody has ever reported any

8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:22,000
bad effects from the use of it yeah

9
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:24,800
and when you compare that to tobacco or

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,800
to alcohol

11
00:00:25,118 --> 00:00:29,439
there's absolutely no comparison between

12
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:31,919
between

13
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:33,119
tobacco alcohol and marijuana they're

14
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,800
just absolutely

15
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:36,238
none whatsoever

16
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:38,558
and and

17
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:40,799
the statement that

18
00:00:38,558 --> 00:00:44,159
that marijuana is a gateway drug to

19
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:46,000
heroin or cocaine or whatever

20
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:48,159
this was

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
verbally thriced by the institute of

22
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:54,398
medicine that said there was no evidence

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,480
whatsoever that this was the case so

24
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,558
i think i think

25
00:00:56,479 --> 00:01:00,640
the main thing that we're doing is uh

26
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:02,878
supporting general mccafferty and a

27
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,478
whole bunch of dea agents who are making

28
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:06,879
very high salaries

29
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:09,920
and don't want to give up the

30
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:12,478
the the game as you might you might say

31
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,799
so the people that are making money uh

32
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:15,840
on the marijuana issue are the dea

33
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,880
agents

34
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:21,200
so i guess the federal prisons uh the

35
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:22,798
guards and the prisons are probably also

36
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,560
recipients of a lot of money from the

37
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,640
marijuana business so exactly it's

38
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,840
really a straight strange

39
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:32,719
absolutely bizarre situation that that

40
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,719
this has gone on and i can't understand

41
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:36,640
why some of these uh

42
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:38,158
politicians in washington dc and

43
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,560
elsewhere

44
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,560
can't see this or understand it or

45
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,799
whatever the right word is i don't

46
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:48,719
i don't understand it

47
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:50,799
i was a battalion scout and point man

48
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:52,719
and any of you guys or veterans you know

49
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:55,280
what the hell appointment means the life

50
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:57,840
expectancy is about 30 minutes or so

51
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,799
something like that

52
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,920
and

53
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:04,640
i was in a war history writing class

54
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,240
with about 10 vietnam guys and i told

55
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,479
them that i was a point man and scout

56
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:10,639
they says oh no you weren't and he says

57
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:13,440
god damn it yes i was and he's nah you

58
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:14,559
were if you were you'd be dead

59
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:16,159
so

60
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,439
here i am

61
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:20,000
mean as hell

62
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:20,000
and so forth

63
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,560
how many of you read the story in the

64
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,560
oregonian last week about the dea trying

65
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,560
to get a hold of your patients charts

66
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,920
how many raise your hands

67
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,719
you read that

68
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:37,119
well let me tell you the dea skunks and

69
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:39,280
the local cops are all going crazy

70
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,719
because you bastards have

71
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,719
permits to use marijuana

72
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:51,840
when the board took away my license in

73
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,840
november three years ago

74
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:58,158
i was really disgusted with this because

75
00:02:55,199 --> 00:03:00,158
they thought that they were punishing me

76
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:03,359
they were not punishing me they were

77
00:03:00,158 --> 00:03:06,399
they were punishing my 4 000 patients

78
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:09,040
and and i i get the idea that they were

79
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,840
trying to stop the medical marijuana

80
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:14,239
program marijuana is the best drug we

81
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,519
have found so far for the treatment of

82
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,519
ptsd

83
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,200
and within the last month i just wrote

84
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:23,039
an article

85
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:24,479
that that marijuana prevents ptsd

86
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:27,120
suicides

87
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:28,798
and i got about a thousand comments on

88
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,239
it from all over the country well you

89
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:33,439
know i was in the military but i didn't

90
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:36,560
see combat but i i uh

91
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:39,280
do know as a marijuana user that when i

92
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,840
smoke marijuana i don't have dreams yeah

93
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,598
and when i quit using marijuana after a

94
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,799
couple of days oh yeah i start to have

95
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:48,878
some very vivid dreams yeah so obviously

96
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:51,040
the use of marijuana will that has

97
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:52,959
helped that is one of the worst symptoms

98
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:54,158
of ptsd

99
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,239
and

100
00:03:54,158 --> 00:03:58,719
you probably wouldn't imagine what the

101
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:02,239
second most important symptom is what's

102
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:05,438
that not being able to talk about

103
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:09,120
what was your worst experience

104
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:10,719
tell me about your worst experience

105
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,080
just like so did you feel that way after

106
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:14,959
world war ii i know you went through a

107
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,959
lot of very traumatic experiences well

108
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:20,238
my fighting your way into germany

109
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:21,680
meeting up with the russians there

110
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:24,879
my

111
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:27,280
first day i was i was

112
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:30,240
i was committed to combat

113
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:31,839
i i got uh i got an artillery artillery

114
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,000
barrage that just blew the hell out of

115
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:36,000
the little town where i was

116
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,319
and the next day they hit me with a mur

117
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,079
with a mortar barrage

118
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:42,000
and when we crossed the rhine river i

119
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:44,478
got strafed by german planes i got

120
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,879
strafed by american planes we lost 150

121
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:49,519
men in less than an hour out of how many

122
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:51,600
150 yeah part of our battalion

123
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:53,680
and a battalion is what about a thousand

124
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,040
about a thousand so 150 out of a

125
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,879
thousand yeah that's pretty heavy

126
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:00,080
attrition right

127
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:02,560
in the hour we had the

128
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:06,918
my battalion my division had the worst

129
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,918
casualties crossing the rhine river
