1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:05,318
[Applause]

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,359
next um we'd like to ask Dale gager to

3
00:00:05,318 --> 00:00:09,160
talk for a second about a new bill that

4
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:10,879
recently passed the California

5
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:13,359
legislature I think it's still pending

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,719
before the governor but it would in fact

7
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:18,399
finally do what we thought we had done

8
00:00:15,718 --> 00:00:22,278
back in 1977 which is to actually

9
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:24,278
decriminalize marijuana but as Dale will

10
00:00:22,278 --> 00:00:26,198
fill you in in more detail it turns out

11
00:00:24,278 --> 00:00:28,160
you know they're still arresting 60,000

12
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:30,960
or more marijuana smokers every year in

13
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,880
California so uh this is a major step

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,000
forward I think most of you know Dale

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:38,000
he's the coordinator and has been for a

16

18
00:00:39,878 --> 00:00:45,759
medical handbook published in uh 1997

19
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,320
and again updated in 2008 he's Vice

cannabis advocacy Dale garinger

25
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:06,200
please thank

26
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:08,599
you yes um we have actually for the

27
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:11,520
first time in many years good news

28
00:01:08,599 --> 00:01:14,478
coming out of our state legislature in

29
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:17,199
Sacramento a bill to

30
00:01:14,478 --> 00:01:19,640
decriminalize Petty possession that is

31
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:22,520
possession of less than an ounce of

32
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:25,239
marijuana to an infraction like a

33
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:27,280
traffic ticket has cleared both houses

34
00:01:25,239 --> 00:01:31,078
of the legislature and is now on the

35
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:33,759
governor's desk uh uh and our good

36
00:01:31,078 --> 00:01:37,000
friend state Senator Mark Leno deserves

37
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:40,079
credit for sponsoring this bill sp1 1449

38
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,118
it's called a a little bit of background

39
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:46,039
a lot of people think that petty

40
00:01:42,118 --> 00:01:47,399
possession is already not a criminal

41
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:49,479
offense in

42
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:51,840
California this is not actually

43
00:01:49,478 --> 00:01:54,319
technically the case technically

44
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:57,600
possession of an ounce or less is now a

45
00:01:54,319 --> 00:02:00,398
very minor misdemeanor but one which

46
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:02,478
requires you to go to court

47
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:05,478
and which in itself is quite an

48
00:02:02,478 --> 00:02:08,399
inconvenience and gives you a technical

49
00:02:05,478 --> 00:02:10,639
criminal record for a misdemeanor for

50
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:14,000
actually just two years after two years

51
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:16,919
it's expunged but the mere threat of a

52
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,199
misdemeanor charge can be a big problem

53
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:24,039
for lots of people uh and as a result

54
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:26,878
many people don't even plead out to the

55
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:29,519
maximum fine which is there's a $100

56
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:30,318
fine there's no possible jail with the

57
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:33,800
current

58
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:37,518
misdemeanor uh marijuana possession um

59
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:39,519
but uh in order to avoid the uh

60
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,759
possibility of a record a lot of people

61
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:45,039
will will spend hundreds or thousands of

62
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:47,158
dollars to go to these treatment classes

63
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:49,679
which is a diversion program that can

64
00:02:47,158 --> 00:02:52,359
avoid the technical misdemeanor

65
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,640
conviction well this is all a lot of

66
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:57,800
nonsense uh there's no other misdemeanor

67
00:02:54,639 --> 00:03:00,598
in California with that does not have a

68
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:02,719
jail sentence attached to it uh you

69
00:03:00,598 --> 00:03:04,679
shouldn't have to go to court for this

70
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:07,759
and this is costing the state quite a

71
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:09,920
bit of money in fact if you got 60,000

72
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:13,560
Petty possession offenders last year in

73
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:15,719
California that's 60,000 court cases uh

74
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,840
I don't know how much uh a court hearing

75
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:20,158
costs in fact the state court system

76
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,360
doesn't know either but it's somewhere

77
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:24,318
in the hundreds of dollars so the the

78
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:27,000
you you can tell right off the bat the

79
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:28,759
state is spending millions of dollars on

80
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,479
calling these people into court

81
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:34,000
needlessly

82
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:37,639
um Senator lener Leno managed to get

83
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:41,199
support uh from the district attorneys

84
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:43,878
and the courts California court system

85
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:45,318
for this bill in fact I think it is the

86
00:03:43,878 --> 00:03:47,798
support of the district attorneys that

87
00:03:45,318 --> 00:03:49,399
made it possible to pass the bill in the

88
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:52,760
first place because identical

89
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:56,000
legislation has been up to the uh State

90
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:58,798
Legislature three times in the last

91
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,799
dozen years or so and never managed to

92
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:03,519
pass out this is the first time it

93
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:05,400
passed out but given the fiscal crisis

94
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,759
and given that it does save millions of

95
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:10,680
dollars in quarter expenses and would

96
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:14,078
save marijuana offenders any criminal

97
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:16,519
record whatsoever for petty possession

98
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:20,358
there's a really strong case for this to

99
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:23,000
be signed into law we are crossing our

100
00:04:20,358 --> 00:04:26,279
fingers uh Governor Schwarzenegger does

101
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,560
not have a good record on marijuana

102
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:30,119
legislation in fact he has vetoed every

103
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,360
bill that we wanted

104
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,759
uh while Governor however with the

105
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:36,240
support of the district attorneys and

106
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:38,919
courts and with the with the budget

107
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,120
crisis we have we think there's a very

108
00:04:38,918 --> 00:04:43,918
very strong case now for the governor to

109
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,959
sign this bill we are urging everybody

110
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:48,279
to contact the Governor Schwarzenegger

111
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:51,680
you can do so via the normal or

112
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:54,159
California normal websites we shall know

113
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,840
by uh the end of the month what the

114
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,600
verdict is uh let me say that this if it

115
00:04:56,839 --> 00:05:01,478
does pass that is signed into law it

116
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:05,800
will also have uh nice implications for

117
00:05:01,478 --> 00:05:09,719
proposition 19 because uh uh without it

118
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:12,319
uh if proposition 19 passes petty petty

119
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:14,680
uh marijuana fences like using marijuana

120
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:17,439
in public or in front of children would

121
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:19,759
remain a misdemeanor under Prop 19 but

122
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:21,439
if the Leno bill passes it would only be

123
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:24,240
a fraction and there would be no cause

124
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:28,478
for criminal action so let's hope that

125
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:31,478
the governor signs sp1 1449 thank

126
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:31,478
you
