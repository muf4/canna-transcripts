4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,080
I know that you've been involved with

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,920
trying to help get it legal here because

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,559
I know a couple of years ago you did the

7
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:17,879
OCTA tour and now you're here for

8
00:00:15,558 --> 00:00:19,519
hempstock I want to thank you uh

9
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:21,559
anything you want to tell people that

10
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:24,559
you might know well I played the

11
00:00:21,559 --> 00:00:25,879
original uh Hempfest up in Seattle too

12
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:28,278
and I've played most of those throughout

13
00:00:25,879 --> 00:00:30,759
the years I've known Vivian for for ages

14
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:33,039
uh he's one of the most interestingly

15
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:37,079
direct action constructive people that I

16
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:40,159
know um I'm you know I'm from the 60s

17
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:42,679
generation you know and so I I kind of

18
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:44,640
came of age in in in the era when people

19
00:00:42,679 --> 00:00:47,039
were challenging all kinds of

20
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,320
prohibitions you know and I'm a musician

21
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,920
which means I've been around all sorts

22
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,480
of substance abuses including mostly

23
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:55,039
alcohol and we know what that does I've

24
00:00:53,479 --> 00:00:57,038
seen what that does I've seen the

25
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,679
casualties over and over for years in

26
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,600
the music community and in the civilian

27
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:01,799
Community associated with music and so

28
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,280
on and so on and so

29
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:06,000
on and you know it's a broken record to

30
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:08,680
say over and over again that that

31
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,239
cannabis smoking it eating it whatever I

32
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:13,799
mean the worst I've ever seen is

33
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:16,039
somebody might go to sleep you know or

34
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:17,600
they might start seeing little little

35
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:19,240
sparkly things and talk about flying

36
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:20,519
sausage or something that's it they're

37
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:22,399
not going to get into fist fights they

38
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:24,920
don't get loud they don't steal your

39
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,640
stuff I mean it's just it's completely

40
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:30,400
different and once you start to get into

41
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:32,840
the wise and Wares of the pro ition and

42
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,320
things were changed and locked away it

43
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:36,840
just starts to be kind of boringly the

44
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:39,078
same as everything else in this country

45
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,759
that gets hidden away and and keep and

46
00:01:39,078 --> 00:01:44,279
kept out of our grasp so if we can get

47
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,280
actually close to changing it I think

48
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,960
that's fabulous if we

49
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:50,399
can I

50
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:52,639
mean I've learned to expect the worst

51
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,239
but I would love to see the best you

52
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,560
know I personally think that people are

53
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:56,879
better than we than we're allowed to

54
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,519
think smarter than we're allowed to

55
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:02,078
think more generous than we're allowed

56
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:05,239
to think okay I think we can do this

57
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:07,118
I I'm always prepared for that big let

58
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:08,519
down but I think I got my fingers

59
00:02:07,118 --> 00:02:10,758
crossed on this one it really looks good

60
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,080
it really looks good yes I I know that

61
00:02:10,758 --> 00:02:15,039
uh measure 80 would here in Oregon we

62
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:18,200
have the opportunity to make it legal

63
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:20,239
for recreational use amongst adults we

64
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:21,958
were the first state to decriminalize

65
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,239
and look where it came so if we can pass

66
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:26,800
this and make it legal in Oregon no no

67
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,000
telling where it's going to go to uh I

68
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,120
hope I think you might have already

69
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,400
answered this but I always ask everybody

70
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,200
this one question if you could say

71
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:39,000
anything to the marijuana Community what

72
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:40,878
would you say um I would say uh walk I I

73
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,759
I what would I say I would say keep

74
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:45,000
going I I I would say don't make a fool

75
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:47,919
of yourself I would say don't don't you

76
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,080
know don't be confrontational but keep

77
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:52,719
going keep going don't let people shut

78
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,879
you up okay don't let people put you

79
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:55,919
down don't let people tell you how

80
00:02:53,878 --> 00:02:58,560
stupid you are any of those things keep

81
00:02:55,919 --> 00:03:02,518
going cuz it's a totally sensible thing

82
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:05,799
to do let me ask you question okay when

83
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:07,640
it was decriminalized so to speak here

84
00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:09,680
in or in Oregon did the murder rate go

85
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:12,000
up

86
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:15,560
no that's

87
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:19,439
it actually actually uh uh violent crime

88
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:21,439
actually came down yeah so uh anything

89
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:23,359
that you think your fans would like to

90
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:26,239
know where you going to be in the future

91
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,920
or well I'm playing all over the place

92
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:31,039
um I got I always do a a West Coast tour

93
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:32,798
up and down uh the coast like twice a

94
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:35,000
year once in the spring and once in the

95
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:37,239
fall and so I'm I'm looking forward to

96
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,039
to November is the next thing and one

97
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:41,000
thing I'd like to say which people talk

98
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:44,039
about a lot and I've said this before

99
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
but it's true um you know I'm not an

100
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:50,318
advocate of any particular use of

101
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:55,158
anything but cannabis is it's it's an

102
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:58,560
unlocking agent among other things

103
00:03:55,158 --> 00:04:00,479
and can I be blunt yes okay the first

104
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:04,759
time I took acid

105
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:07,639
okay way back when the funny because

106
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:09,000
that acid makes you laugh okay it make

107
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:11,639
it doesn't allow you to it makes you

108
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,799
laugh okay you will laugh and the thing

109
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:16,798
that is the most funny that I remember

110
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:18,720
is pomposity pomposity is the funniest

111
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:22,239
thing on the planet once you learn to

112
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,560
laugh at pomposity the game is almost up

113
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,040
you know because they can tell you what

114
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,879
to do and what to think and where to sit

115
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,400
down and and when to shut up and

116
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:29,879
everything else with their big uniforms

117
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:32,038
and their Badges and their pompousness

118
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:35,159
once you start to laugh at so all I'm

119
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:37,519
saying is that some of these things are

120
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:39,600
unlockers they unlock your creativity

121
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:43,399
they unlock your sense of humor and they

122
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:46,039
allow you to see the ludicrousness of

123
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:49,399
certain kinds of superiority okay I

124
00:04:46,038 --> 00:04:51,279
don't know how to fix guitars so I bow

125
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:53,000
to the authority in that sense of the

126
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:55,638
word of a guitar repairment when mine

127
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,160
gets broken that's the only definition

128
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:59,918
of authority that I give any any

129
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:02,479
Credence to the other one you you're not

130
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:04,120
an authority you've just got a gun you

131
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:06,639
can put me away for 10 years that's not

132
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:09,478
Authority that's P that's Force that's

133
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,680
all that is so if we can get things

134
00:05:09,478 --> 00:05:13,079
square and straight with our terminology

135
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,879
and we can learn to laugh at the right

136
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:17,439
time and we can understand that

137
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:19,279
unlocking our brains can be dangerous to

138
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:22,038
some other people now we understand why

139
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:24,478
they don't like us I think we'll be fine

140
00:05:22,038 --> 00:05:25,918
we just keep going we allow people to

141
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:28,680
slowly but surely understand that we're

142
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:30,198
not endangering them the murder rate

143
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,560
isn't going to go up the world isn't

144
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:33,120
going to fall apart the Earth isn't

145
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:35,038
going to get hit with asteroids the

146
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,639
dinosaurs aren't going to come back all

147
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:40,719
of a sudden it's going to go on you know

148
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:44,720
we might even get some constructive

149
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:47,440
things done okay very nice guys again
