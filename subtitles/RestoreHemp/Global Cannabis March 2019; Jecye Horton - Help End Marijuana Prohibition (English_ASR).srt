1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,160
all right what a beautiful day and I'm

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:07,290
really happy to be here who here

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:10,009
believes that everybody can have access

4
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:13,230
to cannabis

5
00:00:10,009 --> 00:00:14,669
no matter your political affiliation no

6
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:17,699
matter your race no matter your

7
00:00:14,669 --> 00:00:20,278
ethnicity no matter how old you are no

8
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:22,859
matter how young you are right everybody

9
00:00:20,278 --> 00:00:24,448
should have access to cannabis now who

10
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:26,580
thinks everyone should have access to

11
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:30,449
the best cannabis in the world like here

12
00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:32,399
in Portland this is without a doubt the

13
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:35,340
best cannabis I've traveled all around

14
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,829
the world and Portland has the best

15
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:40,050
cannabis in the world but when I was in

16
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:42,509
the South when I was in the southern USA

17
00:00:40,049 --> 00:00:45,359
we don't have laws that are quite as

18
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:48,869
liberal as they are in Portland my

19
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:51,840
father spent seven years in prison for

20
00:00:48,869 --> 00:00:54,030
an ounce of cannabis before he was going

21
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,670
to get into the top college in North

22
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:59,670
Carolina and ended up having to come out

23
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:01,590
and become a janitor and every year he

24
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:04,500
worked worked up with our family we

25
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:06,210
moved to another city and when I finally

26
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,659
got a chance to have cannabis when I

27
00:01:06,209 --> 00:01:12,089
finally got a chance to experience it I

28
00:01:08,659 --> 00:01:14,850
ended up getting arrested too I was

29
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:17,609
arrested a total of four times for

30
00:01:14,849 --> 00:01:20,129
cannabis possession one time even for a

31
00:01:17,609 --> 00:01:22,289
seat I was arrested to spend two nights

32
00:01:20,129 --> 00:01:25,140
in prison two nights in jail what I

33
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:27,690
never got a chance to go to prison

34
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:29,159
so when people in our community and

35
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:31,859
communities that have been highly

36
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:32,969
impacted by cannabis prohibition are

37
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:34,769
very bitter

38
00:01:32,969 --> 00:01:36,629
how to look at the cannabis industry is

39
00:01:34,769 --> 00:01:39,209
something that is not for them something

40
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:41,579
that will not help them and we all know

41
00:01:39,209 --> 00:01:43,739
that everyone having access to the best

42
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:45,989
cannabis there's something that will

43
00:01:43,739 --> 00:01:48,390
help them so when I finally got a chance

44
00:01:45,989 --> 00:01:50,359
to move to Portland and finally got a

45
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:54,689
chance to consume cannabis without

46
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:56,159
getting arrested I wanted to learn more

47
00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:58,859
about growing I wanted to learn more

48
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,990
about the industry and it was the people

49
00:01:58,859 --> 00:02:03,840
of Portland that opened up their doors

50
00:02:00,989 --> 00:02:06,329
opened up their programs opened up their

51
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,569
their grow shops their knowledge to

52
00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:12,060
teach me how to grow the best cannabis

53
00:02:09,569 --> 00:02:14,090
in the world and we started loud

54
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:16,439
cannabis here in Portland Oregon

55
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:19,140
contributing to the craft cannabis story

56
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:21,239
he reportedly but if you're in the

57
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:24,359
cannabis industry if you're benefitting

58
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:26,580
from the cannabis industry you cannot do

59
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:29,090
it without understanding the history of

60
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:32,219
the industry you cannot do it without

61
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:34,920
contributing to the people who have paid

62
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:37,109
that sacrifice and I've opened up for

63
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:39,899
legalization actually happened we never

64
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:41,579
thought legalization was a real thing in

65
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,739
the south we never thought it could

66
00:02:41,579 --> 00:02:47,280
happen but it's here and it's here

67
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:48,959
because of all of those people so each

68
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,539
and every one of us no matter whether

69
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:53,340
you're going to a dispensary no matter

70
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:56,250
whether you're contributing and buying

71
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:59,879
from your your local grower you have to

72
00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:01,620
find a way to help alleviate some of the

73
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:05,039
issues that have been caused through

74
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:06,870
cannabis prohibition and one way to do

75
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:10,019
that is to work with the new leaf

76
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:12,330
project here in Portland Oregon

77
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:15,469
more than was the first city in the

78
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:19,020
country I want to say that one more time

79
00:03:15,469 --> 00:03:21,689
Portland was the first city in the

80
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:24,480
country to open up some of these

81
00:03:21,689 --> 00:03:26,990
cannabis tax to help people who have

82
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:30,000
been targeted by cannabis prohibition

83
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:32,460
you got to think about how monumental

84
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,039
that is for a city to open up and become

85
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:38,070
the first and it's happening all across

86
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:40,519
the country because of what Portland has

87
00:03:38,069 --> 00:03:42,959
done and as a result of that

88
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:45,390
organizations like the new leaf project

89
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:47,340
that my wife Jeanette Ward is running

90
00:03:45,389 --> 00:03:50,039
and I'm helping with and so many other

91
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:52,349
Portland City citizens are supporting is

92
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:54,569
opening up and helping with expungement

93
00:03:52,349 --> 00:03:56,729
opportunities is helping to give grants

94
00:03:54,569 --> 00:03:59,359
to black owned and minority-owned

95
00:03:56,729 --> 00:04:02,609
cannabis businesses it's helping to

96
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:05,280
contribute to that history and alleviate

97
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:07,740
that history that has been caused now

98
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,689
there is a long way to go without a

99
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:12,360
doubt there is a lot that we have to do

100
00:04:09,689 --> 00:04:15,329
well what I want everybody here to think

101
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:19,139
about is I leave the stage here is how

102
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:20,790
am I going to contribute to helping

103
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:23,069
these issues that have been caused by

104
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:25,890
cannabis prohibition am I going to

105
00:04:23,069 --> 00:04:27,689

to make these movements like green how

107

state of Oregon
