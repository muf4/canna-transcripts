dcom because we want to we're anyway

10
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:28,640
some of us work of this attitude that

11
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:31,759
it's time to seriously consider hemp as

12
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:34,120
Alternative Energy with its own identity

13
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:36,159
that we know where we're at with the pot

14
00:00:34,119 --> 00:00:37,759
and the medical marijuana but hemp is

15
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:40,519
Earth medicine it's medicine for the

16
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:42,960
Earth and we want to see we want the THC

17
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:44,960
people all right to start saying and

18
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,558
making it known in a coherent

19
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:50,320
non-argumentative way that it's time to

20
00:00:47,558 --> 00:00:53,718
consider hemp as Alternative Energy all

21
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,320
right so this and it's not not an

22
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:56,960
organization just go out there and make

23
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,439

24
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,518
marijuana people made themselves be

25
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:02,358
listened to

26
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:04,438
the same way the gays and the lesbians

27
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:06,840
made themselves be listened to we want

28
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:08,359
the hemp people to make themselves be

29
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,719
listened to all right so if you would

30
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:13,079
check that site out all

31
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:16,158
