marijuana walk global marijuana March a

18
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:44,369
little bit of a mouthful there was the

19
00:00:41,549 --> 00:00:46,439
million marijuana March and before the

20
00:00:44,369 --> 00:00:47,788
million marijuana March as my friend

21
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:50,308

00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:08,640
worker solidarity May Day is an event

28
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:10,439
around the world where tens of thousands

29
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:14,129
hundreds of thousands of people gather

30
00:01:10,438 --> 00:01:16,109
and rally for individual rights has been

31
00:01:14,129 --> 00:01:17,759
for decades since well before the

32
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:19,319
marijuana movement started doing

33
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,969

34
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:23,099

37
00:01:25,379 --> 00:01:28,798
y'all really want to go out and have a

38
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:31,859

39
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:34,229
fun I'll stay home or I'll cover an

40
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:36,659
event that's actually going on but May

41
00:01:34,228 --> 00:01:38,459
Day now that's something special in this

42
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:40,829
country we have lost sight of that labor

43
00:01:38,459 --> 00:01:42,629
unions not being what they used to be we

44
00:01:40,828 --> 00:01:44,069
have sort of lost sight and people like

45
00:01:42,629 --> 00:01:47,879
myself who are proud to call ourselves

46
00:01:44,069 --> 00:01:49,500
socialists may not necessarily see a lot

47
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:52,978
of us out here but there are Mayday

48
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:56,280
events and for me this this is our

49
00:01:52,978 --> 00:01:58,859
Mayday this is our day to reach out in

50
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,359
solidarity with others and say we are

51
00:01:58,859 --> 00:02:03,450
your neighbors we're your friends were

52
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:05,399
your family members we smoke weed we

53
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:09,810
like weed we think that pot should be

54
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:12,120
legal and we ask you people to join with

55
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:13,439
us in calling for that it's not so we

56
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,319
can have a party

57
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:18,000
have a party anytime if it weren't for

58
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,530
legalization and drug policy or form

59
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,680
work I'd have a lot more time for

60
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:24,719
partying all right I'm doing this

61
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,719
because it's important because it's

62
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:30,449
about freedom because it's about justice

63
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:33,629
and it's because it's what's right

64
00:02:30,449 --> 00:02:35,209
social justice is where it's at

65
00:02:33,629 --> 00:02:38,250
there's a thing called harm reduction

66
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:40,409
where you try to reduce the harms that

67
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:42,509
people do to themselves and you manage

68
00:02:40,409 --> 00:02:46,829
the risks that people expose themselves

69
00:02:42,509 --> 00:02:48,419
to drinking drinking alcohol maybe just

70
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:50,750
one drink an hour so that your body

71
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:53,969
metabolizes that's called harm reduction

72
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:56,069
not taking a shot of whiskey to wash

73
00:02:53,969 --> 00:02:57,990
down your opiate that's harm reduction

74
00:02:56,069 --> 00:03:01,199
because you could kill yourself doing

75
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:03,689
that smoking marijuana to relieve your

76
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:07,619
minor pains rather than taking an opioid

77
00:03:03,689 --> 00:03:10,800
that's harm reduction okay simple

78
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:13,170
concept when we give out clean syringes

79
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,450
to people who insist on injecting drugs

80
00:03:13,169 --> 00:03:17,069
people who inject drugs are people -

81
00:03:15,449 --> 00:03:18,449
they're our friends they're our family

82
00:03:17,069 --> 00:03:20,310
members they're our sisters and our

83
00:03:18,449 --> 00:03:21,149
brothers they're our parents they're our

84
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:23,479
spouses

85
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:27,390
they're our partners they're our friends

86
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:29,759
they're people so we can either leave

87
00:03:27,389 --> 00:03:31,799
them to get sick and to die or we can do

88
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:33,599
something about it right now

89
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,010
Portland there are a handful of people

90
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,509
who've been working for a little while

91
00:03:35,009 --> 00:03:37,500
and it's getting a little bigger trying

92
00:03:36,509 --> 00:03:39,719
to put something together called a

93
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:42,060
supervised injection facility I know

94
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:44,759
little off-topic this is a weed thing

95
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:47,939
but you know we got here because the

96
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:49,560
drug policy reform and we got here

97
00:03:47,939 --> 00:03:53,009
because people are willing to break the

98
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:54,449
law to do what they think is right now

99
00:03:53,009 --> 00:03:56,609
we have a syringe exchange that's run by

100
00:03:54,449 --> 00:03:58,889
the county in this area Multnomah County

101
00:03:56,610 --> 00:04:00,750
a wonderful thing but we need more

102
00:03:58,889 --> 00:04:03,089
because the overdose crisis and because

103
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:04,680
really resources just being outstripped

104
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:06,750
so a lot of folks are working to get

105
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,939
this area to consider a supervised to

106
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:12,539
consumption facility a safe consumption

107
00:04:08,939 --> 00:04:15,269
space a safe injection facility the city

108
00:04:12,539 --> 00:04:17,488
of New York is running close King County

109
00:04:15,269 --> 00:04:19,139
Seattle is trying they're trying to get

110
00:04:17,488 --> 00:04:20,939
this done in San Francisco they hope to

111
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:25,589
have it in fact by sometime this summer

112
00:04:20,939 --> 00:04:26,519
down in San Francisco Portland it's our

113
00:04:25,589 --> 00:04:28,529
turn

114
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:30,180
we've been a leader in all this stuff

115
00:04:28,529 --> 00:04:32,369
we've been a leader in marijuana

116
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:34,199
legalization in medical marijuana and in

117
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:36,329
harm reduction for a very long time it's

118
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:38,490
because people like you come out to

119
00:04:36,329 --> 00:04:42,300
events like this and let elected leaders

120
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:45,449
and officials and just these I'll be

121
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:48,030
nice people in places like Studio on the

122
00:04:45,449 --> 00:04:50,939
square we let them know that we really

123
00:04:48,029 --> 00:04:52,439
are serious that we want this stuff to

124
00:04:50,939 --> 00:04:55,110
change and we're not going to go away

125
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:56,339
until it's happened and frankly we're

126
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:57,629
still going to be here because it's

127
00:04:56,339 --> 00:04:58,918
still not going to be perfect and

128
00:04:57,629 --> 00:05:02,279
there's still a lot of work to be done

129
00:04:58,918 --> 00:05:04,079
sure we have medical but god help you if

130
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:06,059
you live in an apartment or federally

131
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:10,198
subsidized housing sure we have

132
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:12,569
legalization of course do be careful if

133
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:15,090
you try and consume out here because

134
00:05:12,569 --> 00:05:16,919
it's illegal to consume in public and

135
00:05:15,089 --> 00:05:23,008
there are very likely people who would

136
00:05:16,918 --> 00:05:24,750
have you arrested so you know okay I'm

137
00:05:23,009 --> 00:05:27,240
gonna get through and wrap this up in a

138
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:28,860
second so here's the thing marijuana

139
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,750
legalization is a great thing drug

140
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:34,889
decriminalization is absolutely vital

141
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:38,098
harm reduction is important all this

142
00:05:34,889 --> 00:05:39,689
stuff is why I do what I do I volunteer

143
