00:00:29,309 --> 00:00:36,299

10
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:39,569
extract cannabis oil or feek oh I will

11

not be delivering a speech today it is

12
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:44,730
more like an impassioned plea for help

13
00:00:42,469 --> 00:00:46,739
first I would like to pay homage to

14
00:00:44,729 --> 00:00:49,738
those people that have fought so hard

15
00:00:46,738 --> 00:00:52,799
for so long to get cannabis where it is

16
00:00:49,738 --> 00:00:55,669
today today I want to talk about the

17
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:58,738
importance of education and awareness

18
00:00:55,670 --> 00:01:02,280
showing up to events like this helps

19
00:00:58,738 --> 00:01:04,890
show community support and unity it also

20
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:08,460
shows that we are peaceful and organized

21
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:10,319
people to be aware means taking

22
00:01:08,459 --> 00:01:13,469
advantage of times you can talk about

23
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:16,289
your positive experiences with cannabis

24
00:01:13,469 --> 00:01:19,978
to your doctors and nurses very

25
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:23,490
important there folks or even government

26
00:01:19,978 --> 00:01:27,000
officials next I want to talk about

27
00:01:23,489 --> 00:01:30,089
compassion and human suffering there are

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,030
so many average everyday people just

29
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:36,478
like you and me they have serious

30
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:40,379
illnesses these people deserve a quality

31
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:42,420
of life the same as everyone else we

32
00:01:40,379 --> 00:01:45,209
need to show the people who make the

33
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:47,879
laws in this country that we care about

34
00:01:45,209 --> 00:01:50,188
the suffering of others and write them

35
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:52,849
an email or even phone call to your

36
00:01:50,188 --> 00:01:55,379
state or federal representative

37
00:01:52,849 --> 00:01:58,078
reminding them that people are in need

38
00:01:55,379 --> 00:02:04,319
of this medicine and we want research

39
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:07,228
for cannabis now we have done such great

40
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:10,500
work so far and now we need to press for

41
00:02:07,228 --> 00:02:12,759
the medical research to be done today I

42
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:16,079
want to talk about human rights in the

43
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:18,609
fact that we are all created equal I

44
00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:22,390
want to talk about our right to choose

45
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:24,879
what medicine works best for us and I'm

46
00:02:22,389 --> 00:02:27,458
not saying all pharmaceuticals are bad

47
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:29,919
or harmful I'm just saying I should have

48
00:02:27,459 --> 00:02:33,870
the same right to choose natural grown

49
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:36,488
and made medicine as everybody else I

50
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:39,120
want to talk about the average everyday

51
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:41,170
person just trying to get by day by day

52
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,810
and I want to talk about the average

53
00:02:41,169 --> 00:02:46,869
person living with a serious illness in

54
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:47,500
a non legal state trying to make it day

55
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:50,709
by day

56
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:53,318
I want to talk about community that

57
00:02:50,709 --> 00:02:56,049
works together to change laws and help

58
00:02:53,318 --> 00:02:58,988
each other out when we can to show

59
00:02:56,049 --> 00:03:01,540
kindness and respect for each other

60
00:02:58,989 --> 00:03:03,219
I'm here as a reminder that there are

61
00:03:01,539 --> 00:03:06,669
people with certain illnesses that have

62
00:03:03,219 --> 00:03:10,479
no choice as to what medicine works for

63
00:03:06,669 --> 00:03:12,388
them cannabis as it turns out is the

64
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:14,798
only thing known to man that

65
00:03:12,389 --> 00:03:18,250
successfully treats the rare brain

66
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:23,949
disease I have I don't have a choice and

67
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:26,500
to be judged for it not human tell as

68
00:03:23,949 --> 00:03:29,919
