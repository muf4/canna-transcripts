1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
well so we're going to taking a pretty

2
00:00:02,158 --> 00:00:05,849
unique approach compared to the other

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,429
states that have approved that have

4
00:00:05,849 --> 00:00:12,689
packaging and labeling Oregon has taken

5
00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:14,490
a model more like alcohol on and when on

6
00:00:12,689 --> 00:00:16,618
every bottle of beer you have and every

7
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:19,439
wine you know every bottle of wine and

8
00:00:16,618 --> 00:00:21,420
every distilled spirit and drink those

9
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:24,750
labels all have to be approved family by

10
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:26,220
the ttv on in Washington DC ahead of

11
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:27,960
time before they can go out onto the

12
00:00:26,219 --> 00:00:30,178
shelf and before they can go out into

13
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:33,960
the stream of Commerce what we noticed

14
00:00:30,178 --> 00:00:36,030
in other states was that packaging and

15
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,829
labeling we're coming forth and then

16
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:39,808
there'd have to be recalls or people

17
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:42,750
would publicly complain because it was

18
00:00:39,808 --> 00:00:44,488
attractive to children or you know these

19
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:47,039
curtain characters of bright colors or

20
00:00:44,488 --> 00:00:48,599
they did you know more things were

21
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,149
happening and people were cutting the

22
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:53,640
edge related to what the packaging and

23
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:56,219
labeling rules approved so in Oregon we

24
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,770
triple a model more like alcohol so in

25
00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:01,710
Oregon and if you have an interest in

26
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:04,500
this you can go to marijuana Oregon gov

27
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:06,868
and look it up but on labeling its

28
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,909
labeling guy and checklist and there's a

29
00:01:06,868 --> 00:01:11,489
whole checklist there off of the order

30
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:13,080
transit or practitioners but what we

31
00:01:11,489 --> 00:01:14,908
view is we have a pre-approved label

32
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:17,250
process for our labeling and packaging

33
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:19,500
in Oregon so we don't run into some of

34
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:21,450
those same problems so we know what the

35
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,909
labels are we know what the packaging is

36
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:26,700
that we're signing every package and

37
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:30,509
label a unique ID number so that into

38
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:32,700
the future you know I I would agree with

39
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:34,290
the congressman that the pics are moving

40
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,759
very very quickly there are five states

41
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:37,350
in the country right now that are

42
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,180
looking to approve recreational

43
00:01:37,349 --> 00:01:42,899
marijuana like Oregon those are

44
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:45,118
Massachusetts Maine Nevada Arizona in

45
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:47,250
the state of California so there's five

46
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:50,099
measures on the ballot this November

47
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:53,069
what we're trying to do is you know we

48
00:01:50,099 --> 00:01:55,019
know that our oregon marketplace is very

49
00:01:53,069 --> 00:01:56,699
small we think the market for marijuana

50
00:01:55,019 --> 00:01:59,368
in oregon is about five hundred and

51
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,549
twenty thousand people after you take

52
00:01:59,368 --> 00:02:04,480
off people who

53
00:02:00,549 --> 00:02:07,479
you know who were underage and you and

54
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:08,890
you consider those people who in all the

55
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:11,259
surveys have said they're never going to

56
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:13,359
use marijuana or they don't use alcohol

57
00:02:11,259 --> 00:02:14,649
today or they don't use tobacco we've

58
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,880
tried to look at that model there's only

59
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:17,620
about five hundred twenty thousand

60
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:20,169
people so we know that at some point

61
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:22,750
time what probably is going to happen I

62
00:02:20,169 --> 00:02:25,479
believe is that you know we're going to

63
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:27,430
we're going to open up for retail

64
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:30,399
legalization at some point in time

65
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:34,540
Oregon has been a long time exporter of

66
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:37,240
marijuana I for people who you know Noel

67
00:02:34,539 --> 00:02:39,429
mentioned it I was that I was the lead

68
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:42,189
drug prosecutor in Jackson County 20

69
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:44,830
years ago so some of the people i saw

70
00:02:42,189 --> 00:02:47,800
the forum when i was doing the marijuana

71
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:49,090
thing i had busted 20 years ago very

72
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:52,780
prosecutor and we had a great

73
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:54,250
relationship but yeah well but we got

74
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:56,650
along fine so we've tried to make our

75
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:58,599
packaging and labeling to the extent

76
00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:00,430
that we have a catalog of what those

77
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:02,590
packaging labels are that there's a

78
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:04,390
unique identifier just like when you go

79
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:07,330
to the supermarket you have a unique bar

80
00:03:04,389 --> 00:03:09,219
code that gets done for that product

81
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:11,260
that's sold across the nation we're

82
00:03:09,219 --> 00:03:13,209
trying to establish that in Oregon we're

83
00:03:11,259 --> 00:03:15,489
not developing we don't have a bunch of

84
00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:18,370
people downstairs president side of this

85
00:03:15,489 --> 00:03:22,209
is childproof or not we're we've adopted

86
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:24,730
federal child proofing and child

87
00:03:22,209 --> 00:03:26,259
resistant packaging standards that have

88
00:03:24,729 --> 00:03:27,819
already been regulated at the federal

89
00:03:26,259 --> 00:03:30,009
level and we're saying you've got to go

90
00:03:27,819 --> 00:03:32,169
get that federal certification and the

91
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:34,090
reason we're doing that and it may be a

92
00:03:32,169 --> 00:03:36,280
little bit more expensive for people now

93
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:39,520
is we're trying to build for a market

94
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:41,419
that make sure that you know that we're

95
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,890
thinking towards the future in terms

96
00:03:41,419 --> 00:03:45,259
what we're doing that we've got

97
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:47,119
objectivity we've got labeling we've got

98
00:03:45,259 --> 00:03:51,139
packaging you've got all those things in

99
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:55,099
place to make a difference today we do

100
00:03:51,139 --> 00:03:57,529
have about 550 approved packages and

101
00:03:55,098 --> 00:04:00,560
then we have got two or 46 approved

102
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:03,800
labels in the state of Oregon it costs a

103
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:06,199
hundred dollars to submit a label or a

104
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:09,380
package for pre-approval we're pretty

105
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:11,119
much caught up with those we're right on

106
00:04:09,379 --> 00:04:13,068
target with those but what I would tell

107
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,319
you was you know we have this October

108
00:04:13,068 --> 00:04:17,629
first deadline I think September fifth

109
00:04:15,318 --> 00:04:20,060
we only got like 50 approved and then we

110
00:04:17,629 --> 00:04:23,930
got this massive flood of people at the

111
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:26,089
last minute I look like Dave like they

112
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:30,379
said their people are trying to catch up

113
00:04:26,089 --> 00:04:32,659
they're not used to to a process they're

114
00:04:30,379 --> 00:04:34,069
they're new to bringing these bringing

115
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:35,270
this product to market but we've been

116
00:04:34,069 --> 00:04:38,120
able to catch up we've been able to

117
00:04:35,269 --> 00:04:40,159
stack up and do those things there was

118
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:43,399
some controversy related to you know

119
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:45,169
strains of marijuana people have to get

120
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:47,389
used to those things that don't appeal

121
00:04:45,168 --> 00:04:49,519
the miners I mean basically I think

122
00:04:47,389 --> 00:04:52,579
gotta bail out of a list of I don't know

123
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:54,288
500 plus that the Commission went

124
00:04:52,579 --> 00:04:56,779
through just initially on popular strays

125
00:04:54,288 --> 00:04:57,860
we have like 20 less than 20 in the

126
00:04:56,779 --> 00:05:00,859
quarry what were some of those names

127
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:04,189
that you ended up some of the names that

128
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:07,788
that we use were like girl scout cookies

129
00:05:04,189 --> 00:05:11,779
ah Grape Ape which was a you know

130
00:05:07,788 --> 00:05:13,939
cartoon show you know we annually and we

131
00:05:11,779 --> 00:05:18,049
would general we've rejected those

132
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:20,240
yeah we rejected those and not only what

133
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:22,400
they have you know it's not our job to

134
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,990
enforce copyright trademark stuff they

135
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:26,089
all have copyright trademark problems

136
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:28,129
begin with but we just don't want you

137
00:05:26,089 --> 00:05:31,819
know we said use your concepts walk

138
00:05:28,129 --> 00:05:33,139
through your local toy store and if

139
00:05:31,819 --> 00:05:36,259
there's something in there that have the

140
00:05:33,139 --> 00:05:38,240
same label as marijuana then don't call

141
00:05:36,259 --> 00:05:40,490
your strain of marijuana them I mean

142
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,829
that's pretty simple and every single

143
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:46,610
one of those things was like that that

144
00:05:42,829 --> 00:05:48,680
we've rejected so for Smurfs I mean you

145
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:50,600
know there's a trademark drugs you know

146
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:52,459
so there's all these things out there

147
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:55,010
but we just want people to use common

148
00:05:52,459 --> 00:05:56,719
sense and I you know what we've told the

149
00:05:55,009 --> 00:05:58,969
industry when we've got to push back is

150
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,470
do you want the industry to mature or do

151
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:02,990
you not want to ensure if you wanted to

152
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:04,400
ensure don't need juvenile and in the

153
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:06,590
look in the label choices you have

154
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:08,719
because it's not intended for jummah its

155
00:06:06,589 --> 00:06:11,389
intended for adults so treatment like an

156
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,830
adult product so I think that's been

157
00:06:11,389 --> 00:06:14,089
pretty satisfying to those people we

158
00:06:12,829 --> 00:06:16,069
frankly haven't gotten bunch of push

159
00:06:14,089 --> 00:06:17,449
back in terms of what we've rejected but

160
00:06:16,069 --> 00:06:19,339
that's kind of where we're going with

161
00:06:17,449 --> 00:06:21,709
packaging labeling if again if you want

162
00:06:19,339 --> 00:06:23,989
the mechanics go to marijuana or again

163
00:06:21,709 --> 00:06:26,209
guv and that's strength of a single

164
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:29,329
portal site state of Oregon to learn

165
00:06:26,209 --> 00:06:32,810
about what goes on with marijuana we

166
00:06:29,329 --> 00:06:34,849
launched that I think within 36 hours of

167
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:36,290
the election to try and make that a

168
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:38,180
single portal site if you want to know

169
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:40,250
what here's we're having if you want to

170
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:42,829
know any of those things log onto that

171
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:44,839
site there's also a listserv that you

172
00:06:42,829 --> 00:06:46,579
can log on to what so you'll get

173
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:48,560
information about marijuana when the

174
00:06:46,579 --> 00:06:51,859
hearings are what's going on regardless

175
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:54,439
of you know what you're taking marijuana

176
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:56,210
maybe it's subjective and it's just this

177
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:59,079
is what governments doing if you want to

178
00:06:56,209 --> 00:07:01,639
be involved on you know be involved in

179
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:03,168
in hearing about what's going on we'd

180
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:04,819
like to be involved ahead of time I

181
00:07:03,168 --> 00:07:07,219
think we've done pretty good job with

182
00:07:04,819 --> 00:07:08,870
our public involvement piece I was

183
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:12,140
amazed when we had our hearings on

184
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:13,730
public involvement we've scheduled like

185
00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:15,168
four and a half hours for here as we

186
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:16,720
were done in an hour and a half we

187
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:20,240
didn't have anybody sitting in the queue

188
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:22,520
waiting to testify and I've been doing

189
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,379
public process for 20-plus years and

190
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:26,959
that rarely ever happens they died

191
00:07:24,379 --> 00:07:30,409
exhausting but you had an extensive

192
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:32,779
array of me we didn't understand

193
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:34,840
absolutely we did it ahead of time so I

194
00:07:32,779 --> 00:07:37,219
was glad we weren't at the west entrance

195
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:39,529
we appreciate the concrete parchment

196
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:41,360
anticipated with us all these guys all

197
00:07:39,529 --> 00:07:44,000
have participated with us the whole time

198
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:46,449
to make it open to everybody huddle

199
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,189
truck people for law enforcement for

200
00:07:46,449 --> 00:07:52,990
marijuana advocates or you know all

201
00:07:49,189 --> 00:07:52,990
kinds of people to come to the table
