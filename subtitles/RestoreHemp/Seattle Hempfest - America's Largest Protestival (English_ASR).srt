00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:26,919
street I'm standing here at Hempfest in

9
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:29,158
Seattle with Keith stro the founder of

10
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,478
of normal and thank again thank you for

11
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:32,680
that and

12
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:34,560
uh what do you think of this event um

13
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:36,920
it's a it's my favorite event of the

14
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,680
year uh I travel around and do a number

15
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,560
of these kinds of things but there's

16
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:43,240
nothing on the scale of the Seattle

17
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,519
Hempfest other than the Seattle Hempfest

18
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:48,118
so uh for those who haven't seen it it

19
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:50,759
is incredibly empowering and I I think

20
00:01:48,118 --> 00:01:53,680
12 13 years now I've been coming and I

21
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:55,280
just uh I find it fascinating and I

22
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,240
think people in other parts of the

23
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,239
country are beginning to pick up on that

24
00:01:57,239 --> 00:02:01,919
same phenomena and the Boston Freedom

25
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:03,519
Fest is coming up in the month and

26
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,359
that's a wonderful thing on the Boston

27
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:07,798
common with all the history associated

28
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:10,919
with that um and in the the port

29
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:12,719
Portland Hima and uh that's about the

30
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:14,919
middle of next month as well I was there

33
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:22,518
