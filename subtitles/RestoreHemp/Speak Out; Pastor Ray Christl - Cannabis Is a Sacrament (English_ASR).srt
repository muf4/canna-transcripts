uh we we just really want to pray for

9
00:00:25,278 --> 00:00:30,278
Hawaiian islands and the problems we

10
00:00:27,559 --> 00:00:31,718
have associated with drug use and abuse

11
00:00:30,278 --> 00:00:34,878
in in our

12
00:00:31,719 --> 00:00:38,120
community um I for many years here in

13
00:00:34,878 --> 00:00:42,320
Maui have been the

14
00:00:38,119 --> 00:00:45,679
uh uh facilitator for people uh with

15
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:50,320
education about uh medical cannabis for

16
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:53,119
the sick and dying uh and elderly um

17
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,238
last Friday evening a week ago I was on

18
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:56,878
the dialogue show on Hawaiian public

19
00:00:55,238 --> 00:00:59,358
television which I'd like to show a tape

20
00:00:56,878 --> 00:01:01,920
of on on this cable network and I

21
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:05,198
debated the doctor in substance abuse

22
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:10,280
and uh also the DEA officer and the and

23
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:14,319
major Tano of the Hawaii uh uh Honolulu

24
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:16,439
Vice commander and uh we got into a good

25
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:18,758
discussion a loving discussion about how

26
00:01:16,438 --> 00:01:20,839
we could problem solve and the police

27
00:01:18,759 --> 00:01:22,920
admitted that they don't want people

28
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:25,640
going to jail anymore for use that those

29
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:28,879
people have become victimized by drugs

30
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:31,920
in our society and we moved the

31
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:34,039
discussion we evolved it along to where

32
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,879
we decided

33
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:39,040
that and the president has decided this

34
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:40,959
that medically we are going to deal with

35
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:44,159
the problem more than as a criminal

36
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:45,959
justice incarceration problem so people

37
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,920
need to start taking the fear out of

38
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:51,199
their lives about using and people they

39
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:52,840
see using drugs and we have to start

40
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,520
using the church and the medical

41
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:59,560
community to solve

42
00:01:55,519 --> 00:02:02,399
problems um if you are in Maui County

43
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:04,600
and you are in need of Education about

44
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:07,920
medical cannabis I want you to call my

45
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:11,359
office and there is a defense that was

46
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,159
mentioned in the show uh it's Penal Code

47
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,360
uh this is Hawaii penal code for 20

48
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:16,799
years it's been buried in the penal code

49
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,800
and it's uh

50
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:22,760
72-12 4-1 it's a defense to promotion

51
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,000
what it basically boils down to is if

52
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:28,479
you're a medical need and your doctor

53
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,439
will prescribe medicine of of marijuana

54
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:33,280
for you that that as a practitioner as a

55
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:35,878
religious practitioner and a pastor in a

56
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,719
church we have a defense me as a

57
00:02:35,878 --> 00:02:40,959
facilitator in education to teach you

58
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:43,598
how to grow it in your house and you as

59
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,800

liberty and the pursuit of happiness and

61
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:50,519
to heal yourself that's our basic most

62
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:52,679
human right we have and so there's a

63
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:56,680
defense in the law and this is the state

64
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:59,439
law and um we will help you in every way

65
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:00,959
possible on this uh very quickly there's

66
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:03,919
books that I would like you to be

67
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:07,439
cognizant of and this is what we always

68
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:09,759
like to talk about is is that in the

69
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:11,878
United States every year from tobacco

70
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:14,840
which is a very addictive substance and

71
00:03:11,878 --> 00:03:18,000
and causes Devastation of 3 to 400,000

72
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:20,360
deaths alcohol is devastating and we

73
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,360
know that Jesus made the wine at the

74
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:26,760
wedding feast and made drugs as his

75
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:30,599
first miracle and and so we are free to

76
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:32,840
pursue intoxicants in in the Kingdom of

77
00:03:30,598 --> 00:03:35,039
Heaven that we're in and but still

78
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:39,479
people abuse it to the extent in America

79
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:41,239
of 150,000 deaths now marijuana has

80
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:42,759
never caused a single death in the

81
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:45,239
history of the world here according to

82
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:46,919
the doctor I debated on the dialogue and

83
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:49,080
they can't come up with a person yet

84
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:51,039
that'll say that there's uh been death

85
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:54,120
or that there's a lethal dose to

86
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:57,560
marijuana so what we're trying to do is

87
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,799
put on an armor of like a police officer

88
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,640
puts on when they're going in and

89
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,480
they're raiding uh

90
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:04,518
someone and they're putting on all this

91
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:10,000
body armor we could put on the body

92
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:13,079
armor of the law and the law has stated

93
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,079
religious use of cannabis is legalized

94
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:17,239
uh the n9th appell court has ruled this

95
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:19,439
it's the police have been cognizant of

96
00:04:17,238 --> 00:04:22,000
it for six months now they're not about

97
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:23,839
to advertise it we're not trying to Hype

98
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,759
it what we're saying is our church in

99
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:30,159
our Sacrament is religiously legal now

100
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:32,879
under the ninth appell at court and the

101
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:35,520
the freedom restoration act for religion

102
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:39,399
signed by the president in 1994 there's

103
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:41,680
also been a directive uh uh it's an

104
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:45,679
executive order by the president that

105
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:48,720
says Industrial Hemp Industrial Hemp is

106
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:53,400
a strategic food and resource for fiber

107
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:55,680
which you can make clothing canvas paper

108
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:58,679
and also that cellulose can be used to

109
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,840
make the new substance in 1936 that the

110
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:04,639
DuPont wanted to to just be made out of

111
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:07,119
coal or out of oil you can use the same

112
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:09,800
BYOD you can use the same product of

113
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,120
cellulose in the stock of the sensia in

114
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,639
other words we could be growing medical

115
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:16,759
marijuana and take the stock of it and

116
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:19,759
make plastic to build homes for

117
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:21,759
Hawaiians at very inexpensive rates or

118
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,560
we could build an automobile I could

119
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,600
show you a picture real quickly here on

120
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:27,600
page 50 of a car that Henry Ford made

121
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,560
out of cannabis I know it's hard for

122
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,919
people to believe it but here's a car

123
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,240
made out of cannabis that not only did

124
00:05:32,918 --> 00:05:37,519
Henry Ford want the car to be made out

125
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:40,519
of plastic made from hemp but he wanted

126
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:42,079
it to be run in other words the fuel

127
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:45,279
there was a process where you could

128
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:46,918
renewably take plants especially hemp

129
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:48,918
and after you take the seeds off for the

130
00:05:46,918 --> 00:05:51,719
food to feed starving people or to feed

131
00:05:48,918 --> 00:05:54,478
animals or to press that oil into the

132
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:57,080
lubricating uh lubricants for the grease

133
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:58,079
and the oil in the car so literally we

134
00:05:57,079 --> 00:06:00,560
can use

135
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:02,800
plants naturally natural resources given

136
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,519
to us by God our creator to solve

137
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:08,478
problems here in

138
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:11,159
Maui now the National Review which is

139
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:13,639
the uh publication of the conservative

140
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:16,000
right and William F Buckley who is a

141
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:17,879
scholar has come out recently this is

142
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,879
the second front page in a year where he

143
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:24,279
said yeah it's p people uh the drug the

144
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:27,879
War on Drugs is the War on Drugs really

145
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:30,638
lost and he gives 17 scholarly points in

146
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:32,759
this magazine where he feels that the

147
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:35,038
way to go is harm reduction and

148
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:38,038
immediate relaxation of laws against

149
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:40,240
cannabis for even recreational use our

150
00:06:38,038 --> 00:06:42,240
goal as a church is to convince the

151
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:45,199
state supreme court our legislature our

152
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:48,280
governor our mayor our our County

153
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:51,800
councel that cannabis must remain in

154
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:55,119
one's home in the beginning until

155
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:57,759
further uh studies are done on how

156
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:00,038
Holland has solved the problem of

157
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:03,199
differentiating hard drug use from soft

158
00:07:00,038 --> 00:07:04,839
drugs in Holland you can go in to well

159
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:08,240
there's over a thousand different they

160
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:10,318
euphemistically use the term coffee shop

161
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,879
and we know these are marijuana hashish

162
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:14,439
clubs where you go in and you smoke

163
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:16,080
either hashish which is the resins that

164
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:18,120
are collected by literally in ancient

165
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:20,439
times in India they'd have the women of

166
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:22,439
course they would be more you know or

167
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:25,000
the slaves would do this the people that

168
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:26,399
were not the the princes and the

169
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,639
religious leaders they were the

170
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:31,120
recipients of the hash oil which is

171
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:33,360
called char in in in India which is

172
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,639
sacred and they would rub the plant and

173
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:38,400
then this black gooey tar would be

174
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:40,960
rubbed into nepes Temple balls and that

175
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:43,399
was for the shaman uh the top shamans

176
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:45,560
the Priestly class the Brahman class the

177
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:47,878
sadus in India that walk around almost

178
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:50,800
butt naked in India smoking cannabis as

179
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:53,680
a religious Sacrament when they went to

180
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:56,520
Jamaica and started preaching uh to the

181
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,840
black slaves uh who also had this plant

182
00:07:56,519 --> 00:08:01,079
from Africa in their religions and from

183
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:02,799
the tri angulation from the from the

184
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:05,240
south with the Zulus and and what we

185
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:08,280
know as South Africa all the way up to

186
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:11,960
the Moroccan Keef and across to the uh

187
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:13,918
to the shamans in e in in Egypt uh the

188
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:15,120
his where the therapeut as the the

189
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:17,158
ancient where we get the word

190
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,759
Therapeutics from the ancient shamans of

191
00:08:17,158 --> 00:08:21,680
Egypt cannabis has been used for

192
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:25,319
religion and medicine since the

193
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:27,639
beginning of time in Memorial 12,000

194
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:29,319
year history and here now with the new

195
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:31,720
Machinery that we can take and make

196
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:34,800
plastic and build homes and make

197
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:36,759
furniture make automobiles run

198
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:38,519
automobiles on one single plant let

199
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:40,599
alone if we started to realize the

200
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:42,679
potential of other plants see when a

201
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:45,040
plant is is useful they give it a Latin

202
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:47,599
word by the name of sativa so Cannabis

203
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:49,838
sativa means cultivated for

204
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,720
usefulness that's what Cannabis sativa

205
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:54,360
means so for them to try to eradicate a

206
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,160
plant where they have laws against

207
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:58,720
Extinction in other words if there's

208
00:08:56,159 --> 00:09:01,000
some obscure plant like this tree here

209
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,160
that was being eradicated it's against

210
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,879
the law but all of a sudden they can fly

211
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:07,159
helicopters that go after a plant that

212
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:09,679
most of the people uh of the world in

213
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:11,399
religion has said was been a Sacrament

214
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:13,399
and that can be made into plastic and

215
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:16,399
paper so that we don't have to cut down

216
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:18,039
trees we can feed starving people we can

217
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:19,159
give medicine to people to alleviate

218
00:09:18,039 --> 00:09:21,879
their suffering because that's what

219
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:23,958
cannabis is it doesn't cure diseases it

220
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:26,958
alleviates suffering it's an analgesic

221
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:28,958
it's a comforter like the Holy Spirit it

222
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:32,159
comes on us when we need it and we pray

223
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:34,679
and the Lord is with us and it's and and

224
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:36,879
so at the time of Jesus it was very

225
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:38,919
common for Jewish women in childbirth in

226
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:40,480
fact they found a number of bodies where

227
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:42,719
the women they didn't have cesarian I

228
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:45,360
guess in those days or wasn't perfected

229
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:47,600
yet and the women died in child birth

230
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,200
and they found chunks of hashish in

231
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:52,040
their stomach and they went oh so over

232
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:54,079
time now we know in the last few years

233
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:56,199
because of Ronald Reagan saying that

234
00:09:54,078 --> 00:09:58,559
marijuana kills brain cells just like

235
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:00,120
alcohol so they did a study on it they

236
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:01,479
got them to back it up and they did a

237
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:04,519
study and what did the doctors the

238
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:06,519
scientists find they said well we found

239
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:08,399
that there's receptor sites in the brain

240
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:10,078
and we we think there's a marijuana drug

241
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,240
in the brain that we didn't know existed

242
00:10:10,078 --> 00:10:14,439
because we found these receptor sites so

243
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,919
when a person smokes marijuana It Gets

244
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,440
In The Blood it flushes over these

245
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:20,879
receptor sites that are there for some

246
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:23,560
reason and the person gets high and when

247
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:25,559
the person uh when the when the receptor

248
00:10:23,559 --> 00:10:27,278
sites are maxed out they start to shut

249
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:29,759
down so that the person starts to not

250
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:32,240
get any higher you can only get so high

251
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:33,799
you can't overdose in marijuana you

252
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,639
can't kill yourself and you can't get

253
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:37,078
any higher than what you can get and the

254
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:38,480
more you abuse it the more you're

255
00:10:37,078 --> 00:10:40,479
compulsive and the more you are a

256
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,680
chronic smoker of cannabis the more

257
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:45,560
you're just hurting yourself because you

258
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:47,599
can only what the key is this cannabis

259
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:49,199
if you use it somewhat in ritual and and

260
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,600
your in your spiritual life and you're

261
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,879
responsible you'd use it occasionally

262
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,560
maybe you need it when you come home

263
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:56,838
from work at A Hard Day's work and you

264
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:58,759
need the relief and the stress reduction

265
00:10:56,839 --> 00:11:03,240
of this that is a big killer in our

266
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:03,240
societ Society of stress and and

267
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:08,120
so on this book here let me just show

268
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:10,639
you that for a 100 years in American

269
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:12,560
history babies infants were given the

270
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:14,000
strongest tincture in other words this

271
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:16,958
hashel that I was talking about the

272
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:20,159
Charis the resin was made into a

273
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:22,039
liquid and it was given to babies and

274
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:24,078
here's our constitution made out of hemp

275
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:26,240
if this constitution stands for anything

276
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:29,319
it stands for my right to say the truth

277
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:31,519
here today our church stands for truth

278
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:35,120
if we can be out debated and and what

279
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:37,799
we're against is is lies about cannabis

280
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,759
and lying to the children if you will

281
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:41,958
allow us to talk to the children I feel

282
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:44,759
we can do everything to postpone their

283
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:47,759
their usage prematurely until if they

284
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:49,439
are so precocious because all the music

285
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:51,039
from rock and roll and jazz on up to

286
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,839
their hip hop and regga has pushed them

287
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:55,519
to want to use marijuana ma W the thing

288
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,839
that this island is most famous for in

289
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,440
this community and these islands are

290
00:11:56,839 --> 00:12:01,920
most famous for is pushed into a

291
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:05,839
forbidden fruit situation help us and

292
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:08,479
help yourself and and help your pastors

293
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:10,440
and and let's talk about this please

294
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,480
have me over at your church or at your

295
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:14,440
Civic group to talk about this and let's

296
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:17,000
Dialogue on this like that award-winning

297
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:20,320
show that I was on last Friday and help

298
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,559
public broadcasting help this station

299
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,278
because we don't get the opportunity for

300
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:26,479
for common people to come on the air to

301
00:12:24,278 --> 00:12:28,519
speak too often we're pushed away from

302
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:31,000
the media and that's a problem in this

303
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:34,480
country so all the wonderful Aloha from

306
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:42,879
Brotherhood and a Sisterhood here in the

307
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,399
Hawaiian islands that can be a beacon to

308
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:47,278
the world and we'll bring millions of

309
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:51,919
people to Hawaii to uh to share that the

310
