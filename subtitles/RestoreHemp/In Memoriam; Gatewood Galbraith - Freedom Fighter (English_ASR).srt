1
00:00:05,169 --> 00:00:10,550
I've seen we had 66 out of Kentucky 120

2
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:13,480
counties

3
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:14,740
to get your own children I guess

4
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,480
sending out one hundreds of millions of

5
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:18,368
dollars and the American public is

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,469
sending out billions of dollars in tax

7
00:00:18,368 --> 00:00:22,059
clean income to the international

8
00:00:20,469 --> 00:00:24,519
criminal syndicates in South America

9
00:00:22,059 --> 00:00:26,409
Mexico for a plant hi granddaddy used to

10
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:28,059
grow by the thousands of acres and I'm

11
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:29,379
going to redirect that money out of the

12
00:00:28,059 --> 00:00:30,788
hands these international criminal

13
00:00:29,379 --> 00:00:32,588
syndicates and I'm going to put them

14
00:00:30,789 --> 00:00:34,600
into the capital tax coffers of

15
00:00:32,588 --> 00:00:36,878
Frankfurt so I can lift the people of

20
00:00:51,859 --> 00:00:57,009
role of government in policing private

21
00:00:53,780 --> 00:01:01,039

head stuck where it's never going to

discover the thousand points of light of

39
00:01:39,739 --> 00:01:46,039
George Bush these people's idea of

40
00:01:44,269 --> 00:01:48,009
future full employment is to make half

41
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:51,109
of his prison guards male have prisons

42
00:01:48,009 --> 00:01:53,269
this man is an alien he's not a

43
00:01:51,109 --> 00:01:57,078
conservative he's an alien he and Ronald

44
00:01:53,269 --> 00:01:59,239
Reagan both they are willing to imprison

45
00:01:57,078 --> 00:02:01,069
a whole generation of people to keep

46
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:02,390
intact the petro chemical and

47
00:02:01,069 --> 00:02:04,279
pharmaceutical monopolies in this

48
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:07,399
country which he's well vested in each

49
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:08,599
point and I think he's a vampire I don't

50
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:10,489
think he's an American I think he's a

51
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:12,620
vampire willing to suck the life out all

52
00:02:10,489 --> 00:02:14,299
those victims or remain entire Foreman

53
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:15,829
in a fire for position but let me take

54
00:02:14,299 --> 00:02:18,200
this opportunity right here wherever

55
00:02:15,829 --> 00:02:20,060
this gets shown limitation I am pleased

56
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:22,310
and honored to be in presence that one

57
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:25,039
was brave man in the United sterile this

58
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:26,989
gentleman that I had his author Emperor

59
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:30,289
wears no clothes and so much more than

60
00:02:26,989 --> 00:02:33,859
just an author researcher and a

61
00:02:30,289 --> 00:02:37,129
dedicated diligent activist and a man

62
00:02:33,859 --> 00:02:39,230
who I know for a fact is responsible for

63
00:02:37,129 --> 00:02:41,030
tens of thousands of people just kind

64
00:02:39,229 --> 00:02:43,310
being able to come out of the closet

65
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:45,680
stand up out of the darkness to stand up

66
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:47,870
out of oppression and despair and lives

67
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,849
of quiet desperation and be able to

68
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:51,980
point to the source of knowledge and the

69
00:02:49,848 --> 00:02:53,530
truth and the point of light that this

70
00:02:51,979 --> 00:02:56,238
man right here is personally responsible

71
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:58,009
for putting together I would not be

72
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,870
where I am today were it not for Jack

73
00:02:58,009 --> 00:03:02,060
hair and I know that a lot of people

74
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:04,430
would not be walking tall with dignity

75
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:06,439
of a sense of pride in a sense that they

76
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:07,879
do no wrong by communicating with mother

77
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:09,650
earth through the earth and in other

78
00:03:07,878 --> 00:03:11,840
fashions and this man right here is

79
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:13,459
responsible for as much of it as I know

80
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,319
what I'm sure the people deserve credit

81
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:16,789
to a belt amount but this man right here

82
00:03:15,318 --> 00:03:18,889
is one of the most brave people in the

83
00:03:16,789 --> 00:03:21,139
United States today and I hope someday

84
00:03:18,889 --> 00:03:22,939
that this country people when it will

85
00:03:21,139 --> 00:03:25,518
reward you appropriately what he's done

86
00:03:22,939 --> 00:03:27,199
for freedom and individuality and civil

87
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,760
liberties and mother earth in this

88
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:31,250
country I want to take it up to the

89

blind hog snuff now anchored here once a

104
00:04:22,339 --> 00:04:31,609
while eh the elegance you know I think

105
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,840
Edison Edison said the genius is one

106
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:35,180

111
00:04:41,899 --> 00:04:46,370
book that i read that was one of the

112
00:04:43,459 --> 00:04:48,019
really in Michael Aldridge and written

113
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:50,209
some of the greatest work on him long

114
00:04:48,019 --> 00:04:53,418
before I really understood half though

115
00:04:50,209 --> 00:04:55,879
he wrote in 77 it contains Asia utterly

116
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:58,909
and i am the Kentucky Yahoo's marijuana

117
00:04:55,879 --> 00:05:01,159
peacebuilders to tell you a new job

118
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:03,650
here's my adolescent that man and the

119
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:05,330
perspectives you two he is not some of

120
00:05:03,649 --> 00:05:08,139
you needs to come to me to learn about

121
00:05:05,329 --> 00:05:15,439
him I learned a lot of my him from him

122
00:05:08,139 --> 00:05:17,509
born in Jack make you crazy they know

123
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:20,149
marijuana does not need you to crime

124
00:05:17,509 --> 00:05:23,209
they know marijuana does not lead you to

125
00:05:20,149 --> 00:05:26,239
harder drugs but marijuana is a system

126
00:05:23,209 --> 00:05:28,789
of control that they can exercise over

127
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:32,210
you because you step out of line from

128
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:35,210
their corporate policies this is the

129
00:05:32,209 --> 00:05:37,250
million marijuana market and today there

130
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:41,589
are demonstrations just like this in

131
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:44,420
every major city across the world I

132
00:05:41,589 --> 00:05:48,349
think that the laws against marijuana

133
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:49,879
are the most vivid illustration of where

134
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:52,780
this government's overstepped its bounds

135
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:54,040
in policing private behavior the

136
00:05:52,779 --> 00:05:57,109
petrochemical pharmaceutical

137
00:05:54,040 --> 00:06:01,520
military-industrial complex as utilized

138
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:03,080
the lawmaking powers of Congress to get

139
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:04,879
through legislation which is

140
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:06,259
criminalized the farmer who's gone into

141
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:09,409
competition with these synthetic

142
00:06:06,259 --> 00:06:11,120
manufacturers hint is the number 15

143
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:13,100
we're the number one fuel the number one

144
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:16,340
food and number one medicine so the laws

145
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:17,930
against marijuana are the most important

146
00:06:16,339 --> 00:06:19,250
step that this government special

147
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:22,790
interest have put together and put on

148
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:25,899
two people to remove them from the

149
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:25,900
natural cycle of things

150
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:41,259
we smoked pot no pot no pot unless

151
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:42,790
people actually get out in the streets

152
00:06:41,259 --> 00:06:45,939
and actually demonstrate and actually

153
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:49,780
push the envelope this first amendment

154
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:52,420
has no life I've been to these things

155
00:06:49,779 --> 00:06:54,609
when we had a 50 people I've been Adam

156
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:57,520
when we had 20,000 and I'm always

157
00:06:54,610 --> 00:07:00,240
empowered by seeing one person stand up

158
00:06:57,519 --> 00:07:02,680
and try to give life and vibrancy and

159
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,680
existence to the bill of rights in the

160
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:08,800
society we live in a police state

161
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:11,079
there's no doubt about it you can lead

162
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:14,110
this demonstration and don't get in your

163
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:16,209
car and get out on the road and they can

164
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:18,240
set up a random road block in front of

165
00:07:16,209 --> 00:07:21,310
you and make you get out of your car

166
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:23,920
bring up a dog listen if you your car

167
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:27,009

yarn make your pee in a bottle and they

169
00:07:27,009 --> 00:07:33,459

have to pee in a cup holder job in

175
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:51,848
America there is a peaceful solution

176
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:57,580
call these realm

177
00:07:51,848 --> 00:08:02,319

ready to receive it now let's take back

182
00:08:13,769 --> 00:08:22,269
having come when the war is over and we

183
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:27,040
want let's remember how we do this so we

184
00:08:22,269 --> 00:08:31,750
don't have to do it again better get

185
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:34,529
some people solution aunties

186
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,529
now let's shake

187
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:37,000
you

188
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:44,470
pardon me I don't think marijuana was a

189
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:45,879
problem back in 1937 it certainly wasn't

190
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:47,230
a problem is certainly not a problem

191
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:48,490
today and it's all over the place so I

192
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:51,340
don't know how I could possibly been a

193
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:53,169
problem in 1937 except for the fact that

194
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:54,700
when they passed that law for the first

195
00:08:53,169 --> 00:08:56,529
time federal government took over the

196
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:58,090
right to tell you what seed you could

197
00:08:56,529 --> 00:09:00,429
plant in the ground and what you could

198
00:08:58,090 --> 00:09:03,190
do with the product of that see then put

199
00:09:00,429 --> 00:09:05,289
it like this some people who don't know

200
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:07,360
me give me a reputation for wearing to

201
00:09:05,289 --> 00:09:11,980
legalize drugs I do not want to do that

202
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:16,360
I'm in the business of trying to license

203
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:18,759
and regulate cannabis as a crop tomatoes

204
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:21,580
are legal alcohol and tobacco is

205
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:23,080
licensed and regulated and I've seek to

206
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:25,629
license and regulate take it out of the

207
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:28,120
black market status just cannabis now I

208
00:09:25,629 --> 00:09:32,470
would take the law enforcement dollar

209
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:33,970
which we would save of the currently

210
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:35,920
recurrently spending on detecting

211
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:37,480
arresting prosecuting and incarcerating

212
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:39,939
people who associated with cannabis

213
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:41,379
plant if we change laws we'd save all

214
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:43,180
that money I would go after the hard

215
00:09:41,379 --> 00:09:45,700
drugs I'd go after the synthetic drugs

216
00:09:43,179 --> 00:09:48,309
to crack the cocaine heroin those kinds

217
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:51,070
of synthetic drugs man-made drugs which

218
00:09:48,309 --> 00:09:52,839
destroy the spirit and overcome rights

219
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:54,340
of determination and self choice because

220
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:56,230
they're addictive and destructive to the

221
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:58,860
body but the most insidious is the

222
00:09:56,230 --> 00:10:01,029
prescription medicines courage there are

223
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:02,980
pharmaceutical medicines as and their

224
00:10:01,029 --> 00:10:05,139
impact on society and paralyzed entire

225
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:06,339
portions of Kentucky including vast

226
00:10:05,139 --> 00:10:08,919
regions of Easter

227
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:11,980
which have no economy and Admiral jobs

228
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:14,558
and are the main sources for illicit

229
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:16,569
oxycontin or settle or tavern and these

230
00:10:14,558 --> 00:10:18,399
pharmaceutical companies are out there

231
00:10:16,568 --> 00:10:19,870
spending billions of dollars encouraging

232
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,970
as many people as they can to take this

233
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:23,379
poison and they know that it is

234
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:24,720
addictive and they know that's a huge

235
00:10:23,379 --> 00:10:27,278
black market that builds up around

236
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,689
people's necessity of continuing to take

237
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:30,759
this addictive medicine with their

238
00:10:28,688 --> 00:10:34,289
doctor stops their treatment so there is

239
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:36,278
a big black market up there and the

240
00:10:34,289 --> 00:10:38,049
pharmaceutical companies are unaware of

241
00:10:36,278 --> 00:10:39,669
it professed an opinion tablet they

242
00:10:38,049 --> 00:10:41,889
could create oxycontin so you can't

243
00:10:39,669 --> 00:10:43,269
crush enough extorting so they're aware

244
00:10:41,889 --> 00:10:44,499
of this and that they didn't do that

245
00:10:43,269 --> 00:10:46,600
this talk because they didn't want say

246
00:10:44,499 --> 00:10:48,240
pretending to happen but some because

247
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,990
they do is they had a big addiction

248
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,909
situation and they're going to sell it

249
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:54,539
out long locks continent if ever I was

250
00:10:51,909 --> 00:10:54,539
addicted to it

251
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:18,840
I'm the question of him the question of

252
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:21,029
cannabis is the most vivid illustration

253
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:23,070
of how this government has overstepped

254
00:13:21,029 --> 00:13:26,100
its bounds in policing the private

255
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:28,260
behavior citizen when they told us we

256
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:30,870
couldn't plan an empty tin the ground

257
00:13:28,259 --> 00:13:34,559
they favoured us from the natural cycle

258
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:36,960
and is what they seek to do i call it

259
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:39,239
the synthetic version or they want to

260
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:41,340
replace all the natural products on

261
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:44,659
earth they used to be grown out of God's

262
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:47,730
earth 'god seed and replace them with

263
00:13:44,659 --> 00:13:50,069
synthetic products and knock down farmer

264
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:53,610
out of the agreement society in the

265
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:55,620
grant market and they do go south of our

266
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:58,680
small cities and villages across this

267
00:13:55,620 --> 00:14:00,690
country we need to rediscover a cash

268
00:13:58,679 --> 00:14:03,299
crop yeah one day we don't have our

269
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:05,550
farmers go back to the land one day a

270
00:14:03,299 --> 00:14:08,969
little high our farmers to compete with

271
00:14:05,549 --> 00:14:11,729
the petrochemical pipelines you plant us

272
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:14,040
seven percent agricultural land in it

273
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:17,190
you wouldn't have to import another drop

274
00:14:14,039 --> 00:14:20,669
of oil we can replace the spills in the

275
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:22,980
Gulf we can replace the environmental

276
00:14:20,669 --> 00:14:25,439
catastrophe that the petroleum pipelines

277
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:28,170
that gas squad mother earth understand

278
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:32,460
let our farmers grow in and they do crop

279

I'm knowing a long time he and I believe

311
00:15:58,029 --> 00:16:02,500
the same way about a whole lot of things

312
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:04,690

Gatewood forgot thank

315
00:16:41,278 --> 00:16:52,169
I met gate when I was very impressed by

316
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:54,060
him you know we both loved cannabis and

317
00:16:52,169 --> 00:16:56,490
we would smoke out at the normal

318
00:16:54,059 --> 00:17:00,659
conferences together for a few years but

319
00:16:56,490 --> 00:17:02,999
in 1990 not September he called me and

320
00:17:00,659 --> 00:17:04,798
said willie nelson wants to meet you so

321
00:17:02,999 --> 00:17:07,019
I hung out with Willie and we got him

322
00:17:04,798 --> 00:17:10,318
some herb and he would have me roll

323
00:17:07,019 --> 00:17:12,480
joints about every 45 minutes a roll

324
00:17:10,318 --> 00:17:15,328
another one Paul roll another one Paul

325
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:18,419
and so I did then he invited me to come

326
00:17:15,328 --> 00:17:20,308
back to Kentucky in October that this

327
00:17:18,419 --> 00:17:24,299
guy gate what gah breath was running for

328
00:17:20,308 --> 00:17:28,220
governor so I flew back to Lexington

329
00:17:24,298 --> 00:17:32,009
Kentucky and had a press conference

330
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:35,279
there with Willie Nelson and Gatewood

331
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:39,150
gah breath in then they drove gate woods

332
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:42,210
red mercedes benz station wagon powered

333
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:44,519
entirely on hemp seed oil they took

334
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:46,558
pressed hemp seed oil discovered that it

335
00:17:44,519 --> 00:17:48,960
can be used as a diesel fuel they poured

336
00:17:46,558 --> 00:17:52,379
it right into the engine were able to

337
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:54,509
drive from Lexington about 50 miles to

338
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:56,460
the State Capitol in Frankfort we

339
00:17:54,509 --> 00:17:58,440
stopped at the State Capitol the

340
00:17:56,460 --> 00:18:00,720
Kentucky legislators went crazy over

341
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:03,419
Willie Nelson and we drove on about

342
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:07,288
another 80 miles on to Louisville

343
00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:09,780
Kentucky and Willie Nelson did a benefit

344
00:18:07,288 --> 00:18:11,579
that night in Louisville Kentucky we'd

345
00:18:09,779 --> 00:18:13,319
always heard that Rudolf diesel with

346
00:18:11,579 --> 00:18:15,089
manufactured his diesel engine run off

347
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:17,700
seed oil we really didn't understand

348
00:18:15,089 --> 00:18:21,599
quite grasp that this was in the early

349
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:24,000
90s late 80s and then the fella from

350
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:26,250
Nevada Las Vegas Nevada came through

351
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,589
town driving a little Volkswagen diesel

352
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:32,369
and he's running adult Burger King oil

353
00:18:28,589 --> 00:18:34,798
and so we had just derived some hip or a

354
00:18:32,369 --> 00:18:36,750
lot of hemp seeds hemp seeds are thirty

355
00:18:34,798 --> 00:18:38,788
to forty percent oil by weight you got

356
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:41,130
to underground temp seeds you can drive

357
00:18:38,788 --> 00:18:43,950
30 to 40 pounds of pure oil out of it

358
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:46,049
and so we had some of that and he tested

359
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:47,700
to the doubt in his engine and he says

360
00:18:46,048 --> 00:18:51,269
this is the best seed or that I've ever

361
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:53,430
driven this car on and so we had seed or

362
00:18:51,269 --> 00:18:55,829
when Willie came in to do it

363
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:58,170
fit concert for me we poured that in

364
00:18:55,829 --> 00:19:01,019
foil into my Mercedes diesel and drove

365
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:03,660
at about 110 miles across Kentucky and

366
00:19:01,019 --> 00:19:05,490
it was the first time in I guess 50 to

367
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:07,650
60 years that didn't vehicle there have

368
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:10,319
been driven on it boil on the United

369
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:13,230
States roads but Willie told me later on

370
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:15,929
the 12 years later actually no I mean

371
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:18,569
about ten years later he says gate woods

372
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:20,070
he says that afternoon we did that as it

373
00:19:18,569 --> 00:19:22,230
taught me what it was all about and

374
00:19:20,069 --> 00:19:24,119
that's the reason I started my bio fuel

375
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:25,950
company was from what we learned that

376
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:28,289
afternoon driving your Mercedes across

377
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:30,269
there and we also spoken about the

378
00:19:28,289 --> 00:19:31,920
biggest Hooters probably road in

379
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:35,369
Kentucky at the time and there was a

380
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:37,980
caravan of us we went from the hyatt

381
00:19:35,369 --> 00:19:41,519
there and rough auditorium through

382
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:44,670
Frankfurt the state capital is about 80

383
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:47,240
miles and then altogether 120 miles all

384
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:49,920
the way into Louisville which is largest

385
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:52,289
city in Kentucky and then he did a big

386
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:55,410
benefit concert for you there that night

387
00:19:52,289 --> 00:19:57,750
that's right you know we need we need

388
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:59,250
help in health care of camp as a cash

389
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:01,259
crop out there for the petroleum

390
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:02,940
purposes now you get twenty two barrels

391
00:20:01,259 --> 00:20:04,559
of petroleum off an acre of hemp when

392
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:06,960
you grow cannabis in an industrial

393
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:08,339
textile direction our farmers need that

394
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,779
niche in the energy market and that

395
00:20:08,339 --> 00:20:11,639
would furnish according to state

396
00:20:09,779 --> 00:20:15,509
calculations sixty-eight thousand new

397
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:19,950
jobs for seed hemp is planted in hills

398
00:20:15,509 --> 00:20:22,289
like corn sometimes by hand empezar

399
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:24,690
dioecious plant the female flower is

400
00:20:22,289 --> 00:20:27,299
inconspicuous but the male flower is

401
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:29,460
easily spotted in seed production after

402
00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:33,690
the pollen has been shed these male

403
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:36,680
plants are cut out these are the seeds

404
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:36,680
on a female plant

405
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:42,769
tempra fiber is ready to harvest when

406
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:45,620
the pollen is shedding and the leaves

407
00:20:42,769 --> 00:20:48,200
are falling in Kentucky hemp harvest

408
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:50,269
comes in August here the old standby has

409
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:53,440
been the self r a creeper which has been

410
00:20:50,269 --> 00:20:53,440
used for a generation or more

411
00:20:55,210 --> 00:21:00,620
hemp grosso luxuriantly in Kentucky that

412
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,240
harvesting is sometimes difficult which

413
00:21:00,619 --> 00:21:07,839
may account for the popularity of the

414
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:10,460
self rake with its lateral stroke in

415
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:12,470
Kentucky hemp is shocked as soon as safe

416
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:15,640
after cutting to be spread out for

417
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:15,640
reffing later in the fall

418
00:21:30,128 --> 00:21:33,368
my god

419
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:55,460
walk out

420
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:26,009
just so heartening to see the the

421
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:29,279
progress that you know of course

422
00:22:26,009 --> 00:22:31,470
proposition 215 in California 96 and

423
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:36,470
what you folks have done here in Oregon

424
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:39,089
I mean it's just it's just fuel my fire

425
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:40,769
to see you all actually succeed it's

426
00:22:39,089 --> 00:22:43,980
something I've been trying to do in

427
00:22:40,769 --> 00:22:45,720
Kentucky for many field for 40 years we

428
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:47,220
need to lift Kentucky out of poverty is

429
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:50,640
one of the most poverty-ridden states in

430
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:52,799
the country we find 47 48 49 and 50th

431
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,770
and all the standard living in Texas our

432
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:57,569
children are poor we're broke bankrupt

433
00:22:54,769 --> 00:23:00,180
we can't fund the retirement for our

434
00:22:57,569 --> 00:23:03,329
teachers or public employees that we

435
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:04,950
need to find rediscover something that

436
00:23:03,329 --> 00:23:06,539
will generate some money in state of

437
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:08,610
course we were the world's largest

438
00:23:06,539 --> 00:23:11,519
producer of cannabis for over 100 years

439
00:23:08,609 --> 00:23:13,500
and so you know I want to go back and

440
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:15,869
touch on the history and heritage of the

441
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:18,000
state and get us to return to cannabis

442
00:23:15,869 --> 00:23:20,579
as a cash crop hey we're the first a

443
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,890
decent Mississippi to actually license

444
00:23:20,579 --> 00:23:24,509
and regulate the hell out of it we will

445
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:26,490
live Kentucky out of poverty I'll fill

446
00:23:24,509 --> 00:23:28,470
every hotel room and motel room at state

447
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:30,509
seven nights a week Saracen boom walnut

448
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:32,309
these won't be people come in there and

449
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:33,720
drink whiskey and punch holes in your

450
00:23:32,309 --> 00:23:37,740
walls these people come in and sit down

451
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:40,019
row 1 and order room service the United

452
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:41,759
States Constitution does not provide you

453
00:23:40,019 --> 00:23:43,650
the right to life liberty and pursuit of

454
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:45,000
happiness that's in Independence

455
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:48,450
Declaration of Independence that's not

456
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:52,440
law so you don't officially have a right

457
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:54,360
to that under federal law but Kentucky

458
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:57,090
has a constitutional so just like all

459
00:23:54,359 --> 00:23:59,059
the other states do but just so happens

460
00:23:57,089 --> 00:24:02,209
that Kentucky's Constitution is the most

461
00:23:59,059 --> 00:24:05,309
pro-people Constitution ever written

462
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:07,019
that I our people back in night 1890 got

463
00:24:05,309 --> 00:24:08,369
so tired of being raped by the railroad

464
00:24:07,019 --> 00:24:11,250
companies that they wrote a constitution

465
00:24:08,369 --> 00:24:12,869
that protected the people and kept

466
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:15,900
corporations from being running

467
00:24:12,869 --> 00:24:17,459
roughshod over everybody and even now

468
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:19,860
that's beginning to fracture as our

469
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:22,829
legislature keeps selling out to it to

470
00:24:19,859 --> 00:24:23,779
the earth to the folks that i call the

471
00:24:22,829 --> 00:24:25,889
petrochemical pharmaceutical

472
00:24:23,779 --> 00:24:27,329
military-industrial transnational

473
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:29,720
corporate fascist to meet some of a

474
00:24:27,329 --> 00:24:29,720
[ __ ]

475
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:40,419
so what's going to happen is that the

476
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:43,710
very first section of Kentucky's

477
00:24:40,419 --> 00:24:48,160
Constitution ensures that its citizens

478
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:50,169
constitutionally are endowed with the

479
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:53,410
right to life liberty and the pursuit of

480
00:24:50,169 --> 00:24:55,720
happiness as the number one section in

481
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:58,298
Kentucky Constitution so I feel obliged

482
00:24:55,720 --> 00:25:00,640
to make it the number one basis the

483
00:24:58,298 --> 00:25:03,160
policy for my relationship of government

484
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:05,950
to the people in state of Kentucky I'm

485
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:07,660
going to get it off of their bikes I'm

486
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:09,250
going to take it out of the bedrooms and

487
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:11,290
the blood streams and then brains and

488
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:12,759
bladders the bill folks in fact pockets

489
00:25:11,289 --> 00:25:14,168
the internet bulletin boards have put

490
00:25:12,759 --> 00:25:18,429
them back in the little box where they

491
00:25:14,169 --> 00:25:21,580
belong I'm going to make government not

492
00:25:18,429 --> 00:25:23,590
a burden on the people i think it's the

493
00:25:21,579 --> 00:25:27,308
role of government to uplift enlighten

494
00:25:23,589 --> 00:25:29,259
educate and endow people with an

495

a lot of traffic on those going to our

516

518
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:28,650

with the light changes you turn around

525
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:43,620

538
00:27:55,609 --> 00:27:59,628
independent candidate for governor we

539
00:27:57,319 --> 00:28:01,788
don't want a political party my running

541

542
00:28:03,499 --> 00:28:06,909
other children over on the playground

543
00:28:07,118 --> 00:28:11,509
we're trying to get some serious

544
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:16,340
conversation going on here okay so you

545
00:28:11,509 --> 00:28:17,389
go with the other kids over there you

546
00:28:16,339 --> 00:28:18,618
know people say galvers you're a

547
00:28:17,388 --> 00:28:21,199
perennial candidate that's what

548
00:28:18,618 --> 00:28:22,759
kentucky's got perennial problems if the

549
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,590
people would beat me the first time and

550
00:28:22,759 --> 00:28:27,829
solve the problems I wouldn't I had to

551
00:28:24,589 --> 00:28:30,408
run again but they didn't and they have

552
00:28:27,829 --> 00:28:31,849
it and they can't because neither party

553
00:28:30,409 --> 00:28:33,860
can produce a candidate that can

554
00:28:31,849 --> 00:28:35,298
disengage from the partisanship long

555
00:28:33,859 --> 00:28:40,189
left work with the other side to

556
00:28:35,298 --> 00:28:42,288
actually get the job done the leadership

557
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:44,629
of both parties had their horns locked

558
00:28:42,288 --> 00:28:46,638
up like to whitetail buck fighting over

559
00:28:44,628 --> 00:28:50,359
territory while our business lays dead

560
00:28:46,638 --> 00:28:51,918
in the gust and and both of the parties

561
00:28:50,359 --> 00:28:53,599
are the blame for what we've got here

562
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:57,019
neither party has presented any

563
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:59,058
solutions to it dee and I are not asking

564
00:28:57,019 --> 00:29:01,669
you to vote against your party or vote

565
00:28:59,058 --> 00:29:03,528
for the other dreaded party we're asking

566
00:29:01,669 --> 00:29:05,659
you to vote for an independent governor

567
00:29:03,528 --> 00:29:07,819
who does not care who gets credit for

568
00:29:05,659 --> 00:29:09,619
doing what's right for the people if

569
00:29:07,819 --> 00:29:11,388
you're a democrat or republican or an

570
00:29:09,618 --> 00:29:13,339
independent if you've got a solution to

571
00:29:11,388 --> 00:29:14,839
Kentucky's problems you can come to

572
00:29:13,339 --> 00:29:16,849
Kentucky their governor's office where

573
00:29:14,839 --> 00:29:19,428
we stand and we will do our best and we

574
00:29:16,849 --> 00:29:20,808
will give you all the credit for it and

575
00:29:19,429 --> 00:29:22,580
you come up with a good idea mr.

576
00:29:20,808 --> 00:29:24,678
Williams had a great idea the other day

577
00:29:22,579 --> 00:29:26,778
and I complimented him on it and I said

578
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:28,009
David I said when I'm governor and

579
00:29:26,778 --> 00:29:32,569
you're President and Senate we're going

580
00:29:28,009 --> 00:29:35,089
to put that idea true but you know folks

581
00:29:32,569 --> 00:29:37,548
I got to tell you mr. Williams can't win

582
00:29:35,089 --> 00:29:38,579
this election mr. Wynn's cannot win this

583
00:29:37,548 --> 00:29:43,038
election

584
00:29:38,579 --> 00:29:46,558
I'm sorry to say I'm start saying well

585
00:29:43,038 --> 00:29:48,269
ma'am listen isn't one for an extremely

586
00:29:46,558 --> 00:29:50,668
good mama and if ready daddy bill

587
00:29:48,269 --> 00:29:53,130
maximum security prison I got wrong a

588
00:29:50,669 --> 00:29:54,899
really long time ago so my mom is

589
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:58,980
probably kept me on straight narrow more

590
00:29:54,898 --> 00:30:01,739
than ideal but uh when I uh as i got

591
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:10,169
older i became desperate for role models

592
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:17,370
and so I looked for the people glob dogs

593
00:30:10,169 --> 00:30:21,090
just the right things there are five so

594
00:30:17,369 --> 00:30:23,099
I decided quite frankly be one of you I

595
00:30:21,089 --> 00:30:24,480
decide to just decide you need the new

596
00:30:23,099 --> 00:30:27,589
hero and there's a reason for why

597
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,589
shouldn't be it right

598
00:32:16,079 --> 00:32:23,649
gatewood supported our initiative drive

599
00:32:19,779 --> 00:32:25,808
did so very publicly he be very happy to

600
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:28,870
see the turn of events since then but he

601
00:32:25,808 --> 00:32:31,569
was an amazing speaker and one of my

602
00:32:28,869 --> 00:32:35,649
mentors yeah your friends course we

603
00:32:31,569 --> 00:32:38,319
don't like it just hush up about we

604
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:40,240
watched him run nine races in 29 years

605
00:32:38,319 --> 00:32:42,189
and every time this is the most

606
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:44,769
efficient vote bidding process in the

607
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:46,900
world it was classic Gatewood I knew

608
00:32:44,769 --> 00:32:48,879
there if they have he ran for Congress

609
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:52,900
back to back in two thousand get a

610
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:55,210
photographer in two thousand two argued

611
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:58,480
he said he was done after the 2002

612
00:32:55,210 --> 00:33:00,700
election but there he was the next year

613
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:03,308
running for attorney general literally I

614
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:05,830
was drafted into this race Gateway was a

615
00:33:03,308 --> 00:33:08,109
sound byte machine thank you brother

616
00:33:05,829 --> 00:33:10,240
percentage of brands out there I'll

617
00:33:08,109 --> 00:33:13,058
never forget that early May Day I spent

618
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:14,529
with him in 2007 while he was running in

619
00:33:13,058 --> 00:33:16,990
the Democratic primary for governor

620
00:33:14,529 --> 00:33:19,658
thank you dear i love you all to a

621

624
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:27,630
we cannot have it

625
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:31,470
the partisanship is killing me engaging

626
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:36,960
and intelligent but also right here just

627
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:39,360
lucky enough to never be taken seriously

628
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:41,400
by the mainstream this was the time he

629
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:44,299
was arrested during Lexington's fourth

630
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:44,300
of July parade

631
00:33:44,329 --> 00:33:49,339
yes he was an independent cuss the gate

632
00:33:47,569 --> 00:33:53,859
wooden hours because they're down this

633
00:33:49,339 --> 00:33:53,859
