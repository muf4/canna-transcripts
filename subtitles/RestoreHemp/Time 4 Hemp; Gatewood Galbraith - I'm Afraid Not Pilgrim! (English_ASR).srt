1
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:06,318
you know the other day I was on a TV

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:08,119
program when a moderator come on came on

3
00:00:06,318 --> 00:00:09,519
he looked into the camera and said while

4
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:12,039
other candidates for Governor are

5
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:14,080
running on better schools and more roads

6
00:00:12,039 --> 00:00:16,000
Gatewood Galer is running on legalizing

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,920
marijuana and I said hold it right there

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,278
Bob let's get something straight just

9
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:24,080
like these other candidates I Envision

10
00:00:21,278 --> 00:00:26,320
better schools and I Envision more roads

11
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:28,439
and I did Envision delivery of healthc

12
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,518
care to the rural areas and feeding our

13
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:32,039
hungry and housing our homeless the only

14
00:00:30,518 --> 00:00:34,238
difference between me and these other

15
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:36,359
candidates is that I figured out a way

16
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:39,519
to pay for it without putting it on the

17
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:39,519
shoulders of the already

18
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:52,000
over first day in office I'm going to

19
00:00:50,238 --> 00:00:54,839

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,840
Kentucky owns they're not

Gardens of the people the state Kentucky

24
00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:04,558

26
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:16,399

[Applause]

28
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:23,000
are it is obsene that we have 66 out of

29
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:25,040
kuy's 120 counties that can't even

30
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,680
afford to educate their own children and

31
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,400

34
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:34,199
of dollars in taxfree income to the

35
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:36,519
international criminal syndicates in

36
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,159

40
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:44,478
