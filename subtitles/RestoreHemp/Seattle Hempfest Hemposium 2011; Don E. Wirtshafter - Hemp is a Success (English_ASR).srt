1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:06,798

6
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:20,839
the hemp industry you know and

7
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:22,719
um we're approaching our 25e pins in the

8
00:00:20,839 --> 00:00:27,118
hemp industry

9
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:30,439
and and I I stay um uh current on

10
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:31,359
cannabis issues and I'm helping cannabis

11
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:34,600
um

12
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:37,200
providers um in a general sense in in

13
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:40,879
the modern era and and the edges that

14
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,440
those um cannabis providers um do what

15
00:00:40,878 --> 00:00:44,718
else I'm doing I'm helping the people

16
00:00:42,439 --> 00:00:48,519
that are playing with the synthetic

17
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:52,520
cannaboids uh here in the industry but

18
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:56,359
um to me the Hempfest is a real

19
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:59,160
indicator of where we are and and how

20
00:00:56,359 --> 00:01:02,519
incredible Hempfest has become the the

21
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:07,039
organization here the the the people the

22
00:01:02,518 --> 00:01:09,640
the the Core5 bucks you you just gave 35

23
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:12,280
bucks right on can anybody match that 35

24
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:16,040
bucks somebody come on somebody matches

25
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:19,040
35 bucks right there you know

26
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:19,040
and

27
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:27,478
cigarett right Hempfest has been um um

28
00:01:24,519 --> 00:01:29,560
it it is a success because hemp is a

29
00:01:27,478 --> 00:01:32,920
success and whether you know it or not

30
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:36,879
just like the East Coast can't see that

31
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:39,599
cannabis is no big deal out west um the

32
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:41,920
America can't see that hemp is no big

33
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:43,839
deal anywhere else in the rest of the

34
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:47,079
world and it's actually becoming a big

35
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:49,719
deal because it's becoming Big Industry

36
00:01:47,078 --> 00:01:52,239
um especially in Canada and and now

37
00:01:49,718 --> 00:01:55,879
there's more than 10,000 people directly

38
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:58,560
employed producing hemp products and the

39
00:01:55,879 --> 00:02:00,879
plans the the the momentum there is

40
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,640
humongous and it's not not just hemp

41
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:04,679
Foods it started off with hemp foods

42
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:08,719
that was the first thing that made

43
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:12,200
sense and now it's building materials

44
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:13,479
and that's going to make the thing go

45
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:16,479
huge

46
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:19,000
because the quantities of hemp that are

47
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:22,919
needed to make building materials are

48
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,400
Farm size you know County size um

49
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:28,759
growing of industrial hemp it's going to

50
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:31,879
become a commodity that will be traded

51
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:34,560
in carloads on the Futures Market in our

52
00:02:31,878 --> 00:02:36,479
lifetimes rather than in back alleys and

53
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,598
uh otherwise so I think it's a it's a

54
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:39,598
great positive ship
