14
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:41,799
that's going on here in Washington

15
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:45,079

17
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:51,239
ridiculous the drug war gets while you

19
00:00:51,238 --> 00:00:57,599
that our energy passed an initiative

20
00:00:54,920 --> 00:01:00,679

21
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:04,159

Washington the rest of America suffers

23
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,960

32
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:37,879

33
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:40,758

00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:52,759
okay so we got a normal couple in

37
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:56,478
Washington the woman is really sick she

38
00:01:52,759 --> 00:02:00,599
had Polio as a child has you know blown

39
00:01:56,478 --> 00:02:03,599
up from that 400 lb gets surgery surgery

40
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:06,000
goes bad and she spends a month on the

41
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:07,559
operating table just to save her life

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,038
they had her in a coma for a month just

43
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:13,920
to save her she has no stomach anymore

44
00:02:10,038 --> 00:02:16,279
from this right she's on a crazy diet

45
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:18,799
where she has to eat papaya all day long

46
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:20,878
to stay alive they're up there by the

47
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,360
Canadian border in the middle of nowhere

48
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:25,318
how do you get papaya they build a

49
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,480
greenhouse and filled the greenhouse

50
00:02:25,318 --> 00:02:31,359
with Papaya plants and 2 years later

51
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:32,719
they got their sust and papayas coming

52
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:37,319
out of their

53
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:40,479
greenhouse and the DEA gets gets wind of

54
00:02:37,318 --> 00:02:43,479
them of their sun growing pot in an

55
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:45,439
adjoining place and the DEA comes up in

56
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:46,119
the middle of the night with boats up

57
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:51,280
the

58
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:54,039
river sneaks on their farm with ninjas

59
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,439
guys in black black hoods I mean this is

60
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:58,239
how people get killed around here and

61
00:02:56,439 --> 00:03:00,039
they sneak on the farm trying to find

62
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,840
the marijuana and can't find it but oh

63
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:03,519
there's a

64
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:05,280
greenhouse okay so they come back the

65
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:08,239
next day and they do that was what they

66
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:11,120
call a sneaking Peak okay and now their

67
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,560
technique was to do a knock and talk you

68
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,519
know where they come up and knock on

69
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,920
your front door oh hi we're just looking

70
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:18,920
for somebody and they look around and

71
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:22,000
whatever so they do the knock and talk

72
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:24,518
and they say we could smell marijuana

73
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,158
now these are licensed Washington

74
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:30,280
patients and that's not easy to be right

75
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:32,280
these are licensed Washington patience

76
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:35,158
but this is our federal government at

77
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:37,318
work so they go to the judge they don't

78
00:03:35,158 --> 00:03:39,639
say anything to the judge about hey we

79
00:03:37,318 --> 00:03:42,158
smelled marijuana at a licensed

80
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:44,399
Washington patients house they say we

81
00:03:42,158 --> 00:03:46,039
smelled marijuana and that was their

82
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,599
probable cause to come in with

83
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:52,239
helicopters and 14 agencies 10 and some

84
00:03:49,598 --> 00:03:54,598
officers to arrest this couple and their

85
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:57,878
31 plants that they were illegally

86
00:03:54,598 --> 00:04:01,078
growing under Washington

87
00:03:57,878 --> 00:04:03,639
law but that's that the tragic part the

88
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:05,599
tra the de comes in the greenhouse all

89
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:08,958
expecting to see a room full of

90
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:12,000
marijuana and find a room full of

91
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:13,680
papayas and what does the DEA do with

92
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,600
that room full of

93
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:20,239
papayas what they're taught to do

94
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:22,280
machete them down and carry them away so

95
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:24,879
all this work to keep this woman alive

96
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:27,198
is wasted by these guys tearing down

97
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:30,399
these papayas that take two years to

98
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:32,840
produce you know and and so this has

99
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:35,879
gotten really crazy this case the

100
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:37,239
husband went to court federal court had

101
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:40,478
a jury

102
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:42,038
trial where this is all going on but

103
00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:44,079
because of the way the federal

104
00:04:42,038 --> 00:04:45,240
government is schizophrenic about

105
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:48,038
medical

106
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:51,160
marijuana the judge orders that he can't

107
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:53,800
say anything about medical marijuana in

108
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:57,160
the trial and he says but wait a minute

109
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:58,720
it wasn't mine it was my wife's and and

110
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:01,240
and she's not being charged of course

111
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,080
she's so sick they can't charge her if

112
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,879
they if the jury saw how sick she was

113
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:08,240
they would let her go she got ordered to

114
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:09,839
come to court without her wheelchair CU

115
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,478
she wasn't allowed to look sick in front

116
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:14,198
of the jury we couldn't mention medical

117
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:16,918
they couldn't mention the fact that on

118
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:19,038
the wall of the Grove is all her medical

119
00:05:16,918 --> 00:05:20,038
