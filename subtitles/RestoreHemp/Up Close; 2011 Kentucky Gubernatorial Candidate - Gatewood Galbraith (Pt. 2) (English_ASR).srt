1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:05,200
I tell you a couple of plans that I I

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,399
have for the state of Kentucky uh I

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,240
would appreciate if I get that

4
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:10,160
opportunity I'm setting up here with a

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:15,400
couple of uh a couple of movers and

6
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:17,879
shakers in the uh in the the prospect of

7
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:20,960
medical marijuana and marijuana people I

8
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:22,679
said early on that I wanted to uh make

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,160
marijuana legal but I I don't want to

10
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:26,678
make marijuana legal cuz 8-year-olds can

11
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:29,000
stand on the street corner and eat a de

12
00:00:26,678 --> 00:00:30,759
made and that's legal I don't want that

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,238
I want some sort of people ought to be

14
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:34,759
able to grow their own and be regulated

15
00:00:33,238 --> 00:00:36,839
by families if there's any problem with

16
00:00:34,759 --> 00:00:40,199
it bringing Social Services instead of

17
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,680
the cops uh you know if uh and only that

18
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:45,559
under probable

19
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:47,359
cause uh but uh if it's going to be

20
00:00:45,558 --> 00:00:50,359
Commerce in it the government has right

21
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:51,840
to license and or tax they just have

22
00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:54,039
that right I mean that's

23
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,280
Commerce they do the same thing with

24
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:57,840
widgets so you know but I want that

25
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,000
money I don't want it going over to the

26
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,359
corporations I don't want Friday nights

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,159
sales I don't want golden arches I don't

28
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:07,359
want clearance sales I don't want any

29
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:10,118
advertising encouraging its use that's

30
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:11,560
not what we're out here for you know at

31
00:01:10,118 --> 00:01:13,040
the same time I'd like to see the money

32
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:15,280
that's generate back go back to the

33
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,640
dealers that people were dealing now

34
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,079
there're some of the best minds of this

35
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,640
generation they're running a billion

36
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:22,400
dollar Business Without a shred of

37
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:24,000
paperwork you know I think they ought to

38
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,118
I think it ought to stay in the hands as

39
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,118
people are putting it out now but uh I'm

40
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:31,640
also going to uh put it in the hands of

41
00:01:30,118 --> 00:01:34,399
all the sick and dying

42
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:36,079
Kian I want to take it out of the hands

43
00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:38,680
of the teenagers and put it over to the

44
00:01:36,078 --> 00:01:40,519
hands of the people in the old age homes

45
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,920
I mean it would put a smile on their

46
00:01:40,519 --> 00:01:43,438
face it would increase their appetite

47
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,599
and think about the increased visitation

48
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:50,718
by the Young Folks hey let's go see Dad

49
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:52,478
you know the uh uh want to uh I want to

50
00:01:50,718 --> 00:01:54,839
educate the people the kids of the state

51
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:57,000
of Kentucky and I have plans for doing

52
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:00,280
that

53
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,959
um I'm out here uh to see if I can raise

54
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:04,159
any

55
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:06,919
money it uh I am a criminal defense

56
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:09,640
attorney I can also for

57
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:11,560
hire uh any lottery winners out there

58
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:14,518
who need a little

59
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:16,920
consultation um there is no limit there

60
00:02:14,519 --> 00:02:19,360
is a limit on $1,000 contribution in my

61
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:22,958
race for governor but there is no limit

62
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:25,000
on a govern on on an attorney's fee so

63
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:27,560
um anybody who needs any special

64
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,800
consultation I'm the man to do it

65
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:32,319
with um money is probably going to be

66
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,599
the biggest issue in this race we we

67
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:37,039
probably need to raise about a half

68
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:38,959
million bucks we're at 140,000 right now

69
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:42,679
as our numbers begin to climb I think

70
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:45,239
the money will start to come in but um

71
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:51,080
this early money is the most important

72
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:53,920
so um I've got envelopes down here um

73
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:55,400
that if you want to make a contribution

74
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:57,119
you can take this envelope and fill it

75
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,039

with me this evening this is my

89
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:32,680
autobiography

90
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:34,798
it's called the last free man in America

91
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:39,840
meets the synthetic

92
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:42,560
subversion it is the story of uh 40

93
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:45,000
years of work on my behalf to try to

94
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:47,280
find out just what went wrong with

95
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,120
America what what went wrong with the

96
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,158
with the concept of individual

97
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,120
sovereignty and the name of the book is

98
00:03:51,158 --> 00:03:54,719
the last free man in America meets the

99
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,560
synthetic

100
00:03:54,719 --> 00:04:00,280
subversion and that's what went

101
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:02,319
wrong that uh that we were agrarian

102
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,239
society we produced it all from the land

103
00:04:02,318 --> 00:04:07,199
we discovered the plant that was the

104
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:09,878
answer to all our most basic needs fi

105
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:12,199
fuel medicine and food and then they

106
00:04:09,878 --> 00:04:14,120
discovered petroleum and they discovered

107
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:17,399
all the synthetic processes that could

108
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:19,478
be done to extract products from

109
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:22,319
petroleum and they decided to take the

110
00:04:19,478 --> 00:04:24,039
farmer out of competition with them not

111
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:26,839
only in the petrochemical but the

112
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:29,439
pharmaceutical and medicinal

113
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:32,000
aspect and so now a great number of our

114
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:33,560
problem s dealt with because both the

115
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,399
major parties that were set up to

116
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:38,319
protect us both on a national and local

117
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:40,839
level have been bought off with the

118
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:43,319
special interest money extraordinary

119
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:45,159
special interest money from the people

120
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:46,959
that I call the petrochemical

121
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:49,080
pharmaceutical military industrial

122
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:50,359
transnational corporate fascist Elite

123
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:52,918
son of a

124
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:54,319
it's got a to it the ones who

125
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:55,879
have never said the pledge of allegiance

126
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:58,199
to the flag the United States of America

127
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:59,759
or to the Republic for which it stands

128
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:01,478
and the ones who view the Constitution

129
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,199
and the Bill of Rights as impediments to

130
00:05:01,478 --> 00:05:05,319
the implementation of a new world order

131
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:07,720
and global

132
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:09,279
economy and that's just where it's at

133
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,560
these people have bought off the people

134
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:11,839
were supposed to be protecting us

135
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,120
they're trying to dismantle the

136
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:17,758
Constitution and our rights just as fast

137
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:19,439
as they can well they ran into a hard

138
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,400
Road hole in the state of Kentucky if I

139
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:22,560
get to be

140
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:24,799
Governor that I recognize them for who

141
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,918
they are them

142
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:30,918
guys and I ain't going to let them guys

143
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:36,359
take over and make a mo out of the

144
00:05:30,918 --> 00:05:38,439
sacrifices of all the dads and grandads

145
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,720
who hit the beaches at Nority and Evo

146
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:43,478
gima so that you wouldn't have to pee in

147
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:46,479
the cup to hold the job in

148
00:05:43,478 --> 00:05:48,360
America so we're going to ReDiscover

149
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:50,359
whether the people in fact those people

150
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:53,080
died in

151
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:54,560
vain every generation must rewin its own

152
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:56,240
freedoms that's what it says here in

153
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,000
this little Cloud on the front of the

154
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:01,319
book you know all the sacrifices that

155
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,160
anybody in in the past up until the last

156
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:06,199
second of my talking to you don't count

157
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,919
anymore is what you're willing to do

158
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:09,079
from this second forward it's going to

159
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:11,399
decide whether we still have any

160
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:13,598
freedoms to

161
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:15,159
America the reason I became a champion

162
00:06:13,598 --> 00:06:16,800
of marijuana is because and I was

163
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:21,120
asthmatic all my

164
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:25,038
life and uh I was uh in out the hospital

165
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:26,918
on many occasions I was 4f for the Army

166
00:06:25,038 --> 00:06:29,598
I made the Marines take me by getting a

167
00:06:26,918 --> 00:06:32,120
couple of doctors to say I'd outgrown it

168
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:34,240
I was on Paris Island for 6 weeks and

169
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:36,598
somebody pit some dust in my face and I

170
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:39,199
went into a asthmatic attack I was

171
00:06:36,598 --> 00:06:41,240
discharged Paris Island the Marines I

172
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,160
was 19 years old I didn't know marijuana

173
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,160
cured

174
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,919
asthma friend of mine came back from

175
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,759
Bangkok Thailand with some TI weed and

176
00:06:46,918 --> 00:06:50,318
said gate would try this and I said

177
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:53,000
isn't that dangerous and he says it'll

178
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:55,080
help you he later became a doctor so I

179
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,199
trusted him I smoke where I wanted the

180
00:06:55,079 --> 00:07:00,598
first time just like that it cured my

181
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:02,879
asthma just like

182
00:07:00,598 --> 00:07:05,959
that for someone who's gone through a

183
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:08,400
lifetime of 21 years being totally

184
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:09,878
afraid that at any moment their lungs

185
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:11,519
are going to close up on them let me

186
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:13,439
tell you that creates a lot of free

187
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:16,639
floating

188
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:21,120
anxiety and uh you know a lot of

189
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:24,680
fear marijuana cured it just like

190
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:26,240
that because I tell you what marijuana

191
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:28,959
is a gateway

192
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:31,120
drug marijuana is the gateway to

193
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:33,478
existential

194
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,598
ISM when you discover it there's more

195
00:07:33,478 --> 00:07:38,478
than one

196
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:40,800
reality when you discover that it is no

197
00:07:38,478 --> 00:07:43,800
just one way of looking at things there

198
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,800
are things called

199
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:48,079
perspectives when you discover that you

200
00:07:46,038 --> 00:07:50,598
have the widest range of choices you

201
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:51,719
ever imagined you have because you now

202
00:07:50,598 --> 00:07:54,199
understand there's a second way of

203
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,199
looking at

204
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:58,719
everything you just doubled or tripled

205
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:01,240
or quadrupled the way you can look at

206
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,639
things

207
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,319
it's damned entertaining trying to

208
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,079
figure out which one has anything to do

209
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,598
with

210
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:11,279
reality that's what makes it such a a

211
00:08:08,598 --> 00:08:13,759
wonderful thing it just Alters your

212
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:15,519
perspective so just getting up and uh

213
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:19,400
going looking out the window getting off

214
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:19,399
couch so does thinking
