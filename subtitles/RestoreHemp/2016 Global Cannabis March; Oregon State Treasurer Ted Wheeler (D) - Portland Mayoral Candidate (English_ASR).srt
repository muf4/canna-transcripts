regulated tax cannabis industry and as

00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:40,829
long as I am the treasurer for the state

16
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:44,190

20
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,109
of the voters in this community I think

21
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:56,969
there's a great amount of energy here

22
00:00:55,109 --> 00:00:59,549
today this is a pivotal time for our

23
00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:01,649
country for our state for our city but

24
00:00:59,549 --> 00:01:04,920
folks let's be honest there's a lot more

25
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:06,478
that we need to do I've heard from so

26
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,299
many of the entrepreneurs about the

27
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:11,728
importance of making sure that Portland

28
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:14,700
remember obtains its place as a

29
00:01:11,728 --> 00:01:17,280
respectful and open community to the

30
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:19,740
industry if we do that what's going to

31
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,989
happen is people are going to want to

32
00:01:19,739 --> 00:01:24,449
open businesses here they will want to

33
00:01:21,989 --> 00:01:27,688
employ people here and that can only be

34
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:31,140
a good thing for our economy let's also

35
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:33,569
understand that under measure 91 there

36
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:37,759
were rights that are ascribed to medical

37
00:01:33,569 --> 00:01:41,578
marijuana patients they deserve a safe

38
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:44,519
respectful indoor location to consume

39
00:01:41,578 --> 00:01:47,389
that was the intention of measure 91 and

40
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:50,368
we should work hard to uphold that

41
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:52,680
intention we also need to acknowledge

42
00:01:50,368 --> 00:01:56,069
that the entrepreneurs that were here

43
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:59,490
today only a year ago they were

44
00:01:56,069 --> 00:02:01,919
criminals and they were treated as such

45
00:01:59,489 --> 00:02:04,589
under Oregon law and we have to

46
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:07,349
acknowledge that there is a path here to

47
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:09,060
help make sure that fresh start Oregon

48
00:02:07,349 --> 00:02:12,060
which was created with the legislature

49
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,500
and other efforts including expunging

50
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:15,780
over

51
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:18,479
thousands of Records criminal records

52
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:20,550
that were nonviolent in 2015 is help

53
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:23,219
getting people back to where we need to

54
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:24,870
be as a strong community at the end of

55
00:02:23,219 --> 00:02:26,789
the day here's what we've got to do

56
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:30,780
we've got to acknowledge the cannabis

57
00:02:26,789 --> 00:02:34,829
industry for what it is it is legal it

58
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:37,140
is regulated it is taxed and it's a

59
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:39,510
tremendous opportunity to uplift our

60
00:02:37,139 --> 00:02:42,750
community help get people employed

61
00:02:39,509 --> 00:02:44,579
reduce income in income disparity which

62
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:47,009
we all know is growing across our nation

63
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:49,560
or state in our community and it can be

64
00:02:47,009 --> 00:02:51,780
a great boon to our community done right

65
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:55,129
and done well and as your mayor I'm

66
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:55,129
pledging to do that
