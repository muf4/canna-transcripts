1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:04,560
I think we're on the verge of some very

2
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:06,119
exciting

3
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:10,199
changes

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:12,638
and people's awareness is growing

5
00:00:10,199 --> 00:00:16,000
steadily in

6
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:19,079
order uh to have hemp agriculture in the

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,559
United States we've been in working on a

8
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:24,439
number of projects so that we can hit

9
00:00:21,559 --> 00:00:27,719
the ground running when we have hemp

10
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:30,599
agriculture in the United States we're

11
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:34,399
working on developing processes and

12
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:37,000
products so that we are ready to have

13
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:39,000
hemp agriculture in the United States

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,519
we're working with materials that were

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,840
grown in Canada and we're using these to

16
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:48,280
develop these processes because we do

17
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:51,000
not want to hold our breath waiting for

18
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:54,320
somebody to change a

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,519
law you can't bet on an uncertainty but

20
00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:00,238
there are certain parts of it that are

21
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:03,320
quite certain I can get hemp fiber

22
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:06,438
organically grown in Canada I can get

23
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:10,759
hemp herds by the

24
00:01:06,438 --> 00:01:12,279
bail we can TR we can transport them

25
00:01:10,759 --> 00:01:15,000
without

26
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:16,560
restriction to our research centers here

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,200
in the United

28
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:22,200
States these are all materials that are

29
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:26,000
certified noncontroversial

30
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:28,879
I've been talking with a number of

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,519
agricultural research stations who are

32
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:34,519
very interested

33
00:01:30,519 --> 00:01:38,118
in working with the hemp pressing oil

34
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:40,798
doing the same processes and analyses to

35
00:01:38,118 --> 00:01:43,239
analyze hemp seed oil to compare them

36
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,079
with the canola oil and the sunflower

37
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:47,759
oil and the soybean oil that are being

38
00:01:45,078 --> 00:01:51,078
used to make biodiesel turns out that

39
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:53,879
hemp seed oil with all those double

40
00:01:51,078 --> 00:01:56,118
Bonds in it stays liquid at lower

41
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:59,118
temperatures one of the problems of

42
00:01:56,118 --> 00:02:00,759
biodiesel is that it tends to gel in

43
00:01:59,118 --> 00:02:03,599
cooler weather

44
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:06,280
so hemp seed oil biodiesel is more

45
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:11,280
resistant to jelling in cold

46
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:14,280
weather with all those all those uh efas

47
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:17,919
all those polyunsaturated fats they stay

48
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:20,400
liquid even at freezer temperatures take

49
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:22,280
a bottle of hemp seed oil when you get

50
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,640
it at the store don't put it in the

51
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:28,000
refrigerator put it in the freezer and

52
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:31,000
watch it still stays pourable what other

53
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:35,919
oil would do that this is

54
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:41,280
fantastic we're looking at how how do we

55
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:44,598
prepare for hemp agriculture on a scale

56
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,598
that it can truly make a

57
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:54,640
difference a real

58
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:58,158
farmer may not take a crop seriously if

59
00:02:54,639 --> 00:03:00,679
he cannot grow 500 Acres of it so what

60
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:05,039
do we need in order to be ready for a

61
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:07,280
500 acre crop of hemp seed making the

62
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:10,878
assumption that you get a hundredfold

63
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:15,080
increase with each crop the year before

64
00:03:10,878 --> 00:03:17,679
we need to have a 5 acre seed crop

65
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:20,879
dedicated to producing the seed for our

66
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:24,319
500 acre crop the year before that you

67
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:26,280
need 5 hunds of an acre which is roughly

68
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:30,039
20 foot by 20

69
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:33,840
foot and the year before that you need

70
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:37,199
100th of that which is 2T by

71
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:41,039
2T that's one plant so it means that we

72
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:44,158
are four years away from selecting one

73
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:46,438
plant that meets our needs to having

74
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:48,798
enough seed to where you can have a 500

75
00:03:46,438 --> 00:03:48,799
acre

76
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:55,158
crop we need to move forward in ways

77
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:58,959
where we

78
00:03:55,158 --> 00:04:01,639
build on our foundations and we are

79
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:04,158
prepared for the the successes my

80
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:07,958
grandmother always said success is what

81
00:04:04,158 --> 00:04:11,199
happens when preparation meets an

82
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:12,799
opportunity and so I've spent much of my

83
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:15,679
life

84
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:18,840
preparing for various successes that

85
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:21,959
have shown their face and this is yet

86
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:21,959
another one
