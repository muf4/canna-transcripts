1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:05,679
um next let's switch to the topic of

2
00:00:02,759 --> 00:00:07,479
some uh Municipal initiatives and in

3
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:09,039
this case one that's been stalled

4
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:11,240
temporarily but we think only

5
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:13,599
temporarily matab Bell is going to talk

6
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:15,599
about an initiative in Detroit Michigan

7
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:16,920
Matt is a very active member in fact a

8
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,920
life member of the normal legal

9
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:22,679
committee uh he founded cannabis Council

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:27,039
a practice entirely consistent of

11
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:29,239
medical of cannabis cases and clients um

12
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,800
but more importantly what I've seen over

13
00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:33,439
the last year whatever since I guess

14
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,200
about a year now since Michigan's had

15
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:39,558
that new initiative is Matt is truly the

16
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:41,960
go-to guy on these important questions

17
00:00:39,558 --> 00:00:44,519
in Michigan but again instead of having

18
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:46,320
him talk about the medical use law today

19
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,600
I'd like for him to talk about what's

20
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,320
going on with that initiative that we

21
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:53,679
expected to be on the ballot this

22
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,679
November in Michigan

23
00:00:58,238 --> 00:01:04,920
Matt uh thank you keth and happy normal

24
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:07,000
everyone it's good to be here um I'm a

25
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,118
lawyer in Detroit and uh there are some

26
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,319
activists in Detroit who uh approached

27
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:14,200
me and and uh said they wanted to do

28
00:01:11,319 --> 00:01:16,399
something uh further to uh try to

29
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:18,840
decriminalize marijuana or move the move

30
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,159
the ball even a little bit uh Tim Beck

31
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,759
is the person who actually put the

32
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,880
language together and and then um had

33
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:26,719
the petitions printed came to me and and

34
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:28,719
someone else and asked for funding and

35
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:30,759
three of us just kicked in a little bit

36
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:33,078
to print it and toay pay some

37
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:36,118
circulators we didn't even need a th000

38
00:01:33,078 --> 00:01:38,319
signatures for this so if if initiative

39
00:01:36,118 --> 00:01:42,799
is available to you in your state or

40
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:44,718
your municipality or your county um do

41
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:47,799
it you know take a look at at the city

42
00:01:44,718 --> 00:01:49,438
Charter the county Charter um if that is

43
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:51,719
available there are all kinds of ways

44
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:53,438
that we can do this on a smaller level

45
00:01:51,718 --> 00:01:55,919
to make inroads and that's what we were

46
00:01:53,438 --> 00:01:58,839
trying to do in Detroit the Detroit City

47
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:01,200
Charter allows citizen initiative and it

48
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:04,200
didn't require whole ton of signatures

49
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:07,118
so we printed some petitions that said

50
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:09,920
um this would amend the Detroit city

51
00:02:07,118 --> 00:02:12,598
code to exempt adults possessing or

52
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:15,878
using marijuana on private property by

53
00:02:12,598 --> 00:02:17,799
amending the uh the code section um and

54
00:02:15,878 --> 00:02:19,518
to add this section none of the

55
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:21,680
provisions of this article shall apply

56
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:24,120
to the use or possession of less than 1

57
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,879
ounce of marijuana on private property

58
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:28,879
by a person who has attained the age of

59
00:02:25,878 --> 00:02:32,359
21 years and then we reprinted the

60
00:02:28,878 --> 00:02:34,159
entire controll substances ordinances in

61
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:36,560
the city of Detroit and just added that

62
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:38,919
section so it requires you to put all

63
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,439
the language there that might be

64
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:43,238
affected so better safe than sorry in

65
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:46,400
fact we uh printed them once and there

66
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:48,640
was some small uh heading that wasn't in

67
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,640
bold and it was completely reprinted

68
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:53,919
that cost a couple hundred but it's

69
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:58,359
important to have the details right too

70
00:02:53,919 --> 00:03:00,119
um which anyway um what happened was we

71
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:04,319
circulated the petitions we paid

72
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:07,439
petitioners a dollar a signature and

73
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:09,399
um those were filed with the county

74
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:10,959
clerk I'm sorry with the city clerk they

75
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,959
were filed with the city clerk the city

76
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:15,840
clerk counted them um and they had

77
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:18,239
sufficient signatures under the law they

78
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,719
were good and then it was submitted to

79
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:23,400
the election commission to set the

80
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:25,080
language to go on the ballot and Tim and

81
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,760
I appeared at the election commission

82
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:29,319
hearing and instead of considering

83
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:31,039
language The Corporation Council one of

84
00:03:29,318 --> 00:03:34,399
the three members of this commission

85
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:37,639
said uh we can't do this this is illegal

86
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:39,480
and I move it uh that it be denied and

87
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:42,039
we just can this and that's what

88
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:45,840
happened now they had written a legal

89
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:48,039
opinion which we only found that day and

90
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,560
obtained a copy of it saying that they

91
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:53,120
felt it was illegal for two reasons um

92
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,959
that it was preempted by federal law and

93
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:58,680
that it was advisory only in nature and

94
00:03:55,959 --> 00:04:01,959
and neither of those is true or accurate

95
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,799
but uh so we sued them is what happened

96
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:06,519
this is a copy of the lawsuit that I

97
00:04:03,799 --> 00:04:08,319
filed in Wayne County in Detroit and uh

98
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:10,920
we got an order to show cause against

99
00:04:08,318 --> 00:04:12,759
the uh the city clerk and the um

100
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:15,759
Election Commission the head of the city

101
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:18,680
council and um we appeared at the

102
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:21,759
hearing and at the mandamus hearing the

103
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:23,439
judge said this violates the law and I'm

104
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,720
not going to order that it be placed on

105
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:30,680
the ballot and U basically make me kind

106
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:33,479
of um and so we're going to um

107
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:35,199
but not right away uh the timing is such

108
00:04:33,478 --> 00:04:38,680
that the ballots are are being printed

109
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:41,038
already now and the politics are such

110
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:44,720
that while the court of appeals our next

111
00:04:41,038 --> 00:04:47,918
step um might if they want to uh hear a

112
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:50,039
case in three or 4 days it typically

113
00:04:47,918 --> 00:04:52,000
takes roughly a year and a half from the

114
00:04:50,038 --> 00:04:54,560
date all the briefs have been filed and

115
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,038
are sitting in the court um before they

116
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,720
hear the case well at least a year

117
00:04:57,038 --> 00:05:01,120
so um looking at that what we've decided

118
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:03,080
to do is we're filing a motion for

119
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,639
rehearing in front of this judge

120
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:08,240
explaining a little more how he's wrong

121
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:10,240
because um he didn't really um hear us

122
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,400
out all that much he had his mind made

123
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,918
up and we'd like to show him what a

124
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:17,038
stupid uh decision that was if you

125
00:05:14,918 --> 00:05:19,318
excuse me that's a legal term you can

126
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:22,079
look it

127
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:24,639
up and we want to show him some other

128
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:26,879
things that um I didn't have and didn't

129
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:29,079
think were necessary like a copy of the

130
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:32,000
Detroit medical marijuana law that was

131
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:34,519
passed in 2004 four years before our

132
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,959
state law which was put on the ballot

133
00:05:34,519 --> 00:05:42,198
and wasn't preempted and wasn't advisory

134
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:43,879
and um he asked me uh how you know what

135
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:46,759
what actual effect it would have how is

136
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:48,079
it not advisory and I said well you know

137
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:49,840
an officer wouldn't be able to write a

138
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:52,399
ticket under city code that he can write

139
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:54,879
today you know that's a big practical

140
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:58,159
difference and then he he made up some

141
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:59,839
some crazy analogies that um were not on

142
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,960
point and I explained that to him him

143
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:05,799
and he said good point and we moved on

144
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:07,638
and uh anyway uh we are going to be

145
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:10,680
filing a motion for rehearing in front

146
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:13,478
of the same judge and um we expect it'll

147
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:15,720
be denied but it'll our brief will be

148
00:06:13,478 --> 00:06:17,279
much thicker and and more professional

149
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:19,319
ready to go to the court of appeals we

150
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:21,079
kind of thought it was a lay down but it

151
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:23,120
was uh it was all over before we got

152
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:25,758
there so um when we go to the court of

153
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:28,199
appeals uh we'll have all the legal

154
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:30,479
arguments already laid out in the lower

155
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:33,478
court which is uh better way for us to

156
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:36,079
do it and um the timing is such that it

157
00:06:33,478 --> 00:06:38,399
looks like if and when we win this it'll

158
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:40,879
probably be either a special election

159
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:43,318
which will be rather interesting or um

160
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:47,639
it could be even two years from now um

161
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:50,598
in the uh the 2012 elections so um we

162
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:53,800
are slowed but not deterred and we're

163
00:06:50,598 --> 00:06:55,519
going to move forward and the actually I

164
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,960
thought that first of all I thought

165
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:59,598
there was no way we were going to lose I

166
00:06:56,959 --> 00:07:01,560
was so confident when I went to court um

167
00:06:59,598 --> 00:07:03,598
although I I never get overconfident you

168
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:05,519
never I never say it's a done deal but I

169
00:07:03,598 --> 00:07:08,000
felt very good about the case because

170
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:12,279
the law really is very strongly on our

171
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,639
side and um when we lost I I I was

172
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:18,959
surprised that I wasn't depressed or

173
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:21,519
dejected I was invigorated by um by more

174
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:24,799
of the Injustice that that's still

175
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:27,079
coming from the government and so that

176
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,199
had the reverse effect that I expected

177
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:31,159
but it was a good thing for all of us

178
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,919
and I'm reinvigorated and I'm willing

179
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:35,960
and ready to press on forward in this

180
00:07:33,918 --> 00:07:38,079
and so we're gone but not forgotten or

181
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:40,839
we're forgotten now but not gone we'll

182
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:45,800
be back put it that way uh one way or

183
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:45,799
another so all right thank you very much
