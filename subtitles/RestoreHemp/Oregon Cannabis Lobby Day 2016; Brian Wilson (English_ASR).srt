00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,950
I'm Brian Wilson i go by Brian the red

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:10,888
I've been an activist my entire life

3
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:13,589
seriously and to see the changes that

4
00:00:10,888 --> 00:00:17,250
they are trying to make to the programs

5
00:00:13,589 --> 00:00:20,339
that we voted in as a people it really

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:23,278
turns my stomach I worked on the medical

7
00:00:20,339 --> 00:00:25,259
campaigns back in the 90s because my

8
00:00:23,278 --> 00:00:27,300
father had a broken back and

9
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:30,179
degenerative disc disease since before I

10
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:33,120
was born the only thing that could get

11
00:00:30,178 --> 00:00:35,699
him up out of laying in agony in bed not

12
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:38,899
even able to tie his own shoes for weeks

13
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:42,329
at a time was a small puff of cannabis

14
00:00:38,899 --> 00:00:45,450
that small miracle got him up out of bed

15
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:49,469
and taking four to five mile bike rides

16
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:53,100
with my brothers and I that's why I

17
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:57,058
fought for this recently I lost a really

18
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:59,850
good friend to brain cancer it was a GBM

19
00:00:57,058 --> 00:01:01,890
glioblastoma multiforme stage four and

20
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:04,379
usually people when they get the

21
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:07,950
diagnosis of that condition they aren't

22
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:13,740
given more than about nine weeks he

23
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:17,310
survived 22 months and died just last

24
00:01:13,739 --> 00:01:19,560
month not in a hospital surrounded by

25
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:22,280
machines and incompetent doctors but in

26
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:29,609
his home surrounded by his family

27
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:31,978
comfortable you know the people in these

28
00:01:29,609 --> 00:01:37,590
buildings they don't realize the lives

29
00:01:31,978 --> 00:01:39,900
that their pen strokes effect until it's

30
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:42,810
their grandparents it's their brother

31
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:46,920
it's their father their mother their

32
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:49,950
sister or themself they need to wake up

33
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:52,228
and realize that people are dying every

34
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:55,020
day and for them to look at the ledger

35
00:01:52,228 --> 00:02:00,718
and see only dollar signs and the taxes

36
00:01:55,019 --> 00:02:05,209
that can come in to fund the programs

37
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:05,209
that we don't even give a crap about

38
00:02:05,469 --> 00:02:12,099
it makes me really sad you know and but

39
00:02:10,118 --> 00:02:14,110
to see all you guys out here fighting

40
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:16,810
that makes me happy it means that we've

41
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:18,970
got a chance that there is a future here

42
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:22,319
and that there's a bright possibility

43
00:02:18,969 --> 00:02:24,939
that we will get everything we want

44
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:28,079
recreational is a great thing it's not

45
00:02:24,939 --> 00:02:30,729
exactly the freedom that we all want

46
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,310
people thought that once it passed hey

47
00:02:30,729 --> 00:02:37,359
we are at the finish line no this is

48
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:39,729
just the bottom of a hill we are at the

49
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:43,140
forefront of the greatest race of our

50
00:02:39,729 --> 00:02:46,959
lives and we need to keep running until

51
00:02:43,139 --> 00:02:50,769
we get the rights that we deserve to be

52
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:53,280
treated like regular people and for

53
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:56,080
people who don't have options to

54
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:59,709
actually have something that they can

55
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:01,480
turn to besides up sorry what you want

56
00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:03,069
some pharmaceuticals here will put you

57
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:05,099
on the roller coaster that doesn't work

58
00:03:03,069 --> 00:03:07,719
for a while we'll try this other pill

59
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:10,419
also they can line the pockets of some

60
00:03:07,719 --> 00:03:14,650
big businessman he lives in a high-rise

61
00:03:10,419 --> 00:03:16,839
apartment and jets around that's not us

62
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:20,680
that's not the people that's not America

63
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:22,900
and that's definitely not Oregon so

64
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:24,550
we're going to keep fighting you guys

65
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:27,280
better hear us in that building because

66
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:30,640
we're not going anywhere until we get

67
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:34,769
what we want and what we deserve as

68
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:34,768
human beings thank you
