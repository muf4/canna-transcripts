1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,520
my name is andrea herman and i've come

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:07,359
to oregon state university

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:09,439
as a co-lecturer for wse 266

4
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:10,400
ecampus course on industrial hemp

5
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:12,480
underneath the

6
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:17,920
college of forestry's renewable

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,920
materials section

8
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,320
well over the last couple of days i've

9
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:24,000
learned that here in oregon there are a

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,599
lot of press board factories and of

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
course since you have ample amounts of

12
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:29,278
wood here but we are also focusing on

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,159
how we can

14
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:33,759
change the dynamics of how we're using

15
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:36,000
those wood products and looking at what

16
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:37,519
other products we can incorporate in

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,840
also i've learned that there's been a

18
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,680
decline in the need for the grass seed

19
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,120
production here so that opens up acreage

20
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:44,799
for hemp cultivation

21
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:46,878
we also have companies here that are

22
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:48,640
already milling products into

23
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:50,479
powders and food grade products so

24
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,320
that's something that oregon

25
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:59,679
oregon can readily pick up and include

26
00:00:52,320 --> 00:01:01,519
in their production and market zone

27
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:03,280
i think here in oregon particularly you

28
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,960
know you want to call up senator white

29
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,519
in merkley's office and tell them thank

30
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,118
you

31
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,040
let them know that you're a constituent

32
00:01:07,118 --> 00:01:10,799
and that you care about this issue and

33
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,040
and let them know if you do have any

34
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,840
concerns about industrial hemp in your

35
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,920
area

36
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,759
and beyond that if you have family and

37
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,920
it's in any other state

38
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,759
call them talk with them start talking

39
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,439
about this at lunch at the supper table

40
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,319
make that communication flow start to

41
00:01:23,438 --> 00:01:25,839
open up

42
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:27,438
and i think we're never going to have

43
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,880
that federal bill pass unless people

44
00:01:27,438 --> 00:01:31,118
voice their opinion

45
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:32,640
so like i say if you're if your senator

46
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:34,000
is already a sponsor

47
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,079
call them and say thank you if they're

48
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,078
not a sponsor call them and let them

49
00:01:36,078 --> 00:01:38,959
know and don't just call once call more

50
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:40,959
than once

51
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:42,640
have your your family your colleagues

52
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:44,319
your husband your kids make the phone

53
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,040
call the more phone calls we make the

54
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:46,319
diff

55
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:54,719
the better and the more difference it

56
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:59,280
will end up making in the long run

57
00:01:54,719 --> 00:02:01,519
don't give up yeah don't give up i think

58
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,718
you know i mean for me this is something

59
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:05,840
that you know

60
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:08,079
was a dream for me i i felt passion and

61
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,598
and i had a lot of desire to see where

62
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,760
hemp was going to go

63
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:13,519
it became a passion it became my dream

64
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:14,719
it became a goal internally and

65
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,040
externally

66
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:18,878
and fortunately enough i i stuck with it

67
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:19,280
and and that's what's led me down this

68
00:02:18,878 --> 00:02:20,878
path

69
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,039
so i hope that other people will be able

70
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:24,878
to follow in in my path

71
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:26,239
and through this course being offered at

72
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:28,479
osu it's really going to open the

73
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:30,719
opportunity for people to really follow

74
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:32,639
their dream academia wise

75
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:34,239
and then be producing professionals

76
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:36,719
coming out of

77
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:38,640
the universities that are ready to go

78
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:40,400
into the hemp marketplace and and

79
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:41,759
provide background and institutional

80
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:46,239
knowledge that otherwise we

81
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:46,239
don't have right now in the sector
