1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:04,359
there is a Canadian seed growing

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:06,719
Association they been producing Their

3
00:00:04,359 --> 00:00:08,199
Own Foundation seed they've been

4
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:10,000
producing foundation and what you

5
00:00:08,199 --> 00:00:12,279
normally have in seed development is you

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,359
have breeder seed you have Foundation

7
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:17,719
seed you have uh registered seed and

8
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:20,439
certified seed those four classes so

9
00:00:17,719 --> 00:00:23,640
there's a 4-year period in the evolution

10
00:00:20,439 --> 00:00:27,679
of any certified seed the the uh the

11
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:30,080
national seed protection act provides um

12
00:00:27,678 --> 00:00:32,159
the the legal framework for handling the

13
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:33,759
genetics of seeds inside of the United

14
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:36,878
States and it's consistent with

15
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:38,839
International treaties now the Canadian

16
00:00:36,878 --> 00:00:41,920
regulations that they're operating by go

17
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:45,760
far beyond the the restrictions of the

18
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:49,280
of the seed variety protection act um

19
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:53,000
because under the uh seed protection act

20
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:55,719
um a farmer can save seed enough to

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:00,039
plant their own

22
00:00:55,719 --> 00:01:02,120
acreage of a of a tier one of tier one

23
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:03,719
of tier one seeds there are many

24
00:01:02,119 --> 00:01:06,719
heirloom seeds that there is no

25
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:10,519
restriction on it um I have a lot to

26
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:12,319
learn about the nature of those laws and

27
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:14,560
those are the rules I believe we going

28
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:18,158
going by Colorado is going to be doing

29
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:23,478
it its own way Colorado is not Canada MH

30
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:25,520
um and color I'm from Colorado yeah and

31
00:01:23,478 --> 00:01:28,039
we value our autonomy and our

32
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:30,118
independence greatly and uh we've gotten

33
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:34,320
advice from some of the best Minds in

34
00:01:30,118 --> 00:01:37,478
the world mhm um and this is a very very

35
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:37,478
exciting time
