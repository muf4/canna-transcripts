1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,959
one of those is a hempcrete balls to

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:06,990
what you have here is the inner core

3
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:08,638
portion of the stock which is similar to

4
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:10,440
some of what we have here in this bag

5
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:13,048
the little woody portions that you see

6
00:00:10,439 --> 00:00:15,359
in here and then we mix this with a line

7
00:00:13,048 --> 00:00:16,890
binder and water and this becomes a non

8
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:19,919
structural component of the wall

9
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:22,260
insulation or you can compress them into

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,080
blocks to have construction structural

11
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:26,849
components of the wall it's breathable

12
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:28,139
resistant to mold resistant to fire and

13
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:30,660
you can learn more about that at hemp

14
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:32,549
dash technologies com and so that's

15
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,960
carbon negative this is a carbon

16
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:36,238
negative is what the tests have shown

17
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,530
for our colleagues in the UK now this is

18
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:39,238
one of the reasons why we want to be

19
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:41,308
cultivating industrial hemp in this

20
00:00:39,238 --> 00:00:43,709
country is it so that we can start to

21
00:00:41,308 --> 00:00:45,539
coordinating those stocks to create that

22
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:47,820
heard that will need to go into this

23
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:51,030
building application and not only can

24
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:54,090
you use this heard in hempcrete but you

25
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:57,230
can also use it in a hemp block here's a

26
00:00:54,090 --> 00:01:00,960
little bitty piece of a pressed board

27
00:00:57,229 --> 00:01:03,148
and this also is using the hemp heard

28
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,519
and then press this is made in Canada

29
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:08,070
nice just a little bitty press block

30
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,200
there keep all this organized by the

31
00:01:08,069 --> 00:01:12,779
feedback and then right here we have a

32
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:15,299
hemp insulation so this is a pink

33
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:17,159
insulation replacement and you can get

34
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:20,700
this in various sizes and of course it's

35
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:22,409
cut to be 15 or 16 inches depending on

36
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:24,329
what you need it can come with or

37
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:26,790
without a fire retardant depending on

38
00:01:24,329 --> 00:01:29,548
your needs in building code so here we

39
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:32,009
have I think these are both made in like

40
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:34,049
a needle punch machine as a non woven

41
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:36,569
matting this is a very thin piece so you

42
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:39,000
could use this as what is essentially

43
00:01:36,569 --> 00:01:41,250
made into this briefcase right here is

44
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,618
this type of matting that is in molded

45
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:46,920
and infused you could also use this as

46
00:01:43,618 --> 00:01:51,328
something to go underneath a counter

47
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:53,219
tops or as perhaps soil retention and

48
00:01:51,328 --> 00:01:56,819
last but not least what we have here is

49
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:58,769
the bast fiber on the inside so this is

50
00:01:56,819 --> 00:02:00,809
the outside of the stock and these are

51
00:01:58,769 --> 00:02:03,118
the long bast fibres that you would use

52
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:06,509
to make those non woven Madden's and to

53
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:07,920
make the hemp insulation so I said last

54
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:10,618
but there's one more item here you have

55
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,789
him fast fibers yep hey bird fiber you

56
00:02:10,618 --> 00:02:13,680
want to tell our audience the difference

57
00:02:11,789 --> 00:02:15,959
between the two yeah so this is the

58
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,459
woody core on the inside this is the

59
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:19,378
hemp heard you can see this in all

60
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:21,780
cannabis plants they all have the long

61
00:02:19,378 --> 00:02:23,280
bass fiber on the outside and that bast

62
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:25,140
fiber on the outside is what our

63
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,968
colleagues like in China are using to

64
00:02:25,139 --> 00:02:29,039
make the amazing textiles such as what I

65
00:02:26,968 --> 00:02:31,530
have on right now this is hemp or iam

66
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:33,598
from South Africa and then the inner

67
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:34,949
core here is the woody portion but you

68
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:36,929
could also use this in type of

69
00:02:34,949 --> 00:02:38,938
applications such as gasification to

70
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:41,549
create heat in greenhouses and in homes

71
00:02:38,938 --> 00:02:43,500
so this is a variable or animal bedding

72
00:02:41,549 --> 00:02:45,150
amazing for animal bedding we just

73
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,859
cleaned out our chicken coop and we had

74
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:49,408
the top part with straw and underneath

75
00:02:46,859 --> 00:02:51,659
we had the hemp hurt and so surprising

76
00:02:49,408 --> 00:02:53,400
in Canada our minus 30 whether how the

77
00:02:51,658 --> 00:02:55,530
hemp heard was still really light and

78
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:59,299
fluffy and it was able to remove the

79
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:59,299
straw quite quickly well thank you
