1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:06,560
hey you know marijuana is the most

2
00:00:03,718 --> 00:00:10,599
important plant on this

3
00:00:06,559 --> 00:00:13,079
planet it is produces more fuel from its

4
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:16,440
seed more fiber from its stem more

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:19,278
medicine from its flowers and leaves uh

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:21,400
than any other plant and that's the

7
00:00:19,278 --> 00:00:23,320
reason it was made illegal it was really

8
00:00:21,399 --> 00:00:25,358
the petrochemical pharmaceutical

9
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:27,278
military industrial transnational

10
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:30,480
corporate Elite fascist sons of a

11
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:33,000
[ __ ] who made up the mar

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,000
Miss they said there's this thing out

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,039
there marijuana that causes us to go

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,119
crazy and kill our family and friends

15
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:43,399
what could be more [ __ ] than that

16
00:00:40,119 --> 00:00:46,759
you know no you can drive your car on

17
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:48,280
pure hip seed oil and that's the reason

18
00:00:46,759 --> 00:00:51,359
it is

19
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:54,039
illegal so you know finally we've got

20
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:56,039
some limited legalization here in

21
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:59,320
Washington you can possess an ounce but

22
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:01,558
you can't grow your own that's not good

23
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:04,118
enough we need to be able to grow our

24
00:01:01,558 --> 00:01:07,200
own plants we need to grow the plant

25
00:01:04,118 --> 00:01:10,280
that is the most productive plant on the

26
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:13,040
planet maybe the plant from which

27
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:15,680
agriculture was founded it might be the

28
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,920
oldest crop all archaeologists agree

29
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:21,600
it's been cultivated at least 12,000

30
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:25,879
years you should be able to grow

31
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:29,438
it register to vote there's an i

32
00:01:25,879 --> 00:01:32,438
739 petition Booth right over there we

33
00:01:29,438 --> 00:01:34,919
need you to sign those petitions even

34
00:01:32,438 --> 00:01:36,839
better get some petitions and get other

35
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,519
Washington registered voters to sign

36
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,920
them because that's how we make change

37
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:43,718
if it wasn't for that they'd be throwing

38
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,920
us all in jail

39
00:01:43,718 --> 00:01:49,199
still we don't want that to happen

40
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:54,439
obviously you know the legislature

41
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:57,600
passed a bad law 5052 to curtail medical

42
00:01:54,438 --> 00:02:00,559
marijuana but I have a series of clinics

43
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:02,599
where we have helped over aund ,000

44
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:06,039
Washington residents get their medical

45
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:10,239
marijuana permit over a qu million

46
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:12,159
Americans so far and those people are

47
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,560
able to legally possess use and grow

48
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:17,318
marijuana but the state has curtailed

49
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:20,280
that they're saying you can grow 15

50
00:02:17,318 --> 00:02:23,318
plants till next July but next July you

51
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:26,400
can only grow four here's a petition

52
00:02:23,318 --> 00:02:29,199
right here so we urge you guys to get

53
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,640
these petitions sign them and pass them

54
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:33,598
around because that's the only way we're

55
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:35,799
going to be able to change these laws

56
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:39,560
and contact your legislature because

57
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:39,560
that's another way to have

58
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:45,680
input anyway Washington voters you know

59
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:48,440
420 is coming up this is probably the

60
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:51,959
most fun place to be at that special

61
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:56,680
time so hey it's only about 15 minutes

62
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:58,319
