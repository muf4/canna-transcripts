1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:05,459
so just said I'm Roger Goodman I'm the

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:07,500
state representative that chair of the

3
00:00:05,459 --> 00:00:11,129
house Public Safety Committee in the

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:12,780
House of Representatives and Kennedy's

5
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:13,980
used to be in my jurisdiction they used

6
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:15,899
to be illegal but now it's in the

7
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:20,070
Commerce Committee Chair six which is

8
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:21,630
pretty cool and we now have not just the

9
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:23,730
Liquor Control Board the liquor and

10
00:00:21,629 --> 00:00:26,518
cannabis for officially as of a few

11
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:29,550
weeks ago so a lot of changes happening

12
00:00:26,518 --> 00:00:33,269
here in Washington helping to lead the

13
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:35,880
world again it's really sort of parallel

14
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:37,950
universes we cannot forget what's going

15
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:39,480
on in the rest of the country and some

16
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:41,760
are making more progress so that others

17
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:44,459
but I've washington needs to be careful

18
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:46,378
as we continue to lead the way but so

19
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:49,170
far I think it's it's doing well doing

20
00:00:46,378 --> 00:00:52,170
well enough the market or commercial

21
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:53,609
market has a time to settle down we have

22
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:56,219
to worry about people who are truly

23
00:00:53,609 --> 00:00:58,530
medically needy people who don't want to

24
00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:00,820
take the toxic let your chemical

25
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:02,829
pharmaceuticals

26
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:05,198
and they depend on it and they need a

27
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:09,790
lot of it I don't smoke and vaporize it

28
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:11,829
in soil and digested and it's they don't

29
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:13,750
they can't afford it so I'm worried

30
00:01:11,829 --> 00:01:15,579
about that in the legislature I'm going

31
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:18,069
to continue to be a voice to take care

32
00:01:15,579 --> 00:01:19,959
of the truly medically needy on the

33
00:01:18,069 --> 00:01:21,579
other hand we have not really on the

34
00:01:19,959 --> 00:01:24,159
other hand another issue major issue is

35
00:01:21,579 --> 00:01:27,429
the market itself this new legal market

36
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:30,519
or so far I think this is a showcase we

37
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:32,740
have a lot of flaws and yet with more

38
00:01:30,519 --> 00:01:36,250
retail availability of a sort of a

39
00:01:32,739 --> 00:01:39,250
supply a taxation that makes sense of a

40
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:41,618
quaint years to adjust we will again

41
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:44,680
show the world how it should be done so

42
00:01:41,618 --> 00:01:52,299
the dam has burst cannabis prohibition

43
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:54,520
is over the war on marijuana is over and

44
00:01:52,299 --> 00:01:56,049
we'll look back on history you know but

45
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:57,939
we were still fighting it and still cost

46
00:01:56,049 --> 00:02:00,069
a lot and so forth but in the minds of

47
00:01:57,939 --> 00:02:03,009
Americans it really analyzed the world

48
00:02:00,069 --> 00:02:05,079
the war on marijuana is over so to

49
00:02:03,009 --> 00:02:07,750
preside over that after having been a

50
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:10,569
drug policy reform her and when I got

51
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:12,969
elected oh they hit me hard he wants to

52
00:02:10,569 --> 00:02:14,680
legalize marijuana blood vote went way

53
00:02:12,969 --> 00:02:16,389
up after that after the people found out

54
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:19,930
the people are way ahead of the

55
00:02:16,389 --> 00:02:22,059
politicians the opinion leaders and so

56
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:23,769
it's fun to be ahead of the curve and to

57
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:26,349
kind of say I told you so but we're

58
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:28,090
doing it right and so it's part I'm

59
00:02:26,349 --> 00:02:29,979
proud to be a part of that so thank you

60
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:32,759
