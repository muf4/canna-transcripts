00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,410
Thank You Ted thanks everybody for being

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:07,139
here I'm Tobias read I'm a Beaverton

3
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:10,199
state representative and I hope not only

4
00:00:07,139 --> 00:00:13,439
to follow Ted wheeler on stage but into

5
00:00:10,199 --> 00:00:15,750
office as State Treasurer you know

6
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:18,719
Oregon is a pioneer we're not the first

7
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:21,000
state to legalize but we're still well

8
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:23,278
ahead of the curve it means that the

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,439
decisions we make in Oregon are going to

10
00:00:23,278 --> 00:00:29,129
be the ones that the rest of the country

11
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:31,528
looks to when they legalize all over the

12
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:34,890
state legal cannabis businesses are off

13
00:00:31,528 --> 00:00:38,609
to a really strong start exceeding

14
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:41,820
expectations 14 million dollars in sales

15
00:00:38,609 --> 00:00:44,429
in January alone that doesn't even count

16
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:47,009
medicinal marijuana and when extracts

17
00:00:44,429 --> 00:00:50,399
and edibles come online that is going to

18
00:00:47,009 --> 00:00:52,589
only increase the number but because the

19
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:55,350
federal government is dragging its feet

20
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:58,410
it's leaving states like Oregon in a

21
00:00:55,350 --> 00:01:01,079
bind banks and credit unions can't

22
00:00:58,409 --> 00:01:03,328
confidently extend their services to

23
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:06,210
legal cannabis businesses without

24
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:09,780
risking the violation of federal law and

25
00:01:06,209 --> 00:01:11,669
imagine how dangerous and scary that is

26
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:14,129
for cannabis business owners perhaps

27
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:16,290
some of you are among them you have to

28
00:01:14,129 --> 00:01:20,280
keep thousands of dollars in cash on

29
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:24,420
hand to meet payroll to pay taxes and

30
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:26,849
buy inventory and supplies we have to do

31
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:28,530
better than that and while we haven't

32
00:01:26,849 --> 00:01:30,118
solved all our problems that's one of

33
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:32,759
the reasons I helped to pass the

34
00:01:30,118 --> 00:01:35,188
cannabis banking bill in Oregon in the

35
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:38,509
legislature the federal government still

36
00:01:35,188 --> 00:01:41,039
needs act but we're one step closer by

37
00:01:38,509 --> 00:01:43,109
removing criminal liability in Oregon

38
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,719
for the provision of banking services

39
00:01:43,109 --> 00:01:48,030
we're helping to remove those duffel

40
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:50,069
bags of cash that are moving around our

41
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:52,950
neighborhoods and putting businesses and

42
00:01:50,069 --> 00:01:55,228
neighborhoods at risk we've got lots

43
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:57,210
more to do but this is an important

44
00:01:55,228 --> 00:01:58,859
first step and I hope you'll all be with

45
00:01:57,209 --> 00:02:00,599
me as we continue that effort I

46
00:01:58,859 --> 00:02:02,728
appreciate you being here and wish you

47
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:04,938
great luck on a successful event thanks

48
00:02:02,728 --> 00:02:04,938
very much
