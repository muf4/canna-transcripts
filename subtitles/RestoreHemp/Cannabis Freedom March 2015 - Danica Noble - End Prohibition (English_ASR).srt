1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,919
and we need to free the people who are

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:08,460
in prison for pot we need to free the

3
00:00:04,919 --> 00:00:11,699
children who are held hostage by CPS

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:14,400
away from their loving families

5
00:00:11,699 --> 00:00:16,739
and we need to restore the rights of

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,420
those who have been stunted by felony

7
00:00:16,739 --> 00:00:21,959
drug convictions

8
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:24,179
fairness equality social justice equal

9
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:26,219
opportunity

10
00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:27,858
just injustice is here and it's

11
00:00:26,219 --> 00:00:30,239
happening

12
00:00:27,859 --> 00:00:31,800
now the human solution is going to come

13
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:34,379
up and give a message and they may talk

14
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,140
about Sean abanda who is fighting today

15
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:39,780
for her 11 year old son marijuana

16
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:42,299
changed her life and she educated her

17
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:43,620
community and her son and when he

18
00:00:42,299 --> 00:00:45,479
corrected

19
00:00:43,619 --> 00:00:48,179
the school that was giving

20
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:50,699
misinformation they took that 11 year

21
00:00:48,179 --> 00:00:52,619
old in kept him in custody

22
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:54,359
raided his mother's home took her

23
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:57,359
medicine and her son and she's fighting

24
00:00:54,359 --> 00:01:00,299
for him and that's today and even in

25
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:01,738
Colorado where I remind you marijuana is

26
00:01:00,299 --> 00:01:04,319
legal

27
00:01:01,738 --> 00:01:06,359
Angel price Lane was taken from her

28
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,798
parents when she was 11 months old

29
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:09,118
because her father said he

30
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:10,680
recreationally smoked marijuana

31
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:11,700
occasionally I remind you again it was

32
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,520
legal

33
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:17,040
within a month that baby was given to a

34
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:20,219
19 year old who had three other kids and

35
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,560
she died that month a blunt forced to

36
00:01:20,219 --> 00:01:24,438
the Head repeated blunt force to the

37
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,400
Head

38
00:01:24,438 --> 00:01:28,559
there are people who are losing their

39
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,000
jobs there are people who are losing

40
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,960
their children and there are people in

41
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,099
prison

42
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:37,978
and it is our right to be here to speak

43
00:01:35,099 --> 00:01:40,019
and to to exercise those rights but it's

44
00:01:37,978 --> 00:01:41,640
also our duty to be the voice of those

45
00:01:40,019 --> 00:01:44,340
people who can't be heard because they

46
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:46,618
are in prison or they are held

47
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:49,140
their children are gone

48
00:01:46,618 --> 00:01:51,299
so we need a bill that automatically

49
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:55,500
causes review of anybody serving time

50
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:58,439
for pot we need protections for parents

51
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:01,399
so that responsible use is not a reason

52
00:01:58,438 --> 00:02:01,398
to take kids away

53
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:07,200
and in the four states in DC that have

54
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:08,639
legalized recreational use and in the

55
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,878
more than 20 states that have medical

56
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:14,098
laws nobody has protected prisoners yet

57
00:02:11,878 --> 00:02:16,919
so make it a part of every cannabis

58
00:02:14,098 --> 00:02:19,199
conversation Justice equality equal

59
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:22,378
