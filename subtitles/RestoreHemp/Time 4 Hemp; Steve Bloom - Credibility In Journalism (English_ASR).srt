heard for a long time and high times

00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,160

12
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:27,839
on bringing information about the hand

13
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,800

in any aspect that they can

16
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:34,719
at the same time you've also had to deal

17
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,719
with some problems over the past few

18
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:37,759
years we want to talk about all of that

19
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,239
first of all

20
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:41,839
the uh voice that you put together high

21
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:43,119
times magazine how did that all come

22
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,840
about

23
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:48,320
we're based in new york city

24
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,000
we're a fairly small operation magazine

25
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,439
publishing company

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,198
that publishes high times as well as a

27
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:54,558
couple of other magazines

28
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:55,679
and

29
00:00:54,558 --> 00:00:57,119
we

30
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:58,479
we turn out a magazine every month like

31
00:00:57,119 --> 00:00:59,759
everybody else does you know in our

32
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:01,279
business you know we're no different

33
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:03,839
than most people when it comes to that

34
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:06,560
it's our job to write headlines to

35
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,478
assign to bring in photos to do all the

36
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,079
leg work that it takes to get the whole

37
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:11,359
magazine produced from beginning to end

38
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:12,959
that's what we do we're all

39
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:14,719
professionals at that

40
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:16,959
and then by the way we're also advocates

41
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:18,879
you know that's what makes it unusual

42
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:20,719
okay now the fact that you are advocates

43
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:22,399
and you're out there with your neck on

44
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:24,319
the line being willing to put your face

45
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,719
and your time and talent out

46
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:28,719
there for people to see and to enjoy and

47
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:31,599
learn from it's also caused you some

48
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:32,719
problems um in new orleans you were

49
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:34,158
subpoenaed

50
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:36,400
into court

51
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:38,719
and a problem came up that

52
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:41,280
many people know about but not not in

53
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:42,959
full detail well we've documented it you

54
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,799
know in high times and

55
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:46,478
and it's been documented uh by the

56
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,600
mainstream press as we like to sort of

57
00:01:46,478 --> 00:01:50,239
call it

58
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:51,839
washington post wall street journal

59
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:54,478
usa today they've looked into our

60
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,399
situation what was going on there and

61
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:59,840
the situation

62
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,680
pretty much was through a campaign to

63
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,200
to gut the indoor

64
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,159
growing industry

65
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,439
they targeted high times as well as the

66
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,520
the main

67
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:11,919
information vehicle that has been

68
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:14,000
spreading this this news

69
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:16,799
about growing

70
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,719
indoors and they wanted to snuff out the

71
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,599
industry and you know get rid of high

72
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:23,120
times at the same time if they could and

73
00:02:21,598 --> 00:02:24,959
they also targeted a magazine called

74
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,759
synomia tips

75
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,680
and targeting meant that they um they

76
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:31,919
started a grand jury

77
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,920
they

78
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:38,080
indicted um well they indicted the

79
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:39,119
president of a company called the seed

80
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,280
bank

81
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,560
out of that grand jury they

82
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,360
won information from high times

83
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:48,560
regarding a possible criminal conspiracy

84
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,920
you know connecting us with him and we

85
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,598
of course are connected in a business

86
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:52,878
relationship he advertises through high

87
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:55,199
times but they seem to think it's

88
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:56,639
something bigger and vaster than that

89
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:58,639
you know that we're you know in the

90
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:00,878
midst of you know some sort of you know

91
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:02,399
major clandestine activities to

92
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:04,318
distribute marijuana all over the world

93
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,640
or something it's just absurd you know

94
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:08,560
we're or a magazine that talks about it

95
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:10,318
well now with high times being

96
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,920
established is what many people say the

97
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:13,199
bible of the movement

98
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:15,039
i mean you were there before anybody

99
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:16,399
else was it seems like i mean you were

100
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:17,759
reporting

101
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,360
and covering stories that people

102
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:21,679
wouldn't pick up and cover

103
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,159
all right so with you being out there

104
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,560
and and bringing that information home

105
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:28,560
that makes you an easy target how do you

106
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,239
protect yourself now how do you go about

107
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,080
getting advertisers how do you go about

108
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,439
raising funds to keep the magazine going

109
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,440
well it's not fundraising you know we're

110
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:37,759
a magazine we uh we put a magazine

111
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:39,439
people buy it you know uh that's one

112
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:41,840
major source of revenue high times has

113
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:44,079
uh as as good sales

114
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,239
and we thank all our you know dedicated

115
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,599
loyal readers they

116
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,080
you know i times is hard to get

117
00:03:47,598 --> 00:03:51,439
sometimes people always tell us that um

118
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,959
all over the country you know we get

119
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:55,280
questions you know where do i where can

120
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,719
i get it where do i get it people drive

121
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,120
miles out of the way to get it it's

122
00:03:56,719 --> 00:04:01,120
amazing we're spirited by those stories

123
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,560
but but you know it's just yeah i'm told

124
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,519
that in some parts of america it's

125
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,878
illegal for them to have the magazines

126
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,280
that's the absurdity of it you know they

127
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:10,798
can be told that by somebody in some

128
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,479
locality and they'll believe it and then

129
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,480
we'll get these calls you know it's high

130
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:16,319
times out of business or hard times and

131
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:18,159
we constantly get you know not lately

132
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:19,918
but but we have in the past you know i

133
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,840
mean i can't remember one real recently

134
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:23,279
but but we just generally get that kind

135
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,879
of thing and it's just all this

136
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:27,439
disinformation that got spread around

137
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:30,000
about high times that the d a you know

138
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:31,680
our arch enemy you know uh you know

139
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,720
likes to constantly spread you know they

140
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,319
can just

141
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,240
send it out into the media it gets

142
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:38,399
picked up it gets spread around you know

143
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,918
in stories and water service stories

144
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:41,120
before you know it it's just sprinkled

145
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:42,879
into the

146
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,560
consciousness of people you know that so

147
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:47,839
and so you know has occurred you know

148
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,759
and and that's not true okay now when

149
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:52,159
i've traveled across seas i've been to

150
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:54,000
amsterdam and germany and i've been i've

151
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,639
been to lucky enough to be a few places

152
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,478
courtesy of the united states army but

153
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,360
i've had the chance to do that

154
00:04:58,478 --> 00:05:01,918
and

155
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,520
when i was across these i noticed

156
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:05,198
that your magazine is there your

157
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:06,639
magazines in amsterdam your magazines in

158
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,720
england your magazines in canada your

159
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,120
magazines all across the coast false not

160
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,440
in canada illegal encounters it's

161
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,560
illegal in canada but it can maybe

162
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:16,399
through mail order people are getting

163
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,399
right right so you are reaching an

164
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:20,560
international audience so therefore you

165
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:22,399
focus on the world scene

166
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,360
now there's been some changes in the

167
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:27,679
laws regarding hemp and there's been

168
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,199
some people and i think australia who

169
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,160
are trying to bring him

170
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,919
into a cash crop situation and to help

171
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,960
feed the people down there when you

172
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:36,799
focus in the world seeing what

173
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:38,319
directions do you go

174
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,240
i sterling i don't know very much better

175
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:43,599
than a proposal to the uh the government

176
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:46,000
there for uh uh and project uh

177
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,360
we focus on um a lot of the aspects of

178
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,199
where hemp comes from around the world

179
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,960
at this point we're unearthing it at the

180
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:53,360
same time all the activists are you know

181
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:54,799
we're all working at a feverish pace you

182
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,919
know the activists and the entrepreneurs

183
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,600
i must add uh you know there's money out

184
00:05:57,918 --> 00:06:02,478
there and people are trying to make it

185
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:05,039
as well as spread the gospel about you

186
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:07,199
know hemp you know so uh so you know

187
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:09,279
we're doing that you know as well

188
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,960
yeah and you're doing an excellent job

189
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:12,719
we'll be talking more with steve bloom

190
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:14,478
right after this

191
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,919
you're actively seeking new advertisers

192
00:06:14,478 --> 00:06:17,519
and you're also repositioning the

193
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:20,318
magazine and putting it into a different

194
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:22,159
direction isn't that right well the base

195
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,759
of advertisers the government's scared

196
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,240
off uh through the harassment of

197
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,919
operation green merchant uh

198
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,319
we have

199
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:32,318
we've had to look elsewhere uh and

200
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,879
fortunately as i said before the readers

201
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:37,840
have been able to sort of carry the load

202
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:39,759
and very devoted and keep us keep us

203
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:41,599
afloat but we need more advertising to

204
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:43,439
really you know run a

205
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,000
you know a better operation you know

206
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:47,439
overall and we've been just looking out

207
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,038
to you know

208
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:52,399
more obvious markets uh the

209
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:54,639
entertainment world uh record companies

210
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:56,560
film companies book companies they

211
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,800
are very reticent but you know that's

212
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,240
our little test each time we uh we make

213
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,038
a breakthrough

214
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,720
i don't know if i should show

215
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:04,560
advertising but this is

216
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,639
an advertisement uh from columbia

217
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,478
records who said that they would not

218
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:10,560
advertise in high times at one point we

219
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:12,719
were told because of our support of

220
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,079
normal okay somehow or other this group

221
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,599
persuaded them

222
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:17,279
to have the advertisement because they

223
00:07:15,598 --> 00:07:19,360
want it it's something some wall broke

224
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:21,439
down very quickly for some strange

225
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,800
reason and it's a good wall for us

226
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:23,918
and we're hoping it'll be more of that

227
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,038
just you know getting out in the

228
00:07:23,918 --> 00:07:27,519
community people have been afraid to

229
00:07:25,038 --> 00:07:29,360
touch us now over the years your your

230
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:30,399
content of your magazine has gotten

231
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,038
stronger

232
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:35,038
and it's become more focused and i

233
00:07:33,038 --> 00:07:37,199
believe you've even been responsible for

234
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:38,560
uh breaking news bringing new

235
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,160
information to light that kind of

236
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,918
rattles the trees

237
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,759
well we are you know our main claim to

238
00:07:41,918 --> 00:07:45,680
fame in recent history is the whole hemp

239
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:47,759
information that we've uncovered you

240
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,918
know uh we did a big story on jfk

241
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,840
recently that uh that is sort of

242
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:53,359
will be becoming a major motion picture

243
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:55,359
now it's yeah it's coming in the movies

244
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:58,400
coming out about jfk i mean that kind of

245
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,639
uh information uh you know we we jump on

246
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:02,560
the stuff that's not told you know and

247
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,079
uh that's where we see us as ourselves

248
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,240
as the alternative press at this point

249
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:07,680
because there's so many angles

250
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,038
sometimes maybe a little too heavy on

251
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,800
the conspiracy side we have to sort of

252
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:13,759
rules a few out you know in editorial

253
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:16,240
meetings but but you know the hemp uh uh

254
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,919
information is a grand conspiracy theory

255
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,840
you know when you really dig into it all

256
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:21,279
and uh and that's what's i think

257
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:22,560
ultimately really fascinated us that

258
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:24,079
it's so deep

259
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,319
and you've also been attributed or your

260
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:27,918
magazine has been attributed to help and

261
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,919
to bring the focus to the hampton

262
00:08:27,918 --> 00:08:31,519
movement like an umbrella where people

263
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:32,639
can all get to know each other and

264
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:35,199
interact

265
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:37,038
as you continue to grow how do you plan

266
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,560
to incorporate that that particular we

267
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:41,519
want them to start advertising that's

268
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:43,119
the other side uh i guess uh but they

269
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:45,759
know that i don't have to tell them

270
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,759
through this medium uh but uh we were

271
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:49,600
hoping to create a hemp industry in a

272
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:52,000
sense you know that will benefit us as

273
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,600
well uh i don't think that's mercenary

274
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,919
you know we you know we have to survive

275
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,200
and and just like the previous companies

276
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:58,719
who are no longer advertising well there

277
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,560
are a few you know the lighting systems

278
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,639
and stuff like that the growth the grow

279
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:05,439
companies so to speak garden you know

280
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:07,120
stores and so on they um you know they

281
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,320
have come back in drips and drabs but we

282
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,839
need to look elsewhere and there's a

283
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,160
whole hemp industry that's waiting to

284
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,839
sort of really blossom you see it here

285
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:15,679
in this building downstairs you know the

286
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,880
whole row of people with hemp them

287
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:18,159
merchants and

288
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:19,919
it's pretty amazing to watch you know

289
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:21,600
how it's how it is expanding and there

290
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:23,120
really is money in it i think and people

291
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,320
are going to make money from it too and

292
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,480
it'll be good it'll help fund the

293
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,839
movement and and get you know you know

294
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,200
we need more money here in this whole

295
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,560
movement and hopefully it'll get spread

296
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,839
around the right ways you know so it's

297
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:35,278
just not a few entrepreneurs you know

298
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,279
and when people think of high times

299
00:09:35,278 --> 00:09:39,278
magazine they think of it sometimes as

300
00:09:37,278 --> 00:09:40,879
strictly a marijuana magazine and

301
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:43,120
there's a lot more to it than that now

302
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:44,799
isn't there well you know we really are

303
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,200
the only marijuana magazine so we'll

304
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:48,958
still you know i don't mind that banner

305
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,360
kind of changing the terminology

306
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:53,838
somewhat to hemp or whatever but uh you

307
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,519
know within that i mean we voice of the

308
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,120
counter culture we have a little slogan

309
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:58,399
i mean many people ask well what's the

310
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,560
counter culture or is there a counter

311
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:02,958
culture you know and we think there is

312
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:04,399
you know we've uncovered that as well

313
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:05,919
you know people don't want to know about

314
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,360
hemptour they don't want to know there

315
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:08,719
are people all over the country that's a

316
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,399
counter culture

317
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,320
counter cultural movement of people

318
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:14,000
doing that and it just does it gets

319
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,760
local coverage but it doesn't get any

320
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,120
you know national you know it's not

321
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:19,200
reported like they'd rather report in

322
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,959
the new york times a few weeks ago that

323
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,240
there's a whole decline in marijuana use

324
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:23,599
and so on and so forth and they don't

325
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,320
want to acknowledge that there's a whole

326
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,320
rise in a movement of people who think

327
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,560
that you know it should be legalized and

328
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,000
you know that doesn't indicate decline

329
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:33,359
they don't want to recognize that you

330
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,039
know there is a counter culture of

331
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,560
people out there it's just not as usual

332
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:39,039
it was in the 60s it doesn't make as

333
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:40,559
good pictures crowds aren't big enough

334
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:42,559
for them or something but you're still

335
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:43,838
making a change in people's lives you've

336
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,518
occasionally

337
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,600
picked up the banner in somebody's world

338
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:50,399
who's been arrested or been treated

339
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,759
unjustly and with the power of the press

340
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,240
shall we say you've corrected an

341
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:55,838
injustice

342
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,799
we'd like to discuss a couple of those

343
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:00,399
stories when we come back after this

344
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:03,120

steve bloom steve as we said earlier uh

346
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,200
the power of the press can make a

347
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:09,120
difference in personal lives now you on

348
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,560
a personal example have shown by

349
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,839
personal example how that can be

350
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:12,799
achieved and some of the things that

351
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,680
you've done and then you've written

352
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:15,359
about it

353
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:19,278
yeah there was one situation where i was

354
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:21,200
arrested uh last year in new jersey and

355
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:23,360
it really put the drug war right in my

356
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,959
face you know we get so much information

357
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,039
to high times from people who are

358
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:28,319
arrested all the time but it's detached

359
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:29,759
you know from the reality of it

360
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,480
happening well what happened to me you

361
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:33,919
know

362
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:37,440
and what happened kind of uh in in brief

363
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:38,399
is i was driving uh at night uh new

364
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,680
jersey

365
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:41,519
uh

366
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:43,759
speeding and i was pulled over for a

367
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:46,159
speeding violation and that just wasn't

368
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:47,838
enough you know they i was driving a car

369
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:51,360
that uh that they

370
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:53,279
presumed guilty uh an old firebird 70s

371
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,560
kind of car if it's some sort of profile

372
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:55,919
i'm told

373
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:57,759
and i was just coming back from a dead

374
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:59,199
show so i kind of looked apart but you

375
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:00,799
know so once he sized me up you know

376
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,278
it's like we're getting this guy out of

377
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:04,799
the car and to be honest i had been

378
00:12:03,278 --> 00:12:07,278
stopped one other time in new jersey

379
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:09,278
within that year you know and so i was

380
00:12:07,278 --> 00:12:11,519
like oh no here we go again same damn

381
00:12:09,278 --> 00:12:12,799
car you know whatever uh and i hadn't

382
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,000
had the car very long either just

383
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:15,679
somebody you know just the way that

384
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,039
happened it's a great car but for some

385
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:20,399
reason they you know they hate it in new

386
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:22,399
jersey and uh and so they brought me out

387
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,679
of the car and proceeded to search and

388
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,120
since it happened in the previous time

389
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:26,319
as well i knew they were going to the

390
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,320
patch search

391
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,320
and they you know they pat you down

392
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,680
which really is a major violation right

393
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,440
there you know but they're allowed to do

394
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:34,719
this for some reason you know and first

395
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,680
of all why are they taking me out of the

396
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,278
car

397
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:38,958
that's the whole point i mean in my mind

398
00:12:37,278 --> 00:12:42,320
it's like why did he why did that even

399
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:43,919
stop start you know as as a necessity

400
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,600
that's the change in life from you know

401
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:46,958
my time when i was younger first

402
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,240
learning how to drive and maybe having a

403
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:49,919
speeding violation and you get your

404
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,399
ticket and that's it and you go to now

405
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:54,719
you know this whole hysterical response

406
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,639
to a simple traffic violation and even

407
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,240
if you get out of the car without being

408
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,600
told to they'll put a gun well then of

409
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,278
course it gets worse you know my story

410
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,480
is not as bad as you know a lot of

411
00:13:01,278 --> 00:13:05,200
others i'm sure you can hear but they

412
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:08,800
did uh they did take me out they found a

413
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:10,399
pipe in my pouch uh and uh and i was

414
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:12,879
arrested for the pipe simply for the

415
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:15,120
pipe no no quantity of anything other

416
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:16,879
than you know what was called less than

417
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,440
50 grams which they tested the pipe to

418
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:21,360

419
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,120
and but meanwhile i'm arrested

420

house the whole thing you know and uh

428
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:44,000
this is all for a pipe so uh i was let

429
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:45,759
out in about an hour you know it wasn't

430
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,360
the worst experience of my life i

431
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:49,120
suppose they didn't hit me they didn't

432
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,639
do anything you know they didn't beat me

433
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,078
nothing happened terrible like that it

434
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,440
was sort of a state of unreality when i

435
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:56,078
went back to my car and i just drove

436
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,519
home okay i just got arrested okay and

437
00:13:56,078 --> 00:13:58,719
i'm out of my own you know recognizance

438
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:01,120
and now i have to do the whole court

439
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:03,120
thing so i went to a lawyer and a friend

440
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,480
of mine who's a new jersey lawyer and

441
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,240
she decided to take the case she's a

442
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,839
corporate lawyer who really didn't have

443
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,240
the time to do it and so she's a real

444
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:12,320
great hero to me having

445
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,399
having taken this case pro bono

446
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:17,360
and did some research we found some

447
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:19,440
interesting precedents and used it to uh

448
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,879
to overturn the search okay and we lost

449
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,720
in the first round and we won in the

450
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:24,958
second round on this on the the state

451
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,320
level going to trenton

452
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:28,078
he had to get through one round because

453
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,480
it was a small town that just no way

454
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:32,000
they were gonna slap the cops wrists and

455
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,440
then we had to get out of that town and

456
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,679
go to the state house where they didn't

457
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:38,160
care about that little town's concerns

458
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:40,399
apparently or got a cool judge you know

459
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:42,159
you know they got the judge suite of uh

460
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:44,958
of uh trenton or something you know who

461
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:46,159
really you know heard our story and was

462
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:47,359
actually disappointed the state didn't

463
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:49,120
really try and defend themselves very

464
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,959
well they thought oh they'll just you

465
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:53,278
know and they they came with a real

466
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:55,039
uh lame approach to you know not even

467
00:14:53,278 --> 00:14:56,559
trying to like sell the you know that i

468
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:58,559
was really guilty of anything just yeah

469
00:14:56,559 --> 00:15:00,559
you know he did this to you um i didn't

470
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:02,319
do anything i moved my hand like this to

471
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:04,638
get my wallet to my pouch and he thought

472
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:06,639
i was going for a gun you know it's just

473
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:08,079
all this uh so you know from firsthand

474
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,759
experience yeah they they'll make up

475
00:15:08,078 --> 00:15:11,278
anything you know and and the hemptour

476
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:12,480
people have told me you know well and

477
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:13,919
i've learned you know you can't drive

478
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,199
around anymore with you know anything

479
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:16,639
wrong with your car that anything

480
00:15:15,198 --> 00:15:18,159
they'll pick you off you know that's the

481
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:20,240
police state stuff that we're dealing

482
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:21,919
with that's scary and and i think people

483
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,519
realize that on a day-to-day level an

484
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:25,360
average citizen now i think it's really

485
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:26,720
seeping and they realize i mean except

486
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,399
for the you know the hysterical people

487
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,959
who are in favor of the drug war who are

488
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:32,958
of the few but they bark loudest you

489
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:35,198
know you know we you know most people

490
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:36,638
still i think are opposed to that kind

491
00:15:35,198 --> 00:15:38,719
of encroachment on their freedoms i mean

492
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:41,198
the average american citizen you know so

493
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,800
when it comes out of drug-related uh

494
00:15:41,198 --> 00:15:44,240
behavior which people think is no big

495
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:45,679
deal in the first place you know i have

496
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,879
a lot of average americans and then they

497
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:48,479
they're getting stopped on top of it

498
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:50,320
they're getting really incensed

499
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,159
you know it's and it's costing money

500
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,079
obviously as well you know they're you

501
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:56,559
know it's cripping their whole you know

502
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:58,559
financial you know life it could be any

503
00:15:56,559 --> 00:16:00,559
number of things my case is such a small

504
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:02,239
little situation but it did teach me how

505
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:03,518
you have to fight back and what it costs

506
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,120
to fight back my lawyer said it would

507
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:06,560
have cost so much money and i realized i

508
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,919
probably wouldn't be able to afford it

509
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:10,078
right you know so the whole system is

510
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:12,078
not set up very well to fight back

511
00:16:10,078 --> 00:16:12,958
um we've only got about a minute or two

512
00:16:12,078 --> 00:16:14,399
left

513
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:16,239
and there's a

514
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:18,159
great number of journalists in america

515
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:21,198
who like to be able to have a forum i'm

516
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:23,360
sure as yours and be able to

517
00:16:21,198 --> 00:16:24,799
voice their opinion as you do but

518
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,720
the way the laws are written and the way

519
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:28,719
the harassment and various communities

520
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,560
are are presented to people they have a

521
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,160
tendency to withdraw from having the

522
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:33,758
courage to do that

523
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:36,078
what would you say to these journalists

524
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:38,159
now dealing with the rights that we have

525
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:40,399
in america how would you how would you

526
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:42,559
individually i mean uh and in their life

527
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:44,159
because we need journalists

528
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:46,078
well i i guess they must have problems

529
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:47,600
from from publication publication

530
00:16:46,078 --> 00:16:49,120
depending on the editorial slant you

531
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,680
know where do they want to go you know

532
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:53,278
with their editorial focus do they i'm

533
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:54,638
amazed you know the amount of say hemp

534
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:56,320
editorials you see all over the country

535
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:58,079
drug legalization editorials again you

536
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,320
see from you know real average you know

537
00:16:58,078 --> 00:17:03,039
the you know the main the daily papers

538
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,640
all across america it's not a word that

539
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:06,798
seems to be having a hard time getting

540
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,799
spread you know it's it is fanning out

541
00:17:06,798 --> 00:17:10,639
all over the place but but i'm sure it's

542
00:17:08,798 --> 00:17:11,679
a tough sell some places you probably

543
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,679
have to just

544
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,280
you know pitch it real hard you know

545
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,559
like like anybody else would you know

546
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:18,720
come at him and almost sort of a

547
00:17:16,558 --> 00:17:20,480
business like approach you know the

548
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,558
quality manuscript on something that

549
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,000
says your point of view you know you can

550
00:17:22,558 --> 00:17:25,359
probably get in his guest editorials i

551
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,679
don't know i don't think it's that hard

552
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:29,599
i mean we are somewhat of an island

553
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:31,038
right now in in in the world of

554
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:33,599
publishing you know we're doing

555
00:17:31,038 --> 00:17:35,440
something that nobody quite is doing and

556
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:37,279
you know sometimes that's that excites

557
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,200
us and other times we'd rather we'd

558
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:41,279
rather have a few more friends you know

559
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,038
like you understand what we're doing you

560
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:44,720
know we're really not bad guys i don't

561
00:17:43,038 --> 00:17:46,000
know why the publishing industry a lot

562
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,679
of times doesn't lend more support

563
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,279
towards what we do you know they just

564
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:50,640
we're like the the stepchild or

565
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:52,720
something and they want to just like

566
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,559
they want to watch from afar you know

567
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,160
you see how we are we're like the guinea

568
00:17:54,558 --> 00:17:57,678
pigs you know in this first amendment

569
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,480
experiment or something and it's like

570
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:01,840
let them deal with it and well we are

571
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,160
dealing with it we have a good lawyer

572
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:05,839
and we have the resources apparently to

573
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,880
to get as far as we've gone they haven't

574
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:09,599
sunk us

575
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,919
you know they would like to have can

576
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:13,678
they haven't and uh and everybody thinks

577
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:15,280
why don't they just come up and

578
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:16,720
bust us all or something you know it's

579
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:18,160
not that easy they've got nothing on

580
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,759
them it's nice

581
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,200

582
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:23,200
