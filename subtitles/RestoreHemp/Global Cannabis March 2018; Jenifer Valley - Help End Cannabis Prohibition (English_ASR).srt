1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,440
hi my name is Jennifer Valle they call

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:05,759
me stony girl and I might you ought to

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:09,150
know that I ran for county commissioner

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:12,929
ten years ago and I had an amazing time

5
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:14,910
I spent 50 bucks so that I could run

6
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:18,149
against my county commissioners because

7
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:22,560
they tried to ban cannabis in Clackamas

8
00:00:18,149 --> 00:00:24,750
County so I made him talk about cannabis

9
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:28,409
at every single candidate forum every

10
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:31,230
single candidate event and at the end I

11
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:33,238
won ten percent of the vote which was

12
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:36,149
more than two of the other candidates up

13
00:00:33,238 --> 00:00:38,878
there and here's the big difference I

14
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:42,960
only spent three hundred and fifty bucks

15
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:44,878
I paid 50 bucks for my filing fee at

16
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,058
three hundred dollars for my candidate

17
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:49,979
statement and that was it I'm the rest

18
00:00:48,058 --> 00:00:53,549
of them spent a quarter of a million

19
00:00:49,979 --> 00:00:56,488
dollars now if I can do that

20
00:00:53,549 --> 00:00:59,788
you can do it too and the important

21
00:00:56,488 --> 00:01:02,189
thing is all of our legislators need to

22
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:03,329
hear from us we need to be running at

23
00:01:02,189 --> 00:01:06,658
every level

24
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:10,079
state representative senator city

25
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:12,390
council county commissioner because it's

26
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:14,969
an opportunity for us to make our voice

27
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:18,329
heard in places where our story would

28
00:01:14,969 --> 00:01:20,789
never be told anywhere else I got to

29
00:01:18,329 --> 00:01:23,219
meet people at the old folks home and

30
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:26,368
tell them about how cannabis oil cured

31
00:01:23,219 --> 00:01:28,259
my stage four cancer I got to put it in

32
00:01:26,368 --> 00:01:31,409
my voters pamphlet and send the message

33
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:33,989
out to every voter in my County and I

34
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:37,049
would like everyone to consider running

35
00:01:33,989 --> 00:01:39,209
for office at least once don't even

36
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:42,060
worry about whether you win or not just

37
00:01:39,209 --> 00:01:45,059
know that running to argue is so much

38
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:47,780
fun anyway thank you all have a great

39
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:51,920
day we need to make it possible for

40
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:51,920
marijuana to be legal everywhere else
