1
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,359
there's me

2
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,879
there's the other me there's another

3
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:20,480
being

4
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:23,518
and then there are the mormys

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:27,278
we've all got a domino to play

6
00:00:23,518 --> 00:00:30,559
so we been trying to work it out

7
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:33,119
we don't know how your life went or what

8
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:36,960
all that means

9
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:41,280
but me and the bees we're not going back

10
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,280
we already see what we couldn't do

11
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:51,440
and his skeletons in our closets

12
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:51,439
are our own private stash of bones

13
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,120
there's no screening like the next

14
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,160
screen

15
00:00:55,119 --> 00:01:02,320
reducing the past the present

16
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:04,878
into nothing while eternity is now

17
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,879
not then

18
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:09,920
who's divided into what

19
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:13,839
and what does that mean

20
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:18,319
there's love that loves

21
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,478
there's love that fears there's love

22
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:24,959
that possesses

23
00:01:22,478 --> 00:01:25,840
there's love that needs proof where's

24
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:30,319
the love

25
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,320
that likes love that cares

26
00:01:32,078 --> 00:01:36,239
there's no forgetting some reality's

27
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:39,280
destiny threw at us

28
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:41,839
and fate wasn't much help for this way

29
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,359
of loading the load and we didn't have

30
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:55,840
any say

31
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:55,840
but it was up to us

32
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,840
so

33
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:26,400
in the land where the lie is king

34
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:30,080
pretending pretending isn't pretending

35
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,080
using fear like glue

36
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:41,440
at least one of the me have seen it all

37
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:45,840
each and every one of us wants the glory

38
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:48,560
but not one of us likes the way we fall

39
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,280
astray for the way of walking when

40
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,159
staying

41
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,039
isn't an option because we've been

42
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:56,479
accused

43
00:02:53,039 --> 00:03:01,199
of some things we did and didn't do

44
00:02:56,479 --> 00:03:01,199
and we heard i forgive yous that lie

45
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:09,039
vietnamese are looking for me

46
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:19,840
they will answer to me so far

47
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:19,840
there's no one who will

48
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,840
do

49
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,920
you
