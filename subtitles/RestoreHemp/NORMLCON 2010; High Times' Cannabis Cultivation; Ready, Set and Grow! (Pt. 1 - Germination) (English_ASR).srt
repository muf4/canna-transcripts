1
00:00:00,919 --> 00:00:06,599
welcome everybody to the uh Ready Set

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:09,080
grow uh breakout session here it gives

3
00:00:06,599 --> 00:00:11,320
me great pleasure to have put this thing

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:13,679
together and I don't think even just a

5
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:17,240
couple of years ago this would even be a

6
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:21,039
possibility um to have people speaking

7
00:00:17,239 --> 00:00:23,000
about uh growing for patients um the

8
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:25,359
right ways to do it the safest ways to

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,679
do it uh and people that are willing to

10
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:29,320
come out and talk about that uh and how

11
00:00:27,678 --> 00:00:33,600
they how they're able to do that you

12

13
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,399

introduce the panel here uh directly to

15
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:44,719
my left Miss Jill from uh TGA genetics

16
00:00:41,878 --> 00:00:47,280
TGA seeds is Team Green Avenger

17
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:50,520

and gals that are helping out uh for the

20
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:57,558
medical patients uh they're seed

21
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:59,160
breeders they're Growers and uh you know

22

they really do it the right way they're

23
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:04,920
responsible for uh some really amazing

24
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:07,959
strains like Vortex uh Jil beam Jack the

25
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:10,400
Ripper Danny Boy and uh the list really

26
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:13,798

an amazing book uh Inside the Mind of a

33
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:34,478
breeder and and what choice they make uh

34
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:36,640
to create the strains that they make and

35
00:01:34,478 --> 00:01:40,679
uh beautiful pictures as

36
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:44,718
well okay uh we got Rafael Martinez uh

37
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:49,159
Jr who is a patient caregiver uh for the

38
00:01:44,718 --> 00:01:51,640
state of Oregon and a major player with

39
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:57,000
work and normal and a great

40
00:01:51,640 --> 00:02:00,478
dude I'm scy here uh that's rapael or

41
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Junior and then eor ruz old friend of

42
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:03,759
mine he's taking the place of Kyle

43
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,080
kushman who actually sadly could not

44
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:10,840
make it uh up here for this uh seminar

45
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,319
but uh he is taking the place he's with

46
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:15,680
uh Safe Harbor of Maine which is one of

47
00:02:13,318 --> 00:02:18,399
the first dispensaries uh on the east

48
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,239
coast in Maine uh they only allowed

49
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,560
eight dispensaries for the whole state

50
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:26,319
and I think it's one one per

51
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:29,080
resident no it's one per County it's one

52
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:30,719
per County and uh they already have the

53
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:33,440
caregivers they had the medical law

54
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:34,919
since 99 uh they have a grow your own

55
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:37,239
they have a caregiver system and now

56
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:38,799
they're going to have dispensaries uh

57
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:42,120
even some of them I think will be able

58
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:44,200
to deliver the medicine to patients in

59
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,759
their homes which is really exciting for

60
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:47,719
us on the east coast and Main's really

61
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:50,598
leaving the way it's like the California

62
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:54,349
of uh of our side

63
00:02:50,598 --> 00:02:55,679
of the country and that's so that's

64
00:02:54,349 --> 00:02:59,400
[Music]

65
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:02,159
Igor uh and to his left uh Jeremy Miller

66
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:04,680
Jeremy is not only the founder of uh

67
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:08,639
Olympia Hempfest in Washington he's also

68
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:11,519
a great grower and uh uh the breeder of

69
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:16,399
seeds of Truth uh which is his uh you

70
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:18,280
know medical marijuana seed uh outfit so

71
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,039
uh and if I've never been to Ali

72
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,360
Hempfest but I hear it's a great time

73
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:24,479
and I'm looking forward to hopefully

74
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:27,760
coming this uh next year so welcome

75
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:29,878
Jeremy uh let's get right to it uh we

76
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:32,719
only have a little under a couple hours

77
00:03:29,878 --> 00:03:35,878
or whatever so uh I want to get as much

78
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:37,239
as we can out of uh everybody so I guess

79
00:03:35,878 --> 00:03:40,959
we'll start at the beginning you know

80
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:42,400
germinating seeds is really how you uh

81
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:45,959
Embark upon

82
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,480
this uh Pursuit you know because you can

83
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:48,840
always buy clones from the dispensary

84
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:50,598
and that's a good way also to get

85
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,479
started sometimes but you could you

86
00:03:50,598 --> 00:03:55,039
could come with a lot of problems and it

87
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:56,399
depends on who you get them from um a

88
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:59,039
lot of them can be susceptible to

89
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,239
powdery Milo or already have pests on

90
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:03,078
them and you know a lot of times they're

91
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:06,438
just not they don't have the Vigor that

92
00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:08,920
you get when you pop seeds and uh so I

93
00:04:06,438 --> 00:04:11,318
think uh I'm going to talk to sub cool

94
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:13,318
right now let him uh let him tell us

95
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:16,798
about germinating

96
00:04:13,318 --> 00:04:19,959
seeds thank you Danny um there's milons

97
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:22,599
of ways to start seeds um we see a lot

98
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:25,399
of seeds start we have 20 strains

99
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:27,040
worldwide distribution so I see

100
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:29,198
everything you can possibly see with

101
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,840
seeds and the first thing I would say is

102
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:33,720
that people try to do too much to them

103
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:35,918
uh my favorite picture is uh we sort

104
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:38,639
seeds out back and underneath my

105
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:41,918
barbecue grill and working when it's 40Â°

106
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:44,079
and granite seeds will germinate okay so

107
00:04:41,918 --> 00:04:46,519
it doesn't take anything to germinate

108
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:48,159
seeds uh a lot of times people will send

109
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:50,279
me an email that says hey I got your

110
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:53,919
seeds they didn't germinate I put them

111
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:55,719
on a heat mat I used this and that three

112
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:58,399
drops of this you know nature didn't

113
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:01,120
really need all that um we are big fans

114
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:02,478
of a product called rapid roters uh I

115
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,240
don't know which company makes them

116
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:07,719
they're a small cord plug we flip them

117
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:09,160
upside down we stick the seat in and

118
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:12,240
they germinate I mean that's that's

119
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:14,759
really what it's about uh I really try

120
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,759
to suggest that people not use a lot of

121
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:19,680
chemicals and products in order to Aid

122
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:23,160
germination because it simply is not

123
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:25,280
required um and that's really how I

124
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:27,400
germinate seeds and and have for a long

125
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:29,038
time one more small point a lot of

126
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:32,560
people like to put them in paper towel

127
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:34,240
last zipl bag that's fine but if you

128
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,160
don't have a light touch as you're

129
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,720
transferring the seeds from the plastic

130
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,840
bag and the paper towel you can tear the

131
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:43,440
seeds up you know you can smash them or

132
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:45,399
Nick them with your tweezers so I don't

133
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:47,439
think that's always the best way if

134
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:49,599
you're a big clumsy guy like me and your

135
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:52,439
hands aren't real delicate so you know

136
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,080
don't try to start moving seeds around

137
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:56,519
while you got resin all over them the

138
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:59,959
stuff you'll kill your

139
00:05:56,519 --> 00:06:06,478
seeds all right and uh um Rafael do you

140
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:06,478
have any uh any seed germination tips or

141
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:13,478
anything you know you know I I kind of

142
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:15,680
have the same Theory as sub I don't

143
00:06:13,478 --> 00:06:17,879
really believe in using a lot of um

144
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:21,120
chemicals when you do it on the old

145
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:24,560
clumsy hands I still use I still use the

146
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:26,280
seat bag you know and the paper towel

147
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,199
but I'm old school you know the guy I

148
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:30,799
learned from is older than dirt you know

149
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:32,680
my dad so he's taught me quite a few

150
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:36,439
things that I've learned and he's a seed

151
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:39,319
person with the in paper towel paper

152
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:42,038
towel but no most Comm water that's the

153
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:44,240
most common way that's pretty much me

154
00:06:42,038 --> 00:06:46,519
all right and uh so what what's the

155
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,400
importance of of growing from seeds and

156
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:50,478
and and and and explain what a mother

157
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:53,439
plant is to people too I mean you don't

158
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:55,598
always have to grow from a seed only to

159
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:58,279
like just flower that plant and move on

160
00:06:55,598 --> 00:07:00,038
you can keep those genetics and that's I

161
00:06:58,279 --> 00:07:01,839
I try to go fast cuz I ran I'll try to

162
00:07:00,038 --> 00:07:03,360
stick to point here I covered this down

163
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:06,198
in Colorado everybody's very interested

164
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,759
in it the problem with clones are

165
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:10,079
threefold number one is Mis labeling I I

166
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:12,560
I love it when someone walks up and

167
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:14,120
hands me a bud and they tell me it's

168
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,759
California Orange well I've been growing

169
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:17,759
californ orange for three decades and I

170
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:19,400
know what it tastes like so the Clones

171
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,280
were very mislabeled and that can be a

172
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:23,239
problem if you're trying to make

173
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:26,839
tinctures or medical number two is Milo

174
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:28,319
that you cannot see mildew uh my partner

175
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:31,519
out there just got a bunch of nice

176
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:34,240
clones uh hell OG cut these are cuts

177
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:35,560
that people tro and salivate over and

178
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,879
what happened was even with good

179
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:40,759
treatment amazing mythology methology he

180
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:41,879
uh he got a little spot of powy mildew

181
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:44,360
and then he spent the next six months

182
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:45,840
getting rid of it so if you take clones

183
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,840
in thinking that you're going to save

184
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:48,878
time it's a very good possibility that

185
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:51,359
you're going to bring something into

186
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:54,599
your grow room the main thing that we

187
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:57,639
all are scared of M mites are part of

188
00:07:54,598 --> 00:07:59,079
growing cannabis indoors and out uh if

189
00:07:57,639 --> 00:08:02,400
you have a good climate in your grow

190
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:04,359
room keep it 74Â° all the time don't let

191
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:07,839
your temperature swing you can keep the

192
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:09,479
MS down but if you bring say rulin

193
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:11,119
cutting into your house a year ago

194
00:08:09,478 --> 00:08:13,359
because it is an amazing strain and you

195
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:16,319
really needed it to make a strain and

196
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,919
then you battle mes for a [Â __Â ] year

197
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:20,680
you know that's what you're opening

198
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:22,799
yourself up to when you start with seed

199
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:25,598
you don't have to worry about mites or

200
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:29,000
mildew or mole coming into your grow as

201
00:08:25,598 --> 00:08:30,800
a grower from a 10 pack of of good seeds

202
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,399
you should be able to select three to

203
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:37,120
four nice females discarding the females

204
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:39,360
that are not nice or not what you want

205
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,679
and select a mother plant that you want

206
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:44,919
now this is how we do it quickly we grow

207
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:47,719
the plant at day 45 we know that what

208
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:50,599
the sex of the plant is she takes clones

209
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:52,839
she has nice delicate hands um then we

210
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:54,879
Bud the plant out we smoke the plant we

211
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:56,640
share the plant with our patients we're

212
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:58,439
very lucky here in Oregon that we just

213
00:08:56,639 --> 00:09:01,240
give our pot to our patients we don't

214
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:03,200
charge for it so we give B away to

215
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:05,720
everybody you know we don't care who

216
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:08,360
find

217
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:10,160
joint there joints in the ashtray not

218
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,480
enough people smoking them because

219
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:14,399
they're not used to being here in orgon

220
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:17,320
anal guess um but okay so then we Bud

221
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:20,000
these plants out and she uses numbers I

222
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:22,160
like to use cool names this is Shaggy

223
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,120
this is one of our new space Queens uh

224
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:27,799
uh she squits oh I'm sorry so this is on

225
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:30,879
the cover of a magazine right now we

226
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:33,199
planted five seeds uh one of the seeds

227
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:34,759
her hermite right at five weeks it was

228
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,360
easy to get out of there people don't

229
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:40,399
want to talk about this but the dominant

230
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:42,440
state of cannabis is Herod ISM so as a

231
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:44,559
grower you just got to get rid of that

232
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:47,120
then we had two other ones one was

233
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:49,879
cheese dominant one was purple dominant

234
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:52,639
we selected this Peno which I Nam Shaggy

235
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:55,120
cuz I like cartoons and uh it's freaking

236
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:57,159
awesome I mean it tastes like grapes and

237
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:00,480
it tastes like cheese and it yielded 3

238
00:09:57,159 --> 00:10:03,078
and2 o from dirt from one Single Seed

239
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:06,240
grown in soil and this is a special

240
00:10:03,078 --> 00:10:08,319
phenotype that we won't get rid of right

241
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,959
it's got an amazing high and we found

242
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,200
this you can't do that if you don't

243
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:14,078
start the seeds so what I've done my

244
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,879
entire life and I urge you to do this if

245
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:17,838
you guys are out there growing Medic One

246
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:20,200
start seeds man it's like a box of

247
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:21,959
crackers Jacks and I I'm a seed guy

248
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:24,120
right but I'm not saying bu my seeds

249
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:26,359
okay there's there's plenty of breeders

250
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:28,600
out there right I mean I we grow other

251
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:31,240
people's seeds all the time looking for

252
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:33,480
something I grew DJ shorts blueberry I

253
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:36,440
didn't find what I wanted I grew this

254
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:38,959
kid from the UK seeds called a pine

255
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:40,639
Queen this kid's name is Sonic something

256
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:43,518
called Shima

257
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:45,320
times uh something else oh my God it's

258
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:48,639
like the third best pot i've smoked in

259
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:50,879
my life and so you can't find these

260
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:53,120
things if you don't start the seed so

261
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:56,000
I'm sorry it's so yeah absolutely and

262
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:58,879
from those seeds uh you can get a good

263
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,000
mother plant and from the mother plant

264
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:02,759
you get you can get an infinite amount

265
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,120
of clones I mean I wouldn't call it

266
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:07,078
infinite but I'd like to cover one more

267
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,240
small thing here um a lot of people

268
00:11:07,078 --> 00:11:11,679
don't understand cloning and I really

269
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:13,560
feel it important to address this you

270
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:15,120
don't have to keep a mother plant and

271
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:17,199
here in Oregon where we can grow six

272
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,399
plants for each one of our patients I

273
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:24,079
can't have a room full of 5 foot pot

274
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:27,559
plants I just can't we take clones just

275
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:30,919
before we bud so I have 12 strains in my

276
00:11:27,559 --> 00:11:33,439
grow room I take four clones a pretty

277
00:11:30,919 --> 00:11:35,278
nice clone the roost the fastest we keep

278
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,480
um Jack's cleaner I don't know how many

279
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:39,120
people have heard of Jack's cleaner it's

280
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:42,839
the father of Jack the Ripper uh it has

281
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:45,039
been cloned for two decades I mean I've

282
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:47,079
been to prison so while I was in prison

283
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:49,639
other people kept cloning it and it came

284
00:11:47,078 --> 00:11:51,519
back to me the plan is exactly the same

285
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:54,360
and this is what I want to explain I

286
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:57,799
think the word clone is wrong it's not

287
00:11:54,360 --> 00:12:01,480
we're not making a copy of something it

288
00:11:57,799 --> 00:12:04,958
is the plant we're taking a living piece

289
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:07,399
of the plant living piece of DNA and

290
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:09,278
then it's just growing again I'm not

291
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:11,480
going to stop calling them clones but

292
00:12:09,278 --> 00:12:13,919
you're not replicating something so the

293
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:16,000
theory of copy versus a copy versus a

294
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:18,240
copy it's

295
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,278
false you're right you want Healthy

296
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,720
Growth you want really Healthy Growth

297
00:12:20,278 --> 00:12:24,439
really good point you can't use a sick

298
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:26,160
clone but I would imagine most of us

299
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:27,600
growing here are not using big mother

300
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:32,480
rooms

301
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:34,720
right well uh yeah no it's great and uh

302
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,800
how about Jeremy uh why don't you tell

303
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:39,800
us a little bit about uh the situation

304
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:42,479
in Washington and uh also if you have

305
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:44,679
any tips on germinating seeds cloning or

306
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:48,039
mother

307
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:49,719
plants I uh I'm I'm very simplistic in

308
00:12:48,039 --> 00:12:52,639
the way I gerate seed so I I think the

309
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:55,320
way that subol said was very adequate

310
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:56,839
you definitely seeds have bigger that

311
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:59,240
clones don't have so I mean if you're

312
00:12:56,839 --> 00:13:01,040
starting from seed they take right off

313
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:03,839
really big so if you're starting in

314
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:05,319
water rapid R like subit suggested you

315
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,839
see those things just sprout right out

316
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:10,600
and take off like very vigorously

317
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:12,560
because the seeds have a just a vigorous

318
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:15,159
hybrid growth that the Clones don't

319
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:16,679
after a certain certain time they start

320
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:18,399
to lose a little bit they're still great

321
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:20,958
plants you won't see them quite as

322
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:24,440
vigorous as the seed stre in my

323
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:25,919
opinion um Washington State itself is a

324
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:28,880
little bit different it's Unique we're

325
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:32,879
able to grow 15 plants we're only able

326
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:34,759
to caregive for one patient so and um

327
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:37,958
the problem that we see with that is uh

328
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:39,799
Washington State um possession is 9/10

329
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:41,838
of the law so if I'm caregiving for

330
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:43,159
another patient then technically I'm in

331
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:45,839
possession of 30

332
00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:49,120
months so even though the law allows me

333
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:50,839
to grow for another patient I still am

334
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,639
fighting it in court I have to prove

335
00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:54,519
that I wasn't technically in possession

336
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:56,240
I was growing these for somebody else

337
00:13:54,519 --> 00:13:59,560
and I wasn't consuming that medicine on

338
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:01,399
my own uh behalf so it's kind of it's

339
00:13:59,559 --> 00:14:03,799
kind of strange Dynamics they're working

340
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:05,320
on a dispensary law next year Senator

341
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:08,639
Cole wals is working on a dispensary law

342
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:10,720
in Washington state um there's a lot of

343
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:13,079
aspects to this this proposed

344
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:15,360
legislation that really worry me I'm

345
00:14:13,078 --> 00:14:18,039
asking a lot of people to kind of take a

346
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:20,360
look at what's going on and uh this is

347
00:14:18,039 --> 00:14:21,639
our chance to really uh Define what's

348
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,120
going to happen here in the future in

349
00:14:21,639 --> 00:14:25,120
Washington and I think that the

350
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,159
legislators don't take into account what

351
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,799
the stakeholders and the patients you

352
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:29,759
know really feel a lot of times they

353
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:31,479
just

354
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:34,079
make time for the big lobbyist for the

355
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:35,360
people that have money and uh I think

356
00:14:34,078 --> 00:14:37,758
right in the next few years we're going

357
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,839
to see a lot of interesting backs in

358
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:41,959
Washington state for

359
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:43,920
sure yeah it sounds like it's turning

360
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:46,638
around very quickly and people are

361
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:47,799
getting more involved there's uh I mean

362
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:49,839
right now there's a lot of patient

363
00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:51,278
co-ops that are operating in Washington

364
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:54,560
state there's a lot that's popped up in

365
00:14:51,278 --> 00:14:56,519
Seattle this Spokane area I actually um

366
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:57,758
run one Tacoma area called Sac PL

367
00:14:56,519 --> 00:15:01,360
medicine that's where we do all her

368
00:14:57,759 --> 00:15:03,800
breeding everything for seeds of

369
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:06,879
true now what about uh we were talking

370
00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:11,639
about the importance of seeds and uh

371
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:14,078
Vigor um what about uh you know

372
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:16,519
germination what's what uh what's any

373
00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:18,679
any tips that you might have no I'm a

374
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:21,198
very simplistic germinator too I'll go

375
00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:22,958
either with a paper to old school style

376
00:15:21,198 --> 00:15:26,879
or I'll start them right in the

377
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:28,359
r two ways that I'll do it um mostly

378
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:30,198
I'll do it the old school paper towel

379
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,519
way because have time I don't have the r

380
00:15:30,198 --> 00:15:33,559
be right there in front of and what

381
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:36,440
about cloning do you do a lot of cloning

382
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:37,919
or most we do do uh a lot of cloning of

383
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:40,040
the strains that we have to keep them

384
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:42,559
perpetuated you know um but we

385
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:44,799
definitely love love the seeds you know

386
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:47,399
they have a bigger that clone just don't

387
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:51,240
have and they come like a subset disease

388
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:54,240
fruit so all right well uh as subset

389
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:56,839
also uh Jill takes the uh the

390
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,799
Clones uh for them or the cuting rooted

391
00:15:56,839 --> 00:16:01,519
cuting however you would want to refer

392
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:04,758
um uh so maybe you can give us a couple

393
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:07,440
of uh just step by step of how you how

394
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:09,800
you go about creating

395
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:14,399
clones well it's important that we start

396
00:16:09,799 --> 00:16:17,159
out with utensils we have um sorry we

397
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:20,519
have sharp razor blades

398
00:16:17,159 --> 00:16:23,399
and to take the and we take them at a

399
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:23,399
45Â°

400
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:30,600
angle Che

401
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:36,638
and we dip these in rooting hormone you

402
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:39,800
can use gel powder or liquid and we

403
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:42,680
prefer the liquid and I like to take the

404
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:44,599
the soft cuting and um usually off

405
00:16:42,679 --> 00:16:47,000
towards the bottom they need to be

406
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:49,720
healthy nice green coloring and I like

407
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,919
to make sure that there is a um a root

408
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:54,319
bump that will be going into the the

409
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:57,278
cube so that I feel that that's a better

410
00:16:54,318 --> 00:16:59,360
way to root the plant and we like to put

411
00:16:57,278 --> 00:17:02,600
those immediately under fluorescent we

412
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,480
put them in we use a shoe box plastic

413
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:06,558
shoe

414
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:08,919
box you can buy them at the Dollar Tree

415
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:10,519
and we take two sides and we invert them

416
00:17:08,919 --> 00:17:12,319
take the lids off and throw them away we

417
00:17:10,519 --> 00:17:14,480
just take two big sides and turn them

418
00:17:12,318 --> 00:17:16,759
inside you know together we stick them

419
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:19,240
under the light we keep the Clones very

420
00:17:16,759 --> 00:17:20,798
damp we keep them you know warm we don't

421
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:24,400
want them to get too hot we keep them

422
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:27,519
about 78Â° it's a good temperature and in

423
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:29,559
about 3 to 7 days we have

424
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:32,038
Roots next

425
00:17:29,558 --> 00:17:34,960
yeah that's great um the importance

426
00:17:32,038 --> 00:17:37,798
being on the humidity and the warmth um

427
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:39,720
and consistency and consistency but if

428
00:17:37,798 --> 00:17:42,639
you need to if it's cold and you're

429
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:45,279
doing a cloning uh get a cheap little

430
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,520
heat mat that you plug in and put that

431
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:49,079
underneath the tray it's really

432
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:50,519
important that the roots in that area

433
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:54,000
and the water that they sit in or

434
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:54,000
whatever it is never get too

435
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,599
cold this is this is going to sound

436
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:00,400
silly okay but I answer a lot of

437
00:17:58,599 --> 00:18:02,038
questions question and the main thing

438
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,440
that I ask everybody that have a problem

439
00:18:02,038 --> 00:18:06,119
with clones is do you own a thermometer

440
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:09,279
and you know I say what's the

441
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:12,359
temperature oh it's about no you have to

442
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:14,200
have a thermometer a feter is not the

443
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:16,319
way to Delta temperature and it sounds

444
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,519
silly telling you guys this but I can't

445
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:19,359
tell you the number of people that have

446
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:20,798
had problems for a month cloning I'm

447
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:22,240
trying to coach them through it they go

448
00:18:20,798 --> 00:18:24,599
to Radio Shack and all of a sudden

449
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,919
they've got clones so you got to have a

450
00:18:24,599 --> 00:18:28,439
thermometer and a humidistat to find out

451
00:18:26,919 --> 00:18:30,320
what the temperature in the humidistat

452
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:34,558
is don't just say Well they're kind of

453
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:36,879
warm that's not all right uh eor uh you

454
00:18:34,558 --> 00:18:40,599
got any any cloning

455
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:42,360
tips um well the rapid roter system

456
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:47,240
rapid roers everybody seems to be a fan

457
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:49,519
of that do you preo them um I I like

458
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:51,720
them because they're actually inoculated

459
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:53,798
in a lot of beneficial bacteria so it's

460
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:57,120
not going to get pollinated with stuff

461
00:18:53,798 --> 00:19:01,599
that's going to hurt your plant um

462
00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:04,599
that's not being yeah closer to M uh he

463
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:07,439
said so yeah what I said was the the

464
00:19:04,599 --> 00:19:09,079
sponges are inoculated with bacteria

465
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,000
they actually also have a little bit of

466
00:19:09,079 --> 00:19:13,879
a mineral charge too to help the plant

467
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,440
move forward there's other products on

468
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:19,039
the market as well such as easy roots

469
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:21,960
that cost a little bit less and it's

470
00:19:19,038 --> 00:19:24,079
really similar it's also pH bucks so if

471
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:26,440
your nutrient solution isn't exactly

472
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:29,038
right on it'll balance it itself out you

473
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:31,960
could also um it also make sure that

474
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:35,359
none of uh the well that the medium you

475
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:37,759
can't oversaturate it it'll uh you could

476
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:39,959
pour tons of water on it and if the

477
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:43,599
surrounding surface will float it'll

478
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:45,279
just lift itself up off the water and

479
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:48,399
balance itself up I would do a

480
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:50,240
commercial for rabbit RS they they Rock

481
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,960
they're so much nicer than anything we

482
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:55,440
ever had and and you know we would also

483
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:58,120
probably all agreed to try to discourage

484
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,440
the use of rock wool in that in that

485
00:19:58,119 --> 00:20:03,158
process I

486
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:06,759
mean plants do root well in rock wol uh

487
00:20:03,159 --> 00:20:08,480
because it's able to hold air and and

488
00:20:06,759 --> 00:20:10,119
allow oxygen to the roots and stuff but

489
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,839
it's a really kind of a toxic product

490
00:20:10,119 --> 00:20:14,879
not kind of a it's a toxic product and

491
00:20:12,839 --> 00:20:16,038
uh it's not good for you to be around it

492
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:19,200
and it's not good for you to throw it

493
00:20:16,038 --> 00:20:21,200
out and uh so rapid rooters or easy

494
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,400
roots or any kind of organic alternative

495
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,640
you can find are much better and the

496
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:29,159
truth is you can just get the the you

497
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:31,480
know little cubs and fill them with soil

498
00:20:29,159 --> 00:20:34,400
and keep it moist and warm and the plant

499
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:37,798
will root in that as well the the

500
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:39,679
moisture level and the warm temperature

501
00:20:37,798 --> 00:20:42,759
are what's important for to get the

502
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:46,759
roots to pop and once they pop now

503
00:20:42,759 --> 00:20:46,759
you're in the vegetative stage
