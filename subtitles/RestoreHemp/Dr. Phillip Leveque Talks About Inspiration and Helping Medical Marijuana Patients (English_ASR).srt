1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:14,000
when I was about 12 years old I decided

2
00:00:06,929 --> 00:00:17,969
that I wanted to be a a forensic chemist

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,490
and a forensic chemist has turned out to

4
00:00:17,969 --> 00:00:23,698
be a toxicologist but it wasn't called

5
00:00:20,489 --> 00:00:28,198
that at that time they were my my

6
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:30,300
training professor was the Oregon State

7
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:33,179
chemist for many many years and he

8
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:37,620
treated me as a toxicologist and then

9
00:00:33,179 --> 00:00:40,979
when I got to medical school I became a

10
00:00:37,619 --> 00:00:42,628
PhD of pharmacology and toxicology and

11
00:00:40,979 --> 00:00:44,578
you taught pharmacology and toxicology

12
00:00:42,628 --> 00:00:46,339
the number of medicals I taught

13
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:50,250
physiology pharmacology and toxicology

14
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:56,370
for about ten medical schools I was

15
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:58,948
invited to to East Africa Uganda and

16
00:00:56,369 --> 00:01:03,030
Tanzania where I trained the first

17
00:00:58,948 --> 00:01:08,579
doctors in Tanzania uh-huh University of

18
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:10,739
Georgia I was I was I was recruited by

19
00:01:08,579 --> 00:01:13,829
the University of London to teach in

20
00:01:10,739 --> 00:01:20,149
Africa and and so just like I say I

21
00:01:13,829 --> 00:01:24,209
trained the first doctors there and I

22
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:28,320
was a I was a medical school professor

23
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:30,000

24
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:32,179
a full-time student while I was a

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,239
full-time professor and that was at the

26
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:39,360
doc osteopathic college in Des Moines

27
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:42,899
Iowa and the strange thing about it was

28
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:46,590
that I got my osteopathic degree when I

29
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:49,920
was 50 54 years old and I was older than

30
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:52,549
most of the teachers that's when he

31
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:56,969
started being an individual practicing

32

raised my hand and I said thank you

67
00:03:22,889 --> 00:03:25,919
everybody around you thought you were

68
00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:29,129
about to launch into something about how

69
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:32,099
terrible marijuana and I says marijuana

70
00:03:29,129 --> 00:03:40,859
has been used for 5000 years as medicine

71
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:42,900
and it has never killed it I noted it

72
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:45,030
and I as soon as that show was over I

73
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:48,870
came to advise you to co-host this show

74
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:53,939
we started this show in 1996 in late

75
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:56,219
1996 and then you came on at about show

76
00:03:53,939 --> 00:03:57,959
number 75 or aged something like that

77
00:03:56,219 --> 00:04:01,289
yeah and we have some clips of some of

78
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:03,360
these earlier shows Paul moaning yeah

79
00:04:01,289 --> 00:04:06,750
you had Paul Loney on as a guest host

80
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,700
and he stayed on to about show 125 or so

81
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:10,829
yeah then when we switched over from

82
00:04:08,699 --> 00:04:13,439
this private studio that Lanny Swerdlow

83
00:04:10,829 --> 00:04:17,069
had started the first dozen the first

84
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:19,439
120 shows you moved over to when we

85
00:04:17,069 --> 00:04:21,180
started record shows here as well right

86
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:25,560
and you stayed at it for quite a while

87
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:26,910
well the first the first applications

88
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:29,189
that I wrote were in

89
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:32,130
your homes yeah for about three

90
00:04:29,189 --> 00:04:33,660
different homes yeah yeah and home what

91
00:04:32,129 --> 00:04:36,060
happened is if people start coming to

92
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:39,210
the TV show before the show to get you

93
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:41,220
to sign their papers and it's hard to be

94
00:04:39,209 --> 00:04:43,379
overwhelming in terms of the people

95
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:45,150
coming just before the show and I so he

96
00:04:43,379 --> 00:04:48,389
decided to move it over to my home for a

97
00:04:45,149 --> 00:04:50,699
while that became I I had my kids were

98
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:53,610
young then they're they're young adults

99
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:55,949
now but they I roll around on the floor

100
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:59,449
and pick up all the food scraps toys and

101
00:04:55,949 --> 00:05:02,189
stuff but eventually we opened an office

102
00:04:59,449 --> 00:05:03,899
Broadway and 45th and we offered that

103
00:05:02,189 --> 00:05:08,899
office the day we opened it it was too

104
00:05:03,899 --> 00:05:08,899
small so we kept going and
