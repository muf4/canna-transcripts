1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,349
you've made history here in Oregon with

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:05,819
legalization last year it was just

3
00:00:04,349 --> 00:00:09,239
coming on the verge of it and I'm so

4
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:11,190
glad to be back again and you know the

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,719
future really looks bright is all these

6
00:00:11,189 --> 00:00:14,189
clubs and stuff that are forming there

7
00:00:12,718 --> 00:00:16,439
like community centers and that's what

8
00:00:14,189 --> 00:00:19,198
this movement is about unity of the

9
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:20,339
people through nature and a plan man and

10
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,990
you know when we're talking about

11
00:00:20,339 --> 00:00:24,778
history not only talking about history

12
00:00:21,989 --> 00:00:26,640
of people like Jack hair and any lap in

13
00:00:24,778 --> 00:00:28,618
prison and stuff like that but people

14
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,140
like ray crystal who I shared this stage

15
00:00:28,618 --> 00:00:32,909
with last year man now he's gone but

16
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,009
that brother did so much for this cause

17
00:00:32,909 --> 00:00:36,659
you know and Paul helped out brother out

18
00:00:35,009 --> 00:00:37,769
Paul's done so much for this cause to

19
00:00:36,659 --> 00:00:39,959
and it's really important to remember

20
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:42,390
that and when we talk about cannabis

21
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,640
history man we're talking about tens of

22
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:46,259
thousands of years of history according

23
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,679
to the latest archaeological evidence

24
00:00:46,259 --> 00:00:51,359
we've been making hemp fibers for 32,000

25
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:53,549
years this comes in the forums of tools

26
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:56,429
used for breaking up the fibers of him

27
00:00:53,549 --> 00:00:58,738
we have evidence of hemp cloth 12,000

28
00:00:56,429 --> 00:00:59,789
years old you know what I mean so this

29
00:00:58,738 --> 00:01:02,519
is something that was spread out

30
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:04,439
throughout the whole agent world oldest

31
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,090
evidence of burning cannabis inhalers

32
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:08,609
fumes actually comes from the Ukraine

33
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:10,618
from 5500 years ago from a

34
00:01:08,609 --> 00:01:13,140
proto-indo-european these are the same

35
00:01:10,618 --> 00:01:14,609
people that domesticated the horse even

36
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,320
the domestication of the horse was

37
00:01:14,609 --> 00:01:18,629
thought to come about through the use of

38
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:20,309
hemp rope and so these same people that

39
00:01:18,629 --> 00:01:22,349
were making hemp rope domesticating the

40
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:24,600
horse they burned cannabis they spread

41
00:01:22,349 --> 00:01:26,459
the use of cannabis throughout the agent

42
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:28,408
world and you know I don't care where

43
00:01:26,459 --> 00:01:30,599
you're from in this world man your

44
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:32,430
culture has a connection with this plan

45
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:34,919
whether it be in China where they've

46
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:37,350
been using cannabis seeds and fiber for

47
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,118
food and cloth for probably four or five

48
00:01:37,349 --> 00:01:41,879
thousand years and burning it for

49
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:43,920
probably like 3,000 4,000 years you know

50
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:47,390
the oldest pharmacopoeia is from China

51
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:50,460
the pens at South ought to be 2700 bc

52
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:53,040
4700 years ago cannabis is probably the

53
00:01:50,459 --> 00:01:55,289
first medicine currently they think that

54
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,570
cavemen may have been using cannabis to

55
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:59,909
fight off parasites so this is coming

56
00:01:57,569 --> 00:02:02,879
from scientists people like dr. guy

57
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:05,130
Jeffries from GW Pharmaceuticals he

58
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:07,408
suggests that cannabis played a role in

59
00:02:05,129 --> 00:02:09,538
the Great Leap Forward this is when

60
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:12,750
humanity was discovering things like the

61
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:15,238
the making the wheel and how to control

62
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:17,340
fire so cannabis may have played a role

63
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:20,370
in that novel ability to think and

64
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:23,159
create a new ways and in Mesopotamia in

65
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:25,080
Assyria and Babylonia they burn cannabis

66
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:27,090
is in the temples under the name kanamu

67
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:29,250
and also anointed their skin with it and

68
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:32,039
this led over into the Hebrew use of it

69
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:34,139
where people like Moses use cannabis am

70
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:36,989
the Hebrew name of cannabis and the holy

71
00:02:34,139 --> 00:02:38,759
anointing oils and incense is man Moses

72
00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:41,159
would cover his body in cannabis and

73
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:43,019
myrrh and cinnamon oils then burn that

74
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:44,609
on the altar of incense and actually

75
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:46,920
speak to the Lord the pillar of smoke

76
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:49,590
over the incense altar and then in

77
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:51,839
Persia sorest her man one of the great

78
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:54,150
prophets of the ancient world used

79
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,469
cannabis and infused wines that was the

80
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:58,140
main source of enlightenment in the

81
00:02:55,469 --> 00:02:59,789
Zoroastrian religion in India man going

82
00:02:58,139 --> 00:03:01,679
back to the Stone Age longest

83
00:02:59,789 --> 00:03:05,039
continually worshipped God on earth

84
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,810
Shiva is the Lord of cannabis also Lord

85
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:08,759
of yoga you know what I mean there's a

86
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:10,620
whole movement of ganja yoga going on

87
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:12,299
right now because that's how yoga was

88
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:14,640
originally performed you can go to India

89
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:16,950
right now see sad news and other holy

90
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:18,869
men partaking of the Holy chillum in

91
00:03:16,949 --> 00:03:22,229
honor of Sheba before sitting down to

92
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:24,300
their yogic practices and Africa manage

93
00:03:22,229 --> 00:03:25,679
spread all over Africa pygmy said that

94
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:28,110
they've been using cannabis since the

95
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,569
dawn of time and that God gave them hemp

96
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:32,430
so they'd be healthy and happy so all

97
00:03:30,568 --> 00:03:35,579
over the world people have recognized

98
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:38,219
this powerful medicinal plant man first

99
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:40,500
medicine first sacrament and and

100
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:41,908
probably first recreational to you know

101
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:44,128
what I mean because it is about feeling

102
00:03:41,908 --> 00:03:46,439
good feeling positive and getting back

103
00:03:44,128 --> 00:03:48,389
into that vibration of nature you go to

104
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:50,699
any bar here in town I bet you at

105
00:03:48,389 --> 00:03:53,369
closing time you see this fights outside

106
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:56,068
of that bar I bet you that never happens

107
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:58,500
once in a medical club or a recreational

108
00:03:56,068 --> 00:04:00,089
club with cannabis just good vibes and

109
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,560
that's what this plan is about that's

110
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:03,870
what it's bringing to this planet right

111
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:06,060
now in this important time we can use

112
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:08,069
hemp to heal our planet stop cutting

113
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:11,009
down our old growth for us we can move

114
00:04:08,068 --> 00:04:12,389
away from fossil fuels with hemp fuel we

115
00:04:11,009 --> 00:04:14,489
can feed the world with the most

116
00:04:12,389 --> 00:04:16,039
nutritious plan on the world hemp seed

117

can heal our economy what's happening

121
00:04:22,189 --> 00:04:25,339

122
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:27,199
only these clubs with all the

123
00:04:25,339 --> 00:04:29,269
