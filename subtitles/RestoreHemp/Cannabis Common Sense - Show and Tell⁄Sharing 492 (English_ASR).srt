1

back Michael rules with eight for eight

5
00:00:14,439 --> 00:00:18,679
and obviously marijuana didn't slow him

6
00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:20,800
down I understand that he came out and

7
00:00:18,679 --> 00:00:22,879

00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,920
and didn't test positive for marijuana

9
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:26,480
and the urine test associated with there

10
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:30,000
so he must know that he has to wait a

11
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:32,359
month or so after he smoked before hear

12
