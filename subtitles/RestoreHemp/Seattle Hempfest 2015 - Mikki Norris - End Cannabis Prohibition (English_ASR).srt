1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,250
if you don't know who Peter McWilliams

2
00:00:01,589 --> 00:00:06,869
was Peter McWilliams was a publisher and

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:09,888
a writer who wrote a book called ain't

4
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:12,859
nobody's business if you do he was a

5
00:00:09,888 --> 00:00:16,948
very well known in the Libertarian Party

6
00:00:12,859 --> 00:00:20,339
and he unfortunately before he died he

7
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:24,929
was a defendant in a court case he was

8
00:00:20,339 --> 00:00:29,039
trying to sponsor some grows in in Los

9
00:00:24,929 --> 00:00:33,420
Angeles back in the late 90s and when he

10
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:36,750
did that they got busted by the feds and

11
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:40,559
he unfortunately cater him was it aids

12
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:43,230
patient and they would not allow him to

13
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:46,519
use cannabis as a condition of his

14
00:00:43,229 --> 00:00:50,429
release because they're drug-testing him

15
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:54,780
and as a result unfortunately Peter

16
00:00:50,429 --> 00:00:57,840
ended up dying choking on his vomit but

17
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:59,670
he was a hero to us before he died in

18
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:03,390
wearing and we were so happy for many

19
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:06,420
years to honor Peter and his memory but

20
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:08,069
now we're honoring Kevin black and he's

21
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,430
somebody we're going to miss he just

22
00:01:08,069 --> 00:01:13,079
passed away this this last june and

23
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:16,110
kevin was the head of security here for

24
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:19,289
hempfest for a while and what he did is

25
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:21,900
he turned the hemp fest security in to

26
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:25,560
hempfest safety making this a very

27
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:28,430
peaceful event as you know hempfest has

28
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:31,890
always been very peaceful because

29
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:36,240
partially because cannabis consumers are

30
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:38,868
very peaceful people are we and we

31
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:41,879
deserve that kind of respect and Kevin

32
00:01:38,868 --> 00:01:45,239
also was a bridge between law

33
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:48,030
enforcement and the hemp fest family so

34
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:53,009
he performed a very important service

35
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:54,810
here for hempfest he also and that's

36
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:58,159
important to get along with lon forth

37
00:01:54,810 --> 00:02:00,329
and we want them to respect us because

38
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:03,990
cannabis consumers are some of the

39
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:07,559
nicest most honest decent intelligent

40
00:02:03,989 --> 00:02:10,889
creative people that you know more than

41
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,900
I know that's all I can say we're the

42
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:16,199
good people and we really deserve out

43
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:18,830
equal rights and it it's time that we're

44
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:22,469
treated that way in this discrimination

45
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:25,349
Kevin also was a regional leader for the

46
00:02:22,469 --> 00:02:28,889
November coalition which brought light

47
00:02:25,348 --> 00:02:33,359
to many people in prison on drug fo and

48
00:02:28,889 --> 00:02:35,039
drug offenses their stories as did our

49
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,410
book shattered lies portraits from

50
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:40,049
America's drug war that is going to be

51
00:02:37,409 --> 00:02:44,340
coming out later this year as an e-book

52
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:46,290
it came out in 2099 82,000 is coming out

53
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:48,390
later this year we're going to update

54
00:02:46,289 --> 00:02:51,598
and then put some news stories because

55
00:02:48,389 --> 00:02:54,479
unfortunately there's still way too many

56
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:56,878
people in prison still wait too many

57
00:02:54,479 --> 00:03:01,199
people getting arrested for marijuana

58
00:02:56,878 --> 00:03:03,598
offenses all over this country but

59
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:07,530
meanwhile i want to thank you thank you

60
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:09,389
to Washington for passing I 502 I know

61
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:11,330
it's not perfect and a lot of people

62
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:14,848
aren't so happy with the way it's

63
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:18,330
unrolling rolling out but it's good it's

64
00:03:14,848 --> 00:03:21,598
sure sent a wonderful message around the

65
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:23,750
world that we need to legalize it that

66
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:26,759
we need to stop this discrimination

67
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:28,500
against cannabis consumers in the

68
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:31,919
workplace the discrimination that

69
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:34,739
unfortunately is still going on people

70
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:37,949
take these P tests and then they can't

71
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:39,989
get a job and that's not right it's not

72
00:03:37,949 --> 00:03:41,699
fair and it has nothing to do with

73
00:03:39,989 --> 00:03:43,980
whether they can do a job or if they're

74
00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:46,530
impaired on a job or anything it's just

75
00:03:43,979 --> 00:03:50,969
outright discrimination and we have to

76
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:56,159
say no to drug testing

77
00:03:50,969 --> 00:03:57,840
now Kevin also started he was also

78
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:00,539
involved with the million marijuana

79
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:03,030
marches that are still going on these

80
00:04:00,539 --> 00:04:07,739
days around the world and this year I

81
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:11,159
got to go to to Australia and then been

82
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:15,180
there which is kind of like the cannabis

83
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:17,930
capital of Australia and I have you note

84
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:21,329
that the world is watching Washington

85
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:24,930
I'm from California we're watching

86
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:28,949
Washington and next year we're going to

87
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:31,650
legalize it in California and we're

88
00:04:28,949 --> 00:04:33,269
going to do it hopefully we're going to

89
00:04:31,649 --> 00:04:36,899
do it right we're going to learn from

90
00:04:33,269 --> 00:04:39,930

96
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:59,970
all about equal rights for me it's

97
00:04:56,668 --> 00:05:03,319
