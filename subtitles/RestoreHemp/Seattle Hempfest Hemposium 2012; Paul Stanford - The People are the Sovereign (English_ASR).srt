1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:05,120
if the voters vote yes for your

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:07,199
initiative can we see a peaceful

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,800
transaction in the federal government

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,759
stay out of our out of the business of

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,359
orient or do you anticipate um more

6
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:14,559
court proceedings or how's that going to

7
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:17,439
proceed

8
00:00:14,558 --> 00:00:19,358
i anticipate more court proceedings uh

9
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,880
we designed our

10
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,400
proposal to

11
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:25,118
deal with the what i've always

12
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:27,439
considered an inevitable challenge

13
00:00:25,118 --> 00:00:29,039
by the federal government

14
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,559
we've done that by

15
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,840
raising a number of findings by the

16
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:34,079
people

17
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:35,840
we all live under the belief here in the

18
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,600
united states the people are the

19
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,840
sovereign and the ruler

20
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,399
so based on that belief we've

21
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,719
had findings by the people written into

22
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:46,480
our proposal

23
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,640
much as

24
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:50,718
oregon's death with dignity law was

25
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,719
enjoined in federal court and went to

26
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:56,239
the supreme court after two years on a

27
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:59,198
fast track supreme court ruled that

28
00:00:56,238 --> 00:01:01,038
doctors can recommend our prescribed

29
00:00:59,198 --> 00:01:03,599
phenobarbital for

30
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,799
terminally ill patients we think our

31
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:09,118
bill will

32
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:12,880
go into federal court and inevitably

33
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:14,959
change the controlled substances act

34
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:16,959
an even bigger hurdle is the single

35
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:20,719
convention treaty which mandates the

36
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:22,798
cannabis be a schedule one substance

37
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:25,359
in oregon our board of pharmacy has

38
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:28,000
already rescheduled marijuana to

39
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:30,478
schedule two as the board of pharmacy in

40
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,118
iowa so two states have already broken

41
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:35,438
with that restriction in contradiction

42
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:37,920
to the single convention treaty

43
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:39,758
our initiative also imposes a system of

44
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,280
controls that we lifted from the single

45
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,000
convention treaty

46
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,079
so

47
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,799
time will tell i have no confidence in

48
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:46,798
the

49
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:50,079
composition of the supreme court under

50
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:52,000
chief justice roberts but

51
00:01:50,078 --> 00:01:54,478
you

52
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,478
it's the best shot we have i believe

53
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:57,478
thanks
