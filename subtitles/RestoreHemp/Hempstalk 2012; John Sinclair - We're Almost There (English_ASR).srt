1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:05,640
I've been in this um marijuana

2
00:00:02,839 --> 00:00:07,040
legalization movement like he said since

3
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:10,960
about

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:13,879
1964 long before most of you were born

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:16,839
my prayer in my entire adult life has

6
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:17,960
been to see marijuana legalized in the

7
00:00:16,839 --> 00:00:20,759
United

8
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:24,199
States before I have to leave this

9
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:26,560
planet and go on to the next one like we

10
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:26,560
all

11
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:33,960
must that's my dream and my prayer

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,200
and I'm not going to Harang you about

13
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,399
why marijuana should be legalized it

14
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:41,200
would be like trying to tell some angels

15
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,200
why they should have

16
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,719
wings one thing I know all of us would

17
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,440
rather live in a world where we aren't

18
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:51,558
treated as criminals where the police

19
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:54,920
had no business with what was going on

20
00:00:51,558 --> 00:00:58,039
inside our [ __ ]

21
00:00:54,920 --> 00:01:01,679
heads what do the police have with what

22
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:06,280
goes on in our heads it's our business

23
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:09,000
so one day I pray this will be over with

24
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:11,400
in Michigan I'm a medical marijuana

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,159
patient registered with the state I got

26
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,680
my card on

27
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:18,920
me

28
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:21,320
yeah in Detroit where I

29
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:24,519
based we're going to vote for

30
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:28,279
legalization in the city of Detroit this

31
00:01:24,519 --> 00:01:30,798
November and I think we'll probably

32
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:34,439
win years and years years ago we

33
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:37,360
established in an Arbor Michigan in

34
00:01:34,438 --> 00:01:40,839
1972 a local ordinance that made

35
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:44,280
marijuana possession or sales of any

36
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:46,799
sort subject to a $5

37
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:49,399
ticket and that's been in effect there

38
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:54,200
for 40 years now I think they raised it

39
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:57,759
to $25 kind of a in nod to

40
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:59,680
inflation but it's still just a ticket

41
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,920
that's as good as it gets before you

42
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,439
have pure legalization which I hope

43
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,439
we'll have here in Oregon so I've always

44
00:02:04,438 --> 00:02:09,239
wanted to go to the hempstock Festival

45
00:02:06,438 --> 00:02:11,560
I've never had the opportunity before

46
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:15,439
and then Paul Stanford invited me this

47
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:19,159
year and said we're trying to pass our

48
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:21,560
measure number 80 to legalize marijuana

49
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:25,199
in Oregon and really I wanted to be part

50
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:27,239
of that so I'm glad to be here today I

51
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:28,878
spend a lot of time in Amsterdam where

52
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:31,439
you just buy your weight over the

53
00:02:28,878 --> 00:02:34,120
counter you don't even have to be

54
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:37,400
sick you can buy some weed just to get

55
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:39,959
high on they got really good weed and

56
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:42,480
the prices are something you can live

57
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:45,598
with it's a beautiful thing we got one

58
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:48,280
coffee shop here in Portland I had the

59
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:51,878
opportunity to visit last night the

60
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:54,479
World Famous Cannabis Cafe here in

61
00:02:51,878 --> 00:02:57,199
Portland and that's a good start I think

62
00:02:54,479 --> 00:03:00,719
it's the first one maybe in the USA am I

63
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:02,679
right yeah well I live in in a coffee

64
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:05,239

65
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:07,000
coffee shop get high drink coffee see my

66
00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:09,400

music and have a good

68
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:16,280
time it's a civilized way to

69
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:20,199
live so I'm praying that yall are going

70
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:22,598
to pass this legislation in November I

71
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:26,359
just wanted to have one preachment and

72
00:03:22,598 --> 00:03:28,878
that is the necessity to register to

73
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:31,720
vote because if you AR registered to

74
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:33,318
vote and then you don't actually vote

75
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:35,120
then these other idiots are going to

76
00:03:33,318 --> 00:03:38,000
continue their

77
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:42,080
tyranny the other side they vote every

78
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,598
[ __ ] time they very rarely miss a

79
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,640
vote all of them vote and that's why we

80
00:03:44,598 --> 00:03:49,000
get our ass kicked all the time because

81
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:50,958
we forget to vote or we don't think it's

82
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,639
important or they Hoodwinked us into

83
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:55,840
thinking it wasn't

84
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:58,078
necessary it's always good to vote man I

85
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,759
love democracy this is a great way to

86
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:02,719
live a democracy you got to vote but you

87
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:05,598
got to use it in order to use it you got

88
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:08,199
to register to vote in a timely fashion

89
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:12,199
so that's the one piece of grandfatherly

90
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:14,438
advice I can convey to you this

91
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:17,719
afternoon other than

92
00:04:14,438 --> 00:04:19,918
that I was reminding Paul Stanford

93
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:22,280
yesterday when we were on his television

94
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:25,719
show I was with the Great American poet

95
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:30,399
John trudell and I was

96
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:33,520
reminding my brothers that it was poets

97
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:38,279
who started the marijuana legalization

98
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:40,478
movement Alan Ginsburg Edward Sanders

99
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:44,478
they were in the very Forefront of this

100
00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:47,478
movement way back in 1964 and

101
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:48,839
1965 I was right behind them coming out

102
00:04:47,478 --> 00:04:51,079
of

103
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:53,679
Detroit and you had people here in

104
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:57,038
Oregon like King key who spearheaded

105
00:04:53,680 --> 00:05:01,199
this idea for many

106
00:04:57,038 --> 00:05:03,560
years so you get to remember

107
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:06,319
poetry comes into this at the basic

108
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,319
level
