1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,960
and so we believe things like this will

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:10,119
help stop deforestation this is a hemp

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:12,798
fiber board produced at Washington State

4
00:00:10,119 --> 00:00:14,518
University uh by their wood science labs

5
00:00:12,798 --> 00:00:16,480
and they've shown that it's the

6
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:19,519
strongest fiber board they produced it's

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:22,679
actually stronger than steel and so we

8
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:26,039
think that uh once we cultivate

9
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:28,678
Industrial Hemp we'll slow or reverse

10
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:31,320
the deforestation and environmental

11
00:00:28,678 --> 00:00:34,960
degradation our plant planet's been

12
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:37,960
suffering and uh uh that the industrial

13
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:40,679
hemp will transform our economy and stop

14
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:44,480
the uh

15
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:46,479
uh the use of petroleum as to Wi degree

16
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:49,878
as it is used today we believe that

17
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:51,959
that's really the the key crucial

18
00:00:49,878 --> 00:00:54,479
element of cannabis prohibition the

19
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:57,840
reason they we were sold the marijuana

20
00:00:54,479 --> 00:01:01,759
myth back 70 years ago is to protect the

21
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:04,838
petrochemical industry and and uh uh

22
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:08,118
this will reverse that and so it'll also

23
00:01:04,838 --> 00:01:10,560
allow adults to grow their own and uh

24
00:01:08,118 --> 00:01:14,759
just as people can produce their own

25
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,759
tobacco or alcohol products
