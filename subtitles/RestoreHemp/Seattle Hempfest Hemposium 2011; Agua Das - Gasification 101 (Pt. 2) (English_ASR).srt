1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:07,600
of uh the principles of

2
00:00:03,399 --> 00:00:10,400
gasification uh this is a lit cigarette

3
00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:12,798
and uh when I when the air goes the

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:16,960
normal Direction when the air goes this

5
00:00:12,798 --> 00:00:19,439
way the all the oxygen is burned up and

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,839
uh makes heat and it roasts the tobacco

7
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:21,839
into

8
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:30,278
charcoal you see how white that smoke is

9
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:33,039
I hope you're able to pick that up now

10
00:00:30,278 --> 00:00:36,558
if I blow this way there's oxygen

11
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:39,558
available right at the flame

12
00:00:36,558 --> 00:00:42,558
front but there's no [Â __Â ] see the

13
00:00:39,558 --> 00:00:43,839
smoke is invisible bad ass dude that's

14
00:00:42,558 --> 00:00:46,959
the principle right there we're talking

15
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:50,800
about okay this is tar

16
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,799
destruction this is tar

17
00:00:53,719 --> 00:01:00,239
production one3 of the weight of the

18
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:02,198
cigarette gets turned into tars

19
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:05,640
[Â __Â ] crazy when I reverse it and

20
00:01:02,198 --> 00:01:10,039
that's so 1/3 equals

21
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:13,359
300,000 parts per million wow okay that

22
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:17,920
that's 1/3 is 300,000 parts per million

23
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:22,200
I'm rounding off now when I reverse the

24
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:24,879
flow I take it down to 1,000 parts per

25
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:27,159
million I don't know how to express the

26
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:28,920
reduction I'll call that a 300 bold

27
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:31,680
reduction in

28
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:34,920
tars and that gives us a gas that's much

29
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,200
more cleanable cuz those tars will gum

30
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:40,478
up an

31
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:43,359
engine and then I have a patent that uh

32
00:01:40,478 --> 00:01:45,640
I was the inventor of which takes us

33
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:49,118
down from a th000 parts per million down

34
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:51,680
to under 100 parts per million tars

35
00:01:49,118 --> 00:01:54,680
which gives us a very easily cleanable

36
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,680
gas
