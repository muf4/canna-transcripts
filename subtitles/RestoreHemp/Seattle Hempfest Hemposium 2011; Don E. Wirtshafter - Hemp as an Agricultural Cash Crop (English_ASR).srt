1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:04,040
so what you need to know about

2
00:00:02,158 --> 00:00:06,838
Industrial Hemp is that we've been able

3
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:09,240
to produce it in Canada now for 14 years

4
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:11,559
without embarrassment without any

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,839
stories of kids going in and selling in

6
00:00:11,558 --> 00:00:16,480
the high schools or any of these

7
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:18,640
problems whatsoever at all and the

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:21,160
Canadian police have been able to tell

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:24,480
the difference between industrial hemp

10
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:26,800
and pot really easily and our police are

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,679
no dumber than the Canadian place

12
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:33,239
they're equally dumb I

13
00:00:28,678 --> 00:00:35,079
agree it's so so um we could do this

14
00:00:33,238 --> 00:00:39,599
here and it's just

15
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:42,439
political um um um inertia lack of any

16
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,719
inertia in politics that that uh right

17
00:00:42,439 --> 00:00:47,119
now that have got us stuck in the mud

18
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:49,280
and our Farmers totally handcuffed and

19
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:52,000
so the support we're hearing and seeing

20
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:54,679
in Congress is from these Farm Belt

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,840
states why because these Farmers hear

22
00:00:54,679 --> 00:01:00,039
Canadian radio and they understand that

23
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,000
farmers up north are doing really well

24
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:03,000
on this crop and they want a piece of

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,159
the

26
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,159
action and we can do it here
