1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,200
as you just heard my name is Sid Mauer

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:06,540
and I am a former local news anchor from

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:08,400
Eugene Oregon and still really new for

4
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:10,530
me to be talking about this and standing

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,900
on a stage talking about cannabis

6
00:00:10,529 --> 00:00:15,989
something that I of course like many of

7
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:18,719
you have worked on hiding for many years

8
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:21,300
before this so um what happened to me

9
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:24,000
was I was forced to take a drug test and

10
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:26,339
was fired due to in active THC

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,439
metabolites in my system most of you out

12
00:00:26,339 --> 00:00:30,059
there probably understand that when you

13
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:31,649
consume cannabis it interacts with your

14
00:00:30,059 --> 00:00:35,039
body differently than almost anything

15
00:00:31,649 --> 00:00:37,979
else and traces of it even when inactive

16
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:40,109
stay in your system for up to 30 days so

17
00:00:37,979 --> 00:00:44,339
even though I was completely one hundred

18
00:00:40,109 --> 00:00:46,890
percent sober at work I was penalized

19
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:49,530
and fired for personal cannabis use in

20
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:51,270
my own time what's more is my news

21
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:54,210
director and assistant news director my

22
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:56,309
immediate bosses fought for me to keep

23
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:57,600
my job so in case anyone out there was

24
00:00:56,308 --> 00:01:00,718
wondering if it was something else going

25
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,000
on it wasn't i was told verbatim that it

26
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,670
was my drug test that came back positive

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,099
for THC metabolites that led to my

28
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:09,810
firing and instead of just being quiet

29
00:01:08,099 --> 00:01:11,609
about it and kind of pretending like

30
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:13,320
that didn't happen trying to maybe go

31
00:01:11,609 --> 00:01:16,859
back into the news or back into the

32
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:19,048
corporate world I was so frustrated so

33
00:01:16,859 --> 00:01:21,900
frustrated that I had to speak out

34
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:24,030
against it it was completely legal for

35
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:27,170
an out of state attorney corporate

36
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:29,969
attorney to fire me but it wasn't right

37
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:32,009
legal but not right and that is why I'm

38
00:01:29,969 --> 00:01:35,340
speaking out against it so a little more

39
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:38,159
backstory on my on my situation like

40
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:40,710
many news stations out there my station

41
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:43,109
was very very comfortable with drug

42
00:01:40,709 --> 00:01:44,399
testing people I am not exaggerating was

43
00:01:43,109 --> 00:01:46,769
saying that I had a co-worker who

44
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,960
tripped and was drug tested I had a

45
00:01:46,769 --> 00:01:51,629
co-worker who bumped her head and was

46
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:53,669
drug tested and for my situation I was

47
00:01:51,629 --> 00:01:55,349
in rush hour traffic and I tapped the

48
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:56,969
bumper of the car in front of me and was

49
00:01:55,349 --> 00:01:59,519
forced to take a drug test so even

50
00:01:56,968 --> 00:02:01,739
though i left two scratches on a bumper

51
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:03,658
in front of me was completely sober and

52
00:02:01,739 --> 00:02:05,908
that wouldn't have led to me getting

53
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:09,868
fired because i used cannabis in my

54
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:11,610
personal time i was fired and like i

55
00:02:09,868 --> 00:02:13,379
said this is completely legal and i

56
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:14,820
truly believe that the only

57
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:17,310
that we're going to see any change any

58
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:19,139
movement in these unfair policies is if

59
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:21,539
we continue to educate and expose people

60
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:23,639
to the truth about cannabis if this

61
00:02:21,539 --> 00:02:26,519
policy was in place to keep people safer

62
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:28,559
it's sailing there's no reason to

63
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:31,110
believe that someone who uses cannabis

64
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:34,140
in their free time is that all unsafe or

65
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:36,570
less safe than someone who say consumes

66
00:02:34,139 --> 00:02:38,399
alcohol in their free time so let's take

67
00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:41,310
a minute to think about my situation had

68
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,680
I used alcohol or had I use even a

69
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:46,560
harder substance like meth or cocaine

70
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:50,310
days before my accident I would still

71
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,750
have my job but because it was cannabis

72
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:55,080
and like I said it stays in your system

73
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:57,419
for longer I lost my job we need to

74
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:00,300
explain to businesses that this is bad

75
00:02:57,419 --> 00:03:02,729
business practice it's not keeping

76
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:04,920
anyone safer and it's actually sending a

77
00:03:02,729 --> 00:03:07,799
really negative message to employees

78
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:09,689
right top employers like Microsoft for

79
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,790
instance they don't drug test because

80
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:15,960
they respect their current or

81
00:03:11,789 --> 00:03:20,569
prospective employees there are so many

82
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:20,570
reasons that drug testing is wrong

83
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:25,919
exactly policeman aren't drug tested and

84
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:27,659
in fact the FBI for instance has stopped

85
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:29,189
drug testing certain departments because

86
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:31,710
they weren't getting the application

87
00:03:29,189 --> 00:03:33,810
turn out that they needed it is known

88
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:37,500
that using cannabis in your free time

89
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:40,140
does not increase your risk as a worker

90
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:41,669
therefore this policy should not be in

91
00:03:40,139 --> 00:03:43,379
place it'd be different right if it was

92
00:03:41,669 --> 00:03:45,030
a reactionary thing if there was a time

93
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:47,400
in history where we can point that

94
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:49,979
cannabis was legal and a bunch of people

95
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:52,050
were just coming to work stoned and

96
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:54,810
causing you know just terrible dangerous

97
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:57,120
accidents all the time guess what that's

98
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:58,620
never happened that is not the news

99
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,750
story that I was in the news business

100
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:03,120
for years and never once was there some

101
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:05,789
crazy incident about someone coming to

102
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:08,340
work and causing accidents because they

103
00:04:05,789 --> 00:04:10,109
were stoned on cannabis this instance or

104
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:11,849
this policy was put in place because

105
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:16,069
Ronald Reagan decided that he wanted to

106
00:04:11,849 --> 00:04:18,899
make a federal drug free workplace

107
00:04:16,069 --> 00:04:21,529
policy basically and because of that it

108
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:25,439
spread and we are where we are today so

109
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:27,039
like I mentioned I am speaking out to

110
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:28,779
educate people and expose people I

111
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,210
truly believe some people really just

112
00:04:28,779 --> 00:04:32,859
don't understand cannabis and that's why

113
00:04:31,209 --> 00:04:34,449
they're against it so if there's

114
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:37,000
anything that I could explain to you is

115
00:04:34,449 --> 00:04:38,889
talk about it come out of the cannabis

116
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,959
closet if you don't talk about your

117
00:04:38,889 --> 00:04:42,729
cannabis use how is anyone supposed to

118
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:44,649
understand that it doesn't make you a

119
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:47,170
bad person it doesn't make you more

120
00:04:44,649 --> 00:04:49,060
dangerous more lazy or any worse than

121
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:50,860
someone who chooses to use alcohol or

122
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:53,740
any other substance in their free time

123
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:55,210
so please keep talking about it if

124
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:57,160
