1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,150
when you picture a cannabis consumer who

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:09,410
is it that comes to mind I hope that

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:16,378
that image that used to be one of lazy

4
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:18,179
stoner stupid hungry all of the all of

5
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:20,640
the awful Serio types that are

6
00:00:18,179 --> 00:00:22,710
absolutely not true I hope that those

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,960
that image of who a cannabis consumer

8
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:28,830
for you has changed because I know for

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:31,710
me it certainly has we are not lazy we

10
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:33,509
are in fact more motivated than nearly

11
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:35,730
anybody on the planet I was reading an

12
00:00:33,509 --> 00:00:38,369
article yesterday saying that people who

13
00:00:35,729 --> 00:00:40,679
consume cannabis and exercise exercise

14
00:00:38,369 --> 00:00:43,649
for longer I mean we're really finding

15
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:45,750
some cool trends and this the stigmas

16
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:49,020
are being shattered about who cannabis

17
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:51,840
consumers are for me as a mother as a

18
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:54,359
woman as a business owner as someone who

19
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:58,170
volunteers with nonprofits and advocates

20
00:00:54,359 --> 00:01:00,238
for education choices and all of the

21
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:02,340
cannabis legalization things

22
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:04,079
particularly social consumption which is

23
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:06,478
on the topic that I'm particularly

24
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:08,938
interested in as well I implore all of

25
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:11,340
you to support the social consumption

26
00:01:08,938 --> 00:01:14,789
movement going on there is a place to

27
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:17,850
sign up over there but I know for me as

28
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:20,040
a woman in this world right now I want

29
00:01:17,849 --> 00:01:23,938
to scream from the rooftops that I am a

30
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:25,860
cannabis consumer I don't look like the

31
00:01:23,938 --> 00:01:28,258
typical cannabis consumer although today

32
00:01:25,859 --> 00:01:30,060
I may in my cannabis dress which I wear

33
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:32,099
proudly

34
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:34,379
but in other areas of my life I don't

35
00:01:32,099 --> 00:01:36,478
look like a cannabis consumer and I go

36
00:01:34,379 --> 00:01:39,000
out of my way to tell everybody that I

37
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:41,400
am because I think it's up to each of us

38
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,159
right now to go out into the world and

39
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,990
say this is my medicine and I know so

40
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:50,359
many other people that are finding

41
00:01:45,989 --> 00:01:50,359
healing relief from cannabis as well

42
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:59,000
[Applause]

43
00:01:56,469 --> 00:02:01,009
my teenage self would have never

44
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:06,950
believed what I would do when I grew up

45
00:02:01,009 --> 00:02:08,629
I pinched myself nearly every day my

46
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:10,550
name is Samantha Montanaro and I'm the

47
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:13,579
co-founder of toca tivity the global

48
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:16,100
cannabis community for women we have

49
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:18,920
women's communities that organize events

50
00:02:16,099 --> 00:02:23,000
in the United States South Africa Spain

51
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:24,729
and Canada and soon 135 other cities

52
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,349
around the world

53
00:02:24,729 --> 00:02:32,359
something that I have learned from this

54
00:02:27,349 --> 00:02:35,269
women's community is the ultimate love

55
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:37,310
that cannabis brings to the surface and

56
00:02:35,269 --> 00:02:41,750
how cannabis can be a vehicle for us

57
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:43,430
being our best selves women when they

58
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:46,430
get together and consume cannabis

59
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:50,629
together there is this this swirling

60
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:53,209
magical energy that is really truly

61
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:55,310
magical and I think we all regardless of

62
00:02:53,209 --> 00:02:58,280
gender feel that when we consume

63
00:02:55,310 --> 00:03:01,729
cannabis it is such a beautiful plant

64
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:05,719
and it is my life's work from now until

65
00:03:01,729 --> 00:03:07,879
forever she advocated for the walls

66
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:10,280
coming down around cannabis for equal

67
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:11,430
access and really for global

68
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:14,618
legalization

69
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:14,618
