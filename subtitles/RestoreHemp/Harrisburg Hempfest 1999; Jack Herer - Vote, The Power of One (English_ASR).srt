paper for

16
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:50,480
marijuana and I looked down on my

17
00:00:47,238 --> 00:00:52,119
lid and I just could a picture how they

18
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:54,398
made

19
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:57,280
paper I was from Buffalo New York

20
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,920
originally they don't do that back

21
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,198

19 20 year old kid going to college he

24
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:11,039

25
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:13,079
sales and

26
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,439
clothes

27
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:17,719
marijuana I had barely ever heard the

28
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:20,399
word hemp before in my life and usually

29
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:20,400
with a hemp

30
00:01:20,478 --> 00:01:26,158
Thro it just kept growing after I wrote

31
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:30,118
this book people thought I must know

32
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:33,200
something about p i at that time 1973

33
00:01:30,118 --> 00:01:37,239
early 73 I probably couldn't identify a

34
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,240
pop plant if I stumbled

35
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:46,438
up in 1973 I met a guy named captain

36
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,640
edare he owned a head shop in Los

37
00:01:46,438 --> 00:01:53,118
Angeles called heads and high then van

38
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:58,039
eyes another one

39
00:01:53,118 --> 00:02:00,759
in when by himself this guy in

40
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:04,960
1972 decided that when they were

41
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:08,598
collecting signatures to put California

42
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:11,680
marijuana ship on the ballot he decided

43
00:02:08,598 --> 00:02:14,839
the unpaid volunteered initiative he

44
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:19,200
decided to open the store 24 hours a day

45
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:23,680
7 days a week and he give people 50% off

46
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:26,679
if they bring in off a water pipe off

47
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,680

48
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:31,839

49
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:38,759
hello

50
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:43,680
so here we were with

51
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:44,799
this Captain Ed in 1972 opened the store

52
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,280
around the

53
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:50,239
clock and did something no human being

54
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:55,439
had ever done before that I have ever

55
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:58,239
heard he collected 140,000 signatures

56
00:02:55,439 --> 00:03:01,199
from his two stores in the San Fernando

57
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:03,640
Valley one third of all the signatures

58
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:06,158
that were collected in the state of

59
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:09,158
California to put the marijuana

60
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:13,158
initiative by volunteers on the

61
00:03:09,158 --> 00:03:15,878
ballot that hundreds of petitioners came

62
00:03:13,158 --> 00:03:18,318
out of the store would go out come back

63
00:03:15,878 --> 00:03:20,479
he'd give them some bucks off something

64
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:22,679
he'd smoke them out if they have place

65
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:24,878
to sleep he'd sleep them in the

66
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:28,000
backro it was a hell of a thing you

67
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:31,759
couldn't believe it worked it wasn't us

68
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,639
steel and it wasn't

69
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:38,120
the US government or the Army this is a

70
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:40,518
rag tag bunch of people that basically

71
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:46,000
look like we do right

72
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:48,239

00:04:13,158 --> 00:04:18,560

California in June when it

qualified the ballot for the ballot the

101
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:14,759
initiative had

102
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:20,240
9% of the

103
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:23,240
vote about 81% against it and

104
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,240
10%

105
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:29,240
undecided as July and August and

106
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,160
September and October came the numbers

107
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:33,280

108
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:36,520
small 10% 12%

109
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:39,239
15 and Halloween just before the

110
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:42,839
election in November

111
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:46,000
1972 with the ever popular Richard Nixon

112
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:46,000
running for the

113
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:54,600
president we had 19% of the vote

114
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:57,120
everybody thought we would get

115
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:59,960
slaughtered everybody had discounted the

116
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:02,759
marijuana movement the be for the

117
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:05,560
hippies that have collected the

118
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:06,520
signatures a no money movement nothing

119
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:10,439
behind

120
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:13,279
it they got 34% of the vote and that

121
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:16,680
blew politicians away in state after

122
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:19,399
State Oregon Alaska California

123
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:22,840
decriminalized marijuana because of that

124
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:25,279
vote and they only started with 9% you

125
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:28,239
remember when they qualified in June it

126
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:31,559
was put out a ballot by hippies that

127
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:33,840
knew when you went out to petition as a

128
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:36,120
volunteer there's no nothing wrong with

129
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:37,478
making money petitioning but if you

130
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:40,000
volunteer that you're going to go

131
00:06:37,478 --> 00:06:42,478
collect signatures go collect the

132
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
signatures your word should be as good

133
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:47,318
as your money if you can't collect them

134
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,360

178
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:08,640
ballot by 40,000 which they later

179
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:11,039
admitted they Mis counted but wouldn't

180
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:13,559
put us on the B 10 years later the

181
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:15,719
government of Oregon did the same to the

182
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:18,199
Oregon marijuana this year in

183
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:20,800
1984 they said we missed the ballot by

184
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:22,759
300 I had come up here with a bunch of

185
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:25,159
Californians and helped collect the

186
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:28,439
signatures to put Oregon on the ballot

187
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:32,240
they said we missed by 300,000 300

188
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:34,240
signatures I of about 75 80,000

189
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,000
collected about 2 weeks from the

190
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,240
initiative time they said hey you know

191
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,078
what we miss counted you get you got

192
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:44,200
enough SE to get on the battle too late

193
00:09:40,078 --> 00:09:46,000
to PR PR put you on some tough [ __ ] you

194
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:49,800
guys are

195
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,799
off that's pretty short

196
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:55,560
trip we often didn't have lawyers to

197
00:09:53,639 --> 00:10:00,000
fight for

198
00:09:55,559 --> 00:10:01,879
us let me tell you in 1973 and 7 before

199
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,078
as those

200
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:08,200
people came up to

201
00:10:05,078 --> 00:10:12,120
me and told

202
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:15,079
me that we could win the

203
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:17,519
battle that we could get the signatures

204
00:10:15,078 --> 00:10:21,039
and I thought we could do it voluntarily

205
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:24,039
I've tried probably 15 times in various

206
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:27,599
States mostly California and missed the

207
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:30,559
ballot until with Dennis Peron last year

208
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:33,240
or three years ago we collected the

209
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:36,399
signatures we got on the balance we won

210
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:39,440
a very liberal very very liberal medical

211
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:41,399
marijuana in California if you got

212
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:44,720
headaches you got stress you got

213
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:47,159
backaches you got attitude you can get a

214
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:49,399
note the hardest part about getting a

215
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:52,559
note in California is the federal

216
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:54,839
government has threatened doctors with

217
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:57,559
the loss of their license they haven't

218
00:10:54,839 --> 00:11:01,240
taken one away but they scared the hell

219
00:10:57,559 --> 00:11:01,239
of the doctors

220
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:09,120
many few doctors will give you notes if

221
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:09,120
I had 20 speakers I'd make people listen

222
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,120
to

223
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:17,879
so when you think of all this work that

224
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,440
people been doing the reason you can sit

225
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:22,399
here and smoke a

226
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:25,480
bowl if you have to

227
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:27,759
today is because it's decriminalized in

228
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:30,278
Oregon it's decriminalized because about

229
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:31,958
a half a dozen or dozen people here

230
00:11:30,278 --> 00:11:33,720
including Bill

231
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:37,759
Ki

232
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:39,480
masas voter power these people that you

233
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:42,559
just barely

234
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:45,278
know went out and collected

235
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:48,000
signatures when the Oregon legislature

236
00:11:45,278 --> 00:11:50,439
Rec criminalized and govern kenh or B or

237
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,159
whatever his name is signed it we were

238
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:54,200
at the rainbow gathering we went out and

239
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:57,278
collected signatures we left the rainbow

240
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:59,759
gathering stoned out of our mind on July

241
00:11:57,278 --> 00:12:02,278
5th you know what we were doing on July

242
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:05,360
3rdd when they signed it in July 4th

243
00:12:02,278 --> 00:12:07,919
when we decided to come to stay in

244
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:10,720
Oregon not go back to California and

245
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:12,599
collect the signatures put it on the B

246
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,320
stop the law from going into effect you

247
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:18,000
only have 90 days to stop a law from

248
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:21,120
going into effect it's called a

249
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,919
referendum seldom seldom used but we

250
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,560
went in 90 days we collected the

251
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:28,519
signatures

252
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:31,439
stop the law of Oregon from RE

253
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:33,839
criminalizing marijuana down to a

254
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:36,320
seed where they can take your education

255
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:38,440
your car your kids go right home with

256
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,399
you they find a joint in your car now

257
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:42,240
they must write you a ticket if they

258
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,440
find a joint in your car under that new

259
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,720
law they could take you home and search

260
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,720
your

261
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:52,599
house so we went and we decided we have

262
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:54,360
no time to talk it over we only have 90

263
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:57,720
days from one a law passes on a

264
00:12:54,360 --> 00:13:00,600
referendum to stop it only a few States

265
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:03,440
have referendums is one of

266
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:06,680
them they said we lose even the PTI of

267
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:09,560
for us said we were lose then we put out

268
00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:14,159
a medical initiative that might

269
00:13:09,559 --> 00:13:16,638
pass might pass but Rec criminalization

270
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:19,159
was here it was a fact that it came up

271
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:22,079
to a vote 8 months nine months ago in

272
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:22,078
November

273
00:13:22,839 --> 00:13:28,240
98 a lot of people thought we were going

274
00:13:25,278 --> 00:13:30,360
to lose early on in that thing we wound

275
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:35,240
up winning by

276
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:35,240
66% and I was happy to say [ __ ] the

277
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:41,519
orium they put you in jail take away

278
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:43,799
your rights it's a sloppy newspaper for

279
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,799
a

280
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:51,320
State marijuana in case you ever had to

281
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:55,240
defended hemp don't forget is the

282
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:58,079
greatest single plant on our

283
00:13:55,240 --> 00:14:01,278
Earth think of about 3 and2 million

284
00:13:58,078 --> 00:14:03,919
plants in one plant is greater than all

285
00:14:01,278 --> 00:14:06,720
the other plants that grow on Earth

286
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:08,879
combined that's just one at a time like

287
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:12,839
a king kong

288
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:16,198
over a retinue of of other plants or or

289
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:18,759
beings or animals but like a King Kong's

290
00:14:16,198 --> 00:14:22,120
King Kong one plant to make all the

291
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:25,079
paper all the fiber all the fuel nobody

292
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:29,240
wants it to but isn't it nice we have

293
00:14:25,078 --> 00:14:31,039
something to stop fossil fuels to stop

294
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:33,480
poison

295
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:35,838
Plastics we have another way of living

296
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:39,480
on Earth but it takes you to register to

297
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:42,519
vote it takes you to register to vote

298
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:45,079
and to vote and if you move re-register

299
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:48,440
and get everybody around you to register

300
00:14:45,078 --> 00:14:50,399
and re-register and re-register and vote

301
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:52,360
on issues there might be things you

302
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:55,000
might not want to vote

303
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:57,879
for or

304
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:01,039
against but you'll find the lesser of

305
00:14:57,879 --> 00:15:03,838
evils and at least a choice and one day

306
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:06,360
you'll have things on the ballot like

307
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:09,160
initiatives that you're interested in

308
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:12,680
and you can actually do something you

309
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:15,759
can vote and cancel out some goopo type

310
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:18,758
brain who wants to vote in a synthetic

311
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:18,759
future for

312
00:15:20,929 --> 00:15:26,120
[Applause]

313
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:32,479
mankind

314
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:34,800
so you live longer if you smoke pop than

315
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:38,560
if you do no drugs at all give me some

316
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:38,559
you live 8 to 24 years

317
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:43,759
longer need to 24 years longer as I told

318
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:48,919
you before with people that use alcohol

319
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:52,000
and tobacco I often tell this driving

320
00:15:48,919 --> 00:15:53,360
story you're driving down the freeway

321
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,360
and you're

322
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:59,919
straight and you go to mue

323
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:01,399
exit you go

324
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:03,639
well let me get over there and you cross

325
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:04,720
three lanes you get over you see it

326
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:09,440
every

327
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:11,519
day if you're drunk you go to Mr free

328
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:15,360
AC get

329
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:20,198
over you blindly cross another couple

330
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:23,399
Lanes but if you're ston out of your

331
00:16:20,198 --> 00:16:26,359
G and you go to pass your freeway

332
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:27,919
action what I usually see

333
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:30,720
is

334
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:32,759
who

to get on the ballot for marijuana they

397
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:39,960
are not my preferred words but I signed

398
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,119
them if

399
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:45,360
I they belong on the ballot if we have

400
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:47,959
nothing else to put on the ballot

401
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:49,959

can teach this information

403
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:56,000
comprehensively and there are 80,000 of

404
00:19:52,839 --> 00:19:58,319
