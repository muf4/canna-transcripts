1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,469
I think that marijuana is the greatest

2
00:00:04,528 --> 00:00:10,230
gift from our mother earth God the

3
00:00:07,469 --> 00:00:15,059
Creator Gaia the greatest gift that our

4
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:18,028
planet has given us that hip can restore

5
00:00:15,058 --> 00:00:20,219
all of our energy needs or at least a

6
00:00:18,028 --> 00:00:23,759
large percentage of them you can provide

7
00:00:20,219 --> 00:00:27,059
a huge resourcing in terms of food and

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:30,929
in fiber the only reason we have

9
00:00:27,059 --> 00:00:33,869
marijuana prohibition is because it

10
00:00:30,928 --> 00:00:36,179
produces more fuel fiber food and

11
00:00:33,869 --> 00:00:38,759
medicine than any other plan lit created

12
00:00:36,179 --> 00:00:44,128
a misinformation campaign to call it

13
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:48,238
marijuana 75 years ago so you know I'm

14
00:00:44,128 --> 00:00:51,479
glad I 502 past but it's really just

15
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:54,890
partial decriminalization it's not legal

16
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:57,419
for you to have a single marijuana plant

17
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:59,579
but this is the most productive plant

18
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:02,510
known to man not only is it the most

19
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:06,269
productive plant it produces more fuel

20
00:01:02,509 --> 00:01:10,200
over 300 gallons of oil per acre more

21
00:01:06,269 --> 00:01:14,429
food over 6 tons of protein after breast

22
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:16,890
oil out of it and more fiber 35 to 40

23
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:19,439
tons of fiber per acre while at the same

24
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:23,400
time restoring the soil with the Leafs

25
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:25,978
and other processes it draws up some

26
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:29,549
soil nutrients and makes it available in

27
00:01:25,978 --> 00:01:32,578
the next crop rotation you know until

28
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:34,170
you can grow your own cannabis the law

29
00:01:32,578 --> 00:01:37,078
isn't good enough so I urge you to

30
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:40,290
register to vote get involved in the

31
00:01:37,078 --> 00:01:43,408
political process at takeover you know

32
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:46,170
back to the 60s amp is saying Timothy

33
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:49,170
Leary popularized it with tune in turn

34
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:52,409
on tune in to drop out we need to turn

35
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:55,228
on tune in and take over this political

36
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:56,939
system needs to change you know it's

37
00:01:55,228 --> 00:01:59,908
really the people who brought us

38
00:01:56,938 --> 00:02:03,029
marijuana prohibition where the

39
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:05,759
petrochemical pharmaceutical military it

40
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:06,939
does feel transnational corporate elite

41
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,000
faster

42
00:02:06,939 --> 00:02:12,969
[ __ ] at their one who gave us this

43
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,009
and when we can restore him to its

44
00:02:12,969 --> 00:02:17,169
rightful place in our economy and we

45
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:20,829
grow him without regard to its THC

46
00:02:17,169 --> 00:02:24,189
content because low THC hemp is really

47
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:28,110
[ __ ] it's all about not growing the

48
00:02:24,189 --> 00:02:31,629
seed because we need the seed to replace

49
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:35,170
petrochemicals so get involved in the

50
00:02:31,629 --> 00:02:37,569
political process lobby for him talk to

51
00:02:35,169 --> 00:02:40,689
your political you know representatives

52
00:02:37,569 --> 00:02:45,099
and run for office yourself take over

53
00:02:40,689 --> 00:02:46,689
the process that's what we have to do so

54
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:48,370
I heard you to do that if you don't want

55
00:02:46,689 --> 00:02:52,120
to run yourself supporting somebody who

56
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:55,090
does but it's really about restoring

57
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:57,599
power and control to the people right

58
00:02:55,090 --> 00:03:01,479
now all the money's flowing to these

59
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:03,519
petrochemical Giants and when we take

60
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:06,189
over it could grow hemp for fuel again

61
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:08,320
without regard to its THC content but

62
00:03:06,189 --> 00:03:11,139
according to the types of him that are

63
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:14,919
most productive that means instead of

64
00:03:11,139 --> 00:03:17,889
the money go into these Saudi of kings

65
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:21,219
and Swiss bank accounts it'll go to our

66
00:03:17,889 --> 00:03:23,429
farmers and into our pockets that will

67
00:03:21,219 --> 00:03:26,199
change the whole economic paradigm

68
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:28,900
they're keeping us down as long as they

69
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:32,349
