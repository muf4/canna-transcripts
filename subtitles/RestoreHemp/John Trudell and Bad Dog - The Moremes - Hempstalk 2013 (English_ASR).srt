1
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:17,320
there's me there's the other me there's

2
00:00:14,169 --> 00:00:22,689
another me and then there are the more

3
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:26,320
means we've all got a domino play so we

4
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:29,960
been trying to work it out

5
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:34,250
we don't know how your life burn or what

6
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:37,219
all that means for me in the means we've

7
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:40,058
already seen what we couldn't do and

8
00:00:37,219 --> 00:00:40,058
we're not going back

9
00:00:41,109 --> 00:00:50,950
any skeletons in our closets are our own

10
00:00:46,789 --> 00:00:54,710
private stash of bones there's no screen

11
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:58,160
like the last stream and it's green with

12
00:00:54,710 --> 00:01:01,549
no choice reducing the present is to

13
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:08,239
nothing all eternity is now

14
00:01:01,549 --> 00:01:13,340
not then who is divided into one and how

15
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:17,359
many does that make there's long that

16
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:20,180
lungs there's loves it fears there's

17
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:22,959
love that possesses there's love that

18
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:26,560
needs proof where's the love that lights

19
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:26,559
love that cares

20
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:33,430
Joe's not forgetting some realities

21
00:01:29,849 --> 00:01:36,069
destiny threw at us and faith wasn't

22
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:40,330
much help with this way unloading the

23
00:01:36,069 --> 00:01:43,408
loan it was up to us to carry him you

24
00:01:40,329 --> 00:01:43,408
really have any say

25
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,840
you

26
00:02:21,848 --> 00:02:31,669
in the land where the lie is king using

27
00:02:27,378 --> 00:02:35,479
fear like glue mechanic pretending isn't

28
00:02:31,669 --> 00:02:39,289
pretending each and every one of us I've

29
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:41,869
saw the glory each and every one is what

30
00:02:39,289 --> 00:02:47,329
the boys but we don't like the way we

31
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:53,900
fell and sometimes stray is a way of

32
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:57,079
walking when we can't stay because we've

33
00:02:53,900 --> 00:03:00,200
been accused some things we did is

34
00:02:57,079 --> 00:03:04,000
something we didn't do and we are I

35
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:06,000
forgive you then lied

36
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,520
to be enemies

37
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,610
I've been looking for me they will

38
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:14,510
answer to me and so far there's no one

39
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:14,510
who will

40
00:03:16,389 --> 00:03:23,169
there's me there's the other there's

41
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:27,189
another me

42
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:30,598
and we've all got a domino to play so

43
00:03:27,189 --> 00:03:30,598
we've been trying to work it out
