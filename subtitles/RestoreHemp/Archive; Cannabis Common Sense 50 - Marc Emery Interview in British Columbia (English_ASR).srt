12

name is Paul Stanford and I'm one of the

13
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:04,319
chief petitioners along with our

14
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:07,978
associate Paul Loney here on the Oregon

15
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:10,500
cannabis Tax Act and that is a petition

16
00:01:07,978 --> 00:01:13,079
put out by the campaign for the

17
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:15,780
restoration and regulation of hemp

18
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:17,579
exactly the our political action

19
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,500
committee says it all the campaign for

20
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:22,618
the restoration and regulation of hemp

21
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:26,040
it's a comprehensive initiative which

22
00:01:22,618 --> 00:01:28,438
would regulate marijuana it would allow

23
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,960
sales to adults through state liquor

24
00:01:28,438 --> 00:01:33,839
stores it would allow patie to access

25
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:36,780
medical marijuana at pharmacies at cost

26
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,159
with a prescription from a doctor it

27
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:40,618
would allow our Farmers to grow

28
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,640
industrial hemp which is the low THC

29
00:01:40,618 --> 00:01:44,099
variety

30
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:46,439
and it would provide for some education

31
00:01:44,099 --> 00:01:49,500
on and real drug education programs

32
00:01:46,438 --> 00:01:51,719
exactly it would create thousands of

33
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:54,780
jobs in industrial hemp and it would

34
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:56,340
also bring in hundreds of millions of

35
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:58,140
dollars in state revenue you know we're

36
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:03,240

60
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:04,738

62
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:10,800
a multi-million dollar business hemp BC

63
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:13,620
and the Cannabis Cafe there's also a

64
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,840
hemp BC legal assistance center and a

65
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:17,939
wholesale business and a magazine called

66
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,098
cannabis Canada that's just spectacular

67
00:03:17,939 --> 00:03:22,019
isn't it oh it's a fabulous magazine I

68
00:03:20,098 --> 00:03:24,658
think it's the most comprehensive

69
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:26,700
Magazine on cannabis in the entire world

70
00:03:24,658 --> 00:03:28,560
right now I think so as well and it's

71
00:03:26,699 --> 00:03:31,139
and it's professional oh and it's done

72
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,900
very nicely very nice layout very nice

73
00:03:31,139 --> 00:03:35,339
Graphics photographers are all great the

74
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:37,980
people we met up there were all great

75
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:39,900
and generally they have something that I

76
00:03:37,979 --> 00:03:41,518
personally really like they always have

77
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:44,400
some hemp paper in there some of it's

78
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:46,319
printed on the fibers paper made from

79
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,060
the fibers of the marijuana plant so

80
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:50,939
yeah they're you know putting their

81
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:52,680
money where their mouth is or and so I

82
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:55,079
think it's time to get to the interview

83
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:58,019
get into the interview last the last

84
00:03:55,080 --> 00:04:01,680
plug call us at 235-4606 to get this

85
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:03,840
petition and uh we'll hit Mark Emery's

86
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,480
interview he starts out talking about

87
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,860
some of uh his legal problems since he's

88
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:10,438
come out in the media with the Wall

89
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:13,819
Street Journal and CNN so it starts out

90
00:04:10,438 --> 00:04:13,818
with that and goes into politics

91
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,720
then I would go to jail indefinitely

92
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:20,279
until it comes up a patrol in December

93
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,919
okay

94
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:24,478
so uh so they've got ways of making a

95
00:04:22,918 --> 00:04:25,978
breaking you know if they want to break

96
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:27,899
you they can break you you know and they

97
00:04:25,978 --> 00:04:29,939
rated me twice and they certainly racked

98
00:04:27,899 --> 00:04:31,439
up a pile of debts and cause my assets I

99
00:04:29,939 --> 00:04:32,699
mean I could I that restaurant cost me

100
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:33,959
40 million dollars alone it's probably

101
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:35,400
one of the most famous restaurants in

102
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:36,899
North America but I sold it for about

103
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:38,758
fifty thousand bucks over five years

104
00:04:36,899 --> 00:04:39,779
because nobody will buy a restaurant

105
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:41,340
that doesn't have a business license

106
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:43,918
it's under constant police supervision

107
00:04:41,339 --> 00:04:46,198
for no particular reason mind you

108
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:47,579
um and you know that's you can't

109
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:48,660
liquidate a commodity like that but on

110
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:50,699
the other hand I was given like about 10

111
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:52,259
days to sell so it's like classic Jewish

112
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:53,639
pogrom in Russia you know you're getting

113
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:55,560
three days to get out of town you can

114
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:57,060
sell all your stuff and for whatever you

115
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,280
can get which will be like one you know

116
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:00,780
tenth of its value and you have to

117
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:01,799
liquidate and you're just gone and if

118
00:05:00,779 --> 00:05:03,000
you don't liquidate they just come back

119
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,620
in season anyway like they've already

120
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
done they didn't need any any special

121
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:07,139
permission to raid me twice and they

122
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,339
don't need and they clearly told me we

123
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:13,259
don't need it to do it again so get out

124
00:05:10,339 --> 00:05:14,219
the hand no they came back and said

125
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:15,479
listen we're not even going to wait till

126
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,680
you go to court to contest the license

127
00:05:15,478 --> 00:05:19,740
suspension we'll just come and take all

128
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:21,120
your stuff and so well see if you sell

129
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:22,680
the business and a new license

130
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,538
application they have to be given up to

131
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,918
a year to two years to be tested because

132
00:05:24,538 --> 00:05:27,300
if they don't break the law or they

133
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:29,219
don't appear to be advocating breaking

134
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:30,478
law like I do

135
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:32,580
um then they can't be denied a business

136
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:34,199
license you are protected in some ways

137
00:05:32,579 --> 00:05:35,519
but as a guy who's gone on every major

138
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:37,740
media and said I break the law every day

139
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:39,060
seven different ways to Sunday that's it

140
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:40,620
I've already you know cashed in my

141
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:42,780
ability to go to before a judge and say

142
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:44,280
I'm a good citizen I have a laws I don't

143
00:05:42,779 --> 00:05:46,379
know weight loss it's real clear that I

144
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:48,239
don't obey them I've got 16 counts

145
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:49,379
against me of various things and some of

146
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,460
them are really outrageous all of them

147
00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:52,079
are outrageous they're all related to

148
00:05:50,459 --> 00:05:53,879
this marijuana issue and they're all

149
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:55,258
idiotic I've never solved marijuana

150
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:56,879
never even been accused of selling

151
00:05:55,259 --> 00:05:58,319
marijuana some of them relate to seeds

152
00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:59,879
two of them relate to giving somebody a

153
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:02,099
gift to five dollars worth of hash these

154
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:04,259
are all life sentence uh

155
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:06,240
convictions yeah that's interesting and

156
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:07,439
I've been taken to jail twice for just

157
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,180
giving out brochures on government

158
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:11,038
property legalizing marijuana they

159
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:13,500
handcuffed me and jailed me twice for

160
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:15,300
that I'm charged with assaulting a

161
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,740
police officer but what it is I spit on

162
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:19,199
him when they waited this last time they

163
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:20,579
started beating up my employees and I

164
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,660
was there watching it happen right in

165
00:06:20,579 --> 00:06:22,859
front of me they told me to back up and

166
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:24,000
I spit in the cop's face and they

167
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:26,100
stopped beating on them and beat on me

168
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,240
and threw me in jail overnight so you

169
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,500
know that's how I got that but that was

170
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:31,019
the intention of spitting on the cop

171
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:32,879
anyway right and it was just you know so

172
00:06:31,019 --> 00:06:35,399
uh you know and to me that's a pretty

173
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:36,839
reasonable form of contempt you know a

174
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:38,459
spit on a cop in one of my you know

175
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:39,779
where they're beating uh yeah you know

176
00:06:38,459 --> 00:06:41,279
your boys I mean also what am I supposed

177
00:06:39,779 --> 00:06:42,538
to do in front of my employees anyway I

178
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:44,879
mean was to stand there and let the cop

179
00:06:42,538 --> 00:06:46,500
do it I mean so anyway I chose the most

180
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:47,899
suitable line of resistance that was the

181
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:50,279
least resistance

182
00:06:47,899 --> 00:06:51,359
and uh are there others there must be

183
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:53,099
like oh yes I've got one charger

184
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,038
promoting paraphernalia I've got one

185
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:57,060
charge of selling paraphernalia and you

186
00:06:56,038 --> 00:06:58,500
know so they've kind of got it all

187
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:01,680
covered you know way nine trafficking

188
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:03,180
two paraphernalia uh one literature two

189
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,038
you know so

190
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:07,019
um the other assaulting the cop the

191
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:08,818
usual you know

192
00:07:07,019 --> 00:07:10,680
so including literature he said they got

193
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:12,780
you for yeah no they're not promoting

194
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:14,579
literature giving out brochures because

195
00:07:12,779 --> 00:07:15,599
I'm not I had to get permission and my

196
00:07:14,579 --> 00:07:17,099
understanding was you don't need to get

197
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,479
permission to give up brochures on

198
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,979
government property related to a

199
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:22,019
national issue I had a petition to

200
00:07:19,978 --> 00:07:24,899
Parliament and so they they busted you

201
00:07:22,019 --> 00:07:26,159
for that yeah I refused to move so they

202
00:07:24,899 --> 00:07:27,418
just said well we're just gonna have a

203
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,620
handicap you take away so we'll handcuff

204
00:07:27,418 --> 00:07:30,959
me and take me away and that's what they

205
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:32,038
did right we were at City Hall or no no

206
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:33,418
is that the West End Community Center

207
00:07:32,038 --> 00:07:35,459
which is where I live uh just right

208
00:07:33,418 --> 00:07:38,098
beside the library oh okay yeah so you

209
00:07:35,459 --> 00:07:39,719
know democracy is not necessarily alive

210
00:07:38,098 --> 00:07:41,339
and well and not that it wasn't it's any

211
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,599
good if it is but I mean it's a very

212
00:07:41,339 --> 00:07:45,179
peculiar

213
00:07:42,598 --> 00:07:47,098
Place Canada well it's interesting right

214
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:48,000
now that to to us you know down the

215
00:07:47,098 --> 00:07:49,219
state especially in the Pacific

216
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,180
Northwest part of the United States

217
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:53,120
Vancouver is sort of like a shining

218
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:55,620
Beacon well it is

219
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,598
yeah that's right because basically it's

220
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:58,740
a police state unless you fight back and

221
00:07:57,598 --> 00:08:01,019
then all of a sudden you might find that

222
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:02,699
they give in and they relent and so you

223
00:08:01,019 --> 00:08:04,019
know basically everything we do do is

224
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:05,160
illegal and they didn't bother us they

225
00:08:04,019 --> 00:08:06,839
never bothered us until American

226
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,099
government pressure was put on our

227
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:09,779
police they probably never bothered me

228
00:08:08,098 --> 00:08:11,159
because I'm a good guy you check all my

229
00:08:09,779 --> 00:08:13,079
interviews you check the CNN show they

230
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,759
say nice things about me you check the

231
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:16,439
article that's in Rolling Stone cops say

232
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:17,220
nice things about me they always say

233
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:18,418
nice things about it because there's

234
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:20,160
nothing bad to say about me I'm a

235
00:08:18,418 --> 00:08:21,899
totally upfront honest guy I pay all the

236
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,280
money that everybody's entitled to I

237
00:08:21,899 --> 00:08:24,839
give tens to all the governments my

238
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:26,758
always great to my employees I improve

239
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:28,500
that neighborhood vastly I've you know

240
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:30,000
contributed probably to two million two

241
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,620
billion dollars in economic growth in

242
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,879
British Columbia because marijuana has

243
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:34,679
really gone through the roof has become

244
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:36,360
easily the major crop in this province

245
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:37,379
and you know why because they got a

246
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,418
great promoter they got a great

247
00:08:37,379 --> 00:08:41,099
spokesman in me and where you know when

248
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:42,299
you think of great pot everything's BC

249
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:44,539
I'm sure there's a lot of bogus pot

250
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:44,538
Trading

251
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:51,778
you put say that about a pot people are

252
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:53,639
going to be interested in it you know

253
00:08:51,778 --> 00:08:55,200
and a lot of what's in Portland is from

254
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:56,399
BC though and same with Washington and

255
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,980
certainly California in a bit of

256
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,659
Colorado Idaho and that sort of thing

257
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:01,860
but uh and it made me a low figure to

258
00:09:00,659 --> 00:09:03,299
say it's four billion dollars in

259
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:05,580
production every year out of British

260
00:09:03,299 --> 00:09:06,958
Columbia loan but you know I certainly I

261
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:08,639
take a lot of credit for that because we

262
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:10,319
have made British Columbia famous and

263
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:12,000
it's all good so it's easy to promote

264
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,560
but at the same time you know there was

265
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,360
nobody before I existed like nothing

266
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:17,518
absolutely there was no infrastructure

267
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,080
there weren't 40 50 hemp stores you see

268
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:21,000
now or hemp symposiums being held down

269
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:22,500
the street you know at the Pan Pacific

270
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,759
Center there's none of that going on

271
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,500
before we came by and now there's

272
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:27,659
hundreds of hamsters and a couple

273
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:29,159
magazines and lots of you know just lots

274
00:09:27,659 --> 00:09:30,719
of activity in Canada there's tons of

275
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:32,338
activity

276
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,540
and we subsidize everything in the time

277
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:35,220
in the period when I could you know we

278
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:37,500
gave easily last year a hundred thousand

279
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:40,259
dollars and money and free legal help to

280
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:41,458
everybody to everybody everybody so you

281
00:09:40,259 --> 00:09:43,200
know but the police knew that that's why

282
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:44,458
they attacked us because they wanted to

283
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,620
damage us financially because that money

284
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:48,958
was subsidizing the whole war against

285
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:50,278
the drug war right

286
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:51,719
so we sold three and a half million

287
00:09:50,278 --> 00:09:54,059
dollars and I recirculated all of it but

288
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:56,220
the 80 000 I keep so that's a lot of

289
00:09:54,059 --> 00:09:58,500
money to turn back into you know our our

290
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:59,639
information campaign really and we got a

291
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,019
lot of interviews I mean we've been in

292
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:03,059
everything my three proudest ones are

293
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:05,820
the worldwide CNN broadcast which has

294
00:10:03,059 --> 00:10:07,379
been aired three times now and uh that's

295
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:09,240
the impact the impact show yeah which

296
00:10:07,379 --> 00:10:12,419
was fabulous that's on our website too

297
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:14,399
yeah and the uh the Wall Street Journal

298
00:10:12,419 --> 00:10:15,479
front page on December 5th 1995 I'm

299
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,278
really proud of that one that was great

300
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:19,440
they had five editors go through every

301
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:20,879
aspect of my life you could do because

302
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,320
they weren't going to be oh they said

303
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:23,939
they were not going to put a drug dealer

304
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,320
with any negative connections on the

305
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:27,240
front page if there's anything that came

306
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,260
up like any single thing and they

307
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,759
couldn't find anybody to say anything

308
00:10:28,259 --> 00:10:31,500
about it maybe if I'm not from a cop to

309
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:33,539
my old teachers to any employees to

310
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,980
anybody could not find a negative

311
00:10:33,539 --> 00:10:36,199
comment we couldn't go we went to my

312
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:38,459
neighbors couldn't find anybody there

313
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,540
and so they put me on the front page and

314
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:40,979
the only thing on the front page I

315
00:10:39,539 --> 00:10:42,480
didn't like face there that's a

316
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:44,100
beautiful article

317
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,659
um and the Rolling Stone article which

318
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,500
is really nice because it goes to a

319
00:10:45,659 --> 00:10:48,659
different Market they're all different

320
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:51,179
markets you know CNN Wall Street Journal

321
00:10:48,659 --> 00:10:52,860
rolling and you know so now that I've

322
00:10:51,179 --> 00:10:54,419
been sort of kicked out and forced into

323
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:55,919
some degree of retirement I feel at

324
00:10:54,419 --> 00:10:57,539
least we've accomplished a lot in that

325
00:10:55,919 --> 00:11:00,120
period like we certainly set the ball

326
00:10:57,539 --> 00:11:01,740
for a lot of people to do stuff so what

327
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:03,120
are you um what businesses do you still

328
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:05,159
have now oh we have cannabis Canada

329
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,720
where we're filming right now and we

330
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:08,278
still do mail order cannabis candidates

331
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,320
and we still sell bongs and pipes and

332
00:11:08,278 --> 00:11:13,620
magazines and books and seats by mail

333
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:15,480
okay and uh but you know the retail

334
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:17,039
outlets were the real cash cows you know

335
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:19,139
we sold we used to sell

336
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:21,480
five six thousand dollars worth of seeds

337
00:11:19,139 --> 00:11:23,939
a day there and four thousand dollars in

338
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:25,440
the NPC store and the caffeine ever does

339
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:27,180
too much like a thousand dollars a day

340
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,140
there but you know that's now that's

341
00:11:27,179 --> 00:11:29,699
they've got to pay for their people

342
00:11:28,139 --> 00:11:32,039
because those those places now still

343
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:33,420
having about 22 employees so you know

344
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:34,980
their money gets turned back into the

345
00:11:33,419 --> 00:11:36,838
suppliers and the employees is basically

346
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:38,399
the same thing it's the one we protected

347
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:40,680
as many jobs as we can we still have

348
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:43,559
about 31 people in the NPC family

349
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:45,479
whereas we had 43 on at the end of

350
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:46,679
January we had to let go anybody who

351
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,240
really couldn't

352
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:49,559
couldn't be justified financially

353
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,200
anymore and the legal services aren't

354
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:53,879
free anymore now so because we lost all

355
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,200
our you know most of our sources of

356
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:57,120
revenue so you know all the freebies

357
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,560
I've been and we we sponsored cannabis

358
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,299
Nation radio out which is a weekly radio

359
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:02,219
show for our Coastal College Canada we

360
00:12:00,299 --> 00:12:04,559

361
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:06,000
everybody's Legal Services at the law

362
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:07,739
office and whenever people never charge

363
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,120
for that that was easy a hundred

364
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:10,740
thousand dollars a year for that one you

365
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,240
know we subsidized tons of stuff most

366
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:13,139
hamsters and Canada receive money from

367
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,639
us

368
00:12:13,139 --> 00:12:16,259
Etc et cetera which we can't do anymore

369
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,699
yeah and the police you know that was

370
00:12:16,259 --> 00:12:19,019
the intent of this whole thing sounds

371
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,220
like is you know like they're saying

372
00:12:19,019 --> 00:12:21,899
like why are you letting this guy you

373
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:23,459
know he uses his money very efficient is

374
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:25,559

375
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:27,179
Whack Him you know get him out I mean

376

00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:30,299
leaders were here we bought full page

378
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:32,219
ads and all the daily papers those are

379
00:12:30,299 --> 00:12:33,719
great ads have you ever seen them uh I

380
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:36,060
there's one in the cafe actually on the

381
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:38,339
table take a look at that full page ad

there yeah I heard about it okay can you

383
00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:44,100
describe it I was doing it yeah

384
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:45,660
nobody was here and now that this issue

385
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:47,579
of the newspaper that we bought an ad in

386
00:12:45,659 --> 00:12:49,799
was really a corporate suck up section

387
00:12:47,578 --> 00:12:51,479
it was all about Apex so that Apec

388
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:53,519
leaders could read about themselves and

389
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:55,860
everybody at Apec and then all the ads

390
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:58,440
were like BC tell FedEx you know full

391
00:12:55,860 --> 00:13:00,120
page corporate advertising and no one

392
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:01,740
expected us to take advantage of we got

393
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,480
it in the mail automatically as a

394
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:05,339
routine thing and we said we'll buy full

395
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:07,560
page ads in all in all the daily papers

396
00:13:05,339 --> 00:13:09,120
that day and so we had to when the big

397
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:11,578
headlines it was time to end the war on

398
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,679
marijuana and then it's got the Cannabis

399
00:13:11,578 --> 00:13:15,359
culture of Canada welcomes Apec leaders

400
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:17,399
and delegates to the world the North

401
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,200
America's marijuana Bread Basket British

402
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:20,700
Columbia and a headline and I'm just

403
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,379
thinking there must have been a half you

404
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:24,000
know a lot of big Canadian guys who just

405
00:13:22,379 --> 00:13:24,838
really had a heart attack when they were

406
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,820
like because you know the guys from

407
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:28,980
Malaysia and Singapore are going we kill

408
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:30,060
people like right yeah and they said

409
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:31,500
come and have a smoke with us four

410
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:33,000
blocks away because it was only four

411
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,200
blocks away from the Pan Pacific so I

412
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,419
invited all the leaders to come down and

413
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,920
have a 10 talk with me and check it out

414
00:13:36,419 --> 00:13:39,539
and discuss why they still think

415
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:41,519
marijuana should be illegal if they're

416
00:13:39,539 --> 00:13:42,899
so concerned and and basically we also

417
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,459
cited the human rights record of each

418
00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:46,860
country would go that you know marijuana

419
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:48,719
Traders are executed in China Singapore

420
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:50,579
Malaysia in the United States 640 000

421
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,320
people are put in jail blah blah blah

422
00:13:50,578 --> 00:13:54,299
George Washington Thomas Jefferson's you

423
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,740
know sowed him and Bill Clinton wants to

424
00:13:54,299 --> 00:13:58,019
put everybody in jail that does so today

425
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:59,278
and you know and we made fun of the fact

426
00:13:58,019 --> 00:14:01,078
that America still calls itself a

427
00:13:59,278 --> 00:14:03,240
pluralistic democracy in the land of the

428
00:14:01,078 --> 00:14:04,620
free while locking up everybody in sight

429
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:06,200
who doesn't agree with you know the

430
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:08,759
president's point of view on marijuana

431
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:10,320
and uh basically tried to shame and

432
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:11,578
embarrass them and pointed that we're

433
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,899
decent people we're your leaders were

434
00:14:11,578 --> 00:14:14,819
your children were your teachers were

435
00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:16,200
your uncles we're the kid next door or

436
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,459
the people who sell you stuff or the

437
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,920
people who work with you et cetera et

438
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:21,539
cetera and that it was idiotic Advocate

439
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:23,578
any kind of policy that put us in jail

440
00:14:21,539 --> 00:14:24,778
as well as which it was good medicine we

441
00:14:23,578 --> 00:14:27,239
listed off it was good medicine it's

442
00:14:24,778 --> 00:14:28,439
great for fiber you know and it's a

443
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,579
wonderfully articulate beautiful thing

444
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,260

have the nerve to come in and I think

451

back yeah and one of the things that I'm

481
00:15:55,139 --> 00:15:59,639
excited about with our initiative on the

482
00:15:57,539 --> 00:16:02,159
medical aspect of it that allows the

483
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:04,500
doctor and patients to decide what to

484
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:06,480
use marijuana for what to use cannabis

485
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:08,278
for some of the other initiatives going

486
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,680
around the country there's like a set

487
00:16:08,278 --> 00:16:12,600
list of what a doctor can say it's good

488
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:14,698
for and if you know if not on the list

489
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,560
well you're out of luck but not ours

490
00:16:14,698 --> 00:16:17,838
it's between a doctor and a patient the

491
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:20,778
way it should be

492
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:24,360
in Pure Freedom

493
00:16:20,778 --> 00:16:27,179
no prohibitions no regulations on

494
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:30,000
doctors or on patients so give us a call

495
00:16:27,179 --> 00:16:31,799
and help us out send back petitions if

496
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,379
you've already got them so we need them

497
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:36,000
now time's going short or call us if you

498
00:16:34,379 --> 00:16:38,360
haven't petition yet or if you lost

499
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,958
yours that's

500
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:44,759
235-4606 and help us make it legal here

501
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:48,000
and maybe we can Mark invite Mark Emery

502
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:49,680
down here once it's legal and he can the

503
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,240
greatest marijuana smoker in North

504
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:52,379
America he's called or the world this

505
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:54,480
day I guess that's what some of the

506
00:16:52,379 --> 00:16:56,759
media is calling him yeah the world's

507
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:59,039
greatest marijuana smoker well you know

508
00:16:56,759 --> 00:17:01,560
we can we can have them down here

509
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:03,240
um once we change those laws because he

510
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:04,859
doesn't want to come down here while

511
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:06,480
there's a lot more freedom up there

512
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:09,178
there's no sense in him coming down here

513
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:11,818
and facing the wrath of uh the federal

514
00:17:09,179 --> 00:17:13,880
fascist state so call us and get these

515
00:17:11,818 --> 00:17:17,399
petitions at

516
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:19,380
235-4606 and now I guess we're back to

517
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:23,240
uh the conclusion of the mark Emery

518
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:23,240
interview back with the politics part

519
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,798
and so that was pretty good yeah we got

520
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:30,419
a lot but what was really important and

521
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:31,759
this was really hurt us later I know the

522
00:17:30,419 --> 00:17:33,540
ads got

523
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:35,759
re-reported all of the world New York

524
00:17:33,539 --> 00:17:37,558
Times picked it up a lot of American

525
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:39,839
Press picked up European television film

526
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:41,819
to the Cannabis Cafe Reuters came in and

527
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:43,439
we got calls from France and Germany

528
00:17:41,819 --> 00:17:45,418
said they'd seen us there interviewed

529
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,100
and then we got very syndicated

530
00:17:45,419 --> 00:17:49,200
magazines and so it kept going outward

531
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:50,399
like that daily newspapers would comment

532
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,900
because the thing is the great thing is

533
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,000
the newspaper was delivered during a

534
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:55,500
boring news day as well so there was

535
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,119
endless people commenting on this

536
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,980
incredibly cool ad and they would read

537
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:01,199
it aloud and stuff like that and so you

538
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:02,519
know it it it it it got everything I

539
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,558
wanted to get out of it but the problem

540
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:05,940
is I knew there would be a consequence

541
00:18:04,558 --> 00:18:07,678
yeah maybe a repercussion I remember

542
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:09,058
when CNN was here and they just wrapped

543
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:09,960
up and the last question they said so do

544
00:18:09,058 --> 00:18:11,879
you think there'll be any negative

545
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:13,019
repercussions to you being on this show

546
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:15,240
and I looked at the guy real up close

547
00:18:13,019 --> 00:18:17,519
and I said well don't you I mean of

548
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:22,380
course I do I said it's probably the end

549
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:24,058
I said but it's a good way to go yeah so

550
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:26,700
well you're still doing cannabis Canada

551
00:18:24,058 --> 00:18:28,500
and oh yeah it's stable too it's not in

552
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:30,360
any danger or anything like that it was

553
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,679
three weeks ago when after we were

554
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:33,058
forced out of our retail business our

555
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,380
printer demanded all the money for the

556
00:18:33,058 --> 00:18:36,538
last issue and a half of this month's

557
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:38,160
right up front now you know okay and we

558
00:18:36,538 --> 00:18:39,359
found it for him so that's so at least

559
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,340
we're really caught up we've never been

560
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:42,899
as well you know as well caught up in

561
00:18:41,339 --> 00:18:45,418
cannabis Canada as we are right now so

562
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:46,740
it's stable here but you know there's

563
00:18:45,419 --> 00:18:48,840
you know I'm not involved in really

564
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:51,120
anything else at the moment other than I

565
00:18:48,839 --> 00:18:52,439
give a lot of interviews and you know

566
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:54,298
I'm still you know when you won an

567
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:55,980
interview about pot and you want it to

568
00:18:54,298 --> 00:18:57,720
be favorable you're going to call me up

569
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:59,279
because you just have to quote me and

570
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:01,259
most journalists are in favor of

571
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:02,279
marijuana legalization so by calling me

572
00:19:01,259 --> 00:19:03,960
you know you're going to get what you

573
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:05,879
want because they've been suitably

574
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:07,860
propagandized now so they know what to

575
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:09,120
promote too so most journalists are

576
00:19:07,859 --> 00:19:10,139
getting good at it they know what they

577
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:11,099
want so they call me up because they

578
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:12,900
know they're going to get great quotes

579
00:19:11,099 --> 00:19:14,219
you know and I convince people I

580
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:16,440
literally convince people like I mean

581
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:18,360
the climate has gone from 39 of Canada

582
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:20,340
one in legalization only three years ago

583
00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:21,839
four years ago and now 51 percent of the

584
00:19:20,339 --> 00:19:23,759
country runs legalization and in British

585
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:25,259
Columbia went way off the scale 63

586
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:27,298
percent you know so that means you've

587
00:19:25,259 --> 00:19:29,819
got 33 that either said they were

588
00:19:27,298 --> 00:19:31,558
against marijuana or didn't have an

589
00:19:29,819 --> 00:19:33,538
opinion or anything well where you got

590
00:19:31,558 --> 00:19:35,519
63 are willing to say yes conclusive but

591
00:19:33,538 --> 00:19:38,460
I want marijuana legalize so you have a

592
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:39,960
much more hardcore pro-marijuana segment

593
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:41,579
of our society than you have anybody who

594
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,840
cares about making it illegal in other

595
00:19:41,579 --> 00:19:44,279
words the people who are against it are

596
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:46,619
ambivalent at best they don't care

597
00:19:44,279 --> 00:19:48,119
really that doesn't concern them you

598
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:49,859
know maybe there's teenage son took

599
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:51,000
smoke marijuana they didn't like how he

600
00:19:49,859 --> 00:19:52,798
turned out so since then they're against

601
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,599
marijuana that tends to be the commonest

602
00:19:52,798 --> 00:19:56,038
kind of reason to be against any kind of

603
00:19:54,599 --> 00:19:58,079
drug that I've ever heard is not because

604
00:19:56,038 --> 00:19:59,400
in and of itself prohibition works it's

605
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:00,839
just that I didn't like my kid doing it

606
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,580
so I don't want him to ever see it again

607
00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:03,720
blah blah or whatever and therefore it

608
00:20:02,579 --> 00:20:05,819
should be illegal these are always

609
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,900
irrational nonsensical people and when

610
00:20:05,819 --> 00:20:08,460
you look at the people in favor of

611
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,660
prohibition they're always total idiots

612
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:10,798
it's like when people look at white

613
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:12,000
supremacists why are you worried about

614
00:20:10,798 --> 00:20:13,619
white supremacists I said they're all

615
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,119
mongoloids they look at these people

616
00:20:13,619 --> 00:20:16,619
they're not the master races are people

617
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:18,359
that couldn't get accepted in the lowest

618
00:20:16,619 --> 00:20:19,859
Social Club you know they've shamed

619
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:21,298
heads you know a little off to the side

620
00:20:19,859 --> 00:20:22,678
like a little you know Egghead type

621
00:20:21,298 --> 00:20:24,179
things you know wearing bizarre things

622
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:25,440
out in Montana that's the best [ __ ]

623
00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:27,000
place for those people let's isolate

624
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,440
them let's send them to Montana I don't

625
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,880
hope they never show up for the rest of

626
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:32,580
us right that's what you want to do with

627
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:34,080
those people right so I mean most most

628
00:20:32,579 --> 00:20:35,759
times people get worked up over nothing

629
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:38,720
and they ignore all the real problems in

630
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:38,720
life that's what I found

631
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:44,038
so do you have any uh what's your vision

632
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:45,600
of the future of the magazine and yeah

633
00:20:44,038 --> 00:20:47,279
well we're going to put out more

634
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:49,558
magazines we have a pot puzzle book

635
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:51,660
coming out that's lots of fun and

636
00:20:49,558 --> 00:20:53,579
cannabis Canada will issue like Avalon

637
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:54,720
Sunsplash the holding company which I'm

638
00:20:53,579 --> 00:20:56,099
the president

639
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,019
um we'll put out more magazines of

640
00:20:56,099 --> 00:20:59,519
different subject matters we just go we

641
00:20:58,019 --> 00:21:00,720
have to like diversify we're still going

642
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:03,599
to handle the mail order here and

643
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:05,038
that'll expand in this department and uh

644
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:06,298
but we'll just go a little slower I mean

645
00:21:05,038 --> 00:21:07,440
after all the other things are well in

646
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:09,179
place and other people can look after

647
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,038
those and I've also got to pay a hundred

648
00:21:09,179 --> 00:21:12,480
thousand dollars in debts because I pass

649
00:21:11,038 --> 00:21:14,279
on the businesses in a debt-free

650
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,839
environment no money down debt free that

651
00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:17,639
way you know I know you'll be successful

652
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:18,720
but I got stuck with debt so I have to

653
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:20,640
pay down about a hundred thousand

654
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,200
dollars to suppliers so you know they'll

655
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,179
get it in the next two months you know

656
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,740
and so then we'll consider new projects

657
00:21:24,179 --> 00:21:27,419
at that point in time but right now I'm

658
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:29,640
in businessman mode paying off the old

659
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:30,780
debts okay you know and oh well when I

660
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:32,340
say business memory I still give like

661
00:21:30,779 --> 00:21:34,558
five to ten interviews a day of that

662
00:21:32,339 --> 00:21:35,639
kind so like like on Saturday we're on

663
00:21:34,558 --> 00:21:37,019
the front page of the London Free Press

664
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,880
the cafe was on the front page of the

665
00:21:37,019 --> 00:21:41,220
Toronto Star on the same day last last

666
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,960
Thursday that was a full page article on

667
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:44,640
me in the daily paper this Sunday I've

668
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,319
got another article coming up later on

669
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,720
this week in the Vancouver Sun this

670
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:50,099
Magazine's writing an article on me I

671
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,659
mean it's the Saturday night magazine I

672
00:21:50,099 --> 00:21:53,579
got radio shows you know blah blah blah

673
00:21:51,659 --> 00:21:54,840
there's tons of them right so like great

674
00:21:53,579 --> 00:21:56,279
the great thing about being a CNN

675
00:21:54,839 --> 00:21:57,779
Rolling Stone and the Wall Street

676
00:21:56,279 --> 00:22:00,298
Journal is hey you can't those are the a

677
00:21:57,779 --> 00:22:01,798
list that's it that's true AAA list when

678
00:22:00,298 --> 00:22:03,960
you've been acknowledged by those in the

679
00:22:01,798 --> 00:22:06,298
60 Minutes calls ABC News oh I got an

680
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:07,558
ABC News special coming out in April one

681
00:22:06,298 --> 00:22:09,658
hour special called victims of

682
00:22:07,558 --> 00:22:10,558
victimless crime oh really and yeah and

683
00:22:09,659 --> 00:22:11,880
that'll probably get more trouble

684
00:22:10,558 --> 00:22:13,079
because what I do is I go to a grow

685
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:15,240
operation here where the guy's got a

686
00:22:13,079 --> 00:22:16,859
thousand plants in this house and then

687
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:18,298
they asked me to describe what's going

688
00:22:16,859 --> 00:22:19,798
on then they say what would a guy get if

689
00:22:18,298 --> 00:22:20,940
you were caught in very spicy United

690
00:22:19,798 --> 00:22:22,500
States I said well starting with

691
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:27,000
Oklahoma you'd get 50 to 100 years

692
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:28,679
minimum in Florida Texas Arkansas uh and

693
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,819
and then listed off about seven or eight

694
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:34,019
others you'd get 25 years and I said

695
00:22:32,819 --> 00:22:35,399
about 20 other states you get 10 years

696
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:36,658
and every other state in the America I

697
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,640
said because a thousand plants is

698
00:22:36,659 --> 00:22:40,260
definitely Federal I said you're going

699
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,759
to get minimum mandatory we were five

700
00:22:40,259 --> 00:22:43,500
years absolutely without question likely

701
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:45,720
10 to 15 I said this guy would get two

702
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:49,579
thousand dollar fine if that since he's

703
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:52,620
an invalid uh B get less maybe

704
00:22:49,579 --> 00:22:54,058
and she's disabled so you know they

705
00:22:52,619 --> 00:22:55,439
probably would say who cares you know

706
00:22:54,058 --> 00:22:57,119
like I mean basically the judge say who

707
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,679
cares anyway unless you're there for the

708
00:22:57,119 --> 00:23:01,079
tenth time like I'm going to be before

709
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:03,538
some judges with quite a rap sheet so it

710
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:05,099
looks it's worse for me because they're

711
00:23:03,538 --> 00:23:06,839
you know they piled the charges on to

712
00:23:05,099 --> 00:23:08,759
make it look bad so they you know they

713
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:11,038
can start and the police have to from

714
00:23:08,759 --> 00:23:12,599
their perspective of fighting a war you

715
00:23:11,038 --> 00:23:13,980
know it's like you know the enemy

716
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:15,178
General's right over there we could kill

717
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:16,860
him but that would cause more trouble

718
00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:18,720
than it's worth so we have to hassle him

719
00:23:16,859 --> 00:23:21,000
and you know a number of things to keep

720
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,919
me to marginalize or disable my

721
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,839
Effectiveness and if you have to go into

722
00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:26,280
court all the time and show oh well no

723
00:23:24,839 --> 00:23:28,259
it soaks up all my money I'll never have

724
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:29,579
any spare money to buy full page ads I

725
00:23:28,259 --> 00:23:31,259
won't be able to start any businesses

726
00:23:29,579 --> 00:23:33,000
and they know that right so it's their

727
00:23:31,259 --> 00:23:35,339
way of waging more but you know there's

728
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,319
a there's a a couple of lines I often

729
00:23:35,339 --> 00:23:40,079
use I said you know it's good to be

730
00:23:37,319 --> 00:23:41,879
underestimated for one they never knew

731
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:43,139
how good I really was at this until it

732
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:44,520
was too late that's what I liked about

733
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:45,780
that you know they think well how much

734
00:23:44,519 --> 00:23:47,839
trouble could he be he's got one of him

735
00:23:45,779 --> 00:23:50,460
so four years later oh [ __ ]

736
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:51,779
why didn't we just beat him up and throw

737
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:54,600
him in an alley when we had the chance

738
00:23:51,779 --> 00:23:55,798
you know and uh so now they're stuck

739
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:57,119
with me and they've got to play ball

740
00:23:55,798 --> 00:23:59,000
because I'm actually one of the most

741
00:23:57,119 --> 00:24:01,319
well-known people from British Columbia

742
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,538
we've attracted tons of money that

743
00:24:01,319 --> 00:24:05,519
nobody really wants to turn away and I'm

744
00:24:03,538 --> 00:24:06,779
really good at what I say I mean I'm I'm

745
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:08,519
the kind of person you everybody could

746
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:10,619
be proud of you I'm BC he's proud of me

747
00:24:08,519 --> 00:24:12,480
because I make BC sound good I make PC

748
00:24:10,619 --> 00:24:14,699
sound tolerant pod smokers are proud of

749
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,140
me because I look so dignified and and I

750
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:17,759
don't look like a typical hippie I'm an

751
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:19,200
employed person with children like

752
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:21,119
concerns like every other middle class

753
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,340
person and you know the cops like me

754
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:25,019
because I you know I'm polite not a

755
00:24:23,339 --> 00:24:26,339
problem you know type of thing only if

756
00:24:25,019 --> 00:24:27,839
they're beating up your employees no

757
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:29,220
even then you beat up your employees and

758
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:30,839
for me and all I do is spit on you you

759
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:32,279
could be thankful you know I mean if I

760
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:34,798
was an American maybe I'd have a gun or

761
00:24:32,279 --> 00:24:37,200
something you know I mean pod smokers in

762
00:24:34,798 --> 00:24:38,460
Canada or surprisingly docile passive

763
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,380
people they're peace lovers I mean

764
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:41,700
they're not prone to fighting so it's

765
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:43,919
not surprising that we're one-way

766
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:45,058
victims in this drug war but the fact is

767
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:48,960
you know we're winning while being

768
00:24:45,058 --> 00:24:50,099
abused and and and hurt and and so you

769
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,019
know there's truth sooner or later

770
00:24:50,099 --> 00:24:53,459
people realize the Injustice situation

771
00:24:52,019 --> 00:24:55,139
but they're very slow to act and they're

772
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:56,880
very cowardly and people value money and

773
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:58,679
comfort above freedom and of course

774
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,720
ironically they'll lose that too if they

775
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:02,280
don't pay attention to freedom but the

776
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,259
thing is it takes a long time you know

777
00:25:02,279 --> 00:25:06,000
in four years we've just made dramatic

778
00:25:04,259 --> 00:25:08,099
rapid progress you know to me it's not

779
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,720
fast enough but it's been pretty good

780
00:25:08,099 --> 00:25:12,240
you know I mean we have without

781
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:13,440
government subsidy it made marijuana at

782
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,779
a bridge probably the best in the world

783
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:18,840
we it's the cheapest in North America

784
00:25:15,779 --> 00:25:20,339
it's the highest quality we've increased

785
00:25:18,839 --> 00:25:21,980
production by about three or four times

786
00:25:20,339 --> 00:25:25,259
in the last four years

787
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:27,179
and uh you know it's perfect it's a

788
00:25:25,259 --> 00:25:30,058
perfect economy you know you start off

789
00:25:27,179 --> 00:25:31,860
with [ __ ] some seeds some water and

790
00:25:30,058 --> 00:25:33,720
the natural Sun basically a very small

791
00:25:31,859 --> 00:25:35,158
investment and three months later some

792
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:38,038
Americans giving you a big wad of money

793
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:40,559
he goes and takes this marijuana and

794
00:25:38,038 --> 00:25:41,819
he burns it which is incredible he burns

795
00:25:40,558 --> 00:25:43,678
and he has to come back for more at

796
00:25:41,819 --> 00:25:45,599
least when people buy a car that car is

797
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:47,340
going to last five years anyway that pot

798
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:48,778
doesn't last two weeks it's gone it's

799
00:25:47,339 --> 00:25:50,278
burned it's been destroyed and they've

800
00:25:48,778 --> 00:25:52,019
got to come back for more now that is a

801
00:25:50,278 --> 00:25:53,640
perfect economy from water [ __ ] and

802
00:25:52,019 --> 00:25:54,900
a bit of time you come up with a

803
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:56,038
multi-billion dollar industry where

804
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:58,259
everybody's happy

805
00:25:56,038 --> 00:25:59,339
you know and so the the fact that as

806
00:25:58,259 --> 00:26:01,259
taxpayer

807
00:25:59,339 --> 00:26:03,178
all right once again this interview has

808
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:04,980
been brought to you by the campaign for

809
00:26:03,179 --> 00:26:06,298
the restoration restoration regulation

810
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:07,919
of hemp

811
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:10,500
um the sponsors of our initiative Drive

812
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:12,360
the Oregon cannabis tax act so we can

813
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:14,038
have it here in Oregon that same

814
00:26:12,359 --> 00:26:16,619
turnaround as Mark said two weeks they

815
00:26:14,038 --> 00:26:18,000
