14
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,500
long wonderful tradition with marijuana

15
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:41,910
on the east coast but really in the last

16
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:45,149
couple of years we've seen a whirlwind

17
00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:47,609
of reform activity on the East Coast we

18
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:49,230
are bound to the legislative process we

19
00:00:47,609 --> 00:00:51,539
do not have a ballot initiative process

20
00:00:49,229 --> 00:00:53,609
that we can employ to change law or

21
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:55,620
bring up new law but I'll tell you what

22
00:00:53,609 --> 00:00:57,210
this year we've seen something really

23
00:00:55,619 --> 00:00:59,519
revolutionary happened in Philadelphia

24
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:01,198

25
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,730

26
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:04,618

to tell you and we're getting to this in

34
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:19,319
just a second New Jersey is about to run

35
00:01:17,459 --> 00:01:20,789
a revolution on medical marijuana and

36
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:23,309
it's not a revolution any of us are

37
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:24,930
going to be real happy with you know

38

39
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:28,920
good stuff first right here on the

40
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:31,290
screen you will see the july issue of

41
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:34,409
philadelphia magazine they interviewed

42
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:35,909
women for the pot is back now all of us

43
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:38,219
are saying well where did pot go it

44
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:40,109
didn't go on vacation you know pots

45
00:01:38,219 --> 00:01:42,000
always been around but it looks like the

46
00:01:40,109 --> 00:01:43,618
media in Philadelphia in new york and

47
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,629
new jersey are just finally starting to

48
00:01:43,618 --> 00:01:47,399
wake up with to the fact that they can

49
00:01:45,629 --> 00:01:49,530
cover this that this is an issue that

50
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:51,118
isn't just in california this is an

51
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:53,159
issue that exists around them every day

52
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:56,489
what Philadelphia Magazine went out and

53
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:58,740
did was interview yuppies smoking pot on

54
00:01:56,489 --> 00:02:02,489
the main line in Philadelphia after work

55
00:01:58,739 --> 00:02:04,589
bankers a lot of women I hate to use the

56
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:07,140
term but sort of this the Stiletto

57
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:09,539
stoner kind of an interview is what this

58
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:11,280
turned into be myself and state senator

59
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:13,899
daylin leach were the only people quoted

60
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,969
with our real name in what was a long

61
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:18,039
feature length article here they also

62
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:19,900
sampled the local marijuana in

63
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:22,479
Philadelphia and did a write-up of that

64
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:24,459
which was good stuff but this was an

65
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:25,689
innovation I'll tell ya and it wasn't

66
00:02:24,459 --> 00:02:27,759
very savvy the guy starts out the

67
00:02:25,689 --> 00:02:29,770
article and he says I'm a cop but I can

68
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:31,389
get you know I look like a cop but I can

69
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:33,459
get great marijuana around Philadelphia

70
00:02:31,389 --> 00:02:34,958
well I'm here to tell you if you don't

71
00:02:33,459 --> 00:02:38,550
look like a cop you can get even better

72
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:40,599
marijuana around Philadelphia so

73
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:41,860
you know and actually it was the

74
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:43,269
Philadelphia Police that we worked

75
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:45,100
really closely with this year and I have

76
00:02:43,269 --> 00:02:46,480
to thank Harry Levine for his support

77
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:48,189
you know we pointed out the racial

78
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:49,268
disparity on the arrests in Philadelphia

79
00:02:48,189 --> 00:02:51,549
this year in the city responded

80
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:53,349
positively to this is the first sign

81
00:02:51,549 --> 00:02:55,209
that really reached out to municipal

82
00:02:53,349 --> 00:02:57,549
government and they sort of reached out

83
00:02:55,209 --> 00:02:59,289
back to us and had a change so let's

84
00:02:57,549 --> 00:03:01,060
talk a little bit about that pot is back

85
00:02:59,289 --> 00:03:03,129
in Philadelphia New Jersey folks as you

86
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:04,689
can see on this magazine here New Jersey

87
00:03:03,129 --> 00:03:06,039
passed a medical marijuana law that's

88
00:03:04,689 --> 00:03:09,099
right there at the Statehouse that's our

89
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:10,449
senators Nicholas qatari of New Jersey I

90
00:03:09,099 --> 00:03:12,459
had just had a meeting with him a couple

91
00:03:10,449 --> 00:03:16,298
of weeks ago New Jersey has a new

92
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:18,400
resolution right now to support HR 28 35

93
00:03:16,299 --> 00:03:21,040
New Jersey could be the first state to

94
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,959
so to pass a resolution to support the

95
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:24,759
federal medical marijuana patient

96
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,829
protection act of course it's sponsored

97
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:28,959
by Barney Frank he's a New Jersey boy he

98
00:03:26,829 --> 00:03:30,579
was born in Bayonne we're in touch with

99
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,469
Congressman Frank to do some appearances

100
00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:34,629
in New Jersey about the new resolution

101
00:03:32,469 --> 00:03:36,099
that's the good news the bad news is we

102
00:03:34,629 --> 00:03:37,509
passed a medical marijuana law this year

103
00:03:36,099 --> 00:03:40,419
that is the most restrictive in the

104
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:41,679
nation and in implementing this law we

105
00:03:40,419 --> 00:03:44,679
are up against one of the biggest

106
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:47,379
hurdles i have seen in the marijuana

107
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:49,060
movement thus far New Jersey is a unique

108
00:03:47,379 --> 00:03:51,159
place to have a medical marijuana law

109
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:52,930
pass it is where four of the seven

110
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:54,849
largest pharmaceutical companies in the

111
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:57,640
world are based it is a state that has

112
00:03:54,849 --> 00:04:00,099
unique state regulations that exist for

113
00:03:57,639 --> 00:04:01,929
this medical and pharmaceutical industry

114
00:04:00,099 --> 00:04:03,519
in order to work with the state and

115
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:05,230
these entities and the universities and

116
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,310
everything like that you might have

117
00:04:05,229 --> 00:04:08,649
heard that they were going to give a

118
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:10,780
monopoly production contract to Rutgers

119
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:12,909
University this year but it wasn't

120
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:15,099
really just Rutgers University it was

121
00:04:12,909 --> 00:04:16,889
Rutgers University and a couple of small

122
00:04:15,099 --> 00:04:19,329
companies that already work on

123
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:21,158
plant-based pharmaceuticals through

124
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:23,079
clinical trials and they were really

125
00:04:21,158 --> 00:04:25,060
going to try this and what's going to be

126
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:26,560
next for New Jersey there were looking

127
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:28,389
on the implementation of the medical

128
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,550
marijuana law they are proposing that

129
00:04:28,389 --> 00:04:32,709
six alternative treatment centers serve

130
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:34,389
the entire state of New Jersey they are

131
00:04:32,709 --> 00:04:37,000
still moving towards a centralized

132
00:04:34,389 --> 00:04:39,189
production of medical marijuana what

133
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,870
will that mean well we as advocates have

134
00:04:39,189 --> 00:04:42,459
our foot in the door but we need a

135
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:43,899
little help pushing behind us or the

136
00:04:42,459 --> 00:04:46,180
door is going to close right on our foot

137
00:04:43,899 --> 00:04:48,759
because other than us lobbying the state

138
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:50,199
government we have the heavies the

139
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:52,149
medical and the pharmaceutical industry

140
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:55,089
in New Jersey are about to sink a test

141
00:04:52,149 --> 00:04:56,529
well into medical marijuana and it could

142
00:04:55,089 --> 00:04:58,509
be approved right through the state law

143
00:04:56,529 --> 00:05:00,399
you know if it weren't for the tenacity

144
00:04:58,509 --> 00:05:02,139
of this Democratic senator from New

145
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:04,000
Jersey they would have written Rutgers

146
00:05:02,139 --> 00:05:05,879
University into the law and we'd all be

147
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,110
turning around going what happened and

148
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:10,779
that is the truth of what's happening in

149
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:12,370
New Jersey right now it doesn't receive

150
00:05:10,779 --> 00:05:14,259
the attention that it deserves and

151
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:16,180
because it's so quiet through this

152
00:05:14,259 --> 00:05:18,730
implementation phase it's just what

153
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:20,350
these corporate interests want I want to

154
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:21,610
go back to the slide here that's us in

155
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:23,530
front of the Statehouse you know with a

156
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:26,230
few press conferences ken will ski our

157
00:05:23,529 --> 00:05:27,879
patient population of New Jersey and Ms

158
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:30,490
patient who went on trial named John

159
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:32,589
Wilson we've garnered significant media

160
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:35,050
attention and we turned the corner on

161
00:05:32,589 --> 00:05:36,789
the Rutgers University idea but our

162
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:38,590
governor chris christie republican

163
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:40,840
governor of new jersey think of him if

164
00:05:38,589 --> 00:05:42,849
you've ever seen the Sopranos he's sort

165
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:45,310
of like Tony Soprano mixed with karl

166
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:47,710
rove you know that's that's what we have

167
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:50,410
is our governor in New Jersey this guy's

168
00:05:47,709 --> 00:05:53,168
a former US Attorney he says he believes

169
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:54,240
in medical marijuana but he wants to do

170
00:05:53,168 --> 00:05:56,949
it right

171
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,930
now the New Jersey State teaching

172
00:05:56,949 --> 00:06:00,969
hospitals association was going to get

173
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:03,430
the monopoly contract on distribution

174
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:05,620
their representative Rick Goldstein no

175
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:07,660
relation showed up at the high times

176
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:10,090
medical cannabis cup and he found every

177
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:11,290
grower he could and he asked them if you

178
00:06:10,089 --> 00:06:14,259
could only grow three strains of

179
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:15,780
marijuana what would they be and I think

180
00:06:14,259 --> 00:06:17,370
you all know what that means

181
00:06:15,779 --> 00:06:19,989
the

182
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:22,149
centralization the homogenous ation of

183
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:23,189
medical marijuana could start in new

184
00:06:22,149 --> 00:06:26,620
jersey and

185
00:06:23,189 --> 00:06:29,110
i think that the interest that we are

186
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:32,620
fighting against is that small business

187
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:35,229
and this movement and the ideal of

188
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:37,079
medical marijuana needs to be

189
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:40,120
reinstalled here

190
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:43,180
medical marijuana is a challenge to the

191
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:45,850
health care system of America overall it

192
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:48,579
requires doctors and patients to talk to

193
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:51,310
each other it requires doctors to go and

194
00:06:48,579 --> 00:06:53,919
look up specific information it requires

195
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:56,410
a real relationship this is not the

196
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:57,730
health care that we have today where you

197
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:59,439
go in and you speak to your physician

198
00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:00,509
for five minutes and get prescribed a

199
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:02,800
pill

200
00:07:00,509 --> 00:07:03,969
they want to do that with medical

201
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,069
marijuana they want some sort of

202
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:08,200
consistent homogenized brand for this

203
00:07:06,069 --> 00:07:10,569
that doctors are comfortable with this

204
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:12,759
comfort zone of the medical industry is

205
00:07:10,569 --> 00:07:15,370
what we're fighting against but I think

206
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:18,519
that in New Jersey we are working hard

207
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:20,470
to meld these ideals it is inevitable

208
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:22,689
that corporate interests are going to

209
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:23,890
get involved with medical marijuana I'm

210
00:07:22,689 --> 00:07:25,600
not going to be able to fight them in

211
00:07:23,889 --> 00:07:27,430
New Jersey are nonprofits there as hard

212
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,480
as we work and as hard as our volunteers

213
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:30,370
work we're not gonna be able to fight

214
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:31,509
that interest in New Jersey and it's

215
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:33,850
inevitable that they're going to get

216
00:07:31,509 --> 00:07:35,469
involved nationally the question is do

217
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:37,060
we have a place at the table or do they

218
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:39,610
try and take it over one hundred percent

219
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:41,019
and the models in New Jersey have

220
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:44,080
already been taken on in Washington DC

221
00:07:41,019 --> 00:07:45,789
two ounces no home cultivation believe

222
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:48,209
me we're not happy about this law and

223
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:52,210
we're fighting to change it every day

224
00:07:48,209 --> 00:07:54,639
but again the inevitability of corporate

225
00:07:52,209 --> 00:07:57,729
interest seeing and counting their coin

226
00:07:54,639 --> 00:08:00,099
on medical marijuana right now in New

227
00:07:57,730 --> 00:08:01,509
Jersey is the reality how this is going

228
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,890
to play out i wish i could tell you here

229
00:08:01,509 --> 00:08:04,629
at the conference today but we will see

230
00:08:02,889 --> 00:08:06,990
it happen over the next six months now

231
00:08:04,629 --> 00:08:10,050
let's talk about happy stuff

232
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:12,160
that is the District Attorney of

233
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:14,170
Philadelphia standing with myself and

234
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,270
the radio producer Marty Moscow lean of

235
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:17,860
radio times in Philadelphia he is the

236
00:08:16,269 --> 00:08:19,419
first african-american district attorney

237
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:23,470
in Philadelphia's history Seth Williams

238
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:25,600
he's elected this year and we eased the

239
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:28,330
possession penalty for all Philadelphia

240
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:30,310
residents this year it was through one

241
00:08:28,329 --> 00:08:33,069
set of data three meetings with city

242
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:35,139
officials and police and this gentleman

243
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:36,330
right here seeking the support of the

244
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:39,330
state Supreme Court

245
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:42,430
Philadelphia was the last County in

246
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:45,190
Pennsylvania that required every single

247
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:48,250
person who was caught with any amount of

248
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:50,890
marijuana from a joint to 30 grams to be

249
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:54,049
prosecuted through the court to make a

250
00:08:50,889 --> 00:08:55,850
$300 bail hearing and to show up for

251
00:08:54,049 --> 00:08:58,659
criminal prosecution even if they were

252
00:08:55,850 --> 00:09:01,960
going to take a disorderly conduct plea

253
00:08:58,659 --> 00:09:04,669
4,700 cases a year

254
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:08,300
seventy-five percent black men between

255
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:10,879
the age of 19 and 35 only ten white

256
00:09:08,299 --> 00:09:12,679
women a month are cited for marijuana

257
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:15,350
possession in Philadelphia now I'm

258
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:17,419
Philly normal I can find more than ten

259
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:19,420
white women smoking pot we're walking in

260
00:09:17,419 --> 00:09:22,129
the city for like ten minutes you know

261
00:09:19,419 --> 00:09:24,049
but the truth is is that Philadelphia

262
00:09:22,129 --> 00:09:26,750
Police only find ten white women a month

263
00:09:24,049 --> 00:09:28,309
but they find 362 black men a month to

264
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:30,679
cite for marijuana possession less than

265
00:09:28,309 --> 00:09:32,269
30 grams the procedure before was go to

266
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:34,429
court make bail the procedure now

267
00:09:32,269 --> 00:09:36,919
starting in June is that you go into a

268
00:09:34,429 --> 00:09:38,479
diversion program at the point of arrest

269
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:40,339
you are offered the diversion program

270
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,870
you no longer have to make bail you show

271
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:43,940
up in court you pay a two-hundred-dollar

272
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:45,769
fine and it is automatically expunged

273
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:47,810
from your record this is a tangible

274
00:09:45,769 --> 00:09:49,519
change for the marijuana consumers of

275
00:09:47,809 --> 00:09:51,949
Philadelphia this year and this has been

276
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:53,870
of positive benefit I cannot even tell

277
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:56,540
you how many people hug me at concerts

278
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:58,129
and thank me because they were in there

279
00:09:56,539 --> 00:09:59,990
like I got busted last year but this

280
00:09:58,129 --> 00:10:02,480
year it was so different so but you know

281
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:03,889
it's Seth Williams and Harry Levine

282
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,629
who's sitting out here i have to tell

283
00:10:03,889 --> 00:10:07,129
you weren't harry's data and his work in

284
00:10:05,629 --> 00:10:08,840
New York you know and knowing how to

285
00:10:07,129 --> 00:10:10,460
pursue that and getting the data and

286
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:12,379
really highlighting the racial disparity

287
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:14,269
you know this is the key for us on the

288
00:10:12,379 --> 00:10:17,629
East Coast this is where we found police

289
00:10:14,269 --> 00:10:19,699
and prosecutors and city officials there

290
00:10:17,629 --> 00:10:21,649
was no argument back from them there is

291
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:23,570
no opposition to the racial disparity

292
00:10:21,649 --> 00:10:25,340
argument it's bad any way you look at it

293
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:27,260
it's a problem that people want to solve

294
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:28,600
and it's our job to give them the tools

295
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:31,309
to do that oh

296
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:33,290
yeah okay so New York this year just so

297
00:10:31,309 --> 00:10:35,419
everybody didn't miss there was the

298
00:10:33,289 --> 00:10:37,730
national normal ad ran in Times Square

299
00:10:35,419 --> 00:10:40,069
that's me and Rick music and steve blum

300
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:42,080
from celeb stoner and Danny Danko from

301
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:44,510
High Times Magazine we went up there it

302
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:46,490
was running we waited the afternoon it

303
00:10:44,509 --> 00:10:48,379
ran on this big screen so we had to wait

304
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:50,690
for the 15 seconds to take the picture

305
00:10:48,379 --> 00:10:53,120
but national normal times square this

306
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:54,650
year had an ad millions of people saw it

307
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,029
this year and you know what it's not

308
00:10:54,649 --> 00:10:57,799
like people are going oh my god there's

309
00:10:56,029 --> 00:10:59,990
a marijuana leaf on Times Square people

310
00:10:57,799 --> 00:11:01,549
see that come up and they cheer and that

311
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:04,090
is what is happening on the east coast

312
00:11:01,549 --> 00:11:04,089
folks

313
00:11:08,169 --> 00:11:12,679
we had a 1200 people march up south

314
00:11:11,059 --> 00:11:15,439
street this year for the global cannabis

315
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:16,789
March it was an excellent parade I think

316
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,810
that was a video it didn't quite start

317
00:11:16,789 --> 00:11:20,629
yet though let me see if I'm going to

318
00:11:17,809 --> 00:11:22,609
destroy starting yeah it's okay if it

319
00:11:20,629 --> 00:11:24,320
doesn't start it was our biggest March

320
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:26,600
ever there were no arrests at the at the

321
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,760
annual cannabis March this year I want

322
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:31,009
to let people know that while the focus

323
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:33,200
of reform activity is rightfully so on

324
00:11:31,009 --> 00:11:34,569
California this year that New Jersey and

325
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,310
Philadelphia have seen tremendous

326
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:38,960
strides forward there is a medical

327
00:11:37,309 --> 00:11:41,239
marijuana bill in Pennsylvania right now

328
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:43,100
HB 1393 we got it introduced in the

329
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:44,870
house in the Senate just three weeks ago

330
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:46,370
in Pittsburgh we had special hearings

331
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:48,980
where we skyped in Lester Grinspoon

332
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:51,200
which was awesome we had dr. Cyril Wecht

333
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:54,110
a forensic pathologist testified that in

334
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:56,060
over 38,000 autopsies cannabis was never

335
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:57,889
cause of death of course we know that

336
00:11:56,059 --> 00:11:59,869
but it's important to hear that I you

337
00:11:57,889 --> 00:12:01,250
know and I know it may seem passe to a

338
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:03,139
lot of folks who have already won these

339
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:04,549
battles in other states but this is a

340
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:06,949
discussion that never happened in the

341
00:12:04,549 --> 00:12:08,990
Keystone State they never had a bill in

342
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:10,400
Pennsylvania ever before this year and

343
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:13,549
it's a discussion people want to have

344
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:15,860
eighty percent of Pennsylvanians support

345
00:12:13,549 --> 00:12:17,629
medical marijuana from both parties it

346
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:19,820
is the most strongly supported

347
00:12:17,629 --> 00:12:21,740
Republican public policy issue in the

348
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:23,570
state of Pennsylvania people think

349
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:25,399
amongst the Republicans and Democrats

350
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:28,850
that medical the medical marijuana bill

351
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:31,370
is more positive than any candidate for

352
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:34,129
governor any candidate for Congress then

353
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:35,720
the job of the legislature what we need

354
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:38,088
to do is run medical marijuana for

355
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:40,519
office and we're in every single seed

356
00:12:38,089 --> 00:12:41,779
you know but that is that is really

357
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:43,579
what's happening you know in

358
00:12:41,778 --> 00:12:45,019
Pennsylvania people need to wait you

359
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:46,940
know it's hard for people to handle this

360
00:12:45,019 --> 00:12:48,620
look politicians get a thirty seven

361
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:50,450
forty percent approval rating on a pole

362
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:52,220
and they're popping champagne bottles

363
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:54,410
and trying to have sex with the interns

364
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:55,730
in the office eighty percent is

365
00:12:54,409 --> 00:12:58,549
something that they don't know how to

366
00:12:55,730 --> 00:13:00,379
handle it is the most popular public

367
00:12:58,549 --> 00:13:03,109
policy issue the state of Pennsylvania

368
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:05,539
has ever pulled is this medical

369
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:07,399
marijuana bill politicians politico's

370
00:13:05,539 --> 00:13:09,799
people in the Statehouse and the media

371
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:11,838
struggle with the popularity of medical

372
00:13:09,799 --> 00:13:14,599
marijuana on this basis now it's our job

373
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:16,529
to make sure that marijuana law reform

374
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:18,209
whether that be decriminalization

375
00:13:16,528 --> 00:13:20,039
realization or medical marijuana bills

376
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:21,809
we need to turn this corner with the

377
00:13:20,039 --> 00:13:24,629
politicos in America especially the

378
00:13:21,809 --> 00:13:27,239
state legislators this medical marijuana

379
00:13:24,629 --> 00:13:30,060
is not controversial eighty percent

380
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:32,519
approval rating give me a break this is

381
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:34,979
the most positive political capital you

382
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:37,049
can have in America today if you want to

383
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:38,699
win elections you need to support

384
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:40,049
marijuana reform and that's the message

385
00:13:38,698 --> 00:13:41,769
we're going to take out there the East

386
00:13:40,049 --> 00:13:45,168
Coast thank you everybody

387
00:13:41,769 --> 00:13:45,168
[Applause]
