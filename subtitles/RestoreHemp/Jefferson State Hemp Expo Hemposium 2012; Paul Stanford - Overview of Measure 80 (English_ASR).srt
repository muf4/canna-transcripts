1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:04,719
you I am a true believer that the reason

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:07,519
that marijuana is illegal isn't about

3
00:00:04,719 --> 00:00:09,359
drugs it isn't about marijuana it's

4
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:13,119
those are a smok screen you know it's a

5
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:17,439
myth that they made up it's really about

6
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:19,559
money power and H Fuel and hip fiber

7
00:00:17,439 --> 00:00:24,000
primarily and they made up the whole

8
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:27,399
marijuana myth back in uh 1911 pontio

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,759
vaa had a Mexican Revolution they had a

10
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:32,479
a song they had called lukara

11
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:34,200
and in that song they talk about the

12
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:36,398
Cockroach smokes

13
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,160
marijuana well shortly after that

14
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,558
happened you know they nationalized the

15
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:43,919
petrochemical industry in

16
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:46,799
Mexico the Rober Barons in Texas in

17
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:49,239
Pennsylvania who ran those industries

18
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:52,119
were not happy and they created this

19
00:00:49,238 --> 00:00:55,640
whole marijuana myth based on that word

20
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:58,959
to play on the racist fears of that were

21
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:01,759
popular you know until recently and so

22
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:06,478
uh we designed this bill to completely

23
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:08,399
reverse that and we did it uh uh by

24
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:11,079
allowing individuals to cultivate their

25
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:14,478
own and for people who want to sell

26
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:17,560
herb they would be able to get a license

27
00:01:14,478 --> 00:01:21,519
to sell it get a license to process it

28
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:23,400
and get a license to grow it says in our

29
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:25,519
initiative that the licenses will be

30
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,280
equitably distributed among all

31
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:30,599
applicants so no one big grower will

32
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:33,840
take advantage of the whole Market

33
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:35,879
you know uh in the Southeast they have

34
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,280
tobacco allotments where the tobacco

35
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:40,399
companies buy tobacco from

36
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,079
Farmers uh and they're Limited in the

37
00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:43,759
amount that they can grow they have a

38
00:01:42,078 --> 00:01:46,319
certain number of Acres a farmer might

39
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:50,680
have 500 Acres he'll have one acre of

40
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:53,319
tobacco 499 acres of corn or sorgum and

41
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:56,280
it's the tobac the acre of tobacco that

42
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:57,798
makes as much or more money than all the

43
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:01,118
other put together I think that's going

44
00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:03,560
to be the case once we regulate the sale

45
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:07,078
of marijuana we say in our initiative

46
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:09,759
that hemp will not be regulated and that

47
00:02:07,078 --> 00:02:12,359
uh we no federal license is required to

48
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:15,238
grow him you know to grow hemp under the

49
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:18,800
bill that passed in 2009 and that's a

50
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:22,000
good bill and Floyd pansky assistant DA

51
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:24,439
and state legislator had worked on it

52
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,680
for more than a more than a dozen years

53
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:30,479
more than uh about five sessions as far

54
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,560
five or six sessions anyway that

55
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:35,000
requires that you grow this hip that's

56
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:40,280
less than 3/10 of 1%

57
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:42,598
THC well that hip is dwarf himp and by

58
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:44,840
limiting the THC they limit the output

59
00:02:42,598 --> 00:02:48,479
of all the products that come from it

60
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:51,239
only produces about half as much fiber

61
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:55,759
and a 15th or a 20th as much seed oil

62
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:58,039
and protein and so we mandate that the

63
00:02:55,759 --> 00:03:00,598
hemp that will be grown will be the hemp

64
00:02:58,039 --> 00:03:04,598
that produces the most

65
00:03:00,598 --> 00:03:08,000
fuel fiber and food I believe that the

66
00:03:04,598 --> 00:03:11,158
high THC him with big flowers and big

67
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,080
seeds is going to be the most productive

68
00:03:11,158 --> 00:03:17,439
and so the whole idea that the hemp crop

69
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,920
is going to ruin the marijuana crop is

70
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:23,239
not true because the marijuana crop and

71
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:27,039
the HP crop will both be high THC hemp

72
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:29,438
it won't be the low THC hemp that uh

73
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:33,039
they force them to grow in Canada and

74
00:03:29,438 --> 00:03:35,359
force to grow in Europe so uh you know

75
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:37,199
Paul I wanted to just mention um we're

76
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,360
going to be discussing this right after

77
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:41,679
this

78
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:44,680
specifically about hemp and M80 measure

79
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,080
80 um so I though I'm glad you hit on it

80
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:49,120
I don't want to I don't want to spend

81
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:52,519
too much time on it we're trying to

82
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,840
focus campaign on on HP as well I I

83
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:56,000
agree and that's that's why we but we

84
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:59,079
wanted to break it into I really believe

85
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,719
that the seed is what we need we need

86
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:03,599
the seed it's the seed that's going to

87
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:05,239
be the most valuable product once we

88
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:08,759
pass this another thing our initiative

89
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:11,200
does is it names the the all the seeds

90
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:13,120
and starts of all varieties of cannabis

91
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:15,560
won't be regulated and will be

92
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,959
considered HP that way Monsanto can't

93
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:19,959
come in here and tell us our hemp is

94
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:22,560
already free and it's been grown in this

95
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:24,240
state for decades so they can't come in

96
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,839
here and Pat the seed and sell it back

97
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,639
to us you know the French seed is the

98
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:31,638
only seed that they can grow in those

99
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:33,918
those low THC countries it's a special

100
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:35,319
patented strength and it's it's one of

101
00:04:33,918 --> 00:04:37,038
the few that's been developed down to

102
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:39,360
that low THC level am I right they've

103
00:04:37,038 --> 00:04:41,879
got a new one that's down to 2% they've

104
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,800
got us all on the law now to3 they've

105
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:46,600
developed a new one at 0.2 but it's

106
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:48,680
Offspring naturally have more THC than

107
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,479
that so you can't grow that sied you can

108
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:52,120
only cultivate it but up in Canada

109
00:04:50,478 --> 00:04:53,079
that's what they're growing for is that

110
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:56,399
low

111
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:58,758
THC uh seed that's the primary economic

112
00:04:56,399 --> 00:05:02,478
product they're producing for body

113
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:05,639
products and food food and that only

114
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:07,839
makes about 600 lb of seed an acre study

115
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:10,000
out of notra Dame on feral hemp in

116
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:13,719
Southern Illinois Central Illinois says

117
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,720
that you uh you'll get uh over 8,000 lbs

118
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:18,199
of seed per acre 15 times more but

119
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,600
anyway I think that's where the money is

120
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:22,400
going to be in the future it's really

121
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:25,319
going to be in seed oil and seed protein

122
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:28,198
and especially as a fuel and that that

123
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:31,199
fuel will be much cheaper than any other

124
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:33,280
seed oil that's out there today uh

125
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,879
because the other seed oils he competes

126
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:39,758
against in terms of price for biodiesel

127
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:42,560
today would be soybean oil canola or

128
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:44,879
rape seed oil and sunflower seed oil

129
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,519
each of those produces about 100 to 120

130
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:50,560
gallons per acre where if you're getting

131
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:54,359
8,000 lb of seed breaker you're going to

132
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:57,000
get about 300 gallons of oil and 600 lb

133
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:58,319
of high protein hip seed meal left over

134
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,120
and I think that's where the money is

135
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:02,120
going to be at in the future and the

136
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:05,478
fiber will just be a byproduct of that

137
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:08,160
you know when you make corn into ethanol

138
00:06:05,478 --> 00:06:11,318
to make fuel you're taking food out of

139
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:14,800
the the supply chain so less people have

140
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:18,639
food where you make fuel from hip you're

141
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:20,759
putting food into the supply chain so uh

142
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:23,240
you know Jim a minute ago was talking

143
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:26,000
about the clear cutting you know we can

144
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:28,639
obviously plant hemp instead and we all

145
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:34,160
know I'm sure in this group that hemp

146
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:36,879
makes much more paper fabric canvas rope

147
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:40,599
lace linen from its stems than anything

148
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:44,800
else on this planning and so uh that'll

149
00:06:40,598 --> 00:06:46,759
free that up so we believe it'll raise

150
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,680
about 200 million dollars a year in

151
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:54,000
revenue for the state about 60 million

152
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:56,240
of that will be Savings in costs from uh

153
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,199
uh locking up marijuana growers and

154
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,160
dealers and processing possession

155
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:02,680
tickets and all of that

156
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:05,720
these numbers come from uh Harvard

157
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:09,478
Economist Jeffrey myON who did a study

158
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:11,759
nationally on this and is concentrated

159
00:07:09,478 --> 00:07:14,079
on Oregon as

160
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:18,280
well

161
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:20,519
so um you know we we designed it

162
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:22,359
specifically to be upheld in the

163
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:25,560
inevitable federal court challenge it'll

164
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:28,479
face after passage you know this uh

165
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:31,120
violates federal law obviously uh the

166
00:07:28,478 --> 00:07:32,680
Controlled Substances Act and the uh the

167
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,079
treaties that the United States

168
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:36,840
spearheaded the single convention treaty

169
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:39,038
the treaty actually mandates that it be

170
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:41,000
a schedule one drug but the state of

171
00:07:39,038 --> 00:07:43,598
Oregon's Board of Pharmacy led the way

172
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,240
in making a schedule two drug Iowa is

173
00:07:43,598 --> 00:07:49,878
now followed suit so a couple States

174
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:53,360
it's scheduled to already but uh as long

175
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:57,039
as we can't legally grow it

176
00:07:53,360 --> 00:08:00,038
then we there's no legal supply of it so

177
00:07:57,038 --> 00:08:03,878
this will provide a legal Supply to sale

178
00:08:00,038 --> 00:08:06,918
to pharmacies that will allow it and uh

179
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:10,319
sell to patients patients marijuana will

180
00:08:06,918 --> 00:08:14,240
not be taxed under our initiative it

181
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:20,360
says explicitly that marijuana for

182
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:22,639
patients will be sold at Farmers cost so

183
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:25,360
adult marijuana smokers will subsidize

184
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:27,038
the medical patients who need it it will

185
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:30,439
also allow doctors to prescribe

186
00:08:27,038 --> 00:08:32,000
marijuana for anything they think it

187
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:35,158
qualifies for it we won't have to go

188
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,200
through this ridiculous process with the

189
00:08:35,158 --> 00:08:39,080
health authority it's weird how they

190
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,200
changed their name from the health

191
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:44,759
department to the health

192
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:47,080
authority but uh it would allow doctors

193
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:48,919
to recommend it for anything so I think

194
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:52,000
the price would come way down

195
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:54,958
availability will be up uh and we'll

196
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,879
create tens of thousands of jobs and

197
00:08:54,958 --> 00:09:00,439
thousands of new companies and several

198
00:08:57,879 --> 00:09:02,919
new Industries and put Oregon on The

199
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,720
Cutting Edge of exciting New Economic

200
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:08,278
and

201
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:09,200
ecological development and uh we'll see

202
00:09:08,278 --> 00:09:13,320
hemp

203
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:20,079
biofuel become our primary energy source

204
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:22,079
for cars and ethanol from him and uh

205
00:09:20,078 --> 00:09:25,159
that's the world's largest

206
00:09:22,078 --> 00:09:29,399
industry and instead of the Saudi

207
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:31,278
princes and the uh corporate stock

208
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:33,480
holders putting it all the way in their

209
00:09:31,278 --> 00:09:35,720
Swiss bank accounts it'll go into our

210
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:38,320
Farmers Pockets where they'll spend it

211
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:40,200
in our communities and just change the

212
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:44,120
whole economic

213
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:46,320
Paradigm and that's the goal here so

214
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:49,799
it's a transformative

215
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:51,480
initiative and uh I'll just take

216
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:54,039
questions and

217
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:56,159
answer any other questions you might

218
00:09:54,039 --> 00:09:58,399
have about the initiative I love it

219
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:59,759
thank you very much Paul um I have a

220
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:02,000
couple quick questions for go the

221
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:05,679
audience that um one of the things you

222
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,480
just mentioned was the um the any

223
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:10,399
condition clause which I applaud you

224
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:12,240
from putting in but uh some people have

225
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:15,720
pointed out that there may be a conflict

226
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:19,079
with that the omma is also stated in

227
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:21,560
there that it's left intact yeah yeah

228
00:10:19,078 --> 00:10:25,199
and the omma of course currently has

229
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:26,958
limitations on conditions um so how does

230
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,000
that how does that work itself out is do

231
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:31,199
they just have to switch the OM any

232
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,958
condition the and you won't need a

233
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,959
license to grow it anymore or to possess

234
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:38,359
it so right now you know I didn't want

235
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:40,039
we wanted to keep it intact in case we

236
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:41,240
we envision that the the federal

237
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:43,480
government is going to come in here and

238
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:45,959
enjoin this law before it goes into

239
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:48,278
effect and this was designed especially

240
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:50,838
for that eventuality so we wanted to

241
00:10:48,278 --> 00:10:52,919
keep the omma intact and separate and

242
00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:54,560
there are actually two separability

243
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:56,319
Clauses at the very end of our

244
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:57,919
initiative we I couldn't decide on which

245
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:02,519
one to use so I put both of them in

246
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:05,159
there and so uh uh they they the pieces

247
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:07,278
of omma will still be there while this

248
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:09,240
is in joint you know the death of

249
00:11:07,278 --> 00:11:10,639
dignity law was passed here in Oregon

250
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:13,360
back in

251
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:15,480
1994 and it allowed doctors to prescribe

252
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:18,759
phenobarbitol to help terminally ill

253
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:20,278
patients kill themselves so that

254
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:21,879
conflicted with federal law too the

255
00:11:20,278 --> 00:11:24,039
federal government came in and enjoying

256
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:28,759
that law it was fast track through the

257
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:31,319
federal court system and uh in 1996 in

258
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:33,838
less than 2 years the Supreme Court came

259
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:36,120
back and upheld the death With Dignity

260
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:39,200
law and it's been in effect ever since

261
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:41,879
so that was similarly about doctors

262
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,278
prescribing PHA barbat you know so I

263
00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:46,919
that actually kind of leads to the other

264
00:11:43,278 --> 00:11:51,078
question I had about um conflict with

265
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:54,958
the feds over having state employees who

266
00:11:51,078 --> 00:11:57,239
will be working for the the OC Oregon

267
00:11:54,958 --> 00:12:00,719
cannabis commission not the Oregon

268
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:02,120
cannabis connection um cool name yeah

269
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,360
it's going to yeah that that that

270
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:06,519
moniker will work okay for me probably

271
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:08,320
uh is there a problem there because I

272
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:10,278
know that the the feds have made threats

273
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,519
to other states about prescribing or

274
00:12:10,278 --> 00:12:15,320
letting them you it'll be enjoined in

275
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:19,440
court so while it's enjoyed we won't be

276
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:22,160
able to start growing big fields for

277
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,959
adult use but HP is definitely allowed

278
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:26,799
under federal law technically it doesn't

279
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:30,759
say anything in federal law about THC

280
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:34,278
level for him and uh Med medical is also

281
00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:37,838
allowed under federal law so the

282
00:12:34,278 --> 00:12:39,600
scheduling will be the issue and there

283
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:42,040
it it comes down to the international

284
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,120
treaty the international treaties say

285
00:12:42,039 --> 00:12:47,120
that uh

286
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:49,399
if implementing this scheduling system

287
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:53,480
violates the human rights or the civil

288
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:55,480
rights of the parties uh signing it uh

289
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:57,680
population then those parties can

290
00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:00,759
withdraw from Those portions so we're

291
00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:04,239
saying that allow you know not allowing

292
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:06,360
us to grow the oldest crop crop that was

293
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:09,480
first sewn you know at least 12,000

294
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:11,519
years ago and the crop that produces

295
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:14,159
more fuel fiber food and Medicine than

296
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:17,600
any other violates our human rights in a

297
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:20,078
number of ways we set out seven points

298
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,759
in a preamble that are findings by the

299
00:13:20,078 --> 00:13:24,159
people and under our system of

300
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:27,799
government the theory is that the people

301
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:30,519
are sovereign the people are the rulers

302
00:13:27,799 --> 00:13:33,719
and below the rulers is a Constitution

303
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:35,720
and uh according to judicial precedent

304
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:39,959
the Constitution and international

305
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:41,800
treaties have equal weight in uh Court

306
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:45,399
proceedings below that is federal

307
00:13:41,799 --> 00:13:49,240
statutes in state Municipal statutes are

308
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:52,799
uh below that so we have the Sovereign

309
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:56,440
make these seven findings based on

310
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:59,958
historical legal scientific and

311
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:03,959
constitutional issues and so those

312
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:06,719
findings are going to be you know

313
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:09,679
reviewed by the Supreme Court and if

314
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,440
they agree as most of us do that the

315
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:14,278
people are sovereign they're not going

316
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:17,480
to be able to overturn that right all

317
00:14:14,278 --> 00:14:19,559
right and we also just for good measure

318
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:22,480
implemented the system of controls for

319
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:25,119
production that's mandated in the single

320
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:28,000
convention treaty that's why we have one

321
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:30,320
Central commission saying that it will

322
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,720
take control of the entire crop within 4

323
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:37,639
months of harvest and say the areas in

324
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:39,639
plots of land that uh are are to be

325
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:43,919
cultivated that's language that's lifted

326
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:47,399
from the single convention treaty and so

327
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:50,078
uh the commission will hold you know

328
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:53,919
electronic possession will be just as

329
00:14:50,078 --> 00:14:57,519
good as physical possession and so if

330
00:14:53,919 --> 00:15:00,360
you want to have like a like a winery or

331
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:03,320
a brew pub work to today where you grow

332
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:05,720
your own you process it and you sell

333
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:09,959
your product on your own land that will

334
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:14,240
be allowed and so that was the plan in

335
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:16,919
this is to make cannabis inexpensive for

336
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:19,399
everyone and to free it for fuel fiber

337
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:23,278
and food like I said I really believe

338
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:25,278
the seed Fuel and food are going to be

339
00:15:23,278 --> 00:15:28,360
the primary economic product that we'll

340
00:15:25,278 --> 00:15:30,278
be producing once we legalize marijuana

341
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,720
it's a d very tight piece of legislation

342
00:15:30,278 --> 00:15:35,639
it's obviously worked on it for years

343
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:38,600
and it's it's I apprciate all your in

344
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:40,560
1988 HED a good friend of mine has

345
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:43,839
passed away now and we worked on it it's

346
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:46,239
been through 200 drafts we've had input

347
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:49,880
from over 200 experts all around the

348
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:52,720
country and we did two polls to uh

349
00:15:49,879 --> 00:15:54,360
figure out what' be more likely to pass

350
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,959
the poll said hey don't put it in with

351
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:58,440
liquor because uh we'll lose a certain

352
00:15:56,958 --> 00:16:01,479
percentage of Voters and there's the

353
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:02,839
view that the OLCC is corrupt so we took

354
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:05,759
it re you know one of the things we

355
00:16:02,839 --> 00:16:08,079
changed between 2008 and 2010 was

356
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:10,199
setting up uh a cannabis commission

357
00:16:08,078 --> 00:16:11,638
that's exclusively cannabis and saying

358
00:16:10,198 --> 00:16:13,758
that you know the markets won't be

359
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:16,318
merged kind of like what happens unless

360
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:18,278
they outlaw it in the Netherlands uh

361
00:16:16,318 --> 00:16:20,519
where the markets for hard drugs and

362
00:16:18,278 --> 00:16:24,198
marijuana are kept separate because they

363
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:26,159
allow sales to adults so let's open it

364
00:16:24,198 --> 00:16:28,278
up to anybody who's got

365
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:30,600
questions yeah right there hey Paul can

366
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:32,720
you talk about exportation of marijuana

367
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:34,720
and the byproducts to other states or

368
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,920
other countries in this measure so the

369
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,399
exportation of of marijuana and by

370
00:16:36,919 --> 00:16:40,719
products to other states or countries

371
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:44,440
under how it's covered under OCTA yeah

372
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:46,959
we say that uh the price will be set to

373
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:49,319
discourage illegal Import and Export so

374
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:52,159
at first the price will be higher

375
00:16:49,318 --> 00:16:56,559
because we don't want it to be illegally

376
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:58,639
shipped to Idaho or Nevada or any place

377
00:16:56,559 --> 00:17:00,879
else where it can't be legally shipped

378
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:03,839
but it says that the OCC the Oregon

379
00:17:00,879 --> 00:17:05,880
cannabis commission will promote its

380
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:09,038
sale in all legal National and

381
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:12,439
international markets so as the other

382
00:17:09,038 --> 00:17:13,720
states start to regulate it say i502

383
00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:16,558
passes up in

384
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:18,318
Washington when we produce it we'll be

385
00:17:16,558 --> 00:17:20,318
able to ship it to them because they

386
00:17:18,318 --> 00:17:23,599
would be a legal market and they'd be

387
00:17:20,318 --> 00:17:25,959
selling it so uh the same would be true

388
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:29,558
for any other legitimate Market as

389
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:32,200
Freedom spreads and people are able to

390
00:17:29,558 --> 00:17:34,519
buy it legally in all the states because

391
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:37,279
I really believe if if we pass this here

392
00:17:34,519 --> 00:17:40,720
in Oregon it will change the law but if

393
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:43,038
it passes in Colorado and Washington too

394
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:45,000
it's going to be a major transformation

395
00:17:43,038 --> 00:17:47,839
we're going to see It'll be akin to the

396
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,679
top Ling of the Berlin wall or the

397
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:53,399
toping of linen statue in Red Square you

398
00:17:50,679 --> 00:17:54,960
know Freedom will ring around the world

399
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,960
there'll be those people you know there

400
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:59,919
are over a thousand people in the

401
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,720
American jails for 20 years or more a

402
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:03,759
100 or so for life without the

403
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:06,360
possibility of parole right here in the

404
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:08,440
United States they never owned a gun

405
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:11,240
they never threaten another person they

406
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:13,640
didn't steal anything they just grew a

407
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:15,640
plant and they are in prison for life

408
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:17,960
without the possibility of parole if I

409
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:19,480
was charged for growing marijuana which

410
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:21,480
I do with a license if I had to go

411
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:23,480
through the federal courts technically I

412
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:25,599
could face life without the possibility

413
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:29,720
of parole because I have priors for

414
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:31,319
growing marijuana so uh this will change

415
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:33,319
that just think of those poor people in

416
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:36,038
Malaysia where they're hung for 200

417
00:18:33,319 --> 00:18:37,158
grams or more man if these things pass

418
00:18:36,038 --> 00:18:40,079
this is just going to be a ray of

419
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:42,440
sunshine into our culture's life all

420
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:44,038
over this world and so that's what we're

421
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:46,720
we're trying to do right now we have a

422
00:18:44,038 --> 00:18:48,400
poll out in the field it's a small poll

423
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,880
we tried to fund a big poll we weren't

424
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:55,080
able to do it so we've gone ahead with a

425
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:57,679
small poll and uh we have a a really

426
00:18:55,079 --> 00:18:59,319
catchy visual ad campaign that should

427
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:01,240
come out sometime in the next week or

428
00:18:59,319 --> 00:19:03,359
two we're going to be cutting more ads

429
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:05,839
with Willie Nelson you know Willie

430
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:07,719
Nelson did an ad for us in March that

431
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:09,439
was a big help he's going to cut another

432
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:11,720
ad for us here just before our hempstock

433
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:13,480
Festival that's huge that's great and he

434
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:16,880
uh

435
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:20,000
uh is going to be one of the faces he

436
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:22,360
has a 5 acres of land here in Oregon he

437
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,880
started his songwriting career as a DJ

438
00:19:22,359 --> 00:19:26,359
in Portland for those of you who don't

439
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:28,760
know that Willie Nelson in the early 60s

440
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:31,038
was a disc jockey on a country music

441
00:19:28,759 --> 00:19:32,919
station in Portland and he started his

442
00:19:31,038 --> 00:19:35,359
songwriting career and first wrote his

443
00:19:32,919 --> 00:19:38,000
first hits for paty Klein that song

444
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:41,199
crazy while he was a DJ in Portland so

445
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,679
his and he owns a big chunk of p uh

446
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:46,840
sequential Pacific biodiesel which is

447
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:50,480
the largest biodiesel producer in the

448
00:19:46,839 --> 00:19:52,038
United States and uh he's one of the

449
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,798
main spokespeople for the national

450
00:19:52,038 --> 00:19:58,879
biodiesel Alliance he's opened a number

451
00:19:54,798 --> 00:20:01,158
of hemp at biodiesel not hemp but bi

452
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:04,080
diesel stores they went they were Wily's

453
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:05,679
truck stop sequential work with them

454
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:08,798
they were in California Texas they've

455
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:10,559
gone out of business now but uh he's a

456
00:20:08,798 --> 00:20:12,798
big proponent of biodiesel in fact I

457
00:20:10,558 --> 00:20:15,678
first found out about biodiesel in

458
00:20:12,798 --> 00:20:18,679
October of 1990 when I went back to

459
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:21,840
Lexington Kentucky and Gatewood

460
00:20:18,679 --> 00:20:23,600
gbre took a few gallons of biodiesel and

461
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:25,678
poured it into his engine and drove from

462
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:28,038
Lexington through the state capital in

463
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:29,400
Frankfurt and on to Louisville where

464
00:20:28,038 --> 00:20:33,200
Willie did a

465
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:36,960
concert for Gatewood so uh there's a

466
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:39,880
little aside any other question

467
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:41,798
Justin I was curious uh there was a

468
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:44,400
interesting very flattering article a

469
00:20:41,798 --> 00:20:47,279
few weeks ago in a Portland paper on the

470
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:50,038
internet I saw it was uh brought up

471
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:52,639
issues with the education Provisions

472
00:20:50,038 --> 00:20:54,640
that are in your bill it Bill scare you

473
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:57,679
to put in did you no you know they they

474
00:20:54,640 --> 00:21:01,600
misrepresented it entirely they took uh

475
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:04,759
they took points from the Preamble we at

476
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:07,759
at one of the seven preambles listed

477
00:21:04,759 --> 00:21:10,440
some findings by three state Supreme

478
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:13,519
Courts and the schaer commission what

479
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:16,440
the [ __ ] you talking about man and so

480
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:20,278
three state Supreme Courts uh the state

481
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:23,120
of uh Alaska in Raven versus State the

482
00:21:20,278 --> 00:21:26,599
state of Michigan in the people of

483
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:30,000
Michigan uh versus uh Johns

484
00:21:26,599 --> 00:21:32,359
Sinclair and the state of haai in a case

485
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,919
with Paul caner the guitarist for the

486
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:37,639
Jefferson Airplane and Starship uh we

487
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:40,120
based the this these set of findings on

488
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:42,759
these common issues in these three state

489
00:21:40,119 --> 00:21:45,278
supreme court rulings and in the the

490
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:48,599
schaer commission that was commissioned

491
00:21:45,278 --> 00:21:50,558
by uh President Nixon back in the 70s

492
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:51,918
and so they took these things in the

493
00:21:50,558 --> 00:21:53,918
Preamble and said that we're going to

494
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:56,480
force the kids to learn this well if you

495
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:58,840
look at the actual language of the

496
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:02,278
educational portion

497
00:21:58,839 --> 00:22:04,798
uh it says that children will learn

498
00:22:02,278 --> 00:22:08,278
about the scientifically accurate

499
00:22:04,798 --> 00:22:10,158
information about drugs and psychoactive

500
00:22:08,278 --> 00:22:14,880
substances doesn't say anything about

501
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:17,960
marijuana and that uh uh they'll be

502
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:21,400
taught accurate information and how to

503
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:24,000
uh the use of substances can harm their

504
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:26,840
development and discourage the use of

505
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,079
those substances but if if as adults

506
00:22:26,839 --> 00:22:30,959
they decide to usey psychoactive

507
00:22:29,079 --> 00:22:34,278
substances but they still have to

508
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:36,519
responsibly fulfill all the duties that

509
00:22:34,278 --> 00:22:38,880
they owe to other citizens under our

510
00:22:36,519 --> 00:22:40,639
social compact such as you know not

511
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,440
hitting each other with a car not

512
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,600
beating each other up or stealing from

513
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:46,960
each other basically it just teaches

514
00:22:44,599 --> 00:22:48,519
Civics you know good oldfashioned Civics

515
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,360
it doesn't get taught Much Anymore yeah

516
00:22:48,519 --> 00:22:53,240
I I read that piece and I thought it was

517
00:22:50,359 --> 00:22:55,119
kind of ridiculously that editorial was

518
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:57,319
propaganda that that gave us an insight

519
00:22:55,119 --> 00:23:00,239
to how they're going to getting on you

520
00:22:57,319 --> 00:23:02,278
about Genesis and yeah they are rid they

521
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:04,640
are there was another editorial in the

522
00:23:02,278 --> 00:23:07,119
Portland Tribune a couple days ago where

523
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:10,200
the sheriffs and the prosecutors and the

524
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:11,678
police have uh basically said you know

525
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:13,720
we're all going to go to hell in a hand

526
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:16,720
basket the Mexican cartels are going to

527
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:18,960
move in here and take over the state and

528
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,480
uh we're all it's going to be Al Capone

529
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:24,200
again well it's just the opposite of

530
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:25,798
what the actual truth is but you know uh

531
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:27,640
if we have they want to fight the

532
00:23:25,798 --> 00:23:30,278
argument you know using those kind of

533
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:32,200
Lies it's just you know the question is

534
00:23:30,278 --> 00:23:34,798
how well can we get out our message

535
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:36,759
about him about George Washington and

536
00:23:34,798 --> 00:23:41,158
Thomas Jefferson and the founders

537
00:23:36,759 --> 00:23:43,720
depending on him and uh promoting him

538
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:45,919
George Washington wrote to Alexander

539
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:47,798
Hamilton and said how can we promote him

540
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:50,320
you know he's Secretary of the Treasury

541
00:23:47,798 --> 00:23:52,200
and would it be proper to to have a

542
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:55,079
policy encouraging the cultivation of

543
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:57,159
him well that's what our initiative will

544
00:23:55,079 --> 00:24:00,678
do is encourage the cultivation of him

545
00:23:57,159 --> 00:24:03,320
and financing and promote it and so it's

546
00:24:00,679 --> 00:24:08,840
really a transformative Bill any other

547
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:08,839
questions uh for Paul yeah go ahead

548
00:24:10,558 --> 00:24:13,558
iary

549
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:19,000
my yeah I'm a disabled vet

550
00:24:21,079 --> 00:24:29,199
myself watching State yeah I'm what of

551
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:32,080
access have that information

552
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:34,120
well the thing is this guy in Virginia

553
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:37,720
who's also a veteran Michael Kravitz

554
00:24:34,119 --> 00:24:41,158
worked to get a policy through the VA VA

555
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:42,159
and so now the VA allows you to use

556
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:44,919
medical

557
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:46,799
marijuana as a patient there and still

558
00:24:44,919 --> 00:24:48,759
be on their paying contracts and still

559
00:24:46,798 --> 00:24:49,798
get their other health care and not use

560
00:24:48,759 --> 00:24:52,640
that against you as long as you're

561
00:24:49,798 --> 00:24:56,158
following your state law right mine mine

562
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:59,399
basic Department ah is it Champs or

563
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:03,520
something like that well no it's

564
00:24:59,398 --> 00:25:03,519
Department right right

565
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:09,440
VA well you know we don't specifically

566
00:25:06,919 --> 00:25:12,038
mandate that the government change that

567
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:14,759
for uh at a federal level we're not in a

568
00:25:12,038 --> 00:25:17,319
position to to make federal law through

569
00:25:14,759 --> 00:25:20,558
the state initiative process but I think

570
00:25:17,319 --> 00:25:22,398
that the Supreme Court will enjoying it

571
00:25:20,558 --> 00:25:25,000
a lot of parts of this law parts of it

572
00:25:22,398 --> 00:25:29,239
will go into effect parts of it won't

573
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:30,960
and uh that uh we built a proposal that

574
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:32,798
can be upheld in the inevitable federal

575
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,399
court challenge it'll face after passing

576
00:25:32,798 --> 00:25:36,879
yeah it's funny we got to put our our

577
00:25:34,398 --> 00:25:39,239
faith in the uh Supreme Court to make

578
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:42,520
this decision and not our legislators or

579
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:45,480
ourselves again right but oh well that's

580
00:25:42,519 --> 00:25:48,558
the way that the legal no confidence in

581
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:50,798
the Supreme Court of John Roberts at all

582
00:25:48,558 --> 00:25:53,158
but we'll see what happens go ahead Tony

583
00:25:50,798 --> 00:25:56,480
hey Paul how do you how do you foresee

584
00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:59,200
the issues of rep rep you know what I'm

585
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:01,839
talk

586
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:04,000
reciprocity reciprocity so that I can

587
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:08,119
drive from Santa Fe to Phoenix to San

588
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:10,440
Diego back Las Vegas up Portland

589
00:26:08,119 --> 00:26:12,479
Washington you know initially of course

590
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:14,640
we can't address that there is

591
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:17,880
Reciprocity for medical marijuana card

592
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:20,480
holders in five states and the District

593
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:22,278
of Columbia quite ironically if you have

594
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,120
a medical marijuana permit you're

595
00:26:22,278 --> 00:26:27,240
covered in the three M States I like to

596
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:28,798
call them Michigan Maine Montana also

597
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,720
Arizona and Rhode Island

598
00:26:28,798 --> 00:26:32,240
and the District of columia so you just

599
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,558
carry your permit when you're in those

600
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:36,240
States and you're legal there the folks

601
00:26:34,558 --> 00:26:38,079
at the Portland airport let me fly out

602
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,120
with marijuana in my volcano all the

603
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:42,038
time you know they'll let you fly out

604
00:26:40,119 --> 00:26:44,639
with a pound and a half without any

605
00:26:42,038 --> 00:26:47,240
problem I even had one uh TSA guy tell

606
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:49,520
me his dad had a volcano and loved it

607
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:51,640
and that uh does that does that depend

608
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:53,720
on where you're flying to no because you

609
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:56,000
don't get checked when you fly too they

610
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:58,120
only check it when you fly where you fly

611
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,720
from so when you land there's nobody

612
00:26:58,119 --> 00:27:01,918
there there to search you and I said but

613
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,360
if you're leaving Portland and you're

614
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:06,000
flying to New York City you're not going

615
00:27:04,359 --> 00:27:07,479
to be legal in New York City and I've

616
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,839
done that I've flown from Portland New

617
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:14,200
York City I always carry pot wherever I

618
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:16,158
go you know and so I uh I'm just

619
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:18,159
discreet and I haven't had a problem

620
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:20,399
with uh carrying it I try not to bring

621
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:22,399
much back when I fly up I might just

622
00:27:20,398 --> 00:27:24,079
bring a little tiny bit and try to give

623
00:27:22,398 --> 00:27:25,158
most of it away where I go you know and

624
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:26,480
then it's smart enough to figure out in

625
00:27:25,159 --> 00:27:27,640
Portland that you're Landing in New York

626
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,159
and you shouldn't have that they just

627
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:30,759
see that you got card and say go ahead

628
00:27:29,159 --> 00:27:33,559
yeah they don't determine where you're

629
00:27:30,759 --> 00:27:36,440
going to right there I when before when

630
00:27:33,558 --> 00:27:38,359
the law first went into effect I had a

631
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:41,200
uh TSA guy tell me well where are you

632
00:27:38,359 --> 00:27:43,558
flying to said oh I'm flying to Hawaii I

633
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:46,120
have a Hawaii car too clinics in Hawaii

634
00:27:43,558 --> 00:27:47,278
too and so uh he said you're not going

635
00:27:46,119 --> 00:27:49,239
to be legal when you land there I said

636
00:27:47,278 --> 00:27:50,798
well here's my Hawaii car well you're

637
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,960
not going to be legal when you're flying

638
00:27:50,798 --> 00:27:53,480
between here and there it's over the

639
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:55,919
open ocean and you're not going to be

640
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:57,960
able to arrest any so he finally let me

641
00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:02,360
go but that was about you know 10 years

642
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:04,960
ago so but since then 10 years ago yeah

643
00:28:02,359 --> 00:28:07,319
that's pretty good Paving it I've been

644
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:10,480
carrying my volcano in every flight for

645
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:12,480
a long long time thank you any other

646
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:16,120
questions yeah

647
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,120
waves you walk us through

648
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:24,840
the sure um the initiative says that the

649
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:26,640
commission will be appointed by the

650
00:28:24,839 --> 00:28:29,879
governor the first seven people will be

651
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:33,320

license applications by February 28th so

656
00:28:42,839 --> 00:28:50,278
we can try to get a crop in the ground

657
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:53,319
this year next year and so uh uh you'll

658
00:28:50,278 --> 00:28:54,839
simply apply you know the the commission

659
00:28:53,319 --> 00:28:57,038
will create new rules through the

660
00:28:54,839 --> 00:28:59,278
administrative rule process it'll be

661
00:28:57,038 --> 00:29:01,720
fast-tracked you know if we pass it I

662
00:28:59,278 --> 00:29:04,599
expect I'll be one of the Commissioners

663
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:08,200
and so uh I'll be trying to maintain the

664
00:29:04,599 --> 00:29:10,079
Integrity of the the law and there'll be

665
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:12,159
six other people on the commission I'm

666
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:14,558
not sure who all they'll be the governor

667
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:16,559
will appoint them this first time around

668
00:29:14,558 --> 00:29:18,639
there's been some concern about the

669
00:29:16,558 --> 00:29:20,678
composition of the commission one of the

670
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:22,360
last things I changed in the the

671
00:29:20,679 --> 00:29:23,480
initiative was the composition the

672
00:29:22,359 --> 00:29:25,119
commission this that's just going to

673
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:27,679
have the governor appoint them

674
00:29:25,119 --> 00:29:30,639
all and now that's actually had some

675
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:32,320
blow back because uh that's been one of

676
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:35,440
the most contentious issues when you

677
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:38,558
look at it we we we I changed it at the

678
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:41,679
last minute before filing it to have

679
00:29:38,558 --> 00:29:45,158
five members that are selected in an

680
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:47,679
election by Growers and processors so

681
00:29:45,159 --> 00:29:49,559
Growers and processors will elect five

682
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:53,120
members of the commission and then two

683
00:29:49,558 --> 00:29:55,798
will be uh named by the governor that

684
00:29:53,119 --> 00:29:58,239
sounds nice it's very similar to all

685
00:29:55,798 --> 00:29:59,720
agricultural Commissions in the state

686
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:03,359
there there's an agricultural commission

687
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:06,200
law that says 70% of the Agricultural

688
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:08,079
commission uh has to be people in the

689
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:10,159
industry the affected industry but the

690
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:11,398
media has picked up on that and said

691
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:13,840
we're going to have the Growers and

692
00:30:11,398 --> 00:30:15,158
processors running it all and once again

693
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:16,439
we're all going to go to hell in a hand

694
00:30:15,159 --> 00:30:17,519
basket right I'm see are you getting

695
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:20,600
Kickback

696
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:22,759
from even people in the industry patient

697
00:30:20,599 --> 00:30:24,519
specifically patient centered

698
00:30:22,759 --> 00:30:27,319
organizations that are saying well why

699
00:30:24,519 --> 00:30:28,558
aren't patients on this panel is that

700
00:30:27,319 --> 00:30:30,558
part of it as well

701
00:30:28,558 --> 00:30:33,960
they want to be on first it be named by

702
00:30:30,558 --> 00:30:36,480
the government the medical thing you

703
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:38,558
know uh it's not a medical only

704
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:40,679
initiative it's for complete full

705
00:30:38,558 --> 00:30:42,798
transformation of this and it'll change

706
00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:44,640
the whole dynamic when when patients

707
00:30:42,798 --> 00:30:46,720
don't have to pay for a license and

708
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,360
don't have an artificial limit on the

709
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:51,558
amount they can grow and a doctor can

710
00:30:48,359 --> 00:30:53,038
recommend it for anything uh the only I

711
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:56,558
don't know many people after that

712
00:30:53,038 --> 00:30:58,960
that'll be you know getting an OM C you

713
00:30:56,558 --> 00:31:00,798
know uh why needed if you can grow your

714
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:04,639
own without a license why limit yourself

715
00:31:00,798 --> 00:31:06,960
to you know the the the 12 six standard

716
00:31:04,638 --> 00:31:08,240
the 18 plants and pound in half when

717
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,558
there's no limit on the amount you can

718
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:12,278
grow in fact our initiative says the

719
00:31:10,558 --> 00:31:14,240
seeds and starts of all strains of

720
00:31:12,278 --> 00:31:16,519
cannabis will be considered hemp so the

721
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:18,839
horiculture market for cannabis will be

722
00:31:16,519 --> 00:31:21,519
wide open you'll be able to go to any

723
00:31:18,839 --> 00:31:24,839
horiculture place any Garden Store Fred

724
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:26,319
Meyer even and buy your marijuana plants

725
00:31:24,839 --> 00:31:27,959
right there legally that would

726
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:31,079
technically be legal it' be up to those

727
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:35,519
businesses to decide what they want to

728
00:31:31,079 --> 00:31:38,079
they want to sell like it yeah yeah you

729
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:41,079
know but does it uh I was going to say

730
00:31:38,079 --> 00:31:42,398
is it um well go ahead go ahead W what's

731
00:31:41,079 --> 00:31:44,199
the

732
00:31:42,398 --> 00:31:47,719
anticip

733
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:49,639
app what's the question I'll I'll repeat

734
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:52,519
I think 30 days or less you asked what's

735
00:31:49,638 --> 00:31:54,918
the antipa turn around for we say that

736
00:31:52,519 --> 00:31:58,038
the commission will set the rules and

737
00:31:54,919 --> 00:31:59,880
regulations necessary to carry out it

738
00:31:58,038 --> 00:32:02,278
duties but if I'm there and have

739
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:04,200
anything to do with it it's going to be

740
00:32:02,278 --> 00:32:05,599
30 days or less you know there's no

741
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,639
reason it should take longer than 30

742
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:08,918
days you know it's kind of like a

743
00:32:06,638 --> 00:32:10,359
driver's license it doesn't take a month

744
00:32:08,919 --> 00:32:13,880
to get a driver's license I don't know

745
00:32:10,359 --> 00:32:16,000
why the OM takes six months or anything

746
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:18,639
as long as you have not violated this

747
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,759
new law the old laws won't have any

748
00:32:18,638 --> 00:32:23,398
impact if you're like me and you're a

749
00:32:20,759 --> 00:32:25,638
marijuana felon that won't stop you at

750
00:32:23,398 --> 00:32:28,798
all you'll be able to get a license it

751
00:32:25,638 --> 00:32:31,519
only will be if you violate this new law

752
00:32:28,798 --> 00:32:34,359
then your access to the licenses will be

753
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:37,399
restricted but I think we don't set up

754
00:32:34,359 --> 00:32:39,479
the actual way waves we we say that

755
00:32:37,398 --> 00:32:41,000
it'll be set up by the commission you

756
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:43,159
know it's already long enough really you

757
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,159
know

758
00:32:48,759 --> 00:32:53,119
it's over that's right I believe the

759
00:32:51,278 --> 00:32:54,839
patients if they they want to remain

760
00:32:53,119 --> 00:32:56,479
protected it might not not just be a

761
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:57,678
year it might be a little bit longer

762
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:01,319
than a year if you want to wait till you

763
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:03,798
have have a a legal uh store to go buy

764
00:33:01,319 --> 00:33:05,398
it from uh you know if it's enjoined in

765
00:33:03,798 --> 00:33:07,839
the courts I think the dispensaries that

766
00:33:05,398 --> 00:33:10,038
are just serving patients will be legal

767
00:33:07,839 --> 00:33:11,839
because that doesn't conflict with the

768
00:33:10,038 --> 00:33:14,359
international treaties at all also the

769
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:17,119
Horticultural use does not conflict the

770
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:19,319
the international treaties say that

771
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:22,638
cannabis can still be cultivated for

772
00:33:19,319 --> 00:33:25,678
horiculture and for a hemp fuel fiber

773
00:33:22,638 --> 00:33:27,319
and food and medicine and that the the

774
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:29,320
parties don't have to prohibit this so

775
00:33:27,319 --> 00:33:31,439
that'll immediately free it for all of

776
00:33:29,319 --> 00:33:32,879
those uses and that won't be regulated

777
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:36,558
it'll only be if you want to get a

778
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:40,639
license and sell it for nonmedical

779
00:33:36,558 --> 00:33:42,798
purposes then uh that would be the

780
00:33:40,638 --> 00:33:45,079
reason you'd have to to get one of these

781
00:33:42,798 --> 00:33:46,679
new OCC license Oregon cannabis

782
00:33:45,079 --> 00:33:49,638
commission licenses all right you want

783
00:33:46,679 --> 00:33:52,200
to take one more question sure more more

784
00:33:49,638 --> 00:33:53,599
okay good um any yeah I'm kind of

785
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:55,360
confused about the whole International

786
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:57,038
treaty and what they were telling us we

787
00:33:55,359 --> 00:33:57,759
have to do and what like we're trying to

788
00:33:57,038 --> 00:33:59,398
abide by

789
00:33:57,759 --> 00:34:02,359
[Music]

790
00:33:59,398 --> 00:34:04,038
well there's this guy who really came up

791
00:34:02,359 --> 00:34:07,759
and and spearheaded marijuana

792
00:34:04,038 --> 00:34:11,599
prohibition he's a Harry anslinger his

793
00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:16,280
wife was the niece of uh Andrew melon

794
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:21,919
who uh was a big wig and uh in steel and

795
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:24,159
in oil and uh all of those all of those

796
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:27,279
and so uh the

797
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:29,200
petrochemical industry and so uh he

798
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:32,079
spear headed it and he came up after

799
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:36,039
getting marijuana illegal in the 30s he

800
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:38,039
came up with uh this treaty idea that he

801
00:34:36,039 --> 00:34:40,039
spearheaded and it's a single convention

802
00:34:38,039 --> 00:34:43,719
treaty that mandates that marijuana via

803
00:34:40,039 --> 00:34:45,480
schedule one drug so uh that treaty is

804
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:47,559
in place and we tried to write our

805
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:49,480
initiative to be in as close compliance

806
00:34:47,559 --> 00:34:50,799
with it as possible in section one of

807
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:52,760
our initiative it says this is a

808
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,519
scientific act by the people of the

809
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:57,079
state of Oregon to lower the misuse and

810
00:34:54,519 --> 00:35:00,519
abuse of cannabis and stop the diversion

811
00:34:57,079 --> 00:35:03,839
to mind you know and so that sentence is

812
00:35:00,519 --> 00:35:05,358
in there specifically to add more

813
00:35:03,838 --> 00:35:07,559
compliance to the single convention

814
00:35:05,358 --> 00:35:09,239
treaty but I it's something that I I

815
00:35:07,559 --> 00:35:11,599
look forward to the day it's removed

816
00:35:09,239 --> 00:35:14,399
it's crazy they'll take the oldest

817
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:16,559
agricultural crop first crop purposely

818
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:20,240
grown by humans the plant that makes

819
00:35:16,559 --> 00:35:22,320
more fuel more fiber more food more

820
00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:25,159
medicine and any other plant and they're

821
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:27,240
going to make that one illegal it's all

822
00:35:25,159 --> 00:35:29,319
about the petrochemical pharmaceutical

823
00:35:27,239 --> 00:35:31,919
military industrial transnational

824
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:33,880
corporate Elite fascist sons of a

825
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:36,159
[ __ ] careful you're sounding like

826
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:37,320
Michael Moore actually that's a quote

827
00:35:36,159 --> 00:35:40,199
from a good old friend of mine who

828
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:42,280
passed away uh in January Gatewood gbre

829
00:35:40,199 --> 00:35:43,879
he introduced me to Willie Nelson he's

830
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:45,720
the guy who drove around Kentucky I was

831
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:49,200
talking about in the H powered car back

832
00:35:45,719 --> 00:35:49,959
in October of 1990 he had another really

833
00:35:49,199 --> 00:35:54,679
good

834
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:57,679
line and uh you know my father was a on

835
00:35:54,679 --> 00:36:00,519
a PT Boat World War II and he fought the

836
00:35:57,679 --> 00:36:02,719
the fascists and to stop the Japanese

837
00:36:00,519 --> 00:36:06,719
and other friends of ours like Dr Philip

838
00:36:02,719 --> 00:36:09,279
LEC he crossed the Ry Under Fire uh from

839
00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:11,239
the Nazis and 2third of his platoon were

840
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:14,319
killed as they were crossing the Rind

841
00:36:11,239 --> 00:36:17,039
and he arrested 26 soldiers officers

842
00:36:14,318 --> 00:36:19,159
Nazi officers at once and so they didn't

843
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:22,838
fight the fascist so we would be have to

844
00:36:19,159 --> 00:36:25,118
pee in a jar for a

845
00:36:22,838 --> 00:36:28,599
job and that's another one of those gate

846
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:29,760
with gbre lines I'm pleased to carry on

847
00:36:28,599 --> 00:36:32,760
any other

848
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:35,079
questions the quick question so you said

849
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:36,839
earlier that they're allowing the treaty

850
00:36:35,079 --> 00:36:39,079
to allow hemp for growing is that just

851
00:36:36,838 --> 00:36:41,239
for Europe and I mean how is this treaty

852
00:36:39,079 --> 00:36:43,280
like set up for the hemp says H hemp is

853
00:36:41,239 --> 00:36:46,598
not regulated under this treaty says

854
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:48,519
it's free for hemp and for medicine and

855
00:36:46,599 --> 00:36:53,359
for

856
00:36:48,519 --> 00:36:55,199
uh um Horticultural purposes so that

857
00:36:53,358 --> 00:36:57,960
part can be implemented immediately and

858
00:36:55,199 --> 00:36:59,960
isn't in Conflict those

859
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:02,559
oron do it do it even

860
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:05,119
matter right now there's no legal source

861
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:07,279
so yeah if there was a legal source of

862
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:08,838
cannabis technically here in Oregon

863
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,680
under schedule 2 it could be sold

864
00:37:08,838 --> 00:37:12,358
through

865
00:37:09,679 --> 00:37:14,239
pharmacies go ahead Bradley would you

866
00:37:12,358 --> 00:37:16,960
say that if octop pass that this would

867
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:19,598
be like the first true legalization law

868
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:22,720
passed like the last 41 years since the

869
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:25,039
War on Drugs started oh yeah the last uh

870
00:37:22,719 --> 00:37:29,559
M ever really because uh you know

871
00:37:25,039 --> 00:37:31,318
marijuana was Wild and Free uh until uh

872
00:37:29,559 --> 00:37:33,960
uh the mar first marijuana laws went

873
00:37:31,318 --> 00:37:37,559
into place you know and that was back uh

874
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:41,599
I guess the first one was 1914 in San

875
00:37:37,559 --> 00:37:43,639
Antonio oh no El Paso in El Paso Texas

876
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:45,240
and then uh you know the federal

877
00:37:43,639 --> 00:37:47,000
government passed it in and it was the

878
00:37:45,239 --> 00:37:48,838
states passing it making federal

879
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,400
government followed suit so this just

880
00:37:48,838 --> 00:37:52,519
goes to show you we can turn it around

881
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:54,639
in the same way yeah alcohol prohibition

882
00:37:52,519 --> 00:37:57,920
was overturned the same way you know

883
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:59,838
Oregon passed uh an initiative to to

884
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:02,680
remove all the penalties and legalize

885
00:37:59,838 --> 00:38:05,279
the sale of alcohol in 1932 but the fets

886
00:38:02,679 --> 00:38:07,199
didn't do it until 33 the state of New

887
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:11,160
York passed it and said took all the

888
00:38:07,199 --> 00:38:15,598
laws off alcohol sale and production in

889
00:38:11,159 --> 00:38:19,279
1927 so uh this is uh I want to you one

890
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:19,280
thing the states will lead the feds will

891
00:38:19,318 --> 00:38:23,199
follow somebody knows we got two other

892
00:38:21,559 --> 00:38:25,480
initiatives in two other states in

893
00:38:23,199 --> 00:38:27,598
Washington Colorado they tried in Ohio

894
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:30,599
and a couple other places Michigan you

895
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:32,599
know Missi didn't quite happen but but

896
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:34,760
we've got legalization initiatives for

897
00:38:32,599 --> 00:38:36,440
the people to vote on in three states

898
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:38,000
and I'm sure you support all of them CU

899
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:40,119
this is going to make it an even larger

900
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,358
mandate right on that's exactly right

901
00:38:40,119 --> 00:38:42,640
that's exactly right I support all of

902
00:38:41,358 --> 00:38:44,119
them there you know I just came from the

903
00:38:42,639 --> 00:38:47,400
Seattle HP fest last week and there are

904
00:38:44,119 --> 00:38:49,400
a lot of people talking bad about i502

905
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:51,480
there because of certain Provisions in

906
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:53,280
it you know if you're one of those guys

907
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:54,719
locked up in prison for life without the

908
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:57,119
possibility of parole or one of those

909
00:38:54,719 --> 00:39:00,919
poor souls in Malaysia about to be hung

910
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:03,800
for possessing 200 g or more marijuana

911
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:05,599
and you hear it failed because somebody

912
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:07,920
didn't like the fact they' make a little

913
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:10,440
bit less money on it that's that's evil

914
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:11,960
in my book you know we want to free it

915
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:14,119
so I support all of them and

916
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:15,920
unequivocally you know uh I didn't like

917
00:39:14,119 --> 00:39:20,160
all the provisions in Prop 19 in

918
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:22,119
California but I supported that and uh

919
00:39:20,159 --> 00:39:23,799
uh I'm not going to quibble with the

920
00:39:22,119 --> 00:39:26,039
folks in Washington if they make it

921
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:27,599
legal for an adult to possess an ounce

922
00:39:26,039 --> 00:39:28,318
they make it legal for an adult to buy

923
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:31,359
an

924
00:39:28,318 --> 00:39:33,239
outs that's a step forward in my book

925
00:39:31,358 --> 00:39:36,400
some might ask why are you doing this as

926
00:39:33,239 --> 00:39:38,959
you said earlier uh the OM may may go

927
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:40,720
away and you have these clinics and you

928
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:43,119
some you're shooting yourself in the

929
00:39:40,719 --> 00:39:45,279
foot right well in a way I am but I am

930
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:46,920
also a big believer that uh you got to

931
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:50,079
embrace change if you think you're going

932
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:52,280
to do the same thing you're doing today

933
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:53,839
next week next month next year 10 years

934
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:55,760
from now at some point you're going to

935
00:39:53,838 --> 00:39:57,559
be really sadly disappointed because

936
00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:00,599
it's the world's changing and it's going

937
00:39:57,559 --> 00:40:03,358
to change faster and faster in the near

938
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:05,400
future I really believe that marijuana

939
00:40:03,358 --> 00:40:08,199
is a bell weather issue for the future

940
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:10,240
of freedom and that it's really about

941
00:40:08,199 --> 00:40:14,199
freedom of thought and freedom of

942
00:40:10,239 --> 00:40:16,279
Consciousness and right now freedom is

943
00:40:14,199 --> 00:40:18,679
under attack you know they say

944
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:21,480
corporations have more rights than human

945
00:40:18,679 --> 00:40:23,960
beings in this citizens united ruling

946
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:26,559
well you know in the near future we're

947
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:27,920
going to see an exponential growth in

948
00:40:26,559 --> 00:40:31,239
biological

949
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:33,159
technology genetics and genomic science

950
00:40:31,239 --> 00:40:33,959
an exponential growth in convergence

951
00:40:33,159 --> 00:40:36,159
with

952
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:38,358
nanotechnology miniaturization of

953
00:40:36,159 --> 00:40:41,759
machines and processes and an

954
00:40:38,358 --> 00:40:43,838
exponential growth in uh artificial

955
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:47,119
intelligence and that those will all

956
00:40:43,838 --> 00:40:50,039
merge together and if we don't establish

957
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:52,200
a natural individual's right to think

958
00:40:50,039 --> 00:40:54,358
the thoughts we want to think to

959
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:57,318
experience the Consciousness we want to

960
00:40:54,358 --> 00:41:00,279
experience the dystopian possibilities

961
00:40:57,318 --> 00:41:03,318
in the future are Grim I mean things

962
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:05,519
like uh the Terminator The Matrix those

963
00:41:03,318 --> 00:41:09,759
all come into the realm of reality we

964
00:41:05,519 --> 00:41:12,119
have to expand natural individual rights

965
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:14,880
and marijuana is a bellweather and a

966
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:17,318
start of that but we have to have a

967
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:19,240
right to privacy we have to make sure

968
00:41:17,318 --> 00:41:21,079
that natural individuals have more

969
00:41:19,239 --> 00:41:23,318
rights than artificial ones like

970
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:25,720
corporations and in the future

971
00:41:23,318 --> 00:41:28,519
artificial intelligence

972
00:41:25,719 --> 00:41:30,719
Liberty it really is about freedom and

973
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:33,759
the future of freedom and I think

974
00:41:30,719 --> 00:41:35,838
marijuana is a bell weather issue that

975
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:38,319
is uh few people see you know they've

976
00:41:35,838 --> 00:41:41,480
used marijuana laws against the

977
00:41:38,318 --> 00:41:45,358
activists in the 50s and 60s they were

978
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:49,440
working for to stop the wars and uh it's

979
00:41:45,358 --> 00:41:49,440
really about uh freedom
