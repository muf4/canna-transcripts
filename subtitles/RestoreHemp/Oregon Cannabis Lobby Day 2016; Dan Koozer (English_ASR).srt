1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,279
I had a friend of mine it's awesome

2
00:00:02,908 --> 00:00:10,379
sufficient and for me for real and she

3
00:00:08,279 --> 00:00:12,329
her doctor told her that if he continued

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:14,839
to use medical marijuana he wasn't going

5
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:17,490
to be able to give her her prescription

6
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:21,390
painkillers so she's gonna have to make

7
00:00:17,489 --> 00:00:24,479
a choice and she asked me this is before

8
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:27,420
the merger 91 past she asked me she said

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:30,778
well measure 91 help in my situation if

10
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:32,880
it passes and I said no he won't give me

11
00:00:30,778 --> 00:00:34,590
it'll help in the long run but it won't

12
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,390
help in the short run because he won't

13
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:42,120
change a thing for part of your concern

14
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:43,620
and when I left she had a cheered I mean

15
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:45,209
he's not a judge right she had children

16
00:00:43,619 --> 00:00:48,000
on her cheek gonna laugh I mean it was

17
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:50,460
just really tragic so these are the kind

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,640
of thing to keep me going you know as an

19
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:57,770
activist it's been almost 20 years that

20
00:00:53,640 --> 00:01:01,289
Jon Jon's got me started his fault but

21
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:02,910
almost 20 years ago and i miss Yun all

22
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:04,710
the way in for many reasons one thing

23
00:01:02,909 --> 00:01:06,329
was I would ask John when was that and

24
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:08,129
he would tell me the date and how many

25
00:01:06,329 --> 00:01:10,530
years ago was I mean he was up on

26
00:01:08,129 --> 00:01:14,129
numbers and you know I don't remember it

27
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:16,109
anyway the organ legislature my opinion

28
00:01:14,129 --> 00:01:17,640
has been a horrible job of implementing

29
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:21,478
the Oregon Medical Marijuana Program

30
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:24,930
since the any sense it began started out

31
00:01:21,478 --> 00:01:28,319
by having an a credible director and

32
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:29,939
then didn't give her the facility what

33
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:32,519
you needed to do the job and then fired

34
00:01:29,938 --> 00:01:34,889
if you wasn't doing the job and that was

35
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:39,478
just the beginning they stolen money

36
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:42,478
from the patients supposedly it was X

37
00:01:39,478 --> 00:01:45,929
amount of dollars / how many patients

38
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:48,390
and babas to work out well the state is

39
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:50,750
making money on and the Morrigan medical

40
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:53,430
marijuana program and want some more

41
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:55,828
including a two hundred fifty dollar fee

42
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:58,469
for each drawer I mean come on this is

43
00:01:55,828 --> 00:02:01,500
ridiculous we've got to fight so anyway

44
00:01:58,468 --> 00:02:03,328
I got to get out of here so I appreciate

45
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:06,359
you coming I really appreciate everybody

46
00:02:03,328 --> 00:02:07,099
to show it up we've got to do more of

47
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:09,139
this because

48
00:02:07,099 --> 00:02:10,788
got to see the numbers it makes a

49
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:14,379
difference it's just like cart support

50
00:02:10,788 --> 00:02:14,379
it makes a difference thanks a lot
