1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,240
you know in 40 Years of doing this i'

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:09,120
I've learned not to uh set deadlines uh

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,240
there were times before like 1978 when

4
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:13,638
we thought we had this thing in the bag

5
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:16,399
uh and then events beyond our control

6
00:00:13,638 --> 00:00:19,839
intervene um and in some cases we didn't

7
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:22,038
do such a good job and things changed so

8
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:24,000
I I don't like to set timelines but we

9
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:27,920
all know where we're going to end up

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,439
right yeah we all know where we're going

11
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,960
right okay so it's just a matter putting

12
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:34,679
one foot in front of the other until we

13
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,920
get there we're definitely going to get

14
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:38,920
there we know

15
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,920
that
