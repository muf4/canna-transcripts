1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,480
I'm a science nut and I look at the

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:08,200
endoc canabo system the marijuana like

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:10,638
compounds that we make and I look at how

4
00:00:08,199 --> 00:00:12,558
they've participated in evolution to the

5
00:00:10,638 --> 00:00:14,279
point that we have humanity and we have

6
00:00:12,558 --> 00:00:17,118
us standing here and sitting here

7
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:20,118
talking about it and what that direction

8
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:23,320
means is and shows is that we have to

9
00:00:20,118 --> 00:00:26,439
increase our canabo activity that's the

10
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:29,039
way Nature has occurred up to now and

11
00:00:26,439 --> 00:00:31,320
now we have the ability to self-reflect

12
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:34,039
see how we got here and know where we

13
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:36,520
can go and that's why it's totally

14
00:00:34,039 --> 00:00:38,600
Unstoppable it's just a matter of time

15
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:41,680
because all we're doing is the Natural

16
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:44,079
Evolution of Life on this planet and the

17
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:46,640
critical role that this plant has in

18
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:49,120
being able to tweak our endocan avonoid

19
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,558
system and to create a world of people

20
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:56,799
who are more High rather than having it

21
00:00:51,558 --> 00:00:56,799
run by people who are less High yeah
