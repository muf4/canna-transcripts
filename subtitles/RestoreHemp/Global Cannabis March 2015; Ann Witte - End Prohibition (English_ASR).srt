1
00:00:01,078 --> 00:00:06,080
I'm here to talk just a little bit about

2
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:10,019
The Hemp stock

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:12,240
we've been denied the permit to to put

4
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:13,138
on him stock this year some you probably

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,440
know

6
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:19,079
so we asked the court to review the

7
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:20,220
decision-making process of the Park

8
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:23,759
Service

9
00:00:20,219 --> 00:00:26,460
it sounds to me like hearing Madeline

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,720
here today hearing her say don't smoke

11
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,300
marijuana

12
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:33,479
put your joint down that doesn't sound

13
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:35,340
like the Madeline I know it sounds to me

14
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:36,539
like her Free Speech rights have been

15
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:40,260
tampered with

16
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:43,200
just like Paul Stanford's were

17
00:00:40,259 --> 00:00:44,939
told what to say from the stage now by

18
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,460
the city

19
00:00:44,939 --> 00:00:50,280
but we filed a

20
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:51,239
suit for a reader review and we argued

21
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,859
it

22
00:00:51,238 --> 00:00:55,439
last week

23
00:00:52,859 --> 00:00:58,198
had a few a little flurry of

24
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:59,939
brief writing after that we should get a

25
00:00:58,198 --> 00:01:03,058
decision next week whether there will be

26
00:00:59,939 --> 00:01:05,819
a Hemp stock 2015 or not

27
00:01:03,058 --> 00:01:09,899
but the reason it was denied is because

28
00:01:05,819 --> 00:01:11,478
some people smoked marijuana down on the

29
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:15,719
waterfront

30
00:01:11,478 --> 00:01:18,299
so that's probably why Madeline is

31
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:21,900
having to warn you guys the city can

32
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:25,320
crack down on us anytime free speech in

33
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:27,680
the state of Oregon however we have a

34
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:29,879
constitutional amendment

35
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,520
constitutional provision it's not even

36
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:35,459
an amendment

37
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:38,519
and there's a similar case

38
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:39,839
under the federal law out of out of

39
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:42,239
Ferguson

40
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,000
it seemed that the police officers in

41
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:47,578
Ferguson were telling people to move

42
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,438
along Move Along Move Along keep moving

43
00:01:47,578 --> 00:01:51,179
you can't stand here and talk about the

44
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:52,798
shootings you can't talk about

45
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:55,020
government you can't talk about anything

46
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,840
just keep moving keep moving

47
00:01:55,019 --> 00:02:00,599
so they sued in federal court and just

48
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:03,180
quite recently last year

49
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:05,519
the federal court said no you can't make

50
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:08,640
people just keep moving along

51
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:11,280
the reason is it doesn't work

52
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:13,738
it's not narrowly tailored to solve your

53
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,318
problems it just stops them talking and

54
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:18,180
you can't stop people from saying what

55
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:20,519
they want to say

56
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:23,099
I'm hoping that that's the same result

57
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:24,840
we'll have next week and that we'll all

58
00:02:23,098 --> 00:02:28,560
be volunteering and planning for him

59
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:30,900
stock meanwhile keep speaking

60
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,199
because that's what got us here thank

61
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,200
you all
