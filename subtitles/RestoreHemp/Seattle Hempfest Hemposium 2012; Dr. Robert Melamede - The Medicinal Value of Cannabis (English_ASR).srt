1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,879
uh the White House put out a statement

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:06,839
that there's no medical value for

3
00:00:03,879 --> 00:00:08,880
marijuana but yet uh we know from

4
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:11,120
studies and from the work of patients at

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:14,000
a time things that you've Unearthed and

6
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:16,160
do and that's not true we know from El M

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,079
who's getting her medication from the

8
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,879
government that they realize that there

9
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:22,959
is some truth to what we say so how do

10
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:24,759
we take a bright mind like Obama and the

11
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:28,080
White House Administration and make them

12
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:31,439
realize publicly publicly that there is

13
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:33,640
a medical value to this plan

14
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,799
um what they always Resort back to is

15
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:37,439
the lack of peer-reviewed studies where

16
00:00:35,799 --> 00:00:39,519
there are literally I've got about

17
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:42,000
10,000 peer-reviewed studies on my

18
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,280
computer dealing with cannabis but what

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,238
they for the most part they're not

20
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,840
dealing with smoke marijuana other than

21
00:00:45,238 --> 00:00:50,280
early studies from the 70s but there are

22
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,960
a few and more coming out now dealing

23
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,640
with smoke or with extracts and one just

24
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,198
came out last week from Germany

25
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,960
basically challenging the whole idea of

26
00:00:57,198 --> 00:01:01,439
what the federal government is doing

27
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:04,400
because there is documented medical

28
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:07,158
value I think the only thing that really

29
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:09,840
makes politicians listen is when their

30
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:13,080
constituency contacts them directly

31
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,560
phone email more importantly sometimes

32
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:17,759
postcards and then they start to see or

33
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:19,799
visiting them that's what they start to

34
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,280
listen to when they realize that their

35
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:25,479
positions are in Jeopardy if they don't

36
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:27,640
follow the correct you know Direction

37
00:01:25,478 --> 00:01:30,599
really and I think that that's starting

38
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:32,359
to happen more and more because I having

39
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:36,118
spent too much time this summer in

40
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:38,560
Washington DC I Now understand much more

41
00:01:36,118 --> 00:01:41,078
of how this how the game is played and

42
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,280
if we can all learn how to play the game

43
00:01:41,078 --> 00:01:45,599
better then we're going to have a

44
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,960
magnified impact on changing things

45
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:49,718
quicker and easier so I think it's up to

46
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:52,639
the voice of the people to make it

47
00:01:49,718 --> 00:01:52,640
happen
