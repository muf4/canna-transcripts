1
00:01:58,728 --> 00:02:04,319
but having 50 plus the fisheries bring

2
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:06,539
up all around the state defense that we

3
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:08,039
were putting pressure on the legislators

4
00:02:06,539 --> 00:02:10,050
have to be able to come to the table to

5
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:12,119
say how do we control this now they're

6
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:16,250
invested and now we have to deal with

7
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:19,349
that this is the next step in that level

8
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:20,729
30 grow gardens is proud to have made

9
00:02:19,349 --> 00:02:22,650
that Stephanie if the create

10
00:02:20,729 --> 00:02:24,209
dispensaries you're going to save access

11
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:25,950
for patients we didn't want to own it

12
00:02:24,209 --> 00:02:28,110
all these one to create the availability

13
00:02:25,949 --> 00:02:29,939
of it now we're really really excited

14
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:31,620
about the fact of giving these seats

15
00:02:29,939 --> 00:02:34,409
away to everyone in the state of Oregon

16
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:35,909
is beyond because we feel safer if our

17
00:02:34,409 --> 00:02:38,310
neighbor has more plants in their

18
00:02:35,909 --> 00:02:41,459
backyard it's not competitive for me as

19
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:43,590
a producer as a reader or at a grower to

20
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:45,420
be the only guy on the block we really

21
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:49,409
want everyone to be able to have this

22
00:02:45,419 --> 00:02:51,149
opportunity to experience it give it a

23
00:02:49,409 --> 00:02:52,889
try and we're going to make that

24
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:56,090
experience available and we feel that as

25
00:02:52,889 --> 00:02:56,089
we need a much safer world
