1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:05,680
I'd much rather be here listening to

2
00:00:02,839 --> 00:00:09,280
Bobby plator and talk than to be talking

3
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:11,839
here on his behalf but unfortunately our

4
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:15,320
prohibition policies are such that you

5
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:17,118
cannot even educate as to an alternative

6
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,600
you cannot even teach people there's

7
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:23,000
another way to think about this issue so

8
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:25,800
unfortunately I'm here and Bobby's not

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,759
but what Bobby's message is is critical

10
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,719
to winning this issue if you care about

11
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:33,920
this if you care about being a to come

12
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:36,399
outside go by the Waterfront use

13
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,039
marijuana publicly with your friends

14
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:41,000
with your family without fear of

15
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:42,479
provocation without fear of harassment

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,759
then you need to be involved in the

17
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:47,558
issue of ending prohibition and if you

18
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:50,519
are a senior you need to be involved in

19
00:00:47,558 --> 00:00:52,959
this issue I will say it once we cannot

20
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:56,079
win this issue without seniors on

21
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:59,600
board we cannot win this issue without

22
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:01,679
seniors on board so you right here if

23
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,519
you have grandparents if you have

24
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:07,040
parents if you have family friends you

25
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:09,560
cannot be afraid to approach them and

26
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:12,200
talk to them about this issue you have

27
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:14,280
to be a voice you have to educate

28
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:16,040
yourself you have to educate your

29
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:19,040
parents you have to educate your

30
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:21,439
grandparents because they vote they

31
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:24,240
donate they give money they have

32
00:01:21,438 --> 00:01:25,679
influence and if they get on board this

33
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:27,959
thing will happen it will happen in

34
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,960
Oregon it will happen in Colorado and it

35
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:31,359
will happen in Washington and after this

36
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:32,879
November we'll go after the rest of the

37
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:34,478
states in this Union we'll legalize

38
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:36,719
