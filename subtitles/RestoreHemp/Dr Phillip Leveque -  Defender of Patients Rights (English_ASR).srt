1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:05,119
so what is the actual state right now Dr

2
00:00:03,198 --> 00:00:06,759
rebec of medical marijuana here in

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,800
Oregon

4
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:14,638
well what's going on right now is that

5
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:16,719
um a person who wants to use medical

6
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:18,198
marijuana and another words has a

7
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:20,839
disease

8
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:23,439
process uh which includes wasting

9
00:00:20,839 --> 00:00:25,679
disease of AIDS multiple

10
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:29,560
sclerosis

11
00:00:25,678 --> 00:00:34,000
glaucoma and uh some people even use it

12
00:00:29,559 --> 00:00:38,878
for various and sunry types of pain

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:42,920
problems and um there is

14
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:45,960
virtually uh in in particular in regard

15
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:48,320
to pain pain is so subjective that

16
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,759
there's no way for somebody to

17
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,198
measure uh the degree of pain or the

18
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:54,839
intensity of pain or even the relief of

19
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:57,640
pain or anything else there just there

20
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:00,680
just no way to do this but if a person

21
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:04,519
says I have a bad back or I have a bad

22
00:01:00,679 --> 00:01:08,759
this or a bad that and I'm in pain and

23
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:11,400
uh that uh smoking marijuana helps I I

24
00:01:08,759 --> 00:01:13,840
don't think that anybody should deny

25
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,640
them the right to use that now what's

26
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:20,320
going on in Oregon at the present time

27
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:22,840
is that people who who are using

28
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:25,559
marijuana for medical purposes have to

29
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:27,159
get some sort of a letter from a

30
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:32,399
physician which

31
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:35,640
says uh marijuana will alleviate the the

32
00:01:32,399 --> 00:01:38,439
problem pain or whatever it might be for

33
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:42,719
this individual this letter is sent to

34
00:01:38,438 --> 00:01:45,438
the uh uh Oregon Health

35
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:49,879
division uh Dr Grant

36
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:54,319
higginson is the person who uh who is

37
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:55,599
the U I guess U he's not the director of

38
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:58,919
the Oregon Health division but he's a

39
00:01:55,599 --> 00:02:00,759
number two person there and and the

40
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:05,359
number one person is not a physician but

41
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:08,080
he is so he is the one who to whom these

42
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:10,560
letters are addressed and he is the one

43
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:14,160
who will issue the equivalent of a

44
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:16,400
marijuana user's license now the strange

45
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:19,878
thing about it is that it is still a

46
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:24,080
federal offense to in many respects

47
00:02:19,878 --> 00:02:25,679
about the use of marijuana so no at the

48
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,000
present time nobody knows what's going

49
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,920
to happen but this hasn't prevented

50
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,680
people who get uh benefit from the use

51
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:36,000
of marijuana from using it there are an

52
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,959
estimated 100,000 people in the United

53
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,519
States right now who admit to using it

54
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:43,080
for medical purposes and there are

55
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:46,719
probably as I understand at around 10

56
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:51,519
people 10 million people excuse me who

57
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:54,840
who uh use marijuana recreationally

58
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:57,158
now this is I think the so-called

59
00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:00,640
recreational use of this is a kind of a

60
00:02:57,158 --> 00:03:03,439
poor term because I don't think people

61
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:07,559
smoke tobacco for recreational purposes

62
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:10,239
I I I I I I I don't I don't know why

63
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:12,400
people smoke tobacco but whether it's

64
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:15,799
for recreational purposes or whatever it

65
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:18,319
is this is a sort of a strange uh

66
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:21,159
terminology that that is

67
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:23,280
used uh so it's like when they use

68
00:03:21,158 --> 00:03:25,439
alcohol that's social drinking or

69
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,519
something right well I suppose that

70
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:30,359
that's that's true I've never heard of

71
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:33,000
the social recreational use of alcohol

72
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:35,959
yeah recreation use of alcohol and the

73
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,919
social use of marijuana so the the the

74
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:41,640
terminology here is very very obscure or

75
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:44,559
muddied or whatever the right word is

76
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:46,318
imprecise at the least absolutely now I

77
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,280
think one of the strangest things about

78
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:53,318
this is that the federal government

79
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:56,598
raises marijuana yes in Mississippi the

80
00:03:53,318 --> 00:03:59,919
federal government has it

81
00:03:56,598 --> 00:04:02,878
harvested and processed to make

82
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:06,280
marijuana cigarettes and there are eight

83
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:09,399
people in the United States who have uh

84
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:11,000
letters of permission from the U Drug

85
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:13,360
Enforcement

86
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,079
Administration to use marijuana for

87
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:19,439
their medical

88
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:23,280
purposes now if eight people can use it

89
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:26,918
for medical purposes for relief of their

90
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:30,478
medical problem why can't nine or 10 or

91
00:04:26,918 --> 00:04:32,439
a thousand use it so it it's it's a very

92
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:37,719
very strange

93
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:41,680
situation and uh a year and a half ago I

94
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:45,479
was one of six doctors who testified at

95
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:48,400
the American Medical Association

96
00:04:45,478 --> 00:04:50,120
Convention uh

97
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:53,000
for

98
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:56,519
for the American Medical

99
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:59,360
Association to uh stand behind the

100
00:04:56,519 --> 00:05:00,198
rights of patients to use marijuana for

101
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,319
medical

102
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:04,400
purposes and this was passed by the

103
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:06,319
house of delegates of of the American

104
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:08,560
Medical Association in

105
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:11,560
Dallas um

106
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,160
the headquarters of the American Medical

107
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:15,439
Association

108
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:18,000
has I don't know whether the word is

109
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:19,879
they've sat on their hands or sat on

110
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,959
their heads or whatever they've done but

111
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:28,000
they haven't done anything about it and

112
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:29,680
uh we six doctors have uh written a

113
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,918
letter to the Journal of the American

114
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,079
American Medical

115
00:05:30,918 --> 00:05:37,079
Association uh as the equivalent of a

116
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:40,198
letter to the editor asking why hasn't

117
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:43,399
the American uh Medical Association

118
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:46,879
taken a stand on this well the first

119
00:05:43,399 --> 00:05:48,638
letter we wrote uh they sent back that

120
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:51,240
we're sorry but we're rejecting it

121
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:53,560
because we have too many other things to

122
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:58,079
print in the magazine or something like

123
00:05:53,560 --> 00:06:00,478
that and then about 6 weeks ago the

124
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:02,399
American what what is it The Institute

125
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:04,680
of medicine Institute of medicine The

126
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:06,318
Institute of medic Academy of Science

127
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:10,680
from the National Academy of Science

128
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:13,598
came out uh very highly publicized

129
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:16,400
throughout the United States that there

130
00:06:13,598 --> 00:06:20,120
was considerable evidence that marijuana

131
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:22,198
was good for certain medical medical

132
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:25,000
problems and

133
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:28,240
um uh the American Medical Association

134
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:32,639
has been strangely quiet about this but

135
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:35,639
in view of the Institute of medicine we

136
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:38,000
six doctors again wrote a letter to the

137
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:39,360
American Medical Association and the

138
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,199
Journal of the American Medical

139
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,160
Association

140
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:46,960
say The Institute of medicine says that

141
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:49,800
it has some benefit in medical purposes

142
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:52,038
and why should um why should people who

143
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:56,598
use it be thrown in jail for using it

144
00:06:52,038 --> 00:06:58,878
for medical reasons so um as somebody

145
00:06:56,598 --> 00:07:04,079
pointed out a few minutes ago we are at

146
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:06,919
the cutting AE edge of this and uh with

147
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:09,279
the vote U I guess the last two

148
00:07:06,918 --> 00:07:11,478
elections we had for medical for us

149
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:15,359
medical marijuana yeah November of 98

150
00:07:11,478 --> 00:07:18,120
here in Oregon and Washington and uh

151
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:22,080
Arizona Arizona they voted on it for the

152
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:24,680
second time they originally voted in uh

153
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:25,839
1996 along with California to legalize

154
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:28,560
medical

155
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:31,159
marijuana and I think I think if I

156
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:34,478
understand right there are Six States

157
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:37,479
who have passed initiatives is that what

158
00:07:34,478 --> 00:07:40,639
it is or yes six and then uh that's not

159
00:07:37,478 --> 00:07:42,439
counting the District of Colombia where

160
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,680
uh the United States Federal Congress

161
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:47,839
has not allowed that vote to be counted

162
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:50,840
exit poll showed that it passed with

163
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:53,439
72% but uh an amendment to an

164
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:58,959
Appropriations writer by Georgia

165
00:07:53,439 --> 00:08:01,598
Representative Bob bar uh defunded the

166
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:04,198
county of that vote and said that the

167
00:08:01,598 --> 00:08:05,959
District of Columbia cannot count the

168
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:09,240
vote on medical marijuana that was on

169
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:11,758
their ballot well so Dr Beck I mean

170
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:13,079
Florida state is there every day you

171
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,759
know we find out new information about

172
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:17,359
drugs that existed for a long time I

173
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:19,240
mean it's not like the book is closed

174
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,919
you know once they come out with a drug

175
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:24,879
at the first place well I think it's

176
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:28,719
very interesting that we know

177
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:30,879
from historical records that that can

178
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,479
cannabis has been used for literally

179
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:37,080
thousands of

180
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:40,080
years and nobody has ever reported any

181
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:42,440
bad effects from the use of it yeah and

182
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:47,200
and when you compare that to Tobacco or

183
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:50,480
to alcohol MH uh there's absolutely no

184
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:52,640
comparison between between tobacco

185
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,480
alcohol and marijuana they're just

186
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:58,360
absolutely none

187
00:08:54,480 --> 00:09:01,320
whatsoever and and uh the statement that

188
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:05,000
um that marijuana is a gateway drug to

189
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:08,600
heroin or cocaine or whatever uh this

190
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,559
was uh verbally thed by The Institute of

191
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:15,200
medicine that said there was no evidence

192
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:17,759
whatsoever that this was the case so um

193
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:20,079
I think I think the main thing that

194
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:22,319
we're doing is supporting General

195
00:09:20,078 --> 00:09:25,000
mccaffery and a whole bunch of DEA

196
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:27,920
agents who are making very high salaries

197
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:31,078
and don't want to give up the the the

198
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:33,319
game as you might might say so the

199
00:09:31,078 --> 00:09:36,439
people that are making money uh on the

200
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:39,399
marijuana issue are the DEA agents and

201
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:42,959
the people who grow and sell

202
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:47,440
marijuana uh and don't uh don't pay any

203
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:49,799
taxes on any aspect of of the money that

204
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:52,600
they make and if they're

205
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:55,679
caught they get sent to a federal prison

206
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:58,720
where it costs at least $40,000 a year

207
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:59,958
to keep them in prison so I guess the

208
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,959
federal prison

209
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:04,000
uh the guards in the prisons are

210
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:06,159
probably also recipients of a lot of

211
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,399
money from the marijuana business so

212
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:11,278
it's really a straight strange

213
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:14,240
absolutely bizarre situation that that

214
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:16,559
uh this has gone on and I can't

215
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,919
understand why some of these uh

216
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:21,919
politicians in Washington DC and

217
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:24,360
elsewhere can't see this or understand

218
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:27,559
it or whatever the right word is I don't

219
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,560
I don't understand it
