1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,719
how high are you I mean hi how are you

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:09,120

agenda podcast check it out on iTunes

7
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:21,570
and all other outlets I've traveled all

8
00:00:19,528 --> 00:00:23,399
across North America these past thirteen

9
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:25,109
years fighting for the end of adult

10
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:27,868
marijuana prohibition and I'm happy to

11
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:34,200
say it is a beautiful day to be here in

12
00:00:27,868 --> 00:00:36,480
legal pot land Oregon yeah so maybe

13
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:39,530
you're thinking though marijuana is

14
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:41,279
legal so what do we got to March about

15
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:44,160
that's a good question

16
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:47,460
when this March first started in 1999

17
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:49,699
there were no legal states and there

18
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:52,859
were only five medical marijuana States

19
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:56,270
when I started doing this March in 2005

20
00:00:52,859 --> 00:01:00,960
two out of three people nationwide

21
00:00:56,270 --> 00:01:03,049
opposed legalization of marijuana today

22
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,180
two out of three people nationwide

23
00:01:03,048 --> 00:01:08,819
support the legalization of marijuana we

24
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:11,970
have nine legal states we have 29

25
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:13,919
medical marijuana states we have 17 CBD

26
00:01:11,969 --> 00:01:16,769
only states we're down to just four

27
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:19,710
states in America that have absolute

28
00:01:16,769 --> 00:01:27,019
cannabis prohibition so we've made a lot

29
00:01:19,709 --> 00:01:30,449
of progress but folks legal ain't equal

30
00:01:27,019 --> 00:01:35,429
legal eight equal we can still lose our

31
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:37,680
jobs for smoking legal marijuana we can

32
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:41,549
still have our gun rights denied for

33
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:44,399
smoking legal marijuana we can still

34
00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:48,780
have our children taken away for us for

35
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:51,390
legal marijuana and we still have no

36
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:55,310
public place where we can gather with

37
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:58,710
other adults and smoke legal marijuana

38
00:01:55,310 --> 00:02:02,009
so folks legal ain't equal in our

39
00:01:58,709 --> 00:02:05,099
personal lives and legal ain't equal in

40
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:08,520
our business lives I'd like to quote my

41
00:02:05,099 --> 00:02:11,430
friend Jody Emery in Canada who said we

42
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,469
thought legalization meant the existing

43
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:15,960
marijuana industry would be

44
00:02:13,469 --> 00:02:18,419
legal but that's not what's happening

45
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:21,060
we're finding a legalization industry

46
00:02:18,419 --> 00:02:23,299
that's squeezing out the family farmer

47
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:26,189
that's squeezing out the minority

48
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:29,130
distributor that's right folks

49
00:02:26,189 --> 00:02:30,990
blacks and hippies did the time but

50
00:02:29,129 --> 00:02:35,780
whites and yuppies are making the dimes

51
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:35,780
and that's something we need to change

52
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:41,159
we heard a lot as we were trying to

53
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:45,270
legalize marijuana about treat marijuana

54
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:48,509
like alcohol treat marijuana like

55
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:51,810
alcohol but legal alcohol can take

56
00:02:48,509 --> 00:02:56,340
business deductions on their taxes that

57
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:57,959
legal marijuana can't take legal alcohol

58
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:00,420
doesn't have to worry about its bank

59
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:03,629
accounts getting closed but legal

60
00:03:00,419 --> 00:03:05,509
marijuana does and legal alcohol doesn't

61
00:03:03,629 --> 00:03:11,359
have to worry about federal interference

62
00:03:05,509 --> 00:03:14,609
but legal marijuana does legal aid equal

63
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:16,320
especially on this Cinco de Mayo when

64
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:19,410
right down there at Tom McCall

65
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:22,049
Waterfront Park the place is packed with

66
00:03:19,409 --> 00:03:25,049
parents and children at a place that is

67
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:27,390
sponsored a three-day outdoor drinking

68
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:30,719
festival sponsored by Modelo and

69
00:03:27,389 --> 00:03:33,389
speciale Corona extra Negra Modelo and

70
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:35,509
cerveza Pacifico that you can drink

71
00:03:33,389 --> 00:03:38,039
right out in the open in front of kids

72
00:03:35,509 --> 00:03:40,189
but right here in Pioneer Courthouse

73
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:44,840
Square for our marijuana festival

74
00:03:40,189 --> 00:03:49,620
marijuana is invisible so legal ain't

75
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:52,439
equal we also insisted that legalization

76
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:55,879
should not harm medical marijuana

77
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:59,509
we've said it three times in measure 91

78
00:03:55,879 --> 00:04:02,459
so what is the state doing denying

79
00:03:59,509 --> 00:04:05,340
out-of-state patient cards steep

80
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:08,400
reductions in growth sites invasive

81
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:11,459
tracking and inspections complex

82
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:15,120
regulations and exorbitant fees that are

83
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:16,858
driving growers out of the program these

84
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,319
drastic changes to the medical cannabis

85
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:21,149
program are unconscionable this state

86
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:23,819
charges $200

87
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:26,819
that's the highest fee in the 29 states

88
00:04:23,819 --> 00:04:29,219
that have medical marijuana for a second

89
00:04:26,819 --> 00:04:32,389
abled person to join a medical marijuana

90
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:35,520
program that's always run a surplus

91
00:04:32,389 --> 00:04:38,159
always run a surplus and then the state

92
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:41,879
goes and diverts money from that surplus

93
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:45,000
to balance the budget of other failing

94
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:47,159
bureaucracies then has the gall to come

95
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,639
back to our growers and say they got a

96
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,650
pain

97
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:52,259
what is it 40 bucks a month for some

98
00:04:49,649 --> 00:04:55,289
invasive tracking program they're so

99
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:57,750
messed up that they're driving growers

100
00:04:55,290 --> 00:05:02,100
out of this program we are marching

101
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:07,100
today because we got it legal but legal

102
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:10,530
a equal legal ain't equal of the olcc

103
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:13,920
they're so afraid of pot that they have

104
00:05:10,529 --> 00:05:16,409
devoted only twice as many resources to

105
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:19,230
the minor decoy operations the stings

106
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:21,630
try to get underaged buys twice as many

107
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:24,120
to alcohol as looted of marijuana but

108
00:05:21,629 --> 00:05:26,610
there are 10 times as many alcohol

109
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:28,920
outlets as there are marijuana outlets

110
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:31,020
and then they're shocked when they come

111
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:33,840
back and find in the past five decoy

112
00:05:31,019 --> 00:05:36,389
operations 100% compliance in the

113
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:39,029
marijuana side but they have nothing to

114
00:05:36,389 --> 00:05:42,240
say about the fact that in the last five

115
00:05:39,029 --> 00:05:45,179
alcohol decoy operations one out of

116
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:48,629
every eight teenagers was successfully

117
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:50,730
able to buy alcohol with a real ID with

118
00:05:48,629 --> 00:05:54,750
a red box around their head that says

119
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:56,670
they're not legal treat alchemy rowana

120
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:58,769
like alcohol we had a treat alcohol like

121
00:05:56,670 --> 00:06:02,009
marijuana we seem to be doing a much

122
00:05:58,769 --> 00:06:03,509
better job of controlling it and legal

123
00:06:02,009 --> 00:06:05,129
ain't equal to the Oregon Health

124
00:06:03,509 --> 00:06:07,319
Association either Oregon Health

125
00:06:05,129 --> 00:06:09,540
Administration they're so fearful of

126
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:11,969
gaming the system that they've turned

127
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:13,980
the system into an expensive game that

128
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:16,740
most growers don't want to play anymore

129
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:19,319
then they're upset when our patients who

130
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:22,259
can't find any return to the unregulated

131
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:24,480
untaxed underground market that OHA was

132
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:29,189
passing these laws to try to eliminate

133
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:31,350
in the first place and most of all legal

134
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:34,410
ain't equal to the Oregon Legislature

135
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:37,410
how else can you explain a Clean Air Act

136
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:39,540
that bans indoor smoking because we

137
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:40,710
proved secondhand tobacco smoke was

138
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:42,569
harmful

139
00:06:40,709 --> 00:06:45,180
but then it's amended by the legislature

140
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:48,509
to include cannabis vapor which has

141
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:50,939
never been proven to be harmful a Clean

142
00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:53,400
Air Act that offers an exception for

143
00:06:50,939 --> 00:06:56,009
cigar bars to allow to backhoe smoking

144
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:59,969
but doesn't allow an exemption for

145
00:06:56,009 --> 00:07:02,520
cannabis smoking legal ain't equal and I

146
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:06,600
say what the hell good is a right if you

147
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:09,418
got no place to exercise it we're

148
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:12,240
marching today because we want our equal

149
00:07:09,418 --> 00:07:14,698
rights we deserve to be treated with the

150
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:17,519
same decency and respect as any cigar

151
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:20,189
smoker any beer drinker any whiskey

152
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:21,810
chugger any chewing tobacco user we

153
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:23,459
deserve equal rights

154
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:25,079
if society's figured out how to

155
00:07:23,459 --> 00:07:27,120
accommodate the beer drinkers and

156
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:29,250
accommodate the cigar smokers they

157
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,769
should just apply those rules to us as

158
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:33,598
well any place I can smoke a cigar I

159
00:07:31,769 --> 00:07:35,430
should be able to smoke a joint any

160
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:37,589
place I can do a shot of whiskey I

161
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:41,579
