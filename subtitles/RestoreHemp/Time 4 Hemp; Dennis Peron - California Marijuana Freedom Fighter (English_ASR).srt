1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,678
Joining us today on the program was one

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:06,560
of San Francisco's hardest working

3
00:00:03,678 --> 00:00:09,679
activists, Dennis Peron. Dennis has been

4
00:00:06,559 --> 00:00:11,279
working in the uh gay gay community

5
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:13,120
trying to change and make a difference

6
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:16,358
for the people there as well as working

7
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:19,198
in the hemp community and his political

8
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:21,279
ideas and his political efforts have

9
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,840
made a change and an impact on that city

10
00:00:21,278 --> 00:00:25,359
that will last for its history. Dennis,

11
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:27,198
thank you for being on our show. Thank

12
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:29,279
you, Casper, for having me. One of the

13
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,279
things that uh I was talking about in

14
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:33,920
regards to the changing of history in

15
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:36,320
San Francisco is Proposition W. Some

16
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,320
people nationally are aware of it. Many

17
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:41,280
aren't. But what you did with

18
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,558
Proposition W is really a landmark.

19
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,719
Well, I'll tell you what happened. It

20
00:00:42,558 --> 00:00:50,479
was um Proposition W and Proposition P

21
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:54,160
ar uh arised out of a marijuana bus that

22
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:56,238
I had. I was busted in 1977. And I used

23
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:58,759
to run the Big Top Pot Supermarket.

24
00:00:56,238 --> 00:01:02,000
Okay. And it was a one-stop pot

25
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:05,039
supermarket, one-stop shop for all your

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,640
pot needs. Okay. And it was a very

27
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,640
elaborate setup. And uh when I came when

28
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,560
it came to San Francisco, I had trouble

29
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,439
buying pot and I had to like kiss a lot

30
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:18,000
of ass and I had a lot of uh hassles

31
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:20,719
getting pot. So I just decided to start

32
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,640
a pot supermarket myself. Well, sell pot

33
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:24,400
myself. had evolved into a supermarket

34
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,680
because there were so many different

35
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:30,280
kinds of pot and at that time and

36
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,640
different prices and everything. So I

37
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:34,960
um I tried to get as many different

38
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:39,200
kinds of pot together in one spot as I

39
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:41,679
could. Okay. And the um the idea grew

40
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:45,280
and grew and grew and before you knew it

41
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,640
I had three scales, 15 people working. I

42
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,478
had four people that all they did was

43
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,799
roll

44
00:01:47,478 --> 00:01:54,000
joints and um every night we would sell

45
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:57,200
pot to about five 600 people. It was a

46
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,118
very elaborate setup, beautiful house

47
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:03,000
and customers were treated with dignity

48
00:01:59,118 --> 00:02:06,718
and respect and no one was ever

49
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,159
jipped. In 1977, I got busted like I

50
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:12,799
said and

51
00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:15,919
uh we had a 4mon trial after I got

52
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:18,760
busted. I didn't mention that I I got

53
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:21,598
shot during that raid.

54
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:23,759
Um in the leg, right? Yeah, I got shot

55
00:02:21,598 --> 00:02:27,280
in the leg. Um what it was is the but

56
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:29,199
the supermarket was going down and uh I

57
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,520
heard a ruckus at the door and I went to

58
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:33,598
the the stairway to see what was going

59
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:36,599
on and I see this uh guy coming up with

60
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:39,359
a gun, big old floppy hat and fatigue

61
00:02:36,598 --> 00:02:41,359
jacket and I think the first thing I

62
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,000
think of course is a rip that these guys

63
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,840
are going to rob us. Mhm. So, the first

64
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,800
thing I do is grab something close by,

65
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:51,200
which was a MTL Hamburg water bottle,

66
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,959
and I hold it up the stairs like go down

67
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:56,439
the stairs and we'll forget all about

68
00:02:52,959 --> 00:03:00,479
this. But before I'd even got the bottle

69
00:02:56,439 --> 00:03:02,639
up, the guy had shot me. And he got me

70
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:05,518
with the first shot and threw me back.

71
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:07,199
And then another shot went past my ear.

72
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,439
And this was the point where I was

73
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:10,799
convinced that these guys were murderous

74
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,919
ripoffs, that they were going to kill

75
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,239
everybody in the house. So, I was

76
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:18,158
willing to give them everything I had.

77
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:21,920
Of course. Uh, the guy comes up the

78
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:24,560
stairs and puts a gun to my head and I'm

79
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:27,318
thinking that goodbye Dennis.

80
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:30,959
Fortunately, another guy comes in the

81
00:03:27,318 --> 00:03:33,280
room. And it turns out he's a cop. Turns

82
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,319
out they're all cops, much to my

83
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:39,598
surprise.

84
00:03:35,318 --> 00:03:41,679
Uh, so I was shot and I remember the day

85
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:45,039
that that day they were taking me out of

86
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,719
the u the house on a stretcher and out

87
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:49,039
in front of the house there was five or

88
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:51,359
6 hundred people that had gathered

89
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:54,719
around the house mainly my friends and

90
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:57,439
customers and when they took me out I

91
00:03:54,719 --> 00:04:00,120
shot a peace sign to those people and

92
00:03:57,438 --> 00:04:04,318
the whole street

93
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:05,680
screamed Dennis Dennis Dennis

94
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:08,000
That kind of support must have helped

95
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,680
you healed. And it did help me feel a

96
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,158
lot better even though I knew it was

97
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,879
kind of curtains for the big top. Yeah.

98
00:04:12,158 --> 00:04:16,560
That was an end of an era. And that's

99
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:18,000
when you brought forth Proposition W.

100
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,079
Now, what's Proposition W exactly?

101
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,720
Proposition W, like I said, aroused over

102
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:25,439
the bust. And I knew that people of San

103
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:28,800
Francisco wanted marijuana legal. I knew

104
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:31,439
that because we had a 1972 referendum on

105
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,759
Proposition 19. It was a statewide thing

106
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:34,759
where San Francisco voted 52% to

107
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,680
legalize

108
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:41,280
marijuana. So I and my friends went out

109
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:43,040
collected 16,000 signatures to put a

110
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:45,599
referendum on the ballot. It was a local

111
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,600
initiative, but it out and out legalized

112
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,120
marijuana for cultivation, sale,

113
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,560
possession, anything you wanted to do.

114
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,319
You wanted to take a bath in it, you

115
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,399
could do that. Okay. Now, wasn't that

116
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:57,839
contrary to federal? It's contrary to

117
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:59,599
state and federal. But um the way I see

118
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:01,359
it, San Francisco is very unique. It's a

119
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,520
city and a county. We elect our district

120
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,560
attorney. We elect our mayor. We elect

121
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:08,478
our board of supervisors. In many ways,

122
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,038
these people are responsible to us.

123
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:13,199
Okay. Also to state law, but to the

124
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:14,879
people that elected them. And so I

125
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,720
directed at the chief of police and the

126
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:18,800
district attorney. Seemed that those two

127
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:22,960
people were mainly involved in marijuana

128
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:26,038
prosecution and arrest. And um it won by

129
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:29,198
58%. Excellent. I collected those

130
00:05:26,038 --> 00:05:32,399
signatures just before I went into jail

131
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:36,560
on the big top pot supermarket bust. I

132
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:40,120
got 6 months and um while I was in jail,

133
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:42,319
there was an office opened for charter

134
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:44,720
commissioner. My friends got the papers

135
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:47,360
for me and before you knew it, I was a

136
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,919
candidate for office while I'm in jail

137
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,759
and also proposition W was given a

138
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:54,319
letter of designation and that was going

139
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:58,000
on. What a turnaround. I like to say

140
00:05:54,319 --> 00:06:00,560
most politicians um wind up in jail, but

141
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,800
I started my political career in jail.

142
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:07,759
So, I figured I'd skip a step.

143
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:10,079
Uh well, in November came around, I got

144
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:12,639
20,000 votes and came 300 votes shy of

145
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:16,800
winning the election. Wow. Proposition W

146
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:18,960
got over 58% of the vote uh to become

147
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,720
technically the law of San Francisco.

148
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:24,000
Okay. The will and the spirit of the

149
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:26,400
people. Well, I had allies in the um

150
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,319
political arena. My main ally was my

151
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:29,879
good friend Harvey Mil, the first gay

152
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,160
case supervisor ever elected in the

153
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:34,719
nation. And my other ally was George

154
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,639
Moscone, the liberal mayor of San

155
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,199
Francisco, who was a friend of the gay

156
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:41,439
community, who was a friend of the

157
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:43,439
ptheads. And he was just a friend of the

158
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:46,240
the uh weak people and the the people

159
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:48,079
that had no voice.

160
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,199
Now, you said that the assassination of

161
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:53,918
Harvey Milka really changed uh the

162
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,759
course. Well, before I was to leave

163
00:06:53,918 --> 00:06:59,279
jail,

164
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:02,639
Harvey and George would be dead.

165
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:05,000
killed by an ex-marine, an ex- cop, an

166
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:09,199
ex- fireman, an ex-s

167
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:12,598
supervisor who went on a Twinkie eating

168
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:16,080
Coca-Cola laced

169
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:19,120
rampage and politically assassinated

170
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:21,598
Harvey Milk and George Muscone.

171
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,240
The bullet that ripped through Harvey

172
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:25,839
and George's

173
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:29,519
brain set the gay movement back at least

174
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:31,198
10 years. And everyone knew that, but

175
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:34,000
not everyone knew that it also set the

176
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:36,080
marijuana movement back 10 years.

177
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,199
That we had this victory and the pe the

178
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:38,519
two people that were going to see it

179
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,800
enforced were now

180
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:42,318
dead. And the guy that did it is

181
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,560
claiming he ate so many Twinkies. That's

182
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:47,319
why he did it. So needless to say,

183
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:51,199
Proposition P W got put on the back

184
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:54,759
burner and u kind of forgotten including

185
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:58,160
by myself because like Harvey was my

186
00:07:54,759 --> 00:08:00,240
friend and I I couldn't even think about

187
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:03,039
Prop W. All I could think about is

188
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,918
revenge, revenge, revenge. Harvey is

189
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:08,240
dead. George is dead. We've got to get

190
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:10,198
we've got to try to get back our power.

191
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:13,160
I know we can never get those two men

192
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:17,199
back. So I ran for Harvey

193
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:18,280
seat. I fortunately lost in retrospect

194
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:22,360
as

195
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:25,399
fortunate but uh Proposition W was quite

196
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:28,000
forgotten not by me but by the

197
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:30,239
politicians and by the police and by the

198
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,360
district attorney. But then over the

199
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,918
years you've made it a point to bring a

200
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,240
lot of uh awareness to people about the

201
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:40,399
hemp movement. Well, you know,

202
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,080
marijuana, we've always had the all the

203
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,679
issues on our side. We've always had the

204
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:47,120
truth on our side, but I've really found

205
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:49,599
out 22 years truth is not enough and

206
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,519
that um in many ways people are

207
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,399
brainwashed.

208
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:57,839
And so I know that we can't rely on

209
00:08:54,399 --> 00:09:00,399
people's brain anymore in America. And

210
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,839
that in a way we have to rely on the

211
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,759
only thing that seems to be left and

212
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,839
that's their

213
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:07,439
heart and their conscience.

214
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:10,000
And right now, San Francisco is going

215
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,920
through a very serious AIDS crisis as

216
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,039
America

217
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:16,479
is. And uh we have a lot of sick

218
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:18,278
people. We have a lot of dying and we

219
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:22,320
have a lot of

220
00:09:18,278 --> 00:09:24,639
pain. And out of that pain arose

221
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,320
Proposition P, the medical marijuana

222
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:28,639
initiative that I just put on the ballot

223
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,399
this year. And I understand that the

224
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:32,240
success of that has really rocked the

225
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:35,600
nation. And we'll be talking about that

226
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,959
just as soon as we come back.

227
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,278
Welcome back. We're talking with

228
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:41,838
activist and political leader Dennis

229
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:43,679
Peron. Now, Dennis, you commented that

230
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:45,360
this particular proposition rose up out

231
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:48,559
of the AIDS community and the pain and

232
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,639
the suffering that you saw uh for uh the

233
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:52,319
relegalization for medical uses is what

234
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:54,639
this is all about, isn't it? It's true.

235
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:57,399
It's what it's about. Well, let me tell

236
00:09:54,639 --> 00:10:01,080
you something about how it became into

237
00:09:57,399 --> 00:10:04,240
being. It was January 27th,

238
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:06,320
1990 that we were sitting home. It was

239
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:09,080
about midnight and we were just ready to

240
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:11,839
go to bed when I hear a knock at the

241
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:14,720
door and I'm going down to Anzor. Before

242
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:17,760
I get down there, a sledgehammer breaks

243
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:20,680
the door down. And in come these five

244
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:22,799
people who claim they have a search

245
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:24,559
warrant. My immediate reaction that

246
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:25,958
these guys are rips because number one,

247
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:29,479
I'm not even

248
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:32,319
dealing. But they're not rips. They're

249
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:34,000
cops. They claim that they heard

250
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,839
somebody. Somebody said that I had

251
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:40,200
marijuana for sale. On that

252
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:42,640
basis, they got a

253
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:44,959
warrant. They found marijuana in my

254
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:47,000
house. They found 4 ounces of marijuana

255
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:51,039
in my house. But what they also found

256
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:54,039
was my very sick best friend dying of

257
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:54,039
AIDS.

258
00:10:54,639 --> 00:11:00,799
And their behavior that

259
00:10:57,799 --> 00:11:04,199
night reminded me of what the Jews had

260
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:07,599
to go through during the uh Nazi

261
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:11,519
era. My very sick friend was thrown on

262
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,519
the ground with a gun to his

263
00:11:11,559 --> 00:11:18,159
head. The son I

264
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:21,200
raised was intimidated and brutalized,

265
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:25,319
thrown on the ground. That night we

266
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:28,360
heard gay AIDS jokes, gay

267
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:30,920
jokes. We were physically and brutally

268
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:33,759
intimidated by these

269
00:11:30,919 --> 00:11:37,838
thugs who found 4 ounces of marijuana in

270
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:39,559
my house. Okay. They arrested me for the

271
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:42,079
4

272
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:43,919
ounces and nine months later I was

273
00:11:42,078 --> 00:11:47,278
exonerated because the 4 ounces of

274
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:50,519
marijuana were claimed by my very sick

275
00:11:47,278 --> 00:11:53,838
and dying friend Jonathan West.

276
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:56,200
Before he died, he testified that the 4

277
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:59,959
ounces of marijuana in the house were

278
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:03,920
his and the charges were dropped against

279
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:03,919
me. Two weeks later, he

280
00:12:04,278 --> 00:12:08,720
died. Was he using these for this

281
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:12,159
marijuana, the hemp for medical

282
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:15,519
purposes? Yeah. Cuz now we've heard on

283
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:18,159
this show and from other sources that it

284
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:19,679
can be helpful in relieving pain. It can

285
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:21,679
be helpful in taking care of nausea,

286
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:24,559
helping with the easy pain, the nausea,

287
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:27,120
increasing appetite, etc. Primarily why

288
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:29,439
I did it because marijuana was keeping

289
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,879
Jonathan alive for the last 3 years of

290
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:37,079
his life. He had no

291
00:12:31,879 --> 00:12:39,320
appetite. He had everything. He had

292
00:12:37,078 --> 00:12:43,199
cancer. He had

293
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:44,800
pneumonia. He was 90 lb.

294
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,680
Marijuana was literally keeping him

295
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:50,240
alive. It was offsetting all the side

296
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:52,159
effects of the ACT and the chemotherapy

297
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:55,560
and all the myriad of drugs he was

298
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:59,519
taking, legal drugs that had severe side

299
00:12:55,559 --> 00:13:02,638
effects from depression to vomiting to

300
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:05,919
diarrhea. So then you took this and you

301
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:09,759
went out and put together proposition in

302
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:10,838
memory of Jonathan West his eulogy. I

303
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:14,319
collected

304
00:13:10,839 --> 00:13:16,959
16,500 signatures to put marijuana as

305
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:19,600
medicine on the ballot in San Francisco.

306
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:22,479
I never dreamed in my wildest dreams

307
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:24,879
that we would get 80% of the vote, but

308
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:27,039
in fact, that's exactly what happened.

309
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:29,679
Now, what does the wording pretty much

310
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:31,360
specify on? Is it strictly for medical

311
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:33,359
purposes? Is that how it's worded? Is

312
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,519
there Yes, it's strictly for medical

313
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,519
purposes. It's only for people that have

314
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,799
certain

315
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:40,399
ailments that are covered under the

316
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:41,919
initiative. Now, does this mean that

317
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:43,600
their doctors can prescribe it or that

318
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:46,479
if they're just caught with it and they

319
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,800
have uh proof of a certain ailment, then

320
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:52,240
there's no prosecution? Well, legally,

321
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:54,240
uh, Proposition P has no stature. It is

322
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,639
merely an advisory to the city and

323
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,399
county of San Francisco.

324
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:01,320
However, I think the district attorney

325
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:03,600
can read numbers and I think that he

326
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:05,600
knows that the people of San Francisco

327
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,600
are serious. As a matter of fact, we got

328
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,920
more votes than the district attorney.

329
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,759
Okay. We're the highest vote getter in

330
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:13,679
San Francisco history. Now, how many

331
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:16,078
districts are there in San Francisco?

332
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:17,759
There are 628 precincts in San

333
00:14:16,078 --> 00:14:20,159
Francisco. There are 11 different

334
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:22,319
districts. Okay. Now, you brought in and

335
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:25,399
what 30 of those 30 of those precincts.

336
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:28,800
In the gay districts, we had 30

337
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:32,720
precincts. There was 100% for

338
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:35,039
Proposition P, not one dissenting vote.

339
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:37,120
And Proposition P seem to have crossed

340
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:39,360
all the boundaries. I know that everyone

341
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:42,560
thinks San Francisco is cook city. And

342
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:44,360
in many ways, it is Cook City. 40% of

343
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:49,439
the people are totally

344
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:51,919
kooky, but 80% aren't. And I think that

345
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:55,279
is a telling thing here that we have

346
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:58,639
crossed the Coo boundaries. We've gone

347
00:14:55,278 --> 00:15:00,559
beyond cooked and we even got the

348
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:02,000
elderly people to vote for this. And a

349
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:04,078
matter of fact, I had elderly people

350
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,480
calling me up to me and saying, "Dennis,

351
00:15:04,078 --> 00:15:09,278
you know, I used to use this stuff when

352
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:12,240
I was a kid. My mother used to give me

353
00:15:09,278 --> 00:15:14,159
this for, etc., etc., etc. She used it

354
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,720
for rheumatism. She used it for a

355
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:19,559
bronchitis. And they actually had a

356
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:23,040
tincture they put on

357
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:25,919
people's knees and joints for arthritis

358
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:27,360
and rheumatism. And so we even got the

359
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:29,679
old people. And I know that people

360
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:33,079
think, well, older people are very much

361
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:36,719
against us. Wrong. Older people are

362
00:15:33,078 --> 00:15:38,319
against drug use per se and drug abuse.

363
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:41,759
But quite frankly, I'm against drug

364
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:43,920
abuse myself. And so we are talking in

365
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:45,759
medicine. We know we haven't changed the

366
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:47,159
law. However, we have given the people

367
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:50,078
of San

368
00:15:47,159 --> 00:15:52,078
Francisco a defense in court. Okay. You

369
00:15:50,078 --> 00:15:53,679
know, is this defense good for strictly

370
00:15:52,078 --> 00:15:55,599
residents of San Francisco or if

371
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:57,919
somebody's from New York visiting cuz

372
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,600
they know that they're not feeling very

373
00:15:57,919 --> 00:16:02,479
healthy and they are looking for an

374
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,320
avenue which they can relieve pain that

375
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:07,519
to show up in San Francisco as a tourist

376
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:09,278
to take care of this problem or well uh

377
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,959
it does seem to become that San

378
00:16:09,278 --> 00:16:14,159
Francisco is going to become the lords

379
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:16,239
of America because after the election I

380
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:18,799
had gotten phone calls from all over the

381
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:21,680
nation from the people from multiple

382
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:22,799
scerosis to cancer and this and that and

383
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:24,159
they're anxious to come to San

384
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:25,838
Francisco, but now because now they

385
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:27,439
think they can get treated. Now, are

386
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:30,160
they also going to be able to grow it

387
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:33,959
and raise it? Well, s like I said,

388
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:36,319
Proposition P has no legal stature.

389
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:38,838
However, there is a political aspect of

390
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:41,040
San uh P that makes it very

391
00:16:38,839 --> 00:16:42,759
interesting. It was during a mayor's

392
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:46,240
race that Proposition P was on the

393
00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:48,399
ballot. The top two vote getters are now

394
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,320
in a runoff.

395
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:52,440
One of them is Frank Jordan, an ex-

396
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,320
police chief who is trying to be a

397
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:57,680
liberal, and one of them is the

398
00:16:54,320 --> 00:17:00,600
incumbent mayor who is a liberal. They

399
00:16:57,679 --> 00:17:03,919
have both been in contact with me asking

400
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:06,000
me how they can help enforce Proposition

401
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:10,240
P. Excellent.

402
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,798
I am playing that card. I am playing

403
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:14,480
each against each

404
00:17:11,798 --> 00:17:16,480
other for the for the betterment of this

405
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:19,120
country. And do you think you're going

406
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:21,360
to be able to get this to spread out now

407
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:23,038
through not just the state, but do you

408
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:25,359
think this will start big popping up now

409
00:17:23,038 --> 00:17:28,640
and like new Well, my new demands are um

410
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:31,359
six plants. Six plants per par per AIDS

411
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:33,280
patient, per cancer patient, multiple

412
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:34,639
scessive, whatever you got, six plants.

413
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:37,599
You're allowed to grow your own six

414
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:40,000
plants. And what I'm really asking for

415
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:43,038
is de facto legalization of marijuana

416
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,038
for cult cultivation of marijuana for

417
00:17:43,038 --> 00:17:48,879
medical purposes.

418
00:17:45,038 --> 00:17:50,400
I can't ask I I am asking the city of

419
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,880
county of San Francisco to look the

420
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:55,440
other way. Okay. When they see six

421
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:59,280
plants growing in a window to just look

422
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:01,440
the other way. I I know I cannot change

423
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:03,359
state law out of San Francisco. Although

424
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,840
I do believe the state of California is

425
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:09,279
ready and we are taking this initiative

426
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:11,279
on the road. Our next uh targeted

427
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:13,359
location is Santa Cruz, California.

428
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:16,279
Okay. And after that I want to take it

429
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:18,399
to Humboldt and Menescino and to Los

430
00:18:16,279 --> 00:18:21,599
Angeles right into the belly of the

431
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,640
beast. Okay. Now if someone how do they

432
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:24,079
protect themselves? I mean if they're

433
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,759
growing six months they have to have a

434
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:28,159
statement from a doctor saying that they

435
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:30,640
are AIDS patient or that's exactly what

436
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:33,038
we're advising patients to do to get an

437
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:36,038
advisory note from their doctor. Okay.

438
00:18:33,038 --> 00:18:38,558
That says if marijuana were legal I

439
00:18:36,038 --> 00:18:40,240
would prescribe it. And that's all they

440
00:18:38,558 --> 00:18:42,160
because doctors cannot legally prescribe

441
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:45,759
it. Now,

442
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:48,640
uh I do believe that there will never be

443
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:49,879
another prosecution for marijuana in San

444
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,400
Francisco

445
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:54,799
again. I believe that because I am going

446
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:57,600
to stand in the way of anybody that

447
00:18:54,798 --> 00:19:01,720
tries to prosecute anybody for um

448
00:18:57,599 --> 00:19:04,319
marijuana in San Francisco. Proposition

449
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:07,279
W. It was at the right time, the right

450
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:10,159
place, but Harvey dying and George dying

451
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:12,558
screwed it all up. But I intend to bring

452
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:15,080
up Proposition W, the one I put on

453
00:19:12,558 --> 00:19:18,000
before along with Proposition

454
00:19:15,079 --> 00:19:21,279
P, to try to make San Francisco the

455
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:24,079
place we wanted it to be. Excellent. And

456
00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:25,759
uh I want to you know let you know I

457
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:28,399
I've been aware of your work in the

458
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:30,000
movement for a long time and you know

459
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,759
you've made quite an impact on many of

460
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,558
the activists coast to coast and are

461
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:36,720
looked upon as one of the most

462
00:19:34,558 --> 00:19:38,399
intellectual and hardworking leaders in

463
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:41,038
what we're doing. It's been an honor to

464
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,880
have you on our show. I like to have you

465
00:19:41,038 --> 00:19:44,319
back again. You've come with so much

466
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,919
knowledge and information. We have a lot

467
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:47,918
of stories. Anytime you want me back,

468
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:50,400
Casper, it's been pleasure. Thank you so

469
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:52,799
much. And I also like to have you

470
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:55,200
realize that anybody can get out there

471
00:19:52,798 --> 00:19:56,720
and join this fight. Anybody can make a

472
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,880
difference. The important thing is to

473
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,319
get up and do it. Until we have the

474
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,960
opportunity to get together the next

475
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:07,079
time, keep strong, keep happy, keep

476
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,079
wise. Thank you.
