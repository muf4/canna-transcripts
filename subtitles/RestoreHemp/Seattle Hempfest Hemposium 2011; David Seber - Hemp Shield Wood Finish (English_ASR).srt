1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,200
i've developed a product called hemp

2
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:05,919
shield

3
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:08,000
which i introduced last year here

4
00:00:05,919 --> 00:00:09,199
this is the world's first hemp oil

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,638
containing

6
00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:16,559
uh wood finish and deck sealer

7
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:19,198
it may be the best one ever ever created

8
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:21,839
it was introduced right here it's a year

9
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,840
old today

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:31,439
this is this is our new color line

11
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:33,439
which by the way uses the best tints

12
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,600
that that are available on the market

13
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:36,718
they're not like the normal ones they're

14
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,039
actually

15
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:42,320
processed on this microscopic level so

16
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:44,799
that the light rays the uv rays are

17
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,840
reflected off and you can see through to

18
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:47,439
the

19
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,680
wood and to the color

20
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:52,959
and yeah and they use it on

21
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:55,600
fancy cars and places like that

22
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,719
so in every way this is a revolutionary

23
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,520
product

24
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:01,280
it turns out that it that is better it

25
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,920
has more durability

26
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:06,000
and a better uv resistance than anything

27
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,760
else out there on the market and it

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,478
beats most of the

29
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:13,760
current uh sealers for decks by

30
00:01:10,478 --> 00:01:16,799
magnitudes not 5 or 10

31
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:20,478
but but hundreds of percent

32
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:23,520
and as adam educated me last year the

33
00:01:20,478 --> 00:01:27,359
reason why it does this is because of

34
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:30,079
the hemp oil the hemp oil molecule is

35
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:32,478
the smallest of all the kinds of oils

36
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:35,200
that are used in coatings so it

37
00:01:32,478 --> 00:01:37,438
penetrates into the wood and it also

38
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,320
makes all those other oils

39
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:42,239
work

40
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:44,639
better together so we now have

41
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:47,519
probably the best deck sealer ever made

42
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,920
it's totally environmentally green no

43
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:53,118
vocs in our clear

44
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,519
it has no fumes whatsoever

45
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:58,078
so the truth of it is that because we

46
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:59,920
have called it a wood finish and a deck

47
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:03,039
sealer doesn't mean there aren't a bunch

48
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:05,200
of other uses for it i'm having my first

49
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:08,560
furniture manufacturer

50
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:10,560
come online in in the next coming weeks

51
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,080
we think there's a tremendous marine

52
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,560
application

53
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,560
for hemp shield
