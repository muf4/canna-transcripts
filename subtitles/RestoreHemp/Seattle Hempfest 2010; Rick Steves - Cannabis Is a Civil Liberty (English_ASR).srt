1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,879
when you bring in the economic needs uh

2
00:00:02,678 --> 00:00:06,759
of e of an economic crisis I mean

3
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:08,599
consider alcohol would have not have

4
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:10,000
been uh the prohibition against alcohol

5
00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:11,798
would not have been stopped had there

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,199
not been the Great Depression because

7
00:00:11,798 --> 00:00:15,359
they realized it was a stupid waste of

8
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:16,399
money I mean it's unfortunate from my

9
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:18,480
point of view because I'm just really

10
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:20,198
into the civil liberties aspect of it

11
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,240
that it would be an economic crisis that

12
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:24,640
legalizes marijuana but I guess I'll

13
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:26,640
take it any way we can all right now

14
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,000
what I want to talk about today is just

15
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,640
uh let's just look at my my notes here

16
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,159
it's not very uh

17
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,920
uh it's it's not very uh cohesive or or

18
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:37,799
U sort of like a pep rally thing I've

19
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,200
got a very cohesive little pep rally

20
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:41,199
talk I'll give them the main stage later

21
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,719
today but people who are sitting here

22
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,280
out of 100,000 people are interest who

23
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:46,600
are kind of interested in how do we

24
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,000
bring this to the public and I just want

25
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:50,960
to share with you my experience lately

26
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,159
I've got uh a lot of different angles on

27
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,679
this that are kind of unique first of

28
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:56,279
all I've spent a third of my adult life

29
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:57,840
hanging out with Europeans who think a

30
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,320
joint's about as exciting as a can of

31
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,280
beer it's just not a big deal over there

32
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:02,480
they look at us I just kind of think W

33
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,320
didn't you guys get over reap for

34
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:07,319
madness like like before the war but no

35
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:09,478
it's still alive and well in our society

36
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:12,239
I've also had uh 10 years now of being

37
00:01:09,478 --> 00:01:14,319
outspoken as a you know respectable part

38
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:16,959
of the business Community as a church

39
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:19,158
leader as a as somebody that that that

40
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:21,959
has some sort of a celebrity that you

41
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:23,920
got to take care of and uh against all

42
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:26,280
conventional wisdom I've been honest

43
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,519
about my beliefs in this I've come out

44
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,159
you know I mean remember when gay people

45
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:31,200
were coming out a couple decades ago and

46
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:33,079
how courageous that was well there's I

47
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,478
mean there's a there's 50 people that

48
00:01:33,078 --> 00:01:37,758
love pot for anyone that's here being

49
00:01:35,478 --> 00:01:40,799
honest about it that in itself is is

50
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:40,799
kind of pathetic in our

51
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
society you

52
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,600
know I'll be honest with you when I

53
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,759
first came to Hemp Fest the people here

54
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:53,438
scared me you know it's a freaky world I

55
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,759
mean look at these guys and then I saw

56
00:01:53,438 --> 00:01:57,639
it differently I mean Vivian helped me

57
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,280
Vivian explained this is the one time of

58
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,399
year when we can take this part I'm

59
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,920
recording you know and that's a

60
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:06,079
beautiful thing and uh it gave me great

61
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:08,000
respect for Freedom the irony is we're

62
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:09,959
more into freedom and the Constitution

63
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,318
and what America is all about than all

64
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:14,039
these people that think we're problems

65
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:17,839
and we've got to go over there and not

66
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:20,679
scare them that's our challenge well we

67
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:23,239
don't that's that's so clear to me

68
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:25,959
that's why I decided to wear my dorky

69
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:30,360
jacket today you know I want to put a

70
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:31,840
non-scary face on this drug policy issue

71
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,920
and this panel that was just up here was

72
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,400
saying some very wise ideas about how do

73
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:37,958
we frame this issue when We Don't Preach

74
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,039
to the choir but when we preach to

75
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:41,759
people out there who need to hear this

76
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:43,560
I've also had some interesting time

77
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:45,518
lately just getting to know police and

78
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,239
people in law enforcement and respecting

79
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,200
their opinion on this and I want to uh

80
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:50,719
share that too so I'm going to just kind

81
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:53,158
of weave some ideas together for the

82
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:57,919
next half hour here about that um first

83
00:02:53,158 --> 00:02:59,399
of all uh um Mr Kowski had one of his

84
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:01,518
guys kind of tracking me and listening

85
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,680
to all my talks and so on and and

86
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:03,840
because they were worried about what we

87
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,480
what we were thinking and then

88
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,000
apparently it was threatening them and

89
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:08,840
then you got warm Stamper actually

90
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,039
talking some common sense and so what's

91
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:13,360
going on and I got to know this man he's

92
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:15,120
a wonderful man very caring man and he's

93
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,720
diametrically opposed to us he just

94
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,640
thinks marijuana is the root of all

95
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:21,959
equal evil why is he involved he cares

96
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:24,079
why am I involved I care we both care

97
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:27,519
let's understand what makes each other

98
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:30,239
tick um and uh you know after a little

99
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:33,200
while we had dinner and he asked me why

100
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,920
are you into this why are you you're a

101
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:36,560
well-off white guy in the sub you could

102
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:38,318
smoke pod for the rest of your life and

103
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,959
you could email all your friends they

104
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:42,438
come on over we're smoking pot and

105
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:44,039
you're never going to get in any trouble

106
00:03:42,438 --> 00:03:46,158
and I thought about it you know you're

107
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:48,079
right I I why am I in this because I am

108
00:03:46,158 --> 00:03:50,759
in it just like you are what what is

109
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:53,400
motivating me it's not my own well-being

110
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:55,639
I'm just tired of lies in our society

111
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,360
and this is one of a million Crusades

112
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:59,399
you could speak out on and this is one

113
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,840
Crusade that decent people are afraid to

114
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,560
speak

115
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:05,319
people say it's courageous marijana all

116
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:07,598
right people say it's courageous to

117
00:04:05,318 --> 00:04:09,280
speak out about marijuana and just the

118
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:11,119
fact that it's courageous to speak out

119
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,400
on marijuana if you care about Freedom

120
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,759
there's reason to speak out on marijuana

121
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,720
I've never said smoke pot I've said it's

122
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:20,519
the civil liberty to smoke pot if you

123
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:23,280
choose to smoke pot I believe very

124
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:26,160
strongly that it is the the the

125
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:28,319
responsible adult recreational no

126
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:31,720
apologies necessary it just makes my

127
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:31,719
music more fun

128
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:39,038
recreational use of marijuana is a civil

129
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:40,759
liberty and I had this long dinner with

130
00:04:39,038 --> 00:04:43,199
this police officer who was the leading

131
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:45,600
narcotics kind of guy in Seattle and he

132
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:47,400
refuted everything I said except for one

133
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,759
thing he said I can't argue with your

134
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:52,079
civil liberties idea it's perfectly

135
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:54,439
Common Sense perfectly common sense it's

136
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:57,079
the civil liberties thing that really I

137
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:59,319
think can resonate as a matter of

138
00:04:57,079 --> 00:05:02,758
principle if you care about Freedom it

139
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:05,240
is a civil liberty to enjoy getting high

140
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:06,639
I would never say you should get high as

141
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,720
a matter of fact I think it's really

142
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,160
important to be honest about the

143
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,680
downside of pot I'm speaking out I get

144
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:15,400
these rich women's groups hiring me

145
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:18,800
hiring me to go to Deep South and talk

146
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:20,918
about travel and I talk about

147
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,800
marijuana you know I mean they're not

148
00:05:20,918 --> 00:05:24,399
inclined to hire a guy to come and talk

149
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,120
about drug policy but I talk to him

150
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:30,239
about Europe and I bring that into it

151
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:32,280
and what I really like to do is have

152
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,280
credibility by shooting off all the

153
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:36,839
Torpedoes am I saying you should smoke

154
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:39,159
pot no am I saying kids should smoke pot

155
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:41,839
no of course not am I saying it's okay

156
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:43,919
to drive while you're intoxicated no you

157
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:46,638
should throw the book at them am I

158
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:49,359
saying healthy no it's not healthy it

159
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:51,519
can be addictive it can mess you up but

160
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,319
that doesn't mean it should be criminal

161
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:55,120
you can take the crime out of it and you

162
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:58,479
can deal with it as Europeans deal with

163
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:00,800
it in the form of pragmatic harm

164
00:05:58,478 --> 00:06:02,399
reduction now now for 8 years when Bush

165
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,720
was president as soon as you had any

166
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:05,239
kind of a proposal that had the word

167
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,479
harm reduction in it it was not even

168
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:09,519
read it was just thrown away because

169
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:11,439
harm reduction is code for legalization

170
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:13,198
now we can talk about harm reduction

171
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:15,279
there's a pragmatism that turns me on

172
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:17,680
about European drug policy they've got

173
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:19,879
the same kind of challenges that we do

174
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,120
you know but they they do it differently

175
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:24,159
they do it with the pragmatism so our

176
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:26,478
challenge is to get out there and not be

177
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:29,039
scary find yourself in a circle where

178
00:06:26,478 --> 00:06:30,680
people go wow I never dreamed you would

179
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:33,079
be talking about marijuana in this

180
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:35,519
Progressive way and then get their

181
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:37,758
attentions ban and talk to them I've

182
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:39,279
done it on TV I've done it on radio I've

183
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,439
done it in churches I've done it in

184
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:44,198
conservative groups I've done it with

185
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:46,839
rotary clubs and afterwards people are

186
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:49,199
thankful for you bringing a little bit

187
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:50,638
of logic and Common Sense they don't

188
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,160
need to agree with you but all of a

189
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,038
sudden they understand this is not just

190
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,639
a bunch of heads wanting everybody to

191
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:56,680
turn in and tune out and drop out or

192
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:58,639
something like that cuz that's what

193
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:00,280
they're thinking there's a thoughtful

194
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,038
reason to be waiting The Crusade that

195
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:04,878
we're

196
00:07:02,038 --> 00:07:07,318
waging so I said I'm I've spent a lot of

197
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:08,919
time in Europe and uh it's fun to be in

198
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:10,800
Europe and one cool thing about being in

199
00:07:08,918 --> 00:07:13,079
Europe is you see your country from a

200
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,478
distance and you when you step away from

201
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:17,240
your country you see the quirky things

202
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:19,360
about your Society good and bad in high

203
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:22,280
Contex and all of a sudden you realize

204
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:24,319
more who you are and where you live um I

205
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:26,478
talked to this this uh this man who

206
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,439
spent 30 years of his life working in

207
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:29,519
New York like a lot of Greeks do it is

208
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:31,279
retired goes back to his home country

209
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:33,598
country he gets back home and it occurs

210
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:34,839
to him he never took a nap for the whole

211
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:36,839
time he's in the United States it just

212
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:39,839
wasn't okay and then he goes back to

213
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:41,918
Greece and it's okay to relax take a nap

214
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:44,000
I spent so many years taking my tour

215
00:07:41,918 --> 00:07:46,318
groups to Germany and trying to get them

216
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,038
to just take off their clothes and relax

217
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:51,919
in the spa and Americans just can't do

218
00:07:49,038 --> 00:07:55,360
it anybody else can we are so uptight

219
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:57,959
about so many silly things my TV show

220
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,080
actually airs only after 10:00 in some

221
00:07:57,959 --> 00:08:03,120
markets in this country because we have

222
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:05,719
500y old marble penises and 300y old

223
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:08,199
canvas breasts that we're sh the

224
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:10,599
children this is

225
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:12,038
America you go to I was just in

226
00:08:10,598 --> 00:08:14,598
Frankfurt and they have a place called

227
00:08:12,038 --> 00:08:15,918
Cafe fix right in the main street and

228
00:08:14,598 --> 00:08:18,478
it's where all the chunkys go to get

229
00:08:15,918 --> 00:08:21,799
their their heroin maintenance Clinic

230
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:23,478
advice and counseling and uh and and and

231
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:25,520
deal with their habit that's a very

232
00:08:23,478 --> 00:08:28,318
Progressive in your face ugly kind of

233
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:30,000
thing they prescribe cocaine in Britain

234
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,919
well they they have a Progressive

235
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,200
approach to hard drug problems in Europe

236
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:37,120
that would put to shame our our policies

237
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,039
and uh this is one thing that I like to

238
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,038
try to introduced to Americans as a

239
00:08:39,038 --> 00:08:42,679
travel writer as a travel writer I feel

240
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:44,519
like my job is kind of like the medieval

241
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:46,039
jester you know in the Middle Ages the

242
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:47,159
jester he would go out there and go

243
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:49,360
around with the people in the in the

244
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:50,719
gutters he'd come back into the castle

245
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,320
and he could tell the king the truth and

246
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,080
the King wouldn't tell him because the

247
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,480
king needed to know the truth the the

248
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,879
king actually paid the Jester's room and

249
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,920
board to be anointed by the jester for

250
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:02,200
him to come in and tell them the root

251
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:04,399
jokes everybody was talking about the

252
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:06,079
king out there outside of the castle

253
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,000
well we need to be gestures we need to

254
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:08,039
go out there and find out what the rest

255
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,159
of the world's do and come home and

256
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:10,599
that's a beautiful thing about travel

257
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:12,759
and that's one thing I try to do in my

258
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:14,000
travel writing there's a lot of fear in

259
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:15,879
our society right now have you noticed

260
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,720
it fear is being used against us there's

261
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:21,120
fear about marijuana there's fear about

262
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,920
terrorism there's fear about everything

263
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,440
I mean that was just uh one thing I

264
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:25,639
liked in my travels as go places where

265
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:27,680
you're supposed to be afraid and just

266
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:29,879
see if there's anything to that fear I

267
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:32,239
was just in Iran I was afraid to go to

268
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:33,360
Iran I almost left my big camera in

269
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,560
Athens because I thought they'd be

270
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,000
throwing stones at us as soon as they

271
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:38,518
saw an American Film on the streets of

272
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,759
Teran I got there and all of a sudden I

273
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:42,039
realized I've never enjoyed such a warm

274
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:44,559
welcome on the streets of any city in

275
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:46,360
the world as when I was in Iran I was in

276
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:47,838
a traffic jam stuck in a traffic g with

277
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:49,800
my driver it's a big city 10 million

278
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:51,440
people I think in teron we're going

279
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:54,479
nowhere suddenly my driver just bursts

280
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,480
out death to

281
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,320
traffic and I thought wait a minute I

282
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,040
thought it was death to Israel or death

283
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:03,640
to America says no right now death to

284
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:04,679
traffic you know and he said I said well

285
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:06,000
what's with that he said here in our

286
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:07,199
country whenever we're frustrated by

287
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,519
something that's just out of our control

288
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,399
we say death to that so all of a sudden

289
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:13,959
that little experience for me let me

290
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:15,240
have a more sophisticated and nuanced

291
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:17,119
understanding of what death to United

292
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:19,240
States means in a rally outside of our

293
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,799
Embassy now that's how travel can

294
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:23,360
overcome some fear there's also that

295
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:25,719
about all sorts of alternative

296
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,759
Lifestyles and when you travel you have

297
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:29,480
that joy and as a travel writer as I

298
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:30,600
mentioned I like to to bring that home

299
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,959
and I can give you lots of different

300
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:34,920
examples of that when I think about my

301
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:36,919
interest in marijuana it goes back also

302
00:10:34,919 --> 00:10:38,879
to how casual marijuana is in many

303
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:40,759
cultures I mean of course you go around

304
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:43,240
much of Europe and and marijuana is just

305
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:44,519
it's not a big deal I'm always talking

306
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,919
about it like it's a big deal because in

307
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:47,959
our country you can do hard hard time

308
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:49,399
for and the Europeans think that gets

309
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:51,399
get over it I mean most Dutch people

310
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:52,958
have never smelled marijuana they don't

311
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:54,879
care about marijuana it's just something

312
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:56,479
that's that some young people do as a

313
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:59,078
stage and a few people that they're

314
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,600
artistic kind of you know crazies and

315
00:10:59,078 --> 00:11:03,278
they enjoy marijuana all their life and

316
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,519
that's just fine it's not an issue the

317
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:05,879
very interesting thing when you travel

318
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:07,078
and you're interested in dir policy when

319
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:08,720
you go to Europe is you find there's a

320
00:11:07,078 --> 00:11:10,239
fundamental difference in Europe time

321
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,000
and time again my European friends tell

322
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,639
me a society has to make a choice

323
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,600
tolerate alternative Lifestyles or build

324
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:17,720
more

325
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,519
prisons they always they always are

326
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:22,639
interested in tolerance they're proud of

327
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:25,159
how few people they incarcerate in the

328
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:27,600
United States we incarcerate eight times

329
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:30,879
as many people per capita as Europeans

330
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:33,200
do eight times as many people when you

331
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:35,480
go to Europe you find that they have

332
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,879
drug problems they lost 8,000 people to

333
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:40,278
hero one overdoses last year we lost

334
00:11:37,879 --> 00:11:42,159
18,000 it's a serious problem in both

335
00:11:40,278 --> 00:11:43,958
societies how do they do it they've got

336
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:45,879
400 million people we got 300 million

337
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:48,000
people they've got Progressive laws

338
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:49,480
where they've got their Cafe fix on the

339
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,039
Main Street to give people their heroin

340
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:53,600
and and their counseling and so on we've

341
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:55,039
got locking people up how do they manage

342
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,320
to lose less than half the people that

343
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:59,919
we do and they've got more people and

344
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:02,879
easier laws pragmatism harm reduction

345
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:05,360
I was in Zurich a little while ago going

346
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:06,879
to a coffee just have a coffee I went

347
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,519
downstairs to the bathroom the lights

348
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:11,120
are blue what's going on with that open

349
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:14,039
the door complete blue lights then I

350
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:16,399
realized oh I can't see my veins

351
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:19,000
couldn't shoot up if I wanted to very

352
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:21,399
frustrating and

353
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,759
uh and I thought well that's interesting

354
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:24,399
so they don't they've got a public

355
00:12:22,759 --> 00:12:26,720
toilet basically and they would have all

356
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:28,278
their uh junkies down there shooting up

357
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,560
if they didn't have blue lights now the

358
00:12:28,278 --> 00:12:31,519
junkies can't find their so they won't

359
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:33,559
shoot up in their toilet across the

360
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:36,360
street I noticed a machine that used to

361
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:38,319
sell cigarettes and it's been repainted

362
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:40,800
and retooled and now it sells government

363
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:43,160
subsidized cenes I bought them they're

364
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:45,599
like one Frank each and they're just you

365
00:12:43,159 --> 00:12:47,078
know generic singes nobody shares

366
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,600
needles in Switzerland there's no

367
00:12:47,078 --> 00:12:50,439
discussion about it there's no

368
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,680
moralistic sort of political party in

369
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,800
Switzerland that says you shouldn't be

370
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:55,879
providing people needles it's just

371
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:58,120
common sense so you got your blue lights

372
00:12:55,879 --> 00:12:59,480
you got your uh heroin you got your

373
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,799
needles dispensed from m cigarette

374
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:02,480
machines and then down the street you

375
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:05,120
got your Cafe fix your heroin

376
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:07,278
maintenance clinic and then what happens

377
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,120
there is people go there for their fix

378
00:13:07,278 --> 00:13:10,799
they go there for Medical Counseling

379
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,480
they don't have this nervousness where

380
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:15,078
they have to top up and consequently

381
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,879
they consume less of that drug and they

382
00:13:15,078 --> 00:13:19,359
get themselves back on track they've got

383
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:21,439
a wonderful track record in Switzerland

384
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:24,039
for being more Progressive when it comes

385
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,680
to that problem Europe found that when

386
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:27,799
you take crime out of the equation and

387
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:30,439
you treat drug abuse as a health problem

388
00:13:27,799 --> 00:13:32,399
and an education challenge you have much

389
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:34,000
more positive results they find that if

390
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,759
you I just learned this from the website

391
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,278
at the European Union they figure for

392
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:40,120
every year or they put into education

393
00:13:37,278 --> 00:13:42,480
and counseling they save1 15 on police

394
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:44,839
and health costs so they their very

395
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,159
Wellness approach to this and one thing

396
00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:48,360
they've learned as I mentioned is you

397
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:50,360
cannot legislate morality nobody's going

398
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:52,480
to say smok and pot is good nobody's

399
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:55,120
going to say prostitution is good but

400
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:57,000
you can say it is feudal to make it

401
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:01,000
illegal it's going to happen it makes

402
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,958
more sense to legisl it make it safe and

403
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,879
give people some opportunity to learn

404
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:06,439
about the problem and get over it when

405
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:09,879
you look at the European Union website

406
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:11,800
there's no talk of marijuana as an evil

407
00:14:09,879 --> 00:14:13,399
thing there is when you search for

408
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:16,758
cannabis the only cannabis reference you

409
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:19,000
find is quote problem cannabis use

410
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:20,959
problem cannabis use some people use it

411
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,919
too much they get reliant on it and that

412
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:26,799
needs to be dealt with in Germany they

413
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:29,278
think that uh it's um boys smoke more

414
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:30,519
pot than girls in their teenage years

415
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:32,600
and they think it's because socially

416
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:34,320
boys are more nervous with girls and

417
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:36,600
they smoke a little uh marijuana in

418
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,759
order to be more comfortable socially so

419
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,000
they give them they actually have

420
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:41,440
counseling centers where they give them

421
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,759
flirting lessons so they can they can

422
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,360
flirt a little more confidently without

423
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:45,519
the help of the marijuana I don't know

424
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,919
if that's going to work or not but the

425
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:48,120
point is they're thinking out of the box

426
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:50,360
they're being pragmatic they're being

427
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:52,759
creative not making it a crime but

428
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:54,360
making it an education challenge here's

429
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:57,320
an example of pragmatism in Europe when

430
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:59,560
you travel in Scandinavia in June you

431
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:00,800
find drunk teenagers in flatbed trucks

432
00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:02,239
just making all sorts of noise going

433
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:03,879
through all the towns what's going on

434
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,639
it's graduation party time all the kids

435
00:15:03,879 --> 00:15:07,879
are getting drun who's paying for the

436
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:10,519
parties the parents are parents hire the

437
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:12,759
trunks hire the drivers and host the

438
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:15,000
kers parents don't want their kids to

439
00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:16,800
get drunk on graduation but parents in

440
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,919
Scandinavia are pragmatic enough to know

441
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:21,159
that kids will get drunk on high school

442
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:22,519
graduation no matter what you say and

443
00:15:21,159 --> 00:15:24,679
they would rather make sure they don't

444
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:26,360
drink and drive now that would be a real

445
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:28,719
tough sell in America we would rather

446
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:30,759
have The moralistic Stance don't drink

447
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,319
and then kids will drink and they will D

448
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:34,199
drive and drink and they will die as

449
00:15:32,318 --> 00:15:35,838
they do every year in our society that's

450
00:15:34,198 --> 00:15:38,599
the American approach to us a form of

451
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:40,920
drug abuse teenagers getting really drug

452
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:43,000
F graduation time and the European

453
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:46,198
approach is more honest it's more

454
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,639
credible and bottom line harm reduction

455
00:15:46,198 --> 00:15:50,399
fewer people

456
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:51,639
die the um blue lights thing I was

457
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:54,039
talking about that's another good

458
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:56,240
example of that and of course marijuana

459
00:15:54,039 --> 00:15:58,639
is considered a soft drug rather than a

460
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,519
hard drug it's hard when you talk about

461
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:02,360
drug policy in Europe to make a sweeping

462
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:05,879
statement because every country has its

463
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:07,240
own um policies and we always zero in on

464
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:08,278
the Netherlands and that's not fair

465
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:11,278
because there are some countries that

466
00:16:08,278 --> 00:16:12,879
have very regressive marijuana policies

467
00:16:11,278 --> 00:16:16,159
but more and more countries in Europe

468
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:18,318
are making marijuana quasi legal you

469
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:20,000
won't find it legal anywhere it's not

470
00:16:18,318 --> 00:16:22,360
absolutely legal anywhere except I think

471
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,480
in Portugal uh where consumption is

472
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:25,639
legal but sale is not and in my

473
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,278
experience that's because these

474
00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:29,480
countries are afraid to enter into a

475
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:31,159
trade war with the United States

476
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:33,199
the United States has huge power on

477
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:35,600
Canada and on Europe not to legalize

478
00:16:33,198 --> 00:16:36,799
marijuana and my friends in Denmark tell

479
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,120
me we got to be a little bit careful

480
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:40,078
with marijuana because every year we

481
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:41,759
have to arrest a couple of pot smokers

482
00:16:40,078 --> 00:16:44,519
in order to maintain favorite trade

483
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:48,600
status with the United States of America

484
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:48,600
that's our country that's our

485
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:55,000
country because of my research chores I

486
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:58,360
have to go to a lot of coffee shops in

487
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,958
Amsterdam you know and um I just love to

488
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:02,240
find these coffee shops andam and look

489
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:04,198
at them from a business and it's it's

490
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,798
it's just an amazing thing um they've

491
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:07,880
got The Loner bongs if you don't have

492
00:17:05,798 --> 00:17:09,119
your own they've got your email you can

493
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:10,839
check your email while you're there

494
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:13,438
there's no no miners they won't sell to

495
00:17:10,838 --> 00:17:15,318
people under 18 uh older clients don't

496
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:17,199
like the edgy vibe in a coffee shop so

497
00:17:15,318 --> 00:17:18,639
they just park their bicycle and get a

498
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:20,640
little marijuana to go and they'll go

499
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,400
back to their place and enjoy it uh the

500
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,400
police like the existence of coffee

501
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,240
shops in Amsterdam because they have a

502
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,600
bulletin board where they can post

503
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,000
information about what dangerous

504
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:31,079
chemical drugs are being sold on the

505
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,919
streets the police really see the coffee

506
00:17:31,079 --> 00:17:37,199
shops in Amsterdam as a firewall between

507
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:39,679
soft drug use and hard drug abuse and

508
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,600
it's very effective now we're so honed

509
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:44,038
in on that gateway drug nonsense that we

510
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:45,839
can't hardly imagine that but Europeans

511
00:17:44,038 --> 00:17:47,519
know that the only reason marijuana

512
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:50,359
could ever be a gateway drug is because

513
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:53,240
of its illegality it's the only thing

514
00:17:50,359 --> 00:17:55,319
Gateway about marijuana it's nonsense to

515
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:56,960
say he smoked marijuana and now he's a

516
00:17:55,319 --> 00:17:58,839
serial rapist well that doesn't mean

517
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,159
it's a gateway drug to something any

518
00:17:58,839 --> 00:18:03,439
more than he smoked marijuana and now

519
00:18:00,159 --> 00:18:06,400
he's looked on heroin but what is the

520
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:08,880
Gateway aspect of marijuana is that if

521
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,759
it is illegal people can only get it

522
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,159
from criminals selling it on the streets

523
00:18:10,759 --> 00:18:13,679
and those criminals have a vested

524
00:18:12,159 --> 00:18:15,679
interest in getting into something more

525
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:17,400
expensive more addictive and more

526
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:19,880
profitable than marijuana and that's

527
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:21,280
anything hard in the Netherlands they

528
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,720
don't have that as a matter of fact it's

529
00:18:21,279 --> 00:18:24,599
been 25 years in the Netherlands since

530
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:27,000
they arrested anybody for marijuana and

531
00:18:24,599 --> 00:18:30,000
during that time the hard drug using

532
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,440
population is getting older and not

533
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,079
getting bigger it's aging and and sort

534
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:37,159
of withering away whereas the soft drug

535
00:18:35,079 --> 00:18:39,319
enjoying population is about the same

536
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:41,919
maybe 10% more because of its quasi

537
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:43,439
legality but a very interesting aspect

538
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:44,880
of the whole discussion to me is in

539
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,798
America there's a lot of fear about

540
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,120
legalizing marijuana because a lot of

541
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:50,119
frightened people out in the sufferage

542
00:18:48,119 --> 00:18:52,558
think as soon as that's legal it's just

543
00:18:50,119 --> 00:18:54,439
going to be one Hempfest hell all of our

544
00:18:52,558 --> 00:18:56,359
world is going to be overwhelmed by

545
00:18:54,440 --> 00:19:00,880
people with weird t-shirts and funny

546
00:18:56,359 --> 00:19:02,678
hair and uh my feeling is that there's

547
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,320
not a reservoir of people out there

548
00:19:02,679 --> 00:19:05,960
wishing they could ruin their lives if

549
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:08,439
only it was legal you know in our

550
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:10,440
society anybody who wants to smoke pot

551
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:12,519
is smoking pot anybody wants to be a

552
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,840
freak is a freak it's just a free world

553
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:16,119
and you can live your life the way you

554
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:17,720
want to live it Europe's Europe's

555
00:19:16,119 --> 00:19:20,399
experience and they've got a 25e track

556
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:22,759
record on this between 10 and 25 years

557
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,840
depending on the country is use does not

558
00:19:22,759 --> 00:19:27,519
go up when you get more easygoing on

559
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:28,918
your laws as a matter of fact by every

560
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:30,480
count and it's frustrating to you use

561
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:31,600
statistics in Europe because everybody

562
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,200
or in this discussion because

563
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:35,199
everybody's got an agenda who makes

564
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,159
statistics you look at a conservative

565
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,400
statistics like our police do and you're

566
00:19:37,159 --> 00:19:40,840
going to see all sorts of stuff you want

567
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,280
to see you look at liberal statistics

568
00:19:40,839 --> 00:19:44,079
like anybody in our camp does you're

569
00:19:42,279 --> 00:19:46,000
going to see the statistics you want but

570
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:48,119
across the board the statistics in the

571
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,519
United States and in Europe show that

572
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:53,079
Americans consume double per capita the

573
00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:55,480
marijuana that Europeans do and the

574
00:19:53,079 --> 00:19:57,918
Dutch consume no more than the average

575
00:19:55,480 --> 00:20:01,279
in Europe the conclusion you can draw

576
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:04,000
from that quite quite um clearly is that

577
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:06,399
how hard the laws are do not impact how

578
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,400
many people enjoy marijuana

579
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,640
recreationally and that's a fundamental

580
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,600
it's a little bit beyond the attention

581
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:14,200
span of the average just say no bumper

582
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:16,000
sticker person is afraid of marijuana

583
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:17,960
but you got to sit people down and talk

584
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,480
to them a little bit and actually they

585
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:22,279
find this quite

586
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,839
interesting when you think about the

587
00:20:22,279 --> 00:20:25,440
situation in the Netherlands you know

588
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:27,599
the King County Bar Association is a

589
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,640
national leader in our country for uh

590
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:31,599
thinking about the reality of marijuana

591
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:33,360
and uh and the pragmatism of not

592
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:34,480
criminalizing it and they've also been

593
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:36,798
thinking about what happens after it's

594
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,000
legal I went to a 2 or 3 Day seminar

595
00:20:36,798 --> 00:20:39,319
Roger Goodman and a bunch of guys in

596
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,839
Seattle put on and people from all over

597
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:42,038
the country came there talking about

598
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:43,720
okay let's have the hypothetical

599
00:20:42,038 --> 00:20:45,440
situation that marijuana is legal now

600
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:46,679
how do we regulate it that's a very

601
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,640
tough thing the Europeans have been

602
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:49,519
struggling with this and they haven't

603
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:51,600
figured it out in the Netherlands you've

604
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:53,599
got that gray area you can sell it all

605
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:56,279
you want but just we don't want to know

606
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:58,279
how it's wholesaled and they they don't

607
00:20:56,279 --> 00:21:00,720
want big wholesalers they like little

608
00:20:58,279 --> 00:21:02,119
boat Boutique producers my friends who

609
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,759
run coffee shops in Amsterdam have told

610
00:21:02,119 --> 00:21:05,599
me they don't import marijuana much

611
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:07,359
anymore like they used to used to get

612
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:08,839
fancy strains from all over Asian

613
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:11,319
African so on now they've got the

614
00:21:08,839 --> 00:21:13,000
technology to grow it locally it's safer

615
00:21:11,319 --> 00:21:14,879
and easier for them to grow locally and

616
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,839
they get those strains that they wanted

617
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,760
they've got you know they got the

618
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:19,319
Cannabis Cup and that sort of thing well

619
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:21,558
that's what's with that well every

620
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:22,720
different uh Boutique grower like micro

621
00:21:21,558 --> 00:21:24,599
Brews or something is going to have

622
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,960
their own Forte and they have a contest

623
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:28,319
in see what ISM almost all that is

624
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:31,919
locally grown uh in the Netherlands they

625
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:33,839
have got to figure out how to regulate

626
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:35,840
the marijuana because it is essentially

627
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:37,038
legal for instance and this is something

628
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:38,558
that'll allay a lot of fears in the

629
00:21:37,038 --> 00:21:40,119
United States a lot of people who are

630
00:21:38,558 --> 00:21:42,000
afraid of marijuana legalization don't

631
00:21:40,119 --> 00:21:43,599
want Billboards advertising it I don't

632
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,558
think anybody would want marijuana

633
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:46,918
legalized and advertised anymore than

634
00:21:45,558 --> 00:21:48,359
we'd want hard liquor advertised

635
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:50,559
everywhere you look you know how we

636
00:21:48,359 --> 00:21:52,000
control that very easy to control that

637
00:21:50,558 --> 00:21:54,079
as a matter of fact in the Netherlands

638
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,679
you st to a coffee shop and I do this as

639
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:57,158
my uh in my research to try to think

640
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:59,440
okay I'm a little bit clueless and

641
00:21:57,159 --> 00:22:01,000
overwhelmed as a typical Serv be how how

642
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,960
how do I know what to buy I steep into a

643
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,200
coffee shop I don't see a menu where's

644
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:08,000
the menu and he says you've got to push

645
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,679
that button so I push the button and by

646
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,919
physically pushing the button it lights

647
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:14,120
the menu and I can read it but the point

648
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:16,480
is I have to take the initiative to get

649
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:17,678
the information it cannot come to me you

650
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,278
see what I mean that's just a little

651
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:20,960
legalistic find point but that's the

652
00:22:19,278 --> 00:22:22,519
fascinating way that they've dealt with

653
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,720
that in the Netherlands that's

654
00:22:22,519 --> 00:22:26,599
pragmatism that's really thinking how

655
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,159
can I accomplish something they're not

656
00:22:26,599 --> 00:22:29,639
going to advertise it to the outside

657
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:31,559
world they're not going to have a coffee

658
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,919
shop next to a school they're not going

659
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:35,240
to let miners have it they're going to

660
00:22:32,919 --> 00:22:36,880
limit it to a small amount all this kind

661
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:38,240
of thing it's fascinating to see how

662
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,240
they do that right now the mayor of

663
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:42,000
Amsterdam is proposing doubling the

664
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,720
legal inventory for coffee shops in

665
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,679
Amsterdam right now a coffee shop can

666
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:47,640
still sell literally a ton of pot over

667
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:50,400
the course of a year as long as he never

668
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:53,000
has more than half a kilo in stock

669
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,960
that's one pound and the problem with

670
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,679
that is of course you have all these

671
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:57,759
little you know we're out it's 2:00

672
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:59,679
we're out bring some more it's 10:00 in

673
00:22:57,759 --> 00:23:01,158
the morning we got to another delivery

674
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:04,759
and the the mayor just doesn't like the

675
00:23:01,159 --> 00:23:06,919
traffic congestion caused by all the pic

676
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:08,960
deliveries so the mayor of Anam right

677
00:23:06,919 --> 00:23:11,000
now it's a big discussion is promoting

678
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:14,240
doubling the allowable inventory limit

679
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:16,480
to 1 kilo 2.2 lb and that would cut in

680
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:18,759
half the traffic congestion caused by

681
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,919
little pot deliveries so uh that's an

682
00:23:18,759 --> 00:23:21,400
interesting issue another interesting

683
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:23,520
issue is of course Europe has gone smoke

684
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,960
free tobacco wise you can't smoke

685
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:26,240
tobacco indoors in most countries in

686
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,480
Europe you go to the great pubs of

687
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,038
Europe they used to be so Smoky and you

688
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:30,640
had to put up with it now they're

689
00:23:29,038 --> 00:23:32,038
completely smoke free it's quite nice

690
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,880
and everybody are sitting outside with

691
00:23:32,038 --> 00:23:35,200
blankets around them smoking smoking

692
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:37,000
their cigarettes cuz you can only smoke

693
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,558
outside if you're a coffee shop in

694
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,839
Amsterdam or anywhere in the Netherlands

695
00:23:38,558 --> 00:23:41,960
and you don't have a place to sit

696
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:43,918
outside your business is at a huge

697
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:47,640
disadvantage because it's illegal to

698
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:50,240
smoke uh tobacco indoors and Europeans

699
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:52,799
like to mix their marijuana with

700
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:55,200
tobacco so uh if you have a place

701
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:58,400
outside to sit it fits your clientele if

702
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,798
you don't you're in trouble curiously if

703
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,798
if you're a coffee shop in abston you

704
00:23:59,798 --> 00:24:02,798
can boot your license if you let people

705
00:24:01,798 --> 00:24:04,599
smoke

706
00:24:02,798 --> 00:24:07,319
tobacco but they can smoke all the

707
00:24:04,599 --> 00:24:08,959
marijuana they want I had this nice

708
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:11,798
dinner with a local policeman and I

709
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:13,240
learned a lot and we need to respect and

710
00:24:11,798 --> 00:24:14,759
I'm glad we do respect the law

711
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:16,159
enforcement in our city especially

712
00:24:14,759 --> 00:24:17,879
during hemp test and this sort of thing

713
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:20,240
I mean one thing about policemen is

714
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:21,960
they're not they didn't make these laws

715
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,400
they're hired to enforce the laws they

716
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:25,278
they don't even think about the logic of

717
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,840
Allah law they're trained not to think

718
00:24:25,278 --> 00:24:28,720
about the logic of the law but think

719
00:24:26,839 --> 00:24:30,240
about enforcing the laws and you got to

720
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,399
be thankful there are police enforcing

721
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:34,519
laws what we need to do is not be pissed

722
00:24:32,398 --> 00:24:36,199
off at the police but change the law if

723
00:24:34,519 --> 00:24:38,599
it's a stupid one that is good

724
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:40,798
citizenship to Advocate changing the law

725
00:24:38,599 --> 00:24:40,798
that's

726
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,679
not I mean it's not our good citizen if

727
00:24:44,839 --> 00:24:48,359
you recognize a law that's causing more

728
00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:50,919
harm than the problem it's trying to

729
00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:52,000
address to talk to people educate people

730
00:24:50,919 --> 00:24:55,038
and change it and that's what we're

731
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:57,960
doing here in a beautiful not very fast

732
00:24:55,038 --> 00:25:00,640
process but in a beautiful process um I

733
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:03,000
think that uh what I learned from uh

734
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:05,200
from my discussion with this police

735
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,880
officer is the driving mission for

736
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:10,000
police along with uh enforcing the laws

737
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:12,320
is protecting children and stopping

738
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,798
violence all right one beautiful thing

739
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:15,839
about us here at Hempfest is it's a

740
00:25:13,798 --> 00:25:17,960
mellow crowd it blows them away how

741
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:20,439
mellow we are and nobody is trying to

742
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:22,600
get kids high I as as these guys said in

743
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:24,360
the panel before let's make that very

744
00:25:22,599 --> 00:25:27,038
very clear every time we talk about

745
00:25:24,359 --> 00:25:28,719
legalizing marij is it's not for kids

746
00:25:27,038 --> 00:25:30,480
you can debate 18 or 20 and I think

747
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,399
there's a lot of wisdom in 18 just cuz

748
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,919
you don't want to force people to do

749
00:25:31,398 --> 00:25:35,439
illegal things you want to be pragmatic

750
00:25:32,919 --> 00:25:37,759
about it but laay that concern from the

751
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:39,600
start right off the back because the two

752
00:25:37,759 --> 00:25:41,319
the two things I always hear is you want

753
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:43,000
all the kids to get high and you want

754
00:25:41,319 --> 00:25:45,558
people driving when they're high think

755
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,159
of the children you should treat it as

756
00:25:45,558 --> 00:25:48,960
serious as Europe does you know how

757
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:51,080
Europe is much more strict on driving

758
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:53,558
wall inasia than we are and they're much

759
00:25:51,079 --> 00:25:55,359
more liberal about getting intoxicated

760
00:25:53,558 --> 00:25:57,240
so they're able to give people the civil

761
00:25:55,359 --> 00:25:59,558
liberty but maintain order and that's

762
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:01,440
something we can do also so again cops

763
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:04,319
don't care to evaluate the law they're

764
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:06,278
hired to enforce the law most policemen

765
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:07,918
just think if there's trouble it's

766
00:26:06,278 --> 00:26:10,200
because those people have been messing

767
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:11,960
around with drugs alcohol hard drugs

768
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:14,679
marijuana and they put it all in the

769
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:16,159
same ball all right so marijuana has the

770
00:26:14,679 --> 00:26:18,159
problem of being in there with the

771
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:20,278
alcohol and the hard drugs in the mind

772
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:22,080
of a police officer I'm not I'm not

773
00:26:20,278 --> 00:26:24,319
saying I understand this or agree with

774
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:25,798
this it's just that's the reality from

775
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:27,519
their perspective and I think it makes a

776
00:26:25,798 --> 00:26:29,398
little sense um they're a little

777
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:30,879
offended by the Mar the medical

778
00:26:29,398 --> 00:26:32,199
marijuana thing because they think a lot

779
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,360
of people just say they got chronic neck

780
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:36,278
Plaines and uh they go get their card

781
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:39,599
and they just are making a sham of the

782
00:26:36,278 --> 00:26:41,119
whole thing um I think um as I mentioned

783
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:42,359
when use the word harm reduction right

784
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:43,599
away they think you're just that's just

785
00:26:42,359 --> 00:26:45,678
a front for

786
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:48,439
legalization and

787
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:50,798
uh and the reality is they told me that

788
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:54,200
the reality is uh you know if you're if

789
00:26:50,798 --> 00:26:56,679
you're just using it uh responsibly and

790
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:58,798
in lowkey it's pretty safe my feeling is

791
00:26:56,679 --> 00:27:00,919
of course it's a racist law and it's a

792
00:26:58,798 --> 00:27:02,798
classes law if you're a rich white guy

793
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:03,799
you're pretty safe if you're not wealthy

794
00:27:02,798 --> 00:27:04,918
if you're not well educated if you're on

795
00:27:03,798 --> 00:27:07,038
the streets and if you're a person of

796
00:27:04,919 --> 00:27:09,000
color you got a real serious problem and

797
00:27:07,038 --> 00:27:11,440
that in itself is reason to take a hard

798
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,440
look at this

799
00:27:15,798 --> 00:27:19,879
law I do want to talk just for a minute

800
00:27:18,319 --> 00:27:21,558
about the parallels between Prohibition

801
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:23,480
in the 1920s and 30s and prohibition

802
00:27:21,558 --> 00:27:26,879
today against marijuana because there's

803
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:29,399
we can learn a lot from that and uh uh

804
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:31,520
remember there was a a lot of discussion

805
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:33,599
back in the 30s and when they finally

806
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:35,960
made alcohol legal nobody was saying

807
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:38,480
booze is good there was just a broad

808
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:40,480
recognition that the law is more costly

809
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:42,519
than the drug problem itself that's what

810
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:45,640
we're doing today we're saying that the

811
00:27:42,519 --> 00:27:49,399
law is more costly than the drug problem

812
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:51,080
itself I think um uh when we look at

813
00:27:49,398 --> 00:27:52,239
what's happening today historically

814
00:27:51,079 --> 00:27:53,639
we're going to see there's this perfect

815
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:56,200
storm that comes together just like that

816
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:57,559
which happened back in the 1930s and 70

817
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:00,720
years later nobody would argue that

818
00:27:57,558 --> 00:28:01,759
alcohol should be illegal again um I

819
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,600
think we need to worry about our

820
00:28:01,759 --> 00:28:05,038
credibility and I think I've talked

821
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:06,519
about credibility enough but it's that

822
00:28:05,038 --> 00:28:08,798
kids thing and that driving thing that

823
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:10,399
comes back and back again my experience

824
00:28:08,798 --> 00:28:13,359
a lot of people are curious well how can

825
00:28:10,398 --> 00:28:15,199
I talk about this uh in public and I get

826
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:17,359
introduced all over the place as that

827
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:20,960
marijuana guy or the board member of

828
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:22,719
normal or you know with the ACLU and a

829
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,159
lot of people cringe my staff cringes

830
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:26,120
cuz my staff is worried about you know

831
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:27,799
are we going to be in business next year

832
00:28:26,119 --> 00:28:29,239
um I've got when I get underwriting for

833
00:28:27,798 --> 00:28:30,599
my team TV show I've got you know

834
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:33,120
they're all wigged out about what are

835
00:28:30,599 --> 00:28:34,839
you going to say about marijuana uh and

836
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:36,359
uh when I get a gig to write for a big

837
00:28:34,839 --> 00:28:38,000
magazine they'll say well promise you

838
00:28:36,359 --> 00:28:40,199
won't tell everybody to go to Amsterdam

839
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,599
and get high uh you know people are

840
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:43,558
people are business people are really

841
00:28:41,599 --> 00:28:46,158
nervous about this I think the business

842
00:28:43,558 --> 00:28:48,558
Community is behind the politicians and

843
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:50,440
the politicians are behind the public

844
00:28:48,558 --> 00:28:52,319
and it's just an evolutionary thing

845
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:53,880
politicians are learning you Senator

846
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:55,678
Cole Wells right here all over the

847
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:57,399
country I've been talking to politicians

848
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:58,679
this is not so radical to them I mean

849
00:28:57,398 --> 00:29:00,798
they don't they're realizing it's no

850
00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:02,519
longer political suicide to talk smartly

851
00:29:00,798 --> 00:29:04,119
about this issue it's still they've got

852
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:05,359
a lot of fish to FY and this is just Why

853
00:29:04,119 --> 00:29:07,038
do I want to get involved in this one

854
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:08,519
you know but I think that we've made a

855
00:29:07,038 --> 00:29:09,919
lot of progress in that way but in my

856
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:11,679
experience it's the corporate world

857
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:14,399
that's so nervous about it and there's

858
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:16,840
no ethics in the corporate world I mean

859
00:29:14,398 --> 00:29:19,278
uh I mean think about um Mark you know

860
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:21,119
Mark Phelps right well when he got what

861
00:29:19,278 --> 00:29:23,079
was the deal he uh he was underwritten

862
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:27,719
or he was a spokesperson

863
00:29:23,079 --> 00:29:31,319
for uh kellock wasn't it and and and

864
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:33,038
stuff sandwiches yeah so Kellogg was got

865
00:29:31,319 --> 00:29:35,158
rid of him as a as a spokesperson

866
00:29:33,038 --> 00:29:38,319
because he's a he smokes marijuana and

867
00:29:35,159 --> 00:29:40,720
then Kellogg stock like plummets

868
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:42,119
70% Subway sandwiches was was going to

869
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:44,079
get rid of them also and they saw what

870
00:29:42,119 --> 00:29:46,119
happened to Kellogg's stock and they had

871
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:47,759
a meeting and they said you know this

872
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:49,479
would be costly for us to get rid of

873
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:51,720
Mark Phelps in fact maybe it's a plus to

874
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:56,038
have Mark Phelps when it comes to Subway

875
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:59,120
sandwiches and and and Google this check

876
00:29:56,038 --> 00:30:02,759
this out Subway actually after kellogs

877
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:05,918
dumped Mark Phelps Michael Phelps Subway

878
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:09,558
sandwiches started an ad campaign called

879
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:13,080
eat Subway sandwiches and feeli the

880
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:15,480
buzz it's serious check it out so but

881
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:17,639
what I dra from that is corporations

882
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:19,839
have no moral Stak in they're just

883
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:21,880
reading the bottom line and if they can

884
00:30:19,839 --> 00:30:23,359
realize that it's not bad for their

885
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:24,760
bottom line they care less if

886
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:26,000
everybody's high or not as long as

887
00:30:24,759 --> 00:30:29,960
they're spending their money in their

888
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,960
court right um

889
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:33,679
every time I'm on the media talking

890
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:36,000
about this it's amazing to me how

891
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:37,519
uptight people get and when it's done

892
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,880
the the mic's turned off they say thank

893
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:41,839
you for speaking out across the board

894
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:43,559
I've been on every station around here

895
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:44,839
you know and they're all nervous they

896
00:30:43,558 --> 00:30:46,720
can't believe I'm talking about it when

897
00:30:44,839 --> 00:30:49,119
it's off they go thank you you're

898
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:51,399
speaking about it they can't everybody's

899
00:30:49,119 --> 00:30:53,119
worried about their jobs it's a scary

900
00:30:51,398 --> 00:30:55,518
time economically and with this

901
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:58,119
prohibition and all the lies and and all

902
00:30:55,519 --> 00:31:00,880
the cowardice in our public it's scary

903
00:30:58,119 --> 00:31:01,879
for people when ACLU contacted me to do

904
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:03,200
that half hour video I don't know if

905
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:05,519
you've seen it but check it out and they

906
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:08,558
did a great job it's a wonderful

907
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:11,200
wonderful half hour historical

908
00:31:08,558 --> 00:31:13,200
informational documentary about the war

909
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:15,440
against marijuana I learned a lot in the

910
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,960
process making this show have any of you

911
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,960
seen the show of the ACL you did on

912
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:22,038
marijuana time per discussion it's on

913
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:23,120
YouTube yeah well everybody who cares

914
00:31:22,038 --> 00:31:24,879
about this should have a little

915
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:26,518
background on the whole situation and

916
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:28,639
check it out now we have three TV

917
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:30,359
stations in our state in our City three

918
00:31:28,638 --> 00:31:32,038
three local stations we were going to

919
00:31:30,359 --> 00:31:33,719
buy half an hour we're going to pay them

920
00:31:32,038 --> 00:31:35,638
just what you pay for a thigh Master's

921
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:37,639
ad you know and they wouldn't let us do

922
00:31:35,638 --> 00:31:40,119
it they would let you advertise thy

923
00:31:37,638 --> 00:31:41,719
Master but not talking about marijuana

924
00:31:40,119 --> 00:31:43,158
there's so much fear in the media about

925
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:44,960
this because they think you would offend

926
00:31:43,159 --> 00:31:47,159
and scare away your advertisers so this

927
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:48,480
is a challenge that we have to uh deal

928
00:31:47,159 --> 00:31:50,840
with and it's been a frustrating thing

929
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,440
for me in my own world I have to talk

930
00:31:50,839 --> 00:31:54,839
about this really upfront with all of my

931
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:56,759
TV stations all of my radio stations all

932
00:31:54,839 --> 00:31:58,839
of my newspaper syndications all of my

933
00:31:56,759 --> 00:32:00,440
Publishers and let know I am a

934
00:31:58,839 --> 00:32:02,720
spokesperson for the legalization of

935
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:05,159
marijuana I'm not in favor of smoking

936
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,240
marijuana I don't think it's for kids I

937
00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:08,559
don't think you should drive while

938
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:10,240
intoxicated I think the law is causing

939
00:32:08,558 --> 00:32:13,480
more problems than the drug problem

940
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:15,399
itself and I think bottom line the adult

941
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:18,200
responsible recreational use of

942
00:32:15,398 --> 00:32:20,678
marijuana is a civil liberty you see how

943
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,679
clear that

944
00:32:23,278 --> 00:32:29,079
was if you can get them to listen that

945
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:30,919
WR if you can get them to listen that

946
00:32:29,079 --> 00:32:33,720
long and if they got half a brain they

947
00:32:30,919 --> 00:32:35,360
see you're not evil all right but if you

948
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:37,079
can't get them to listen they just think

949
00:32:35,359 --> 00:32:39,558
you're going to be uh taking all their

950
00:32:37,079 --> 00:32:41,599
kids into some sort of a hemp is

951
00:32:39,558 --> 00:32:44,599
Nightmare all right

952
00:32:41,599 --> 00:32:46,558
so and once in a blue moon and in my in

953
00:32:44,599 --> 00:32:48,000
my travels you know some my my travel

954
00:32:46,558 --> 00:32:50,398
business somebody calls me up and they

955
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,720
say I just read what you think about

956
00:32:50,398 --> 00:32:54,839
marijuana and we're not going to go on

957
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:56,759
your tour we're canceling out we're

958
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:59,240
telling all our friends not to travel

959
00:32:56,759 --> 00:33:01,638
with Rick ste's Europe either and all I

960
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:04,440
can think is Europe will be much more

961
00:33:01,638 --> 00:33:04,439
fun without

962
00:33:06,278 --> 00:33:11,638
you

963
00:33:08,839 --> 00:33:15,038
now we have tough Economic Times in this

964
00:33:11,638 --> 00:33:16,319
country you know really tough and um I'm

965
00:33:15,038 --> 00:33:17,679
surprised there's not more people who

966
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:19,759
are Business Leaders who can't have a

967
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:22,080
little fun with honesty you know what I

968
00:33:19,759 --> 00:33:23,919
mean I know so many Business Leaders who

969
00:33:22,079 --> 00:33:26,079
agree with us but because of their

970
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:28,480
financial nervousness they cannot talk

971
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:31,480
about it there are

972
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:33,639
Community leaders PL leaders respected

973
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:36,360
people that understand we're not pro

974
00:33:33,638 --> 00:33:38,278
drugs we're pro freedom and civil

975
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:41,158
liberties and pragmatism when it comes

976
00:33:38,278 --> 00:33:42,839
to dealing with drug abuse problems I've

977
00:33:41,159 --> 00:33:45,679
made a point to talk with every one of

978
00:33:42,839 --> 00:33:49,000
our Congress people our Senators our

979
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:51,480
mayor our governor my pastor they know

980
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,599
what I think they respect me for it I've

981
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:55,880
got my little lines down you know I know

982
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:58,879
how to shoot off the Torpedoes I want

983
00:33:55,880 --> 00:34:01,039
them to know what I think we all need to

984
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:03,399
do that if we did that more effectively

985
00:34:01,038 --> 00:34:05,158
we would be a lot farther along and we'd

986
00:34:03,398 --> 00:34:07,119
be able to have a real celebration when

987
00:34:05,159 --> 00:34:10,079
we come to a gathering like this please

988
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:10,078
think of ways to do

989
00:34:13,398 --> 00:34:18,319
that okay I'm going to just uh wrap it

990
00:34:16,838 --> 00:34:19,679
up here I think I've done through all of

991
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:22,079
my notes pretty well I want to remind

992
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:23,559
you um there's advocacy groups out there

993
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:25,320
I mean I can't keep track of all the the

994
00:34:23,559 --> 00:34:26,719
won there's a lot of policy WS that I

995
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,720
mean just throw me away how they

996
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:29,158
understand all these issues and the

997
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:30,878
legislative initiatives and everything

998
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:32,200
but all of us who care about this issue

999
00:34:30,878 --> 00:34:34,000
and all of us that don't want to be

1000
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:35,199
criminals and all of us who have friends

1001
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,480
that can't even come here because

1002
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:38,480
they'll lose their jobs or they're

1003
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:41,639
worried about theirs they want to come

1004
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:44,358
here all of these people need to

1005
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:47,800
recognize that there are advocacy groups

1006
00:34:44,358 --> 00:34:50,199
waging a hard and serious battle for us

1007
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:52,599
as experts they're putting up lucrative

1008
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:55,039
careers to be working in this civil

1009
00:34:52,599 --> 00:34:56,639
liberty struggle and you can it's a fun

1010
00:34:55,039 --> 00:34:58,000
thing as a citizen to shop around and

1011
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:59,599
choose which one turn John everybody's

1012
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,960
got a different take on it I love the

1013
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:03,240
work of normal I've been a board member

1014
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,800
of normal for nearly 10 years now and I

1015
00:35:03,239 --> 00:35:07,639
don't look at these groups like normal

1016
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:09,720
as Charities they are services and

1017
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:11,400
they're fighting a battle for me and if

1018
00:35:09,719 --> 00:35:16,118
you're not a paying member of some

1019
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:16,119
advocacy group you're frankly not on

1020
00:35:20,358 --> 00:35:25,598
board it's 20 bucks it's 20 bucks you

1021
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:27,000
can put on a funny t-shirt and come down

1022
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:28,480
here once a year and we're never going

1023
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,000
to get anywhere

1024
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:33,679

1025
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:36,358

1026
