1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:08,040
We're getting involved in this idea of

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:10,719
what we call Hemstead Project. Hempstead

3
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:12,000
Project.com. All right. But you can't

4
00:00:10,718 --> 00:00:13,439
Google it. You got to put in that little

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,480
address thing up there on the computer.

6
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:17,519
But hemstead

7
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,439
projectart.com. Uh, and that's really

8
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:21,399
about we want we think it's time to

9
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:23,839
start focusing energy on hemp

10
00:00:21,399 --> 00:00:25,759
specifically as an alternative energy

11
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:27,920
and economy and and something that's

12
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,000
healthy for the earth. So, we're we're

13
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,480
looking at trying to encourage people

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,640
that agree with that to take any kind of

15
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:38,159
act on it however they know how to act,

16
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:40,239
but to not be silent. Do anything do

17
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:43,839
anything that you can because it all

18
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:44,878
adds up. Uh well on the hemp said thing

19
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,520
one one of the things we've done on the

20
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:49,759
site is we put links so that people can

21
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,200
go and find out about hemp because I

22
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:54,079
think a lot of people don't really

23
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:57,120
understand what hemp can do you know I

24
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:59,039
mean as a resource from food uh people I

25
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:01,839
don't think people really understand. So

26
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,840
if people would go look and and at least

27
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,359
check it out check out the facts about

28
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,040
what it's really all about and then if

29
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:08,959
they're in agreement on that act on it.

30
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,720
Yeah.

31
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:13,039
I always ask everybody this one

32
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:15,118
question. If you could say anything to

33
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,840
the marijuana community, what would it

34
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:20,840
be?

35
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:23,359
Get out there and put these efforts into

36
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:25,200
hemp. The same energy and effort that

37
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:28,319
was put into medical marijuana by the

38
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,560
marijuana people, THC people, I think

39
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:32,478
that same energy should be put into

40
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,240
hemp. I think by putting that energy

41
00:01:32,478 --> 00:01:35,840
into hemp, it's more consistent because

42
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:37,920
when we go for the medical marijuana,

43
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,759
that's just for us. When we go for the

44
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,920
hemp, we're now repaying the earth

45
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:43,519
because it's for the earth as well as

46
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,519
for us because it's healthy for the

47
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:47,200
earth. We've used medical marijuana and

48
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:49,359
wanted it because it's healthy for us.

49
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,719
Well, the same thing applies. Hemp is

50
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:52,478
healthy for the earth. So, I would like

51
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:54,719
to see the medical marijuana put some of

52
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:56,560
the same intensity and energy into now

53
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:59,359
getting medicine for the earth that was

54
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:02,560
used to get it for ourselves. Yes. Yes.

55
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:04,319
I agree. I' I'd like to see uh hemp

56
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,320
around the world. I think that it could

57
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:07,599
be solving a lot of the world's

58
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:09,758
problems. Well, this is what I'm saying.

59
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:11,280
See, a lot of people think it this or

60
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:13,679
that, have opinions about it. So, what

61
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,680
I'm what we're suggesting, go check out

62
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,319
the facts about what can really be done

63
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:21,040
with it. All right? I mean, from food to

64
00:02:18,318 --> 00:02:22,878
clo, go check out the facts. See what

65
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:24,479
can really be done with it. Because

66
00:02:22,878 --> 00:02:27,679
we've got to take it from being just an

67
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:29,840
abstraction hemp as an add-on. You know,

68
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,920
if we're talking about glo global what

69
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,360
that global warming, climate change, all

70
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:35,280
of these things we're discussing and

71
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,840
talking about, hemp has a tremendous

72
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,318
impact on being able to to to help to

73
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,878
balance what's happening, you know. So,

74
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:43,919
yeah. So, we're asking people research,

75
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:45,518
check it out, and if they're in

76
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:46,799
agreement to act on it, and if they're

77
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,759
not in agreement, well, then they're not

78
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,760
in agreement.
