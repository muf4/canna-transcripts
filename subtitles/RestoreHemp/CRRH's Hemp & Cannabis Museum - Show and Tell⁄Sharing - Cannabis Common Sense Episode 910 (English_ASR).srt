1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,799
here is our show-and-tell our sharing

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:07,378
for tonight this first thing is a

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:13,019
specific medicine container you see it

4
00:00:07,378 --> 00:00:15,178
says American him it says it's great

5
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:17,670
I'll read the label it says great for

6
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:21,240
nervous depression irritation of the

7
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:26,160
genitourinary tract painful mik duration

8
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:29,879
and and are use for scalding burning

9
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:34,980
frequent to low mental conditions

10
00:00:29,879 --> 00:00:36,920
wakefulness this is just recommended for

11
00:00:34,979 --> 00:00:39,839
just about everything and it's got a

12
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:42,059
date on the back it says American hemp

13
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,969
is considered an anodyne hypnotic

14
00:00:42,058 --> 00:00:47,820
antispasmodic producing sleep even when

15
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:49,170
opium and morphine fail deficient in

16
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:55,530
delirium tremens which is what

17
00:00:49,170 --> 00:01:01,230
alcoholics get infantile convulsions and

18
00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:03,379
fevers neuralgia gout rheumatism low

19
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:06,060
mental conditions insanity and

20
00:01:03,378 --> 00:01:08,759
inflammatory conditions it's often

21
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:12,240
preferable to opium and where opium

22
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:14,790
disagrees so that's what it says on this

23
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:21,169
jar right there in tiny letters I read

24
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:21,170
it and this one is from a currently

25
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:27,270
operating company parke-davis

26
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:29,100
this is in a solid powdered extract and

27
00:01:27,269 --> 00:01:31,228
you see it has about half of the

28
00:01:29,099 --> 00:01:34,589
containers are still in here this is

29
00:01:31,228 --> 00:01:36,810
from 1910 says Indian cannabis on this

30
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:38,728
little label in the back and it's a park

31
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:39,450
Davis product produced in Detroit

32
00:01:38,728 --> 00:01:42,750
Michigan

33
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:44,399
it is powdered hashish or Keith we often

34
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:47,609
call it but they call it powdered

35
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:49,950
extract of cannabis right next to it is

36
00:01:47,609 --> 00:01:51,390
another powdered extract to cannabis

37
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:53,759
let's get it away from the leaf a little

38
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:57,030
bit there we go oh no back the other way

39
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:59,090
there there that's better so powdered

40
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:02,460
this one's from Eli Lilly and I have a

41
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:06,320
series of Eli Lilly products here that

42
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:10,019
are going to the cannabis museum in

43
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:11,349
Athens Ohio here in short order but this

44
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,840
is a

45
00:02:11,349 --> 00:02:16,090
a specific powdered cannabis product

46
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,430
then right next to it from the Merrill

47
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:20,710
company is also a powdered extract to

48
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:26,349
cannabis all three of these jars were

49
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:28,210
made to hold one two three on ounce of

50
00:02:26,349 --> 00:02:31,329
cannabis in fact this one even says

51
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:33,370
right on the back one ounce so you can

52
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:35,110
see this one's empty this is the only

53
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:37,810
one that has some of the contents in it

54
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:40,240
right next to it here maybe you can

55
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:41,560
close in a little bit on that this is

56
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,659
clora dime

57
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:46,840
clora Dyne was a medicine for pain and

58
00:02:43,659 --> 00:02:49,590
sleep and it's also from Eli Lilly it is

59
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:53,349
cannabis morphine

60
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:55,450
peppermint chloroform and Cass pick'em

61
00:02:53,349 --> 00:02:58,289
so this has a lot of different things in

62
00:02:55,449 --> 00:03:04,000
this clora dime from Eli Lilly and

63
00:02:58,289 --> 00:03:07,780
Indianapolis and so it was used for pain

64
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:11,020
and spasms and so it like again I said

65
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:12,969
again it has morphine cannabis capsicum

66
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:16,060
chloroform this stuff will just knock

67
00:03:12,969 --> 00:03:20,289
you out basically then right next to it

68
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:24,250
we have another Eli Lilly product

69
00:03:20,289 --> 00:03:27,489
cannabis tincture number 17 Eli Lilly

70
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:30,520
parke-davis these guys each had over two

71
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:32,320
dozen different cannabis products and

72
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:34,770
that were slightly different in the the

73
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:38,379
extracting agent and the contents and

74
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:42,040
concentrations so this was their number

75
00:03:38,379 --> 00:03:45,099
17 cannabis teacher right next to it

76
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:47,199
here we have number 96 you see it says

77
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:49,719
poison they thought it was poison for a

78
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:51,759
while this bottles from 1880s they

79
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:56,949
thought you could over Dave's overdose

80
00:03:51,759 --> 00:04:00,519
on it well it was one ounce of cannabis

81
00:03:56,949 --> 00:04:02,909
extract in nine ounces of alcohol that's

82
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:06,460
what it says on there so this is a

83
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:10,389
number 96 and right here next to it all

84
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:17,920
a little bigger version of number 96

85
00:04:10,389 --> 00:04:20,469
again from about 1905 1900 and ten years

86
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:24,189
old here and so then right next to it we

87
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:25,160
have one from 1870 and this one is

88
00:04:24,189 --> 00:04:28,189
particularly interests

89
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:31,160
it has a label here on the back it isn't

90
00:04:28,189 --> 00:04:35,000
in real good shape this is cannabis

91
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:38,060
indica USP on the back of it here it

92
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:41,959
says not poisonous according to the best

93
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:45,879
authorities though formerly regarded so

94
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:51,019
it's an antispasmodic analgesic and

95
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:55,300
aesthetic and narcotic it's an

96
00:04:51,019 --> 00:05:00,769
aphrodisiac specifically recommended in

97
00:04:55,300 --> 00:05:03,290
spasmodic conditions of and painful

98
00:05:00,769 --> 00:05:08,269
ailments for preventing rather than

99
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:16,010
treating migraines almost a specific in

100
00:05:08,269 --> 00:05:18,229
that form insanity peculiar to women in

101
00:05:16,009 --> 00:05:21,110
other words menstrual problems diagnosed

102
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:23,240
by mental worry our moral shock so if

103
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:26,509
you're a woman on PMS and you have

104
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:29,000
mental worry or moral shock this company

105
00:05:26,509 --> 00:05:36,430
thought this was the thing for you it's

106
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:39,199
an ant it goes on and says in the best

107
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:41,060
known hypnotic and delirium tremens

108
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,979
again if you're an alcoholic this would

109
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:47,120
help you get off the out the booze it's

110
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:49,220
anodyne power is marked in chronic myth

111
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:52,689
tree itis and dis Minori a-- disprin

112
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:58,450
oriya again is menstrual pains used with

113
00:05:52,689 --> 00:06:02,029
excellent results in habituates of opium

114
00:05:58,449 --> 00:06:04,719
chloroform and cocaine use so they also

115
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:09,139
recommended it to get off opium

116
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:13,669
chloroform and cocaine in hysterical

117
00:06:09,139 --> 00:06:16,418
cases as claimed by coral or opium it's

118
00:06:13,668 --> 00:06:22,490
acting especially well so that's what

119
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:26,180
Eli Lilly said in approximately 1870

120
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:30,519
then right next door we have this coffin

121
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:34,250
cold blossom and it is alcohol

122
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:37,219
chloroform and antimony tart and so it

123
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:39,379
has a bottle inside and this nifty

124
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:41,990
little thing here here is the

125
00:06:39,379 --> 00:06:44,449
and so maybe we can close in on that a

126
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:51,918
little bit then it has this insert that

127
00:06:44,449 --> 00:06:54,919
is actually printed in 13 different

128
00:06:51,918 --> 00:06:57,109
languages you can read in 13 languages

129
00:06:54,918 --> 00:06:59,149
in case you're you know newly immigrated

130
00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:04,939
here this was a medicine this is from

131
00:06:59,149 --> 00:07:07,579
1885 it was produced in Pennsylvania

132
00:07:04,939 --> 00:07:11,120
Plymouth Pennsylvania right next to it

133
00:07:07,579 --> 00:07:13,399
we have our regular hemp flame of

134
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,978
freedom this is hemp seed oil with a

135
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:16,549
hemp wick this is next week's wick right

136
00:07:15,978 --> 00:07:19,339
here folks

137
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:21,050
and this is some raw hemp oil and this

138
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:22,939
is after we've had the hip wick in there

139
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:25,340
and burning it this is just a little

140
00:07:22,939 --> 00:07:27,168
shot glass with some hip seed oil in it

141
00:07:25,339 --> 00:07:29,060
we light it up so this is the reason

142
00:07:27,168 --> 00:07:31,598
that marijuana is illegal it's not a

143
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:34,639
coincidence I believe that an Israeli

144
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:37,098
Canadian energy company called a dear

145
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:41,720
energy again you can look them up a dir

146
00:07:37,098 --> 00:07:44,180
a energy.com this Israeli Canadian oil

147
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:45,949
company I've been talking for years that

148
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:49,250
the only reason that marijuana is

149
00:07:45,949 --> 00:07:50,990
illegal isn't really about drugs it's

150
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:53,120
really about money and power in the

151
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:55,280
continued centralization of economic and

152
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,348
political control and specifically about

153
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:59,059
energy and fiber so these are the

154
00:07:57,348 --> 00:08:02,050
reasons marijuana is illegal they don't

155
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:04,610
want us to have this naturally the

156
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:06,740
centralized resource they want us to

157
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:09,889
have to buy it from them does that sound

158
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:12,889
familiar to you anyway here's our hip

159
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:15,468
ball of twine and this is hip creat its

160
00:08:12,889 --> 00:08:18,439
limestone powdered down called quicklime

161
00:08:15,468 --> 00:08:20,839
and it's broken up and it's stronger

162
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:23,750
than concrete and then this is a little

163
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:24,439
hip hip stock we like him to doctor

164
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:27,918
around here don't we

165
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:31,389
Eric yes all right so that's the end of

166
00:08:27,918 --> 00:08:31,389
our show and tell for tonight
