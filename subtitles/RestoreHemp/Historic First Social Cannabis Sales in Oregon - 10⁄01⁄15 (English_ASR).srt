1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,600
it's great to finally be able to see

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:08,240
legal cannabis and to buy some legally

3
00:00:05,599 --> 00:00:10,678
as an adult you I've been growing my own

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,759
so I haven't really gone to any of these

5
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:15,798
dispensaries before this is the first

6
00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:19,480
time I've ever bought marijuana over a

7
00:00:15,798 --> 00:00:21,480
counter at a cash register and uh it's

8
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:23,679
what we've been working for for many

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:26,320
many years and I'm just happy the day is

10
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:29,960
finally come you know I asked for a Jack

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,960
Herer joint here uh thinking I I re

12
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:34,200
recognize that name he would be so proud

13
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:36,799
to be here today there's no doubt about

14
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:39,320
it he petitioned hundreds maybe

15
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:40,959
thousands of hours here in Oregon his

16
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:43,600
book was written right here in Oregon

17
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:46,320
for the first edition so this is uh an

18
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,480
exciting day well I I figured I'd

19
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,920
probably be doing this in about

20
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:53,439
1972 uh but it's taken a few years

21
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:55,960
longer uh I've been going to Amsterdam

22
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:58,439
for a very long time and and buying

23
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:00,840
recreational and social marijuana over

24
00:00:58,439 --> 00:01:02,718
the counter and and sharing it and we've

25
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,320
got a long way to go before we're at

26
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:08,519
that level uh but it's really great to

27
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:10,839
see a a good start here today uh it

28
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:13,519
feels great you know it's a real surreal

29
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:16,118
moment uh you know talking to you about

30
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:19,118
the uh progress that we've made and

31
00:01:16,118 --> 00:01:21,560
really the long hard fight over decades

32
00:01:19,118 --> 00:01:24,959
uh yeah I think about people like LK Jim

33
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:26,920
Greg Jim clar you know people that uh

34
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:29,559
put in decades to this fight who aren't

35
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:32,439
with us who weren't able to see a day

36
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:35,759
like today day and uh it means a lot uh

37
00:01:32,438 --> 00:01:37,359
for a lot of people um when I was in

38
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,959
high school I first want to debate about

39
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:42,200
marijuana legalization back in like

40
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:44,359
1995 uh in college I helped

41
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:46,640
decriminalize marijuana in Columbia

42
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:49,200
Missouri and my goal was to help

43
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,000
legalize the state by 2020 you know and

44
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,520
Colorado and Washington legalized in

45
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:58,399
2012 and then Oregon Alaska and DC in

46
00:01:54,519 --> 00:02:00,239
2014 and so to have a day like today

47
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:04,159
it's really a day for celebration a day

48
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:06,798
for reflection um but I know in my heart

49
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:09,000
that despite the improvements we still

50
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,759
need to make here in Oran that we're

51
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,159
going to remain Vigilant and we're going

52
00:02:10,758 --> 00:02:15,279
to have a law that can be the model for

53
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:18,199
the rest of the country and we can stop

54
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,719
this insane and barbaric practice of

55
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:22,399
arresting and jailing people for

56
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:24,840
cannabis all across the country so today

57
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,800
is is a great day each step of the way

58
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,759
has been very surreal a lot of people

59
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,080
have been waiting a long time to see

60
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:33,280
this happen it's historical moment that

61
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:35,280
we're all finally able to enjoy and it

62
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,159
is showing the freedom that we all

63
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,360
should have and the right that we all

64
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:41,598
should have to recreate not only

65
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,159
Medicaid it's unbelievable we thought

66
00:02:41,598 --> 00:02:47,238
that this day would never going to come

67
00:02:44,158 --> 00:02:48,959
to reality actually but we're really

68
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:53,039
happy and we're happy for the people of

69
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:55,759
origon you know uh that uh you went

70
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:57,400
through the ballot and you succeed and

71
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:59,518
this is the result so we're really

72
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:01,400
excited to be here it's the way it

73
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,280
should be it's too bad it's taken so

74
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,719
long and the commuting is going to kill

75
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,519
me down from Canada but it's a true

76
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:09,878
pleasure to be able to act like a normal

77
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:13,200
person and get the product when you want

78
00:03:09,878 --> 00:03:13,199
it I'm so

79
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:24,000
exciting free fighting for legalization

80
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:26,000
this is a worldwide process then soon or

81
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,239
later we'll come to every single place

82
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,598
in every single spot in the world

83
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:33,000
because it's a medicine and just insane

84
00:03:30,598 --> 00:03:35,039
that has to be illegal so we're really

85
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,199
excited this is a a key moment in

86
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:39,199
history I guess it is

87
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:47,799
it's yeah I think that here in Oregon

88
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:50,318
we're going to show you know the cities

89
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:52,959
and counties in eastern Oregon that are

90
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:56,158
ban marijuana businesses that you can

91
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:58,680
have regulated sales create jobs

92
00:03:56,158 --> 00:04:00,759
generate Revenue the sky is not going to

93
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,239
fall and that's going to carry over to

94
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:06,199
more States and more and more states are

95
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:08,840
going to both legalize Adult Ed cannabis

96
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:11,639
but also medicinal cannabis as well each

97
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:15,280
of those states that comes into the

98
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:18,358
legalized realm that adds additional

99
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:21,560
senators and representatives uh

100
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:23,240
who represent people who are living in

101
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,879
states that have legalized marijuana of

102
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:28,840
some sort so um I think Congressman

103
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:31,319
blumire think believes 5 years um I

104
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:33,679
think within 10 for sure we're going to

105
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:36,439
repeal a federal prohibition it's going

106
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:39,079
to be left up to the states and that

107
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:42,680
Oregon with uh home

108
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:46,839
cultivation uh keeping medical no per se

109
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:48,478
DUI low taxes relatively low barriers to

110
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:51,038
entry we're going to have the best

111
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:52,599
policy in the country and unless States

112
00:04:51,038 --> 00:04:54,240
look at what we've done and even improve

113
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,320
upon what we done but I think of many

114
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,600
ways we're going to be a model for

115
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:59,719
everybody and then the United States

116
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,600
looking at a global sphere United States

117
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:03,840
has been the one pursuing the the Global

118
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,800
Drug War the global war on marijuana and

119
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:07,519
once the United States ends prohibition

120
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,240
I think we can we can expect most of the

121
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:11,240
world to do the same you know the

122
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:13,519
biggest thing is to educate people

123
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:15,800
educate your politicians educate your

124
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:18,879
family educate your friends that

125
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:21,400
marijuana is a good thing uh we need

126
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:24,839
hemp for our environment we need

127
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:28,560
cannabis for many different physical

128
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:30,239
issues so uh uh the more alcohol we can

129
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,600
replace with cannabis the better off

130
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,600
we'll all be
