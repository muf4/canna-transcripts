1
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,240
uh

2
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:19,239
uh

3
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:07,599
keep thinking hard drinking no feeling

4
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,920
ain't seen tomorrow yet

5
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:13,438
no sleep until you're six feet sinking

6
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:15,920
no food till summer

7
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:19,519
i'm loving all the good people running

8
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:22,000
from the life are left behind

9
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:26,759
i don't mind if you treat me unkind

10
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,759
cause i'm leaving all the time

11
00:01:36,078 --> 00:01:40,199
till you start to go

12
00:01:42,078 --> 00:01:45,438
until you start to go

13
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:55,599
sweet dreaming is the one thing

14
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:57,679
screaming from the pages of her soul

15
00:01:55,599 --> 00:02:02,839
she's so heavy but she thinks she's

16
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,840
ready to escape the world she knows

17
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,360
till you start to go

18
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:05,280
i don't tell me that i got a thing heavy

19
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:08,239
cause my mind don't bend that way

20
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:11,680
i walk steady with my guitar already no

21
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:13,680
reason i should stay

22
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:18,760
life is just like a ripple from the

23
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,760
tickle of a raindrop on the sea

24
00:03:30,158 --> 00:03:33,840
no matter who you are

25
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,760
no matter who you are

26
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:51,400
until you start to go

27
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,800
so

28
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,160

29
00:05:50,478 --> 00:05:53,839
