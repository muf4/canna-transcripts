of the reason why you know we found that

51
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:38,050
our our show here cameras common sense

is so popular is that we're providing

53
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:42,650
common sense

you know some real answers about this

55
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:47,599
whole issue and I'm sure is probably

56
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:49,400
some of our you know what the Portland

63
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:02,840
just a hopeless nuts because you're

64
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:05,329
following orders hopefully it's not

65
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:08,989
because you want that next paycheck yeah

66
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:11,810
stop tyranny stop arresting nonviolent

67
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:14,239
marijuana offenders support the Oregon

70
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:21,310
and thanks Paula for minding me octa

71
00:03:18,229 --> 00:03:24,560
will will allow doctors to prescribe

72
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:26,390
medical marijuana to patients at cost

73
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,180
through they can then pick up at a

74
00:03:26,389 --> 00:03:32,089
pharmacy you can go to your local you

75
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:34,700
know Rite Aid or Walgreens or Fred Meyer

76
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:36,979
or any any pharmacy of your choosing and

77
00:03:34,699 --> 00:03:39,828
and pick up your prescription they're a

78
00:03:36,979 --> 00:03:40,429
lot easier than try and find a black

79
00:03:39,829 --> 00:03:42,590
market

80
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:45,829
another thing that'll do it will allow

81
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:49,219
our farmers to grow industrial hemp in

82
00:03:45,829 --> 00:03:50,989
which they will give them put them in

83
00:03:49,219 --> 00:03:53,239
the forefront of the emerging market

84
00:03:50,989 --> 00:03:54,859
around the world for industrial hemp you

85
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:56,810
know cannabis taking off on industrial

86
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:58,819
hemp movement now Europe's been on it

87
00:03:56,810 --> 00:04:01,340
for a few years now the US has fallen

88
00:03:58,818 --> 00:04:04,578
behind in this new emerging market it's

89
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:06,769
like if say 20 years ago the US said ban

90
00:04:04,579 --> 00:04:09,500
computers here the rest world would have

91
00:04:06,769 --> 00:04:12,560
leaped ahead with computers and we'd be

92
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:14,959
sitting here doing nothing and and it's

93
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,759
a good thing we didn't you know and a

94
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,798
good analogy because right now our

95
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:21,798
farmers are falling farther and farther

96
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:23,719
behind Canada this year has allowed the

97
00:04:21,798 --> 00:04:25,429
first commercial hemp crop yeah so in

98
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:27,349
Europe its subsidized more than any

99
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:29,780
other crop yeah because they realized

100
00:04:27,348 --> 00:04:31,519
the benefits of it which we can get into

101
00:04:29,779 --> 00:04:34,069
a little bit later but the other main

102
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:39,500
aspect of our initiative which would do

103
00:04:34,069 --> 00:04:42,319
and be allow sale to adults so long sale

104
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:46,329
marijuana to adults through state-run

105
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:48,978
stores ie the liquor store system or in

106
00:04:46,329 --> 00:04:50,870
bars and clubs the bars and clubs would

107
00:04:48,978 --> 00:04:53,599
have to sell alcohol but they'd be

108
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:57,590
license and run just like a the

109
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:59,930
today you know it's well yeah you know

110
00:04:57,589 --> 00:05:01,819
so it's regulated so you know people

111
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:05,120
know what's going on and then that way

112
00:05:01,819 --> 00:05:06,079
no minors can have access and then of

113
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,209
course they would that would be DEP

114
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:10,879
aspect would be taxed directly I know

115
00:05:08,209 --> 00:05:12,439
adult recreational sales would be taxed

116
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:14,180
and I think that would raise more money

117
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:17,029
than the lottery we really can't

118
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:19,220
quantify it officially well and then

119
00:05:17,029 --> 00:05:21,619
also to I mean people are thinking more

120
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:23,420
and more about you know the law is not

121
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:26,030
such a good thing I mean there was a

122
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:28,250
proposed initiative this year about bein

123
00:05:26,029 --> 00:05:30,889
lottery here in Oregon but they backed

124
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:32,060
off for a while I think partly because

125
00:05:30,889 --> 00:05:33,649
they realized there wasn't the

126
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:35,180
replacement revenue but something like

127
00:05:33,649 --> 00:05:37,339
this could be the replacement revenue

128
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:39,139
for a lottery lot of people don't like

129
00:05:37,339 --> 00:05:41,569
the lottery because specially video

130
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:43,669
poker a lot of people get addicted to

131
00:05:41,569 --> 00:05:47,089
that so easily and then there goes our

132
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:48,319
whole paycheck and and so this could be

133
00:05:47,089 --> 00:05:51,049
the way you know this could be the

134
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:53,389
answer and part gonna raise a lot of

135
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:55,550
money when we regulate marijuana yeah if

136
00:05:53,389 --> 00:05:58,849
Oregon's the first state to regulate the

137
00:05:55,550 --> 00:06:01,579
sale of marijuana to adults then we're

138
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:03,920
gonna put our industries at the

139
00:06:01,579 --> 00:06:07,159
forefront of an exciting new industry

140
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:09,800
we're gonna just make lots and lots of

141
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:12,020
money there farmers are gonna be happy

142
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:14,420
the tourism industry is gonna be happy

143
00:06:12,019 --> 00:06:16,490
the liquor store owners are gonna be

144
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:19,069
happy the bars and coffee shops that get

145
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:21,410
a license and don't let minors in

146
00:06:19,069 --> 00:06:24,230
they're gonna be happy well and all the

147
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:26,600
small little crafters out there who can

148
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:28,910
take industrial hemp products and make

149
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:32,480
them into clothing you know with

150
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:34,520
different fiber making it into food make

151
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:38,090
it into oil there's a lot of things they

152
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:40,310
can do and you know I think that we'll

153
00:06:38,089 --> 00:06:43,759
have a much healthier population here

154
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:45,079
because of other medicinal use you know

155
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:47,360
being you know it's because they'll be

156
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:49,519
up to a doctor and a patient for what

157
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,590
its prescribed for you know there's not

158
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:53,870
a checkoff list saying okay this is what

159
00:06:51,589 --> 00:06:54,919
only the only way you can prescribe own

160
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:57,560
things you can prescribe marijuana

161
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:59,210
forming this list here you know it's

162
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:01,699
like now it's up to the doctor and up to

163
00:06:59,209 --> 00:07:03,560
the patient because we know that you

164
00:07:01,699 --> 00:07:05,478
know medical science you know they're

165
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,509
discover new things every single day and

166
00:07:05,478 --> 00:07:08,759
so moves

167
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:11,490
say that tomorrow they may find another

168
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:13,829
good use medical use for for cannabis

169
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:16,650
it's true you know there are several

170
00:07:13,829 --> 00:07:19,229
different compounds in cannabis or

171
00:07:16,649 --> 00:07:21,689
marijuana that have medicinal benefits a

172
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:24,030
lot of people talk about THC or

173
00:07:21,689 --> 00:07:26,850
tetrahydrocannabinol and that's useful

174
00:07:24,029 --> 00:07:28,799
for lowering nausea however if you're

175
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:31,590
pretty nauseous might be hard to keep

176
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:35,129
that pill down there are other things

177
00:07:31,589 --> 00:07:36,929
though that THC doesn't treat but that

178
00:07:35,129 --> 00:07:39,319
marijuana does and that's because it has

179
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:42,509
other compounds that are medicinally

180
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:46,459
effective one of them is cannabidiol or

181
00:07:42,509 --> 00:07:50,459
CBD and that controls muscle spasms and

182
00:07:46,459 --> 00:07:55,159
has an analgesic effect then their CBC

183
00:07:50,459 --> 00:07:58,079
and cannabic Romijn and that is an

184
00:07:55,160 --> 00:08:00,480
antibiotic and has some other medicinal

185
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:03,180
properties those drugs aren't available

186
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:05,700
by prescription they're not synthesized

187
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:09,540
and sold pharmaceutically the way that

188
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:10,789
marijuana is so we want our farmers and

189
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:13,350
[Music]

190
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:17,340
industries to have access to just those

191
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:19,020
items so that they can raise lots and

192
00:08:17,339 --> 00:08:21,000
lots of money you know yeah I think it's

193
00:08:19,019 --> 00:08:23,009
you know it's it's a fascinating thing

194
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,980
and you know one thing I want to talk

195
00:08:23,009 --> 00:08:28,740
about is how just oh really recently in

196
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:31,020
Washington County for the first times

197
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:33,990
that I'm aware of an attorney was able

198
00:08:31,019 --> 00:08:37,110
to raise the choice of Evil's defense in

199
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:39,418
a case of a patient multiple sclerosis

200
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:42,570
patient who was found growing some

201
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:45,509
plants you know this patient said that

202
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:47,400
he tried you know you know buying on a

203
00:08:45,509 --> 00:08:50,159
street and black market but that was

204
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:51,779
expensive and it was scary you know he

205
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:54,139
didn't like having to drive you know

206
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:56,610
down to Portland here when the cannabis

207
00:08:54,139 --> 00:08:58,139
buyers club was operating you need it

208
00:08:56,610 --> 00:09:00,060
you know he didn't like that whole scene

209
00:08:58,139 --> 00:09:03,120
and so he just well you know grew a few

210
00:09:00,059 --> 00:09:04,439
plants at his home there because it

211
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,450
helped him out he said he helped

212
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:08,790
momentously multiple sclerosis I've seen

213
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:11,550
multiple sclerosis patients use

214
00:09:08,789 --> 00:09:16,019
marijuana I've seen them locked in a

215
00:09:11,549 --> 00:09:18,000
spasm we're almost convulsing and taking

216
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:19,769
they couldn't swallow a pill and keep it

217
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,350
down and wait an hour for it to take

218
00:09:19,769 --> 00:09:22,449
effect

219
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:24,009
but a puff or two of marijuana Ellis

220
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:25,920
yeah what you know and that's what this

221
00:09:24,009 --> 00:09:29,110
gentleman said then and he was able to

222
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:32,500
they brought in a doctor who testified

223
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:35,730
that yes you've seen you know it worked

224
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:39,120
and documented case he had documented a

225
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:41,970
scientific study of this patient and ms

226
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:45,070
elsewhere and it at work and they

227
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:47,529
although the jury still convicted as

228
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:49,390
person I think it's a victory the fact

229
00:09:47,529 --> 00:09:51,819
that the media reported the fact that

230
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:54,419
there was a choice of u.s. defense and a

231
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:57,220
medical doctor testifying as an expert

232
00:09:54,419 --> 00:10:00,099
that the fact that marijuana is

233
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:01,990
effective for multiple sclerosis I mean

234
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:04,779
I you know think that's a great victory

235
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:06,039
you know overall for the movement but

236
00:10:04,779 --> 00:10:08,649
it's a you know defeat for the

237
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:11,740
individual right you know this

238
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:13,590
individual I mean I hope that you know

239
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:15,700
that they don't sentence him too harshly

240
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:18,190
now you said he didn't want to be a

241
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:21,220
poster boy for the legalization of

242
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:23,680
marijuana movement but he was willing to

243
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:26,800
accept that role because he shoved upon

244
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:30,129
him well we're we don't need to shove

245
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:34,269
this role of a convicted felon this role

246
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:35,919
of deviance on any more people yeah

247
00:10:34,269 --> 00:10:38,889
especially a you know a patient a

248
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:41,740
medical user hears somebody who has you

249
00:10:38,889 --> 00:10:43,509
know a horrible disease condition am not

250
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:45,340
sure if to call disease or condition but

251
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:48,669
somebody who has this I mean it's just I

252
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:51,519
mean people have this you know it's just

253
00:10:48,669 --> 00:10:55,809
horrible to have and you know and I

254
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:59,949
think anybody who knows an MS patient

255
00:10:55,809 --> 00:11:01,419
realized that they definitely have great

256
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:05,980
benefits from using marijuana

257
00:11:01,419 --> 00:11:08,169
medicinally and so once again folks give

258
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:11,320

use of marijuana you know there's a

301
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:06,450
increasing o dialog going on right now

302
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:09,820
among cannabis activist cannabis users

303
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:11,379
about the fact that people are saying

304
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:15,550
more and more that all use of cannabis

305
00:13:11,379 --> 00:13:17,679
is medicinal that we shouldn't be afraid

306
00:13:15,549 --> 00:13:20,409
to state that that the fact that

307
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:22,419
everybody uses it too weathers to relax

308
00:13:20,409 --> 00:13:24,490
and unwind that's like medicine I mean

309
00:13:22,419 --> 00:13:26,769
like some people take an aspirin to help

310
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:28,210
them relax after you know a little

311
00:13:26,769 --> 00:13:30,340
headache after a hard day of running or

312
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:33,310
you after your muscles are tight or

313
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:37,330
playing tennis whatever or some people

314
00:13:33,309 --> 00:13:38,949
relax with a you know alcohol and and to

315
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:41,500
that that's medicine you know anything

316
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:43,660
that anything that changes your state of

317
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:46,059
mind is medicine according to some

318
00:13:43,659 --> 00:13:47,469
definitions and you know people say we

319
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:51,159
shouldn't be afraid of that

320
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:53,200
say that all use is medicinal and that

321
00:13:51,159 --> 00:13:54,429
should be up to the to the user to

322
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:57,070
decide how they want to medicate

323
00:13:54,429 --> 00:13:59,349
themselves exactly and in a lot of cases

324
00:13:57,070 --> 00:14:02,470
people are medicating themselves

325
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:03,790
medicinally for a variety of different

326
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:06,040
things that aren't recognized

327
00:14:03,789 --> 00:14:07,750
traditionally in science like depression

328
00:14:06,039 --> 00:14:11,049
I've known people who have depression

329
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:13,659
who've given up very dangerous drugs and

330
00:14:11,049 --> 00:14:16,029
just use marijuana and find that it

331
00:14:13,659 --> 00:14:19,120
controls their depression better than

332
00:14:16,029 --> 00:14:21,339
the very dangerous drugs do yeah I mean

333
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,990
it's just you know I mean I'd say I

334
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:25,509
think it's just an interesting dialogue

335
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:27,759
that's starting to happen among some

336
00:14:25,509 --> 00:14:29,919
people who are who were just have the

337
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:32,009
the checklist mentality of you know

338
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:34,599
marijuana is only good for these these

339
00:14:32,009 --> 00:14:35,980
specified things and and if you're try

340
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:38,170
and say it's good for anything else why

341
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:39,850
then you're just you know harming the

342
00:14:38,169 --> 00:14:41,949
cause and and I don't know I'm still

343
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:44,170
learning myself on that but I'm trying

344
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:48,640
to think that more and more you know all

345
00:14:44,169 --> 00:14:50,559
use of cannabis is medicinal I know that

346
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:52,750
dialogue is really taking place in

347
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:54,849
California which is in total at the

348
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:57,850
forefront these days of medical

349
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:59,889
marijuana and the attacks by the federal

350
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:03,460
government and the California Attorney

351
00:14:59,889 --> 00:15:06,069
General and you were mentioning earlier

352
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:08,320
today about the would happen down there

353
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:11,170
with Dennis Peron exactly Dennis Peron

354
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:14,440
was one of the people who came up with

355
00:15:11,169 --> 00:15:16,120
the concept of pushing for medical

356
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:17,170
marijuana politically through the

357
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:19,360
initiative process

358
00:15:17,169 --> 00:15:22,929
he passed an initiative in the city of

359
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:27,460
San Francisco back in back I think it

360
00:15:22,929 --> 00:15:30,519
was like 77 that got 70% of the vote the

361
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:32,820
highest plurality in any election ever

362
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:35,919
in San Francisco for medical marijuana

363
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:40,629
passed another citywide San Francisco

364
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:43,929
proposition to de-emphasize and defund

365
00:15:40,629 --> 00:15:48,129
all marijuana enforcement by the city of

366
00:15:43,929 --> 00:15:50,979
San Francisco then back in 95 and 96 he

367
00:15:48,129 --> 00:15:54,000
organized a statewide Medical Marijuana

368
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:56,289
petition known as the compassionate use

369
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,889
California's for compassionate use and

370
00:15:56,289 --> 00:16:01,428
that passed and it's caused the federal

371
00:15:59,889 --> 00:16:05,999
government a lot of heartache

372
00:16:01,428 --> 00:16:07,769
headaches I should say and a good thing

373
00:16:05,999 --> 00:16:09,839
too because it's brought the debate to

374
00:16:07,769 --> 00:16:11,668
the forefront yeah it is I mean it's it

375
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,589
makes the federal government look like

376
00:16:11,668 --> 00:16:15,629
hypocrites if they take medicine away

377
00:16:13,589 --> 00:16:18,179
from people you know in a state where

378
00:16:15,629 --> 00:16:20,069
California said marijuana is medicine

379
00:16:18,178 --> 00:16:22,198
and here's the government coming in

380
00:16:20,068 --> 00:16:24,688
taking away people's medicine I mean you

381
00:16:22,198 --> 00:16:26,578
know it's just bad PR you know they you

382
00:16:24,688 --> 00:16:29,219
know they still don't know how to deal

383
00:16:26,578 --> 00:16:30,899
with it yet they've raised some mclubbe

384
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:33,928
down there and then Dennis Peron had to

385
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:36,269
close his club yeah he said and admitted

386
00:16:33,928 --> 00:16:39,088
that he had helped us apply marijuana to

387
00:16:36,269 --> 00:16:42,859
other clubs and that wasn't specifically

388
00:16:39,089 --> 00:16:45,779
written into his initiative and so the

389
00:16:42,859 --> 00:16:49,139
judge reluctantly said signed an order

390
00:16:45,778 --> 00:16:51,869
to close the club but the police chief

391
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:55,318
and the district attorney in San

392
00:16:51,869 --> 00:16:57,658
Francisco Hallinan and the mayor Willie

393
00:16:55,318 --> 00:17:00,208
Brown all said that they support the

394
00:16:57,658 --> 00:17:03,178
club and the next day in reopened and

395
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:05,849
hazel Rogers took over the cannabis

396
00:17:03,178 --> 00:17:08,519
buyers club in San Francisco the largest

397
00:17:05,849 --> 00:17:14,328
in the nation and she's a 72 year old

398
00:17:08,519 --> 00:17:19,439
grandmother and the city endorses her

399
00:17:14,328 --> 00:17:21,418
running the club and of the state

400
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:23,970
government the feds tried to close it

401
00:17:21,419 --> 00:17:26,788
down in a subsequent injunction but the

402
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:29,069
judge wouldn't issue the injunction so

403
00:17:26,788 --> 00:17:31,500
that's where it stands as of would we're

404
00:17:29,069 --> 00:17:33,480
taping exactly and then you know part of

405
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:37,980
the fact that he was supplying to other

406
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:39,389
clubs but also he was also he's a firm

407
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:43,740
believer than all use is medicinal

408
00:17:39,388 --> 00:17:45,209
exactly and you might say he's he as far

409
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:48,000
as I know he came up with that concept

410
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:49,679
yeah I mean I and and that's he is the

411
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,359
one that's you know brought to the

412
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,919
forefront you know even for that you

413
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:55,558
know for the checklist mentality folks

414
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:58,230
you know there's two two camps in

415
00:17:55,558 --> 00:18:00,658
California people for medical marijuana

416
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:02,128
there's you know Dennis Peron and other

417
00:18:00,659 --> 00:18:04,379
people saying that's like what we have a

418
00:18:02,128 --> 00:18:05,908
doctor in a patient want and then

419
00:18:04,378 --> 00:18:07,980
there's the checklist folks that saying

420
00:18:05,909 --> 00:18:11,369
it's a line for only for these things

421
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:12,868
and the the checklist folks had a lot of

422
00:18:11,368 --> 00:18:13,720
money still have a lot of money but

423
00:18:12,868 --> 00:18:16,539
they're losing

424
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:17,740
you know the public opinion is not on

425
00:18:16,539 --> 00:18:20,049
their side a public of pain in

426
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:21,370
California saying it's like what's the

427
00:18:20,049 --> 00:18:23,769
big deal and you know it's up to the

428
00:18:21,369 --> 00:18:25,989
individual you know and whatever doctor

429
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:27,639
you know our initiative goes just a

430
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:30,660
little bit farther than that we

431
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:32,590
implement the production of marijuana

432
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:35,259
according to the guidelines of

433
00:18:32,589 --> 00:18:37,809
international treaty now the courts have

434
00:18:35,259 --> 00:18:40,299
ruled that international treaties have

435
00:18:37,809 --> 00:18:44,769
the same weight as the Constitution so

436
00:18:40,299 --> 00:18:46,720
we complied with the conditions set by

437
00:18:44,769 --> 00:18:48,750
the Single Convention treaty in the

438
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:53,110
Oregon cannabis Tax Act we use their

439
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:55,329
specific controls in terms of the

440
00:18:53,109 --> 00:18:58,689
licensing requirements requirements

441
00:18:55,329 --> 00:19:00,399
under the Oregon cannabis Tax Act yeah

442
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:03,460
you know and of course now that there's

443
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:05,710
a movement of fun a front foot in the

444
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:07,420
United Nations to change that you know

445
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:09,370
single convention to make it stronger

446
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:10,870
because they realize people like us and

447
00:19:09,369 --> 00:19:12,039
other people around the world are

448
00:19:10,869 --> 00:19:13,989
starting to say hey you know this is a

449
00:19:12,039 --> 00:19:16,149
way to regulate it to get it back from

450
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:18,400
you know the underground and and the

451
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:21,280
black market bringing above-ground so

452
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:23,680
exactly we pioneered that so there's you

453
00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:25,809
know there's movement afoot to tighten

454
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:27,549
it all up and so it's real interesting

455
00:19:25,809 --> 00:19:29,349
you know I know there's you know folks

456
00:19:27,549 --> 00:19:32,109
over in Europe right now being really

457
00:19:29,349 --> 00:19:33,519
strong keeping an eye on that because

458
00:19:32,109 --> 00:19:35,709
they've got a strong movement over there

459
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:38,799
and a lot of these they had a big march

460
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:40,720
in London recently so that's you know

461
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:42,549
and didn't get a lot of publicity here

462
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,799
in the u.s. of course you know as a

463
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:49,389
major major march and protests in London

464
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:51,700
and about freeing cannabis right and you

465
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:53,860
know if they're trying to strengthen the

466
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:56,500
treaties to stop our ability to do it we

467
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:58,089
better strike now while the iron is hot

468
00:19:56,500 --> 00:20:02,440
hot we better

469
00:19:58,089 --> 00:20:06,490
seize the day carpe diem call us at two

470
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:08,620
three five four six zero six because you

471
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:11,380
need to get involved to stop the war on

472
00:20:08,619 --> 00:20:13,509
drugs as I've often said and Paul might

473
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:16,030
be getting tired in you to hearing the

474
00:20:13,509 --> 00:20:17,769
war on drugs I firmly believe is the

475
00:20:16,029 --> 00:20:20,710
issue on which the future of freedom in

476
00:20:17,769 --> 00:20:24,069
America hinges help us protect freedom

477
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:28,350
help us restore him call two three five

478
00:20:24,069 --> 00:20:31,200
four six zero six yeah the one draw

479
00:20:28,349 --> 00:20:33,000
is a wait for the powers that be the

480
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,370
ruling class the owning class run a

481
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,849
column to control the rest of us to

482
00:20:35,369 --> 00:20:40,319
control probably the 80% of us that you

483
00:20:38,849 --> 00:20:43,139
know don't own everything in the world

484
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:45,839

to live you know and in a in a society

486
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:49,829
of tolerance and openness and you know

487
00:20:48,419 --> 00:20:51,690
they don't want that because they make

488
00:20:49,829 --> 00:20:53,819
their profits off of controlling folks

489
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:55,558

they feel is necessary for their

565

somebody who has you know and that

585
00:24:46,019 --> 00:24:51,509
person isn't a bad person that person

586

hold down a job you pay your taxes

588
00:24:53,538 --> 00:24:58,190
and you realize that it's not a big deal

589
00:24:55,819 --> 00:25:00,528
it's not the the big fear that the

590
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:03,129
government is is telling us you know I

591
00:25:00,528 --> 00:25:05,419
read folks out there like Gordon Smith

592
00:25:03,128 --> 00:25:08,478
senator Gordon Smith hiding behind

593
00:25:05,419 --> 00:25:11,359
children well I'm a County Sheriff Dan

594
00:25:08,479 --> 00:25:13,100
no le hiding behind children saying that

595
00:25:11,358 --> 00:25:14,658
oh we've got to like take away your

596
00:25:13,099 --> 00:25:16,819
right so we can protect children and

597
00:25:14,659 --> 00:25:18,830
it's like that's not true if they really

598
00:25:16,819 --> 00:25:20,960
want to protect children using that

599
00:25:18,829 --> 00:25:22,819
mentality they would take away alcohol

600
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:25,129
and prescription drugs the more people

601
00:25:22,819 --> 00:25:27,648
die from you know wrong use of

602
00:25:25,128 --> 00:25:30,168
prescription drugs every year then all

603
00:25:27,648 --> 00:25:31,428
the illegal drugs yeah by so will die

604
00:25:30,169 --> 00:25:32,869
from prescription yeah so they wouldn't

605
00:25:31,429 --> 00:25:35,149
give out any prescription drugs for that

606
00:25:32,868 --> 00:25:36,228
with that kind of mentality and I don't

607
00:25:35,148 --> 00:25:38,148
know why they're you know it just

608
00:25:36,229 --> 00:25:42,080
because they realize they can't win the

609
00:25:38,148 --> 00:25:46,308
argument on logic or reason they have to

610
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:47,749
hide behind children and it's sad you

611
00:25:46,308 --> 00:25:50,509
know grown men and women hiding behind

612
00:25:47,749 --> 00:25:51,348
children I can't even stand on their own

613
00:25:50,509 --> 00:25:54,348

Gordon Smith and sheriff Noel when they

617
00:26:00,108 --> 00:26:05,808

news conference that we were who we

620
00:26:07,848 --> 00:26:11,569
opposed him and the TV thing he said

621
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:14,960
that if you get a marijuana petition

622

00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:37,009

00:27:37,009 --> 00:27:44,420
that's how you know anybody you know who

659
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:45,860

660
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:47,480

661
00:27:45,859 --> 00:27:49,549

662
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:51,110

them 24 hours a day

664
00:27:51,109 --> 00:27:54,500
