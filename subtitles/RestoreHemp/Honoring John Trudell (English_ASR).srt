1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:03,159
we're glad that Mr Robertson from the

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:06,160
vice president's office thinks that we

3
00:00:03,158 --> 00:00:08,000
have proved our Point uh it's to us when

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,120
we know we've proved our Point

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,080
well we've proved the point that Mr

6
00:00:10,119 --> 00:00:14,798
Robertson would like to have

7
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:17,399
proved but about the things that are

8
00:00:14,798 --> 00:00:20,518
going on about Indian people's socially

9
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:22,118
and economically being below par

10
00:00:20,518 --> 00:00:24,598
compared to the rest of the

11
00:00:22,118 --> 00:00:26,960
population but we've got a bigger Point

12
00:00:24,599 --> 00:00:28,640
than that we're saying uh we're talking

13
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,359
about law we're talking about respect as

14
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,878
a people respecting a people as a people

15
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:36,239
we're talking about about more than

16
00:00:33,878 --> 00:00:38,119
poverty we're talking about honor we're

17
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:40,679
saying you've never dealt with us

18
00:00:38,119 --> 00:00:41,919
honorably United States uh ever and it's

19
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:43,679
time that you start doing so because

20
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,719
we're not going to we're not going to

21
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:47,359
allow it to continue we can't Mr

22
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:48,840
Robertson's point was that all the

23
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:50,920
problems for the Indian people such as

24
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,480
you just mentioned are in the cities on

25
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:54,079
the mainland and therefore you were not

26
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:56,519
helping these problems by staying out on

27
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,198
the island do you agree with that no

28
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,239
problems for the Indian people are

29
00:00:58,198 --> 00:01:03,118
within the United States government

30
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:05,719
problems are problems that we're having

31
00:01:03,118 --> 00:01:07,759
is is the noqual fishing battle in at

32
00:01:05,719 --> 00:01:09,560
Frank's Landing in Washington where the

33
00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:10,519
treaty is being broken the federal

34
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,960
government is allowing the state

35
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:13,239
government to break a treaty that was

36
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:14,478
signed between the Indians and the

37
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:16,039
Indian people and the federal government

38
00:01:14,478 --> 00:01:18,200
that treaty is a law we're talking about

39
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:21,520
things like this we're talking

40
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,920
about about that we if we're free we

41
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:24,239
want the right to make our own decisions

42
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,799
we don't want the great white father

43
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:27,920
image anymore looking down on us making

44
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:29,479
the decision for us and this Mr

45
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,118
Robertson or President Nixon came out

46
00:01:29,478 --> 00:01:33,280
with this proposal uh that he gave to

47
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:35,239
Congress the nstep plan and he talks in

48
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,840
there about ending paternalism he

49
00:01:35,239 --> 00:01:38,959
created that he didn't end any

50
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,600
paternalism with that that bill well Mr

51
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:42,599
trudel President Nixon says that he

52
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:44,199
feels particularly close to Indians

53
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:46,519
because his football coach who was also

54
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:48,200
his first campaign manager is an Indian

55
00:01:46,519 --> 00:01:50,078
do you think he is particularly close to

56
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:52,478
the Indians I think Mr Nixon is probably

57
00:01:50,078 --> 00:01:53,718
particularly close to Mr Nixon uh and

58
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:54,959
we're concerned about people the

59
00:01:53,718 --> 00:01:57,118
reservation people the people on the

60
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:58,559
reservations that that are being forced

61
00:01:57,118 --> 00:01:59,920
to assimilate or die out we're worried

62
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,719
about things like our language and our

63
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,879
culture and we want this on our own

64
00:02:01,718 --> 00:02:04,798
terms we don't want it we don't want to

65
00:02:03,879 --> 00:02:06,118
be able to hang on to it because the

66
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,159
federal government says we can keep this

67
00:02:06,118 --> 00:02:10,239
much and we can keep that much it's part

68
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:12,359
of us and we want it

69
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,239
all it's what we're accomplishing by

70
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,599
here is alcatra has never sold out the

71
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,519
government offered us money for the

72
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:18,878
island which went through these these

73
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:20,439
current negotiations starting April the

74
00:02:18,878 --> 00:02:22,639
13th they offered us money and we told

75
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:24,359
them no they offered us a lease we told

76
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:25,598
them no we said we want to talk about

77
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,480
when you're going to turn the deed over

78
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:28,719
to us the one thing the significant

79
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:30,479
thing has been accomplished by alcatra

80
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:32,280
is whether we want the physical part of

81
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:34,199
the island or not we never sold

82
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,239
ourselves out we never compromised we

83
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:38,199
went for the whole cup of cake and if we

84
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,200
don't get it we're bringing people to

85
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:41,679
our side cuz there's a lot of Indians

86
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:45,199
aren't going to like this is it true

87
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,280
John that de defeat no man there is no

88
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:48,719
such thing as

89
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:50,318
defeat you know when when they start

90
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:53,318
kicking you around you know you just got

91
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:55,919
to learn to bandage up the bruises see

92
00:02:53,318 --> 00:02:58,839
stand up again they didn't beat

93
00:02:55,919 --> 00:03:00,280
us here's the deal is like I think the

94
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,959
one important thing that comes out of

95
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,959
this is that the government gave us

96
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:06,158
their word through their negotiators

97
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:07,400
that nothing would happen and they came

98
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:09,439
out there and they took our people off

99
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,799
the island and all this is going to

100
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:12,359
narrow down for our own Indian people

101
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:13,599
this is going to benefit Indian people

102
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,159
throughout the country because here's

103
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:17,158
the thing is like Indians know whose

104
00:03:15,158 --> 00:03:18,840
side the government's on the government

105
00:03:17,158 --> 00:03:21,560
don't lie to you and then go out and do

106
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:24,158
something against you have any doubt as

107
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:26,360
to who was on their side before this

108
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:27,519
well we have see like all right every

109
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:29,040
day you got to you got to do a little

110
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,480
something to get a little people on your

111
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:32,359
side now we've got Indian people that

112
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:33,639
know that they've got they've got their

113
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,560
questions or dislikes against the

114
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:36,000
government but when they see the

115
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,080
government come out and commit actions

116
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,479
like this against us the government is

117
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,799
talking about honor in Vietnam and it

118
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:41,798
comes out here and lies to Indian just

119
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,239
because we're Indians that don't mean

120
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:46,920
they lie to us kind of had to find us a

121
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:49,719
new place to live so we figured this

122
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:52,318
would be as good a spot as any it's it's

123
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:55,280
a military base belongs to federal

124
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:58,719
government they say they're not using it

125
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:01,598
we could use it we need it so we're here

126
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:03,239
we've uh

127
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:04,399
we're pretty uh to put it mildly we're

128
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:06,920
pretty upset about the way the

129
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,959
government handled the alcatra situation

130
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:10,518
you expect the that people will will

131
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,840
come here and will live and you attempt

132
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:13,840
to make it a community or is it a is it

133
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:17,840
is it a

134
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:20,160
gesture of defines of the

135
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:23,478
government I think

136
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,880
uh I think they're both the same you get

137
00:04:23,478 --> 00:04:26,918
you it seems like when you get Indian

138
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:29,120
people together now and we just want to

139
00:04:26,918 --> 00:04:30,680
live that's defying that's defying to

140
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,759
the government already they don't they

141
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:34,680
can't understand that see what we want

142
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:37,000
is like really it just boils down too

143
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:38,439
basically we want to be left alone we

144
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,839
want to be left alone but we want the

145
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:42,719
right to

146
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:44,079
uh to guide our own lives you know we

147
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,960
don't believe in the great white father

148
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:49,240
we think that uh you know it's a myth

149
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:49,239
the dude's dead you know he never

150
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:55,280
existed if you don't agree with the

151
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,680
federal government's Chain of Thought or

152
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:58,638
if you don't agree with what they tell

153
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:00,600
you you should agree with then they

154
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:04,439
react against it they they react against

155
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:06,960
it very harshly you know this is uh the

156
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:08,719
way they they bring in all these armed

157
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:11,000
people to alcatra and they knew we were

158
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,759
unarmed out there uh they did it at

159
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,319
People's Park or a of Vista when people

160
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,240
stand up for their rights they have a

161
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:19,719
tendency to react you know to show you

162
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:20,680
their strength and when they show you

163
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,880
their strength they're always showing

164
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:24,959
you how many guns they've got you know

165
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:26,600
put it this way uh if criminals are

166
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:28,799
supposed to be in jail you guys can take

167
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:30,560
that for what it's worth whoever put the

168
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,280
names there me it

169
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,600
you know there's there's more than one

170
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:35,638
kind of criminal more than a street

171
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,680
criminal you know Street Criminal Just

172
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:39,560
reacts to what the other criminals

173
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,519
create for him because of some trouble

174
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:43,160
over some copper wire they had an excuse

175
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:45,478
to get you off alcatra what kind of

176
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:47,520
excuse will they have to move you from

177
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:50,000
here I don't know I don't think they'll

178
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:52,198
have any excuses to move us from here

179
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,560
and as far as their copper wire excuse

180
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:56,680
that we were stealing you know that's a

181
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,319
whole long story number one is that uh

182
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:00,120
they knew that we were taking the Copper

183
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:02,080
from the island they've no one for over

184
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:04,560
a year you know now how come all of a

185
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:07,159
sudden they're all panicky about it and

186
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,519
the vandalism that we did to the island

187
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:12,919
you know supposedly did that they're

188
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:15,758
charging us with well you know let let's

189
00:06:12,918 --> 00:06:17,719
think back about 400 years when the

190
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:20,759
Europeans came over here they came over

191
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:23,120
here and they discovered this this this

192
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:25,280
main body of land here and in the

193
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,120
process of discovering they tapped the

194
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:29,758
land and they took the natural resources

195
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,720
for their own use they committed did

196
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:33,879
vandalist acts against the land because

197
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:36,400
look at look at the environment that's

198
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:38,079
vandalism so on Alcatraz we've done the

199
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:39,638
same thing basically we did it on a

200
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:41,199
smaller scale I guess we tapped the

201
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:43,079
natural resources which happened to be

202
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:45,560
copper that was that Island's natural

203
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:47,079
resources for the time we discovered the

204
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:49,478
island we were claiming it for our own

205
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:52,240
so we took it for our own use you know

206
00:06:49,478 --> 00:06:54,639
so uh if we're if we're Crooks for

207
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,918
stealing that copper then who's Crooks

208
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:59,120
for stealing this over here you know it

209
00:06:56,918 --> 00:07:01,198
just uh so if they're going to go like

210
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,000
that we're both both Crooks but to what

211
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,639
degree who's the biggest crook of all

212
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,199
how do you how do you think everybody's

213
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:09,280
feeling about the temporariness of their

214
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:11,840
situation is that is that bothering

215
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:13,119
people does it bother you no it doesn't

216
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:15,918
bother me I don't think it bothers

217
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:18,160
anyone else uh alcatra was 19 months of

218
00:07:15,918 --> 00:07:21,799
temporariness you know we're used to it

219
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:24,039
it's uh I think in a way Indian lives

220
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:26,520
now the whole Indian way of life has

221
00:07:24,038 --> 00:07:28,360
been built on temporariness boarding

222
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:30,079
school system you you're temporarily

223
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:31,400
there you're temporarily at home you're

224
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:33,240
temporarily in the joint you're

225
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:35,079
temporarily on the street you're always

226
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:37,560
temporarily somewhere and permanently

227
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:39,359
nowhere ever permanently just having to

228
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:41,160
hassle you know the only thing we have

229
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,280
that's permanent is our reservation

230
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:45,479
land but we're always in a temporary

231
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:47,918
situation on our own land so you know

232
00:07:45,478 --> 00:07:49,639
it's nothing new so being so

233
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:52,918
disorganized with no furniture isn't

234
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:54,439
putting anybody up tight oh no you know

235
00:07:52,918 --> 00:07:57,158
like last night at midnight the place

236
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:58,680
was completely quiet people were used to

237
00:07:57,158 --> 00:08:00,639
it man we come in yesterday morning at

238
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:02,720
4:00

239
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:05,319
by by 8:00 last night everyone had

240
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,599
houses and just drifted right into

241
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:09,960
living you know you live like that you

242
00:08:07,598 --> 00:08:12,079
know you live when you can and but it's

243
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:14,079
no big hassle it's nothing that exciting

244
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:16,079
you know just uh for us it's just a way

245
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:18,719
of life just doing it you're not getting

246
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:22,240
tired it's been a long year for

247
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,639
you no it's uh start to get tired and

248
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,319
then the government comes out there and

249
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:26,759
they get cute and then that that just

250
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:29,680
kind of takes the tiredness and just

251
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:30,879
washes it away you know because uh

252
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,240
because the government's there and they

253
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:35,200
do what they do so it isn't isn't enough

254
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:37,479
time to really get tired it's something

255
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,839
to keep you going you know it's better I

256
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:40,440
think we would be more tired if we just

257
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:42,479
had to lay around and not be able to do

258
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:44,440
nothing at all you know R if you if you

259
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,959
had your choice what the outcome what

260
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:50,000
what would be your most pleasurable

261
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:51,679
outcome get an honorable government that

262
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,879
would be it cuz when you got an

263
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:54,759
honorable government then you don't have

264
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:56,399
to worry about these other hassold you

265
00:08:54,759 --> 00:08:58,439
know honorable people will sit down and

266
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:02,000
talk and try and work out a

267
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:04,040
solution but uh sure government people

268
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,879
out there now what do you expect before

269
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:08,599
they came like 400 years of prison was

270
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:11,399
pretty heavy sure it was you know it's

271
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:12,879
uh 400 years of prison like the Island's

272
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:14,679
always been misused you know the only

273
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:18,639
time that Islands had any Liberation is

274
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:20,599
when we were out there you know uh

275
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:22,319
besides what all this propaganda that

276
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:24,519
the government is running down about how

277
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:27,640
we how filthy we were and what kind of

278
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:29,039
vandals we were you know let we had that

279
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:30,480
Island liberated people were free to

280
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:32,278
move around out there and all of a

281
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,639
sudden reporters even reporters sensed

282
00:09:32,278 --> 00:09:36,679
that when they went out there they never

283
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:39,600
talked about bad vibes fact existed we

284
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:41,799
held elcat for 19 months against the

285
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,600
United States government and we did it

286
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:45,799
on our own we did it our own way we were

287
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,519
never co-opted they tried to offer US

288
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:48,879
money we said we don't want your money

289
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,639
they tried to offer us a lease we said

290
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:52,399
we don't want your leases we want this

291
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:54,879
for our own for us to build it and make

292
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:57,440
it either make it last or fall but we

293
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:59,600
want it to do it on our own we already

294
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,880
know that we're equal I mean we're equal

295
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:04,399
as human beings so we're not fighting

296
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:07,519
for equality but we're fighting for is

297
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:11,000
we want Economic Opportunity we want the

298
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:13,078
right to control our own economic base

299
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
you know and we want the right to to

300
00:10:13,078 --> 00:10:16,319
control Our Lives it was worth it in the

301
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,799
sense here of like there are more

302
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,200
Indians now that have gotten out of

303
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:22,199
being

304
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:24,320
apathetic and they did they did that

305
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:26,440
because of things like alcatra Alcatraz

306
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,480
happened after Alcatraz happened Fort

307
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:29,839
lton happened the Black Hills movement

308
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,399
happened it's happening on on the East

309
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:34,800
Coast it's there there's a a Revival of

310
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,159
of building Indian Pride I'm proud of

311
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:39,439
being Indian and I'm going to stand up

312
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:39,439
to the United States government to prove

313
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,278
it for
