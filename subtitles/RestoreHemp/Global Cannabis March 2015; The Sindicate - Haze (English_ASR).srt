10
00:00:14,558 --> 00:00:18,160
with the joint in hand just passing it

won't you light up in place

14
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:53,079
lost in her purple hands

15
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,640
life's just a masquerade

16
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:03,159
time slowly slips

17
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,640
um

18
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:32,000
she almost made it she was so

19
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,000
consecutive now she lies in the valley

20
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:37,759
just waiting for her heart to stop us

21
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:41,240
beating for the devil to take her soul

22
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,239
the good is

23
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:55,319
and when i'm stopping if your teeth

24
00:01:51,438 --> 00:01:55,319
should let me bleed

25
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,399
is

26
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:15,719
once you light up in place

27
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,080
time slowly slips

28
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:16,199
is

29
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,799
