business Alliance for Commerce and hemp

33
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,799
was formed um couple of years ago by a

34
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:22,040
group of investors and business people

35
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:23,680
and activists uh who are concerned oh

36
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:26,320
and researchers who are concerned about

37
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,840
the current trend of uh American

38
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:30,959
politics not only in terms of the

39
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:32,600
suppression of of civil liberties

40
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:35,199
involved with the marijuana movement of

41
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:36,879
course but with the suppression of the

42
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,118
economic Alternatives that are available

43
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:40,519
by developing hemp and uh we have

44
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:44,280
basically four goals that we're working

45
00:01:40,519 --> 00:01:46,399
for the first is the uh deregulation of

46
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,680
commercial non-smoking uses of hemp for

47
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,718
things like paper fiber fuel food things

48
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:52,719
like this uh the second is to restore

49
00:01:50,718 --> 00:01:56,798
the medicinal use and availability of

50
00:01:52,718 --> 00:02:00,718
hemp as a medicine or as an herbal user

51
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:02,399
uh and the next is to to get back to

52
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:04,599
restore the civil liberties the freedom

53
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,000
of choice of the individual in terms of

54
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:08,439
what they Garden or what they choose to

55
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
consume in their Leisure Time and the

56
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:14,439
final one is to develop a system of

57
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,239
outlets and um other kinds of ways of

58
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:19,079
handling a uh domestic hemp industry

59
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:20,759
that would be for consuming consumption

60
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,040
through smoking and so forth something

61
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:23,919
along the lines of the wine industry

62
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:25,878
where the individual can grow it or

63
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:27,318
could also be used yeah isn't I don't

64
00:02:25,878 --> 00:02:29,318
know I've always gotten the impression

65
00:02:27,318 --> 00:02:30,359
that this movement is primarily an

66
00:02:29,318 --> 00:02:31,639
organization

67
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,760
trying to get a bunch of old hippies

68
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:34,518
together so they can get out there and

69
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:36,679
legalize marijuana so they can smoke the

70
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:38,319
brains out you know and what you're

71
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:40,480
saying is is a little different than

72
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:41,878
that one thing is that if if there were

73
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:42,959
a bunch of old hippies who got together

74
00:02:41,878 --> 00:02:45,000
and went out in the fields where they're

75
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,200
growing commercial industrial hemp

76
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,239
they're not going to get the smoke their

77
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:50,479
brains out because it's going to be uh

78
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,080
that contains so little THC that it

79
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:53,759
wouldn't be good as a psychoactive

80
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,959
substance or as an intoxicant or however

81
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:57,318
you want to refer to it it's a

82
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,878
relaxational why is it that why why do

83
00:02:57,318 --> 00:03:00,958
you mean by that is it a different kind

84
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:03,199
of of hemp plant that that then once you

85
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,878
get high with no it's still a cannabis

86
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:06,759
plant uh cannabis is of course a

87
00:03:04,878 --> 00:03:09,120
scientific name for it hemp is the

88
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:11,759
American or English name for the plant

89
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,239
uh marijuana is just a expression that

90
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:14,919
William Randolph HST picked up from

91
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:16,759
Mexico and uh in fact they don't even

92
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:19,679
use it in Mexico they call it Mota down

93
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:21,959
there or kamo but marijuana was just

94
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,040
like a this a slang word that we use

95
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:25,759
nowadays but it is the same plant it's

96
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:27,318
just a matter of how you cultivate it if

97
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:29,318
you were growing it very densely

98
00:03:27,318 --> 00:03:31,318
together you get a lot of stem a little

99
00:03:29,318 --> 00:03:32,839
bit of leaf very little THC if you

100
00:03:31,318 --> 00:03:34,238
spread it out more you'll get more of

101
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,920
the branching and flowers and that's

102
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:38,799
where your THC is but is it Rel

103
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:40,479
legalizing uh sending a wrong message to

104
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,480
kids especially we're saying all right

105
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:44,759
dudes go out there get high part of your

106
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:47,598
brains out we don't care it sounds like

107
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:48,878
it's sending a wrong message to me well

108
00:03:47,598 --> 00:03:50,079
first off prohibition isn't really about

109
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:51,919
sending messages it's about sending

110
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,920
people to jail and there's a big

111
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:56,318
difference between these two things if

112
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:58,000
we're not saying that uh for example

113
00:03:56,318 --> 00:03:59,878
tobacco and alcohol these are things

114
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,239
that we don't condone as a society as

115
00:03:59,878 --> 00:04:03,158
such but we do allow people to have that

116
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:04,680
freedom of choice especially adults it's

117
00:04:03,158 --> 00:04:06,959
a way of simulating the difference

118
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,040
between a a child and adult is that when

119
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,680
you reach a certain age where you can

120
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:11,280
consume alcohol and tobacco that's

121
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,599
considered toys of the adult so to speak

122
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,598
and so marijuana will be played

123
00:04:12,598 --> 00:04:16,759
similarly in a category like that yeah

124
00:04:14,598 --> 00:04:19,159
but won't kids have easier access to it

125
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:21,040
if you Legalize It Well I would say

126
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,759
actually less so there are two reasons

127
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:26,040
for this one is because when we see

128
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:27,479
countries like um the Netherlands or uh

129
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,879
Spain and countries where they have

130
00:04:27,478 --> 00:04:32,120
legalized marijuana for private use they

131
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:34,159
find that actually the youth goes down

132
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,639
it hits a stable level in society and

133
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,479
part of that is because the Mystique of

134
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:39,240
doing something illegal is taken away

135
00:04:37,478 --> 00:04:42,038
the other thing is that if it's being

136
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,680
vended by someone who is a distributor

137
00:04:42,038 --> 00:04:45,079
who has a license on the line and pays

138
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,038
fees and they know if they sell it to

139
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:47,319
children that they're going to lose

140
00:04:46,038 --> 00:04:49,079
their license and and their

141
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:50,478
distributorship they're not going to do

142
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:53,038
it whereas if it's in the hands of

143
00:04:50,478 --> 00:04:54,918
criminals who are attempting to make

144
00:04:53,038 --> 00:04:56,800
money by whatever hooker by crook they

145
00:04:54,918 --> 00:04:58,519
can do it they don't care who buys it

146
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,478
yeah but we know that that marijuana is

147
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:02,240
a gateway drug and that leads to other

148
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:04,120
drugs then it leads to more damaging

149
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,160
effects it leads to all kinds of

150
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,879
problems if nothing else it leads to

151
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,360
lack of motivation which then you have

152
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:12,759
people not wanting to work and therefore

153
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,360
you even hurt the economy I mean I don't

154
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:15,759
get it well the National Education

155
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,319
Association and the National Academy of

156
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,600
Sciences both say that tobacco is the

157
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:21,038
gateway drug uh virtually everyone who

158
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,600
smokes marijuana has already

159
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:24,120
experimented with tobacco and with

160
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,120
alcohol by the time they get there if

161
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,199
you want to look at in terms of

162
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,439
addictive psychoactive substances most

163
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,720
people start off with sugar and

164
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:32,279
chocolate then they move on to Tobacco

165
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,120
then they go to alcohol then they start

166
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:35,839
making smoking marijuana by then they're

167
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:37,879
halfway into this pattern the problem is

168
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:40,719
a pattern of behavior of abusive

169
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:42,478
dependency uh that that's where the

170
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,600
problem is not whether they smoked

171
00:05:42,478 --> 00:05:46,560
marijuana or not yeah but you know sugar

172
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:48,800
is not as as bad for you a smoking

173
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,478
marijuana is well sugar RS your teeth

174
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,639
and smoking marijuana doesn't I mean

175
00:05:50,478 --> 00:05:53,519
right off the that there's an obvious

176
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:55,478
difference but they say that you know

177
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:57,279
lung cancer it makes you sterile it's a

178
00:05:55,478 --> 00:05:58,639
very dangerous thing they say

179
00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:01,599
unfortunately we have to deal with a lot

180
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,960
of um false studies right now there's a

181
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,879
lot of bad information that's being

182
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:07,799
pushed around as if it were true uh for

183
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:09,959
example the lung studies uh 250,000 or

184
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:13,000
so people a year die from alcoh I mean

185
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:14,560
from tobacc related uh lung problems not

186
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,478
one person in history has ever died from

187
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,280
smoking marijuana and yet the government

188
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:20,120
tries to tell us that marijuana is 50

189
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:21,799
times more dangerous but how just

190
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,439
obviously doesn't make sense the brain

191
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,280
damage thing had to do with killing some

192
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:26,800
monkeys that they suffocated the monkeys

193
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:28,000
and they found they had brain damage the

194
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,439
fact that they use marijuana smoke to

195
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,478
suffocate them if they had done the same

196
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:33,038
thing with a plastic bag they would have

197
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:35,199
found the same effect these studies are

198
00:06:33,038 --> 00:06:36,879
not scientifically valid they don't have

199
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,919
uh control groups they don't have

200
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:40,319
replicatable evidence to support what

201
00:06:38,918 --> 00:06:41,680
they're saying they're really not true

202
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,720
they're discredited the only reason that

203
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,280
these are even toted around right now is

204
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:47,160
the fact that the DEA and groups like

205
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:49,038
The partnership for a drug-free America

206
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:51,360
which is uh you see their ads on TV a

207
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:52,719
lot uh saying you know that marijuana is

208
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,919
this or that now you notice they don't

209
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,160
say anything bad about alcohol or

210
00:06:53,918 --> 00:06:56,878
tobacco even though these are the most

211
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:58,639
abused drugs in our society the reason

212
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:00,120
for that is because something around 60%

213
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:01,400
of their funding appear to be coming

214
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,399
from groups like Philip Morris who have

215
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:05,679
a vested interest in alcohol and tobacco

216
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:07,399
so they they gain by saying that

217
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,120
marijuana is bad because you're talking

218
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:13,839
about the Gateway effect what what um

219
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:14,959
social behaviorist call uh the real

220
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:16,399
phenomenon there is called drug

221
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:18,318
switching which is that people who tend

222
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:20,519
to take one substance or another that

223
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,919
they'll use one and when they use one

224
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:23,279
that they don't use the other one as

225
00:07:21,918 --> 00:07:25,359
much and what happened in the 60s and

226
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:27,119
the 70s is that as marijuana became more

227
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,280
popular consumption of alcohol and

228
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,918
tobacco went down and so these companies

229
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:32,719
that are selling these products are now

230
00:07:30,918 --> 00:07:34,439
saying all these things putting out

231
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,639
these false reports about health damage

232
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:38,800
from marijuana okay now you got all

233
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:41,598
these wonderful facts and statistics but

234
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:44,000
you cannot ignore the fact that Alaska

235
00:07:41,598 --> 00:07:47,000
after 15 years of having marijuana

236
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,279
legalized right turned it around and and

237
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
made it a crime again to possess it

238
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:55,359
California has had 17 attempts to

239
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:58,598
legalize with initiatives they H plant

240
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:01,479
and they've all failed you know I mean

241
00:07:58,598 --> 00:08:03,199
with the political climate as it is how

242
00:08:01,478 --> 00:08:05,279
come how come you're out here pushing it

243
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:07,000
like this what makes you think someone's

244
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:09,918
actually going to sit there and go okay

245
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,959
this is true let me see the deal well no

246
00:08:09,918 --> 00:08:12,560
one said it was going to be an easy

247
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:14,079
process these are politically difficult

248
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,560
times because there's a tendency towards

249
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:18,719
repression on the part of our government

250
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:21,560
that they uh have the Hardline approach

251
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,319
to a lot of things however the fact that

252
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,800
for 17 years people have been trying to

253
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:27,560
get it legalized here by the initiative

254
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:30,360
process in California well what is a

255
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:32,120
crime and what is a uh a habit I guess

256
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,360
is a question there a personal choice

257
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,959
because you don't see murderers out

258
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,440
there organizing to get murder legalized

259
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:38,679
or thieves out there organizing to get

260
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:40,719
theft legalized criminal acts we don't

261
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:42,199
have political groups working for the

262
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,278
legalization in the case of marijuana

263
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,720
the fact that so many people are working

264
00:08:43,278 --> 00:08:46,480
for it shows you that this is a

265
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,480
political issue as far as the

266
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,839
immovability of government there are two

267
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,039
things on that one is that maybe we've

268
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,320
been using the wrong approach maybe

269
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:54,519
initiatives are not the answer maybe

270
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,600
they are but maybe they're not what is

271
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:58,039
more likely is that we should go through

272
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,839
approaching the deregulation process

273
00:08:58,039 --> 00:09:00,919
which would be a step-by-step process of

274
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:03,200
as we say first the commercial

275
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:05,319
non-smoking uses then the medicinal uses

276
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:09,278
then the private consumption and finally

277
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:11,640
uh a an industry of but what happened in

278
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:12,919
Eastern Europe is very examp is a good

279
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:14,480
example of what can happen the pressure

280
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:15,799
bills and bills when the change comes it

281
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,519
comes very fast I think we're talking

282
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:19,399
about A Change Is could could be as soon

283
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:21,039
as one year could be as far away as five

284
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:23,120
years but look how it took one month for

285
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:24,519
the Berlin Wall to come down now that

286
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,399
Society was much more repressive than

287
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:27,480
what we're going through here with

288
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:31,278
prohibition that's true and so now we

289
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:33,920
have here um some items right made of

290
00:09:31,278 --> 00:09:35,399
him is this true right there's different

291
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:36,719
um I'd like to get a chance to go over

292
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:40,759
those in the second half of the show if

293
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:42,040
at all possible and um I'm very

294
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:43,439
impressed with some of the some of the

295
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:45,039
things you've had to say I mean you've

296
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,160
been very enlightening and I'm sure that

297
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:50,599
the second half will be just as

298
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:50,600
informative but

299
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:58,959
um what I feel now is an unusual uh

300
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,600
approach to the topic is is business as

301
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:02,439
you've taking it you felt that it's

302
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,440
going to be a million dooll industry

303
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:06,440
it's going to be a million dooll job

304
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:09,000
maker open all kinds of jobs for

305
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:11,079
different people is that true well yeah

306
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,759
it really is true I I think that

307
00:10:11,078 --> 00:10:14,078
something that we should uh consider at

308
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:18,600
this point though is that like we have

309
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:20,239
here an example of a of a hand plant now

310
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,800
most people's awareness of it is limited

311
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,360
to this area right here the leaf area

312
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:26,039
which is frequently called marijuana now

313
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:28,000
the actually the most valuable part of

314
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:30,759
the plant is not this which of course

315
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,919
generates 43 $1 billion dollar a year in

316
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:35,039
the United States which is that much

317
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:36,639
earned by Americans cultivating it for

318
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:38,519
marijuana selling it to other Americans

319
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:40,440
legally that's correct in the illegal

320
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:41,320
State uh it's selling marijuana right

321
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:45,760
now is selling for something in the

322
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:47,560
neighborhood of uh $2 to $400 an ounce

323
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:50,399
um if it was legalized it would be

324
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:52,039
talking about this probably being $100 a

325
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,320
pound that people would be paying for

326
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:54,838
the bulk areas and then there would be

327
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,480
your connoisseur grad and so forth so

328
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:58,519
there'll be a wide variety but it's

329
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,360
misleading to deal strictly on the

330
00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:01,799
economics of this part of the plant

331
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,600
because the real value is going to be in

332
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:05,719
this part right here the stem which

333
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:09,159
contains a large percentage of cellulose

334
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:10,720
it includes uh fiber and it can uh also

335
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:12,600
the roots of the plant are important

336
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,278
because they're a part of conservation

337
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,800
programs they can be used to like anchor

338
00:11:14,278 --> 00:11:18,078
soil for example in California we used

339
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:19,559
to have a program to prevent mudslides

340
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:20,679
that they would plant hemp on hillsides

341
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:23,319
that were threatened during rainy

342
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:24,638
Seasons okay now we still have the same

343
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:26,000
problem with the mud slides on the hill

344
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:27,440
but we can't grow hemp on the hillside

345
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,799
to hold it in place and the reason for

346
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,200
that is because hemp can grow up to 20

347
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:33,159
to 30 feet within one growing season it

348
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,480
puts out approximately as about as much

349
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:37,159
root underground as it puts plant above

350
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:39,399
ground and so it puts down extremely

351
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:40,559
strong anchoring roots that are not only

352
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:43,240
do they prevent the erosion but they

353
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:46,638
actually enrich the soil wow no I never

354
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:48,079
would have been aware of that oh well

355
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:50,079
okay so I can see some of your

356
00:11:48,078 --> 00:11:51,919
viewpoints but still you know the

357
00:11:50,078 --> 00:11:53,039
creating of the jobs now you got to take

358
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:54,799
in consideration there's going to be

359
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:56,159
some jobs lost too like the loggers who

360
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:58,359
are cutting down the trees cuz you talk

361
00:11:56,159 --> 00:11:59,319
about doing it for paper right right

362
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,320
what are you going to do about those

363
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:02,760
people well you going to put them on

364
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,200
welfare well when the automobile was

365
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:06,278
invented and people stopped using

366
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:08,160
buggies then the buggy drivers had to go

367
00:12:06,278 --> 00:12:09,799
out of business and the people who made

368
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:11,078
buggies went out of business and what

369
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:12,838
happened was the society made a

370
00:12:11,078 --> 00:12:15,599
transition into what we consider now as

371
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:17,920
the modern era where people learned how

372
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,399
to drive cars the buggy drivers learned

373
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:21,599
other trades the companies that had been

374
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,320
making the buggies start to make

375
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,959
Automobiles and so forth it's simply

376
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:27,800
matter of transition societ we can't be

377
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:29,559
anchored onto this uh basically suicidal

378
00:12:27,799 --> 00:12:31,759
system that we have nowadays which is

379
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:35,479
based upon petrochemicals and poisonous

380
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:38,159
uh substances wow well learning here is

381
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:40,360
quite a bit of a experience I must say

382
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:41,799
and uh as I said earlier we have a

383
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,320
public service announcement I'd like to

384
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:45,679
bring to you from the United States

385
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:47,959
Department of Agriculture we find this

386
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:51,198
to be a very interesting approach from

387
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:52,799
our government for our farmers and uh I

388
00:12:51,198 --> 00:12:54,919
think this is their way of letting the

389
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:57,599
world know exactly where they stand at

390
00:12:54,919 --> 00:13:00,879
least back in 1942 when they originally

391
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:03,000
released this during uh World War II to

392
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:06,559
help with the uh war effort should we

393
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:09,779
say so I hope you enjoy it and when we

394
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:29,268
come back spend more time with Chris

397
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,639
long ago when these ancient Grecian

398
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:40,480
temples were new hemp was already old in

399
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:44,039
the service of

400
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:46,159
mankind for thousands of years even then

401
00:13:44,039 --> 00:13:48,559
this plant had been grown for cordage

402
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:50,480
and coarse cloth in China and elsewhere

403
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:54,439
in the

404
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:55,959
East for centuries prior to about 1850

405
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:58,040
all the ships that sailed the Western

406
00:13:55,958 --> 00:14:00,958
Seas were rigged with hemp and rope and

407
00:13:58,039 --> 00:14:04,519
sails for the Sailor no less than the

408
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:04,518
hangman hemp was

409
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:13,680
indispensable a 44 gun frigate like our

410
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:16,240
cherished o iron sides took over 60 tons

411
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:16,239
of hemp for

412
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:24,680
rigging including an anchor cable 25 in

413
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,679
in circumference

414
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:35,480
the conastoga wagons and pris Schooners

415
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:38,198
of pioneer days were covered with hempen

416
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:41,399
canvas indeed the very word canvas comes

417
00:14:38,198 --> 00:14:41,399
from the Arabic word for

418
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:48,919
hemp in those days hemp was an important

419
00:14:45,799 --> 00:14:48,919
crop in Kentucky and

420
00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:55,519
Missouri then came cheaper imported

421
00:14:52,198 --> 00:14:57,799
fibers for cordage like jute Cil and

422
00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:00,679
Manila hemp and the culture of hemp in

423
00:14:57,799 --> 00:15:02,599
America declined

424
00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:04,120
but now with Philippine and East Indian

425
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:06,759
sources of hemp in the hands of the

426
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:09,159
Japanese and shipment of Juke from India

427
00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:11,519
curtailed American hemp must meet the

428
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:15,078
needs of our Army and Navy as well as of

429
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:16,959
our Industries in 1942 patriotic farmers

430
00:15:15,078 --> 00:15:19,838
at the government's request planted

431
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:23,879
36,000 Acres of seed hemp an increase of

432
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:26,360
several th% the goal for 1943 is 50,000

433
00:15:23,879 --> 00:15:29,039
Acres of seed

434
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:31,159
hemp in Kentucky much of the seed hemp

435
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:34,000
acreage is on River Bottom land such as

436
00:15:31,159 --> 00:15:35,919
this along the Kentucky River Gorge some

437
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,078
of these fields are inaccessible except

by

439

boat thus plans are a foot for a great

440
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:44,680
expansion of the hemp industry as a part

441
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,278
of the war program this film is designed

to tell Farmers how to handle this

443

ancient crop now little known outside

444

Kentucky and

445
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:56,199
Wisconsin this is hemp seed be careful

446
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:58,120
how you use it for to grow hemp legally

447
00:15:56,198 --> 00:15:59,719
you must have a federal registration and

448
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:02,519
tax stamp

449
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:04,800
this is provided for in your contract

450
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:08,039
ask your AAA committee man or your

451
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:10,799
county agent about it don't

452
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:12,519
forget hemp Demands a rich well- drained

453
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:14,599
soil such as is found here in the

[Music]

457
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:28,079
Wisconsin it must be loose and rich in

organic matter poor soils won't do

459
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:33,519
soil that will grow good corn will

460
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:36,519
usually grow

461
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:38,039
hemp hemp is not hard on the soil in

462
00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:39,959
Kentucky it has been grown for several

463
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:41,439
years on the same ground though this

464
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:44,479
practice is not

465
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:46,079
recommended a dense and Shady crop hemp

466
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,240
tends to choke out

467
00:16:46,078 --> 00:16:49,519
weeds here's a can of of thistle that

468
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,680
couldn't stand the

469
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:54,198
competition dead is a dodo thus hemp

470
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:55,879
leaves the ground in good condition for

471
00:16:54,198 --> 00:16:58,318
the following

472
00:16:55,879 --> 00:17:00,559
crop for a fiber hemp should be sewn

473
00:16:58,318 --> 00:17:02,719
five Peg to the acre with drill the

474
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:05,679
closer the rows the better these rows

475
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,680
are spaced about 4

476
00:17:06,078 --> 00:17:11,720
in this hemp has been broadcast either

477
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:13,880
way it should be so very interesting I

478
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:16,600
should say I I guess that's exactly

479
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:19,799
where Uncle Sam stands on the topic of

480
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:22,159
hemp and uh my guest Chris Conrad seems

481
00:17:19,798 --> 00:17:24,639
to stand very firmly on it being a very

482
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:27,679
interesting and lucrative way of

483
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:29,480
generating prosperous economy in the

484
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:31,200
United States actually not the way the

485
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:33,200
government stands on hemp this is a

486
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,400
realistic answer to what where the

487
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,000
government should be on hemp where the

488
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,559
government is on hemp is quite different

489
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,400
what they're doing is interfering with a

490
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:40,918
private sector's ability to develop a

491
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,880
very valuable natural resource that

492
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:46,000
could create TR a trillion dollars a

493
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:49,600
year of income for Americans uh produce

494
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,839
tens of thousands of jobs uh 50,000 new

495
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:53,000
products could be brought into the

496
00:17:50,839 --> 00:17:54,199
market or products that were currently

497
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,558
made could be made out of hand to be

498
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:58,200
quan, different products so our current

499
00:17:56,558 --> 00:18:00,558
policy is to repress all that so you

500
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:02,319
said now we have some products here

501
00:18:00,558 --> 00:18:04,839
ready uh right in front of us that you

502
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:07,240
say are made of hemp right right

503
00:18:04,839 --> 00:18:09,199
or would you be gracious enough please

504
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:11,279
to share what you uh brought with us

505
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,720
with our audience sure what we've got

506
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:15,440
here the first thing I should show you

507
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:18,440
is this shirt this is made of uh hemp

508
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:21,120
with a blend with cotton this is a 55%

509
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:24,038
hemp 45% cotton it's that's made of hemp

510
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:25,479
55% hemp correct it last longer it's 26%

511
00:18:24,038 --> 00:18:27,679
more water absorbent it's more

512
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:30,400
insulative uh and it's much stronger

513
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:32,000
than regular cotton would be wow um in

514
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,840
the foreground here I've got three

515
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,759
pieces of paper one of them this is like

516
00:18:34,839 --> 00:18:38,079
a parchment style paper here this is

517
00:18:36,759 --> 00:18:39,640
what your Declaration of Independence

518
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:41,519
and Constitution were originally written

519
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:43,720
on a paper similar to quality of this

520
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:44,960
this is a filtration paper here tea bags

521
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,759
things that you need to have sayfe

522
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,159
strong when it's wet because hemp fiber

523
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:50,558
is strong it doesn't lose that when it's

524
00:18:48,159 --> 00:18:52,480
in water this in the middle is a looks

525
00:18:50,558 --> 00:18:55,000
like a newsprint type of a paper it's a

526
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:57,038
pole Pap of paper and it's made of huh

527
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,798
correct uh did they use this back in the

528
00:18:57,038 --> 00:19:00,640
early days you know like Grand

529
00:18:58,798 --> 00:19:01,960
Constitution time or something yeah well

530
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,080
they didn't use this this is a pulp

531
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:05,960
paper they use more like this the fiber

532
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:10,000
um paper that's and they wrote on it

533
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:11,880
manuscript paper daily right now uh over

534
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,759
here we have some seed this is used as

535
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,960
bird seed right now yeah I get the birds

536
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:17,400
high right yeah it's called Happy Bird

537
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:19,159
actually birds sing better um because

538
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:20,720
when they use it we don't know if it's

539
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:22,159
there's very little THC in there it

540
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,079
seems to be because it moistens their

541
00:19:22,159 --> 00:19:26,200
throat because it has a lot of oil in

542
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:28,759
fact it's 30% oil and right next to it

543
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:30,558
here we have some hair gel this is made

544
00:19:28,759 --> 00:19:33,200
made from hemp oil and it's also got

545
00:19:30,558 --> 00:19:34,678
some herbs in it some of the herbal hemp

546
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,120
in it now moving forward a little

547
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:37,880
further we see some other products that

548
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:43,319
are made from the seed when the seed is

549
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:45,159
crushed it produces uh oils and a uh

550
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:47,439
high protein powder here which is called

551
00:19:45,159 --> 00:19:48,480
CA cake this is more nutritional than

552
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,519
any other thing that we know of

553
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,079
excepting for soya and in terms of

554
00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:54,079
digestibility it's more digestible than

555
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:55,960
soya so it actually uh when you look at

556
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:58,079
parts of the world like um northern

557
00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:00,159
Africa and Bangladesh in these areas

558
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:01,918
where there's a lot M starvation a lot

559
00:20:00,159 --> 00:20:03,240
of that is a result of international

560
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:05,400
laws that are preventing them from

561
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:06,720
growing hemp for uses of food supply

562
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:09,000
which it has been for thousands of years

563
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:11,079
for these count yes exactly the law is

564
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,558
the single convention Treaty of 1961 by

565
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:14,399
the United Nations and you notice that

566
00:20:12,558 --> 00:20:16,918
the big periods of starvation began in

567
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:19,440
the mid 60s late 60s and continue on to

568
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:21,360
today within 10 years of banning hemp

569
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,360
starvation became part of the norm for

570
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:25,439
these parts of the world wow now these

571
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:27,079
two pieces of oil uh I mean samples of

572
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,240
oil this is a raw oil you see it's got a

573
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:31,359
little brownish color similar to the

574
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:33,120
seed itself this on the other hand has

575
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:35,359
been distilled and so it's cleaner

576
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:37,439
looking um you can make anything from

577
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:39,119
machine oil to cooking oil out of these

578
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,840
wow these are all fibers from the plant

579
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:43,000
this is a rather raw fiber this is

580
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:45,158
called a toe line both of these are from

581
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,159
Russian hemp Russian hemp right now this

582
00:20:45,159 --> 00:20:49,720
string here and this rope they're both

583
00:20:47,159 --> 00:20:53,039
from Hungarian hemp this has been made

584
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:54,880
into a bag here through a Mac process

585
00:20:53,038 --> 00:20:57,079
they've wrapped it up here's a PO holder

586
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:59,120
made out of it your balls of twine this

587
00:20:57,079 --> 00:21:00,639
tea bag back in here and and it swings

588
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:02,678
us right back down to the plant from

589
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,960
which all these products can be made wow

590
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:05,519
okay now if you can make all these

591
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,640
things that sounds Grand right but

592
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:08,879
aren't you going to have a problem with

593
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:11,960
like re-educating and retooling the the

594
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:14,120
market for people learning how to work

595
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:16,558
with hemp and construct with me we know

596
00:21:14,119 --> 00:21:18,239
that to loom with cotton you use you

597
00:21:16,558 --> 00:21:20,359
know different type a little bit

598
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,919
different type Loom than you do with

599
00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:23,959
hemp if you're going to have your car

600
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:26,520
running around running on methanol right

601
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:28,159
or is it methane methanol methanol

602
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:29,839
methane would replace natural gas okay

603
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:31,159
methanol then it means you got to turn

604
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:33,480
the whole car over turn the whole

605
00:21:31,159 --> 00:21:35,360
industry over right not really one of

606
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:37,360
the strong points about it is there a

607
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:39,119
big incentive because there's billions

608
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:40,678
and trillions of dollars of profit that

609
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:42,439
can be generated and very little

610
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:44,240
retooling that's actually required for

611
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:46,679
example uh the car needs a conversion

612
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:48,200
unit and then it can run on the methanol

613
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:49,759
um but you wouldn't have to look for

614
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,038
example if you tried to make a hydrogen

615
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:53,839
powered car you're talking about some

616
00:21:51,038 --> 00:21:56,558
major retooling with a methanol powered

617
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:57,959
car it's just a matter of uh of one new

618
00:21:56,558 --> 00:21:59,599
part that needs to be put in to make it

619
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:01,079
more workable any other plants that can

620
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:02,038
make all these things and can do all

621
00:22:01,079 --> 00:22:03,439
these things there are plants that can

622
00:22:02,038 --> 00:22:04,679
be used to do different parts of it but

623
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,320
as far as doing all of them that's

624
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:07,200
another matter um I wanted to get back

625
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:09,278
to the other question about the

626
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,519
retooling though because uh for example

627
00:22:09,278 --> 00:22:12,159
that's why they have the cotton Blended

628
00:22:10,519 --> 00:22:14,319
in with the hemp here because the Looms

629
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:16,559
are set up for a short fiber like cotton

630
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:18,720
uh and hemp has a long fiber and so in

631
00:22:16,558 --> 00:22:20,240
order to make that work all they did was

632
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,360
blend it with the cotton and they'll

633
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,440
still get a lot of the benefits of the

634
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:23,879
hemp but without having to do the

635
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:25,840
retooling that would otherwise have been

636
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:27,679
required you can make the oil for

637
00:22:25,839 --> 00:22:29,720
example is similar in quality to that

638
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:31,320
made from hoba plants however that's all

639
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:33,360
you can make from hoba and it's a desert

640
00:22:31,319 --> 00:22:34,759
plant takes a long time to grow H grows

641
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:36,278
copiously throughout the world that's

642
00:22:34,759 --> 00:22:38,519
why we have these massive eradication

643
00:22:36,278 --> 00:22:39,880
programs because it produces so much and

644
00:22:38,519 --> 00:22:41,960
it can grow anywhere in the continental

645
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:45,720
United States paper and fiber can be

646
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:47,240
made out of things like canf or um or

647
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:49,360
sugar cane can be used for making paper

648
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:50,319
for example if you live in the tropics

649
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:51,319
but what you're saying we don't live in

650
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:52,918
the tropics what you're saying is

651
00:22:51,319 --> 00:22:54,599
there's only one plant that you know of

652
00:22:52,919 --> 00:22:55,799
that can do all of these things in all

653
00:22:54,599 --> 00:22:57,038
the climates there's a lot of plants

654
00:22:55,798 --> 00:22:58,158
that can do one or the other of these

655
00:22:57,038 --> 00:22:59,720
things but there's only one that can do

656
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:01,799
it all and produce the amount of volume

657
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:03,679
if you want to go for fuel production

658
00:23:01,798 --> 00:23:06,200
for example that's going to take tons

659
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:07,600
and tons of biomass there's no plant

660
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:09,080
that can do that on the continent of the

661
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:10,798
United States accepting for hemp to

662
00:23:09,079 --> 00:23:12,439
produce a volume corn produces one/

663
00:23:10,798 --> 00:23:14,319
tenth as much okay now when you're doing

664
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:17,360
it for biomass now you're saying that it

665
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:19,439
does a a cleaner thing to the air I mean

666
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:21,038
way you describe it almost like cleans

667
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,840
the air while it's up there I can't

668
00:23:21,038 --> 00:23:25,319
imagine that I mean and yet we've got

669
00:23:22,839 --> 00:23:27,399
cars throwing this our dinosaurs and

670
00:23:25,319 --> 00:23:30,319
shells up in the air right and when you

671
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:31,679
say that they here's the difference well

672
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:33,359
people have to understand I don't know

673
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:35,720
if this audience would know about what

674
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:38,519
biomass is biomass is energy that's

675
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:40,079
produced from living plant organisms

676
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:42,400
okay uh there a carbon that's in the

677
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:44,038
living plants that's then converted into

678
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,880
through a process that makes it into

679
00:23:44,038 --> 00:23:49,519
anything from gasoline to Charcoal

680
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:51,120
instead of coal uh to methanol and

681
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:52,918
methane gases you can make all kinds of

682
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:54,719
energy from it now the difference

683
00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:56,759
between these two things uh you can make

684
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:59,679
all those same sources of energy

685
00:23:56,759 --> 00:24:01,400
basically out of fossil fuels however

686
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:05,000
that's from living things that were

687
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:07,798
around um years millions of years ago

688
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,679
and the difference is that when you go

689
00:24:07,798 --> 00:24:10,960
to to dig the fossil fuels out of the

690
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:12,278
ground or whatever you're talking about

691
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,558
drilling you're talking about strip

692
00:24:12,278 --> 00:24:15,240
mining you're talking about pulling the

693
00:24:13,558 --> 00:24:17,038
stuff out of the ground burning it

694
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:19,679
putting into the air now when you're

695
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:22,119
going for a biomass you have the crop as

696
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:23,798
a crop grows it takes carbon dioxide out

697
00:24:22,119 --> 00:24:24,719
of the air and it puts out oxygen

698
00:24:23,798 --> 00:24:26,599
through a process known as

699
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,880
photosynthesis so you're constantly

700
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:30,000
recycling the air and that's where the

701
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:32,039
cleaning up is concerned and it also

702
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,200
reverses the greenhouse effect okay but

703
00:24:32,038 --> 00:24:36,079
now look if you know this is such a

704
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:38,480
great thing if hemp can do all these

705
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:40,038
marvelous things why why aren't other

706
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,159
countries jumping on the bandwagon say

707
00:24:40,038 --> 00:24:42,759
well we're going to grow hemp and we're

708
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:44,799
going to make paper and Fuel and fiber

709
00:24:42,759 --> 00:24:46,038
out of it I mean obviously America knows

710
00:24:44,798 --> 00:24:48,480
something that you know the rest of the

711
00:24:46,038 --> 00:24:50,240
world doesn't seem to know right yes and

712
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,480
no uh first off a lot of countries are

713
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,319
doing things for example we mentioned

714
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:55,759
that this stuff is here is from Russia

715
00:24:53,319 --> 00:24:59,038
these are from China this is from

716
00:24:55,759 --> 00:25:00,798
Hungary uh Czechoslovakia produced it uh

717
00:24:59,038 --> 00:25:02,158
Yugoslavia produces it we've got a lot

718
00:25:00,798 --> 00:25:03,960
of the world that does it what the

719
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:05,520
United States does is we control a lot

720
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:07,640
of the technology needed to move into

721
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:10,119
the next era of hemp Agriculture and

722
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:11,480
hemp Commerce and the hemp trades which

723
00:25:10,119 --> 00:25:13,759
we're suppressing for example the

724
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:15,079
machine that breaks down the hemp was

725
00:25:13,759 --> 00:25:18,879
patented in

726
00:25:15,079 --> 00:25:20,119
1936 uh hemp was outlawed in 1937 that

727
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,120
those patents were not released to the

728
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:22,439
rest of the world where hemp was still

729
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:23,959
being grown I have just one more

730
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:25,679
question we make it short please what

731
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:28,319
kind of timetable do you think we're on

732
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:29,720
as far as making this legal well it's

733
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:31,200
it's inevitable in terms of the

734
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:33,360
environmental and economic pressures

735
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:35,200
against this if we go into depression or

736
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:36,839
a heavy recession it'll probably happen

737
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,480
within the next couple of years I would

738
00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:39,798
say anywhere from one to five years

739
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,079
depending upon the amount of resistance

740
00:25:39,798 --> 00:25:43,398
and the ability of the American people

741
00:25:41,079 --> 00:25:44,839
to understand not only the importance of

742
00:25:43,398 --> 00:25:47,079
this thing but how the individual gains

743
00:25:44,839 --> 00:25:48,558
from it by more freedom more Choice more

744
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:51,119
products available more job

745
00:25:48,558 --> 00:25:53,599
opportunities okay now if anybody's

746
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:57,319
interested in finding out more about

747
00:25:53,599 --> 00:25:59,879
Bach organization or the uh things that

748
00:25:57,319 --> 00:26:01,519
we have here made of hemp there's a

749
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:04,120
number and an address flashing in front

750
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:05,519
of your screen you can contact uh Bach

751
00:26:04,119 --> 00:26:07,158
at the number and address that's showing

752
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:08,879
there or you can contact the hemp

753
00:26:07,159 --> 00:26:11,159
organization and there'll be somebody

754
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:13,960
there to be happy to answer your your

755
00:26:11,159 --> 00:26:15,880
questions and uh I have really enjoyed

756
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:17,360
having you as my guest today Chris I

hope to hear from some of your viewers

759
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,320
there's a lot more information as you

760
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:24,000
know that we can't get out in this I

761
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:27,038
know and I really I mean before meeting

762

you I had no idea you know of of half of

763
00:26:27,038 --> 00:26:31,720
what you were telling me and I hope the

764
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:33,240
uh viewers find that to be true too with

765
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:35,240
themselves and if there's ever a chance

00:26:37,398 --> 00:26:40,678
here for timeing for hemp and I want to

769
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:43,360
give a very nice thank you to the lady

770
