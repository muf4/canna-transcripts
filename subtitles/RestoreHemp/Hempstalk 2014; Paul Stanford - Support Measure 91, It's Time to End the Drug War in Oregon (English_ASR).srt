1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,400
you know this event is about ending

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:08,879
marijuana prohibition we have a big vote

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:11,919
to do that here in just less than 6

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:15,080
weeks now we need to make sure everyone

5
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:17,320
here is registered to vote that means if

6
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:22,480
you haven't had a ballot back in the

7
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:24,599
mail sometime in the past year you need

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,160
to go over and register to vote we're

9
00:00:24,599 --> 00:00:27,839
ready to do that you just step right

10
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,359
over to the booth over in the next

11
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:32,200
section register vote make sure get your

12
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:33,800
family and friends to register to vote

13
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:37,160
I'm going to tell you why you should

14
00:00:33,799 --> 00:00:40,479
vote for measure 91 because it's much

15
00:00:37,159 --> 00:00:43,119
better by far than the initiative that

16
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:45,119
is in effect now in Washington you know

17
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:48,558
Washington's law does not allow you to

18
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:52,159
grow any marijuana whatsoever and if you

19
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:55,679
have more than an ounce you are a

20
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:58,718
criminal and so this law will allow you

21
00:00:55,679 --> 00:01:01,039
to grow marijuana in your home and

22
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:04,799
possess marijuana that you've grown in

23
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:07,359
your home that makes it far superior by

24
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:10,880
itself but in Washington they actually

25
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:14,200
have three levels of Taxation as well in

26
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:18,319
Washington they tax the grower they tax

27
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:20,000
the processor and they tax the seller

28
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:24,919
and in each stage along the way that

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:28,680
increases the price and so this law will

30
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:30,359
only tax marijuana once and it's a set

31
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:34,280
fee tax

32
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:36,759
$35 an ounce that by that's just a

33
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:38,519
fraction of the tax in Washington the

34
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:42,399
tax in Washington is about

35
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:45,319
$350 an ounce this is about one10 that

36
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:49,118
tax it's a lot less than the tax in

37
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:53,039
Colorado as well also you'll only have

38
00:01:49,118 --> 00:01:55,200
one licensing fee if you want to grow

39
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:59,200
you want to process you want to make

40
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:01,799
extracts concentrates you want to retail

41
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,880
each business will have one annual fee

42
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:05,600
of only

43
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:08,079
$1,250 which is not chump change but

44
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:10,639
it's a lot less than the current

45
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,879
dispensary law that we have which has a

46
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:17,679
$44,000 per

47
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:20,079
location tax or an annual license fee so

48
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:23,280
I really see that marijuana will easily

49
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:26,280
be selling for less than $100 an ounce

50
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:31,800
maybe in some cases half that now the

51
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:35,800
tax on trim and con on trim and uh Shake

52
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:39,680
is only $10 an ounce so and there's a

53
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:43,760
one-time tax when it is purchased so

54
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:47,480
that's only a125 a gram so we'll be

55
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:50,719
seeing marijuana selling for $2 or $3 a

56
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:53,399
gram it will be very very easy to see

57
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:56,560
that happen so cannabis needs to be

58
00:02:53,400 --> 00:03:01,759
cheap and plentiful and this is the best

59
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,759
bill yet to make that so

60
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:08,318
so you know I urge you again to vote Yes

61
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,680
on measure 91 you know there are a lot

62
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:13,199
of businesses here and Boo and there's

63
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,920
twice as many over on the other side the

64
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:17,199
only reason we're able to put this on is

65
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:19,000
because they come and they help share

66
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:21,679
the bill to be able to make this thing

67
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:25,598
happen so we need to support our local

68
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:27,519
cannabis businesses so I urge you to

69
00:03:25,598 --> 00:03:29,798
visit these guys thank them show them

70
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,680
some love if you see something you like

71
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:33,640
go ahead and buy it from them but we

72
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,599
need to support our local cannabis

73
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:39,279
businesses and this new measure 91 will

74
00:03:36,598 --> 00:03:43,318
allow a lot of mom and pop businesses to

75
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:45,080
spring up you know it will allow uh

76
00:03:43,318 --> 00:03:47,199
economic boom here in the state of

77
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:49,080
Oregon and put us on The Cutting Edge of

78
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:51,759
exciting New Economic

79
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:55,120
developments you know I I know the only

80
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:58,399
reason marijuana was illegal was because

81
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:00,920
it was about money and power and greed

82
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,560
it's about the petem IAL pharmaceutical

83
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:07,280
military industrial transnational

84
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:10,319
corporate Elite crony capitalist ruling

85
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:14,799
class creating a myth about marijuana

86
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:17,918
that somehow it is bad but we know it's

87
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:20,199
not bad marijuana is actually good for

88
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:22,639
you you know when I was a kid my mom

89
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:25,080
thought marijuana like alcohol kills

90
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:27,400
your brain cells well now we know that

91
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:31,120
marijuana actually protects your brain

92
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:34,120
cells from trauma it will enhance your

93
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:36,280
longevity it will help you achieve

94
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:40,079
homeostasis but that's just about us

95
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:43,239
individually marijana will also help us

96
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:45,359
achieve balance for the whole planet

97
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:48,759
because we don't have to burn petroleum

98
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:51,759
for our fuel we can replace petroleum

99
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:56,080
with HP it makes more than three times

100
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:59,280
more seed oil biodel fuel than any other

101
00:04:56,079 --> 00:05:03,319
plant at the same time it makes four

102
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:06,279
time times more fiber for paper building

103
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:09,959
materials rope canvas lace and linen

104
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:13,279
than any other plant at the same time it

105
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:16,758
produces more protein digestible protein

106
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:19,399
that we can eat so it will solve so many

107
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:23,639
ecological problems and instead of our

108
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:27,439
money going to the Saudi chics and the

109
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:29,600
Nigerian despots and Exxon and mobile

110
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:31,918
and shell and into their Swiss bank

111
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,520
accounts the money will be going to our

112
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:36,719
Farmers who'll be spending in our

113
00:05:34,519 --> 00:05:38,439
communities and the wealth will be

114
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,960
shared around instead of seeing the

115
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:43,839
further centralization of economic

116
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:46,719
control that's been going on since they

117
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:48,519
prohibited hemp this will spread the

118
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,039
wealth and we'll see a decentralization

119
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:52,959
and all of us will benefit from that

120
00:05:51,038 --> 00:05:55,199
when the farmers can start spending that

121
00:05:52,959 --> 00:06:01,279
money in our local communities instead

122
00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:03,080
of to those petrochemical megga uh uh

123
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:06,159
corporations

124
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:08,800
so we're going to have a uh the next

125
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:12,680
singer as many of you might know is

126
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:16,038
Lucas Nelson and the promise of the Reel

127
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:17,800
they are an incredible band last night

128
00:06:16,038 --> 00:06:22,159
they backed up Neil

129
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:26,918
Young during his set and Willie Nelson

130
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:30,039
during his set at a protest benefit in

131
00:06:26,918 --> 00:06:32,959
Nebraska outside of Omaha and that was

132
00:06:30,038 --> 00:06:37,719
against the Keystone Pipeline carrying

133
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:40,439
the highly toxic Canadian tarand Oil

134
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:44,120
down over our main water resource in the

135
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:47,079
midwest the ogala aquafer where it could

136
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:51,199
poison the water of the whole

137
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:54,598
Midwest so last night Lucas Nelson and

138
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:57,160
prise of the Reel were working to stop

139
00:06:54,598 --> 00:06:59,759
the petrochemical monster corporations

140
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:02,479
from polluting our Earth to tonight

141
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:06,080
they're here to support the replacement

142
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:08,360
of petroleum with industrial hemp and

143
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:11,680
that is what we want to see

144
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:15,439
folks you know everything petroleum

145
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:18,160
touches is toxified everything that uh

146
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:20,160
you know when when that Exon vales

147
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:23,800
dumped the load of petroleum in Prince

148
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:25,680
Williams Sound 25 years ago in Alaska it

149
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:28,319
poisoned that whole sound for

150
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:32,639
Generations if that had been hip seed

151
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:34,840
oil would have enriched the the the

152
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:37,038
ecology the birds instead of being

153
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:40,758
killed would have been able to eat that

154
00:07:37,038 --> 00:07:41,918
and got nutrition you know so we need to

155
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:45,158
replace

156
00:07:41,918 --> 00:07:48,120
petroleum and hemp can do it that's the

157
00:07:45,158 --> 00:07:52,000
real goal here remember drugs are just a

158
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:54,598
smoke screen it's really about

159
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,560
petrochemicals and that's why they

160
00:07:54,598 --> 00:08:00,158
prohibit it and that's why we have to

161
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:03,439
Legalize It

162
00:08:00,158 --> 00:08:05,639
again I want to encourage you to support

163
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:07,360
all of these businesses out here and

164
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:09,560
