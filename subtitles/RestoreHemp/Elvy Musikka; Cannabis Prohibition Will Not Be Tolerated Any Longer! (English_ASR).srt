1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:04,379
it really blows my mind to understand

2
00:00:02,158 --> 00:00:06,778
that this war started a hundred years

3
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:10,320
ago her started their false propaganda

4
00:00:06,778 --> 00:00:12,300
the lies renamed the plan hemp renamed

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,699
the plant cannabis and called it

6
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:16,500
marijuana because he lost a lot of

7
00:00:14,699 --> 00:00:18,599
Timber to the Mexicans he wasn't too

8
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:22,019
happy with them but California started

9
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:24,000
the law in 1913. several States followed

10
00:00:22,019 --> 00:00:26,359
quickly and before you knew it the

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,079
conglomerate of the industrial complex

12
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:33,780
had managed to pass a bill because the

13
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:37,738
marijuana Tax Act of 1937. it was proven

14
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:39,600
unconstitutional by 1969 and and Nixon

15
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:41,279
you didn't have much time to keep this

16
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,320
law going so he gathered his

17
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,539
conservative friends to give him advice

18
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,460
and find nasty things to say about this

19
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:49,738
plant but they found the opposite as

20
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:52,140
usual they found it is not have it

21
00:00:49,738 --> 00:00:54,599
forming it does not lead to other drugs

22
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:58,020
it doesn't do any of the things that you

23
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,760
said that they said they do and so he

24
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:01,940
didn't like that report he tore it up

25
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:01,939
through it

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,438
report and but here's the tragedy so

27
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,118
actually the only federal law you law

28
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:11,039
enforcement listen carefully because you

29
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:15,959
two cannot use uphold our constitution

30
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:18,420
too that lie which disrespects my fourth

31
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:20,399
and fifth amendment rights that light

32
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:22,079
has kept me from getting a job since the

33
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,600
80s so now I live with a miserable

34
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:28,679
income and you got to support me that

35
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:30,478
same lie has put over 20 million of us

36
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,000
on their arrest at one time or another

37
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:35,400
now how many of us are are there here

38
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,859
how many people smoke marijuana in this

39
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:40,799
country what is the percentage of what

40
00:01:37,859 --> 00:01:43,259
you arrest is it one percent is it ten

41
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,479
percent is it four percent well whatever

42
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:48,799
you think it is multiply that by 25

43
00:01:45,478 --> 00:01:52,500
million and you might get a clue a hint

44
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:53,880
why are we forced to follow this is the

45
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:57,000
federal law they try to put on the

46
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:59,699
states and everyone else to follow the

47
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:04,019
legacy of a man who left the presidency

48
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:06,420
in this grace for lack of honesty this

49
00:02:04,019 --> 00:02:08,879
needs to end that is one of the main

50
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:11,520
reasons I'm asking everybody to vote for

51
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:15,000
80 to both to help the people in

52
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:17,939
Colorado in Michigan and send a clear

53
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,539
message to the administration this will

54
00:02:17,939 --> 00:02:23,400
not be tolerated any longer we have not

55
00:02:21,539 --> 00:02:25,859
that's why there are millions of us

56
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:28,260
Breaking Your Law every day has no

57
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:29,400
respect for us it doesn't deserve

58
00:02:28,259 --> 00:02:32,399
respect

59
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:34,620
now change it please change it vote on

60
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,260
80. if you live in other states help

61
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:40,020
those ones in Colorado and Michigan and

62
00:02:37,259 --> 00:02:42,419
definitely con contact your legislators

63
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:46,260
and your president and remind you remind

64
00:02:42,419 --> 00:02:48,780
them that this man changed these laws

65
00:02:46,259 --> 00:02:51,299
all by himself with no help from the

66
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:53,280
Congress or the Senate it was just an

67
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:56,280
order that he gave that we're living

68
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,080
under this lie and this lie has to end

69
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,860
five generations of lies and

70
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,900
misinformation has rendered us a nation

71
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:06,900
very very incapable of making rational

72
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:09,060
decisions mostly because our system is

73
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:11,939
not satisfied the endocannabinite system

74
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:14,400
that opens our mind and expands our

75
00:03:11,939 --> 00:03:17,000
thinking and allows us to be real human

76
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,000
beings
