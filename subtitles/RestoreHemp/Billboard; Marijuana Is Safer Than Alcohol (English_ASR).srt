1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,060
you

2
00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:08,250
alcohol Awareness Month is an opportune

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:11,339
time to be talking about the relative

4
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:14,280
harms of alcohol and marijuana this

5
00:00:11,339 --> 00:00:16,199
billboard isn't simply saying go ahead

6
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:19,589
and choose one or the other it's saying

7
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:20,969
don't just drink think about the

8
00:00:19,589 --> 00:00:23,399
circumstances think about what you're

9
00:00:20,969 --> 00:00:24,929
consuming if you're enjoying a glass of

10
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:26,879
beer if you're enjoying a glass of wine

11
00:00:24,929 --> 00:00:30,059
a great Oregon IPA if you're enjoying a

12
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:31,739
great Oregon Pinot Noir you think about

13
00:00:30,059 --> 00:00:34,049
how adults who choose to use marijuana

14
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:35,488
for many of the same reasons to relax to

15
00:00:34,049 --> 00:00:37,709
socialize with friends to enjoy

16
00:00:35,488 --> 00:00:40,140
themselves to be responsible but to

17
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:42,359
consume responsibly in that manner think

18
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,739
about what message we're sending to

19
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:45,689
those adults and what message we're

20
00:00:43,738 --> 00:00:48,089
sending to future generations when we

21
00:00:45,689 --> 00:00:50,549
tell people we're going to punish them

22
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:52,230
for making a choice that is safer than

23
00:00:50,549 --> 00:00:54,390
alcohol and we are going to encourage

24
00:00:52,229 --> 00:00:57,449
them to consume a substance that's more

25
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:59,820
dangerous if you are in a situation

26
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:01,640
where you can choose to consume alcohol

27
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:04,289
or you can choose to consume marijuana

28
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:06,478
society will tell you it's better that

29
00:01:04,289 --> 00:01:09,719
you choose alcohol even if it's bad for

30
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:11,189
you even if it makes you violent even if

31
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:13,890
you're breaking the law in some cases

32
00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:15,689
underage drinking so we as a society

33
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:17,819
have been encouraging people to consume

34
00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:21,090
alcohol and what we are saying in Oregon

35
00:01:17,819 --> 00:01:22,469
is we're not we're not jeopardizing and

36
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:24,149
we're not threatening the stability of

37
00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:25,679
Oregon's beer and wine industry there

38
00:01:24,149 --> 00:01:28,170
are combined three billion dollar a year

39
00:01:25,679 --> 00:01:30,679
industry they're going to be fine what

40
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:33,209
we're saying is for adults who choose to

41
00:01:30,679 --> 00:01:35,159
consume marijuana because it's safer for

42
00:01:33,209 --> 00:01:36,990
them because they prefer marijuana over

43
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:38,848
alcohol they shouldn't be criminalized

44
00:01:36,989 --> 00:01:40,228
they shouldn't be ostracized they

45
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:41,969
shouldn't be stigmatized we should be

46
00:01:40,228 --> 00:01:43,829
treating them with respect and we should

47
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:47,250
be letting them make that safer choice

48
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:48,840
what we're saying is we have established

49
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:50,789
a way to regulate alcohol in this

50
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,429
industry in this in this economy and we

51
00:01:50,789 --> 00:01:55,709
celebrate alcohol as a society we're

52
00:01:53,429 --> 00:01:58,259
going to do that knowing the harms that

53
00:01:55,709 --> 00:02:00,329
alcohol presents let's at least not

54
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:01,010
punish people who want to make a safer

55
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:03,079
choice

56
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:05,090
are you worried that the billboard might

57
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:07,280
discourage people from going over to

58
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:10,159
your festival and drinking some beer

59
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,990
wine not in the least i'm looking

60
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:14,210
forward to those people coming over and

61
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:15,650
we're looking forward to this moving

62
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:18,560
forward and hopefully it will get

63
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:20,659
legalized at some point it brings in a

64
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,370
lot of tourist dollars and we are a

65
00:02:20,659 --> 00:02:23,990
tourist industry when we put on this

66
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:25,849
vessel we get people from all around the

67
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:27,800
world we'd like to see more people show

68
00:02:25,849 --> 00:02:29,449
up and enjoy our fine products and this

69
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,370
is going to be one of them all the

70
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:33,109
batter do you think marijuana is safer

71
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:35,629
than beer and wine it is safer than beer

72
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:38,120
and wine why are you so certain well

73
00:02:35,629 --> 00:02:39,769
I've been using for 44 years so I have

74
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,900
at least a little bit background on it

75
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:43,189
and I feel it's extremely safe for

76
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:45,469
people and it's actually it's not just

77
00:02:43,189 --> 00:02:46,759
say it's medicine how do you have a

78
00:02:45,469 --> 00:02:50,270
medical miracle i do have been in

79
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:53,479
america and i wish this would progress

80
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:55,340
sooner i'm glad that or Washington and

81
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:57,319
Colorado have taken the lead on this

82
00:02:55,340 --> 00:03:00,439
Oregon should be right there with it and

83
00:02:57,319 --> 00:03:03,799
if we could move it along quicker next

84
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:05,180
year Easter is on 4 20 well there you go

85
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,680
what about moms and dads who are

86
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:08,420
watching who might have teenagers at

87
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,890
home who are impressionable and think

88
00:03:08,419 --> 00:03:11,659
this sends the wrong message to them

89
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:14,379
that is a discussion they will have to

90
00:03:11,659 --> 00:03:14,379
have with their kids

91
00:03:14,909 --> 00:03:16,969
you
