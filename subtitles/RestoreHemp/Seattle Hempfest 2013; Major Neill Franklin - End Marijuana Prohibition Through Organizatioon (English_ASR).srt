1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,799
i've been to many events

2
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:07,679
with thousands of people

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:09,519
and i have never seen such a community

4
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:12,239
in my life

5
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:13,919
and i thank you for that

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,599
i thank you for that i'm gonna pass it

7
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:17,600
down so you just

8
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,039
you don't get the whole bag i see you're

9
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,400
thinking something about what's in this

10
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:22,400
bag and i know what's on your mind

11
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:27,840
washington state and colorado have done

12
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:30,079
amazing things and it's not washington

13
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:32,238
state for instance it is the people of

14
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:35,280
washington state it is the people of

15
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:38,000
colorado who have moved forward with

16
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,480
legalization of marijuana in these two

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,480
states so i applaud the people for

18
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:45,679
coming out coming forward making their

19
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:47,279
voices heard and being organized

20
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:48,960
in making it happen you see because

21
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,879
that's key

22
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,840
you have to be organized if you want to

23
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:53,839
get something done

24
00:00:56,558 --> 00:01:00,479
you have to reach out to your

25
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,239
legislators and your politicians and you

26
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:04,079
have to make them do what needs to be

27
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:06,158
done and in order to do that you have to

28
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:08,079
be organized

29
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:10,880
i don't have much more to say

30
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:12,959
but two things

31
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:14,560
number one we all come here from many

32
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:16,319
different perspectives and for many

33
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:20,320
different reasons

34
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:22,478
for ending the prohibition of marijuana

35
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:25,359
we all have one goal in mind that is to

36
00:01:22,478 --> 00:01:28,478
remove marijuana from the scheduling

37
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:30,799
system in its entirety not down one or

38
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:32,400
two levels but completely out of the

39
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,880
scheduling system

40
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,118
we all come here for that we all need to

41
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:38,719
come together work together make that

42
00:01:37,118 --> 00:01:40,159
happen and i know we can do it we've

43
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:41,359
done it in washington we've done it in

44
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,479
colorado

45
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:47,200
and what i ask of you as i close

46
00:01:44,478 --> 00:01:49,679
is to help me take this steamroller

47
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,399
because that's what it is

48
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,640
completely across the country

49
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:58,239
all the way to my hometown of baltimore

50
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:02,478
maryland are you with me on that

51
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:05,359
and i will be here until it's done

52
00:02:02,478 --> 00:02:08,159
if it takes me to the age of 95

53
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:09,598
but i don't think that will happen

54
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:12,079
thank you folks

55
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:13,759
