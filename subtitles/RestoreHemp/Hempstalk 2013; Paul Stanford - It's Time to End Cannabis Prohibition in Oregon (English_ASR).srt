1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:06,839
we are here today to celebrate hip and

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:09,599
cannabis and we're also happy to

3
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:12,880
announce the launch of a campaign to put

4
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:16,679
this thing back on the ballot last uh

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:21,199
November we got 47% of the vote

6
00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:24,759
statewide 61% right here in Moma County

7
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:26,400
63% in Portland so Portland loves

8
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:30,720
cannabis we might as well just take the

9
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:32,439
r out of Portland right now but

10
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:36,799
you know we just launched we got

11
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:40,480
approval yesterday afternoon at

12
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:42,759
4:45 to circulate our petition to

13
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:46,159
legalize marijuana and we have two

14
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:48,198
petitions one is a statutory measure

15
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:51,319
that's a law and the other one's a

16
00:00:48,198 --> 00:00:53,039
constitutional amendment so it says our

17
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:56,000
constitutional amendment basically says

18
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:59,960
that you can possess use and grow

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,439
marijuana and the state can uh enact

20
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:06,439
laws to regulate the sale of marijuana

21
00:01:02,439 --> 00:01:09,840
to adults and then the statutory measure

22
00:01:06,438 --> 00:01:12,359
is almost exactly like measure 80 last

23
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,520
year with a couple of changes to make

24
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:18,799
our opposition's arguments disappear to

25
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:21,478
a certain degree you know it looks

26
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:25,079
possible at this stage that next

27
00:01:21,478 --> 00:01:28,118
February our Oregon legislature will put

28
00:01:25,078 --> 00:01:30,399
a bill out there and refer a bill to

29
00:01:28,118 --> 00:01:33,319
regulate marijuana to the people

30
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,240
but if they don't then we've got two

31
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:36,959
initiatives ready to go if the

32
00:01:35,239 --> 00:01:39,640
legislature puts a bill out there we

33
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:41,879
will stop our statutory measure just

34
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:45,399
move forward with our constitutional

35
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:47,478
one but we can't you know we're trying

36
00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:49,280
to put pressure on them to act and maybe

37
00:01:47,478 --> 00:01:53,118
they will and several legislators have

38
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:55,640
said they want to but so far we don't

39
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:59,959
have any guarantees but we have a

40
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:02,439
guarantee that if we get over $882,000

41
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:05,359
ballot Oregon voter signatures we can

42
00:02:02,438 --> 00:02:09,038
put that statutory measure on the ballot

43
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:10,399
again and if we get over 16,000

44
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:12,519
signatures then we can put the

45
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,360
Constitutional Amendment on the ballot

46
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:17,400
so we're trying to make the people of

47
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:18,920
our state vote twice to legalize

48
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:22,200
marijuana in

49
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:23,518
2014 if the legislature doesn't do it we

50
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:29,238
will that's

51
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:30,759
right you know for me pip cannabis

52
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:34,120
marijuana

53
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:36,120
are really the same thing late great

54
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:38,120
friend of mine Kentucky attorney gatew

55
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,080
go named the people who we really

56
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:42,840
responsible for this and it's the

57
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:45,640
petrochemical pharmaceutical military

58
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:47,519
industrial transnational corporate Elite

59
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:51,000
fascist sons of a

60
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:54,920
and they sold us that there was

61
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,479
a deadly new drug called marijuana and

62
00:02:54,919 --> 00:03:01,039
it was based on this anti-hispanic

63
00:02:57,479 --> 00:03:03,399
racism that they use this word marijuana

64
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:07,120
if they said hip they never would have

65
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:09,280
been able to criminalize it so you know

66
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,039
they created this to protect the

67
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:14,840
petrochemical and fi wood fiber

68
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:17,239
Industries and so if they said it was a

69
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:20,239
deadly new drug but really it's the

70
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:23,200
oldest crop known to man all

71
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:26,239
archaeologists agree that marijuana has

72
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:30,119
been cultivated at least 12,000 years

73
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:32,560
and maybe over 30,000 years you know the

74
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:35,080
first agricultural crop it might be the

75
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,640
very reason that our

76
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:40,640
ancestors gave up the hunter gather way

77
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:43,399
of life and started planning plants so

78
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:45,878
they could have a stash and they could

79
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:49,200
have you know they found Frozen remains

80
00:03:45,878 --> 00:03:51,759
and tombs where the people are buried or

81
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:54,479
die carrying their herb with them the

82
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:59,479
same way I will be found carry my her

83
00:03:54,479 --> 00:04:01,798
with me but the uh the truth of the

84
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:04,280
matter matter is that it's really about

85
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:07,640
Fuel and fiber the drugs are just a

86
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:09,799
smoke screen it's really about money

87
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:11,878
power and the continued centralization

88
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:15,760
of Economic and political

89
00:04:11,878 --> 00:04:18,599
control so our initiatives are out there

90
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:20,680
and we need you to get involved go right

91
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:24,560

00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:41,439
happen I also want to thank all our

99
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:42,879
vendors out there who who come out here

100
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:45,079
and made this all

101
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:47,159
possible uh we ran into a lot of

102
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:49,680
roadblocks cost us a lot of money at the

103
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:53,160
last minute the city actually came

104
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:55,600
forward and required that we hire 30

105
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:58,759
additional security people they told us

106
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,240
last week they also said we have to pay

107
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:02,439
$4,000

108
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,840
plus dollars for a parking Patrol to

109
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:07,360
give us tickets out on the street they

110
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:10,000
basically dropped $30,000 worth of bills

111
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:13,360
on us the last minute trying to say if

112
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:18,199
you don't do it no permit well we've did

113
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:20,439
it you know we put it together but uh

114
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:23,038
you know I just want you to know it

115
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:26,918
takes a lot of volunteer effort a lot of

116
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:28,959
volunteer work and as several people

117
00:05:26,918 --> 00:05:32,439
have said from this stage Freedom isn't

118
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:35,198
free it's constantly being assaulted and

119
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:36,560
it's two steps forward and one step back

120
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,919
right now we're seeing some steps

121
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,439
forward the votes in Washington and

122
00:05:38,918 --> 00:05:45,959
Colorado have changed the whole dynamic

123
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:49,719
you know we got 47% of the vote last

124
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:52,000
November but recent polls have shown

125
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:54,800
that the support for cannabis

126
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,560
legalization now is up over

127
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:00,079
63% so we put something on the ballot

128
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,280
they know we're going to win in next

129
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:06,519
time people are educated so help us do

130
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:09,279
that get involved register to vote help

131
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:10,799
