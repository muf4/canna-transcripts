affiliate to National normal I'm on the

4
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:14,559
board of normal and I'm also the owner

5
00:00:12,199 --> 00:00:15,919
and founder of the World Famous Cannabis

6
00:00:14,558 --> 00:00:18,559
Cafe I don't know if you've heard about

7
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:20,719
it but it got a lot of news coverage

8
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:23,598
which was really exciting but in our

9
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:26,079
state we have a new Progressive um

10
00:00:23,599 --> 00:00:28,960
measure on the ballot and it's measure

11
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:30,678
74 and John sjo back there I just want

12
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,239
to congratulate you for getting it on

13
00:00:30,678 --> 00:00:37,679
the ballot John you worked hard

14
00:00:33,238 --> 00:00:40,159
yeah yeah it's a regulated Supply system

15
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:42,119
for medical marijuana patients and

16
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:44,959
medical marijuana what a beautiful thing

17
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:47,320
that's how I became an activist because

18
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,600
I somebody told me know it Kaiser they

19
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:51,079
said no you can't have medical marijuana

20
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,840
because you don't have glaucoma cancer

21
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:56,359
or Aids well I don't take no for an

22
00:00:53,840 --> 00:01:00,559
answer very well I'm a product of the'

23
00:00:56,359 --> 00:01:02,840
60s the turbulent 60s a child of Dr King

24
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:05,280
and I don't take no for an answer I'm

25
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:07,439
one of those fiery Latinas that says oh

26
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,920
what do you mean no so anyway Kaiser

27
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:10,559
ended up giving me one of their first

28
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:13,400
letters saying that it was okay for me

29
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,960
to use medical marijuana and I have been

30
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:17,439
there since the implementation of the

31
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:19,438
Oregon medical marijuana act fighting in

32
00:01:17,438 --> 00:01:22,279
one way or another to make sure that

33
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:25,359
patients rights were not stepped on

34
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:30,759
trampled on and we've actually be been

35
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:33,519
able to uh get 24 o of storage marijuana

36
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:35,438
we started out with three which was

37
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:37,798
laughable because how do you control a

38
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:40,639
plant with three you know make sure that

39
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:43,159
you only have 3 o well we fought every

40
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:46,799
step of the way we finally got um in

41
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:49,840
2007 24 o of usable marijuana which was

42
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,680
a huge success for all of us believe me

43
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,719
it was amazing to be able to have that

44
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,880
much at the legislature we sat down and

45
00:01:54,718 --> 00:01:58,759
we spoke with law enforcement they had

46
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:00,239
been after the affirmative defense for

47
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:02,599
years and they were going to come and

48
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:04,118
take it and give us nothing in return

49
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:07,199
and regulate it to the point where there

50
00:02:04,118 --> 00:02:08,719
was only one growth for per residence so

51
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,840
that wasn't going to happen but you know

52
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:13,598
I found that uh legislator legislators

53
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,878
are actually really nice people if you

54
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:17,639
sit down and talk to them they have

55
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:19,959
stories as well so please I I always

56
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:22,559
tell people you got to get involved like

57
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:24,640
Douglas and Brian and everyone else you

58
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,959
got to get down there and you got to let

59
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:29,479
them know who you are and we teach you

60
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:30,479
know patients and other members of

61
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:33,119
normal

62
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:35,359
how to use those tools effectively how

63
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,519
to make sure that they go and they make

64
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,280
contact with these people of course like

65
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:42,640
everyone else my dream is legalization

66
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:44,039
and um boy I really am excited Douglas

67
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:46,079
about your language and I'd like to see

68
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:47,598
if we can do it in Oregon with you

69
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,599
because I think it's going to take the

70
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:52,039
whole country yeah we're going to have

71
00:02:49,598 --> 00:02:54,399
to unite and get this taken care of

72
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:56,560
because although medical marijuana is a

73
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,760
beautiful thing in my state people are

74
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,680
losing their jobs every day because of a

75
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:03,719
dirty UA I mean it's just not acceptable

76
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,400
they're losing their children their

77
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:08,039
children are being taken away from them

78
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:11,120
in dirty custody battles where someone

79
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:12,919
says you use medical marijuana I mean I

80
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,840
can't even tell you if someone tried to

81
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:17,759
take my child for me I would not be able

82
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:19,959
to breathe and so to think that someone

83
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:22,318
can take your child from you even though

84
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:24,759
you've applied for the protections

85
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:27,000
afforded to you is just not acceptable

86
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:29,959
anymore that's why I say it's time for

87
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,479
us to all stand up put the joint down

88
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:33,719
away from your bong just for a little

89
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:36,199
while I mean I've been smoking since I

90
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:39,959
was 16 and I'm not going to put it down

91
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:42,479
I'm going to smoke until the day that I

92
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:45,400
die I'm looking for somebody to hook me

93
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:47,238
up with one of those oxygen uh things so

94
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,599
I can just vaporize through the little

95
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:51,400
nostril part you know when I get too old

96
00:03:49,598 --> 00:03:52,719
but no I'm going to and I think it's

97
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,079
important for all of us you know uh

98
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:58,120
Douglas was just talking about hemp and

99
00:03:55,079 --> 00:04:01,000
I watch Jack har as emperor of hemp may

100
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:03,680
he rest in peace and actually tattooed

101
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,280
it on my arm I always I always wanted a

102
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:09,719
big tattoo and I've got Tai ma the first

103
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:12,318
character for H Ma on my arm and and

104
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:14,680
that man was a hero to me and he made me

105
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:17,879
the hemp activist I am today because

106
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:20,918
America's roots are hemp Roots our

107
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:23,279
financial our foundation our economy

108
00:04:20,918 --> 00:04:24,719
actually used hemp in it and why aren't

109
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:26,679
we using why aren't we going back to

110
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,880
those roots I hear people constantly

111
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:31,959
touting oh our Founders our found our

112
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:34,159
founders were hemp Farmers because they

113
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:36,399
were smart enough just like birds to eat

114
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,639
the hemp seed you know when you think

115
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:40,879
about it birds are more intelligent than

116
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,800
our Congress people than our own

117
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:45,360
government they'll eat those hemp seeds

118
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,879
first and we need to make that clear to

119
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,280
our to our Congress we need to make that

120
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:52,959
clear to President Obama we have hemp

121
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:55,279
fuel no other Americans should go die

122
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:57,918
for a foreign fuel we can we can grow it

123
00:04:55,279 --> 00:05:00,719
in our country the residue from that

124
00:04:57,918 --> 00:05:03,038
fuel once it's pressed is H flower rich

125
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:06,400
in the omegas I mean we all fight for

126
00:05:03,038 --> 00:05:08,918
this and we we must continue to move

127
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:11,879
forward in our state we're lucky enough

128
00:05:08,918 --> 00:05:14,839
that our Senator Floyd pansy actually

129
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:16,639
passed legislation where hemp is now

130
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:18,560
something that's acceptable it's the law

131
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:21,439
in the state of Oregon but of course

132
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:24,038
those pesky feds we're waiting for their

133
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:26,759
approval as always with everything and

134
00:05:24,038 --> 00:05:28,800
that's why I think Douglas's approach to

135
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:30,280
marijuana may I ask you I'm just going

136
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,319
to ask this public because I've asked

137
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:35,839
other people as an attorney if we

138
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:37,960
legalize marijuana isn't hemp then legal

139
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:41,719
in some states yes and in some states

140
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:43,599
know um our initiative removes ambiguity

141
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:45,680
but a lot of states have measures in

142
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:49,080
place that if the federal government

143
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:51,038
changes its stance on hemp um or on hemp

144
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:54,478
permits that they can go immediately I

145
00:05:51,038 --> 00:05:55,918
know kck's one I know North Dakota's one

146
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:57,918
um so there are some states that are

147
00:05:55,918 --> 00:06:00,399
ready to go in the way they've defined

148
00:05:57,918 --> 00:06:02,079
the marijuana plant um um so yeah there

149
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:04,318
are some states that would be it would

150
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:05,719
be legal the minut at the feds say so

151
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,199
excellent so I'm going to stop using the

152
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:10,000
word regulate now I got a good lesson

153
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:12,560
just like the rest of you no more

154
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
regulation we're just going to legalize

155
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,759
that's the new term and I don't know

156
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,839
what what what we can say because when

157
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:21,000
you say the word legalization it really

158
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:23,638
does scare a lot of people and when you

159
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,120
say the TA the word tax that frightens

160
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:27,639
them even more they just want to turn

161
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,959
around and run away because that's it's

162
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:33,319
scary to think of being taxed again

163
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:35,038
especially in this economic time but I

164
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:36,680
think that when we look at our economy

165
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:39,598
and if we look at the fact that in the

166
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:41,879
state of Oregon for us 350,000

167
00:06:39,598 --> 00:06:44,399
oregonians consume cannabis on a regular

168
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:46,839
basis according to government statistics

169
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:49,120
so if we look at that as in an economic

170
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:50,719
from an economic perspective it seems

171
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,918
like with medical marijuana patients

172
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,880
we're targeting the wrong population

173
00:06:52,918 --> 00:06:56,359
segment of the population we should be

174
00:06:54,879 --> 00:07:01,240
targeting that

175
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:03,720
350 you know thousand people or more and

176
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:05,759
get this get these jobs going we need

177
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:08,160
green jobs hey they don't get much

178
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:10,439
greener than growing pot I actually went

179
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,120
to one of my legislators and said you

180
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:14,800
know I used to work in a women's prison

181
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:16,759
and we have all this property in there

182
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,800
and I said why don't we use that land

183
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:21,080
and we have all these wonderful students

184
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,360
that know how to grow why don't we grow

185
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:26,918
marijuana for the patients in the in the

186
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,840
prison Security's there you know some

187
00:07:26,918 --> 00:07:30,918
people have said I was crazy I'm well

188
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:33,159
maybe I am a little crazy maybe I am a

189
00:07:30,918 --> 00:07:35,120
dreamer you know but I think that we can

190
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:37,800
make it all work with all the money we

191
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:40,439
spend on the prison system let's get

192
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:43,520
something in return don't you think I

193
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:45,560
mean why not uh Jeff Merkley now is one

194
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:47,439
of our Congress people and but he did he

195
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,879
had the conversation with me at least he

196
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:50,959
was open enough to have that

197
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:53,280
conversation people aren't always trying

198
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:55,158
to get into prison so when and it's not

199
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:59,638
easy to get out I can tell you for one

200
00:07:55,158 --> 00:08:02,519
thing so uh hey why not but uh anyway uh

201
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:04,879
I am uh pushing it every way I can to

202
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:07,198
make sure that we let people know that

203
