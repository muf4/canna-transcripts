1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,509
hey everybody thanks for coming out

2
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:05,459
today my name is Don skakki I'm a

3
00:00:03,509 --> 00:00:07,139
Washington resident and currently

4
00:00:05,459 --> 00:00:10,379
working at the Northwest cannabis cafe

5
00:00:07,139 --> 00:00:13,379
in Portland Oregon so I guess I'm by

6
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:15,980
state right now because I was last

7
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:18,710
Monday in the capital in Olympia

8
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:22,820
speaking about home grow from Washington

9
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:26,070
we heard that after her encouragement

10
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:27,660
comments by the Chairman that the

11
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:30,149
opposition would lie on the other house

12
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:32,850
the Chairman did not even allow a vote

13
00:00:30,149 --> 00:00:34,320
of his own committee to get it out so

14
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:38,489
we're not looking good up there in

15
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:41,579
Washington I really am amazed at the

16
00:00:38,488 --> 00:00:43,558
parallels between the two states here be

17
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:47,579
cautious look to what's happening up

18
00:00:43,558 --> 00:00:49,530
there because I see it coming here you

19
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:50,850
know don't be satisfied that there are

20
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:53,160
people here and they're great people

21
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:55,948
here on our side that speak for you or

22
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:58,288
speak for your interest but only you can

23
00:00:55,948 --> 00:01:01,019
speak for you and it's critically

24
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:04,588
important that you do that on this table

25
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:06,210

26
00:01:04,588 --> 00:01:09,269
information for the committee members

27
00:01:06,209 --> 00:01:10,889
for the implementation and also you need

28
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:13,438

36

39
00:01:34,739 --> 00:01:39,408

my health I need to smoke during the day

41
00:01:39,409 --> 00:01:44,159
and I got to tell you something else

42
00:01:41,719 --> 00:01:46,140
it's become obvious since we've been

43
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,229
open since we were we open there I have

44
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:51,030
stopped weekend and each day more and

45
00:01:49,228 --> 00:01:53,819
more people come in and it's not just

46
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:56,968
patients its regular everyday folks it's

47
00:01:53,819 --> 00:01:58,679
the homeless people it's the people that

48
00:01:56,968 --> 00:02:00,298
we got a lovely young couple of lives in

49
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,469
a trailer that brings her friends and

50
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:04,140
when they come to visit cuz they've got

51
00:02:01,468 --> 00:02:06,179
nowhere to entertain it's tourists that

52
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:08,818
can't smoke in the room they come to

53
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:11,099
oregon they want to smoke pot they want

54
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:11,679
to check it out and you can't smoke it

55
00:02:11,098 --> 00:02:13,869
in public

56
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,150
and you can't smoke it in your hotel and

57
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:18,310
you can't maybe smoke it in your housing

58
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:20,019
because it's federally funded or you

59
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:21,400
just don't want to we've got another

60
00:02:20,019 --> 00:02:24,218
couple that comes in because I don't

61
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:27,930
want to smoke around their kids you know

62
00:02:24,218 --> 00:02:30,579
the social aspect of cannabis is strong

63
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:33,790
it's one of the strongest ties amongst

64
00:02:30,579 --> 00:02:35,950
all of us and to be able to go out and

65
00:02:33,789 --> 00:02:38,709
enjoy each other socially in an

66
00:02:35,949 --> 00:02:41,768
alcohol-free environment and leave

67
00:02:38,709 --> 00:02:44,650
knowing that raw safe and happy it's

68
00:02:41,769 --> 00:02:48,039
just astounding to me and the fact they

69
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:50,200
want to shut us down I mean it's not

70
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:52,418
healthy right now it's freaking cold all

71
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:55,568
right and to go to our club right now

72
00:02:52,419 --> 00:02:58,840
the OHA rules is you can have to go

73
00:02:55,568 --> 00:03:00,759
outside well fortunately we've invested

74
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:03,430
in the club and built an outdoor area

75
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:05,949
that's covered with some eaters and it's

76
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:08,919
nice but it's not indoors and it's not

77
00:03:05,949 --> 00:03:11,828
like the beauty of the club inside we

78
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:15,099
need to make the adjustments we got to

79
00:03:11,829 --> 00:03:17,229
remember these legislators are just

80
00:03:15,098 --> 00:03:19,568
regular folks all right they're not

81
00:03:17,229 --> 00:03:22,810
experts in all the issues that come

82
00:03:19,568 --> 00:03:24,878
before them they look upon the public to

83
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:28,120
educate them on what's important and

84
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:30,628
that's why the lobbyists get their ear

85
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:33,459
you know when when you come down here

86
00:03:30,628 --> 00:03:35,709
you have to take time off of work or

87
00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:38,469
time away from your family or travel

88
00:03:35,709 --> 00:03:41,139
here and expense and and you know it's

89
00:03:38,469 --> 00:03:43,000
not easy when somebody's paying you to

90
00:03:41,139 --> 00:03:44,169
be a lobbyist it's easy it's your job

91
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,539
you get up in the morning put on your

92
00:03:44,169 --> 00:03:47,829
suit and tie hop in the car put some gas

93
00:03:46,539 --> 00:03:51,548
in the car and away you go because

94
00:03:47,829 --> 00:03:54,489
you've been paid well we need us each to

95
00:03:51,549 --> 00:03:57,340

96
00:03:54,489 --> 00:04:00,219
legislators so please if you're not

97
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:02,348

98
00:04:00,219 --> 00:04:05,348
information of the committee members if

99
00:04:02,348 --> 00:04:07,119
