years we've been in Salem for six years

00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:27,560
with not one altercation not one problem

9
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:30,570
never a DUI not even a noise violation

10
00:00:27,559 --> 00:00:32,879
cannabis patients our local cannabis

11
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:34,409
patients have a garden community garden

12
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,390
where neighbors can come and take the

13
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:38,159
food they need during the summer we have

14
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,719
coat drives and food drives we've

15
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:41,339
cleaned up the building that was

16
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:43,558
abandoned for almost a year by the

17
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,690
Eagles and have made it a beautiful

18
00:00:43,558 --> 00:00:48,030
place for people to come and gather and

19
00:00:45,689 --> 00:00:49,500
they want to say that the Clean Air Act

20
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:51,808
that you're not allowed to come and

21
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,299
gather with your friends and I will tell

22
00:00:51,808 --> 00:00:57,030
you the medical marijuana patients do

23
00:00:54,299 --> 00:00:59,669
not medicate in 10 minutes like a

24
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:01,739
cigarette smoker does so when you say to

25
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:04,349
a terminally ill person or a person with

26
00:01:01,738 --> 00:01:06,929
body pains and aches that I'm sorry now

27
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:09,509
you have to go outside and it's 42

28
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:12,299
degrees and it's raining and we want you

29
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:14,850
to power smoke down your joint so that

30
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:17,280
you don't hurt anymore I gotta say I'm

31
00:01:14,849 --> 00:01:20,579
sorry we're just not doing it i'm

32
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:24,180
holding a daily open act of civil

33
00:01:20,579 --> 00:01:26,459
disobedience at pd and because honestly

34
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:27,990
we got an outdoor smoking area and

35
00:01:26,459 --> 00:01:29,699
that's where the cigarette smokers go

36
00:01:27,989 --> 00:01:32,759
and I say to them don't let the door hit

37
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:34,170
you on the way out I also tell them if

38
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:37,319
you want to quit smoking I'll give you a

39
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:39,359
quarter ounce of pot a roller I pay a

40
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:41,039
pack of papers and every time you want

41
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:43,140
to smoke that cigarette you sit down and

42
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,850
you roll that joint and then you smoke

43
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:46,978
that cigarette all by yourself and guess

44
00:01:44,849 --> 00:01:49,709
what I have 12 to 16 people every year

45
00:01:46,978 --> 00:01:52,049
quit smoking cigarettes on my roll a

46
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:55,319
joint program for the last six years of

47
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:57,479
PGN so when you say to me I want you to

48
00:01:55,319 --> 00:02:00,089
go outside in the cold because we're

49
00:01:57,478 --> 00:02:02,218
worried about your secondhand smoke I'm

50
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:03,899
gonna say we're not gonna participate in

51
00:02:02,218 --> 00:02:06,000
that cuz when you would you say we're

52
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:07,259
gonna go outside they're not kind of let

53
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,788
you back in

54
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:12,610
just know it they're not going to let

55
00:02:09,788 --> 00:02:14,679
you back in once you give in don't give

56
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:17,080
up we have a beautiful outdoor smoking

57
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:19,930
area we do and it will continue to be

58
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:22,090
for cigarette smokers at the lodge as

59
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:24,189
long as possible and I know I'm probably

60
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:26,349
putting myself in jeopardy because it is

61
00:02:24,189 --> 00:02:29,800
a complaint based program at this point

62
00:02:26,349 --> 00:02:32,199
however if you let them push you outside

63
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:34,480
and push you back in the closet that's

64
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:36,609
where you'll be we fought long and hard

65
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:39,310
so that patients of dispensaries would

66
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:41,230
have the right to medicate many of them

67
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:43,449
can't work a four-hour shift without

68
00:02:41,229 --> 00:02:45,129
taking a 10 minute break to medicate it

69
00:02:43,449 --> 00:02:48,909
and now they got it you want him to

70
00:02:45,129 --> 00:02:51,389
drive home medicate and drive back no no

71
00:02:48,909 --> 00:02:54,340
also the targeting of our elderly

72
00:02:51,389 --> 00:02:56,708
cannabis patients for DUI I happen to

73
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:59,500
have a patient who got a DUI for a

74
00:02:56,709 --> 00:03:02,680
rolling stop at a stop sign because she

75
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:04,900
was taken to doff assert the utensil

76
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:07,150
that she smoked her medicine out of and

77
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:09,489
he arrested her right there on the spot

78
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:11,050
she didn't get a ticket for her pulling

79
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:13,659
stop she got a ticket cuz she had a bong

80
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:16,510
in the front seat of her car within the

81
00:03:13,659 --> 00:03:20,229
drivers reach she got a DUI she's 72

82
00:03:16,509 --> 00:03:22,298
years old she spent the night in jail in

83
00:03:20,229 --> 00:03:24,548
Dallas is not a friendly place so I'll

84
00:03:22,299 --> 00:03:27,040
just tell you you don't want to get get

85
00:03:24,549 --> 00:03:28,599
a DUI for marijuana in Dallas they don't

86
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:31,539
think she was not treated with respect

87
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:32,919
she was not treated with dignity and now

88
00:03:31,539 --> 00:03:34,689
she's in their system and being told

89
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:36,548
that she can't even Medicaid for 18

90
00:03:34,689 --> 00:03:38,979
months while she's on parole or

91
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:42,219
probation or whatever this class she's

92
00:03:38,979 --> 00:03:45,789
taken that's her medicine and she's

93
00:03:42,219 --> 00:03:48,569
being denied this is wrong on so many

94
00:03:45,789 --> 00:03:53,578
levels when you want to talk about

95
00:03:48,569 --> 00:03:56,709
compassion and caring and helping people

96
00:03:53,579 --> 00:03:59,170
they don't know they really don't know

97
00:03:56,709 --> 00:04:02,439
they don't have a clue you have 12

98
00:03:59,169 --> 00:04:04,899
people making the rules for 78,000

99
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:08,139
amazing people who need this medicine

100
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:10,989
