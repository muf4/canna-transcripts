1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,199
we still need a long way to go before

2
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:04,799
cannabis is treated like the relatively

3
00:00:03,198 --> 00:00:08,638
benign and harmless herb that we know it

4
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:10,559
to be how will we get there how will we

5
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:13,000
get to that point that place where we

6
00:00:10,558 --> 00:00:16,000
can live freely in peace without with

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,759
our plant that has so much to offer our

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,759
community how will we get to cannabis

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:25,960
Freedom well we will not get there be a

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,400
circular firing squads where we infight

11
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:30,839
and attack each other ignoring that the

12
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:33,239
root cause of our misery is prohibition

13
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:33,240
not each

14
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:40,199
other we will not get there by finger

15
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:42,640
pointing or insults or deing ourselves

16
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,640
at every

17
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,439
chance we will not get there by

18
00:00:46,119 --> 00:00:50,399
depending on our state legislators to

19
00:00:48,439 --> 00:00:52,519
protect us and protect our patients and

20
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:56,160
Empower our community to serve its

21
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:58,000
own we will not get there by expecting

22
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:59,639
the federal government to protect us

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,719
from the insanity and the Injustice and

24
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:05,879
the persecution of federal

25
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:08,359
prohibition cuz we know that prohibition

26
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:09,719
every single time treats us like

27
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:11,200
criminals it creates criminals where

28
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:13,759
they don't

29
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:16,000
exist we will not get there by Smashing

30
00:01:13,759 --> 00:01:19,280
windows and turning over cars and

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,280
lighting trash cans on

32
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:25,680
fire no our path has always been the can

33
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:30,519
perform movement's path has always been

34
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,520
and always will be the high road

35
00:01:30,769 --> 00:01:36,319
[Applause]

36
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:37,559
still we are stronger than prohibition

37
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:38,839
and what we're showing is that we're

38
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,280
stronger than the United States

39
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,478
government we're stronger than than the

40
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,280
strongest government in the history of

41
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:46,599
the world because we're changing it and

42
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:49,280
it's freedom and Justice and Liberty

43
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:49,280
that's making it

44
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:55,118
possible still we've been stereotyped

45
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,320
we've been scapegoated we've been

46
00:01:55,118 --> 00:02:01,118
targeted incarcerated stolen from denied

47
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:03,118
basic human dignities

48
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:05,438
and lumped in by our society with some

49
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:06,359
of the world's most dangerous criminals

50
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:10,159
and

51
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:12,318
most dysfunctional citizens in America

52
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:15,318
but we're not daunted we're a

53
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:15,318
steamroller

54
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:21,079
we're we are a tsunami of conviction and

55
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:24,840
determination we're in this for the long

56
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,840
ha this movement was built to

57
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:32,360
last we will we will get to our victory

58
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:34,639
by understanding the value of each other

59
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:36,360
by uplifting everyone around us by

60
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:39,639
embracing the values and principles of

61
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:41,599
unity and cooperation we will get there

62
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:43,759
by being a United Community despite our

63
00:02:41,598 --> 00:02:45,039
differences by King the common ground

64
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:47,079
that joins us in our struggle for

65
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:51,509
Liberty and Our Endless Quest to simply

66
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:54,640
be left alone when we're not harming

67
00:02:51,509 --> 00:02:57,079
[Applause]

68
00:02:54,639 --> 00:03:00,158
anyone we will get there by putting our

69
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:02,879
Focus not on personalities but on issues

70
00:03:00,158 --> 00:03:05,239
not by demonizing people but exposing

71
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:05,239
bad

72
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:11,319
policies we will get there because

73
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,560
everything is changing we are getting

74
00:03:11,318 --> 00:03:15,479
there we're waiting well we might be

75
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,759
experiencing a few steps forward and one

76
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:19,479
step back well we might be disappointed

77
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:21,798
by the setbacks and the speed bumps on

78
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:26,039
the path of Victory we are changing the

79
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:26,040
world right now before everybody

80
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:31,400
Li you know back when we started

81
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:34,039
when we started you know we did the

82
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:36,560
first march here in 99 but all the way

83
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:37,959
back in 91 we started the Hempfest and

84
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,519
of course this movement's been going on

85
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:43,000
much longer than that so many people

86
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:44,280
laughed at us they laughed they said

87
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,919
you'll never get there you're wasting

88
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,080
your time you're pissing in the wind

89
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:50,318
probic will always be there they're not

90
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,079
laughing at us anymore the same people

91
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:53,479
that said we' never do it are now

92
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:55,400
rushing to capitalize and make some

93
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:57,078
money off of this new thing because we

94
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:59,560
worked so

95
00:03:57,079 --> 00:04:02,239
hard we marched for workers rights so we

96
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:04,438
got them you marked for the vote for

97
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,959
women that he got it you marked for

98
00:04:04,438 --> 00:04:08,039
civil rights legislation that it

99
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:11,000
happened you marked for gay rights and

100
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:13,438
they're here we get to Vietnam and it

101
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,399
ended because history is often made in

102
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:18,319
the streets of America as fris Douglas

103
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:21,120
as Frederick Douglas noted in the runup

104
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:24,560
to the Civil War power concedes nothing

105
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:30,160
without a demand we demand our freedom

106
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:30,160
we equality we Justice

107
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:37,319
what we need to do resist oppose and

108
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:41,120
educate because we'll never be stopped

109
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:41,120
until Victory thank you so much
