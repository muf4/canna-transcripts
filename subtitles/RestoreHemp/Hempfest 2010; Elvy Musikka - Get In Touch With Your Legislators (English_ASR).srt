1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:06,318
Bringing up Elvie Musa, one of the only

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:08,240
living members of a government program.

3
00:00:06,318 --> 00:00:10,800
She gets marijuana from the federal

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:14,919
government in the mail each year. Elvie,

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,920
welcome to Salem Hempfest, darling.

6
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,800
We're back. We're back. We're back.

7
00:00:19,278 --> 00:00:23,600
And I'm looking forward to the day we

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:26,560
come back here to celebrate that laws at

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,640
last are a thing of the past when it

10
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:31,598
comes to our issue.

11
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,679
I wish it was as simple as just going uh

12
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:36,399
waiting for the mail. No, unfortunately

13
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:38,479
they make me go to Florida at least once

14
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:39,840
a year. Hang out there for a month or

15
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:41,558
two. It's at the height of winter. I

16
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,320
don't mind that too,

17
00:00:41,558 --> 00:00:46,718
guys. I get to pick up my marijuana

18
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,200
grown in Mississippi. Cannot be mailed

19
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:51,920
to me to Oregon. Even if I have doctors

20
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,399
here, I have there I have to go. Anyway,

21
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,160
we're all working on so many issues all

22
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,759
around the country. Rhode Island of

23
00:00:56,159 --> 00:01:00,519
course being the latest state that

24
00:00:57,759 --> 00:01:03,198
already has medical marijuana and has

25
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:06,478
dispensaries and they are very happy

26
00:01:03,198 --> 00:01:08,000
there. Yes, they are. We now have 15

27
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:10,000
states and when these elections are

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,640
over, no telling how many more. That's

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,799
right. Also, there are several things

30
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,478
going on with initiatives in my state of

31
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:19,840
Oregon. We don't have

32
00:01:17,478 --> 00:01:21,840
dispensaries and it's hard to find your

33
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:25,040
medicine when the mites get your

34
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:28,719
grower's crop or when for whatever

35
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,880
reason you just can't be found. Uh and

36
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:32,798
then if you're traveling, think of the

37
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:35,920
convenience of stopping somewhere, you

38
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:38,720
got your card with you, you can stop and

39
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:41,478
choose a medicine that will suit you for

40
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:44,560
that particular part of your

41
00:01:41,478 --> 00:01:46,239
journey. It's all very wonderful that we

42
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,719
get together. Now we got a good

43
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:51,239
administration and we got a holder who

44
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:53,920
we certainly have educated right here in

45
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:56,478
Seattle right all these years from the

46
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:59,519
justice department. He is uh handing out

47
00:01:56,478 --> 00:02:01,840
rules and making decisions for us. It's

48
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:04,158
more important than ever that we get in

49
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:08,118
touch with our legislators and see what

50
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:12,000
we can do. Time for hair.

51
00:02:08,118 --> 00:02:14,800
Um, we definitely passed it in Oregon so

52
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,520
that marijuana is a schedule two, not a

53
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:20,959
schedule one drug. So that's against the

54
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:23,760
uh the lie that we are propagating from

55
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:25,520
Mr. Nixon's time still onto now and

56
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:28,239
which could be wiped out with one

57
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,480
executive order. Your president needs to

58
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,959
hear from you. There are people trying

59
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:37,119
to help and Gasper on the radio has

60
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:39,199
gotten uh Ed Rosenthal to finance a

61
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,080
project in which some of the legal

62
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:43,839
smokers and I will go to Washington with

63
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,719
Marilyn Matrix which one of the

64
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,759
co-founders of patients out of time and

65
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:52,000
trying to explain to our legislators

66
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:54,000
that we cannot continue to uphold this

67
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,959
prohibition is causing too much pain,

68
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,120
too much heartache. There are so many

69
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:02,479
medicines right now that are being

70
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:05,200
patent using parts or some of marijuana.

71
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:08,399
Marijuana is medicine and everyone knows

72
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:11,199
that now. But the most exciting things

73
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,719
that are going on as Rick Sinum showed

74
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:16,560
us at the beginning of this year with

75
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:18,878
his tape run from the cure. However, now

76
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:22,080
there's a newer take that really goes

77
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:24,799
into all the leads about cancer and

78
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:28,560
cannabis and there is no way to ignore

79
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:30,879
this scientific evidence anymore. So, we

80
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,598
really need to present it and make it

81
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:36,158
clear to our legislators. We need our

82
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:38,798
health back. We don't need to have this

83
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:41,519
many cancers. We need to have plenty of

84
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:45,360
pure hemp seed oil like they do in

85
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:47,680
Finland. And cancer is prevented because

86
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:51,440
it leaves a coat protecting your immune

87
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:53,599
system. Manitoba here makes wonderful

88
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:56,799
non-narcotic hemp seed oil that we

89
00:03:53,598 --> 00:03:58,719
should also take. I am concerned about

90
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:01,760
California under new law. I would like

91
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:03,840
to see changes. However, when it puts so

92
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:06,639
many more restrictions on the bad laws

93
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,400
we already have, making them worse,

94
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:10,000
there's no way I could go for that. I'm

95
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,840
sorry.

96
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,318
Pay attention to what you're doing and

97
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,879
keep it moving. Keep it going strong.

98
00:04:14,318 --> 00:04:19,199
Remember that you are part of the

99
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:22,079
largest majority of people. That's

100
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:24,400
right. In the United States, there is no

101
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,960
segment in your community that doesn't

102
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:30,399
have pot smokers. Whether you only hang

103
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:32,159
out with judges, doctors, nurses, any

104
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:34,799
other professionals, or whether you

105
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,479
don't have a professional uh goal at

106
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,840
all, but you are an entrepreneur and you

107
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:41,039
do well with your life, or whether

108
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:43,359
you're doing nothing, chances are you

109
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,720
know people who smoke if you don't smoke

110
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,120
yourself.

111
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,440
Okay, it's time for me to leave you, but

112
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,199
I got to remind you that as I travel,

113
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:53,759
and I have done every state in the

114
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:56,759
United States and several countries. The

115
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:59,879
only opposition I ever find is from the

116
00:04:56,759 --> 00:05:02,919
pharmaceutical industries, the insurance

117
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:07,199
industries, and most of all, the

118
00:05:02,918 --> 00:05:09,599
corrupt prison system. Somebody misqued

119
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,600
me and said the press. I love the press.

120
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,759
They've always been good to me. It's the

121
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,400
prison. Let the true spirit of love

122
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:19,038
always be your guiding light. And I hope

123
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:22,159
next year we come to celebrate. Thank

124
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:26,360
you. Thank you, Vivian. Keep up the

125
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,360
music. Show your love.
