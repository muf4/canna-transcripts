1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,919
could you tell our audience a little bit

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:06,599
how how that came about and how you

3
00:00:04,919 --> 00:00:08,580
actually first taught Willie Nelson

4
00:00:06,599 --> 00:00:11,099
who's now a big proponent of biodiesel

5
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:13,080
about hemp bioaves we'd always heard

6
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:14,940
that Rudolph diesel had manufactured his

7
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,640
diesel engines run off sea dog we really

8
00:00:14,939 --> 00:00:21,358
didn't understand quite grasp that this

9
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:23,820
was in the early 90s uh late 80s and

10
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,560
then it fella from Nevada Las Vegas

11
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,660
Nevada came through town driving a

12
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:30,839
little Volkswagen diesel and he's

13
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:33,539
running it off Burger King oil and so we

14
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:35,939
had just uh derived some hip oil out of

15
00:00:33,539 --> 00:00:38,100
hemp seeds hemp seeds are 30 to 40

16
00:00:35,939 --> 00:00:40,259
percent oil by weight you got 100 pounds

17
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:43,020
of hemp seeds you can drive 30 to 40

18
00:00:40,259 --> 00:00:45,359
pounds of pure oil out of it and so we

19
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:47,520
had some of that and he tested it out in

20
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:49,558
his engine and he says this is the best

21
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:53,340
seed oil that I've ever driven this car

22
00:00:49,558 --> 00:00:55,859
on and so we had cedor When Willy came

23
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:57,960
in to do a benefit concert for me we

24
00:00:55,859 --> 00:01:00,359
poured that hemp oil into my Mercedes

25
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,039
diesel and drove it about 110 miles

26
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:04,198
across Kentucky

27
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:06,299
and it was the first time in I guess 50

28
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:08,280
to 60 years that any vehicle that had

29
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:11,100
been driven on Dent oil on the United

30
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:13,978
States roads but Willie told me later on

31
00:01:11,099 --> 00:01:16,199
that 12 years later actually no I mean

32
00:01:13,978 --> 00:01:18,599
now about 10 years later he says

33
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,460
Gatewood he says that afternoon we did

34
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:22,438
that it taught me what it was all about

35
00:01:20,459 --> 00:01:24,780
and that's the reason I started my

36
00:01:22,438 --> 00:01:26,399
biofuel company was from what we learned

37
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,540
that afternoon driving your Mercedes

38
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,280
across there

39
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:31,799
we're also smoking about the biggest

40
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,719
Hooters probably wrote in Kentucky at

41
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:36,960
the time and there was a caravan of us

42
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:39,840
we went from uh the Hyatt there and

43
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:42,599
rough Auditorium through Frankfurt the

44
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,780
state capitol which is about 80 miles

45
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:48,019
and then all together 120 miles all the

46
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:50,640
way into Louisville which is largest

47
00:01:48,019 --> 00:01:53,219
city in Kentucky and then he did a big

48
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,939
benefit concert for you there that night

49
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:55,938
that's right
