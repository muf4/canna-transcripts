2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,519
think about hemp hemp Industrial Hemp

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,240
see I think that the medical marijuana

4
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:12,798
movement will get a lot further if they

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:15,080
will reach out and help explain the

6
00:00:12,798 --> 00:00:19,118
realities of hemp the larger issue of

7
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:21,079
hemp hemp medical marijuana hemp hemp

8
00:00:19,118 --> 00:00:23,359
helps everybody hemp helps the earth

9
00:00:21,079 --> 00:00:25,518
hemp is Earth's medicine and I don't see

10
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:27,760
enough awareness being given to hemp as

11
00:00:25,518 --> 00:00:29,719
hemp we're too busy using the medical

12
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,279
marijuana for our own enjoyment and to

13
00:00:29,719 --> 00:00:33,519
help heal the pain and these different

14
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:36,079
things but we're ignoring hemp hemp will

15
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,719
help the planet practical reality if

16
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,239
we're going to talk about medicine all

17
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:41,439
right we're talking about medical

18
00:00:39,238 --> 00:00:43,718
marijuana as medicine for the people but

19
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:45,479
hemp is medicine for the Earth and if we

20
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:48,160
if we forget the Earth then we're only

21
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:52,159
going halfway there anyway that's just

22
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:54,279
some attitude all right hemp hemp

23
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:55,558
Industrial Hemp you can build your home

24
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:59,160
out of it you can make your clothes out

25
00:00:55,558 --> 00:01:01,399
of it and hemp and hemp the CBDs in hemp

26
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:03,319
all right are larger medic they serve a

27
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:06,159
larger medicinal purpose for the human

28
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:08,239
body than even the THC does and people

29
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:09,560
need to kind of look at this because

30
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:10,920
we're talking about diabetes we're

31
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,960
talking about epilepsy we're talking

32
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,719
about cancer It's very effective against

33
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:16,679
breast cancer all right we're talking

34
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:18,640
about a real deal here but nobody's

35
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,840
paying any attention to it all the

36
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,599
attention is being put to the THC aspect

37
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,040
and I think it's time to recognize the

38
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:29,239
entire

39
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:29,240
plant for the Earth for us okay
