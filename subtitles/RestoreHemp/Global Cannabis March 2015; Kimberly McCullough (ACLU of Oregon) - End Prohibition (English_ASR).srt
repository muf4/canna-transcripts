5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,359
I'm the legislative director with the

6
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,440
ACLU of Oregon I want to tell you a

7
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:16,320
little bit about the ACLU before I get

8
00:00:14,439 --> 00:00:18,879
into everything else just so you know

9
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,039
because not everybody does um ACLU has

10
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:23,000
been around for over a hundred years

11
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:24,720
we've been on the front lines of pretty

12
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,359
much every civil rights and civil

13
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:30,160
liberties issue in the country um we're

14
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,359
nonpartisan nonprofit organization we

15
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:35,558
work on Free Speech racial racial

LGBT rights immigrant rights and much

20
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,000
much more we believe these rights are

21
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,600
fundamental to a free society and that's

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,399
why we fight every day across the

23
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:55,280
country in the courts and in the

24
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:56,520
legislator legislator and Al also

25
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,399
through public

26
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:02,760
education as I'm sure you all agree the

27
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:04,680
war on on marijuana is a failure it has

28
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:06,118
needlessly ens snared hundreds of

29
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:09,520
thousands of people in the criminal

30
00:01:06,118 --> 00:01:12,159
justice system at a tremendous cost more

31
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:15,199
than half of all drug related offenses

32
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:17,320
in the state of Oregon are for marijuana

33
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,640
over the last decade Oregon police have

34
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:22,758
arrested and cited more than

35
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:24,920
95,000 oregonians for marijuana

36
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:26,959
possession that's the equivalent of

37
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:30,118
arresting or sighting every single

38
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:34,319
person in the entire city of Hillsboro

39
00:01:30,118 --> 00:01:36,640
in 2010 we spent over $50 million

40
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:40,158
enforcing marijuana

41
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:43,200
laws what's more the war on marijuana

42
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:45,200
has been enforced along color lines even

43
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,040
though black and white oregonians use

44
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:50,240
marijuana at about the same rate black

45
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:52,200
oregonians are roughly two times more

46
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:54,560
likely to be cited or arrested for

47
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,478
marijuana offenses and some areas of

48
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:00,000
Oregon are actually even worse than that

49
00:01:56,478 --> 00:02:02,920
in Lane County it's 3.5 times more

50
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,078
likely for doing the same thing at the

51
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:09,199
same rate as everybody

52
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:11,479
else last November Oregon voters said

53
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:12,958
enough is enough our money and resources

54
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:15,280
should be spent on measures that

55
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,519
actually keep our communities safe like

56
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,000
investing in investigating serious

57
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:22,959
crimes and reinvesting in public health

58
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
programs including drug treatment rather

59
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:27,039
than wasting time and money clogging our

60
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,280
courts and jails and destroying lives

61
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:32,639
and families the people of Oregon voted

62
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:35,640
to Legal ize and regulate marijuana at

63
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:38,318
the same time what the voters absolutely

64
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:41,199
did not say is let's throw medical

65
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:44,079
marijuana users under the

66
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:44,799
bus people who are sick need access to

67
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,159
their

68
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:51,140
medication let me say that again people

69
00:02:47,158 --> 00:02:52,359
who are sick need access to their

70
00:02:51,139 --> 00:02:55,000
[Applause]

71
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:57,080
medication the ACLU was right there with

72
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,400
you fighting for the medical marijuana

73
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:01,000
program and we will continue to fight to

74
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:05,760
protect

75
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:09,519
it yeah the voters also did not say

76
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:12,039
endanger our privacy and over regulate

77
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:14,599
marijuana yet some of the proposals that

78
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:16,598
have been made in the Oregon legislature

79
00:03:14,598 --> 00:03:19,158
this session would do just that if

80
00:03:16,598 --> 00:03:21,079
enacted into law as the legislative

81
00:03:19,158 --> 00:03:23,079
director for the ACLU I'm down in the

82
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:25,640
capital every day I've been fighting

83
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:28,159
very very hard to ensure the privacy of

84
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:31,158
our medical patients the privacy of our

85
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:33,158
recreational users and to make sure that

86
00:03:31,158 --> 00:03:35,560
these new regulations don't just simply

87
00:03:33,158 --> 00:03:38,158
create another method of criminalizing

88
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:41,319
marijuana

89
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:43,719
use I'm also absolutely dedicated to

90
00:03:41,318 --> 00:03:45,359
work with representative Frederick um

91
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:47,680
and anybody else who wants to get

92
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,720
involved to expunge all nonviolent

93
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,640
marijuana related convictions from

94
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:55,359
Oregon

95
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:58,279
residents it makes absolutely no sense

96
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,720
to legalize marijuana and not clear the

97
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:03,519
records of people with marijuana

98
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:05,919
offenses no Oregonian should be serving

99
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,719
time in prison for marijuana and no

100
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:10,039
Oregonian should have to suffer the

101
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:14,199
collateral consequences of having a

102
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:14,199
conviction for marijuana for one more

103
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:22,519
day I want to tell you now unequivocally

104
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:25,280
your voice is extremely important and

105
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:28,079
it's very powerful in Salem when I'm

106
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:30,399
down in the capital I hear legislators

107
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:32,639
regularly talk about the Communications

108
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:34,359
that they get from the people of Oregon

109
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,199
it actually does make a difference when

110
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,919
you sit down and write a letter

111
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:41,000
particularly when you write it in your

112
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:43,639
own words so please look up your

113
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,839
legislators look them up online email

114
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:48,400
them tell them what you think tell them

115
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:51,159
to enact fair and safe guidelines for

116
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:52,719
measure 91 and hold them accountable

117
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:54,560
tell them the honor the will of the

118
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,919
voters who said it was time for a new

119
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,759
approach to marijuana to honor the

120
00:04:56,918 --> 00:05:02,198
privacy of oregonians who use marijuana

121
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:05,199
to expunge marijuana convictions and to

122
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:05,199
protect the medical

123
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:10,758
program I also just I have to do this I

124
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:13,759
want to encourage you to support the

125
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:16,400
ACLU we need your support um membership

126
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:18,720
is as little as $5 for students it's

127
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:23,560
really easy to do just look us up online

128
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,560
ACLU of Oregon that helps make our voice

129
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:28,959
stronger we will continue to fight this

130
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:32,120
fight because we believe the criminal

131
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:34,439
justice system is broken we want to end

132
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:36,840
not just the war on marijuana but the

133
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:39,560
War on Drugs more

134
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:41,839
generally the drug war has failed to

135
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:44,319
improve Public Safety and Health it's

136
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:47,679
placed an unprecedented number of people

137
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:50,039
behind bar bars and it's severely eroded

138
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,639
our constitutional rights all that

139
00:05:50,038 --> 00:05:54,599
search and seizure law all of those ways

140
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,400
that the government invades our privacy

141
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:58,720
so much of that has been done in the

142
00:05:56,399 --> 00:06:00,879
name of Fighting the War on Drugs

143
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:04,600
instead of actually helping the American

144
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:07,639
people so together I believe we can end

145
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:09,800
the drug war we can reverse the tide of

146
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:14,160
mass incarceration and protect our

147
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:14,160
constitutional rights thank you
