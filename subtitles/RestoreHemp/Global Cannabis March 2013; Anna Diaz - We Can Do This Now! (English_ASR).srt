1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:04,040
because you know as we all know um

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:05,480
alcohol prohibition didn't really end

3
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:06,640
until the women got involved and I

4
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:10,120
believe that's true for cannabis

5
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:12,080
prohibition too so I although I'm not

6
00:00:10,119 --> 00:00:14,439
speaking just to the women today I

7
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,118
really uh strongly suggest that it's

8
00:00:14,439 --> 00:00:17,358
time for women to step up and stand next

9
00:00:16,118 --> 00:00:19,359
to our brothers who have been fighting

10
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,519
this fight for 40 years it's time for it

11
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:24,199
to end people may not know it but

12
00:00:21,518 --> 00:00:26,118
cannabis prohibition is over it's over

13
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:27,800
it's just a matter of time and I keep

14
00:00:26,118 --> 00:00:31,399
hearing these large organizations tell

15
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:34,239
us to wait till 2014 wait till

16
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:37,840
2016 I'm tired of my brothers and

17
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:40,280
sisters getting put in jail I'm tired of

18
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,440
kids being taken from their families

19
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:47,280
because they choose to use a perfectly

20
00:00:42,439 --> 00:00:51,000
safe intoxicant after work I am tired of

21
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:53,640
being scrutinized for using a benign

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,640
plant as my way to relax in the evening

23
00:00:53,640 --> 00:01:00,198
and I don't want to wait till

24
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:03,600
2014 I don't want to wait till 2016 so I

25
00:01:00,198 --> 00:01:06,438

26
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:10,719

27
00:01:06,438 --> 00:01:13,919

00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:25,199
the law

54
00:02:23,318 --> 00:02:28,318

00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:29,359
wait till MPP says we can do it in 2016

56

59
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:38,640
to do is call that's all it won't take a

60
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,959
huge amount of us to make those calls to

61
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:42,919
make this happen because they take the

62
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,598
impact of those phone calls as being the

63
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:47,679
voice of 20 of us so imagine that people

64
