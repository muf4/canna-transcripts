1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:06,040
you know we should believe less and

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:08,798
think more right well anyway if you

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,798
don't think about

4
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:14,518
it well believe when we say I believe

5
00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:15,839
I'm not trying to start any but

6
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:18,278
when we say I

7
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,320
believe actually we're really saying I

8
00:00:18,278 --> 00:00:22,320
don't

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,679
know but we're not going to go out and

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,079
say I don't know this I don't know that

11
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:26,198
so we're going to go say I believe this

12
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:28,759
I believe

13
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:30,199
that but I think we need to really think

14
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,320
about thinking rather than than

15
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:34,399
believing all thing everything is energy

16
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,039
energy flows that's the way it is

17
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:38,799
thinking is energy it flows but believe

18
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:40,759
is a container so when you take the

19
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:42,359
energy of flow the flowing energy of

20
00:00:40,759 --> 00:00:44,399
thinking and put it in the container of

21
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:46,079
believing it's got nowhere to go so it

22
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,439
just kind of intensifies inside the

23
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,000
container and creates all this stress

24
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:51,878
and freak out

25
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,119
think more believe less all right

26
00:00:51,878 --> 00:00:54,119
that's

27
00:00:55,679 --> 00:01:01,920
the I don't know where it came from but

28
00:00:58,119 --> 00:01:01,919
