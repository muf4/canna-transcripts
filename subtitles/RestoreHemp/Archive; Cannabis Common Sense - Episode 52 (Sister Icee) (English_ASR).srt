00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:54,539
edition of cannabis common sense our

00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:56,250
show is a production of our political

13
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:59,039
committee the campaign for the

14
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:02,280
restoration and regulation of hip

15
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:05,308
we are circulating a petition the Oregon

16
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:08,340
cannabis Tax Act and I would now like to

17
00:01:05,308 --> 00:01:10,099
introduce my fellow chief petitioner our

18
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:12,630
political committees attorney our

19
00:01:10,099 --> 00:01:15,478
treasurer and the president of the

20
00:01:12,629 --> 00:01:15,658
Oregon Wildlife Federation mr. pollow

21
00:01:15,478 --> 00:01:17,609
nee

22
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:21,770
well thanks Paul for that fine

23
00:01:17,609 --> 00:01:23,969
introduction yeah our initiative was a

24
00:01:21,769 --> 00:01:26,069
comprehensive initiative which would

25
00:01:23,969 --> 00:01:30,060
regulate marijuana and a comprehensive

26
00:01:26,069 --> 00:01:32,219
system obviously it would allow the sale

27
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:35,370
to adults of marijuana through state

28
00:01:32,219 --> 00:01:37,408
liquor stores for profit tax go into the

29
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:40,920
state coffers to cut our state income

30
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:43,530
tax and it would allow at cost sales of

31
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:45,540
medical marijuana to patients with a

32
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:49,200
doctor's prescription or allow our

33
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:52,200
farmers to grow industrial hemp the low

34
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:55,520
THC variety to provide all sorts of

35
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:58,740
products of the fiber fued food fuel and

36
00:01:55,519 --> 00:02:01,618
it would some of the proceeds would go

37
00:01:58,739 --> 00:02:04,379
into drug education programs realistic

38
00:02:01,618 --> 00:02:06,930
ones not the phony Dare ones that don't

39
00:02:04,379 --> 00:02:08,878
work and it would also go into treatment

40
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:11,129
programs which are desperately needed

41
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:15,090
it's say like I say it's a comprehensive

42
00:02:11,128 --> 00:02:17,878
system it's you know a way to end the

43
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:20,848
prohibition this that's destroying our

44
00:02:17,878 --> 00:02:23,759
way of life destroying our democracy and

45
00:02:20,848 --> 00:02:27,688
it's just causing tragedy to families

46
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:29,969
you know we can save untold millions of

47
00:02:27,688 --> 00:02:32,340
dollars in tax revenue that's spent

48
00:02:29,969 --> 00:02:34,348
today on incarcerated marijuana

49
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:36,989
offenders locking up marijuana growers

50
00:02:34,348 --> 00:02:39,568
we can bring in hundreds of millions of

51
00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:41,340
dollars in revenue for Oregon state

52
00:02:39,568 --> 00:02:44,369
coffers which is going to lower

53
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:46,500
the tax burden on us all when we tax and

54
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:48,810

55

00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:31,468
you saw a wide range of products

136
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:34,229

138
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:38,788
large library

139
00:06:35,598 --> 00:06:43,490
everything from information on him and

140
00:06:38,788 --> 00:06:45,449
its uses in industry to grow books to

141
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:47,519
enable people to grow their own

142
00:06:45,449 --> 00:06:50,069
marijuana hmm

143
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:52,649
have any problems with robux some girl

144
00:06:50,069 --> 00:06:57,060
books here it hasn't been a problem I've

145
00:06:52,649 --> 00:06:59,879
managed the store for a good good time

146
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:01,560
now and we've never you know the police

147
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:04,288
have never given us any problems about

148
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:07,319
it so actually an in the raid in

149
00:07:04,288 --> 00:07:10,168
December they left the grow books alone

150
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:12,278
and such when they you know took new

151
00:07:10,168 --> 00:07:14,468
paraphernalia and see it's a

152
00:07:12,278 --> 00:07:16,509
they left the books alone so I guess

153
00:07:14,468 --> 00:07:17,798
it's not a concern but the rate in

154
00:07:16,509 --> 00:07:19,838
December that was the second rate

155
00:07:17,798 --> 00:07:22,628
they've been won some time before right

156
00:07:19,838 --> 00:07:26,079
yeah chamber of 97 was the second one

157
00:07:22,629 --> 00:07:28,119
right the first one was January 96 and

158
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:32,288
they did basically the same thing came

159
00:07:28,119 --> 00:07:34,239
in on mass and closed the store stole

160
00:07:32,288 --> 00:07:37,959
pipes bombs what they consider to be

161
00:07:34,238 --> 00:07:42,488
paraphernalia seeds and in this raid

162
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:44,619

163
00:07:42,488 --> 00:07:47,228

166
00:07:50,949 --> 00:07:55,028
for our rights yeah and you know that's

167
00:07:53,228 --> 00:07:56,588
what we consider that we do here and

168
00:07:55,028 --> 00:07:58,088
that's a large part of what we do is we

169
00:07:56,588 --> 00:08:00,309
are fighting for individual rights and

170
00:07:58,088 --> 00:08:03,249
freedoms and we believe that it's

171
00:08:00,309 --> 00:08:05,679
everybody's own choice you know how they

172
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:08,889
choose to live within you know certain

173
00:08:05,678 --> 00:08:12,218
confines that society dictates and as a

174
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:14,918
pot smoker I can honestly say I'm not

175
00:08:12,218 --> 00:08:16,019
hurting anybody by my habit if you'd

176
00:08:14,918 --> 00:08:18,248
like to call it that

177
00:08:16,019 --> 00:08:20,528
certainly I'm productive and

178
00:08:18,249 --> 00:08:24,219
contributing to society in my estimation

179
00:08:20,528 --> 00:08:26,499
so yeah and it seems to me a said Oh act

180
00:08:24,218 --> 00:08:28,058
of civil disobedience you know it's like

181
00:08:26,499 --> 00:08:29,889
when you got no other choice but you

182
00:08:28,059 --> 00:08:31,419
still have to live your life what you do

183
00:08:29,889 --> 00:08:32,799
this is it yeah and then you come to a

184
00:08:31,418 --> 00:08:35,049
point in your life where you decide if

185
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,378
it's important enough something to fight

186
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:38,038
for

187
00:08:35,379 --> 00:08:40,490
and I certainly consider

188
00:08:38,038 --> 00:08:43,370
you know that's what I do here and so

189
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:47,339
will you hear the the day of the

190
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:48,810
December 97 bust yes when they came in I

191
00:08:47,339 --> 00:08:51,120
certainly want to talk about that it's

192
00:08:48,809 --> 00:08:53,669
always kind of interesting to me anyway

193
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,620
to hear what happens when they come in I

194
00:08:53,669 --> 00:09:00,059
guess this was a unprepped they came in

195
00:08:55,620 --> 00:09:01,919
with like albinius like 25 it's really

196
00:09:00,059 --> 00:09:03,778
it was really quite ridiculous you know

197
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:06,419
and when you could stand back and look

198
00:09:03,778 --> 00:09:09,568
at what was actually going on there were

199
00:09:06,419 --> 00:09:11,189
20 25 officers that came in with a

200
00:09:09,568 --> 00:09:17,068
search warrant in time of day was this

201
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:19,800
it was just about 420 that was kind of

202
00:09:17,068 --> 00:09:21,838
auspicious in any case they came in with

203
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:23,969
the search warrant and read the search

204
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:27,120
warrant to my system assistant Tamara

205
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:29,879
and and that stated that they were there

206
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:34,350
to confiscate illegal paraphernalia for

207
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:36,028
illicit drug use and that and they

208
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:37,560
proceeded kind of they took the names of

209
00:09:36,028 --> 00:09:39,028
the customers that were here there quite

210
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:42,000
a number of customers in the store it

211
00:09:39,028 --> 00:09:45,000
was a nice afternoon and let them leave

212
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,860
and finally stopped a mirror for making

213
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,909
sale she was ringing in sales all the

214
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:51,539
time they were

215
00:09:48,909 --> 00:09:53,949
then again it was really quite funny and

216
00:09:51,539 --> 00:09:56,219
he got particulars from all the staff

217
00:09:53,950 --> 00:10:00,330
members and then they were told to leave

218
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:03,279
I hung around until Mark got here and

219
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:04,509
after a little while they escorted us

220
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:06,039
out as well apparently you're not

221
00:10:04,509 --> 00:10:10,840
allowed to stay on premises while

222
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:13,539
they're skating there's a large diverse

223
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:15,910
nation kind of gathering during this and

224
00:10:13,539 --> 00:10:18,039
everybody went outside and waited and as

225
00:10:15,909 --> 00:10:20,319
the crowd grew and grew it was really

226
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:22,299
quite reassuring actually to see the

227
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:25,600
support that we gathered in such a short

228
00:10:22,299 --> 00:10:28,569
time you know it grew to about I'm not

229
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,879
even sure maybe 300 people I'm standing

230
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:33,040
very peaceably his plot smokers tend to

231
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:35,110
do you know around the police tape that

232
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:36,610
had been put up and so it's kind of

233
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:38,080
blocking out in the street or was it

234
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:40,690
just on the sidewalk I know we spilled

235
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:41,560
over into Hastings absolutely yeah but

236
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:44,200
that's because they wouldn't let us

237
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:47,769
stand on it had a growth dog stopping

238
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:49,120
traffic on Hastings yeah yeah yeah so

239
00:10:47,769 --> 00:10:52,090
how did the word get out for all those

240
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,500
people to show up we actually got on the

241
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:55,690
phone as soon as the police came and

242
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:58,600
started calling the local media and such

243
00:10:55,690 --> 00:11:00,160
and for the area and the people who came

244
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:02,240
out on foot it's just that the numbers

245
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:06,230
in the area who do support NBC

246
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:08,930
we do here so what are some others

247
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:10,070
fellow store offers as per providers on

248
00:11:08,929 --> 00:11:12,679
the street here where do they think of

249
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:15,020
your business they actually were

250
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:17,509
interviewed after the last trade for

251
00:11:15,019 --> 00:11:19,778
that reason and most of what I heard or

252
00:11:17,509 --> 00:11:22,909
actually saw on TV was very favorable

253
00:11:19,778 --> 00:11:25,159
they agree that NBC is a good thing on

254
00:11:22,909 --> 00:11:28,850
this block we certainly have kept the

255
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:30,679
the hard drug users the other side of

256
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:32,149
candy Street just because we attract so

257
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:35,028
much attention there's always people

258
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:36,740
coming and going and traffic and we're

259
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:39,009
good for business and we attract a lot

260
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:41,629
of people to this block

261
00:11:39,009 --> 00:11:45,080
HEVC is an extremely busy retail store

262
00:11:41,629 --> 00:11:47,620
and so you know all in all we're very

263
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:49,700
good for them and they have said as much

264
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:51,709
that's good to have support from your

265
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:54,500
neighbors I heard when this first opened

266
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:59,689
it was boarded up and maybe burned out

267
00:11:54,500 --> 00:12:03,049
or something perhaps across the road

268
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:06,370
yeah the first store was an old boarded

269
00:12:03,049 --> 00:12:16,219
up some kind of bookstore alternative

270
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:18,320
something I can ask my so do you also

271
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:20,300
sell hydroponic equipment and other

272
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,670
things like that no we don't any longer

273
00:12:20,299 --> 00:12:24,169
that was the little gray shop that that

274
00:12:22,669 --> 00:12:27,379
was here when Mark owned the business

275
00:12:24,169 --> 00:12:29,689
um that's closed down that's closed as

276
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:31,669
well as mark Emery seed sales are no

277
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:35,720
longer on premises here we're not

278
00:12:31,669 --> 00:12:38,958
affiliated any longer and so what we do

279
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:43,790
have is the our big beautiful store yeah

280
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:45,649
and it is very so he understand their

281
00:12:43,789 --> 00:12:47,750
licensing problems and they they said

282
00:12:45,649 --> 00:12:50,809
they weren't gonna date of licenses

283
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:52,129
mm-hmm what City Councilor City Hall had

284
00:12:50,809 --> 00:12:55,159
said to Marcus that they weren't going

285
00:12:52,129 --> 00:12:59,129
to renew his business license for this

286
00:12:55,159 --> 00:13:01,139
year I'm sure totally

287
00:12:59,129 --> 00:13:04,769
motivated by you know whatever that's

288
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:06,840
it's happened and so what Mark decided

289
00:13:04,769 --> 00:13:09,090
to do instead of loose or risk losing

290
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:10,230
the whole business because he would have

291
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:11,970
been you know operating without a

292
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:15,420
license and such I'm not sure you know

293
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:17,160
how far that authority extends but it

294
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:19,860
would be better to divest himself of

295
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:23,309
these particular Holdings and in that

296
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:27,360
way we were able to retain I think about

297
00:13:23,309 --> 00:13:29,789
21 of the former 35 full-time employees

298
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:32,669
of Hamelin EC the other 14 of course

299
00:13:29,789 --> 00:13:37,319
lost their jobs they were casualties of

300
00:13:32,669 --> 00:13:39,089
this drug war and and so yeah employment

301
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:41,760
was spawned in the growth store and our

302
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:43,320
wholesale business closed down so but

303
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:45,389
this way you know there's still a lot of

304
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:47,700
us working and that's good so that's

305
00:13:45,389 --> 00:13:50,669
good yeah you know we're from Oregon in

306
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:54,180
Oregon when the they've really cracked

307
00:13:50,669 --> 00:13:56,699
down we used to kind of be the cannabis

308
00:13:54,179 --> 00:13:58,679
center of the west coast until the 80s

309
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:01,350
and the federal government started

310
00:13:58,679 --> 00:14:04,469
enforcing federal laws in local areas

311
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:06,450
and people are being incarcerated for

312
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:09,080
really long periods of time and police

313
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:12,120
are using infrared detection to find

314
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:15,480
halide lights and grow operations and we

315
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:17,220
like to tell people about that what's

316
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:21,870
going on here in Vancouver where now

317
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:24,480
that then Vancouver has been the center

318
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:28,580
of freedom here at least when it comes

319
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:31,500
to cannabis of the Western North America

320
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:34,680
as far as police efforts go I mean the

321
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:36,720
police are always talking about you know

322
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:39,989
looking at looking out for the big

323
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:41,730
growers the commercial Brewers the the

324
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:44,610
people like that who they assume are all

325
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:46,920
bikers and what I know is that a lot of

326
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:49,620
people in Vancouver grow pot for their

327
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:51,479
own consumption they may have one room

328
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:53,460
in their house where they have a light

329
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:57,240
and they have some marijuana plants

330
00:14:53,460 --> 00:15:01,070
growing and and that I think is the the

331

to our interview with sister IC from

413
00:18:33,049 --> 00:18:43,009
hemp bc up in Vancouver BC isn't she

414
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:44,509
great it's a very same person larger

415
00:18:43,009 --> 00:18:46,480
than our city Portland and Portland

416
00:18:44,509 --> 00:18:49,970
there they're doing several a day

417
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:53,089
several a day they have to do property

418
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:53,858
seizures and rocking home seizures and

419
00:18:53,089 --> 00:18:56,269
things like

420
00:18:53,858 --> 00:18:58,968
conjunction with it do they do that the

421
00:18:56,269 --> 00:19:02,179
property seizure here in Canada actually

422
00:18:58,969 --> 00:19:06,169
with the passage of a bill of C eight

423
00:19:02,179 --> 00:19:08,359
last year they do now have they can

424
00:19:06,169 --> 00:19:12,139
apply to do that they can apply to have

425
00:19:08,358 --> 00:19:14,089
property seized it's never actually been

426
00:19:12,138 --> 00:19:16,248
tried so I think there was a case of

427
00:19:14,089 --> 00:19:17,689
Victoria where there was a house seized

428
00:19:16,249 --> 00:19:20,389
and what they have to do now is apply

429
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:22,249
there to keep it is anything away from

430
00:19:20,388 --> 00:19:24,949
the other but again it's not been tested

431
00:19:22,249 --> 00:19:27,079
so let's see so it's just being

432
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:30,379
implemented yes

433
00:19:27,079 --> 00:19:32,509
we'll see if Canadians yeah hopefully

434
00:19:30,378 --> 00:19:33,199
not supposed to have to have a line here

435
00:19:32,509 --> 00:19:34,969
needs work

436
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,519
you know if property taken right and

437
00:19:34,969 --> 00:19:39,769
left in our country so like I say it's a

438
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:41,989
good service obedience we don't know you

439
00:19:39,769 --> 00:19:45,440
know breathe the law I don't want to

440
00:19:41,989 --> 00:19:47,149
change it just have to live your life it

441
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,278
really corrupts the criminal justice

442
00:19:47,148 --> 00:19:51,378
system as well because the police are

443
00:19:49,278 --> 00:19:52,878
going after property they don't you know

444
00:19:51,378 --> 00:19:54,978
they're really looking and making

445
00:19:52,878 --> 00:19:57,408
decisions on how much money they can

446
00:19:54,979 --> 00:19:58,969
make and doing positive there's one

447
00:19:57,409 --> 00:20:00,589
horror story that one of our guests a

448
00:19:58,969 --> 00:20:02,899
few months back

449
00:20:00,588 --> 00:20:06,908
forfeiture attorney Constance Krueger

450
00:20:02,898 --> 00:20:06,908
was talking about one of her clients was

451
00:20:07,269 --> 00:20:11,058
arrested for growing marijuana and they

452
00:20:09,409 --> 00:20:16,009
took everything took his refrigerator

453
00:20:11,058 --> 00:20:18,259
and stoves TVs his furniture and then

454
00:20:16,009 --> 00:20:20,419
they charged him in federal court where

455
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:23,389
he was facing an incredibly long prison

456
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:25,999
sentence and he committed suicide and

457
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:28,189
his family went to get you know some of

458
00:20:25,999 --> 00:20:30,409
his belongings back or the police said

459
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:33,169
they wanted to keep this refrigerator

460
00:20:30,409 --> 00:20:35,380
and microwave for their office and so

461
00:20:33,169 --> 00:20:39,580
that's what they did well

462
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:41,710
yeah for shame yeah so that's really the

463
00:20:39,579 --> 00:20:43,720
situation in our country unfortunately

464
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:46,710
it's a shame that our government's

465
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:50,679
pressuring years to try to make it where

466
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:55,210
fascism creeps here as well yes and it's

467
00:20:50,679 --> 00:20:57,429
becoming embarassingly obvious so here

468
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:58,840
we are you know doing what we can then

469
00:20:57,429 --> 00:21:00,669
yeah we're gonna stop it

470
00:20:58,839 --> 00:21:01,629
yeah well that's immense while they look

471
00:21:00,669 --> 00:21:03,910
like your store here you're getting

472
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:05,980
information out to people so they can

473
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:08,110
use it you know how to you know grow the

474
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:11,319
plants that they want you know the uses

475
00:21:08,109 --> 00:21:13,990
of plants they can buy products made

476
00:21:11,319 --> 00:21:15,490
from a plant this is just such an active

477
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:17,380
so there's a being it's right there

478
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:20,079
almost is telling people something that

479
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:21,789
they don't know we have to educate you

480
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:23,288
know that's the only way I think it's

481
00:21:21,788 --> 00:21:25,869
the only way to change all this is to

482
00:21:23,288 --> 00:21:27,819
make people more informed and to show

483
00:21:25,869 --> 00:21:30,038
them where the lies of being told to

484
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:31,569
them all these years you know it's just

485
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:35,259
we've got to stop believing everything

486
00:21:31,569 --> 00:21:38,619
we're fed by the Machine I just have to

487
00:21:35,259 --> 00:21:41,259
stop yeah yeah it's great that you can

488
00:21:38,619 --> 00:21:42,489
take over the business here and help

489
00:21:41,259 --> 00:21:47,379
when did you take over the business

490
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:48,460

00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:59,860
and yeah I really want to live up

495
00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:02,169
yeah that's a good challenge so if you

496
00:21:59,859 --> 00:22:04,928
got any that ran plans for how do you

497
00:22:02,169 --> 00:22:06,940
want to see the story evolve and we're

498
00:22:04,929 --> 00:22:08,679
just gonna keep growing we're just gonna

499
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:12,009
keep growing and keep providing people

500
00:22:08,679 --> 00:22:13,690
with with what they want and we're just

501
00:22:12,009 --> 00:22:15,519
gonna see how it goes I mean I'm not a

502
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:18,120
firm believer in making very concrete

503
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:21,159
plans I think things are a little more

504
00:22:18,119 --> 00:22:22,959
kind of unstable than that but so we're

505
00:22:21,159 --> 00:22:25,179
just gonna keep going on and then doing

506
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:29,519
what we know is right in that I don't

507
00:22:25,179 --> 00:22:32,499
think we're gonna feel so it's good yeah

508
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:34,509
yeah I just this is kind of neat that

509
00:22:32,499 --> 00:22:37,450
you've knit be able to do this when the

510
00:22:34,509 --> 00:22:40,868
city fathers mothers daily giving you

511
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:43,240
permission the proper policeman yeah no

512
00:22:40,868 --> 00:22:48,189
not yet we I have applied for a business

513
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:52,118
license probably not enough time for

514
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:54,610
issue of it exactly you know yes those

515
00:22:52,118 --> 00:22:56,618
wheels turn slow like there was some

516
00:22:54,609 --> 00:22:59,548
concern from the people at City Hall

517
00:22:56,618 --> 00:23:01,990
about seed sales and the grouse star

518
00:22:59,548 --> 00:23:03,819
both of which you know I've assured them

519
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:05,409
that both are gone and they won't be

520
00:23:03,819 --> 00:23:08,528
back here and I hope that just

521
00:23:05,409 --> 00:23:09,820
alleviates their concerns but we haven't

522
00:23:08,528 --> 00:23:14,378
heard back as yet so we're waiting

523
00:23:09,819 --> 00:23:16,329
patiently the the licensing inspector

524
00:23:14,378 --> 00:23:18,699

527
00:23:20,829 --> 00:23:23,669
VC

it's being processed so so you know

530
00:23:26,009 --> 00:23:30,150
we're confident that we can continue to

531
00:23:28,009 --> 00:23:32,759
open our doors every day do some

532
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:34,470
business you know sorry did I give your

533
00:23:32,759 --> 00:23:40,759
timetable of when they might decide no

534
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:43,259
no secret probation they have you on

535
00:23:40,759 --> 00:23:45,390
double-secret probation

536
00:23:43,259 --> 00:23:51,329
no we're behaving ourselves so I don't

537
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:54,540
foresee any problems well good it's

538
00:23:51,329 --> 00:23:56,069
pretty unusual I haven't ever been the

539
00:23:54,539 --> 00:23:59,159
Amsterdam that's pretty unusual to come

540
00:23:56,069 --> 00:24:01,439
in let's see people openly smoking in an

541
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:08,009
establishment that's really cool I think

542
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:12,630
Rick Lee myself but what's that like

543
00:24:08,009 --> 00:24:13,920
yeah you know pretty you don't I don't

544
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:16,590
think there's any place else here on

545
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:18,840
this continent that you can see that and

546
00:24:16,589 --> 00:24:22,199
I want to congratulate you for helping

547

pioneer this well thank you and I have a

548
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:26,610
lot of brave souls upstairs you know and

549
00:24:24,599 --> 00:24:29,039
again they're all doing what they think

550
00:24:26,609 --> 00:24:31,548
is right you know Marc Emery said

551
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:33,378
something a time that really stuck

552
00:24:31,548 --> 00:24:35,839
that is if you want freedom sometimes

553
00:24:33,378 --> 00:24:37,788
you just have to take it you can't and

554
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:39,199
that's what we're doing it's an awesome

555
00:24:37,788 --> 00:24:41,089
feeling when it's brought to my

556
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,278
attention I mean I do this every day

557
00:24:41,089 --> 00:24:45,048
this is my life and I don't really

558
00:24:43,278 --> 00:24:47,960
notice anything out of the ordinary but

559
00:24:45,048 --> 00:24:50,989
when we have people come in and say oh

560
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:53,480
that's amazing that you can do this and

561
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:56,538
it's so free and and Wow Vancouver's

562
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:58,759
such enormous in place you know it's

563
00:24:56,538 --> 00:25:00,589
really it's exciting you know it really

564
00:24:58,759 --> 00:25:05,798
is that we're showing people something

565
00:25:00,589 --> 00:25:08,839
that you know it's real freedom nobody's

566
00:25:05,798 --> 00:25:11,450
you know doing something that you know

567
00:25:08,839 --> 00:25:13,339
they deem important and there's it's not

568
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:15,319
a big deal you know and it's not it's

569
00:25:13,339 --> 00:25:16,579
only flour so and that's what we're

570
00:25:15,319 --> 00:25:19,009
trying to show people that's what we're

571
00:25:16,579 --> 00:25:21,710
trying to present so the flour that

572
00:25:19,009 --> 00:25:23,329
hasn't caused one death in recorded

573
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:26,538
history it's probably the oldest

574
