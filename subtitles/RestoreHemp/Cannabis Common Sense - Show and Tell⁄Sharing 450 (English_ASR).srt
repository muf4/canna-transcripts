Tell we have uh several of our Museum

3
00:00:05,799 --> 00:00:13,199
items from the hemp and cannabis uh

4
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:15,280
foundations uh collection of about 200

5
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:17,320
different medicinal canvas items and we

6
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:18,919
always bring out some things like this

7
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:21,240
this is hemp food that you can pick up

8
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:23,760
on the Internet or at health food stores

9
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:26,358
these are HED hemp seeds and HED hemp

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:30,000
seeds taste a lot like a cross between

11
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:33,000
cashews and walnuts and so if you like

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,719
nuts then I recommend HED hemp seeds

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,759
they taste really good you can get them

14
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,520
at health food stores right next door we

15
00:00:36,759 --> 00:00:41,759
find a cannabis tinure this is an

16
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:44,960
alcohol extract from the 1890s from the

17
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:47,238
company sharpen Dome sharpen Dome was in

18
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,799
business up to the 7s I believe then

19
00:00:47,238 --> 00:00:51,519
right next door to that we have two

20
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:54,439
different bottles one from the 1890s

21
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,399
another one from 1910 that uh are from

22
00:00:54,439 --> 00:00:58,558
Eli Lily and both of these were

23
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,198
different types of tinctures they have

24
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:03,518
different numbers on them let's see this

25
00:01:00,198 --> 00:01:07,000

26
00:01:03,518 --> 00:01:08,640
number 17 whatever that means anyway

27
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,840
next door we find from Mulford and

28
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,960
Company another cannabis tinure which is

29
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,799
a really Nifty thing so we have a whole

30
00:01:13,959 --> 00:01:18,280
set of bottles with cannabis tincture

31
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,479
then this is one of my favorites it's

32
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:22,759
from specific medicines and this was a

33
00:01:20,478 --> 00:01:24,599
bottle of American hemp they didn't even

34
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:26,680
call it cannabis in this case it means

35
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:28,478
the same thing folks hemp and cannabis

36
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:30,200
this is American hemp and what you'd

37
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:32,799
find in here are a bunch of marijuana of

38
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:36,240
flowers just like your you go to the and

39
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:38,880
and buy uh uh some flowers in the black

40
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:42,359
market back in the day which is like

41
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:44,718
1890 to 1920 you could buy these over

42
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:46,920
the counter at your Pharmacy American

43
00:01:44,718 --> 00:01:48,559
hemp and it has the the the wording on

44
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,960
the side of these bottles is really

45
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:54,519
amazing we'll have to to go over that

46
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:56,639
again someday now this is a cannabis oil

47
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:59,519
extract it's a recent product these are

48
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,799
cannabis uh hemp seed oil and hempseed

49
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:04,399
oil is very nutritious it has all the

50
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:07,960
good fats that Wipe Out the bad fats and

51
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:11,159
once you press hip seeds you get a third

52
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:13,239
30% oil and what's left over is this

53
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:15,719
stuff hemp flour which is very high in

54
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:18,239
protein and very healthy now the thing

55
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:21,199
about hemp seed oil is it is the most

56
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:24,039
productive seed oil crop and not only is

57
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:27,039
it healthy for you but it will run any

58
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:30,039
diesel engine and so if we could run our

59
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:32,239
diesel engines on hemp seed oil then we

60
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:33,719
would have such a supply of this hemp

61
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,640
flour that it would wipe out world

62
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:37,639
hunger and I think we're going to do

63
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:40,679
that in the next 20 or 30 years once we

64
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:44,399
end adult cannabis prohibition finally

65
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:46,000
from the 1870s or 1880s we have a

66
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,719
cannabis tincture bottle that you would

67
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,919
have found in an old epoc are or

68
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:51,919
drugstore way back when
