1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:04,740
we can stop the madness of marijuana

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:07,798
prohibition

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:09,780
there are people out there that are in

4
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:12,000
jail today like Mark Emery we saw his

5
00:00:09,779 --> 00:00:14,699
wife here a little bit ago he was in it

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,278
yesterday to five years simply for

7
00:00:14,699 --> 00:00:20,519
selling a seed

8
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:22,859
and if you go to Malaysia

9
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:25,439
there are people in Malaysia that are

10
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:28,560
sentenced to death just this week they

11
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:31,198
sent us the guy to death for just about

12
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:34,439
three pounds of marijuana and there are

13
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:37,679
people on ready scheduled to hang in

14
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:39,839
Malaysia for 300 grams

15
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:42,238
I think I'm carrying around about that

16
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:45,000
much right now you know so

17
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:47,039
anyway

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,780
we've got to stop this stuff you know

19
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,579
people are being incarcerated it's

20
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:52,079
ruining their lives we're losing our

21
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:55,198
children

22
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:57,299
even medical marijuana patients have to

23
00:00:55,198 --> 00:00:59,399
go through hell you know in Washington

24
00:00:57,299 --> 00:01:01,799
state the medical marijuana law just

25
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:04,439
right over there across that river is

26
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:06,539
just an affirmative defense

27
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:08,579
and you know that the medical marijuana

28
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:11,820
law is great it's helped a lot of people

29
00:01:08,579 --> 00:01:14,219
and sick people have an option now but

30
00:01:11,819 --> 00:01:16,139
it's not the solution

31
00:01:14,219 --> 00:01:19,019
it's a step

32
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:22,680
and what we really want to do is just

33
00:01:19,019 --> 00:01:25,079
completely legalize marijuana and hemp

34
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:27,780
and that's what we're working for

35
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:32,060
you know in California there is a

36
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:34,618
historic vote proposition 19. back in

37
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:36,900
1974 there was a vote in California that

38
00:01:34,618 --> 00:01:38,938
was also called proposition 19 and

39
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:42,118
coincidentally it was also a marijuana

40
00:01:38,938 --> 00:01:44,399
vote it was the first marijuana vote and

41
00:01:42,118 --> 00:01:47,118
he got about 40 percent of the vote back

42
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:50,280
then but this year's proposition 19

43
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:53,819
looks like it's going to win

44
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:56,340
if we can get our voters out we will win

45
00:01:53,819 --> 00:01:58,919
there we also have an initiative here in

46
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:02,640
Oregon that will help medical marijuana

47
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:04,618
patients that's ballot measure 74.

48
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,200
one of the chief petitioners was just up

49
00:02:04,618 --> 00:02:10,679
here Anthony Johnson so we strongly

50
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,479
support ballot measure 74. we urge you

51
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:15,420
to get out there and help us get it

52
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:17,639
passed and mobilized and register and

53
00:02:15,419 --> 00:02:20,878
vote because that's really one of the

54
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:23,579
keys here as we know in this system is

55
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:27,359
to register and vote and get our voters

56
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:30,420
out you know the polls show that ballot

57
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:33,000
measures 74 here in Oregon can pass by a

58
00:02:30,419 --> 00:02:35,878
good majority but if you go to the the

59
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,039
list of the people who are likely voters

60
00:02:35,878 --> 00:02:40,919
people who say yeah I'm definitely going

61
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:44,039
to vote it's a lot lot closer we're only

62
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:45,839
ahead by a couple of appoints where the

63
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:48,598
the polls show we're ahead by about 10

64
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:51,598
points overall but among likely voters

65
00:02:48,598 --> 00:02:54,119
it's much much closer that means our

66
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:57,179
unlikely voters need to get off their

67
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,800
Duff and get out there and vote and get

68
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:00,659
their friends to vote

69
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,879
because that's the only way we're going

70
00:03:00,659 --> 00:03:06,180
to make a difference here

71
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:09,000
you know we need to work for Global

72
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:11,580
cannabis freedom and that's what this

73
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,318
event is about we want to end adult

74
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:15,420
marijuana prohibition and restore

75
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:18,658
Industrial Hemp for all the many things

76
00:03:15,419 --> 00:03:20,579
that Industrial Hemp does key among

77
00:03:18,658 --> 00:03:22,859
those is energy

78
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:25,260
we think that when marijuana is legal

79
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:28,379
we'll be driving most of our cards on

80
00:03:25,259 --> 00:03:30,359
hemp seed oil most of the time on the

81
00:03:28,378 --> 00:03:33,539
world's most productive biodiesel

82
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:36,900
resource and the byproduct from that

83
00:03:33,539 --> 00:03:39,959
is food an acre of hip according to a

84
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:41,760
study out of uh University of Southern

85
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:45,598
Illinois that was published in Notre

86
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:47,818
Dame back in 74 an acre of hip wild hip

87
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:52,079
feral hip here in the United States will

88
00:03:47,818 --> 00:03:54,780
produce 8 500 pounds of seeds per acre

89
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:58,860
when you press that you get over 300

90
00:03:54,780 --> 00:04:02,280
gallons of oil per acre that's six

91
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:04,620
barrels of oil per acre just from a cold

92
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:08,459
pressing of the seed and the residue out

93
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:11,759
of that 8 500 pounds of seeds is 6 000

94
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:16,139
pounds of high protein hip seed meal

95
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:19,319
so if we start driving our cars on hemp

96
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:21,060
fuel the the waste product will Wipe Out

97
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:25,319
World Hunger

98
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:28,680
it's really a miracle plant I believe

99
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:31,800
that Hep and cannabis are the greatest

100
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,939
gift from our mother earth from the

101
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:36,540
Creator

102
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:39,180
and it's our job to bring that back

103
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:42,479
and it's going to take us all educating

104
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:45,060
our fellow Americans and getting out

105
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:47,519

who are sentenced to death and they're

122

going to hang and their families are

123

left there to deal with that to help the

124
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:32,160
people like Mark Emery and Eddie Lepp
