8
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:26,969

trouble in his life it's a non-violent

14
00:00:41,009 --> 00:00:46,140
crime none of these things there's

15
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:48,989
nothing about Rob to the public other

16
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:53,399
than the fact that my friend ride to

17
00:00:48,988 --> 00:00:56,669
Christy had the courage to post the sign

18
00:00:53,399 --> 00:01:01,489
on the front of his building in Hilo

19
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:07,219
Hawaii the sign said we smoked pot

20
00:01:01,488 --> 00:01:11,099
religiously and so can you gotta sign

21
00:01:07,219 --> 00:01:13,349
was on the front of the building right

22
00:01:11,099 --> 00:01:16,438
next to the sign for the Chamber of

23
00:01:13,349 --> 00:01:19,859
Commerce of Hilo Hawaii and he was there

24
00:01:16,438 --> 00:01:23,129
for almost ten years with his Hawaiian

25
00:01:19,859 --> 00:01:26,609
cannabis ministry and he was open about

26
00:01:23,129 --> 00:01:29,280
it he was really loud he ran for mayor

27
00:01:26,609 --> 00:01:32,219
he ran for governor he went every public

28
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:35,219
during and his message consistently was

29
00:01:32,219 --> 00:01:38,129
we got a real problem in Hawaii and it

30
00:01:35,219 --> 00:01:40,890
isn't hot it's left and look at this

31
00:01:38,129 --> 00:01:43,319
study i found it says if we just let

32
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:48,329
people have pot they won't use man and

33
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:52,019
he he he was a minister he picked up

34
00:01:48,328 --> 00:01:54,798
these religious mantle and he carried it

35
00:01:52,019 --> 00:02:01,590
forward and he helped a lot of people in

36
00:01:54,799 --> 00:02:03,899
his religious ministry and he decided

37
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:06,500
that it was important for him to defend

38
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:10,348
his rights to use cannabis as a

39
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:13,240
sacrament so important than in the year

40
00:02:10,348 --> 00:02:16,310
two thousand three he

41
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:19,969
sued the federal government to establish

42
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:22,370
his rights to religious freedom and the

43
00:02:19,969 --> 00:02:24,080
federal government fought the lawsuit

44
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:26,719
not by saying you don't have the right

45
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,790
but by saying hey we're not going to

46
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:30,620
investigate you he's not under

47
00:02:28,789 --> 00:02:33,049
investigation there's no threat of

48
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:35,060
federal prosecution he doesn't have a

49
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:37,189
case he has no standing you have to

50
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:40,039
throw his case out of court and that's

51
00:02:37,189 --> 00:02:41,810
what the federal courts did and so that

52
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:43,939
same federal government that said they

53
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:46,849
weren't investigating mr. Christie and

54
00:02:43,939 --> 00:02:49,449
they work on a prosecutor then sit in

55
00:02:46,849 --> 00:02:51,620
the narcs big time they spent two years

56
00:02:49,449 --> 00:02:54,289
investigating the small and all

57
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:57,860
religious cult in Hilo Hawaii that was

58
00:02:54,289 --> 00:03:01,099
operating openly they did everything

59
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:03,769
possible two years of video surveillance

60
00:03:01,099 --> 00:03:06,549
two years of narcs coming in to church

61
00:03:03,769 --> 00:03:10,360
and invading the privacy of the

62
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:14,209
religious context here two years of

63
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:15,830
wiretaps 17,000 the phone calls most of

64
00:03:14,209 --> 00:03:17,479
them people thinking they're talking to

65
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:23,209
their minister with the government

66
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:25,488
listening and this is this is what

67
00:03:23,209 --> 00:03:28,729
happened to Roger one day they came in

68
00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:31,219
and their rest not just Roger but 12 of

69
00:03:28,729 --> 00:03:33,768
his friends including his fiancÃ©e share

70
00:03:31,219 --> 00:03:36,650
and some people who were growing for the

71
00:03:33,769 --> 00:03:41,569
church you know just people who attended

72
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:45,079
the church 13 we have the Hawaii 13 this

73
00:03:41,569 --> 00:03:47,329
was july eight two years ago now

74
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:50,420
everyone else got bond that Roger he's

75
00:03:47,329 --> 00:03:54,049
too much of a danger to the community to

76
00:03:50,419 --> 00:03:56,089
release on bond see any they put all

77
00:03:54,049 --> 00:03:57,829
these charges together they combine them

78
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:59,810
they're all responsible for each other's

79
00:03:57,829 --> 00:04:04,879
plants and they get it over a thousand

80
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:07,340
plants and Rogers potentially might get

81
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:09,530
ten years of jail and that changes the

82
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:12,709
bomb was now that we have the war on

83
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:14,959
drugs and that means that they can keep

84
00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:17,209
him without bond they've had any promise

85
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:19,189
to bond this gentle person has never

86
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:22,129
heard a soul whose fought for our

87
00:04:19,189 --> 00:04:24,680
country whose Minister two thousand

88
00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:27,050
he's too dangerous to put out on the

89
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:29,329
streets this is our modern-day drug war

90
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:32,300
where we are the fodder in this war and

91
00:04:29,329 --> 00:04:34,909
we are getting trouble in the war no

92
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:36,620

93
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:39,620

94
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:42,439

95
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:44,990
years plus life sentences with

96
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:46,879
billion-dollar forfeitures we've got

97
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:48,500
people losing their farms we got people

98
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:50,839

losing their health we've got to do

100
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:56,539
something here everybody isn't that

101
00:04:52,279 --> 00:05:00,229
right all right so this is hemp fest we

102
00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:02,780
come out to celebrate how well we are

103
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:05,210
doing here and we are doing well we came

104
00:05:02,779 --> 00:05:07,189
to hempfest 15 years ago you had to keep

105
00:05:05,209 --> 00:05:09,229
looking over your shoulder you have a

106
00:05:07,189 --> 00:05:11,120
look for all the policemen coming

107
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:13,310
through the boats out there with

108
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:16,009
binoculars looking for people smoking on

109
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:17,930
the rocks the van they kept out here to

110
00:05:16,009 --> 00:05:20,449
arrest people and arresting over 100

111
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:22,699
people are weekend for just smoking here

112
00:05:20,449 --> 00:05:25,009
in the park but we continued mfest

113
00:05:22,699 --> 00:05:26,569
because it was our civil disobedience

114
00:05:25,009 --> 00:05:31,579
that we were going to change the laws

115
00:05:26,569 --> 00:05:33,560
with right and in 10 years 15 years a

116
00:05:31,579 --> 00:05:36,259
we've been doing this is it the worst of

117
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:38,930
it we have made these policemen

118
00:05:36,259 --> 00:05:41,800
understand one by one that we're not

119
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:44,240
dangerous we're not crazy and work

120
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:47,810
assets to their community and they best

121
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:50,269
work with us and that's why we're able

122
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:52,160
to do this FS without anybody in here

123
00:05:50,269 --> 00:05:54,109
running around looking for what we're

124
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,660
doing because we've kept it safe and

125
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:58,160
we've kept it clean and I guess that's

126
00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:00,020
the final message keep it clean

127
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:03,080
