1
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:02,960
[Applause]

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:04,799
Well, this is a very special day and a

3
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:09,160
very special event at a very special

4
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:09,160
time if I might say so myself.

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:15,120
You know, every generation that comes

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,039
along, it becomes necessary for somebody

7
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:19,278
to step forward who can articulate a

8
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:22,560
message of freedom and hope and show us

9
00:00:19,278 --> 00:00:24,480
a pathway from tyranny into liberty. And

10
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:26,399
for this generation, that person was

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,518
Jack Harer.

12
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:31,238
He wrote the book The Emperor Wears No

13
00:00:28,518 --> 00:00:34,238
Clothes in the late

14
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:38,439
1980s. And it's a collection of news

15
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:40,640
stories and clippings and factoids and

16
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:44,000
editorial. And it pretty much blew the

17
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:46,320
lid off of uh the whole international

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,200
awareness about the hemp plant, the

19
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,960
cannabis plant, what it used to do for

20
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:55,120
us, how it's been used for 5,000

21
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:57,039
years in thousands of different ways.

22
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:59,759
and also why it became illegal in this

23
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:01,640
country and how it was done and how it's

24
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:05,478
been persecuted and

25
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:07,680
victimized for decades for almost 80

26
00:01:05,478 --> 00:01:09,959
years. Jack Hair came to the first

27
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,400
Seattle Hemp Fest in

28
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:13,919
1991 and it was a lot like this right

29
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,719
here. It looked really a lot like this

30
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:19,759
in Volunteer Park in Seattle.

31
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:21,039
And I just want to say that these guys,

32
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,599
Justin and everybody have done an

33
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,040
amazing job. Give a hand for all the

34
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:26,798
volunteers and all the folks that made

35
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,960
this possible to bring. We're

36
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:31,960
celebrating a different aroma in Tacoma

37
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:31,959
today.

38
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,200
We're celebrating the cannabis plant,

39
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:40,239
one of the most versatile plants in the

40
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:43,000
world. So,

41
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:45,679
keep going. So, in in honor of Jack

42
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,920
Herror, who you know you know Jack had a

43
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:54,079
stroke and a heart attack speaking at at

44
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,439
uh the World Hemp Expo in Oregon and uh

45
00:01:54,078 --> 00:01:56,639
most people would have been done from

46
00:01:55,438 --> 00:01:59,039
that point. They never would have gone

47
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,640
back on the road again. But Jack, even

48
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,920
though he was half paralyzed from a

49
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,359
stroke and he had to learn to speak

50
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,840
again, he wasn't that great of a speaker

51
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:07,438
all of a sudden. That didn't stop him.

52
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,959
And Jack went back on the road and never

53
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:11,199
missed another Hemp Fest after that

54
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:14,000
Seattle Hemp Fest. And when he had his

55
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:16,399
next stroke, he was speaking at Hemptock

56
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,360
down in Portland last year, right after

57
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,120
he spoke. No one's that dedicated. Jack

58
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,160
literally gave his life for the cannabis

59
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,599
movement. He refused to stop and every

60
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:27,280
year he got better and better. He got

61
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:28,959
his speaking skills back and pretty soon

62
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,439
you could really understand him. But it

63
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:32,959
never stopped Jack. And uh he always

64
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:34,560
would have to be in his booth meeting

65
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,519
people and signing copies. The emperor

66
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,519
wears no clothes. And uh so in honor of

67
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,159
Jack Hera, I want to if we can do this

68
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,680
with this many people, but I think we

69
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:46,479
can call enough respect and enough honor

70
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,879
for Jack to say thank you by a brief

71
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:50,238
moment of silence. So we're going to do

72
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:51,799
that. If we can hear this generator

73
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,080
behind us, we know we're doing a good

74
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:55,519
job. Let's just take a few moments out

75
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,280
for a brief moment to send out a prayer

76
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:00,280
to Jack because I think he's here with

77
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,280
us.

78
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:11,139
[Applause]

79
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:17,359
Thank you so much. And uh I'm going to

80
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,140
give back give a hand to this man who's

81
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,570
making it all possible.

82
00:03:19,139 --> 00:03:22,569
[Applause]
