1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,899
so we'll see what kind of energy we have

2
00:00:02,549 --> 00:00:05,899
here tonight collectively

3
00:00:50,448 --> 00:00:58,158
it is what it is

4
00:00:53,698 --> 00:01:02,549
so no use it was hoping we want to you

5
00:00:58,158 --> 00:01:06,530
and those if only and those kuda shooter

6
00:01:02,549 --> 00:01:10,890
Buddha's are these troubles for the head

7
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:14,000
been crying round by most it's just a

8
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:14,000
waste to tears

9
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:28,280
life

10
00:01:25,469 --> 00:01:31,129
doesn't put anything in front of us that

11
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:35,599
we can't handle

12
00:01:31,129 --> 00:01:42,449
it's all in the handling coherent

13
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:45,899
opponent Larry okay

14
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:49,859
and another thing everything that ever

15
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:53,430
happens is there to make us strong

16
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:55,219
and when we understand our strengths get

17
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:58,310
strong

18
00:01:55,219 --> 00:02:00,679
and when we don't understand our

19
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:05,469
weaknesses get strong

20
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:05,470
it's an adaptability

21
00:02:12,189 --> 00:02:22,150
he went flowing down falls down

22
00:02:16,729 --> 00:02:22,149
so down keep falling down fall down

23
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:27,870
getting back up gets back

24
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:15,160
for human recognition to recognize the

25
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:22,409
power of clear sake

26
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:22,409
is the way Puri he see

27
00:03:23,189 --> 00:03:32,629
it's not about whether we can or can't

28
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:32,629
it's about whether we will or we won't

29
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:44,789
the blamers in the plane play a

30
00:03:42,158 --> 00:03:44,789
dangerous game

31
00:03:46,598 --> 00:03:53,938
taking responsibility another one of

32
00:03:51,009 --> 00:03:53,938
their casualties

33
00:03:54,419 --> 00:04:03,009
inside ourselves amongst Tressa

34
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:09,759
yes parade

35
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:13,090
well the light cast by our shadows might

36
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:13,090
hold its breath

37
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:17,430
we for us

38
00:04:17,649 --> 00:04:26,099
to recognize the gift we have been given

39
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:30,480
it's a decision

40
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:48,089
it is what it is now he's wishing their

41
00:04:46,269 --> 00:04:51,370
folly

42
00:04:48,089 --> 00:04:55,168
with us

43
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:55,168
or just troubles for the head

44
00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:04,040
grind round about mostly is just a waste

45
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:04,040
of years
