1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,959
it's always nice to be at the him fast

2
00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:06,449
break like somebody asked me when I

3
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:08,069
first got in town why do you still have

4
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:11,759
the hemp fest I talk to you guys won

5
00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:13,679
well we won in the sense that legal

6
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,630
marijuana is now legal in Washington but

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,820
we're not near finish there are a lot of

8
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:19,920
problems that still exists for example

9
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:22,560
people still lose their jobs every day

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,210
in Washington not for showing up the

11
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:26,070
work in an impaired condition but

12
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:27,630
because they smoked on the weekend and

13
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:29,849
they got drug tested on the first of the

14
00:00:27,629 --> 00:00:32,909
week and the FTC in their system that's

15
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:34,619
obviously I'm bear we still have young

16
00:00:32,909 --> 00:00:37,259
parents who are having to fight for

17
00:00:34,619 --> 00:00:40,049
child custody to ring retain custody of

18
00:00:37,259 --> 00:00:42,299
their child when the only suggestion is

19
00:00:40,049 --> 00:00:44,669
that they're not fit parents is that

20
00:00:42,299 --> 00:00:46,979
they smoke marijuana now that's absurd

21
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:50,160
that's left over from reefer madness

22
00:00:46,979 --> 00:00:52,140
days so and we still have some problems

23
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:54,119
with DUI d we still need the right to

24
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:56,579
grow our own marijuana in Washington

25
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:58,738
where recreational users still can't so

26
00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:02,789
there's a lot of work to still be done

27
00:00:58,738 --> 00:01:05,849
before we marijuana smokers have treated

28
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:07,920
fairly but I will say this the people in

29
00:01:05,849 --> 00:01:09,868
Washington deserve enormous credit you

30
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,969
were the first you broke you broke the

31
00:01:09,868 --> 00:01:14,340
door prohibition wide open you in

32
00:01:11,969 --> 00:01:16,530
Colorado and there's no turning back so

33
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:18,540
we are in your death a gallop it at

34
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:20,489
first ask the question of how many

35
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:23,580
Americans support legalizing marijuana

36
00:01:20,489 --> 00:01:25,319
in 1969 it was the year before we

37
00:01:23,579 --> 00:01:27,269
started normal and only twelve percent

38
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:29,578
of the public supported legalization

39
00:01:27,269 --> 00:01:32,099
eighty eight percent were opposed to it

40
00:01:29,578 --> 00:01:34,618
now fast forward to about three years

41
00:01:32,099 --> 00:01:37,140
ago when for the first time the national

42
00:01:34,618 --> 00:01:39,000
polling began to show a slight majority

43
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:41,670
of the country favoring full

44
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,469
legalization now we've got five or six

45
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:45,629
polls that show anywhere from 51 to

46
00:01:43,469 --> 00:01:48,420
fifty eight percent of the entire public

47
00:01:45,629 --> 00:01:50,670
it's not that they're pro pod it is that

48
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:53,368
they understand prohibition hasn't

49
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:55,109
worked it's a failed public policy only

50
00:01:53,368 --> 00:01:57,090
about fourteen percent of the country

51
00:01:55,109 --> 00:01:59,578
are regular smokers eighty-six percent

52
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:00,079
or not but the majority of those non

53
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:02,269
smoke

54
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:04,909
now support our position a full

55
00:02:02,269 --> 00:02:06,819
legalization so as long as we retain

56
00:02:04,909 --> 00:02:10,159
their support there's no turning back

57
00:02:06,819 --> 00:02:12,289
we've known at least 10 or 15 years and

58
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:14,840
we were going to win this battle because

59
00:02:12,289 --> 00:02:17,629
of the demographics but all the surveys

60
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:19,340
showed or that older Americans people my

61
00:02:17,629 --> 00:02:21,469
age and older were the problem we grew

62
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:23,659
up in the middle of reefer madness and

63
00:02:21,469 --> 00:02:24,800
it's hard to change people's opinion if

64
00:02:23,659 --> 00:02:27,289
that's what their whole world they've

65
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,240
known but we also noticed that younger

66
00:02:27,289 --> 00:02:31,159
Americans whether they smoked or not it

67
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:34,159
didn't much matter marijuana is no big

68
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:36,379
deal to them so we knew eventually our

69
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:38,840
fallback strategy we used to laugh as if

70
00:02:36,379 --> 00:02:40,609
necessary will outlive the bastards well

71
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:44,270
in some degree I think that's what

72
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:45,680
happened generationally the younger

73
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:47,750
Americans were always going to

74
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,219
eventually legalize marijuana I just

75
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,800
wasn't sure that I would live long

76
00:02:49,219 --> 00:02:53,240
enough to see it and I say I am

77
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,610
exhilarated every morning when I get up

78
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:57,560
to that have the chance to witness this

79
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:58,970
really happening in America well we

80
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:01,699
thank you for putting the lawyers

81
00:02:58,969 --> 00:03:05,120
together into a group that could could

82
00:03:01,699 --> 00:03:07,639
learn about protecting the laws and just

83
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:11,230
helping people not not see the drug war

84
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:11,229
being so hard to their families
