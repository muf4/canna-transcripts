1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,318
Thank you for taking time for him.

2
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:06,719
Tonight on our show, we have a very

3
00:00:04,318 --> 00:00:08,800
unusual and a unique guest. Unusual in

4
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:10,599
the sense that he has spent a lifetime

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,359
defending the sanctuary of the

6
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:15,199
individual and trying to bring it bring

7
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:16,960
bring about the importance that

8
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:18,399
government stays out of the individual's

9
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,359
life and the individual's allowed to

10
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:24,079
make their own choices. Brent, he's a

11
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,279
futurist. He's able to foresee farther

12
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:27,358
down the road than many of his

13
00:00:25,278 --> 00:00:29,160
contemporaries and tries his best to

14
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,599
bring forth his knowledge and his

15
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,600
insights. Please welcome on our show Dr.

16
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:36,159
Timothy Larry. Well, Casper, it's a

17
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,000
pleasure to be here. I uh approve very

18
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:40,159
highly of your program. I understand

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,920
it's growing nationwide now. Yes, sir.

20
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:43,759
Yes, sir. How many uh cities are you in

21
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,960
now? At present, we're in 80 cities and

22
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:49,039
in 44 states. Oh, boy. That's good. And

23
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:52,000
uh getting the word out like this is

24
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,679
very exciting. Uh now you've always been

25
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,840
known as the highest rider of every

26
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:57,359
generational wave. The what? The highest

27
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,800
rider of every generational wave. You've

28
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:01,600
been the forefront. You've been there

29
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:04,798
from from the World War II to the early

30
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:07,599
60s, the '7s, able to, you know, speak

31
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,200
the voice and be heard and foresee it.

32
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:11,280
Realizing this, how do you think the

33
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,359
wave of the hemp movement is going to

34
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,478
settle into the population and break

35
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:17,680
upon the the uh shores of our ecology

36
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:19,920
problems?

37
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,840
Frank, the shores are ecology problem.

38
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,400
Yes, sir. I can see that. Oceans of

39
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,400
green hemp doing

40
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,080
that.

41
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:30,960
Um,

42
00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:32,599
the present laws against hemp, I think,

43
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:37,000
are the most

44
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:42,000
irrational and uh I would say almost

45
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,519
insane pieces of puritanic legislation.

46
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,359
Maybe you have to go back to the Salem

47
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:47,519
witchcraft trials to get something where

48
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:50,239
so much hysteria has picked out

49
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:52,959
something so benign and so harmless and

50
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:56,879
so profitable and so productive and had

51
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:59,478
this all out moral fierce religious

52
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:02,718
campaign against uh

53
00:01:59,478 --> 00:02:07,280
hemp. Why do you think that uh there is

54
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:10,159
this uh religious fundamentalist and

55
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,840
police government uh prejudice against

56
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:13,919
him? Well, how do you explain it? My

57
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,120
personal views that I feel that it stems

58
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:18,719
from a lot of the uh well companies and

59
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,200
the people who can make money off it

60
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:23,120
being illegal, keeping it illegal and

61
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:26,318
together put together a propaganda

62
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:29,280
campaign to mislead the public

63
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:30,878
and I feel that it will set into u the

64
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,199
people's mind eventually when the truth

65
00:02:30,878 --> 00:02:36,719
is more exposed. Now you I understand

66
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:39,919
that we're not going to talk about the

67
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:41,598
religious or the emotional psychological

68
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:43,199
aspects of hemp. Correct. The

69
00:02:41,598 --> 00:02:44,719
recreational. Yeah, we won't talk about

70
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:47,399
that at all. We're going to talk about

71
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:50,878
the uh

72
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:52,800
practical uh and the profitable and

73
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:55,439
productive. Yes, sir. And the ecological

74
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,439
aspects of it. Absolutely. Uh I don't

75
00:02:55,439 --> 00:03:00,479
know a lot about that. I've read books

76
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:02,719
by Jack Herrer. I've listened. Gosh,

77
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:04,318
there's so many programs and so many

78
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:06,919
articles these days. Everywhere you turn

79
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:09,759
around, you hear intelligent discussions

80
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:13,199
about hemp as a substitute for oil. Hemp

81
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:17,039
as a substitute for wood pulp. Hemp as a

82
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:19,439
source of energy. It's exciting. The the

83
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:22,799
thing that I know most about however is

84
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:25,519
the uh puritanical crusade against hemp

85
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,760
because you know I I I was in prison for

86
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,759
four and a half years for under an ounce

87
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:31,878
right for the possession of two roaches

88
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:36,318
which had been planted in my car by a

89
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:39,359
generous overly generous policeman. Um

90
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:41,280
and uh at one point I found myself in

91
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,519
prison facing like 50 years

92
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,640
imprisonment. I was 50 years at the

93
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:49,280
time, 50 years old going, "Well, this is

94
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:52,559
a strange series of events for such a

95
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:56,400
harmless u and even beneficial situation

96
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:58,080
to be charged with so much time." Um,

97
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,840
now you escaped from there, too, didn't

98
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,599
you? The first Well, I did what any

99
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,280
sensible 50-year-old would do if you're

100
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:05,039
facing 50 years in prison for two

101
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,840
roaches of marijuana they planted in

102
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:09,598
your car. Uh, the only common sense

103
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,239
thing to do is to escape. and I did that

104
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:14,359
and uh made a few little be movie

105
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:18,160
adventures there.

106
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:20,560
U there are there are many things in our

107
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:23,840
society that have to be controlled and

108
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:27,918
governed. Uh for example, oil look at

109
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:30,560
the way oil is polluting and um um our

110
00:04:27,918 --> 00:04:33,519
atmosphere and acid rain and so forth.

111
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,879
Uh guns should be controlled. I think

112
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:35,839
drugs like steroids should be

113
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:37,439
controlled. I think there should be

114
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:40,119
probably more control over alcohol and

115
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:44,279
nicotine and the but of all

116
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:48,040
the of all of the uh botanical

117
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:51,279
vegetable species that the government is

118
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:53,360
attacking, marijuana is the one they're

119
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:58,239
going after. That's interesting. You

120
00:04:53,360 --> 00:05:01,520
know, I sometimes say that um hemp is is

121
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:04,879
a is a is a democratic plant because it

122
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:08,399
was during the Democratic uh regime of

123
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:11,680
Jimmy Carter that uh hemp was legalized

124
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:13,918
in 14 states and uh Carter himself and

125
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:17,360
his cabinet wanted to decriminalize

126
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:19,359
marijuana. And in 1980, you had uh the

127
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:22,000
Republicans coming in with a hard line,

128
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:25,280
typical crush them, down him, just say

129
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,120
no. Yeah. And suddenly the new drugs

130
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:29,038
which are everywhere are drugs that I

131
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:32,000
never heard of back in the 60s and the

132
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:35,759
late 70s. Things like crack and cocaine

133
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,639
and steroids. Uh they they didn't exist.

134
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:41,280
So I call them the Republican drugs. Now

135
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:43,199
they're Republican drugs. Why? Because

136
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:44,959
Republicans are hardliners like to feel

137
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,079
tough and aggressive. And I'm number

138
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:48,159
one. And we're going to go over there

139
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:50,079
and we're going to know kick butt. Mhm.

140
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,080
And if you're going to go out there and

141
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:53,279
you loot a lot of savings and loans

142
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:55,359
companies and if you're going to go out

143
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:56,399
there, you know, you got to have a lot

144
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,879
of energy and you got a lot of

145
00:05:56,399 --> 00:06:01,120
self-confidence. You got to take to up

146
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:02,800
with cocaine or a little steroids there.

147
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:06,240
Arnold Schwarzenegger, of course, is the

148
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:08,840
typical example of the of the steroid.

149
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:12,639
we call him Conan the Republican, you

150
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:19,318
know, whereas uh the one thing about the

151
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:22,079
the use of of hemp as a uh as a as a

152
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:23,919
drug, I've had to warn Republicans about

153
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:25,680
this. If you're a Republican and you're

154
00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:27,519
a hardliner and you want to go out there

155
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,360
and kick and scratch and get yourself to

156
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:30,639
the top and if you're in the army or the

157
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:34,319
police or anything, you ought to have to

158
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:36,960
be tough and mean and stay away from him

159
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,800
cuz he will turn you into a wimp. I

160
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:41,198
mean, really, look at Carter. He was

161
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,478
believing in peace and love and we stop

162
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,600
all the wrong things, right? All the

163
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:46,959
terrible things. All the terrible

164
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:48,319
things. You understand why? Right now,

165
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:50,959
the government is spending much more

166
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:54,800
money crushing the the production of

167
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:57,839
hemp. And another thing that puzzles me

168
00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:00,478
about the insanity or the even the

169
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:04,918
diabolical nature of the right-wing

170
00:07:00,478 --> 00:07:08,240
religious Republican situation.

171
00:07:04,918 --> 00:07:10,959
U why do they go after the American

172
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:13,038
farmers? They spend more money fighting

173
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:15,598
hemp in this country. You know, in in in

174
00:07:13,038 --> 00:07:18,079
California, which is my home state, uh,

175
00:07:15,598 --> 00:07:20,478
hemp was the number one agricultural

176
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:22,478
cash product. In Iowa, in Tennessee,

177
00:07:20,478 --> 00:07:24,719
like back in Indiana, where I'm from,

178
00:07:22,478 --> 00:07:26,800
how many states? Uh, at least that we're

179
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,160
aware of 28 or more. Yeah. Honest

180
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,079
farmers out there trying to make a

181
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,439
living of growing hemp. And the

182
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:34,879
government is out there arresting these

183
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:37,519
goodhearted free enterprise farming

184
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:39,800
agricultural Americans. Meanwhile, down

185
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:43,120
in Colombia and Peru,

186
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:44,879
these gangsters, these cocaine cartel

187
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,639
people are making billions of dollars

188
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:49,360
and we're spending less money on them.

189
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:51,120
It's a how come I think you're probably

190
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:54,800
right that

191
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:56,560
uh they uh they don't want people to be

192
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,120
using hemp because it would interfere

193
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:02,439
with the oil monopoly. It would

194
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:04,840
interfere with the wood pulp monopoly.

195
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:07,038
Uh, and also I

196
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:10,318
think there's something really

197
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:12,079
religiously diabolic and evil about the

198
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,879
right-wing Christians in this country

199
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:17,120
who go after him because they hate

200
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,960
people to have pro-choice and to make

201
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,478
your own decisions about your life and

202
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:22,959
uh they seem to be some of the people

203
00:08:20,478 --> 00:08:24,399
too who overlook the medical aspects of

204
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:25,839
Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. Now, from your

205
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:27,598
perspective and being in being a

206
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:30,959
psychiatrist as you are, you've had the

207
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:33,200
opportunity to become acquainted with

208
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:34,718
many different aspects of healing and

209
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,719
some of the some of the more positive

210
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:39,360
benefits of the uses of hemp. Could you

211
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:41,599
share that please?

212
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:45,600
Well, there have been enormous number of

213
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:48,240
studies that show that hemp and cannabis

214
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,839
is of course extremely necessary for

215
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,720
certain forms of glaucoma. You simply

216
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:56,240
have to have it. Mhm. There in many

217
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:58,639
states these these fanatic anti-pleasure

218
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:01,039
people are so afraid that the patient

219
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:03,519
who's going blind might enjoy the

220
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:05,360
experience that you got to go blind you

221
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:07,039
to die but don't have a good time

222
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,720
because the Republicans are in power. I

223
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:10,480
mean that's apparently the logic here.

224
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,879
Aren't they using it too for anorexia

225
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,480
and for cancer aids? Exly. me. There's

226
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:15,919
one terrible thing about hemp and I

227
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,240
don't want to get into the u you know

228
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:20,399
the use of marijuana but I got to be

229
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,639
honest with you there are some terrible

230
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:25,080
side effects of smoking or using

231
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:28,159
marijuana. One is

232
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:29,920
um it's called refrigerator blackout. I

233
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:31,519
mean you get the munchies. Oh okay. You

234
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:32,719
know you suddenly you smoke a joint and

235
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,120
suddenly you there you are the next

236
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,800
thing you know you've eaten nine pounds

237
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,879
of fig noon and say that that now that's

238
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:41,359
that's dangerous. You got you got to be

239
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:44,480
careful there. Uh on the other hand, if

240
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,159
you're dying of cancer or malnourished

241
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,240
because of stomach problems and you

242
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:51,600
don't have any appetite, hemp of course

243
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:54,240
is the logical and obvious and natural

244
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,720
medicine to give you an appetite to see

245
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,959
you through that period. But again, a

246
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,720
good true Puritan would rather have you

247
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:02,639
die.

248
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,399
Now, we have a good meal while you're

249
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:07,278
giggling.

250
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:09,759
We also know that it's good for stress

251
00:10:07,278 --> 00:10:13,039
to calm you down. And from a viewpoint

252
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:14,319
of a psychiatrist, is there any benefits

253
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:16,159
for someone who might be having

254
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,640
emotional or mental problems as opposed

255
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:20,240
to giving them like

256
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:21,759
um volumes or some of these other

257
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,560
stronger drugs that seem to be causing

258
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:25,759
problem like Prozac and so on? Yeah.

259
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:30,359
Well, number one, I don't want to come

260
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:32,639
out like a smart smartass here and every

261
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:34,959
psychological situation is individual

262
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:36,958
and needs its own u you know its own

263
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:40,719
pharma pharmacology. So I don't want to

264
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:43,679
generalize um but certainly uh the

265
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,680
things about hemp is it's not addictive.

266
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:48,759
It's extremely uh harm doesn't have any

267
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:50,759
of the side effects of uh many of the

268
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:53,200
euphorics and the

269
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:55,120
anti-depressants that are approved and

270
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:58,640
that doctor's prescriptions will give

271
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:01,039
you. So uh yeah there's a

272
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:04,199
uh you see the thing about religious

273
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:07,599
fanaticism is that the crazier the

274
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:09,360
nuttier the wilder and almost the more

275
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,159
nonsensical the belief the more you hang

276
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,919
on to it. So that um I've debated for

277
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:16,559
many years a man who was the head of the

278
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:19,039
DEA for about five years name is Peter

279
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:21,518
Beniger. Yeah, you have. And I can't

280
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:25,559
believe him. He's going after hemp. And

281
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:28,560
he's trying to say that oh hemp

282
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:32,000
one they gave a lot of some some mice

283
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:34,319
some hemp and it made male mice, teenage

284
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,240
male mice and it made their breasts grow

285
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:40,000
a little. So he say college boys you see

286
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:42,079
going why is he going? the real problems

287
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,399
of cracked babies in the in the inner

288
00:11:42,078 --> 00:11:47,838
city and alcohol which was our number

289
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:49,360
one drug here and uh nicotine half a

290
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:52,320
million people die a year from that.

291
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:54,919
Here's this guy blathering on about the

292
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:57,600
the dangers of of uh

293
00:11:54,919 --> 00:12:00,639
of I don't know he never did mention

294
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,480
whether uh whether marijuana would make

295
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,600
girls breasts bigger but I don't even

296
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,440
want to get into that. The whole thing

297
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,120
is now you've also had a few debates

298
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,920
with Gordon Litty too. Yeah, that's

299
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:13,200
right. Yeah. and uh he seems to think

300
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:15,919
that uh marijuana i.e. camp is one of

301
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:18,720
the um the plants that's going to lead

302
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:21,360
to a complete social breakdown and our

303
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:23,440
structure of government and you see well

304
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,959
I know Gordon Lady uh I've been debating

305
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:29,600
him I've known him for years over 25

306
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:32,479
years I know exactly how his mind works

307
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:35,680
and like a good army man like a good

308
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:38,079
military man like a good policeman like

309
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:41,199
a good follower of his leader uh Richard

310
00:12:38,078 --> 00:12:44,239
Nixon okay Gordon Litty has never had

311
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:47,200
one unauthorized thought in his life. So

312
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:49,600
he he reads the the line so he knows.

313
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:52,800
But what LSD makes you jump out of

314
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:54,000
windows. Uh marijuana makes you uh what

315
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:55,359
is that? Not I forget what it is. I say

316
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,720
it's the gateway drug. Yeah. What's the

317
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:01,600
gateway drug? Yeah. It's the gateway

318
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:01,600
drug. Yeah. So uh

319
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:06,959
um I see I must say here and I don't

320
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:09,278
want to offend anyone and if you're a if

321
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:12,078
you're a deeply uh devout Christian I

322
00:13:09,278 --> 00:13:14,078
want you to turn your TV off now. But uh

323
00:13:12,078 --> 00:13:16,479
I feel that there's a great problem in

324
00:13:14,078 --> 00:13:18,000
this country in a violation of our civil

325
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,079
liberties and personal rights on the

326
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,480
basis of the federal government

327
00:13:20,078 --> 00:13:26,078
interfering with women's bodies about

328
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:28,480
abortion and uh the uh these insane war

329
00:13:26,078 --> 00:13:30,399
on drugs. It's a war on drugs. It's a

330
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,240
war on Americans. It's not a war on

331
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:35,759
Russians or evil communists and all

332
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:37,680
that. You made us a war against 40 or 50

333
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:39,838
million of us marijuana smokers in this

334
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:44,239
country, which in a way seems like a

335
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:46,079
weird thing that uh majority in Congress

336
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,399
should suddenly declare war on 30

337
00:13:46,078 --> 00:13:51,759
million otherwise taxpaying uh

338
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:54,519
reasonably productive American citizens.

339
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:57,679
Um the

340
00:13:54,519 --> 00:14:01,198
uh I think that uh the basis is

341
00:13:57,679 --> 00:14:02,198
religion. Okay. And basis is that you're

342
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:05,519
not

343
00:14:02,198 --> 00:14:08,078
allowed to choose what you want to do.

344
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:10,639
It's like any fanatic religious they'll

345
00:14:08,078 --> 00:14:13,039
tell you you can't use contraceptives

346
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:14,519
because you can't enjoy sex. And if you

347
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:17,360
do

348
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:19,278
have conceive a baby, you have no choice

349
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,199
about whether you want to uh bring this

350
00:14:19,278 --> 00:14:24,559
baby when you can handle this baby. And

351
00:14:21,198 --> 00:14:26,719
the same thing is true about u about u

352
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:29,599
the choice of uh of your own

353
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:33,720
self-medication. And uh I I personally

354
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:36,480
believe that u the war on drugs is the

355
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:38,959
worst attack on American freedom that

356
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:42,079
we've experienced in in 200 years. You

357
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:44,399
know this is the 200th anniversary of

358
00:14:42,078 --> 00:14:47,039
the Bill of Rights. It was in 1791 that

359
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:49,440
they passed those 10 wonderful bills and

360
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:51,599
the basically what most people don't

361
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,440
realize is that the Bill of Rights in

362
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,240
the Constitution is designed to protect

363
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,760
the individual against the government.

364
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,360
Mhm. So, the government can't come into

365
00:14:57,759 --> 00:15:01,600
your house without a search warrant. The

366
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,440
government can't put u soldiers in your

367
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,680
house. The government can't force you to

368
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,880
uh to testify against yourself. The

369
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:08,559
government can't tell you what to read

370
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:10,559
or write. The government can't tell you

371
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:11,919
how to worship your own god. The

372
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:15,278
government can't tell you how to really

373
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:18,000
mind your own business. So, um uh it's

374
00:15:15,278 --> 00:15:21,039
both ironic and I think it's also very

375
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,639
hopeful that in the year uh 1991 in the

376
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:24,799
200th anniversary of the Bill of Rights,

377
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,799
uh this hemp movement is is growing. And

378
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:29,198
I want to tell you it is growing. I give

379
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:31,519
a lot of talks to uh to students and

380
00:15:29,198 --> 00:15:34,078
colleges and the awareness of the

381
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:35,759
insanity of the marijuana laws is

382
00:15:34,078 --> 00:15:37,519
becoming uh I think more and more

383
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:39,439
obvious. That tells us that perhaps we

384
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:41,240
are finally making an impact across the

385
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,440
United States and perhaps around the

386
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:45,360
world. We are really enjoying this

387
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:48,160
interview and we'll be right back after

388
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:50,079
this. Thank you. Welcome back to Time

389
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:52,639
for Him. Today on our show we have the

390
00:15:50,078 --> 00:15:54,399
distinguished Dr. Timothy Liry. Timothy,

391
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,639
I think you've been aware of some of the

392
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:59,919
changes in the laws here within the

393
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:01,839
American uh structure of Congress and

394
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:04,559
all the way down to dog catcher opinions

395
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:07,880
from Nancy Reagan swaying our opinions

396
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:10,399
to just say no. Uh I have a

397
00:16:07,879 --> 00:16:13,519
mot and a bumper sticker and a t-shirt.

398
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:15,120
It says just say K. No, think for

399
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:17,839
yourself and don't believe what Nancy

400
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,759
Reagan says. Don't believe what I say.

401
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:22,800
think for yourself and question

402
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:24,560
authority and uh you'll uh well because

403
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:26,719
of this conservatism though some of the

404
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:29,599
laws that were established during the

405
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:32,320
Carter administration such as um

406
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:35,519
decriminalization of of marijuana etc

407
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:38,480
are beginning to go back to another era

408
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:40,159
back when minds were narrow and Alaska

409
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,079
they've changed the laws back to stiffen

410
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:44,799
the laws we are going through a period

411
00:16:42,078 --> 00:16:47,958
now it's a uh what happened in the 60s

412
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:50,719
and 70s we had in this country a Classic

413
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:53,599
Renaissance. Now read the history books.

414
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:56,959
A renaissance is a period when there's a

415
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:58,879
sudden surge in self-exression in the

416
00:16:56,958 --> 00:17:01,359
rights of the individual, a loosening of

417
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:04,240
the control of authority, a questioning

418
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:06,240
of religious dogma, and then a lurch

419
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:09,038
forward. This is always followed by a

420
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:12,240
hardlined retreat. So that it's at the

421
00:17:09,038 --> 00:17:14,798
same time that u there has uh in the

422
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:18,078
last 10 years in America under Reagan

423
00:17:14,798 --> 00:17:20,240
and Bush and this very repressive hard

424
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:23,879
line, look what's happened to the rest

425
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:27,439
of the world. Um, you

426
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:31,360
know, in in Russia just uh 3 weeks ago

427
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:33,759
when they had that uh coup and then uh a

428
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:36,879
bunch of young people in in Moscow

429
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:38,160
protected Yelen and and stop the tanks.

430
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:41,480
You know who it was that was stopping

431
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:44,798
the tanks? It was young Russians

432
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:46,240
students who were throwing flowers at

433
00:17:44,798 --> 00:17:47,519
the tanks. That sounds familiar, doesn't

434
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,279
it? Does that sound familiar? They

435
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:52,558
learned that absolutely from the

436
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:54,879
American um uh in the 60s and 70s when

437
00:17:52,558 --> 00:17:56,960
we were questioning the authority of of

438
00:17:54,880 --> 00:18:00,799
Johnson and and Nixon and stopping the

439
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:02,798
Vietnam War. Uh uh another thing that

440
00:18:00,798 --> 00:18:04,918
was amusing about the the Russian

441
00:18:02,798 --> 00:18:08,639
Revolution and it's very connected with

442
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:12,160
this the three men who young men who got

443
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:15,280
shot by the tanks and were immediately

444
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:17,519
promoted to the highest office or honor

445
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:20,960
of the Soviet Union. the highest order

446
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:23,359
of of the of the of the land. They were

447
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,679
three hippies. They had one was a

448
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:28,240
grateful dead

449
00:18:24,679 --> 00:18:30,400
head and one like heavy metal rock and

450
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:32,839
uh they let their hair grow and they all

451
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:35,280
had learned to smoke a hashish in

452
00:18:32,839 --> 00:18:37,439
Afghanistan. And indeed they were trying

453
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:39,119
to stop the tanks because it was their

454
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,120
brothers and their friends and their

455
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:43,839
colleagues who were in the tanks because

456
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:45,439
the uh there turned out that the the

457
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:47,279
Soviet soldiers that have been sent to

458
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:50,960
Afghanistan hated the idea of going down

459
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:53,038
there and uh killing Afghani people for

460
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:55,120
no apparent reason. So that I'm very

461
00:18:53,038 --> 00:18:58,400
proud of the fact that although in

462
00:18:55,119 --> 00:19:01,279
America we've had this uh this very

463
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:04,798
predictable but very violent and mean

464
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:07,359
and nasty Puritanism and you can't smoke

465
00:19:04,798 --> 00:19:09,279
cigarettes and there's they're censoring

466
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:12,319
uh rock and roll records and they're

467
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:13,519
censoring books. Now one by one they're

468
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:15,839
going down the list of personal

469
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:18,639
freedoms. At the same time, the basic

470
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:21,038
American freedoms which we uh set going

471
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:23,200
in the 60s are appearing in the Soviet

472
00:19:21,038 --> 00:19:25,119
Union. I go with you and ours are

473
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,200
reversing it seems like. Yeah. It seems

474
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:31,279
like the hemp issue could be one of the

475
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:33,440
last strong divides that we face as a a

476
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:34,798
body of people in America. One everybody

477
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,600
seems to have an opinion. Everybody

478
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:39,679
seems so upset.

479
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:41,918
The hemp issue is the place where you

480
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:43,759
can draw the line. And uh anyone who's

481
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:45,840
watching this program in in your city,

482
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:47,919
there's obviously a uh a channel which

483
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:49,439
is carrying this message, get in touch

484
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:52,320
with the people that are producing this

485
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:54,240
show in your locality. And uh start

486
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:56,798
embarrassing your local politicians by

487
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:59,200
asking them, for example, of of your

488
00:19:56,798 --> 00:20:00,720
congressmen and assembly men and women,

489
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,600
how many of you smoked marijuana when

490
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:06,000
you were young? Huh? We know that about

491
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:08,558
80% of the members of Congress under the

492
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,798
age of 50 were smoking marijuana. How

493
00:20:08,558 --> 00:20:12,720
come they could do it? and we can't do

494
00:20:10,798 --> 00:20:14,798
it. There's even been reported rumors

495
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,798
that people all the way up to the White

496
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:20,079
House may have been involved too. White

497
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:22,798
Oh my god. We do know that Ronald Reagan

498
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:24,480
u u smoked marijuana because that came

499
00:20:22,798 --> 00:20:26,960
out in the book by Kitty Kelly when

500
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,640
Ronald Reagan was governor of California

501
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:31,200
used to smoke marijuana and and you know

502
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:33,200
when you think about it when you think

503
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,840
about it that explains everything about

504
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:38,558
poor Ronnie Reagan. It shows you why

505
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:40,558
Republicans should not smoke marijuana.

506
00:20:38,558 --> 00:20:42,240
Why is that? Well, the amnesia, you

507
00:20:40,558 --> 00:20:44,960
know, the forgetfulness, the short-term

508
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,400
memory loss, the cheerful, hey, what's

509
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,159
wrong, baby? Everything's fine, even

510
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,880
though the the country's going down.

511
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:53,280
Yeah. Okay. The the long naps after

512
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:56,799
lunch, you know. I mean, Ronnie, come

513
00:20:53,279 --> 00:21:00,399
on. Leave marijuana alone. No, by the

514
00:20:56,798 --> 00:21:03,279
way, both Ronnie's children, um, Ron Jr.

515
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:05,280
and Betty Davis, uh, of course, kind of

516
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:07,759
silly. The point I'm making here about

517
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:11,038
the place I think to take a stand,

518
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:12,480
abortion rights is one place, but

519
00:21:11,038 --> 00:21:14,319
marijuana and you can do it. The way to

520
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:17,839
do it is through humor. Write letters to

521
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:20,079
the editor. Uh challenge uh politicians

522
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:21,599
as to whether they really think that

523
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:24,158
alcohol is more dangerous than

524
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:26,798
marijuana. And if so, why? and uh on a

525
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:29,679
very common sense, logical, friendly, uh

526
00:21:26,798 --> 00:21:32,960
humorous. Uh you've always been one for

527
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:34,880
the wit and to tickle people with a

528
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,798
laugh and make them think. I've noticed

529
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:39,360
you do what you can to stimulate the

530
00:21:36,798 --> 00:21:40,798
mind in a fun way. That's the aim of the

531
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:42,439
game. I think that's oftenimes why

532
00:21:40,798 --> 00:21:45,119
you've been so misconstrued by your

533
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:47,120
contemporaries. They they can't take a

534
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:49,359
joke.

535
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:52,399
Well, uh good. I'm glad I misunderstood.

536
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:54,479
Um the uh the number one way to bring

537
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:57,200
down any repressive authoritarian regime

538
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:59,839
is irreverence and I pride myself I

539
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:02,960
think I have a very high IQ that is

540
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:05,439
irreverence quotient and I have been a

541
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:08,480
leading denter in this country uh during

542
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,840
the uh the uh Johnson administration

543
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,558
during the Nixon administration I'm

544
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:13,918
proud to have been I'm proud that

545
00:22:12,558 --> 00:22:15,359
Richard Nixon called me the most

546
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:17,640
dangerous man in America I mean after

547
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:21,199
all what an honor and yeah

548
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:24,080
really And I want to uh urge those of

549
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:26,480
you who just think for yourself. And u

550
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:28,639
the hemp issue is a wonderful issue to

551
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,798
bring people together because it it

552
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:33,200
brings together ecology. It brings

553
00:22:30,798 --> 00:22:35,679
together a substitute for petroleum

554
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:37,759
which of course is the real Republican

555
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:41,679
addictive drug. It's such an

556
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:44,240
ecologically uh helpful situation. Uh

557
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:47,038
above all, it prevents us from cutting

558
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:51,120
down the Amazon rainforest for wood pulp

559
00:22:47,038 --> 00:22:53,359
because or for um or cutting down for

560
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:57,279
fiber because we all know that hemp is

561
00:22:53,359 --> 00:22:59,519
by far the best uh material. So that

562
00:22:57,279 --> 00:23:01,918
there's something that's very wonderful

563
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:04,000
about a plant and and that human beings

564
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:06,000
kind of rally behind a plant. those five

565
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,640
wonderful leaves that kind of represent

566
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:12,359
uh wonderful and the great thing about

567
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:15,038
it is the rightwing Republicans and the

568
00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:16,639
right-wing religious fanatics hate it

569
00:23:15,038 --> 00:23:19,440
and you know why they hate it because it

570
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:23,600
makes people feel free and makes feel

571
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:26,320
people free feel uh funny and and

572
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:27,439
independent and u now I would if they if

573
00:23:26,319 --> 00:23:28,960
they hate it it's got to be something

574
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,720
good about it that's my logic I would

575
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,798
shoot myself if I didn't ask this one

576
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,880
last question and that is oh my god

577
00:23:32,798 --> 00:23:36,639
don't I know cuz so many people say you

578
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:39,600
had Timothy Liry there why didn't you

579
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:41,280
ask him in tried to shy away from the

580
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:44,399
recreational uses so we don't want to

581
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:48,639
make it a long respond but do you feel

582
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:51,280
that when consumed as a recreational uh

583
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,960
plant that it can bring you more in tune

584
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:54,720
with your own being with your own self

585
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,400
maybe put things into better perspective

586
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,640
or is it like liquor when you drink it

587
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:01,280
you're just so out of touch that you

588
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:03,360
don't know what's going on well I spent

589
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:04,918
40 years scientifically studying the

590
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:08,639
various botanical

591
00:24:04,919 --> 00:24:12,400
vegetable gifts that the plant queendom

592
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:14,240
has given the mamlian animal kingdom and

593
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:16,640
there's no question in my mind that uh

594
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:19,159
the mushrooms and marijuana are the

595
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:22,840
greatest gifts given to us by the

596
00:24:19,159 --> 00:24:26,559
vegetable the plant the

597
00:24:22,839 --> 00:24:28,918
kingdom you can misuse marijuana

598
00:24:26,558 --> 00:24:32,879
uh it does make you

599
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:34,880
uh there are like three dangerous Side

600
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,799
effects of marijuana. One is you kind of

601
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:39,200
see too much and that makes you kind of

602
00:24:36,798 --> 00:24:42,879
a little uh a little spacey because you

603
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:44,480
know you you're you just do see so much.

604
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,000
And the second is short-term memory

605
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,159
loss. Like you forget what you were

606
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:51,400
talking about. And the third dangerous

607
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:54,960
side effect. I

608
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:56,640
forget. No. Um don't ever smoke

609
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,480
marijuana. Use marijuana. If you have if

610
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,759
you're going to go to school, uh if

611
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,759
you're going to do anything that

612
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:04,720
requires attention, concentration, just

613
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:07,200
absolutely stupid, do not use marijuana.

614
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:10,960
Marijuana should be used for moments of

615
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:12,880
u of uh of real celebration and of

616
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:15,120
glorification. And the one thing about

617
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,240
marijuana is it's not a loner. It's it's

618
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:18,319
something that you do with somebody

619
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,319
else. Okay. The idea that someone go off

620
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:22,720
and smoke marijuana by themselves, I

621
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:24,079
mean, it's ridiculous. Kind of like kind

622
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,159
of like doing this talk show that we've

623
00:25:24,079 --> 00:25:27,519
had the chance to do today. Yeah, I want

625

626
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:35,200

627
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:36,480

628
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,000

our minds. Well, I'm all behind your

630

641
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,759
friends about it. If you are a victim of

642
00:26:01,038 --> 00:26:05,119
this uh war on drugs and feel that

643

647
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:15,120
need to be focused on, please let us

648
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:16,719
know. And if you have a challenge

649
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:19,439
regarding any of our statements,

650
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:21,679

651
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:24,558
to anybody who comes on to this show and

652
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:26,240
disproves our findings. Jack Harer

653
00:26:24,558 --> 00:26:28,519
stands behind that statement. It's an

654
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:31,120
honor to have him on our show. And

655
00:26:28,519 --> 00:26:34,000
again, I'll look for you the next time.

656
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:34,000
Thank you.
