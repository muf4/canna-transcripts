3
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:12,689
sign that we're divinely supported and

4
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:14,039
although we're feeling number here there

5
00:00:12,689 --> 00:00:16,320
will be thousands of people that will

6
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:18,809
watch these recordings and this will go

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:22,109
out all over the united states to

8
00:00:18,809 --> 00:00:25,018
support the future medical programs that

9
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:28,170
are sure to happen my name is thomas

altruistic strain hunters in the 710

speakeasy I would like to begin my

14
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:41,250
remarks with three quotes these quotes

15
00:00:39,509 --> 00:00:43,649
have a common theme and this theme

16
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:45,058
essential to our mission in being here

17
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:47,969
today to speak to our state

18
00:00:45,058 --> 00:00:49,859
representatives these quotes come from

19
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:52,679
history and it is history that we must

20
00:00:49,859 --> 00:00:55,320
observe and be students of or risk to

21
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:57,269
lose everything including the great body

22
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:01,109
of knowledge we've evolved as a species

23
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:03,210
to create we are one our suffering is

24
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:05,368
shared and the people behind these

25
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:10,500
quotes are trying to get us to realize

26
00:01:05,368 --> 00:01:18,390
this be kind for everyone you meet is

27
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:20,879
fighting a harder battle plato i would

28
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:23,489
rather make mistakes and kindness and

29
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:29,789
compassion than work miracles and

30
00:01:23,489 --> 00:01:32,789
unkindness and hardness mother teresa if

31
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:36,320
you want others to be happy practice

32
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:39,868
compassion if you want to be happy

33
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:43,949
practice compassion this was said by the

34
00:01:39,868 --> 00:01:47,188
Dalai Lama compassion is a facet of

35
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:49,350
respect respect is a facet of acceptance

36
00:01:47,188 --> 00:01:51,539
acceptance is needed to live in a

37
00:01:49,349 --> 00:01:54,209
pluralistic society where individual

38
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:57,840
choices are respected assuming they do

39
00:01:54,209 --> 00:01:59,819
not infringe on others compassion is

40
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,530
what is missing from this trajectory of

41
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:04,529
onerous regulation and overreaching

42
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:06,978
bureaucracy being Act enacted on the

43
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:09,659
backs of the sick and most impoverished

44
00:02:06,978 --> 00:02:11,939
we have been backed into a corner and

45
00:02:09,659 --> 00:02:14,219
can't help but rally here

46
00:02:11,939 --> 00:02:16,560
and bring our hearts and voices into a

47
00:02:14,219 --> 00:02:19,590
unified chorus that allows our adversity

48
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:22,319
to be observed and our opinions to be

49
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:25,590
acknowledged for those of us who voted

50
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:29,430
for proposition 91 we would like it and

51
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:32,939
acted as we voted for it for those who

52
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:35,640
did not vote for proposition 91 I'm sure

53
00:02:32,939 --> 00:02:40,740
you also would like the rule of law

54
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:43,979
upheld all cannabis is created equal all

55
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:46,159
humans are created equal we cannot be

56
00:02:43,979 --> 00:02:49,139
divisive and expect to exemplify

57
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:52,859
compassion as individuals or as a

58
00:02:49,139 --> 00:02:55,379
collective culture not a single human

59
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:58,170
can tell the difference between medical

60
00:02:55,379 --> 00:03:00,930
and recreational cannabis and is our

61
00:02:58,169 --> 00:03:03,869
internal physiological receptor system

62
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:07,920
that guarantees our right to this plant

63
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:11,129
and its inherent safety and non toxicity

64
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:13,649
not a single human has been harmed

65
00:03:11,129 --> 00:03:17,430
directly by cannabis in the history of

66
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:22,680
humankind let us remember now to be

67
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:25,980
students of history there is a vacuum of

68
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:27,930
leadership within our ommp program there

69
00:03:25,979 --> 00:03:30,689
is a vacuum of compassion and a vacuum

70
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:33,540
of usefulness patient dissatisfaction

71
00:03:30,689 --> 00:03:36,209
and disenfranchisement is at an all-time

72
00:03:33,539 --> 00:03:40,919
high and this leads to the grand

73
00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:43,590
question where exactly is the patient

74
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:48,389
advocacy and leadership within our state

75
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:50,670
program for this reason I would like to

76
00:03:48,389 --> 00:03:53,129
work with OHA to draft the patient Bill

77
00:03:50,669 --> 00:03:55,289
of Rights that guarantees a fundamental

78
00:03:53,129 --> 00:03:58,949
access and respect for individuals

79
00:03:55,289 --> 00:04:00,689
enrolled in our state ommp program for

80
00:03:58,949 --> 00:04:02,458
this reason I would like to work with

81
00:04:00,689 --> 00:04:04,979
the OHA leadership to create a

82
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:07,370
diplomatic patient group who can take up

83
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:10,439
roles to collaborate with the program

84
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:14,129
administrators and the employees to help

85
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:18,000
usher in a new era of program efficiency

86
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:21,870
and respect for patient privacy state

87
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:25,319
employees are drug screen for THC and

88
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:28,560
this alienates every single person

89
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:30,509
standing in front of me to hear this our

90
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,730
program is overly expensive and

91
00:04:30,509 --> 00:04:35,039
completely inefficient we lack

92
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:38,009
fundamental communication resources and

93
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:40,560
our renewal process is archaic redundant

94
00:04:38,009 --> 00:04:42,870
and offers no respect for housing and

95
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:45,629
tenant rights as well as chronic and

96
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:48,209
congenital disorders this current

97
00:04:45,629 --> 00:04:50,670
Olympian efficiency and provocative move

98
00:04:48,209 --> 00:04:54,149
for expansion originates from a

99
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:56,280
fundamental lack of compassion on behalf

100
00:04:54,149 --> 00:04:59,609
of our state representatives the

101
00:04:56,279 --> 00:05:02,369
polarity of compassion is judgement this

102
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:05,550
notion of labeling humans as patients or

103
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:08,160
as users as divisive and judgmental and

104
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:12,930
creates unrest and inequality and

105
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:15,180
culminates in the form of a syntax let

106
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:17,689
it be known here and now that the death

107
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:20,730
of medical cannabis will be the official

108
00:05:17,689 --> 00:05:23,370
rebirth of sacramental cannabis

109
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:25,680
protected by our First Amendment the

110
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:28,980
body of us being familiar with being

111
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:31,889
forced underground will absolve our

112
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:35,759
patient and caregiver status and renew

113
00:05:31,889 --> 00:05:38,039
our citizen status where our activity is

114
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:42,569
perverse preserved in our founding

115
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:47,450
documents if nature is illegal freedom

116
00:05:42,569 --> 00:05:47,449
cannot exist thank you and bless be
