tough road for veterans dealing with the

00:00:23,559 --> 00:00:28,759

mean we' got mayhem out there as a

20
00:00:43,238 --> 00:00:47,519
result of the government programs gar Ry

21
00:00:46,198 --> 00:00:48,878

23
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:53,159
that in the news but I want to give you

24
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,920
an update the last year we've worked

25

00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:08,599
be harassed for using medical marijuana

32
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:10,798
outside the VA it's a simple thing to

33
00:01:08,599 --> 00:01:13,359
ask we're not asking for much just not

34
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,640
be hassled for using medical marijuana

35
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:16,759

40
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:30,879
being reissued in 2011 we do have a VA

41
00:01:29,078 --> 00:01:34,039
policy that allows veterans to use

42
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:35,959
medical marijuana in a state program and

43
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:38,240
not be harassed when they go into VA

44
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:40,000

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,759
ailments that veterans suffer from you

49
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,879
know there ailments that everyone might

50
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:53,200
suffer from at one point or another in

51
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:55,879
their life with some bad luck or just

52
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,439
maybe some age uh but you know veterans

53
00:01:55,879 --> 00:01:58,920
maybe suffer from these things at a

54
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:01,599
little higher rate you know

55
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:05,000
