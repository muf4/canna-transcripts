00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:04,799
The Godfather of hint movement who

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:08,679
really began this movement I guess in

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:11,480
the early 70s uh has taught us all um

4
00:00:08,679 --> 00:00:13,519
Jack died this last year and I was uh

5
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:16,359
lucky enough to be able to do his eulogy

6
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:18,278
or be one of the people at his eulogy

7
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:20,000
and I made up my mind when I knew I was

8
00:00:18,278 --> 00:00:22,278
going to come out here I wanted to

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,640
dedicate my travel and my appearance on

10
00:00:22,278 --> 00:00:26,920
this show to my good friend Jack car and

11
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,560
I wrote a eulogy about him for those of

12
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:30,519
you who do not know Jack car wrote the

13
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:33,799
emperor wears no clothes this is the

14
00:00:30,518 --> 00:00:36,759
where I remember Jack jackar is a social

15
00:00:33,799 --> 00:00:38,878
and philosophical tsunami the ripples

16
00:00:36,759 --> 00:00:40,920
from whose Splash will forever Grace the

17
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:43,759
shores of human consciousness in every

18
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:45,439
freedom loving Nation he is a grand

19
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:47,920
champion of we the people and the

20
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:49,718
natural cycle in our battle with the

21
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,800
synthetic subversion which threatens the

22
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:54,800
very concept of the sovereignty of each

23
00:00:51,799 --> 00:00:57,238
human individual Jack's tireless efforts

24
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:58,799
to eliminate the facts about cannabis

25
00:00:57,238 --> 00:01:00,320
have furnished Freedom Fighters

26
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:02,399
everywhere with the tool TOS of

27
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,799
knowledge with which to resist the

28
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,799
fascism of the corporate State as it

29
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,960
seeks to subject everyone to its

30
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:12,840
economic bottom line Jack recognized

31
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:14,759
that cannabis is indeed a gateway to

32
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,478
existentialism which enlightens our

33
00:01:14,759 --> 00:01:19,239
existence and is the basis of our

34
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:21,039
freedom of choice he also recognized the

35
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:23,399
miraculous powers of this herb for

36
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,479
healing and many sick and dying people

37
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,560
have found comfort in its use after

38
00:01:25,478 --> 00:01:30,200
reading his wonderful Manifesto the

39
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:33,560
emperor wears no clothes I am one one of

40
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:35,359
them Jack A's Grand Spirit may have left

41
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:37,759
his worn out body but he has entered

42
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:40,000
into the hearts and minds of millions of

43
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:42,040
us who will be forever grateful to have

44
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,840
been educated by his commitment to the

45
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:46,840
truth God bless you Jack Amen
