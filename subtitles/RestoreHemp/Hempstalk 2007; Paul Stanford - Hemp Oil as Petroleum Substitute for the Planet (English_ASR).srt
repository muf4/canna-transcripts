1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:05,720
so come about 1910 this guy named SCH

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,080
sidin according to research by Don

3
00:00:05,719 --> 00:00:10,199
worter started inventing a machine that

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:14,039
was like the cotton gin it dropped the

5
00:00:10,199 --> 00:00:16,640
labor involved in hip to 100 fold from

6
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:20,038
its previous price it went from I think

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:23,719
uh uh 50 cents a pound to half a cent a

8
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:26,599
pound and hip became incredibly

9
00:00:23,719 --> 00:00:29,239
inexpensive and when that happened the

10
00:00:26,599 --> 00:00:33,159
petrochemical industry was just starting

11
00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:35,759
to synthe ize petroleum to be like hemp

12
00:00:33,159 --> 00:00:39,558
seed oil and other vegetable oils to run

13
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:41,920
diesel engines and so at that time

14
00:00:39,558 --> 00:00:46,679
petroleum wasn't the predominant fuel

15
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:48,840
most people grew uh their fuels you know

16
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:51,079
their their uh illuminance they called

17
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,160
it for their lamps before

18
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:55,160
electricity and they'd eat the stuff

19
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:58,640
left over and with hip they called it

20
00:00:55,159 --> 00:01:01,358
GRL which uh was a pretty basic food

21
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,159
that uh was very high in the essential

22
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:06,280
fatty acids just like it is today it's

23
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:09,000
very healthy food but the petrochemical

24
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:11,759
industries realized that HP was their

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,879
main competitor that hemp produced three

26
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:17,599
times more seed oil than any other plant

27
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:20,239
out there and that's still true today

28
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:21,919
according to uh a study out of notra

29
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:24,879
Dame that was published in a magazine

30
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:28,359
called the Midlands naturalist back in

31
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:30,438
1975 this article is called uh feral

32
00:01:28,359 --> 00:01:33,478
hemp in Southern Illinois

33
00:01:30,438 --> 00:01:34,798
according to that study the wild hemp

34
00:01:33,478 --> 00:01:38,519
that was growing on the Riverside in

35
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:41,399
Southern Illinois produced four tons of

36
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:45,078
seeds when you take four tons of seed

37
00:01:41,399 --> 00:01:48,000
and you press it you get 300 gallons of

38
00:01:45,078 --> 00:01:50,559
oil now that oil is not only very

39
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,759
nutritious it can also be put right into

40
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,399
any diesel engine and with no conversion

41
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:58,359
to the diesel engine it can run your

42
00:01:55,399 --> 00:02:01,320
diesel engine now the other seed oil

43
00:01:58,359 --> 00:02:04,799
crops right now our

44
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:07,239
soybeans uh sunflower seeds and canola

45
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,360
our rape seed you you know it's grape

46
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:11,239
seed and then when they present they

47
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:15,680
call it canola oil each of those produce

48
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:17,680
100 to 120 gallons of oil per acre and

49
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,120
you know that's mainly what we're

50
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:23,360
driving today when we're driving

51
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:25,840
biodiesel Vehicles we're driving those

52
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,760
seed oils and it you know it runs the

53
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,598
diesel engin just fine as most of us

54
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:33,439
know but HP is three times more

55
00:02:30,598 --> 00:02:36,439
productive and the byproduct for

56
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:38,400
making oil from hemp is three tons of

57
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:41,039
high protein you start with four tons of

58
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,640
hip seeds you press it you get 300

59
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:48,000
gallons of oil and four tons of high

60
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:49,799
protein hip seed meal yeah so that's not

61
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,400
the only thing you get you know just

62
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:57,439
think if we just with that alone though

63
00:02:52,400 --> 00:03:00,360
if we grew all of our fuel from

64
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:03,000
hemp all those barrels of oil

65
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:05,560
for every barrel of oil there's 50

66
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,919
gallons there's going to be a half a ton

67
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,640
of high protein hip seed meal left over

68
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:11,958
to wipe out world

69
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:14,919
hunger and then there's another

70
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:17,479
byproduct the fiber byproduct you're

71
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:21,039
going to get about 25 tons of HP herd

72
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:23,479
fiber HP herds also make paper there's a

73
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:27,878
bulletin from the USDA back in

74
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:29,919
1916 USDA bulletin 404 by Lester Dewey

75
00:03:27,878 --> 00:03:32,479
it's called hip herds is a paper making

76
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:35,798
material and that report said that hip

77
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:38,280
produces four times more paper per acre

78
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:40,719
than trees well that's a waste product

79
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:42,959
when you're growing hip for seed oil and

80
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:45,000
that waste product can make most of our

81
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:47,360
paper needs and our building materials

82
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
you can glue that stuff together the

83
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,599
same way they glue together wood fibers

84
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
today and then the other byproduct not

85
00:03:52,598 --> 00:03:57,639
just is the herd fiber but also 6 to 8

86
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,438
tons of Bast fiber that's the highest

87
00:03:57,639 --> 00:04:02,878
quality plant fiber you can have

88
00:04:00,438 --> 00:04:05,959
it's made to it's used to make canvas

89
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:08,000
rope lace and linen and in fact a lot of

90
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:11,959
the antique Linens and laces out there

91
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,840
are made from marijuana stems from hip

92
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:16,720
uh

93
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:20,720
fiber and so your average acre of hemp

94
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:24,720
is going to produce 300 gallons of oil 3

95
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:28,520
tons of high protein hemp seed meal 25

96
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:31,360
tons of hemp Bast fiber for paper and

97
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:34,719
building materials and 6 to 10 tons of

98
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:37,240
him uh herd fiber actually the herd

99
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,160
Fiers is the 25 tons the bass fibers is

100
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,680
the 6 to 10 tons but the bass fiber can

101
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:43,280
be used to make canvas rope lace and

102
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:46,959
linen and I think it's the seed oil

103
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:49,799
that's the real key here and that when

104
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:52,359
we legalize marijuana and allow

105
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:54,918
unregulated Industrial Hemp to become

106
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:56,400
predominant again the petrochemical

107
00:04:54,918 --> 00:04:58,319
industries are going to lose their

108
00:04:56,399 --> 00:05:00,638
Market hold we're going to see a

109
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:02,759
decentralization of the economy we're

110
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:05,439
not going to see the money being sent to

111
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:08,080
the chics and the oil companies uh the

112
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:10,240
despotic governments around the world

113
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:12,038
that depend on it in Nigeria and the

114
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,759
Middle East we're going to see the money

115
00:05:12,038 --> 00:05:18,000
going to the farmers and to the local

116
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:21,600
economy and that's the key that's what

117
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,839
the petrochemical industry does not want

118
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,960
they want us to keep pouring our money

119
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:28,399
into their industries that are capital

120
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:32,439
intensive takes so much money to drill

121
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:34,879
for oil of us can compete and it takes

122
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:36,879
billions of dollars tens of billions to

123
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:40,159
refine petroleum into all the different

124
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:43,959
products we use to make from it today

125
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:45,880
but hip seed oil and hip you can you get

126
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:48,758
a a seed oil press for

127
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:51,000
$2,000 and any farmer can get all the

128
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:54,080
oil he needs to run his tractors feed

129
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,959
his family and ship the rest to to

130
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:58,000
support the local energy market and I

131
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:59,239
look forward to the day when that's

132
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,839
going to happen you know what we are

133
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:04,639
really here working for today is to end

134
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:07,279
adult marijuana prohibition we want to

135
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:09,960
end adult marijuana prohibition we want

136
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:12,598
to make it legal we want to see it where

137
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:14,918
it's legally sold to adults over the

138
00:06:12,598 --> 00:06:17,759
counter we want to see it where adults

139
00:06:14,918 --> 00:06:19,799
can grow their own with no license

140
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,680
whatsoever I mean why you know you don't

141
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,879
need a license to make your own beer or

142
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,478
wine it's only when you start selling it

143
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:29,240
that you need license so we want to see

144
00:06:26,478 --> 00:06:31,918
unlicensed personal cultivation we want

145
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:33,759
to see unregulated hemp right now you

146
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:36,560
look at the industrial hemp Market out

147
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:39,919
there and in Canada and Europe they're

148
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:42,160
limited to less than 1% THC in some

149
00:06:39,918 --> 00:06:45,000
cases half of a percent THC in their

150
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,960
plants what they do and that's why the

151
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,759
petrochemical industries really allow

152
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:51,120
that and support it because what they do

153
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:54,000
is they breed out the THC and by

154
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:57,160
breeding out the THC they breed out the

155
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,839
flowers by breeding out the flowers

156
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:02,240
They're breeding out the seeds and

157
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:04,758
that's the food and the protein that hip

158
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:08,400
should be making and when we restore it

159
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:11,160
to its natural place we're going to see

160
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:13,519
a boom for all of our Farmers for all

161
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:15,560
our local economies and the

162
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:18,038
decentralization of wealth as it should

163
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:20,439
be I think

164
00:07:18,038 --> 00:07:22,478
so that's the dream and that's what

165
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:24,918
we're working for to restore industrial

166
00:07:22,478 --> 00:07:27,318
hemp and to help medical marijuana

167
00:07:24,918 --> 00:07:29,680
patients and I think you know we've got

168
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:31,639
our clinics and they've done a lot to

169
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:34,199
help us get this thing going but I look

170
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:36,598
forward to the day when our clinics are

171
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:38,680
put out of business by legal marijuana

172
00:07:36,598 --> 00:07:40,560
and unregulated Industrial Hemp and

173
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:43,759
that's what we're working for we're

174
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:46,000
working to make it where our clinics

175
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:47,439
basically don't have a job anymore

176
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,598
because people can grow their own

177
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:52,519
without a license and uh that'll be a

178
00:07:50,598 --> 00:07:55,598
happy day and we're going to keep

179
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:55,598
working toward it
