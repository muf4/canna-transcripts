healthy that's okay we're One reform

11
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:36,960
movement when we start dividing

12
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:38,359
ourselves and being angry and calling

13
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,039
each other names and insulting each

14
00:00:38,359 --> 00:00:41,679
other because we don't degree on the

15
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:45,960
very fine points we're defeating

16
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:48,039
ourselves we're one one Union we're One

17
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,079
reform movement we don't always agree on

everything but this is one movement man

19
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,399
there's not like a bunch of reform

00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,558
i502 will be historic if it passes

23
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,640
it'll be

24
00:01:01,558 --> 00:01:05,399
historic and there's some folks that are

25
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:07,599
against it you know what they've got a

26
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,000
right to their

27
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:13,199
opinion and they and they've got a valid

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,719
perspective too we're one movement we're

29
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,280
going to have the folks from both camps

30
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:17,879
up here speaking because that's what

31
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:20,040
hempest is about getting all the voices

32
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:21,879
out there showing respect to everybody

33
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,799
treating everybody with dignity and

34
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:25,640
equal respect regardless of what the

35
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:27,600
fine points are we all agree on the big

36
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:30,439
thing we need to change the

37
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:35,158
laws so let's be one community

38
00:01:30,438 --> 00:01:35,158
