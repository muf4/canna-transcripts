1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,259
in Canada which is basically the only

2
00:00:02,759 --> 00:00:07,129
place in North America where you can

3
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:10,410
legally produce any hemp right now uh

4
00:00:07,129 --> 00:00:13,530
the main product is seed and the grain

5
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:15,900
that correct what's the use of the fiber

6
00:00:13,529 --> 00:00:17,519
that's produced is it the farmers

7
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:19,618
growing separately for fiber and

8
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:21,419
separately for grain in the initial

9
00:00:19,618 --> 00:00:23,189
beginning we were growing the taller

10
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:25,859
stature cultivars that came over from

11
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:27,240
mostly from the Ukraine but now that the

12
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:29,460
you know industrial hemp has been

13
00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:31,108
legalized in Canada since 1998 they've

14
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,090
developed breeding programs to actually

15
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:34,920
breathe for short stature cultivars and

16
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:37,710
that we wouldn't read ealing with a

17
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,210
fiber so we have with the hold up right

18
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:41,160
now is that we have a lack of decor

19
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:42,600
dication equipment and this is an

20
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:45,029
infrastructure that it's going to take

21
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,469
to actually decorticate the fiber so

22
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:47,969
you're getting the vast and the herds

23
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:50,429
separate for whether you're going into

24
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:52,260
animal bedding composite application or

25
00:00:50,429 --> 00:00:55,350
into ahem Creek or building pressboard

26
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:57,299
types of applications and also you're

27
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:59,280
not able to haul the vales completely

28
00:00:57,299 --> 00:01:01,948
across the provinces so you need to have

29
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,989
them really regionally located closer to

30
00:01:01,948 --> 00:01:05,700
where the grower groups are because if

31
00:01:03,988 --> 00:01:09,209
not it becomes an economical to be

32
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:11,010
frating bales on the back of trucks to

33
00:01:09,209 --> 00:01:13,319
facilities that are hundreds of miles

34
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:16,109
away is there a paper production going

35
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:17,789
on in Canada with that no no no there is

36
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:19,560
a little bit of fiber that is coming

37
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:21,930
into the u.s. to be made into some

38
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,519
artisan type papers but not on the scale

39
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:25,799
we need I mean it's a huge business

40
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:27,688
opportunity to recognize the fact that

41
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:29,340
there's a growing demand for the hemp

42
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:30,929
building now you have all these other

43
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:32,759
kind of interesting products and

44
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:34,290
mandates from companies to actually go

45
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:37,349
green and use these type of green

46
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:38,670
composites in their in their parts so

47
00:01:37,349 --> 00:01:40,438
it's an opportunity for somebody to

48
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:42,629
recognize the fact that you know we do

49
00:01:40,438 --> 00:01:44,578
have this production we have farmers

50
00:01:42,629 --> 00:01:47,039
that are looking for another venue of

51
00:01:44,578 --> 00:01:49,199
you know increasing the farm gate and

52
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,100
that's one of the major ways to do it is

53
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,100
to take this fiber
