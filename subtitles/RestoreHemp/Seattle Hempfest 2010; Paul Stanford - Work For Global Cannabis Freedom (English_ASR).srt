00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,000
reverend who was

12
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:42,718

being held without bail they're saying

14
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:48,160
he's never been arrested for cannabis

15
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:49,719
before or anything he's 61 years old

16
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:51,759
they're saying he's a danger to the

17
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:53,640
community and they won't let him out on

18
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:55,878
bail and they're holding him until next

19
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:59,558
April for a trial it'll probably be

20
00:00:55,878 --> 00:01:03,238
after that but uh Eddie lap spoken on

21
00:00:59,558 --> 00:01:08,599

10 years so we got to let our people go

23
00:01:08,599 --> 00:01:16,319
you know in marijuana

24
00:01:11,319 --> 00:01:18,719
prohibition about 32 years ago I went to

25
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:20,239
a rally that was much like this one

26
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:22,679
right in front of the White House

27
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:26,560
there's a White House smok in organized

28
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:29,079
by The yippies Dana Bei that got me

29
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:32,519
motivated and involved in the movement

30
00:01:29,078 --> 00:01:35,279
about 30 years ago I was a Washington

31
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:38,719
state normal coordinator and I helped

32
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:41,920
organize the state about

33
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:44,798
1984 I moved from Washington Oregon to

34
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,560
help the Oregon marijuana initiative and

35
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,040
we put an initiative on the ballot we

36
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:52,159
lost pretty

37
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:54,280
overwhelmingly but uh in 84 as well Jack

38
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:59,520
herrer moved to Oregon

39
00:01:54,280 --> 00:02:01,239
from Los Angeles thank you and he uh put

40
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:02,798
together book while working on the

41
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:04,679
marijuana initiative in Portland the

42
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:07,479
emperor wears no clothes he gave one of

43
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,759
his last speeches here last year in the

44
00:02:07,478 --> 00:02:12,520
heat of the

45
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:15,039
day but uh you know Jack's book

46
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:18,080
basically catalyzed us all changed us

47
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:20,840
all and Jack's book motivated Untold

48
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:23,480
scores of people get out there work for

49
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:26,360
Global cannabis freedom and restore

50
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:28,560
Industrial Hemp this book brought the

51
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:31,800
whole picture into Focus about hemp and

52
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:34,878
cannabis you know now know and to see

53
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:36,000
marijuana catalyzed me marijuana

54
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:39,199
motivates

55
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,318
me and I studied Chinese for a couple

56
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:43,919
years and went to school in China and

57
00:02:41,318 --> 00:02:46,518
started importing hip Fabric and hip

58
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:50,839
paper back in the early '90s and had a

59
00:02:46,519 --> 00:02:54,080
company tree-free Eco paper sold H paper

60
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:57,120
I started and continue to produce a live

61
00:02:54,080 --> 00:03:02,040
weekly television store show Cannabis

62
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:04,519
Common Sense plays on cable here in the

63
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:08,079
Northwest and I also started and today

64
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:10,280
run THCF the hyp and cannabis

65
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,959
foundation and in addition to being the

66
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:15,080
sponsors here perhaps most importantly

67
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:18,000
thf has helped almost

68
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:20,879
150,000 people all across the United

69
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,479
States from Detroit Michigan and

70
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:26,598
Marquette Michigan out to Kapaa Hawaii

71
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:28,959
and Hulu become legal medical marijuana

72
00:03:26,598 --> 00:03:30,359
patients where they can legally possess

73
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,158
use and grow

74
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,519
their

75
00:03:31,158 --> 00:03:36,519
medicine but you know what it goes much

76
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:39,319
deeper than this cannabis hip is deeper

77
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:43,039
than its incredibly long tap rout

78
00:03:39,318 --> 00:03:46,079
marijuana's deep you know cannabis H

79
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:49,318
catalyzed human civilization

80
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:52,439
itself marijuana jump started human

81
00:03:49,318 --> 00:03:55,438
civilization all archaeologists agree

82
00:03:52,438 --> 00:03:58,799
that cannabis was among the first crops

83
00:03:55,438 --> 00:04:01,799
purposely grown by people over 12,000

84
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:04,319
years ago people began growing hip and

85
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:08,360
its cultivation spread from the high

86
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:11,479
Himalayas of Tibet and uh Nepal and

87
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:13,799
Pakistan and Kashmir and it spread down

88
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:16,680
to The Valleys in the Yellow River

89
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:20,199
Valley in China the Wanga Valley and to

90
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:21,759
the tigerish rres valley in Iraq to the

91
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:23,800
cradles of

92
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,319
Agriculture you know marijuana could

93
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:30,520
very well be the whole reason that our

94
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:32,519
ancestors gave up hunting and gathered

95
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:35,319
and started agricultural settlement so

96
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:39,000
they could have their

97
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:42,199
stashed and I believe the Cannabis is

98
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:46,160
the most sacred gift from the Creator to

99
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:49,319
us Humanity cannabis is the holiest of

100
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:52,520
the Holy gifts from our mother earth

101
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:55,399
every part of cannabis hip is highly

102
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:57,918
useful for the diverse multitude of our

103
00:04:55,399 --> 00:05:00,638
needs and the needs of human

104
00:04:57,918 --> 00:05:03,240
civilization there's only one one plant

105
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:07,800
capable of taking care of most human

106
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:07,800
civilization's needs and that's

107
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:12,959
marijuana when we restore marijuana to

108
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,680
its rightful place and Industrial hip to

109
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:17,319
its rightful place in our

110
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:19,959
economy we're going to see marijuana

111
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:22,399
Fuel and a great deal of our fuel and

112
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:24,359
energy needs are going to be made from

113
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:27,359
the seeds of

114
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:31,160
marijuana marijuana seed oil run any

115
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:33,800
diesel engine the mar stems produce most

116
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:37,120
of our fiber can produce most of our

117
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:40,120
fiber for clothing paper building

118
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,319
materials and it wipe out

119
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:45,199
deforestation and stop a great deal of

120
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:47,319
our pollution hydration hip seeds

121
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:50,680
produce more and healthier oil and

122
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:52,919
protein hip protein and oils are rich in

123
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:55,038
the essential fatty acids or the efas

124
00:05:52,918 --> 00:05:58,519
that our brain and cardiovascular system

125
00:05:55,038 --> 00:06:01,719
need marijuana seeds make omega 3 six

126
00:05:58,519 --> 00:06:04,879
and n be the perfect ratio for human

127
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:07,840
health and hip protein for marijuana

128
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:10,199
seeds makes all eight of the amino acids

129
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:12,560
that our body needs again in just the

130
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:15,199
right ratio for human

131
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,360
health when marijuana seed oil ages and

132
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:20,160
goes ran it it's no longer useful for a

133
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:22,479
food but it's a productive biodiesel

134
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:25,080
fuel you can take that oil for right

135
00:06:22,478 --> 00:06:26,839
into any diesel engine and it's going to

136
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:29,598
run it with no conversions the engine

137
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:31,959
are the fuel and you can synthesize it

138
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:35,199
into gasoline and plastic and anything

139
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:37,839
petroleum can make it's not only healthy

140
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:41,080
for us it can solve our world energy

141
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:41,079
problems wipe out a lot of

142
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:46,479
pollution the hemp stocks the stems are

143
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:49,400
the most productive source of fiber on

144
00:06:46,478 --> 00:06:52,240
Earth making 10 tons of bass fiber for

145
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:54,079
canvas rope lace and linen and 25 tons

146
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:57,840
of herd fiber for paper and building

147
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:59,598
materials per acre way back in 1916 the

148
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:02,239
United States Department of Agriculture

149
00:06:59,598 --> 00:07:04,839
put out a bulletin bulletin 404 said a

150
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:07,319
waste product for making canvas rope

151
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:10,439
lace and linen from him that waste

152
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:13,479
product makes four times more paper than

153
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:16,598
the most productive tree

154
00:07:13,478 --> 00:07:20,360
species the US Department of Agriculture

155
00:07:16,598 --> 00:07:23,199
back here in World War I put out a video

156
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:26,160
called hemp for victory they showed

157
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:28,960
Farmers how to reintroduce him it's

158
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,720
available on YouTube and that's just the

159
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:33,038
steeve seeds in the

160
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:36,080
stems you know we need these seeds in

161
00:07:33,038 --> 00:07:38,759
the stems don't throw them away but then

162
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:40,800
we have the flowers hi flowers make

163
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:42,720
human brain chemicals or

164
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:46,720
