1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:04,559
I'm an occupational safety and health

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,399
professional I've worked in various

3
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:09,000
Industries including Aerospace

4
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:12,638
manufacturing nuclear pellet

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,440
manufacturing uh nuclear uh weapon

6
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:16,839
demilitarization Etc uh as a safety

7
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:19,079
professional over the years I looked at

8
00:00:16,839 --> 00:00:21,118
various material safety data sheets I

9
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:23,038
found there is no threshold limit value

10
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:24,920
for marijuana there is no permissible

11
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,679
exposure limit for marijuana there is no

12
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:28,960
amount of marijuana they can consume

13
00:00:26,678 --> 00:00:31,959
that will cause

14
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,960
death

15
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,920
ever since I read the book marijuana is

16
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,440
safer so why are we driving people to

17
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,200
drink by Steve Fox Paul arm andano Mason

18
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:42,718
vert with forward by retired Seattle

19
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,840
police chief Norm Stamper I've been

20
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,879
trying to spread the message that

21
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,879
marijuana is safer than

22
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:52,479
alcohol I see a lot of people in the

23
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:54,878
audience wearing safer

24
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:57,839
shirts you can see that some people make

25
00:00:54,878 --> 00:01:00,679
their own safer shirts using stencils

26
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,800
that's part of what I do is I

27
00:01:00,679 --> 00:01:03,640
legalizing marijuana is more important

28
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:07,359
than

29
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:07,359
me and as you can

30
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:15,759
see when you take the selfishness out of

31
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:15,759
it it can

32
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:28,280
grow some of the best pot I've ever seen

33
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:28,280
was not grown for selfish

34
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,920
reasons was growing for people who

35
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:36,399
needed

36
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:37,840
it ever since 5052 passed we have a

37
00:01:36,399 --> 00:01:41,280
limited amount of

38
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:46,600
time where we can still grow our own and

39
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:49,718
share with Grandma it's okay Jared do it

40
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:52,158
so please call your lawmakers and tell

41
00:01:49,718 --> 00:01:55,919
them to undo

42
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:58,159
5052 look at our 76 no we have a table

43
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,560
here we should have the initiative ready

44
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,960
to go soon

45
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,719
you don't have to collect as many

46
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:06,879
signatures on a referendum as you do on

47
00:02:03,718 --> 00:02:09,878
a petition so that's nice they do have

48
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:13,239
to be printed on 11 by 17 double-sided

49
00:02:09,878 --> 00:02:14,919
paper uh 20 signature sheets we may have

50
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:17,560
some three signature sheets or four

51
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:19,679
signature sheets with mail in

52
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:23,039
capabilities but yeah we need to undo

53
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,959
5052 call your lawmakers participate in

54
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:29,479
the

55
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:29,479
