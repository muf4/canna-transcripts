1
00:00:01,159 --> 00:00:08,359
1959 many years ago I was a sophomore in

2
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:10,599
medical school and I was Smitten by an

3
00:00:08,359 --> 00:00:13,838
inappropriate stroke of

4
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:17,439
curiosity when I read a selection in a

5
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:21,518
textbook called Goodman and Gilman about

6
00:00:17,439 --> 00:00:25,480
cannabis which uh threed my curiosity

7
00:00:21,518 --> 00:00:28,079
because it was prohibited but medically

8
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:30,960
it sounded as if it was pretty

9
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:33,759
benign this curiosity led me to read

10
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,719
everything in the medical school library

11
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:37,439
and then

12
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:39,359
eventually uh permitted me to infiltrate

13
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:42,000
to the heart of the

14
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:45,320
beasts the National Institute of Mental

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,878
Health where I was hired as a research

16
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:51,480
psychiatrist to study

17
00:00:47,878 --> 00:00:55,799
cannabis at this time cannabis uh was

18
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:59,558
seen as a real threat to society because

19
00:00:55,799 --> 00:01:00,558
in 1967 when I was there all hell was

20
00:00:59,558 --> 00:01:04,158
breaking

21
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:07,519
loose with uh Lyndon B Johnson trying to

22
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:12,759
keep up the pretext of

23
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:14,560
U patriotism as he moved forward on the

24
00:01:12,759 --> 00:01:16,439
war in

25
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:20,079
Vietnam and

26
00:01:16,438 --> 00:01:23,199
uh the anti-war demonstrations were just

27
00:01:20,078 --> 00:01:27,199
tremendous in scope I just wish we would

28
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:29,200
see these kinds of re protests again but

29
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,640
marijuana was seen as something

30
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,680
dangerous

31
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:36,560
that was being adopted by subversive

32
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,840
organizations like California

33
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,600
communes and they saw the end of

34
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:44,520
civilization coming

35
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:47,519
near because the the legal governance

36
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:51,399
was breaking down as they sent more and

37
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:54,399
more young men off to be killed in

38
00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:57,159
Vietnam unfortunately I came out to

39
00:01:54,399 --> 00:02:00,478
California and ended up

40
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:04,880
defecting and there I

41
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:04,879
fled and did my practice of

42
00:02:05,039 --> 00:02:09,719
Psychiatry until things started

43
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:13,039
happening in

44
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:17,239
California it happened starting in u the

45
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:20,318
ha in the hay Ashbury and in the Castro

46
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:23,400
in the response to the AIDS

47
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:26,318
epidemic where different kinds of

48
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:29,159
effective medicines were unknown but

49
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:33,359
what was discovered was Cannabis would

50
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:35,560
prevent no and vomiting and pre permit

51
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:40,280
the use of different kinds of medicines

52
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:44,680
for treating AIDS and the

53
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:46,519
chemotherapy well this snowball and what

54
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:50,239
started in the

55
00:02:46,519 --> 00:02:52,959
Castro was taken under the wing of the

56
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:56,878
political pros and we went

57
00:02:52,959 --> 00:03:01,840
Statewide and we passed proposition

58
00:02:56,878 --> 00:03:04,318
215 two years later uh it same kind of

59
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:07,878
thing passed up here in

60
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:12,199
Oregon since that time I've had uh

61
00:03:07,878 --> 00:03:16,280
opportunities to uh evaluate over 11,000

62
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:18,318
patients for their use of cannabis and

63
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:22,280
what has impressed me is cannabis is

64
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:25,560
both safe effective and a viable

65
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:29,360
substitute for many medications used to

66
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:32,719
manage chronic illness that's far safer

67
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:35,840
and free from adverse effects

68
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:37,719
unfortunately the forces of evil namely

69
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:41,080
the greed of the pharmaceutical

70
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:44,400
companies coupled with the criminal

71
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:47,280
justice soree head losers don't want to

72
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:52,480
admit this to be a medicine and will do

73
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,479
everything they can to uh suppress it
