00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,259
of work and helped lab setup and

10
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:28,230
understand the regulatory reviews that

11
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:30,689
we need to improve this sector as we

12
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:32,850

19
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:49,829
is being heard we are picking up

20
00:00:47,369 --> 00:00:52,619
co-sponsors all the time from various

21
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:55,410
states and now we're looking at 27 or 28

22
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:57,299
it's pretty much changing daily states

23
00:00:55,409 --> 00:00:59,488
in the united states that have legalized

24
00:00:57,299 --> 00:01:02,750
cultivation of industrial hemp and thus

25
00:00:59,488 --> 00:01:07,289
then are qualified underneath section 77

26
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:11,368
267 606 of the farm bill pimp legitimacy

27
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:13,830
for research yes so eight states this

28
00:01:11,368 --> 00:01:22,049
summer cultivated industrial hemp in the

29
00:01:13,829 --> 00:01:23,938
united states eight states a lot of

30
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:25,860
people did a lot of work to make those

31
00:01:23,938 --> 00:01:27,779
eight states happen and a lot of people

32
00:01:25,859 --> 00:01:30,900
right here in oregon made that happen

33
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:32,340
also i personally assisted with the

34
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,680
project of a North Dakota State

35
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:36,810
University it's the one closest to my

36
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:40,140
heart because I had direct contact with

37
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:42,090
it we brought in 12 varieties from three

38
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:44,519
different countries and planted those up

39
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:46,680
in Canada I mean on the Canadian border

40
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:51,719
but in North Dakota those were from

41
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:53,490
France Canada and Australia the

42
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:56,700
collaboration from our international

43
00:01:53,489 --> 00:01:59,339
partners right now have been amazing to

44
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:01,680
work with us to import their cultivars

45
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:03,210
and Stewart their varieties here in the

46
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,310
United States really gives us an

47
00:02:03,209 --> 00:02:06,709
opportunity to

48
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:08,719
use what is known and have the data to

49
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:11,900
compare to to look at yields for

50
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:14,150
instance because without the farmer we

51
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:18,409
don't have the cultivation of industrial

52
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:23,659
hemp so everybody thank a farmer because

53
00:02:18,409 --> 00:02:25,129
without them we have no food definitely

54
00:02:23,659 --> 00:02:27,079

edit credit hour course that you can

80
00:03:24,859 --> 00:03:30,409
take to get a university credit so

81
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:33,019
anywhere in the world you can take wse

82
00:03:30,409 --> 00:03:35,719

towards your university degree it's a

84
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:40,699
backcourt class so it fills a lots of

85
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:44,569
requirements you can take it at three

86
00:03:40,699 --> 00:03:45,798
o'clock in the morning I don't care so

87
00:03:44,568 --> 00:03:47,839
and that's right here at Oregon State

00:03:45,799 --> 00:03:49,579
University so if you see what's also

89
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,609
driven here and that came through the

90
00:03:49,579 --> 00:03:55,540
renewable materials division so now

91
00:03:52,609 --> 00:03:55,540
what's that

92
00:03:55,960 --> 00:04:00,189
oh I think if you're over 65 and you're

93
00:03:58,509 --> 00:04:02,560
a resident of Oregon you can take it for

94
00:04:00,189 --> 00:04:04,960
like twenty five dollars any of the

95
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,909
eCampus extension services classes so

96
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:08,379
that's all right here so what's next

97
00:04:06,909 --> 00:04:10,240
well we're already planning for the

98
00:04:08,379 --> 00:04:11,859
cultivation trials next year and part of

99
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:13,450
that is getting all of the DEA

100
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:15,330
permitting that you need to actually

101
00:04:13,449 --> 00:04:17,949
bring the seed in which Clues

102
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:19,660
phytosanitary import export

103
00:04:17,949 --> 00:04:21,250
documentation and you have to make sure

104
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:22,680
that every single one of those pieces of

105
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:25,870
paper of course are filled out properly

106
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:27,610
but the nice thing is is now with rules

107
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:30,370
that we have sitting in Congress and one

108
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:32,470
of those being the appropriations bill

109
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:35,110
which essentially is the budget for the

110
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:36,790
Department of Justice and in this budget

111
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:39,850
it says that they cannot contravene

112
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:41,920
section 7 6 06 of the farm bill which

113
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:44,020
means none of the fun one water the

114
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:46,449
Department of Justice can be used to

115
00:04:44,019 --> 00:04:47,829
stop the importation of industrial hemp

116
00:04:46,449 --> 00:04:50,229
seeds as long as they're done with the

117
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:54,209
proper paperwork into this country to

118
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:58,090
foster an industrial hemp industry here

119
00:04:54,209 --> 00:05:00,250
yeah and we are definitely fostering and

120
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:01,509
we are part of a global movement so if

121
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:03,069
you look about what's going on around

122
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:05,230
the globe right now with the growth of

123
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:07,089
industrial hemp in various different

124
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:11,980
languages and everybody coming to the

125
00:05:07,089 --> 00:05:15,310
table to want to help to grow that so as

126
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:17,970
we move forward we want to help support

127
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:20,259
groups that put on things like him stock

128
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:22,420
because without them we can our

129
00:05:20,259 --> 00:05:23,649
community will start to fall apart and

130
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:26,980
that's really important to get out and

131
00:05:23,649 --> 00:05:31,029
volunteer actually be good citizens and

132
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:33,430
help pick up her page right so I

133
00:05:31,029 --> 00:05:38,819
definitely go to vote him calm my name

134
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:38,819
is Andrea Herman and free the hemp seed
