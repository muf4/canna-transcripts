00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:09,320
partner Chris Williams okay if you guys

32
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:11,359
don't know who I am my name is Kristen

33
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:14,039
Flor and I am the vice president of the

34
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:16,599
human solution International because my

35
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:19,920
father he died a couple years ago a very

36
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:22,319
tormenting and nasty nasty nasty death

37
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,118
in federal custody Shackled to a

38
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:26,879
hospital bed because our plant is still

39
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:29,280
federally illegal so while we celebrate

40
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:31,399
all these laws we have a nasty federal

41
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,439
law that will shackle us and put us in

42
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,759
prison for the rest of our lives just by

43
00:01:33,438 --> 00:01:36,919
following these laws because they

44
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:38,840
contradict each other when my dad died

45
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:41,280
he died with broken ribs undiagnosed

46
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,680
colon cancer liver failure all kinds of

47
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,680
nasty things happened to him why they

48
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:46,280
kept my mom in prison as well and all

49
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:48,799
they did is own a company and follow the

50
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:51,439
state laws Montana his business partner

51
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,799
right here he went to trial the jury

52
00:01:51,438 --> 00:01:54,519
didn't even know he was a caregiver how

53
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,560
many people he helped because they don't

54
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:58,560
allow state laws in federal court my

55
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,600
dad's other two business partners

56
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,159
testified against him so how are we

57
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:04,438
going to end prohibition

58
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,159
2015 well we are not going to snitch on

59
00:02:04,438 --> 00:02:07,359
each other we're not going to cooperate

60
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,239
with the government and give them our

61
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:11,038
information in fact we're going to stand

62
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:12,878
up for each other we're going to go to

63
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:14,919
the courtrooms we're going to wear these

64
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:16,959
ribbons these ribbons that you see me

65
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:18,719
wearing that means that nobody deserves

66
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,319
to go to jail for a plant we're going to

67
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:22,639
wear them in the courtroom so the judges

68
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:23,679
the prosecutors and the jury sees them

69
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:25,318
we're going to know about our jury

70
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,080
rights that's your power to say not

71
00:02:25,318 --> 00:02:30,479
guilty if you think a law is bad and

72
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,160
you're a juror you have a right not to

73
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:35,000
only judge if the law has been broken

74
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:37,479
but to judge that law and if you think

75
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,479
it's a bad law you can say not guilty

76
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:40,840
and refuse to send somebody to jail for

77
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:43,000
a victimless

78
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:44,759
crime that's something they won't teach

79
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,519
you in schools that we have to teach

80
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:49,199
each other so we're going to end

81
00:02:46,519 --> 00:02:52,080
prohibition through one court support

82
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:54,158
two jury nullification and educating

83
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,000
about it and number three we're going to

84
00:02:54,158 --> 00:02:57,479
defend our prisoners we're going to

85
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,080
educate about our prisoners and let

86
00:02:57,479 --> 00:03:01,759
people know that they're working as

87
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:03,159
slaves for the top 1% of our nation in

88
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:04,359
private prisons and they are killing

89
00:03:03,158 --> 00:03:06,158
them if they can't work for them and

90
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:09,599
