00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:24,399
California in

10
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:26,480
1996 we put proposition 215 on the

11
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:29,439
ballot and legalize the medical

12
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,679
marijuana in the state and 2 years later

13
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:33,399
you guys came right up stepped up to the

14
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:36,079
plate and voted to legalize medical

15
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:38,000
marijuana here in Washington state so

16
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,960
you're like a little buddy up the hill

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,238
there that we just keep an eye out we

18
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,320
say come on and join us when you get the

19
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:46,839
chance I remember you know the march to

20
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,520
legalization It's a Long March it's not

21
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:51,440
a straight trip like a lot of people

22
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,000
think a lot of people in California

23
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:54,599
right now think that the way that you

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,039
legalize marijuana is that somewhere

25
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,640
there's a cliff and a cliff is legal and

26
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,079
and once that's illegal and then at some

27
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,320
point you're going to walk and walk and

28
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,679
to the edge of that cliff and you step

29
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,799
off and it's going to be a straight

30
00:01:02,679 --> 00:01:07,319
plunge right down right down right down

31
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,479
and you hit legalization I am here to

32
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:12,158
tell you that's not the way it works

33
00:01:09,478 --> 00:01:14,000
when you step off a cliff it's bad news

34
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:16,719
you're going to get hurt the way you get

35
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,719
to legalization is you take the steps

36
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:21,719
one at a time and you make the progress

37
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:23,280
forward for five years Jack ha and I

38
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:26,200
marched up and down the state of

39
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,239
California educating people to put the

40
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:30,400
California hemp initiative on the ballot

41
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:31,879
and we were never able to do it and we

42
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,040
were saying you know we got to get a law

43
00:01:31,879 --> 00:01:36,920
we got to get a law but then Along Came

44
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:40,439
proposition 215 and it wasn't all it was

45
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:43,200
just medical marijuana and we said well

46
00:01:40,438 --> 00:01:46,879
we'll do it and shoulder toosh shoulder

47
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:50,359
we took California back and gave it to

48
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:53,280
the people of California to have that

49
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:55,159
freedom with Dennis perona we fought we

50
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,879
struggled and then we thought well this

51
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:59,439
is nice a few people who have medical

52
00:01:57,879 --> 00:02:00,839
need they get in trouble or they get

53
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:03,038
busted they can go to court and they get

54
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,280
an offense and we said that's not enough

55
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:07,399
and so we went to the legislature and we

56
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,120
struggled and we went back year after

57
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:12,360
year for seven years in a row to the

58
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:15,159
legislature and then we got

59
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:17,120
sb420 that allows dispensaries to sell

60
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:18,120
marijuana for patients around the state

61
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,480
of

62
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,120
California and now here we are in the

63
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:24,919
great year of

64
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:27,800
2010 and we have proposition 19 on the

65
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:30,318
ballad in California Proposition 19 that

66
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:33,760
was the same number that the

67
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:37,318
legalization initiative had in

68
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:39,679
1972 we come back 38 years later and we

69
00:02:37,318 --> 00:02:41,598
get the same number like it's a sign

70
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,800
from the universe like it said the first

71
00:02:41,598 --> 00:02:46,439
time maybe you didn't do enough work but

72
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:49,840
now you've done the work now it's time

73
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:53,079
for history to change we are the fulcrum

74
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:55,920
the Pito in California ready to move

75
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:59,280
forward and it's not a leap into the

76
00:02:55,919 --> 00:03:02,359
void it is a step of modest change but

77
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:05,039
it's a step that will make the stigma go

78
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:07,879
away the big stigma that what's so bad

79
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:11,359
about marijuana well it's illegal

80
00:03:07,878 --> 00:03:13,959
November the 3D in California that may

81
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,640
turn out no longer to be true and then

82
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:18,920
I'm going to come back here and I'm

83
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:21,359
going to hear in 2011 that this very

84
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:24,119
state Washington and the people here

85
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,640
from the Hempfest coales and stood

86
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:31,759
together to step forward and legalize

87
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:31,759
marijuana here in Washington State

88
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:36,560
[Applause]

89
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,560
and so we've marched around the state we

90
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,319
do the million March for marijuana

91
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,680
around the world we take step by step

92
00:03:41,318 --> 00:03:45,158
forward into the future it takes a lot

93
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,159
of stuff and here's something you might

94
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:49,719
might not want to hear but it's true is

95
00:03:47,158 --> 00:03:51,438
it takes money like Hempfest needs your

96
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:54,280
money you need to put some money into

97
00:03:51,438 --> 00:03:56,560
hempest to have hempest if you want

98
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:58,759
California to legalize marijuana so that

99
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,360
you can legalize marijuana up here we

100
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:03,479
need some money to come down to

101
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:07,000
California to help Prop 19 money is the

102
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:09,878
oil of politics I'm not into

103
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,759
oil okay but when it comes time to

104
00:04:09,878 --> 00:04:14,959
lubricate the gears of Justice we C we

105
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:16,918
can't keep giving it our blood we have

106
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:19,959
to give it our money we have to give it

107
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:22,560
our sweat we have to lubricate history

108
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:26,000
