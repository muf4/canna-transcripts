Oregon Liquor Control Commission and

5
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:12,480
we're happy to host these meetings I

6
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:14,580

8
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:19,740
Arlington so eight of these meetings

00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:22,198
we've seen almost 2 000 people face to

10
00:00:19,739 --> 00:00:24,538

11
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:26,340
um the commission is happy to sponsor

12
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:28,439
these events to get out have an informal

13
00:00:26,339 --> 00:00:31,379
discussion uh to see what's going on

14
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:33,659
around the state to learn about your

15
00:00:31,379 --> 00:00:35,700
thoughts related to measure 91. we're

16
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:38,039
really trying to focus our conversation

17
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:39,960
on hearing from oregonians about those

18
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:41,878
things that we can control at the Oregon

19
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,100
Liquor Control Commission we don't

20
00:00:41,878 --> 00:00:46,378
control the taxes

21
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,480
the what is lecture controls that we

22
00:00:46,378 --> 00:00:50,820
don't control things like

23
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:52,558
um we don't we don't control the taxes

24
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:54,659
we don't control where the money is

25
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:56,280
going to go many of those kinds of

26
00:00:54,659 --> 00:00:57,779
things will continue to get questions

27
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,759
about we'll try and redirect those

28
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:01,320
questions and we may cut you off on

29
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:02,238
occasion but we don't want to cut you

30
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,260
off

31
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:06,420
because we don't want to hear from you

32
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:08,640
but we're going to cut you off so we can

33
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,079
focus on those things like marketing

34
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,060
packaging how you're going to obtain

35
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:14,099
your license how all those things are

36
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:17,400
going to work those things that we as

37
00:01:14,099 --> 00:01:19,140
members of the OLCC can really affect

38
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,939
you know this was a measure that was

39
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:24,960
passed by Oregon voters

40
00:01:20,938 --> 00:01:26,459
56 of the people said yes 44 said no and

41
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:27,658
as I've told people at every single one

42
00:01:26,459 --> 00:01:30,239
of these sessions

43
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:33,479
I voted no on measure 94.

44
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:35,879
and I I'm very clear and open about it

45
00:01:33,478 --> 00:01:37,920
and I made no bones about it but I'm

46
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:39,000
also the chair in the commission and as

47
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,280
the chair of the commission I have a

48
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,239
responsibility to put this measure into

49
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,640
place

50
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:46,919
in the in the right Manner and in a safe

51
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,019
and responsible manner for oregonians

52
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,820
we're not here to step on the air hoses

53
00:01:49,019 --> 00:01:54,000
we're not here to do those things the

54
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:55,258
voters have spoken so now is our time to

55
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
make sure that it's done the right way

56
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:59,099
and so

57
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,719
I want you all to be respectful of each

58
00:01:59,099 --> 00:02:02,519
other as we continue to move forward

59
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,078
we're here to gain information from you

60
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:06,420
and we're here to gain information from

61
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:08,038
all sides but the but the measure has

62
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:10,739
been settled and we're trying to get

63
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:13,439
solicit those responses from from people

64
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:15,060
about now how to put it in place

65
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:17,340
so let me give you the basics related to

66
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:20,819
measure 91. the measure was approved by

67
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:23,159
voters in November of 2014. it gives

68
00:02:20,818 --> 00:02:25,439
OLCC these five Commissioners the

69
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:27,780
authority to tax license and regulate

70
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:29,939
marijuana in the state of Oregon

71
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:31,800
there are four license types that were

72
00:02:29,939 --> 00:02:33,959
allowed under the measure those license

73
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:36,480
types include the producer or Grower's

74
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:38,520
license the processor license a

75
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:40,500
wholesaler's license and a retail

76
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:42,300
license so there are only four specific

77
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,560
types of licenses that were allowed in

78
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:46,019
the measure

79
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:48,780
licensees can hold multiple types of

80
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:50,700
licenses unlike alcohol where you can't

81
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:52,818
accept maybe if you're like a brew pub

82
00:02:50,699 --> 00:02:55,199
or something you don't get to produce

83
00:02:52,818 --> 00:02:57,199
distribute and Retail the alcohol

84
00:02:55,199 --> 00:03:00,479
generally

85
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:01,919
the rest of the basics the excise tax in

86
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:04,619
Oregon is paid at the grower level

87
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:07,619
unlike Colorado and Washington which

88
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:09,900
have taxes at multiple levels the tax in

89
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:11,759
the state of Oregon is paid only at the

90
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,860
grower level

91
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:16,620
the net revenue distribution is not

92
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:18,900
decided by the OLCC it can be changed by

93
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:21,539
the Oregon legislature but this is what

94
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:24,539
oregonians voted for in the measure 40

95
00:03:21,539 --> 00:03:26,039
percent to the common School fund 20 to

96
00:03:24,539 --> 00:03:30,179
mental health alcoholism and drug

97
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:31,979
Services 15 to the state police 10 to

98
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:34,560
cities for law enforcement of this

99
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:36,840
measure 10 percent to counties for law

100
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,539
enforcement of this measure five percent

101
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:41,580
to the Oregon Health 30 for alcohol and

102
00:03:39,539 --> 00:03:43,620
drug abuse prevention those were

103
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:46,159
included in the measure that oregonians

104
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:46,158
voted on

105
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:50,339
the ACT does not affect the Oregon

106
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:52,859
medical marijuana program

107
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:54,598
while there has been much debate related

108
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:56,879
to the Oregon medical marijuana program

109
00:03:54,598 --> 00:03:59,158
and whether these programs should be

110
00:03:56,878 --> 00:04:01,378
combined and those kinds of things

111
00:03:59,158 --> 00:04:03,060
the OLCC has no authority to act to

112
00:04:01,378 --> 00:04:05,219
combine programs or affect the Oregon

113
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:07,140
medical marijuana program there's some

114
00:04:05,219 --> 00:04:09,959
synergies in the program that we're

115
00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:11,279
we're interested in as the OLCC that we

116
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:12,539
have some probably will have some

117
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,219
recommendations related to the

118
00:04:12,539 --> 00:04:16,620
legislature we'll talk about some of

119
00:04:14,219 --> 00:04:18,358
those things later but just so people

120
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:20,340
are clear on where we're at with the

121
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:21,779
medical marijuana program we will ask

122
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:23,339
you some questions related to the

123
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:25,619
medical marijuana program and the merger

124
00:04:23,339 --> 00:04:27,779
not because we have any effect over that

125
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:29,759
but because the legislature knows that

126
00:04:27,779 --> 00:04:31,258
we're out here talking to oregonians and

127
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,300
they want our feedback as well so

128
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:36,120
they're using us as a sounding board

129
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:38,759
of what's going on the ACT allows a

130
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:41,459
homegirl of up to four plants and eight

131
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:45,360
ounces per resident beginning July 1st

132
00:04:41,459 --> 00:04:47,459
2015. the OLCC has no control over the

133
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,020
home girl Provisions we don't regulate

134
00:04:47,459 --> 00:04:51,180
the home girl Provisions there's nothing

135
00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:53,159
in the act that provides our ability to

136
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:56,819
regulate those provisions

137
00:04:53,160 --> 00:05:00,000
the ACT prohibits consumption in public

138
00:04:56,819 --> 00:05:01,740
you can't smoke in public you can't take

139
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,600
marijuana in public you can't eat

140
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:05,400
brownies in public you can't eat Edibles

141
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,620
in the public you can't do any of those

142
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:10,079
things in a public area okay there's no

143
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:12,000
provision for lounges or bars or those

144
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:14,879
kinds of things for marijuana

145
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,279
the ACT does not allow local governments

146
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:19,019
to tax marijuana I know that there are

147
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:21,239
over a hundred local jurisdictions in

148
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:23,639
the state who have passed measures that

149
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:26,038
are interested in taxing marijuana the

150
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:27,780
OLCC does not get to decide whether

151
00:05:26,038 --> 00:05:29,819
those local jurisdictions can tax

152
00:05:27,779 --> 00:05:32,038
marijuana that is something to be worked

153
00:05:29,819 --> 00:05:33,360
out either in the legislature or that's

154
00:05:32,038 --> 00:05:35,759
something to be worked out in the court

155
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,100
system but again we're not going to talk

156
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,960
the LCC is not going to talk about the

157
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:42,060
taxes we don't have anything to do with

158
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:44,279
that tax level

159
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:46,860
localities May opt out through general

160
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:48,538
election if 10 percent of the voters in

161
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:51,360
a give it jurisdiction in the city or

162
00:05:48,538 --> 00:05:54,180
county sign up put it on the ballot they

163
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:57,180
can't opt out of having licensees in

164
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:58,978
their jurisdiction all right it still

165
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:00,780
allows you know the Homegrown personal

166
00:05:58,978 --> 00:06:02,879
use and those kinds of things but they

167
00:06:00,779 --> 00:06:05,038
can opt out but many people don't know

168
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:07,439
is that you can also opt out a liquor

169
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:09,240
though we don't have cities and counties

170
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:12,379
in the state of Oregon who have opted

171
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:14,280
out of liquor but that's just a fun fact

172
00:06:12,379 --> 00:06:17,459
laughs

173
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:19,319
Federal considerations we have you know

174
00:06:17,459 --> 00:06:21,239
Federal considerations related to this

175
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:23,759
and you're all aware of this and the

176
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:25,860
OLCC is very aware of this marijuana

177
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:29,819
remains illegal under federal law all

178
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:31,699
right so it's a business risk right so

179
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:35,639
we just point that out to everybody

180
00:06:31,699 --> 00:06:37,379
however on August 29 2013 the U.S

181
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:39,180
Department of Justice issued guidance to

182
00:06:37,379 --> 00:06:40,918
the states that have legalized

183
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:42,720
recreational marijuana

184
00:06:40,918 --> 00:06:45,258
they've issued guidance under what is

185
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:48,780
called the coal memorandum

186
00:06:45,259 --> 00:06:50,759
c-o-l-e so the call memoranda provides

187
00:06:48,779 --> 00:06:53,159
the guidance to states that are putting

188
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:56,100
recreational marijuana into effect the

189
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:57,180
coal memorandum doesn't have the force

190
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,860
of law

191
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:00,418
it's merely an opinion of the U.S

192
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:02,639
attorney's Office under the current

193
00:07:00,418 --> 00:07:04,799
Administration Administration to

194
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,840
Administration could change that so it

195
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,759
doesn't have the force of law if you'd

196
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:11,959
like to look at the coal memorandum in

197
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:13,860
its original form go to

198
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:16,620
marijuana.oregon.gov and you can

199
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:19,620
download or look at online

200
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:19,620
okay

201
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:24,899
Federal guidance this is the main points

202
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:26,879
of the coal memorandum

203
00:07:24,899 --> 00:07:28,918
so the main parts of the cool memorandum

204
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:31,819
are to one prevent the distribution of

205
00:07:28,918 --> 00:07:31,818
marijuana to minors

206
00:07:32,038 --> 00:07:34,800
prevent revenue from the sale of

207
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:36,240
marijuana we're going to criminal

208
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,900
Enterprise

209
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,900
cartels

210
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,439
three prevent the diversion of marijuana

211
00:07:41,579 --> 00:07:45,598
from where it is legal under state law

212
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:46,978
to other states

213
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:49,019
so we don't want it going out of state

214
00:07:46,978 --> 00:07:51,418
no interstate commerce

215
00:07:49,019 --> 00:07:53,879
four perfect State authorized activity

216
00:07:51,418 --> 00:07:55,560
from being used as a cover for illegal

217
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:57,598
activity

218
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:00,000
we don't want to be growing things in

219
00:07:57,598 --> 00:08:01,259
the recreational market then la la all

220
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,360
of a sudden they're all over the country

221
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:04,800
so that's what they don't want to have

222
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,020
happen

223
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,400
five prevent violence and the use of

224
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:11,519
firearms and the cultivation and

225
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:13,918
distribution of marijuana

226
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:15,538
six prevent drug driving and other

227
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:18,719
adverse Public Health consequences

228
00:08:15,538 --> 00:08:20,759
associated with marijuana use

229
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,720
seven prevent the growing of marijuana

230
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:23,720
on public lands

231
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,780
and eight prevent marijuana use on

232
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:29,698
public property

233
00:08:27,779 --> 00:08:31,079
there's actually the eight kind of

234
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:33,500
principal points of what the coal

235
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:35,158
memoranda says but again go to

236
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:37,940
marijuana.oregon.gov to take a look at

237
00:08:35,158 --> 00:08:37,939
the original by yourself

238
00:08:38,278 --> 00:08:42,418
in order to meet the precepts of those

239
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:45,480
eight points from the coal memorandum

240
00:08:42,418 --> 00:08:47,819
both Colorado and Washington

241
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:50,339
and the state of Oregon is now looking

242
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:52,620
at right now and in the process of

243
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:55,320
preparing a request for proposal for a

244
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:58,019
seat to sale tracking system we don't

245
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:00,240
feel that we can comply with federal law

246
00:08:58,019 --> 00:09:01,019
without having to see the sale tracking

247
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,240
system

248
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:04,740
all right

249
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:07,560
I already said Colorado Washington

250
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:09,720
require it and the reason they require

251
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:12,119
it is so the taxes are cold properly

252
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:16,200
collected and that the inventory does

253
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:18,480
not migrate from the residential Market

254
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:21,600
into a black or gray Market

255
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,039
so that's the reason we have the seat of

256
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,959
sale tracking system

257
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:27,559
it's designed for more effective Audits

258
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:30,299
and to satisfy federal guidelines

259
00:09:27,559 --> 00:09:32,518
it's also for efficiency

260
00:09:30,299 --> 00:09:34,799
we can't have people going to every

261
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:36,959
recreational marijuana grow and whatever

262
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:38,759
and you know individually counting every

263
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:40,139
single plant we'd have a fleet of

264
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:43,319
Auditors we need to be able to go

265
00:09:40,139 --> 00:09:44,939
through and with the one with RFID tags

266
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,260
and be able to say how many plants are

267
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,399
here and what's going on and are they

268
00:09:46,259 --> 00:09:49,259
properly where they're supposed to be

269
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:51,720
and those kinds of things it's for

270
00:09:49,259 --> 00:09:53,458
efficiency not only for us but for for

271
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,379
the operations and that's what they do

272
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:56,278
in a lot of the manufacturing Industries

273
00:09:55,379 --> 00:09:57,899
today

274
00:09:56,278 --> 00:10:01,519
so we mentioned before there are only

275
00:09:57,899 --> 00:10:01,519
four license types that were allowed

276
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:07,319
those four license types

277
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:09,479
well we have more for alcohol

278
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:12,240
they're they're very restrictive in what

279
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:13,860
they do so the first type of license is

280
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,200
a producer license

281
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:19,019
it's only able it's only able to

282
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:20,820
cultivate marijuana it's responsible for

283
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:21,839
the payment of tax at the first point of

284
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,820
sale

285
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:25,920
so for example the commission had an

286
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:27,000
educational session today we're going to

287
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:28,799
make some recommendations of the

288
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,200
legislature one of the things that we

289
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:33,958
she has a potential deficit on the

290
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:36,240
producer licenses we don't be able to

291
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:37,679
have this you know kind of Farm to Table

292
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,200
kind of thing that we have on the food

293
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:43,019
products industry under the way the law

294
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:46,259
under the way measure 91 was written you

295
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:48,000
can't be a grower package it for retail

296
00:10:46,259 --> 00:10:51,179
and sell it directly to a retailer

297
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,399
you've got to have two licenses so that

298
00:10:51,179 --> 00:10:55,799
doesn't seem to make a lot of sense to

299
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:57,179
some of us and so that's something the

300
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:59,099
legislature would have to change but

301
00:10:57,179 --> 00:11:00,958
it's something that we as a commissioner

302
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:03,120
trying to look at

303
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:05,159
the processor license the processor

304
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,078
license packages and labels marijuana

305
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:09,360
items okay

306
00:11:07,078 --> 00:11:10,500
also it would be the manufacturer you'd

307
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,899
have to get this kind of License to

308
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:16,700
manufacture edibles

309
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:16,700
and extracts okay

310
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:20,100
in addition to that we have a wholesale

311
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:22,079
license

312
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:24,899
those people that buy and sell at

313
00:11:22,078 --> 00:11:28,259
wholesale so this is a required license

314
00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:29,759
but as as markets mature wholesalers

315
00:11:28,259 --> 00:11:31,679
come in

316
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:32,578
so that license is anticipated by the

317
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:34,500
measure

318
00:11:32,578 --> 00:11:36,778
and the fourth and final license is the

319
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:39,480
retail license it sells marijuana items

320
00:11:36,778 --> 00:11:42,000
that retail to adults over 21 years old

321
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:43,560
so that's the retailer that's the person

322
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,458
who's doing it

323
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:47,039
um

324
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:49,379
that's the one who sets up the shops so

325
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:51,120
but there are other licenses that the

326
00:11:49,379 --> 00:11:53,220
OLCC is considering asking the

327
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,259
legislature about doing you know one of

328
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:57,060
the things is testing we want we're

329
00:11:55,259 --> 00:11:59,159
interested in having testing but if you

330
00:11:57,059 --> 00:12:00,719
were a testing facility there's no way

331
00:11:59,159 --> 00:12:02,578
to get licensed to be able to hold the

332
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,500
marijuana out of the recreational system

333
00:12:02,578 --> 00:12:06,838
so those are some of the tweaks and

334
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:08,879
things that as the OLCC does its work

335
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:11,700
and as we work with the industry and we

336
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:13,078
work with everyone to understand where

337
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:14,339
we work with local government law

338
00:12:13,078 --> 00:12:15,838
enforcement those are all the things

339
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:18,480
that we want to make sure in the system

340
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:20,760
so that when your product's being

341
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,920
transported from your facility to the to

342
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:24,360
the test facility that it's in this seed

343
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:25,740
to sale tracking system so if somebody

344
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,180
gets pulled over by law enforcement or

345
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:29,100
something else happens you have a

346
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:31,919
manifest it's clear where it started

347
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:33,720
where it's gone where it's going and and

348
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:35,219
the plan through the system so that's

349
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:37,440
why we're doing what we're doing we're

350
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:40,519
doing it for everybody's protection and

351
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:43,680
transparency in the system

352
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:45,778
advertising packaging and testing these

353
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:48,299
are this is going to be probably one of

354
00:12:45,778 --> 00:12:51,720
the biggest and hottest areas related to

355
00:12:48,299 --> 00:12:53,519
where OLCC is going to be involved

356
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:56,459
the ACT gives us the authority to

357
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:58,799
regulate or prohibit advertising

358
00:12:56,458 --> 00:13:00,539
we can regulate packages and labels to

359
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:02,519
ensure Public Safety and prevent an

360
00:13:00,539 --> 00:13:05,399
appeal to minors

361
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:07,200
and we can adopt standards and testing

362
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:09,179
requirements

363
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,660
so this is an area where you know we're

364
00:13:09,179 --> 00:13:14,939
in new ground really we regulate alcohol

365
00:13:11,659 --> 00:13:16,799
alcohol is a federal it's regulated at

366
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:18,600
the federal level it all falls under the

367
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:19,799
Federal Constitution

368
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:22,860
so

369
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:26,578
the rules are kind of clear OLCC for

370
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:28,980
example we don't approve any of the beer

371
00:13:26,578 --> 00:13:30,719
and wine and alcohol labels that's all

372
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:32,820
done at the federal level so we don't

373
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,320
have the internal infrastructure at the

374
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:35,940
OLCC or the trained staff that's

375
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,620
familiar with those kind of processes

376
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:39,300
currently so those are some of the

377
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:41,339
things where we're going to be able to

378
00:13:39,299 --> 00:13:45,139
be seeking a lot of public input related

379
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:45,139
to those types of items

380
00:13:45,299 --> 00:13:49,979
impaired driving

381
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:53,100
the ACT does not identify a specific

382
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:56,039
limit for driving a blood level in it

383
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:57,899
both Washington and Colorado in their

384
00:13:56,039 --> 00:14:00,539
original measure past a blood level

385
00:13:57,899 --> 00:14:02,399
limit for impaired driving

386
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:05,338
does not have that

387
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:07,320
but I can tell you as a D.A we prosecute

388
00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:10,380
people on a regular basis all around the

389
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:12,720
state for drug driving so we currently

390
00:14:10,379 --> 00:14:15,539
have a system in place to deal with drug

391
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:17,639
driving around the state but the ACT

392
00:14:15,539 --> 00:14:19,559
does require the OLCC to examine

393
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:22,440
research and present a report to the

394
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:24,299
legislature related to impaired driving

395
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:26,459
in the state of Oregon related to

396
00:14:24,299 --> 00:14:28,559
marijuana so what are we doing we're

397
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:30,359
working with the Department of Justice

398
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:33,299
investigation Division and the Oregon

399
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:35,639
State Police to gather the data together

400
00:14:33,299 --> 00:14:37,078
to present that report so we're trying

401
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:39,419
to work with everybody local government

402
00:14:37,078 --> 00:14:41,159
but the state police is really the main

403
00:14:39,419 --> 00:14:42,958
place where all that where all that

404
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:46,319
information is gathered but we're

405
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:49,458
charged with that data collection and

406
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,459
implementation report

407
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:53,759
many people have asked what's the

408
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:55,500
timeline for implementation and I think

409
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:57,299
you've all seen stories coming out of

410
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,620
Washington and Colorado related to those

411
00:14:57,299 --> 00:15:00,120
things we're trying to be very

412
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:01,679
transparent with the public about what

413
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,659
their expectations are

414
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:06,059
we're trying to keep within the spirit

415
00:15:03,659 --> 00:15:07,980
this group is certainly uh very much

416
00:15:06,059 --> 00:15:10,198
into keeping it to the spirit of the

417
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:13,139
measure and keeping into the timelines

418
00:15:10,198 --> 00:15:16,679
but our commission also acknowledges the

419
00:15:13,139 --> 00:15:19,440
fact that when oregonians signed up

420
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:21,778
and put their signatures on the

421
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,579
initiative measure to get measure 91 on

422
00:15:21,778 --> 00:15:26,059
the ballot we also didn't have the

423
00:15:23,578 --> 00:15:29,099
experience of having two states legalize

424
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:31,259
marijuana so we also feel like we would

425
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:33,778
be remiss as a commission and I think

426
00:15:31,259 --> 00:15:35,458
the legislature feels the same way that

427
00:15:33,778 --> 00:15:39,240
we would be remiss if we didn't learn

428
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:41,518
from the what's been fared it out in

429
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:43,440
both Colorado and Washington

430
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:45,120
so we want to keep with the spirit of it

431
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,800
but we're going to go slow we're going

432
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,600
to do it the right way and we're going

433
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:50,159
to do it in Oregon's way we're not just

434
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,659
going to you know

435
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:53,338
they're all every single one of these

436
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:56,819
states is different

437
00:15:53,339 --> 00:15:58,800
January 1st 2015 personal possession and

438
00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:00,800
home production become legal in the

439
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:03,419
state of Oregon

440
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:04,919
that's uh that was in the measure and

441
00:16:03,419 --> 00:16:07,198
that's what's uh happening with personal

442
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:09,419
possession of Home production again the

443
00:16:07,198 --> 00:16:11,819
OLCC does not regulate personal

444
00:16:09,419 --> 00:16:14,639
possession and home production

445
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:16,440
March through 2015 we will begin to

446
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,399
notice rulemaking

447
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:19,560
um we're probably only going to be able

448
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:21,059
to put these rules in on a on a

449
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:22,619
temporary basis just because of the

450
00:16:21,059 --> 00:16:24,719
timelines to hit our January deadline

451
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:27,179
with ultimately a final rules package

452
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,278
coming forward but through March through

453
00:16:27,179 --> 00:16:30,899
October 2015 there will be plenty of

454
00:16:29,278 --> 00:16:32,100
opportunity what we're going to do is

455
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:34,078
we're going to graph a set of rules

456
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:35,639
we're going to get an Advisory Group and

457
00:16:34,078 --> 00:16:37,258
I'll go for more detail later but that's

458
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:39,419
what we're doing is Rule making March

459
00:16:37,259 --> 00:16:41,759
through October our hope is that by

460
00:16:39,419 --> 00:16:43,860
November of 2015 we will have a

461
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:46,320
temporary rules package in place so that

462
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:49,379
we can begin to tilt up the system

463
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:52,379
January 4th 2016.

464
00:16:49,379 --> 00:16:54,120
this measure requires us to as the OLCC

465
00:16:52,379 --> 00:16:56,698
to begin accepting applications for

466
00:16:54,120 --> 00:17:00,480
licenses so that's what it requires is

467
00:16:56,698 --> 00:17:02,099
April I mean January 4th 2016.

468
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,899
but what does that mean that means we've

469
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:06,298
got to start accepting applications for

470
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:08,220
licenses but that doesn't mean that

471
00:17:06,298 --> 00:17:10,199
you're going to be able to walk into a

472
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:14,519
retail establishment and buy marijuana

473
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:17,339
across the counter January 4th 2016. so

474
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:19,439
late in 2016 is when we believe retail

475
00:17:17,338 --> 00:17:21,240
sales will begin why do we believe that

476
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:23,279
well I think people watched what

477
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:25,318
happened in the state of Washington uh

478
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:27,599
they had this huge Spike because there

479
00:17:25,318 --> 00:17:29,519
wasn't enough product in the market and

480
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:31,139
there was huge costs and then it's

481
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:33,599
flattened out it's done all kinds of

482
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:36,419
crazy things remember we're this is a

483
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:38,339
this is an industry well well nobody on

484
00:17:36,419 --> 00:17:40,080
the commission does not believe we have

485
00:17:38,339 --> 00:17:41,759
a mature marijuana industry in the state

486
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:44,399
of Oregon we certainly do we certainly

487
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:45,720
have a brand and a reputation worldwide

488
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:49,080
related to the marijuana that's

489
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:49,079
currently we

490
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:54,779
that marijuana cannot come immediately

491
00:17:52,798 --> 00:17:56,339
into the retail system it has to be

492
00:17:54,779 --> 00:17:58,079
grown in the retail system and tracked

493
00:17:56,339 --> 00:17:59,759
in the seed to sale system there's got

494
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:01,859
to be a harvest cycle there's got to be

495
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:04,079
processing and packaging approval and

496
00:18:01,859 --> 00:18:06,779
then then retail stores can come online

497
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:09,960
so that's why we're saying realistically

498
00:18:06,779 --> 00:18:12,058
late in 2016 is when we begin to believe

499
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:13,740
something will begin to come online we

500
00:18:12,058 --> 00:18:16,379
also intend to process those

501
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:19,620
applications in order of you know

502
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:22,799
Growers and then you know producers and

503
00:18:19,619 --> 00:18:24,839
then retailers who certainly are trying

504
00:18:22,798 --> 00:18:26,400
to do that so that we can be efficient

505
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:29,579
so that we don't have some of the same

506
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,960
pitfalls in Washington Colorado

507
00:18:29,579 --> 00:18:33,659
all right

508
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:36,298
public engagement you're here you're

509
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:38,880
obviously publicly engaged but we have

510
00:18:36,298 --> 00:18:40,319
the listening tour again I can't stress

511
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,480
enough how many people have gone to

512
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:45,178
marijuana.oregon.gov

513
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:48,960
okay well if you haven't take a look at

514
00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:50,640
it okay uh volunteers with expertise in

515
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,038
the range of issues related to measure

516
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:56,160
91 so we're going to appoint a rules

517
00:18:53,038 --> 00:18:58,019
advisory commission to do that

518
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:00,419
um we're going to include law

519
00:18:58,019 --> 00:19:02,460
enforcement Insurance Chiefs DA's local

520
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:04,559
government cities and counties from

521
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:07,140
industry Growers processors testing

522
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:09,899
kitchen people in retail

523
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:11,340
the proponents of measure 91

524
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:13,919
and three other members of the public

525
00:19:11,339 --> 00:19:16,259
that's kind of our intent

526
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:18,679
at this point we

527
00:19:16,259 --> 00:19:18,679
questions

528
00:19:18,798 --> 00:19:23,220
clarifying not discussion oriented I

529
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:26,220
promise you we're going to have time for

530
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:28,140
that yes I've got a question on uh the

531
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:31,620
board here you you mentioned everybody

532
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:33,960
and you have a D.A a real estate agent

533
00:19:31,619 --> 00:19:36,119
an insurance agent you see no conflict

534
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:38,038
of interest with going ahead and setting

535
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:40,859
these laws in your case perhaps

536
00:19:38,038 --> 00:19:42,720
Prosecuting them sounds like discussion

537
00:19:40,859 --> 00:19:44,099
to be but go ahead and answer yeah can

538
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,259
you guys stick with clarifying right now

539
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:47,519
I don't I personally don't see a

540
00:19:46,259 --> 00:19:49,440
conflict of interest these are

541
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:51,179
recreational marijuana laws and rules

542
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,640
that we're putting in place

543
00:19:51,179 --> 00:19:56,759
um I don't see the insurance guys having

544
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:59,038
a conflict work you know we have no

545
00:19:56,759 --> 00:20:00,538
direct financial interest in it so and

546
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:03,660
they will be stopped from let's say

547
00:20:00,538 --> 00:20:06,000
selling real estate to people and uh for

548
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:07,980
the person that does sell real estate

549
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,960
and they will be stuck from selling or

550
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:13,400
having a list of people that can get

551
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:13,400
insurance from no

552
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:23,220
you mentioned that you'd be working with

553
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:26,220
the industry

554
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:27,960
is there a growers association involved

555
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:29,700
or is there a non-profit organization

556
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:31,500
that represents a growers association

557
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:32,660
like the wine industry the nursery

558
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:35,819
industry

559
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:37,740
there are several grower groups around

560
00:20:35,819 --> 00:20:41,399
the state we've had several of them

561
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:43,440
testify before as invited testimony

562
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:46,080
before our commission as well as the

563
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:50,038
legislative committee most of those are

564
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:51,659
private groups you know beer the beer

565
00:20:50,038 --> 00:20:54,298
people and the wine people have

566
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:55,860
something in statute that's distilling

567
00:20:54,298 --> 00:20:57,538
industry the craft distilling industry

568
00:20:55,859 --> 00:20:59,099
is asking for something statute this

569
00:20:57,538 --> 00:21:00,619
time this point time though marijuana

570
00:20:59,099 --> 00:21:03,480
does not have anything

571
00:21:00,619 --> 00:21:05,159
in place at that kind of state level but

572
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:07,620
I know that there are loose groups of

573
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:09,120
Growers around the state that we are we

574
00:21:07,619 --> 00:21:10,379
have been that are organized that we've

575
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:11,939
been reaching out to

576
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:14,840
um that that are identifiable and have

577
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:14,840
also reached out to us

578
00:21:17,099 --> 00:21:22,918
won't affect the OMP program but I just

579
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:26,038
want to clarify uh specifically on House

580
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:27,840
Bill 2040 that bans medical marijuana

581
00:21:26,038 --> 00:21:29,940
businesses within one mile radius of

582
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:32,879
schools that will have no effect on the

583
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:34,200
home MP program for say existing growth

584
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,179
sites what I would tell you is I don't

585
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:38,819
know anything about

586
00:21:36,179 --> 00:21:41,460
that particular piece of legislation the

587
00:21:38,819 --> 00:21:43,439
commission is really focused on we don't

588
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:44,880
have any control over the OMMP the only

589
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,919
people that could affect that is the

590
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,720
Oregon legislature so you're right to

591
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:50,280
look at those bills but that doesn't do

592
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:53,400
it we don't have any control over those

593
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:56,538
bills my question is on the in the

594
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,538
impaired driving

595
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:08,158
are trying to produce products that have

596
00:22:03,659 --> 00:22:11,159
zero THC in them and and that is

597
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:13,919
essentially for those who are possibly

598
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:18,200
drivers and those who are possibly

599
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:22,140
children and how how does that affect

600
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:24,720
those folks that there is no THC which I

601
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:27,120
believe that's the active ingredient in

602
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:29,819
there so if there are only CBDs and

603
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:32,158
stuff that helps seizures on the Glam

604
00:22:29,819 --> 00:22:34,439
all epileptic so we would like to be

605
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:37,320
able to control those things and not get

606
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:39,600
high and so are you folks setting up

607
00:22:37,319 --> 00:22:41,819
some form of

608
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:43,740
you know clarification on that because

609
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:46,259
I'm sure there's a lot of energy well

610
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:47,640
most of that is under the most of those

611
00:22:46,259 --> 00:22:49,558
are under the Oregon medical marijuana

612
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:51,659
program recreational marijuana cannot

613
00:22:49,558 --> 00:22:55,980
have cannot be given to children at all

614
00:22:51,659 --> 00:22:57,600
it's those over the age of 21. so most

615
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:59,339
of that will be housed in the in the

616
00:22:57,599 --> 00:23:02,158
medical marijuana program which again we

617
00:22:59,339 --> 00:23:04,859
have no regulatory oversight or ability

618
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:06,360
to to control that how many people are

619
00:23:04,859 --> 00:23:08,219
going to be on that rules advisory

620
00:23:06,359 --> 00:23:09,599
committee and if that's determined like

621
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:11,279
legislatively or if that's something

622
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:13,619
that you guys have within your power to

623
00:23:11,279 --> 00:23:18,079
determine so the rules advisory

624
00:23:13,619 --> 00:23:21,859
committee is at the commission level

625
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:24,119
it'll be director appointed

626
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:27,298
at least a plan at this point in time

627
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:28,918
and we had the discussion today we're

628
00:23:27,298 --> 00:23:31,440
waiting to hear back from staff tomorrow

629
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:33,720
morning uh the the pitch today was

630
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:36,240
having a third about 13 members on that

631
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:38,400
committee but it's uh it's a it's

632
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,359
through the OLCC so that's and then

633
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,220
there's a plan to do a bunch of

634
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:43,859
subcommittees underneath that especially

635
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:44,900
for to get some really specific

636
00:23:43,859 --> 00:23:48,000
knowledge

637
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:50,580
should there be restrictions on where

638
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,798
marijuana businesses can operate yes

639
00:23:50,579 --> 00:23:56,000
there should be restrictions on where

640
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:59,400
they can operate red no I think okay

641
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,980
largely green but it's mixed they're

642
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:05,400
Reds and a few yellow scattered within

643
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:08,720
there wow he's holding his a friend no

644
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:11,580
and what we've heard from some of these

645
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:14,038
jurisdictions is that you know we don't

646
00:24:11,579 --> 00:24:16,199
control jurisdictions you know and some

647
00:24:14,038 --> 00:24:18,720
of the jurisdictions have asked the

648
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:21,240
legislature to take a look at allowing

649
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:23,339
them to maintain home rule because each

650
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:26,038
of us live someplace else

651
00:24:23,339 --> 00:24:27,720
and some of the concern is is that from

652
00:24:26,038 --> 00:24:30,240
the state level we'll start telling the

653
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:31,980
cities and the counties how to run their

654
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:34,140
communities and so that's where that

655
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:36,538
question kind of came from

656
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:38,340
should retail outlets be allowed to

657
00:24:36,538 --> 00:24:41,940
co-locate with medical marijuana

658
00:24:38,339 --> 00:24:44,759
dispensaries yes or no

659
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:47,340
should they be allowed to co-locate with

660
00:24:44,759 --> 00:24:51,359
medical marijuana dispensaries very

661
00:24:47,339 --> 00:24:53,519
predominantly green but let's this

662
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:56,219
gentleman wants to speak I understand

663
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:58,139
the co-mingling of both medical and

664
00:24:56,220 --> 00:25:00,779
recreational but

665
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:02,940
I feel the problem is medical got such a

666
00:25:00,779 --> 00:25:05,339
historical recreational for people that

667
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:08,460
are already owning medical dispensaries

668
00:25:05,339 --> 00:25:10,139
they have an unfair advantage

669
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:11,159
so for the people on the recreational

670
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:13,200
side

671
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:16,080
you have to adhere by a different set of

672
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,700
rules and finding those limited spaces

673
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:19,798
that are still available is becoming

674
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:21,900
harder and harder

675
00:25:19,798 --> 00:25:24,119
the same regulation a thousand people in

676
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:26,159
the school another dispensary

677
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:27,439
you're not giving the same platform she

678
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:29,700
said

679
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:31,679
one of the main concerns was already

680
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:33,720
brought up which is regulation Law

681
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:35,400
Enforcement wants one system to audit

682
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:36,659
we've heard them say that over and over

683
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:38,580
so that's something that you're going to

684
00:25:36,659 --> 00:25:41,159
have to consider from their perspective

685
00:25:38,579 --> 00:25:43,199
OLCC probably they're not going to tell

686
00:25:41,159 --> 00:25:45,860
you right now but they probably feel the

687
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:49,140
same way they want one system to audit

688
00:25:45,859 --> 00:25:50,519
and beyond that I think that if you're

689
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:52,259
going to have a thousand foot from each

690
00:25:50,519 --> 00:25:54,000
other buffers where are you going to put

691
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:57,839
a recreational store in Portland

692
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:01,919
nowhere there's 117 dispensaries in

693
00:25:57,839 --> 00:26:04,500
Portland out of 225 in the State uh

694
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:06,960
uh okay at least 110 of them are

695
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:10,319
licensed okay yeah so should there be

696
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:12,600
should there be a server type of permit

697
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:16,859
in marijuana just like there is an

698
00:26:12,599 --> 00:26:18,418
alcohol green Yes red no yellow Maybe

699
00:26:16,859 --> 00:26:21,119
okay okay

700
00:26:18,419 --> 00:26:23,278
so Tom you've got somebody

701
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:26,699
I'm opposed to having them have a

702
00:26:23,278 --> 00:26:30,720
permitting process okay another fee to

703
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:32,460
before it starts first of all the real

704
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,740
issue that we're looking at is surfing

705
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:35,700
underage

706
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:37,798
underage people I think that's really

707
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:40,620
the only concern in terms of the

708
00:26:37,798 --> 00:26:42,119
training at this point and that's the

709
00:26:40,619 --> 00:26:44,519
only thing we have research to back up

710
00:26:42,119 --> 00:26:45,839
or anything to go on forward with and I

711
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:48,440
already heard the commission talk about

712
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:51,740
implementing a potential card check

713
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:54,298
measure against people who are found

714
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:55,940
bioaving and serving underage people so

715
00:26:54,298 --> 00:26:58,440
there's already a policy where they can

716
00:26:55,940 --> 00:27:00,000
hand down some consequences in terms of

717
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:02,519
people who are breaking the law and

718
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:05,038
serving minors and beyond that there's

719
00:27:02,519 --> 00:27:07,200
really not any sort of standard set or

720
00:27:05,038 --> 00:27:09,058
any sort of information to create this

721
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,400
test that bud tenders are supposed to

722
00:27:09,058 --> 00:27:13,440
pass and it just really doesn't serve

723
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:15,000
any greater purpose I guess

724
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:17,220
I think there are a number of concerns

725
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,079
about getting marijuana served to me as

726
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:20,880
a consumer Beyond just whether or not my

727
00:27:19,079 --> 00:27:22,918
gray hair says that I'm too old or too

728
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,600
young for it I want to know that the

729
00:27:22,919 --> 00:27:26,460
person that's grabbing that butt has

730
00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:27,839
washed their hands are they wearing a

731
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:30,360
glove do they know the difference

732
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:32,939
between indica and sativa they have any

733
00:27:30,359 --> 00:27:34,979
idea what concentrates are how long to

734
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:36,778
wait for a cookie to take to kick in

735
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:37,860
there are a lot of concerns and I want

736
00:27:36,778 --> 00:27:40,679
to make sure that the people that are

737
00:27:37,859 --> 00:27:42,538
serving the especially the new cannabis

738
00:27:40,679 --> 00:27:44,278
consumers that will be coming into and

739
00:27:42,538 --> 00:27:45,480
the tourists we don't want to have bad

740
00:27:44,278 --> 00:27:48,058
headlines like they had in Colorado

741
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:51,200
let's make sure that our servers are

742
00:27:48,058 --> 00:27:51,200
licensed and trained

743
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:58,579
please don't confuse being served in a

744
00:27:54,720 --> 00:28:01,919
bar with buying recreational weed

745
00:27:58,579 --> 00:28:04,019
all right should there be limits on the

746
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:06,059
size of commercial marijuana grow

747
00:28:04,019 --> 00:28:08,519
operations and that's number of plants

748
00:28:06,058 --> 00:28:10,798
or canopy yet to be determined but

749
00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:13,379
should there be some sort of limits on

750
00:28:10,798 --> 00:28:17,759
the size of the growing operation

751
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:19,980
mostly red mixed but mostly red I would

752
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:22,640
say more red than green not similar to

753
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:22,640
farming

754
00:28:23,579 --> 00:28:28,579
born acre Valley

755
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:28,580
the small farmers they're not

756
00:28:29,038 --> 00:28:32,339
big in the state there's a lot of

757
00:28:30,599 --> 00:28:34,319
farmers that are small and it shouldn't

758
00:28:32,339 --> 00:28:37,259
be limited to you know you can only grow

759
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:39,538
five corn flasks or tomatoes it should

760
00:28:37,259 --> 00:28:41,579
just be based on the regulations in

761
00:28:39,538 --> 00:28:43,319
place and the rules you know as long as

762
00:28:41,579 --> 00:28:45,740
you're meeting that you can

763
00:28:43,319 --> 00:28:48,778
you can do what you want

764
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:51,179
there's we have no idea how many users

765
00:28:48,778 --> 00:28:52,380
of recreational marijuana are going to

766
00:28:51,179 --> 00:28:55,320
be

767
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:58,380
at this point we have no idea it's too

768
00:28:55,319 --> 00:29:00,538
early to put that into place and how

769
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:02,159
large a grow operation needs to be the

770
00:29:00,538 --> 00:29:04,500
grow operation will serve the clients

771
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:06,419
that they sell to and there's no way for

772
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:08,640
us to know exactly

773
00:29:06,419 --> 00:29:09,960
what that will look like

774
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,640
and you know if we put a restriction on

775
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:13,380
it now that will limit the size of

776
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:15,720
businesses it'll limit the number of

777
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:17,460
people that they can serve and so on

778
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:21,798
would there be different requirements

779
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:25,860
for indoor and outdoor grow operations

780
00:29:21,798 --> 00:29:27,960
should there be different requirements

781
00:29:25,859 --> 00:29:30,298
oh really mixed

782
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:31,860
and a lot of yellows

783
00:29:30,298 --> 00:29:34,379
it's important that marijuana growers

784
00:29:31,859 --> 00:29:37,759
have a security system

785
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:41,760
should they have a security system

786
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:43,679
okay a lot of greens mostly greens

787
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:45,898
so that's one of the things when we ask

788
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:47,278
the first question that's one of the

789
00:29:45,898 --> 00:29:49,739
things a lot of the audience would talk

790
00:29:47,278 --> 00:29:51,839
about is the different requirements for

791
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:53,099
security with an indoor versus an

792
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:54,658
outdoor

793
00:29:53,099 --> 00:29:56,398
you have a couple of follow-up questions

794
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:57,840
yeah so so one of the big questions

795
00:29:56,398 --> 00:29:59,879
we've had one of the questions that's

796
00:29:57,839 --> 00:30:01,740
going to be on our mind is we prepare to

797
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:03,840
put rules into place how many people

798
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:05,399
think that video surveillance systems

799
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:07,019
should be required on any marijuana

800
00:30:05,398 --> 00:30:11,819
growth

801
00:30:07,019 --> 00:30:11,819
video surveillance huh

802
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:19,380
well then you should have a recorded

803
00:30:17,278 --> 00:30:21,480
video surveillance system

804
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:23,520
and there's a lot of Reds there are a

805
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:25,440
lot it's really mixed which is the issue

806
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:29,339
of uh testing

807
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:31,200
so should the OLCC require testing of

808
00:30:29,339 --> 00:30:34,019
recreational marijuana for things such

809
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:36,259
as potency pesticides and molds should

810
00:30:34,019 --> 00:30:38,819
there be a requirement for testing okay

811
00:30:36,259 --> 00:30:40,919
that's pretty so that's pretty

812
00:30:38,819 --> 00:30:44,099
overwhelmingly green people would be in

813
00:30:40,919 --> 00:30:45,899
favor of requiring that the medical

814
00:30:44,099 --> 00:30:49,379
marijuana program

815
00:30:45,898 --> 00:30:53,298
adopt the same testing standard as the

816
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:53,299
recreational program okay that too

817
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,679
about so we appreciate your input on

818
00:30:55,558 --> 00:30:57,678
that

819
00:30:58,619 --> 00:31:03,599
yeah well standardized fantastic the

820
00:31:01,619 --> 00:31:06,479
fellow up here the question he asked is

821
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:08,158
is the will the labs be standardized and

822
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:10,259
that's a lot of what we've heard is that

823
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:11,640
you're getting those of you are who are

824
00:31:10,259 --> 00:31:13,440
having your product tested are getting

825
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:14,940
really different results depending on

826
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,620
the labs and I'm seeing heads knots

827
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:18,960
should edible recreational marijuana

828
00:31:16,619 --> 00:31:21,898
products be available

829
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:24,058
yes okay that's what I thought so should

830
00:31:21,898 --> 00:31:26,699
edible recreational marijuana packages

831
00:31:24,058 --> 00:31:28,798
contain information on dosage and

832
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:33,360
serving sizes

833
00:31:28,798 --> 00:31:36,058
yes okay simple okay so should should we

834
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:39,599
prohibit recreational marijuana products

835
00:31:36,058 --> 00:31:42,720
that may be appealing to children

836
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:45,178
this is where yeah we get more mixed on

837
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:47,700
this one should there be standards

838
00:31:45,179 --> 00:31:49,679
for what's required on labels like there

839
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:51,000
is on food you know and you know what

840
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:53,159
you're getting

841
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,200
so should there be standards set for

842
00:31:53,159 --> 00:31:56,940
what's required on the labels and that's

843
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,080
overwhelmingly green thanks guys for

844
00:31:56,940 --> 00:32:00,600
having this meeting

845
00:31:58,079 --> 00:32:02,519
um I I know that the statute in measure

846
00:32:00,599 --> 00:32:06,000
91 says there's not going to be the

847
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:08,220
public use cafes uh scenarios

848
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,720
um my question is specifically is there

849
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:13,019
going to be any kind of involvement for

850
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:14,640
a private club style scenario so the RCC

851
00:32:13,019 --> 00:32:16,139
we don't believe currently has the

852
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:18,600
licensing ability or regulatory

853
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:20,580
authority to have a license for a club

854
00:32:18,599 --> 00:32:21,959
oriented business so that would be

855
00:32:20,579 --> 00:32:24,720
something the Oregon legislature would

856
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:25,740
have to tackle so if you're interested

857
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,480
in that you'd have to talk to the

858
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:28,740
legislature my name is Russ Bellville

859
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:30,058
I'm the executive director of Portland

860
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:32,099
normal and I want to thank you for

861
00:32:30,058 --> 00:32:33,418
having these listening sessions uh I

862
00:32:32,099 --> 00:32:36,959
would encourage you as a Liquor Control

863
00:32:33,419 --> 00:32:39,059
Commission in the gray areas where it

864
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:41,579
isn't specifically dictated by measure

865
00:32:39,058 --> 00:32:44,278
91 that an operating principal should be

866
00:32:41,579 --> 00:32:46,019
what do we do with alcohol and so when

867
00:32:44,278 --> 00:32:47,519
you have questions like how big or how

868
00:32:46,019 --> 00:32:49,379
much should people be able to grow in a

869
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:51,839
commercial setting how much can they

870
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:54,360
brew at Widmer how much can they brew at

871
00:32:51,839 --> 00:32:56,278
McMenamins is there a limit on them if

872
00:32:54,359 --> 00:32:58,199
there is apply it to us

873
00:32:56,278 --> 00:32:59,819
when we're talking about serving we're

874
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:01,259
talking about retail licensing we're

875
00:32:59,819 --> 00:33:02,759
talking about packaging I don't think

876
00:33:01,259 --> 00:33:04,798
these questions are too hard to answer

877
00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:06,720
we've already answered them with the

878
00:33:04,798 --> 00:33:09,058
most deadly dangerous drug there is

879
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:11,360
alcohol apply that reasoning to

880
00:33:09,058 --> 00:33:11,359
marijuana

881
00:33:11,398 --> 00:33:15,959
hi my name is Jefferson uh kind of a

882
00:33:14,038 --> 00:33:17,700
response to that I think there needs to

883
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:20,519
be a strong Focus

884
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:23,340
on limits on growing precisely because

885
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:25,140
as someone mentioned there's no limits

886
00:33:23,339 --> 00:33:28,459
on current plans but this isn't a corn

887
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:32,399
plant this is a specific Niche product

888
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:34,620
and Oregon's distilling in Brewing

889
00:33:32,398 --> 00:33:38,038
Industries have become

890
00:33:34,619 --> 00:33:40,619
the high points of the national scene

891
00:33:38,038 --> 00:33:42,960
that they are by letting Niche markets

892
00:33:40,619 --> 00:33:44,939
grow and if this is turned into

893
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:48,298
something where a Thousand Acre Farms

894
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:50,700
can produce tons than the local Growers

895
00:33:48,298 --> 00:33:53,339
isn't going to have a place or

896
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:55,679
to compete so will there be a

897
00:33:53,339 --> 00:33:56,819
a focus and emphasis on letting small

898
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:59,038
businesses

899
00:33:56,819 --> 00:34:00,298
become part of the scene I wanted to

900
00:33:59,038 --> 00:34:02,099
provide my perspective on just three

901
00:34:00,298 --> 00:34:04,500
quick issues um and you don't need to

902
00:34:02,099 --> 00:34:05,699
respond I just wanted to say so one is

903
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:07,798
is that everything that you guys are

904
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:09,480
doing please do it with the mind of

905
00:34:07,798 --> 00:34:11,159
encouraging this industry and not

906
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:12,358
restricting or reducing it because we're

907
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:15,059
at a stage right now where we really

908
00:34:12,358 --> 00:34:16,378
want to grow this industry so um you

909
00:34:15,059 --> 00:34:18,179
know with the exception of necessary

910
00:34:16,378 --> 00:34:20,878
restrictions we want to avoid any

911
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:22,378
unnecessary hindrances on the industry

912
00:34:20,878 --> 00:34:23,940
the second thing is when it comes to

913
00:34:22,378 --> 00:34:26,460
kids I think we shouldn't be irrational

914
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:27,898
or overblow the issue kids have access

915
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:30,300
to marijuana today they've had access

916
00:34:27,898 --> 00:34:32,460
for marijuana you know 50 years ago I

917
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:33,720
don't think that putting um bright

918
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:35,519
colors on the label are going to make

919
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:36,719
more kids smoke marijuana I don't think

920
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:37,679
we need to worry about that especially

921
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:40,559
when we're looking at them being

922
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:42,898
available in adult-only stores so um

923
00:34:40,559 --> 00:34:44,279
don't get blown away by this idea of

924
00:34:42,898 --> 00:34:46,378
protecting our children we've already

925
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:48,359
established rules and limits that take

926
00:34:46,378 --> 00:34:51,418
that into account and then the final

927
00:34:48,358 --> 00:34:53,039
thing is um with regards to the

928
00:34:51,418 --> 00:34:55,199
limitations on the plants canopies

929
00:34:53,039 --> 00:34:56,940
acreage whatever I I think that we need

930
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:58,259
to take into account that we want to

931
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:59,940
encourage economies of scale cost

932
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:01,619
savings energy efficiencies and things

933
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:04,139
like this and not put unnecessary risk

934
00:35:01,619 --> 00:35:06,480
restrictions that require us to do

935
00:35:04,139 --> 00:35:08,039
things that require excessive energy or

936
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:10,338
that require excessive cost that would

937
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:13,079
be a burden on the industry

938
00:35:10,338 --> 00:35:15,480
my name is Jackson McCormick I'm a

939
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:17,519
dispensary owner and I wanted to talk

940
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:19,380
about co-location and a couple ways to

941
00:35:17,519 --> 00:35:22,199
address that I think the testing

942
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:24,119
standard is a way to address that and I

943
00:35:22,199 --> 00:35:26,098
think the Oregon Health Authority would

944
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:28,500
be pressured heavily by myself and other

945
00:35:26,099 --> 00:35:30,300
dispensary owners to have Labs adopted

946
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:31,980
adopt a standard because as you said

947
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:34,140
we've all experienced here the issue

948
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:36,358
with testing drastically differently

949
00:35:34,139 --> 00:35:38,400
between facilities I think that would

950
00:35:36,358 --> 00:35:40,139
solve the biggest issue of co-location

951
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:43,619
where the marijuana program already

952
00:35:40,139 --> 00:35:46,139
requires customer specific historical

953
00:35:43,619 --> 00:35:48,358
purchase information to be kept on site

954
00:35:46,139 --> 00:35:49,679
that's more regulation than we're going

955
00:35:48,358 --> 00:35:52,019
to be requiring in the recreational

956
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:54,779
Market I also don't think the seed to

957
00:35:52,019 --> 00:35:56,159
sale aspect is really that influential I

958
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:58,320
don't think people are rushing to be

959
00:35:56,159 --> 00:35:59,699
regulated and paid taxes and then are

960
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:02,640
going to sell their product in the black

961
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:04,379
market or vice versa I think that slows

962
00:36:02,639 --> 00:36:06,118
down the process of the recreational

963
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:08,099
Market hammering down the black market

964
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:10,320
and eliminating it completely because if

965
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:12,599
we create a safe access and illegal

966
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:14,280
access that pays good taxes people are

967
00:36:12,599 --> 00:36:16,200
going to be interested in all the

968
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:17,700
estimates so far indicate that the

969
00:36:16,199 --> 00:36:22,439
purchase price in Oregon is going to be

970
00:36:17,699 --> 00:36:24,480
ridiculously low so I just really LC the

971
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:26,720
intense focus on the seed to sale aspect

972
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,719
of the

973
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:32,700
um I have comment about the limiting of

974
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:34,619
the acreage or whatever for Growers I

975
00:36:32,699 --> 00:36:36,598
feel it should be limited because you're

976
00:36:34,619 --> 00:36:39,660
going to have a millionaire farmer out

977
00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:40,980
in eastern Oregon with 6 000 acres and

978
00:36:39,659 --> 00:36:44,279
then you're going to have a small person

979
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:47,039
down in Eugene with only two acres it

980
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:48,660
really will help to limit it because the

981
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:51,239
small businesses will then have an

982
00:36:48,659 --> 00:36:54,838
opportunity to thrive my other question

983
00:36:51,239 --> 00:36:56,159
is there's an open container law for

984
00:36:54,838 --> 00:36:59,639
driving

985
00:36:56,159 --> 00:37:03,779
will there be an open pipeline or

986
00:36:59,639 --> 00:37:06,420
whatever you know so so currently there

987
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:08,339
is no open container law like there is

988
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:09,960
in alcohol I know there's a strong

989
00:37:08,338 --> 00:37:12,838
interest in the commission addressed

990
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:14,940
that today as one of the items that uh

991
00:37:12,838 --> 00:37:15,900
that the legislature needs to take a

992
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:18,240
look at so that we can have

993
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:21,358
clarification personal use is a kind of

994
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:24,838
a gray area you know there's right no

995
00:37:21,358 --> 00:37:26,480
we're well aware it's my personal space

996
00:37:24,838 --> 00:37:29,639
okay

997
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:32,159
I have an assessment and a question an

998
00:37:29,639 --> 00:37:34,078
assessment is that you know this

999
00:37:32,159 --> 00:37:36,719
industry is in you know it's real

1000
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:39,480
infancy right now and

1001
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:41,159
putting too many an onerous regulations

1002
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:43,139
on the people who are going to be

1003
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:45,480
building this industry and its Embassy I

1004
00:37:43,139 --> 00:37:48,420
think is a general guideline maybe it's

1005
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:51,119
not the greatest idea in the world as a

1006
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:54,180
question I am curious what the review

1007
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:56,640
process is going to be over time

1008
00:37:54,179 --> 00:37:58,679
um because you know this is the industry

1009
00:37:56,639 --> 00:38:01,858
will be evolving so is there going to be

1010
00:37:58,679 --> 00:38:04,739
a review process say to review the

1011
00:38:01,858 --> 00:38:06,358
regulations and you know that big

1012
00:38:04,739 --> 00:38:08,399
changes accordingly you know change

1013
00:38:06,358 --> 00:38:11,039
course okay I would tell you that the

1014
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:13,800
OLCC tries to regularly look at its

1015
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:15,179
rules on a regular basis we have

1016
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:17,460
hearings we have all kinds of things

1017
00:38:15,179 --> 00:38:18,838
related to changing alcohol rules to

1018
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:21,300
meet the market we had to deal with

1019
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:23,039
issues related to Growlers and we had to

1020
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:24,480
deal with all those kinds of issues and

1021
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:26,400
we were Market innovators that were

1022
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:27,539
pushing the rest of the country so you

1023
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,039
have the staff and a group of

1024
00:38:27,539 --> 00:38:31,679
Commissioners who are committed to

1025
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:33,239
constantly re-looking at those things so

1026
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:35,159
it's not just something we put on the

1027
00:38:33,239 --> 00:38:38,219
shelf and then keep going

1028
00:38:35,159 --> 00:38:40,679
I believe the creativity of both the

1029
00:38:38,219 --> 00:38:43,439
Edibles as products and the graphics

1030
00:38:40,679 --> 00:38:46,919
used to advertise them should not be

1031
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:49,500
limited by if it appeals to Children if

1032
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:52,980
you as a consumer purchase an edible

1033
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:54,480
product you need to be responsible for

1034
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:56,880
keeping it out of the hands of the

1035
00:38:54,480 --> 00:39:00,300
children just like alcohol

1036
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:03,079
I understand the importance of not over

1037
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:05,820
taxing based on

1038
00:39:03,079 --> 00:39:10,260
what's going on in Washington

1039
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:14,700
but what I my question is is why is it

1040
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:16,740
um just the grower it seems like burning

1041
00:39:14,699 --> 00:39:18,960
but what I would tell you is that's what

1042
00:39:16,739 --> 00:39:20,279
oregonians voted on and that's what the

1043
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:22,440
proponents of the measure put forward

1044
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:25,019
and we didn't have anything to do with

1045
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:26,639
that at OLCC I'm not sure why they did

1046
00:39:25,019 --> 00:39:29,960
it that way they've never provided a

1047
00:39:26,639 --> 00:39:29,960
great explanation for me from that

1048
00:39:32,699 --> 00:39:36,118
marketing side and I know one question

1049
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:37,500
we've come up with quite a bit is uh

1050
00:39:36,119 --> 00:39:39,358
basically advertising kind of over the

1051
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:41,280
border and I guess I would kind of

1052
00:39:39,358 --> 00:39:44,159
encourage and kind of ask you all if the

1053
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:46,560
OLCC plants are really communicate that

1054
00:39:44,159 --> 00:39:48,719
the Washington about how those laws will

1055
00:39:46,559 --> 00:39:50,460
interact as far as uh basically business

1056
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:53,299
on the board advertising back and forth

1057
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:56,039
so just so you understand

1058
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:58,380
the the call memorandum specifically

1059
00:39:56,039 --> 00:40:00,179
tells us not to be involved in

1060
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:02,460
interstate commerce between the two

1061
00:40:00,179 --> 00:40:05,098
states so you are probably not going to

1062
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:07,079
see this commission trying to engage in

1063
00:40:05,099 --> 00:40:09,300
conversations with Washington about how

1064
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:12,720
that advertising works uh the first

1065
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:14,940
issue the first thing is about uh you

1066
00:40:12,719 --> 00:40:17,459
know size grows limitations residency

1067
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:19,440
restrictions I think all of us are just

1068
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:21,659
looking for a way to protect Oregon from

1069
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:23,820
Walmart and Kmart and everything else

1070
00:40:21,659 --> 00:40:25,379
and give the opportunities to the small

1071
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:27,660
business so I appreciate that you guys

1072
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:29,338
are taking that issue seriously the last

1073
00:40:27,659 --> 00:40:31,980
thing then is uh with regards to the

1074
00:40:29,338 --> 00:40:33,299
testing would that fall under cost of

1075
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:34,460
goods sold and would that be a tax

1076
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:36,200
deductible

1077
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:38,880
item

1078
00:40:36,199 --> 00:40:40,379
that that would be but as you guys are

1079
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:42,900
all aware there's really specific

1080
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:44,460
federal tax rules related to this we

1081
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:46,680
there were some deduction things that we

1082
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:49,559
had to deal with that OLCC is looking at

1083
00:40:46,679 --> 00:40:51,539
working with Department of Revenue and I

1084
00:40:49,559 --> 00:40:52,920
agree that you shouldn't be heavy-handed

1085
00:40:51,539 --> 00:40:56,159
in terms of sea to seal tracking but

1086
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:58,200
clearly because of the coal memo and you

1087
00:40:56,159 --> 00:41:00,480
know you don't want a product diverted

1088
00:40:58,199 --> 00:41:02,159
into a black market and you want to be

1089
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:03,838
able to track it for taxation clearly

1090
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:06,899
you have to have strong robust seed to

1091
00:41:03,838 --> 00:41:08,519
sale tracking system but I would I would

1092
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:11,160
offer a cautionary till

1093
00:41:08,519 --> 00:41:14,159
Washington that really approaches from

1094
00:41:11,159 --> 00:41:16,559
technology perspective and not a policy

1095
00:41:14,159 --> 00:41:18,799
perspective so that when you adopt um

1096
00:41:16,559 --> 00:41:22,380
seed to sale software

1097
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:26,220
regulations or specifications for a

1098
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:28,320
database that allows free open access to

1099
00:41:26,219 --> 00:41:30,000
other software competitors because

1100
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:33,119
that's really going to create what

1101
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:36,119
Marvin referred to as as the Silicon

1102
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:38,400
Valley of of where and Oregon has a

1103
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:40,980
unique opportunity to really create a

1104
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:44,599
connoisseur culture for marijuana and

1105
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:47,780
ADD to the technology perspective

1106
00:41:44,599 --> 00:41:50,760
but my question is mostly about Growers

1107
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:52,859
later on when we get moving into this

1108
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:55,440
how are we going to do breeding and Seed

1109
00:41:52,858 --> 00:41:57,659
sales even within the state and before

1110
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:59,039
that how are Growers going to obtain the

1111
00:41:57,659 --> 00:42:01,618
seeds

1112
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:04,380
so the OLCC is asking the same question

1113
00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:06,358
as part of the three plus hour policy

1114
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:07,980
discussion we had this morning we have

1115
00:42:06,358 --> 00:42:09,659
asked the legislature to clarify that

1116
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:11,519
because it's not clear from a policy

1117
00:42:09,659 --> 00:42:12,739
position even what the OLCC should do

1118
00:42:11,519 --> 00:42:15,300
related to that

1119
00:42:12,739 --> 00:42:17,039
you know are we going to assume

1120
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:19,220
Immaculate Conception and that's one

1121
00:42:17,039 --> 00:42:21,300
yeah

1122
00:42:19,219 --> 00:42:22,858
that is what a lot of other states have

1123
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:24,420
done but we we have asked the

1124
00:42:22,858 --> 00:42:26,460
legislature to clarify that from a

1125
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:29,220
policy perspective because we don't want

1126
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:31,260
to send our staff out there into this

1127
00:42:29,219 --> 00:42:32,759
unknown so we think it's fair to

1128
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:34,200
everybody to at least clarify what we're

1129
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:36,480
going to do

1130
00:42:34,199 --> 00:42:38,519
hi my name is Kelly and I'm a co-ower

1131
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:41,639
owner of a lab and also work to help

1132
00:42:38,519 --> 00:42:43,500
running a dispensary since 2010. I just

1133
00:42:41,639 --> 00:42:44,940
come to give input from a lot of people

1134
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:46,800
I've been talking to and the Oregon

1135
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:49,139
residency thing seems to be a big thing

1136
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:51,000
that's important to people here

1137
00:42:49,139 --> 00:42:53,699
um also with the Medicals and concerning

1138
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,960
children a lot of us feel like there's

1139
00:42:53,699 --> 00:42:57,480
already something in place for that

1140
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:59,220
concern which is Criminal consequences

1141
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:00,960
and I know a lot of people in this

1142
00:42:59,219 --> 00:43:02,818
industry have kind of Taken offense that

1143
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:05,179
we get the wrap that we are not

1144
00:43:02,818 --> 00:43:07,920
responsible adults around children

1145
00:43:05,179 --> 00:43:09,719
also when it comes to lab testing I just

1146
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:11,639
ask that hopefully you get as much input

1147
00:43:09,719 --> 00:43:13,019
from as many Labs as you can instead of

1148
00:43:11,639 --> 00:43:14,578
just one or two

1149
00:43:13,019 --> 00:43:16,800
and then with that when you're

1150
00:43:14,579 --> 00:43:18,539
implementing the rules just keep in mind

1151
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:20,579
just as much input from the public

1152
00:43:18,539 --> 00:43:22,440
concerns that is as there is for the

1153
00:43:20,579 --> 00:43:23,640
industry since we have the most

1154
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:25,500
experience of knowing what's efficient

1155
00:43:23,639 --> 00:43:28,078
how this can work best

1156
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:30,179
what kind of the issues relating to

1157
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:33,000
banking are in Oregon because in

1158
00:43:30,179 --> 00:43:34,559
Washington the horror stories are just

1159
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,599
crazy with what people have to go

1160
00:43:34,559 --> 00:43:37,619
through just to be able to put their

1161
00:43:36,599 --> 00:43:39,180
money that they made off of this

1162
00:43:37,619 --> 00:43:41,660
industry in the bank and so I was

1163
00:43:39,179 --> 00:43:43,858
wondering uh

1164
00:43:41,659 --> 00:43:45,598
the banking issues predominantly a

1165
00:43:43,858 --> 00:43:47,460
federal issue we just had the Arc of

1166
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:49,980
Treasury as well as Department of

1167
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:51,780
Revenue as well as mbank which is a bank

1168
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:54,719
that is accepting

1169
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:57,960
um which is accepting the positives

1170
00:43:54,719 --> 00:43:59,639
um we are in discussions mbake has had

1171
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:01,199
some limited discussion with us related

1172
00:43:59,639 --> 00:44:03,000
to what they're going to require of

1173
00:44:01,199 --> 00:44:05,519
their customers we certainly realize

1174
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:08,338
it's an issue we don't have the capacity

1175
00:44:05,519 --> 00:44:09,780
to LCC to once a month have Brinks

1176
00:44:08,338 --> 00:44:12,838
trucks roll up to the front door with

1177
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:15,660
cash to pay your taxes so we have the

1178
00:44:12,838 --> 00:44:17,039
same concern at llcc as well so we are

1179
00:44:15,659 --> 00:44:19,019
trying to work on that but that is

1180
00:44:17,039 --> 00:44:20,940
predominantly a federal issue that we

1181
00:44:19,019 --> 00:44:23,759
can't control first of all I just want

1182
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:25,800
to speak out in support of the canopy

1183
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:29,280
limits because I believe that the one of

1184
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:31,380
the main key purposes of this law is to

1185
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:34,680
bring marijuana production into a

1186
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:37,858
tightly well-regulated system and I

1187
00:44:34,679 --> 00:44:39,719
believe a key component of that is

1188
00:44:37,858 --> 00:44:41,759
co-opting the people that are currently

1189
00:44:39,719 --> 00:44:43,799
growing on the black market and so forth

1190
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:46,260
and I can tell you that if it's if it's

1191
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:48,480
not designed in such a way to co-opt as

1192
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:50,280
many of those as possible they're going

1193
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:52,980
to just keep on growing because they're

1194
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:55,680
you know they're they've been doing this

1195
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:58,079
for a very long time and so uh if

1196
00:44:55,679 --> 00:45:00,480
they're if it's not designed for that

1197
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:02,220
purpose it's gonna you know it's going

1198
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:04,440
to cause a problem and having smaller

1199
00:45:02,219 --> 00:45:06,299
limits will allow the little guy to have

1200
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:08,700
a chance to be able to take part in this

1201
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:10,680
industry in an economic way

1202
00:45:08,699 --> 00:45:12,779
and uh I would say that you know in

1203
00:45:10,679 --> 00:45:14,699
Washington they had 21 000 square foot

1204
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:16,680
limits they had three tiers I can tell

1205
00:45:14,699 --> 00:45:18,299
you the 21 000 square feet of weed a

1206
00:45:16,679 --> 00:45:21,419
thousand to two thousand pounds of weed

1207
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:23,280
is a lot of weed okay so you know

1208
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:24,960
they're that it's going to be a good

1209
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:26,880
size for area a thousand or two thousand

1210
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:29,579
square feet of canopy is quite it's it's

1211
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:31,440
a lot of weeds uh the second point is I

1212
00:45:29,579 --> 00:45:33,060
am a Clark County resident and I've

1213
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:34,440
heard I know that this is a main issue

1214
00:45:33,059 --> 00:45:37,980
so I don't want to really push anybody's

1215
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:40,200
buttons on this but the as a Clark

1216
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:42,420
County resident I am a member of this

1217
00:45:40,199 --> 00:45:45,000
metro area and Clark County residents we

1218
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:47,099
pay over 150 million dollars a year in

1219
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:49,079
income tax revenue for the state of

1220
00:45:47,099 --> 00:45:51,300
Oregon and we're the eighth largest

1221
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:53,940
county in Oregon State as far as tax

1222
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:55,920
revenue and I would just I would just

1223
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:58,920
really like to have an opportunity to

1224
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:00,900
take part in the economic uh life of

1225
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:02,880
this of this community uh so I would

1226
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:04,740
hope any uh I know there isn't any

1227
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:06,180
actual residency requirements in the

1228
00:46:04,739 --> 00:46:07,799
building that'll be up to you guys to

1229
00:46:06,179 --> 00:46:10,500
decide that but I would hope that maybe

1230
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:12,780
I said it's up to the logic okay

1231
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:14,400
um I would just hope that whatever is

1232
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:16,980
decided that uh taking into

1233
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:19,680
consideration the economic participation

1234
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:21,300
of of adjacent counties I would say

1235
00:46:19,679 --> 00:46:22,679
would I would hope that you would keep

1236
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:25,740
that under consideration

1237
00:46:22,679 --> 00:46:27,480
concerns I have just to kind of touch on

1238
00:46:25,739 --> 00:46:28,679
the point that the gentleman just made

1239
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:31,619
was

1240
00:46:28,679 --> 00:46:33,838
if we're creating a seed to sales system

1241
00:46:31,619 --> 00:46:37,079
isn't that kind of contradictory to not

1242
00:46:33,838 --> 00:46:38,400
allowing canopy limits because if the

1243
00:46:37,079 --> 00:46:39,839
sea to sailing you're trying to track

1244
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:41,880
you to make sure you keep it off the

1245
00:46:39,838 --> 00:46:44,279
black market but then you give Farmers

1246
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:48,300
the ability to grow an abundant amount

1247
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:50,040
of product that's supply and demand it

1248
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:51,599
doesn't work properly I mean it's

1249
00:46:50,039 --> 00:46:53,639
inevitable that some of it's going to

1250
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:56,099
get to the black market

1251
00:46:53,639 --> 00:46:58,500
the second concern I have is

1252
00:46:56,099 --> 00:47:01,559
commingling medical marijuana

1253
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:03,539
dispensaries with recreational use

1254
00:47:01,559 --> 00:47:04,980
in my mind I I tracked this pretty

1255
00:47:03,539 --> 00:47:07,619
closely I've been part of the industry

1256
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:09,780
for a long time and in my mind

1257
00:47:07,619 --> 00:47:12,300
the medical marijuana dispensary side

1258
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:15,180
was able to be established before the

1259
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:17,818
law was even molded on for recreational

1260
00:47:15,179 --> 00:47:19,318
use so anyone that wants to come into

1261
00:47:17,818 --> 00:47:23,039
the business going through the due

1262
00:47:19,318 --> 00:47:25,858
process of trying to do it with the the

1263
00:47:23,039 --> 00:47:27,960
legal parameters that were given we're

1264
00:47:25,858 --> 00:47:30,539
not given an opportunity I don't know if

1265
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:32,579
you do co-mingle those two there's no

1266
00:47:30,539 --> 00:47:34,259
real reason for you to have any little

1267
00:47:32,579 --> 00:47:36,660
licensing application for the

1268
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:38,760
recreational side

1269
00:47:36,659 --> 00:47:40,618
especially in the city of Portland

1270
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:43,079
if there's that many retailers already

1271
00:47:40,619 --> 00:47:45,000
out there on the medical dispensary side

1272
00:47:43,079 --> 00:47:48,839
and it doesn't give the recreational

1273
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:50,519
side the ability to tap into that market

1274
00:47:48,838 --> 00:47:53,578
what are we doing what are we here for

1275
00:47:50,519 --> 00:47:56,219
if someone buys let's just say a brownie

1276
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:57,480
or even flour or whatever they buy are

1277
00:47:56,219 --> 00:47:59,699
they going to be able to look up where

1278
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:01,619
it came from who grew it

1279
00:47:59,699 --> 00:48:03,419
if it's organic or any of that kind of

1280
00:48:01,619 --> 00:48:04,740
stuff it's going to be tracked all the

1281
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:06,440
way through the system I don't know that

1282
00:48:04,739 --> 00:48:09,479
we're going to make that available

1283
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:11,400
exactly to the person we're more into

1284
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:14,059
tracking the product not necessarily the

1285
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:14,059
product back

1286
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:20,159
and will there be a tax write-off for

1287
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:23,220
people who get outside software to help

1288
00:48:20,159 --> 00:48:25,858
pay for the software for seed to sale as

1289
00:48:23,219 --> 00:48:27,299
we read the bill or as we read the law

1290
00:48:25,858 --> 00:48:29,460
currently there will be those will be

1291
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:31,200
the cost of goods sold and I was just

1292
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:34,440
wondering how you guys were going to

1293
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:35,659
decide who receives the license

1294
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:37,858
so there's been a lot of questions

1295
00:48:35,659 --> 00:48:39,598
sometimes related to licensing there's

1296
00:48:37,858 --> 00:48:41,338
no limit on licenses in the state of

1297
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:42,900
Oregon we always have to choose to do

1298
00:48:41,338 --> 00:48:45,960
that we don't do that in their alcohol

1299
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:48,539
regulation we haven't we aren't down

1300
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:49,920
that path yet but we certainly have

1301
00:48:48,539 --> 00:48:51,659
heard not to have any restrictions on

1302
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:54,240
licenses everywhere we've gone pretty

1303
00:48:51,659 --> 00:48:56,818
much for the most part

1304
00:48:54,239 --> 00:48:58,858
what are the limits on THC per serving

1305
00:48:56,818 --> 00:49:01,500
and per package and what's the yeah

1306
00:48:58,858 --> 00:49:02,818
what's the maximum we haven't set those

1307
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:04,318
limits and those are going to be things

1308
00:49:02,818 --> 00:49:05,880
that we're going to be having a

1309
00:49:04,318 --> 00:49:07,739
conversation with co-working about as we

1310
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:09,539
go through the rules process I know in

1311
00:49:07,739 --> 00:49:11,639
uh in Washington I saw about 100

1312
00:49:09,539 --> 00:49:13,440
milligrams per package and I know

1313
00:49:11,639 --> 00:49:14,519
there's users that use more than that in

1314
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:15,358
a day

1315
00:49:14,519 --> 00:49:16,800
um

1316
00:49:15,358 --> 00:49:17,460
I know that would be expensive I don't

1317
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:20,039
know

1318
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:22,980
yeah we're certainly looking at

1319
00:49:20,039 --> 00:49:25,500
we're certainly looking at setting a

1320
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:27,300
serving size standard which is how we

1321
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:29,219
believe we're going to have to inform

1322
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:30,599
the public about it what that size is

1323
00:49:29,219 --> 00:49:32,459
and how much that is we're going to have

1324
00:49:30,599 --> 00:49:34,440
to you know be able to put out there so

1325
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:36,240
we're not sure what that is I'd like to

1326
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:39,059
say uh

1327
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:42,059
keeping the existing medical

1328
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:45,480
dispensaries and recreational

1329
00:49:42,059 --> 00:49:47,940
dispensaries distinctly separate gives

1330
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:49,619
the recreational dispensaries a more

1331
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:52,460
even

1332
00:49:49,619 --> 00:49:55,140
Lakeville

1333
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:57,838
okay and uh

1334
00:49:55,139 --> 00:50:00,900
the limits on the personal growth

1335
00:49:57,838 --> 00:50:02,880
does it allow for enough of the Next

1336
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:04,980
Generation to keep a Perpetual grow

1337
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:06,539
going

1338
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:09,780
and floor plans isn't going to last

1339
00:50:06,539 --> 00:50:13,500
anybody a year in less than 12 feet tall

1340
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:17,339
my questions first was on a public level

1341
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:19,139
of public transparency will you make the

1342
00:50:17,338 --> 00:50:21,000
public engagement statistics well all

1343
00:50:19,139 --> 00:50:22,679
this information even collecting will

1344
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,659
you make that information public so we

1345
00:50:22,679 --> 00:50:26,818
know that actually what the people have

1346
00:50:24,659 --> 00:50:28,618
spoken is actually reflected upon your

1347
00:50:26,818 --> 00:50:30,179
actions and state and you know yeah I

1348
00:50:28,619 --> 00:50:32,220
think we're summarizing what's what's

1349
00:50:30,179 --> 00:50:33,539
been done so yeah we're trying to make

1350
00:50:32,219 --> 00:50:35,459
that available but we don't have a very

1351
00:50:33,539 --> 00:50:36,659
limited staff I understand yep and then

1352
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:38,818
the secondary question you mentioned the

1353
00:50:36,659 --> 00:50:40,559
40-some items that you sent off the

1354
00:50:38,818 --> 00:50:41,759
legislature for recommendation I was

1355
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:43,380
wondering if that was sent out to be

1356
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:45,960
made publicity mail your email list or

1357
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:47,579
system certainly and where we haven't

1358
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:48,900
adopted it yet we're going to probably

1359
00:50:47,579 --> 00:50:50,880
adopted the commission meeting tomorrow

1360
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:52,740
okay great adapters option it would go

1361
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:54,539
out yeah after adoption it's going to be

1362
00:50:52,739 --> 00:50:57,058
it's a public document as it is but I

1363
00:50:54,539 --> 00:51:00,119
mean yeah exactly available yeah great

1364
00:50:57,059 --> 00:51:02,640
thank you so much uh the the basically

1365
00:51:00,119 --> 00:51:05,818
that my only statements are one just to

1366
00:51:02,639 --> 00:51:07,799
request to treat alcohol uh you know to

1367
00:51:05,818 --> 00:51:09,779
treat the Cannabis similar to alcohol

1368
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:12,300
and tobacco and specifically or alcohol

1369
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:14,880
oil and wine specifically

1370
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:18,240
alcohol 100 plus times the most recent

1371
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:20,940
study more harmful than marijuana

1372
00:51:18,239 --> 00:51:23,279
cannabis medical or otherwise and my

1373
00:51:20,940 --> 00:51:25,858
request is just strongly to reduce

1374
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:27,599
whatever kind of bigotry is involved and

1375
00:51:25,858 --> 00:51:29,219
to sort of have as much fairness and

1376
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:31,859
parity in whatever you're treating

1377
00:51:29,219 --> 00:51:35,039
whatever professional Recreation

1378
00:51:31,858 --> 00:51:36,659
uh and then the last is uh tourism to

1379
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:38,519
make it available for tourism and then

1380
00:51:36,659 --> 00:51:41,098
fencing with the fencing it costs 40

1381
00:51:38,519 --> 00:51:42,719
Grand defense an acre 50 or more eight

1382
00:51:41,099 --> 00:51:44,220
to ten feet high with Cyclone fencing

1383
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:46,259
which takes about 18 seconds to break

1384
00:51:44,219 --> 00:51:48,899
through that same 40 Grand would create

1385
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:51,599
a security system with lasers and lights

1386
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:55,019
and forget the whole nine yards Auto

1387
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:57,480
tracking auto alarms much cheaper and

1388
00:51:55,019 --> 00:51:59,099
much more effective for an electronic

1389
00:51:57,480 --> 00:52:01,199
system than a hardware okay thank you

1390
00:51:59,099 --> 00:52:03,960
and I want to highly recommend that we

1391
00:52:01,199 --> 00:52:06,779
do ban Edibles that are appealing to

1392
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:09,838
kids there's several products that can

1393
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:11,760
be used that aren't attractive to kids

1394
00:52:09,838 --> 00:52:13,739
so I would like to see the Edibles like

1395
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:15,540
the candy and the suckers and the gummy

1396
00:52:13,739 --> 00:52:18,259
bears and all that free band thank you

1397
00:52:15,539 --> 00:52:18,259
thank you very much
