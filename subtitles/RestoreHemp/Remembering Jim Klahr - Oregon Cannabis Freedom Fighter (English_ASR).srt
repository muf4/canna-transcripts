1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:07,040
from from my experience

2
00:00:03,198 --> 00:00:08,960
in the legislation i have found that we

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,559
really don't have anybody in the house

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:14,080
of representatives

5
00:00:10,558 --> 00:00:14,638
who is there to back the wants and the

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,920
needs

7
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:20,399
of regardless of what your part of

8
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:24,160
cannabis is whether you're

9
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:27,278
industrial hemp medicinal marijuana

10
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,679
choice to use or sacrament i believe in

11
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:30,239
them

12
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:32,159
all they all have a place and they

13
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:35,759
should all come together

14
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:38,878
and we need to change what this

15
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:41,119
state for sure needs and to do that we

16
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:45,119
have to be here and we have to be on the

17
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:47,280
inside to do that right now

18
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:49,519
if we want all these changes we talk

19
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,879
about here at this festival

20
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,440
we need to get out there and vote and

21
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:56,079
you know get that ballot in the mail and

22
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:58,878
make you

23
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:00,878
make sure you register i want everybody

24
00:00:58,878 --> 00:01:03,198
to be able to enjoy

25
00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:05,920
what i've been able to enjoy for almost

26
00:01:03,198 --> 00:01:10,158
40 years now

27
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:13,680
and that's cannabis in whatever form you

28
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:17,080
choose to uh believe in it in

29
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:20,799
um i'm also a

30
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:24,840
pre-transplant patient with host hsu

31
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:27,759
and so i'm kind of under their thumb of

32
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:31,200
being held out of the system

33
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:32,478
because i can't use it when i know that

34
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,759
it worked before

35
00:01:32,478 --> 00:01:37,679
for me before i was evaluated and put on

36
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,719
the list so i've been on both sides of

37
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,960
the fence

38
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:41,840
i've used it medicinally to take care of

39
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:45,199
my needs

40
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,320
i know it works my life is basically on

41
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:50,079
the line

42
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:52,000
if i use and they find it in my system

43
00:01:50,078 --> 00:01:53,679
then they'll take me off the list they

44
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,560
might as well shoot me right then and

45
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,118
there

46
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,920
and this is a type of bias that we don't

47
00:01:57,118 --> 00:02:01,118
need

48
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,159
in our world much less our state much

49
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:04,799
less

50
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,159
this district everybody should be able

51
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,280
to do what they want

52
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:13,680
and long before that i was a farmer

53
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:16,719
and it's time that farmers are no longer

54
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:19,520
slave labor they need to be

55
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:22,639
paid for what they do and paid

56
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,640
righteously so

57
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,239
and our new transitional healthcare

58
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,560
bring

59
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:39,680
cannabis into it from a positive

60
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:43,519
section to where the oha

61
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:46,719
starts protecting any of the clinics

62
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:49,120
any of the growers any of the patients

63
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:50,878
from outside intervention if you don't

64
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,560
like what people are doing

65
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:54,318
and don't want to give them the best

66
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,640
health care they can

67
00:02:54,318 --> 00:02:58,238
then you really don't give a if

68
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:01,439
they live or die

69
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:05,200
and those type of people don't belong

70
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:08,878
in any sort of political politic

71
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:11,280
uh position or uh office

72
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:12,799
uh i'm running for state office because

73
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,158
i think we gotta

74
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:18,239
really clean up what we got going here

75
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:20,239
and hopefully those changes just like

76
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:23,439
our model law did

77
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:26,239
years ago and those type of things drip

78
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:29,519
downward and outward just like it will

79
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:33,120
as more and more states come online

80
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:37,360
with whatever form of legalization they

81
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,360
choose to do
