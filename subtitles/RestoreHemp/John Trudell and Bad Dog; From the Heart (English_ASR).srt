00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:03,899
hello

2
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:29,420
thank you

3
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:52,260
from the heart there are times I turned

4
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,620
out crooked

5
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:59,399
and times I turned on down

6
00:00:55,619 --> 00:01:04,099
there are times I just kept trying

7
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:04,099
and times I just went without

8
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:11,579
there are times I felt like screaming

9
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:15,240
and times I probably did

10
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:19,640
there are times I can't quite remember

11
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:19,640
and times I can never forget

12
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:27,240
there are times love is a shadow

13
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:30,019
and times love is a change

14
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:35,298
there are times Love Is The Life

15
00:01:30,019 --> 00:01:35,298
and Times love is to blame

16
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,540
oh

17
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:56,280
from the heart there are times when a

18
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,640
smile is a smile

19
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:02,700
and times when it is not

20
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:06,540
there are times time buys

21
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:08,640
and times time bought

22
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:10,860
there are times

23
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:14,399
I went way out there

24
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:17,700
and times I never came back

25
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:21,860
there are times of great feeling and

26
00:02:17,699 --> 00:02:21,859
times I don't feel a thing

27
00:02:23,878 --> 00:02:26,878
shadow

28
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:36,000
and times love is a chain

29
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:41,000
there are times love is the light

30
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
and times love is to blame

31
00:02:55,818 --> 00:03:03,299
there are times I keep waiting for

32
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:05,400
and times that are never going to come

33
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,599
there are times I could have done

34
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:10,519
different

35
00:03:06,598 --> 00:03:13,738
and times different isn't there

36
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:15,780
from the hood there are times the

37
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:20,519
balance is balance

38
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:23,400
and times the rush is too extreme

39
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:24,780
there are times it's all I can do to

40
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:29,360
live

41
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:29,360
in times I'm glad that I do

42
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,840
foreign
