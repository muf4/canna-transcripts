1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:05,199
thank you very much for inviting me to

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:07,798
participate and I would especially like

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:10,679
to say I'm very pleased that Hempfest is

4
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:13,039
held every year in the 36 legislative

5
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:17,000
district which I represent in the state

6
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:20,399
senate and a year ago actually August

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,599
20th former representative Toby Nixon

8
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:27,479
Republican and libertarian and I had an

9
00:00:23,599 --> 00:00:30,518
oped published in the Seattle Times in

10
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:33,759
which we commended Hempfest in its

11
00:00:30,518 --> 00:00:35,719
mission statement for quote uh saying

12
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:38,199
that the public is better served when

13
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:40,719
citizens and public officials work

14
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:43,879
cooperatively in order to successfully

15
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:48,359
accomplish common goals and while I'm

16
00:00:43,878 --> 00:00:51,079
about I got 99 plus% positive that

17
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:55,280
people here at this forum and throughout

18
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:57,679
hempest have common goals which I share

19
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:01,198
I'm not sure that everyone in the public

20
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:03,759
has that common goal or go goals and

21
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:06,359
what I would like to talk about briefly

22
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:10,319
is my perspective as a

23
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:13,799
legislator in terms of providing and

24
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:16,839
furthering our protections for patients

25
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:19,520
qualified patients who are using medical

26
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:22,920
marijuana or cannabis uh with the

27
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:25,798
authorization of their doctors and other

28
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:28,560
licensed medical professionals and also

29
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:30,880
the issue of legalization where do we go

30
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,399
from here like to just give a very short

31
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:37,438
background on what we've done here in

32
00:01:32,399 --> 00:01:39,280
Washington state as we know 14 States

33
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:42,919
since the early

34
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:45,879
1970s have provided uh the opportunity

35
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:48,840
for states to enact

36
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:52,359
decriminalization statutes unfortunately

37
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:56,478
Washington state is not one of those 14

38
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:59,879
States and uh we have tried the last two

39
00:01:56,478 --> 00:02:02,359
years with legislation I introduced to

40
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:04,319
have that accomplished it's not worked

41
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:07,079
and so we have to decide now what we

42
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:10,239
want to do I focus on public

43
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:13,120
policymaking and what strategy may be

44
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:15,360
the most viable to reach the common goal

45
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:19,319
that we have I'm also going to talk

46
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:22,280
about the medical marijuana issues and

47
00:02:19,318 --> 00:02:26,079
starting back in 1995 when I received a

48
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:28,598
call from Joanna mcke the Irreplaceable

49
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,480
phenomenal Joanna mck to get involved

50
00:02:28,598 --> 00:02:32,919
with medical marijuana

51
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:35,119
I started introducing legislation my

52
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:37,878
sister-in-law had died a few years

53
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:41,239
earlier of cancer and she found medical

54
00:02:37,878 --> 00:02:44,039
marijuana to help her with uh the

55
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:46,560
horrible pain and suffering and nausea

56
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:49,560
that she had from chemotherapy and

57
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:53,120
radiation and then in 1998 my best

58
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:55,719
friend died while we were deliberating

59
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,000
legislation I'd introduced on medical

60
00:02:55,719 --> 00:03:01,000
marijuana which we did not get through

61
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,280
so I gladly joined with the the forces

62
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,199
to work on getting initiative

63
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:10,199
692 approved by the voters in 1998 led

64
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:13,039
by uh Dr Rob Killian and many

65
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:15,318
organizations which did get

66
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:18,000
accomplished uh since then I've worked

67
00:03:15,318 --> 00:03:20,479
to try to make sure that it works

68
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,439
effectively that the law works and

69
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:26,280
that's when we get into a Nexus between

70
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:29,959
legislation that goes through the

71
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:33,680
legislative process citizen activist

72
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:36,438
which is essential and thirdly raising

73
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,640
the visibility and understanding of the

74
00:03:36,438 --> 00:03:42,239
public and the mainstream public who

75
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:43,798
don't really know the ACLU had conducted

76
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:47,239
polls that showed that there was

77
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:50,319
widespread support of that and

78
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:52,759
eventually we were able to enact some

79
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:55,280
changes to make things more readily

80
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:57,639
available for qualified patients to help

81
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:00,400
out providers and

82
00:03:57,639 --> 00:04:03,719
Physicians this last session

83
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:07,360
we enacted legislation I introduced to

84
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:10,560
allow for all licensed medical providers

85
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:13,840
to provide the authorization for

86
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:17,280
qualified uh patients to be able to

87
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:19,759
utilize um cannabis or medical marijuana

88
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:21,839
but we still have a lot left to do there

89
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:24,199
and with regard to the medical use of

90
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:26,079
marijuana I've been working with

91
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:30,319
organizations

92
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:32,519
individuals uh State officials to refine

93
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:35,759
legislation that I'll be introducing

94
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:38,879
next year in 2012 when the legislature

95
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:43,360
convenes in January it will be an

96
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:45,319
Omnibus medical marijuana cannabis act

97
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:49,879
because we know that there's a lot left

98
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:53,959
to do uh we need to provide for a safe

99
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:57,959
well regulated secure and consistent

100
00:04:53,959 --> 00:05:00,799
source of marijuana and something that

101
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:04,918
patients and providers can access

102
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:08,079
without threat of arrest and prosecution

103
00:05:04,918 --> 00:05:11,159
our current statute only allows for an

104
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:14,359
affirmative defense which is really not

105
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:16,960
much at all and as Dominic Holden

106
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:19,759
brought out in the stranger last week I

107
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:22,519
think it was that the arrests have gone

108
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:25,840
up dramatically even in the city of

109
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:29,159
Seattle which has an

110
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:32,638
ordinance that marijuana will have the

111
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:35,280
lead least priority for arrest in the

112
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:37,199
city of Seattle so that's pretty

113
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:40,799
shocking the bill that I will be

114
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:42,439
introducing will also besides providing

115
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:46,560
for

116
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:49,680
protection against arrest and

117
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:52,600
prosecution will change the limitations

118
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:56,360
as well that designated providers may

119
00:05:52,600 --> 00:06:01,160
only serve one patient at any one point

120
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:04,439
in time uh secondly it will allow for

121
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:07,240
recip reciprocity for authorized

122
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:10,759
patients visiting from any state that

123
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:14,560
has legal use of medical

124
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:17,280
marijuana uh thirdly it'll provide from

125
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:20,800
restrictions of or protections from

126
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:25,519
restrictions of parental rights without

127
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:29,759
any proof of um excuse me without any

128
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:32,680
proof of uh parents not being able to to

129
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:35,800
provide the their performance of

130
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:39,079
Parental functions adequately it will

131
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:42,319
also provide protections from negative

132
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:44,680
consequences of for work

133
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:48,360
related uh

134
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:50,519
situations offsite as long as the use of

135
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:54,160
medical marijuana is authorized and does

136
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:57,799
not have any effect on the pay on the

137
00:06:54,160 --> 00:07:00,879
individual's performance of work

138
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:02,598
responsibilities uh and also also and

139
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:05,319
this is another very important part of

140
00:07:02,598 --> 00:07:08,120
the legislation that we're working on

141
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:09,759
that we will create a system for

142
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:14,720
licensing and

143
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:16,919
regulation of production and dispensing

144
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,800
of medical marijuana for qualified

145
00:07:16,918 --> 00:07:22,038
patients through the Department of

146
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:25,800
Agriculture and the Department of Health

147
00:07:22,038 --> 00:07:29,038
so really it's a big step forward if we

148
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:31,560
can get through the provisions but as a

149
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:34,639
leg legislator I know that what has to

150
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:37,399
happen is we have to convince a majority

151
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:39,800
of legislators to get that accomplished

152
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:42,519
which is where many of you come in to

153
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:45,360
help persuade legislators that this is

154
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:48,519
really really important to do with

155
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,960
regard to the discussion of

156
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:53,799
legalization I had been convinced two

157
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:55,120
years ago that the best way to go about

158
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:59,918
getting to

159
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:02,959
that stage was to have dereg

160
00:07:59,918 --> 00:08:05,758
ulation come about first as I mentioned

161
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:07,439
earlier we're not one of the 14 states

162
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:10,479
that allow for

163
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:13,158
deregulation dating back to the

164
00:08:10,478 --> 00:08:16,478
1970s and it seemed like too much of a

165
00:08:13,158 --> 00:08:19,560
leap for the public to accept and for

166
00:08:16,478 --> 00:08:22,279
legislators too uh that we go the full

167
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:25,240
legalization route but I have since been

168
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:28,158
convinced through the incredible work of

169
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:29,918
sensible Washington which has raised the

170
00:08:28,158 --> 00:08:33,319
visibility in the public

171
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:35,079
dramatically and as well as other groups

172
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:36,800
working on this issue that we should

173
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:38,440
tackle legalization it's going to be

174
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:41,120
interesting to see what happens in

175
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:43,719
California in November with their

176
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:46,360
initiative and Douglas hayed who will be

177
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:49,160
speaking and I've had many conversations

178
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:51,320
about this this is a good example of

179
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:54,000
supporting the common goals but maybe

180
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:55,800
having a different approach I think it's

181
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
very important to work on this

182
00:08:55,799 --> 00:09:01,719
legislatively first uh so that we can

183
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:05,240
raise ra the profile in the public for

184
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:09,240
the more mainstream public who may not

185
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:12,278
get it otherwise but secondly I wish

186
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:15,959
that the initiative that apparently is

187
00:09:12,278 --> 00:09:20,078
being um offered in

188
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:22,639
2011 would do two things one provide

189
00:09:20,078 --> 00:09:25,958
regulation because although delas will

190
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:29,319
say that the legislature can provide

191
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:33,799
regulation it takes 2/3 vote of the

192
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:36,560
legislature to amend an initiative after

193
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:38,519
it's approved by the voters after 2

194
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:40,039
years it's a simple majority but the

195
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:43,399
legislature

196
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:46,360
really very very rarely amends an

197
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:49,078
initiative they don't like to do that uh

198
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:51,320
so I'd rather have regulations within

199
00:09:49,078 --> 00:09:53,599
the initiative Lang language or

200
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:55,640
directions to the appropriate agencies

201
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:58,320
or the local government such as in the

202
00:09:55,639 --> 00:10:01,078
case with the California initiative and

203
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:03,760
secondly I think 2012 would be a better

204
00:10:01,078 --> 00:10:05,479
year with more likelihood of getting the

205
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:07,919
measure approved by the voters because

206
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:10,600
it'll be a huge voter turnout year with

207
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:12,240
a presidential election a gubernatorial

208
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:16,440
election

209
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:19,000
2011 elections are city and county ones

210
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:22,600
they're just not going to have the pull

211
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,679
uh to get as many voters out but again I

212
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:27,200
support the goals we need to move

213
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:29,719
forward and if a citizen initiative is

214
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,399
the way to do it that's fine with me and

215
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:33,879
I will work on it but I want to make

216
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:37,039
sure that we're approaching it in the

217
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:40,039
most effective way thank

218
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:40,039
you
