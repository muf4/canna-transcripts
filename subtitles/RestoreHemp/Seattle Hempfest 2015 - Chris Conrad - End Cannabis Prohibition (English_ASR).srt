1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,769
alright so I take a few you people who

2
00:00:03,569 --> 00:00:09,449
spoke to me before alright well I'm glad

3
00:00:07,769 --> 00:00:11,009
to hear that because I would have talked

4
00:00:09,449 --> 00:00:14,548
about the past the present and the

5
00:00:11,009 --> 00:00:15,718
future and get an idea what I'm thinking

6
00:00:14,548 --> 00:00:17,309
from Sonny's going around for a long

7
00:00:15,718 --> 00:00:20,608
time I first want to start off by

8
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:22,649
mentioning my dear friends Kevin black

9
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:24,660
and and Peter McWilliams both of whom

10
00:00:22,649 --> 00:00:28,528
are friends of personal friends of mine

11
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:31,890
and the stage is honoring them so i say

12
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:34,140
honor them with high honor peter

13
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:39,689
mcwilliams and kevin black two wonderful

14
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:42,020
activist so as far as the past is

15
00:00:39,689 --> 00:00:44,128
concerned I spent a lot of time in court

16
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:46,200
working to keep people out of prison

17
00:00:44,128 --> 00:00:48,718
almost every day I'm in court working on

18
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:50,850
that and so I am a very good sense I've

19
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,129
been doing this for 20 years plus a fee

20
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,840
and expert witness and we're seeing a

21
00:00:53,128 --> 00:00:55,919
change in the way the cases are working

22
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,960
and we're seeing a change in the

23
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,600
attitude around the country but we're

24
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,609
also seeing the fact that we're getting

25
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,260
rolled back at different parts of the

26
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:07,260
world some of what's going on here in

27
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:09,960
Washington for example it's not exactly

28
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:12,719
what people envisioned when we pass

29
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:15,539
i-502 here are a few years ago to

30
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:17,400
legalize cannabis it's like God but it

31
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:19,020
wasn't supposed to affect medical

32
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,210
marijuana yet look at the problems is

33
00:01:19,019 --> 00:01:22,950
causing in California we have the

34
00:01:21,209 --> 00:01:25,019
legislature it's got a bill that claims

35
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:27,000
to be a marijuana reform bill but what

36
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:29,250
they're going to do is take away legal

37
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,099
defenses from pot growers who are not

38
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:35,250
licensed by the state though we've had

39
00:01:32,099 --> 00:01:37,140
ever since 2003 and so that's as their

40
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:39,328
idea of reform is to make it so that

41
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:41,670
some people will get licenses but other

42
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:43,889
people lose their legal defense and so

43
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:46,228
the other thing that we're seeing is

44
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:48,689
that this whole idea of testing people's

45
00:01:46,228 --> 00:01:51,118
urine as a part of a condition for

46
00:01:48,688 --> 00:01:53,250
getting a job or to have a license these

47
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:56,759
issues are not going away we call it the

48
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:59,129
can of bigotry it's like the Jim Crow of

49
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:02,430
cannabis is what we're setting upon us

50
00:01:59,129 --> 00:02:04,408
right now and so some of these things

51
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:06,060
that we're seeing as we see Barry former

52
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:08,310
thinking we also are concerned about

53
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:10,319
where things are going so when we look

54
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,929
at the past one of the things it's a big

55
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,968
fear

56
00:02:10,929 --> 00:02:15,968
me as we see this big change that's

57
00:02:12,968 --> 00:02:18,009
happening now is that the history of the

58
00:02:15,968 --> 00:02:20,289
struggle to get us to this moment can

59
00:02:18,009 --> 00:02:23,199
very well be lost and we can't afford to

60
00:02:20,289 --> 00:02:24,548
let that happen we've got people who've

61
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:26,259
been sitting in prison for 20 years

62
00:02:24,549 --> 00:02:28,810
we've got people who've been working as

63
00:02:26,259 --> 00:02:30,699
activist for decades we've got a history

64
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:33,579
of people who worked underground people

65
00:02:30,699 --> 00:02:35,468
who kept the gene pool alive and so

66
00:02:33,579 --> 00:02:37,450
forth through all these decades and we

67
00:02:35,468 --> 00:02:38,949
need to protect an honor that I'm

68
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:41,348
working with a group that's called the

69
00:02:38,949 --> 00:02:43,418
420 archive and we're trying to approach

70
00:02:41,348 --> 00:02:45,429
this from three different directions the

71
00:02:43,419 --> 00:02:47,739
first is to get the archives of people

72
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:51,549
who've been contributors to the field of

73
00:02:47,739 --> 00:02:54,009
Canada's reform and preserves out the

74
00:02:51,549 --> 00:02:55,870
second is to create collections and to

75
00:02:54,009 --> 00:02:58,568
coordinate collections of museum

76
00:02:55,870 --> 00:03:01,209
exhibits of material that goes before

77
00:02:58,568 --> 00:03:03,488
cannabis was ever prohibited and up

78
00:03:01,209 --> 00:03:05,438
through the history are the prohibition

79
00:03:03,489 --> 00:03:07,870
and to create that is something that we

80
00:03:05,438 --> 00:03:10,090
can leave for future generations and the

81
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:12,609
third thing is it can oral our oral

82
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:14,620
histories of people who can using

83
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:16,299
cannabis underground and going

84
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:18,250
underground and working in the cannabis

85
00:03:16,299 --> 00:03:20,049
industry underground that have never

86
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:22,359
been free to tell their stories before

87
00:03:20,049 --> 00:03:25,150
so those stories of the people who

88
00:03:22,359 --> 00:03:26,799
risked many years in prison to make sure

89
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:31,389
that people had some nice herb to smoke

90
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:33,280
it's not lost in history so I hope

91
00:03:31,389 --> 00:03:35,199
you'll join us in looking at the 420

92
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,568
archive and make sure that histories

93
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:41,109
preserve the next thing is about to now

94
00:03:37,568 --> 00:03:44,138
and the now is is that as cannabis moves

95
00:03:41,109 --> 00:03:45,879
out of us outlaws status we have a big

96
00:03:44,139 --> 00:03:47,500
fear that what's going to happen is big

97
00:03:45,878 --> 00:03:48,848
corporations when they come in and

98
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:51,280
they're going to try to take over

99
00:03:48,848 --> 00:03:54,008
control of the work they are friends and

100
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,359
our neighbors in and the people who've

101
00:03:54,008 --> 00:03:58,508
been the growers and so forth for so

102
00:03:55,359 --> 00:04:00,489
long have been working for enough patent

103
00:03:58,508 --> 00:04:02,018
the seat lines and stuff like that so

104
00:04:00,489 --> 00:04:04,840
I'm working with a group called the open

105
00:04:02,019 --> 00:04:07,900
cannabis project and our plan is to try

106
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:09,908
to get a final way of explaining what

107
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:11,739
the different seed lines are in turn to

108
00:04:09,908 --> 00:04:14,168
the genetics and their effects and so

109
00:04:11,739 --> 00:04:15,878
forth but also to preserve them and

110
00:04:14,169 --> 00:04:18,668
create the public domain directors that

111
00:04:15,878 --> 00:04:20,569
these already exist so that Monsanto and

112
00:04:18,668 --> 00:04:22,789
corporations like that can't come

113
00:04:20,569 --> 00:04:24,709
and patent those seeds and make you

114
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:26,000
always have to pay for it we want to

115
00:04:24,709 --> 00:04:28,639
make sure that you'll always be able to

116
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,470
grow your og cush and your blueberry not

117
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:33,860
have to pay some corporation who comes

118
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:35,210
in and buys that trademark away so the

119
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:37,280
name of that group is called you're

120
00:04:35,209 --> 00:04:40,310
hoping cannabis project it's got three

121
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:43,399
parts to protect access to the seed line

122
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:45,230
to exist now to protect the integrity so

123
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:46,849
when people tell you that this is a blue

124
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:50,330
dream that you know it's really a blue

125
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:52,250
dream and not oh gee cush both of which

126
00:04:50,329 --> 00:04:53,689
is good i'm not knocking either one but

127
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:56,540
you want to know what you're getting

128
00:04:53,689 --> 00:04:58,639
right and the third thing is to get the

129
00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:03,439
genome map so look we will know for sure

130
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:05,360
from here on out okay and so then the

131
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:07,939
next thing i want to say is is that

132
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,710
where we're heading toward in the future

133
00:05:07,939 --> 00:05:12,350
has things have shifted really

134
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:14,269
dramatically and now we have dr. Sanjay

135
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:16,189
Gupta changing his position on marijuana

136
00:05:14,269 --> 00:05:18,620
which is like the whole massive shift

137
00:05:16,189 --> 00:05:21,350
which was much last week when the New

138
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:23,090
York Times came out in favor of taking

139
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:25,910
marijuana out of the federal controlled

140
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:27,649
substance act and this is really hugely

141
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:29,660
important this is something we've been

142
00:05:27,649 --> 00:05:31,519
saying for a long time and now finally

143
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:34,850
we've got the New York Times doing it to

144
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:36,560
say it so I predicting the future of

145
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:38,480
canvases that we are going to see more

146
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,819
in greater hempfest in the future

147
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:42,259
morning Draenor free of the future of

148
00:05:40,819 --> 00:05:46,129
protection of all you've got an

149
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:47,899
expansion of our rights and wait wait

150
00:05:46,129 --> 00:05:49,610
you want to join to the more important

151
00:05:47,899 --> 00:05:51,469
things is that we need more people

152
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:53,509
smoking herb and more people to

153
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:55,070
understand it that's why written a book

154
00:05:53,509 --> 00:05:57,139
which has caused the newbies guide to

155
00:05:55,069 --> 00:05:59,659
canvas in the industry going to be out

156
00:05:57,139 --> 00:06:01,699
this year and so if you know people who

157
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:03,080
should be smoking weed where who should

158
00:06:01,699 --> 00:06:04,670
be in the weed business that you want to

159
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:06,649
make sure they get it right and don't

160
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:08,810
screw themselves through each other and

161
00:06:06,649 --> 00:06:10,159
they understand what's going on Tommy's

162
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:12,439
get a copy that book for Christmas

163
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:15,840
alright and so then the last thing I

164
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:19,779
wanted to say is that

165
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:22,119
