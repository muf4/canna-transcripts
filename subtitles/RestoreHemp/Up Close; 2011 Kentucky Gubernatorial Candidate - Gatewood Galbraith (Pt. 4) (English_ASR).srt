1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,839
I say how can I say this? You can't

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:09,039
believe how advanced we are as an

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:12,638
independent ticket. Independent scares

4
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:14,718
the be Jesus out of the powers that be.

5
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:17,919
Independent means that they don't have

6
00:00:14,718 --> 00:00:19,480
any power over you. They can't instill

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,600
party

8
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:23,278
partisanship. We are absolutely

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,679
unaffiliated with anybody. All we want

10
00:00:23,278 --> 00:00:28,480
to do is what's right for the people.

11
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:30,640
And if we can set that template, if we

12
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,439
can show it can be done, there's going

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,960
to be a popular

14
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:38,159
uprising. There's going to be we will be

15
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,239
defeating money that's 10 times 20 times

16
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:42,000
what we

17
00:00:39,238 --> 00:00:43,359
have. But if your votes not for sale, it

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,280
doesn't make any difference how much

19
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:49,399
money the other side spends. That's

20
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:53,600
true. And the word is out. The buzz is

21
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:57,920
us. the state employees, 38,000 people,

22
00:00:53,600 --> 00:01:00,160
they hate they hate the present governor

23
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,679
and they're all for us. The the head of

24
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:02,959
the union has already come to us and

25
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:08,000
say, "Hey, we're out there working for

26
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:10,000
you right now." You know, the u the we

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,719
came out against mountaintop removal

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,040
that made

29
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:18,798
extremely ecologically uh uh destructive

30
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,400
way of extracting coal. We came out

31
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:23,200
against it. We're the only candidates

32
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:26,000
against it. I've got the only one

33
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,799
running mate who's a woman. She's the

34
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,560
only woman in the race. There's 350,000

35
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,520
more women vote in that race than men

36
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,280
do. I only need 450,000 votes to win

37
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:37,039
this

38
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:39,840
thing, you know. So, we got the we got

39
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,680
the the the environmentalist. We have

40
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,799
the

41
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:45,280
military. I' I've got honorable

42
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:48,320
discharge from Marine Corps. And I tell

43
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,840
you, this present governor, the uh who's

44
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:52,519
going to have the Democratic nomination

45
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:58,000
because he's an incumbent, the other

46
00:01:52,519 --> 00:02:00,319
day, he uh he did not go to a gathering

47
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,399
at Fort Campbell where President Obama

48
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:03,959
came down to honor the Navy Seals who

49
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:07,359
took out

50
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:08,799
Osama. Our governor refused to go down

51
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:11,598
with him because he didn't want to have

52
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,360
his picture taken with Obama.

53
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:14,878
He said he had some he had to be talking

54
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,160
with some other business leaders in the

55
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:18,439
state at that time. So he couldn't

56
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:20,799
afford to change his

57
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:23,039
schedule. And so I thought that was an

58
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,680
affront to every military person in the

59
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:26,959
whole damn state that he was too

60
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,879
cowardly. He didn't want his picture

61
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:31,598
taken with Obama because Obama was

62
00:02:28,878 --> 00:02:33,359
roundly defeated in Kentucky. But there

63
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:35,919
comes times when you've got to set aside

64
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,400
that kind of partisanship and exercise

65
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:40,639
some common sense and pay homage to

66
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,400
brave people like those Navy Seals who

67
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:45,639
went in there and did something that I'm

68
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:50,159
sure a lot of us like to have seen

69
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:53,719
done. And so uh he's roundly and roundly

70
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:56,519
uh roundly dis disgusted a lot of

71
00:02:53,719 --> 00:02:59,680
people. So he is ready for a big

72
00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:01,360
downfall and the Republican is uh just

73
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,319
he's not he's not going to make it. The

74
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,920
Republican is toast already. So we have

75
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:08,639
an extremely weak field that we're

76
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:11,039
running against and so we ought to win

77
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:14,279
this thing is we can just put up a

78
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:18,000
modicum of credibility and

79
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:20,239
responsibility. So uh you know kind of

80
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,840
you know it's kind of like the NBA

81
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,920
finals. Your team might not be in the

82
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,080
finals when they may be as a half a

83
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:27,799
continent away, but you know, take pay

84
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,599
attention to them box scores there in

85
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:31,120
Kentucky. They're going to be fun to

86
00:03:29,598 --> 00:03:35,199
keep up with. We're going to get a lot

87
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:37,920
of national and international attention.

88
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:41,039
So, Gatewood, we got time for one more

89
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:42,559
little uh stump speech here. Let's show

90
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:45,280
them your book and your website and tell

91
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,878
them how they can get in touch with you.

92
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,719
Folks, this book right here is called

93
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:51,199
The Last Free Man in America Meets the

94
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:53,919
Synthetic Subversion. It was a number

95
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:56,798
one seller at a major market for 11

96
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:58,238
straight weeks. And an exgovernor says

97
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,640
it's the best statement of freedom in

98
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:03,200
America he's ever read. This is a fun

99
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:05,119
book, folks. I left out 100% of the sex

100
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:09,959
and 80% of the drugs, but it's still a

101
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:12,799
kick-ass read. So, the uh you can go to

102
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:15,120
gatewood.com to get our political get

103

donation in return, but after I send you

00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:28,159

Send me some money if you like the book.

110
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,160

world can contribute to us, folks. We

113
00:04:33,918 --> 00:04:38,560

the country thus far. If you're a big

115
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,918
dog, I mean, if you're a big dog, come

116
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:45,680
on. Jesus Christ. What was it going to

117
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:48,399
take to get you guys out here to get

118
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:51,040
this thing done? You know, I know people

119
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:53,439
who uh who are helping out uh the

120
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,600
marijuana policy project, I think, has

121
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:57,918
as a couple of big donors uh of an

122
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,520
insurance, of course. Yeah. A big

123
00:04:57,918 --> 00:05:01,758
insurance company. He says he's going to

124
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:04,240
put an initiative for medical marijuana

125
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:06,400
on the Ohio ballot. He just came out the

126
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,478
past few weeks and said that. Look, you

127
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:11,519
couldn't put your money in any more

128
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:13,519
honorable place than to try to get

129
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:15,918
marijuana as a medicine in the hands of

130
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:19,038
the sick and dying people of the United

131
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:21,519
States of America. You just with that

132
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:24,120
money, you could buy relief from people

133
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:27,279
who right now are suffering from chronic

134
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:29,120
pain. from people who suffer all day

135
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:31,839
from chronic pain. You could bring

136
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:34,478
immediate relief to those people with

137
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:38,038
the proper application and direction of

138
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:40,240
really a very small amount of money. So

139
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:41,918
gatewood.com, get in touch with me. I'm

140
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,400

141
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:46,399

relief to your own soul because you you

143
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:50,560

144
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,759
after you get this done. All right.

145

Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir. I want

146

00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:58,159
Thank you. I must uh have the honor of

148
00:05:55,918 --> 00:05:58,159
