1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:04,838
nice to be back in Portland doing this

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:07,040
particular event we go back a long ways

3
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:10,120
doing things together in this day don't

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,120
we yes we

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:15,080
do for many many years I live very far

6
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:17,198
from here down in Florida and you

7
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:19,480
invited me to come and speak to your

8
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:21,600
legislators and you invited me to come

9
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:24,518
and do some television shows with you

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,720
Paul and you invited me to come and get

11
00:00:24,518 --> 00:00:29,239
some signatures with you John S and

12
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:30,879
there are so many others that I'm not

13
00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:33,238
even going to start the list but the one

14
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:37,759
thing I've learned is that people in

15
00:00:33,238 --> 00:00:37,759
Oregon are the coolest of them

16
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,800
all and there are beautiful cool people

17
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,558
all over the planet and the more you

18
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:47,359
know about cannabis the more you're

19
00:00:44,558 --> 00:00:50,878
going to join them and and understand

20
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:54,558
who you really are you're the largest

21
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:58,198
minority in the United

22
00:00:54,558 --> 00:01:00,599
States there are there is no segment of

23
00:00:58,198 --> 00:01:03,479
our society

24
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:07,400
no religion no color no Creed no

25
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:10,280
Financial background that escapes it we

26
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:13,159
all love

27
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:14,920
cannabis and those who never smoke

28
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:16,799
cannabis well you got to feel a little

29
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:19,799
sorry for them because they're they're

30
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:22,280
not in connection with their inner being

31
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:24,400
for the simple reason that there are

32
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:26,920
receptors in their brain that have not

33
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,439
been open for them to understand who

34
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:34,399
they really are but the most the more

35
00:01:29,438 --> 00:01:36,239
you know about this ancient tribal herb

36
00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:38,640
the one that was given to you on the

37
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:40,679
third day if you go by the Bible that's

38
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,399
the one the Judea one we accept mostly

39
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:46,399
in the United States on the third day he

40
00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:50,239
said behold I've given unto you every

41
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:52,840
seed bearing or remember everyone not

42
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:54,239
just the ones that DEA

43
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,039
[Music]

44
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:59,959
likes you are a part of something that

45
00:01:57,039 --> 00:02:03,920
goes beyond time and marijuana has all

46
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:07,919
always been in your system even if you

47
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:11,560
never took a puff because it's been in

48
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:14,080
your system generation after generation

49
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:16,000
after generation and the fact that too

50
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:19,719
many people don't have it in their

51
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,840
system now I suspect contributes a great

52
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:25,000
deal to all the immune deficiencies that

53
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:26,840
are striking so many different parts of

54
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,280
our

55
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:31,640
bodies I think you all know that I

56
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:36,479
received I smoked 10 joints today and

57
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:36,479
Uncle Sam is my supplier you know that

58
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:42,598
right there are five of us in the entire

59
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:45,519
country who actually walking are walking

60
00:02:42,598 --> 00:02:47,560
around with a prescription not a

61
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,480
recommendation you all keep saying your

62
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:51,759
doctors are prescribing marijuana and

63
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:53,878
all the federal government will come

64
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:56,639
very hard on them if they attempt to do

65
00:02:53,878 --> 00:03:00,000
such a thing but there are five doctors

66
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:03,359
that have been approved by FDA DEA and

67
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,719
Ida to write prescriptions for us you

68
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:09,879
know

69
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:12,400
why because we were forced to exercise

70
00:03:09,878 --> 00:03:15,560
our instincts of

71
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:18,319
self-preservation our you're not doing

72
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:21,120
the same if you're taking care of your

73
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:24,639
illness because we understood that a

74
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:27,438
man-made law could not possibly wipe

75
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:30,438
away our common sense when it came to

76
00:03:27,438 --> 00:03:33,639
survival or to maintain the lovely the

77
00:03:30,438 --> 00:03:36,759
beautiful gift of sight that I am BL

78
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:39,598
blessed with however limited it may be I

79
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:41,079
see stars and I see the colors you wear

80
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:42,959
and when you're close to me I see you

81
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:45,719
smiling and I know we're working

82
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:48,878
together and this Earth brought me to

83
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:52,079
you because the person I was before I

84
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:53,078
smoked it or used it is someone I don't

85
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:55,319
even

86
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:57,519
recognize I don't know I was a different

87
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:59,438
person growing with a different set of

88
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:02,480
values one that said you know you get

89
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:04,759
the house you get the nicest clothes you

90
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:07,119
look really sharp all the time and all

91
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:08,959
this kind of crazy stuff and then you

92
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,920
you realize one day that the thing you

93
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:15,120
need most is your health in my case my

94
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:17,759
sight and there is a crazy law that some

95
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,879
crazy people have created that says I

96
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,959
don't have the right to

97
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:23,759
self-preservation or to maintain my

98
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:26,360
sight well I argue that in court because

99
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:29,280
I knew no government had the right to

100
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:32,680
demand blindness out of me or you or the

101
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:36,119
kind of suffering this prohibition is

102
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:39,600
maintaining yeah I [ __ ] the law and I

103
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:43,199
won I [ __ ] the law and I

104
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:45,360
want we got to fight it I am not any

105
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:48,000
Freer than you are as long as you're not

106
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,400
free I'm not I'm glad that I was a part

107
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,160
of all of these different organizations

108
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:54,279
that are here in Oregon that when it

109
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,039
comes time to vote for something

110
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:58,519
important you put your personal

111
00:04:56,038 --> 00:05:01,719
differences aside and you come to the

112
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:05,839
plate and we do work together and we do

113
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:08,680
make things happen oh well there was the

114
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:11,198

00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:22,360
to see dispensaries where patients can

00:05:20,038 --> 00:05:25,800
enjoy and relax with each other's

120

company while they medicate and yes I do

want to sign your petition meline I

122
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:32,919
think a national petition is well

123
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:34,719
overdue I worked on one in the '90s and

124
00:05:32,918 --> 00:05:36,560
didn't quite get it to the justice

125
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,240
department like I wanted well I actually

126
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,639
did but I didn't leave everybody's

127
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:43,038
address is there anyway I want to thank

128
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:46,360
you for letting me do this take care of

129
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:49,478
yourselves make cannabis legal in every

130
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:52,080
way you possibly can educate your

131
00:05:49,478 --> 00:05:54,519
legislators to the fact that when a

132
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:57,800
man-made laws contrary to the law of

133
00:05:54,519 --> 00:06:01,240
nature it has no validity anytime

134
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:04,079
anywhere under any circumstances and let

135
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:08,478
the true Spirit of love always feed your

136
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:08,478
Guiding Light thank you
