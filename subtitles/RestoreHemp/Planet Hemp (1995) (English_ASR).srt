1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:07,480
I'm Scott hogland this is planet hemp I

2
00:00:04,599 --> 00:00:09,759
sitting in a Mot and the Bible there on

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:11,359
the Shelf so I had a Satur to pick it up

4
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:15,199
and read a

5
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:18,160
verse well according to Genesis 1 verse

6
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:21,559
29 God gave every man every bearing a

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:24,359
seed which is on the earth plan I have

8
00:00:21,559 --> 00:00:26,278
which Bears a seed Ed me up in a jail

9
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:27,640
and they took my herb away and threw me

10
00:00:26,278 --> 00:00:30,320
in a

11
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:32,079
cage that makes me ask a question who

12
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,558
are throughout this program you will

13
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,920
learn how one of the world's oldest

14
00:00:33,558 --> 00:00:37,159
cultivated crops can play a major role

15
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,120
in dealing with some of today's

16
00:00:37,159 --> 00:00:41,000
environmental struggles as well as

17
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:43,079
increasing the wealth economy and

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,198
wellbeing of its

19
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:47,640
[Music]

20
00:00:45,198 --> 00:00:51,829
population together and tell them this

21
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:55,408
[ __ ] ain't right learn first and then

22
00:00:51,829 --> 00:00:55,408
[Music]

23
00:00:56,119 --> 00:01:03,238
decide allow me to introduce Dr Tom

24
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:04,719
Maloney hemp goes back a long ways for

25
00:01:03,238 --> 00:01:07,478
being used by

26
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:09,359
man Dr Maloney is the head of the wood

27
00:01:07,478 --> 00:01:12,000
materials and engineering department at

28
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:13,640
the Washington State University it is in

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,799
his Laboratories that he and his

30
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:18,159
associates test building products

31
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:20,680
manufactured from

32
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,840
hemp next I'd like you to meet Ken

33
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:25,439
fredman president of American hemp

34
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:28,079
mertile in Seattle Washington Ken

35
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:32,199
Imports and sells goods made from him

36
00:01:28,078 --> 00:01:34,879
including paper fabric food even

37
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:37,000
furniture and this is Paul Stanford

38
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:39,478
president of tree-free Eco paper in

39
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,640
Portland Oregon Paul sells the many

40
00:01:39,478 --> 00:01:43,560
paper products that can be made from him

41
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:46,879
from envelopes to letterhead to

42
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:49,159
corrugated boxes to computer paper well

43
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:52,239
our papers made from non-wood fiber

44
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:54,640
primarily hemp but first let's clear the

45
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:56,560
air of a few misconceptions hemp and

46
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:00,359
marijuana are often referred to as the

47
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:05,000
same substance but this is untrue

48
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:08,080
hemp is a plant that grows um over most

49
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,800
of the world it's Latin name is Cannabis

50
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:14,519
sativa it is the same plant that the

51
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:16,920
marijuana comes from but it's grown

52
00:02:14,519 --> 00:02:19,719
differently and they hybrid it so it's

53
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:22,238
very low in THC if you were to think of

54
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:25,080
an apple tree hemp would be the tree

55
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:27,878
itself the bark The Roots the stems the

56
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:29,560
leaves the whole tree marijuana would

57
00:02:27,878 --> 00:02:31,799
then be the fruit of the tree or the

58
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:35,319
Apple

59
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:39,360
hemp is a crop that grows annually it

60
00:02:35,318 --> 00:02:42,158
grows relatively rapidly uh depending on

61
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,040
location and Pacific Northwest from what

62
00:02:42,158 --> 00:02:46,840
I understand is a good location for

63
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:49,959
growing the hemp plant you can get a lot

64
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:52,680
of material growing annually you can

65
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:56,039
grow it on uh land that might not be

66
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:58,360
good for Forest uh perhaps the biggest

67
00:02:56,039 --> 00:03:00,479
hurdle tripping the hemp industry is the

68
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:04,080
mistaken idea that when when hemp is

69
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:06,679
grown marijuana is always

70
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,360
produced what a lot of people get

71
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:10,560
confused about what is hemp and what's

72
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:12,959
marijuana and I think another parts of

73
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,878
your program you're discussing that but

74
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,680
they're quite different I always tell

75
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:20,439
people I say well what is hemp I said

76
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:22,599
well just think about hemp rope that's

77
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:26,039
the hemp that you're really familiar

78
00:03:22,598 --> 00:03:28,878
with marijuana is only grown on female

79
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:31,429
plants if male plants are grown only

80
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:33,158
industry usable material is

81
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:35,879
[Music]

82
00:03:33,158 --> 00:03:38,318
produced besides growing only male

83
00:03:35,878 --> 00:03:40,959
plants science has created a genetic

84
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:43,000
hybrid that produces no marijuana

85
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,920
whatsoever or non-industrial hemp would

86
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,560
be illegal marijuana the things that's

87
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:49,039
being grown in people's basements are

88
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,239
imported from Thailand um Industrial

89
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:53,318
Hemp is a different hybrid it's grown

90
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:54,920
differently it's grown for the stock all

91
00:03:53,318 --> 00:03:56,280
the fibers come from the stock so they

92
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:59,878
grow it close together they don't grow

93
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:03,079
it for the leaves or the buds

94
00:03:59,878 --> 00:04:06,919
it's the same plant but uh the plant

95
00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:09,120
that produces the best and most fiber uh

96
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:12,119
doesn't produce the psychoactive

97
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,719
substance in any quantities that uh are

98
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:17,560
useful for drug production they've been

99
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:19,600
doing it for uh Generations in Western

100
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:22,319
Europe and for centuries in Eastern

101
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:25,040
Europe uh in fact in the United States

102
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:27,240
we had Industrial Hemp until 1937 and

103
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:30,560
scientists have dated hemp use back

104
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:32,918
12,000 years it is known to be one of

105
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,800
the first four cultivated

106
00:04:32,918 --> 00:04:37,399
crops 12,000 years ago hemp was one of

107
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:39,840
the first crops that was purposely

108
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:43,198
cultivated by human beings in the first

109
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:46,679
agricultural settlements that uh sprung

110
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:48,720
up in uh uh the tiger Euphrates valleys

111
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:51,759
and in the Yellow River

112
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,800
Valley sailing ships used hemp to make

113
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:56,759
the sail cloth and hemp's been used and

114
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:59,439
making paper for centuries and

115
00:04:56,759 --> 00:05:02,080
centuries this one plant was used to

116
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:05,079
make the paper that Bibles and even the

117
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:07,959
Declaration of Independence were printed

118
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:10,359
on hemp has been woven into garments

119
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:12,719
throughout history and across the world

120
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:15,840
Not only was the very first American

121
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:18,000
flag swn by Betsy Ross made from hemp

122
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:19,758
but so were the clothes and supplies of

123
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,199
the many soldiers that fought to keep

124
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,720
her

125
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,319
waving was illegal not to grow hemp and

126
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:27,440
some of the British colonies because

127
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:29,360
they needed it for their Sals and their

128
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:31,519
ropes and they needed enough of a

129
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:35,280
production to satisfy the

130
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:36,959
Navy but more recently in the 1940s when

131
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:39,079
the United States was at war in the

132
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:41,439
Pacific and many of our supplies were

133
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:44,719
cut off the United States government

134
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:47,120
produced a video called hemp for victory

135
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:50,280
this video was to encourage Farmers to

136
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:52,280
grow hemp for the war effort American

137
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:55,198
hemp must meet the needs of our Army and

138
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:57,359
Navy as well as of our Industries in

139
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,840
1942 patriotic farmers at the

140
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,879
government's request planted 36,000

141
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:05,918
Acres of seed hemp an increase of

142
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:08,639
several th% the goal for 1943 is 50,000

143
00:06:05,918 --> 00:06:08,639
Acres of seed

144
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:14,840
hemp today when grown for paper

145
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:17,720
production it would take four acres of

146
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:22,038
trees to make the same amount of usable

147
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:25,039
pulp material as one acre of hemp well

148
00:06:22,038 --> 00:06:28,839
hemp is the longest and strongest plant

149
00:06:25,038 --> 00:06:32,279
fiber so it can make a stronger paper

150
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:35,079
than uh wood fiber wood fiber's maximum

151
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:37,559
length is about 7 to 8 mm where hemp

152
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:39,598
fiber can be up to 3 m long or hundreds

153
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:43,680
of times

154
00:06:39,598 --> 00:06:47,159
longer that same one acre of hemp can be

155
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:50,560
harvested three times a year for hemp

156
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:53,479
only has a 120-day growing

157
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:56,720
season tree-free paper can be made with

158
00:06:53,478 --> 00:06:59,878
um any combination of hemp pulp from 10%

159
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:02,400
to 90% to 100% the paperwork currently

160
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:04,919
producing is 90% hemp 10%

161
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:06,878
cotton and it's um got the obvious

162
00:07:04,918 --> 00:07:08,598
advantages over a wood pulp because you

163
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:11,080
don't need to cut trees to make nice

164
00:07:08,598 --> 00:07:13,759
paper it's also stronger than W pulp it

165
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:16,800
can be recycled more times according to

166
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:19,319
USDA bulletin 404 a waste product from

167
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,400
making canvas rope lace and linen that

168
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:23,800
waste product makes more than four times

169
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:25,679
more paper than trees according to a

170
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:29,520
Dutch study that was published in last

171
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:31,560
July of 93's Pulp and Paper magazine the

172
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:34,318
the total production from hemp both the

173
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:38,199
bass fiber which can be made into both

174
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:40,639
paper and textiles plus the herd fiber

175
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:42,680
those fibers together produce more than

176
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,840
eight times more paper than the most

177
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:47,519
productive tree

178
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:50,638
species another advantage to hemp paper

179
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:53,198
over tree paper is that no harmful acids

180
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:55,879
are used in the bleaching process it can

181
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:57,680
be bleached with hydrogen peroxide um to

182
00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:59,639
avoid the chlorine problems from uh

183
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,560
paper industry

184
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:04,199
so it is an ideal product for paper it's

185
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:06,720
an annual plant it uh yields a lot of

186
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:09,199
Pulp and you can make paper with the

187
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,639
byproducts of the uh textile industry so

188
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,478
you can use all the plant and and make

189
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:15,840
each of them cheaper the pl all the

190
00:08:13,478 --> 00:08:18,719
plant

191
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:21,598
yeah hemp is composed of very long

192
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:24,120
fibers up to 15 ft in length and

193
00:08:21,598 --> 00:08:27,279
depending on how the hemp is grown these

194
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:30,439
fibers can be woven into fabric fabric

195
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:32,038
as soft as women's lingerie or as rough

196
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:35,599
as

197
00:08:32,038 --> 00:08:38,439
burlap uh again as you know hemp fiber

198
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:42,080
can be used uh in the United States and

199
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:43,760
is being used and cloth products uh the

200
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,800
Chinese are doing a better job right now

201
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:47,480
on the lighter weight Fabrics um they

202
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:49,799
are spinning finer threads that the

203
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:54,200
hungarians will are able to do and will

204
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:54,199
start doing in bigger quantities

205
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,839
immediately there are um probably

206
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,078
hundreds of products you could do from

207
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:03,839
him the ones we're currently doing are

208
00:09:02,078 --> 00:09:06,879
fabrics and almost everything you make

209
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:10,440
from fabric uh clothing bags

210
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:12,559
wallets uh hats things like that are all

211
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:15,279
being made currently futons it's a good

212
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:15,278
uh upholster

213
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:20,958
fabric fabric made from hemp is three

214
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:24,680
times stronger than cotton is more water

215
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:26,919
absorbent than cotton and is warmer than

216
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:28,239
cotton um it's a good alternative to

217
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:32,159
Cotton because it's grown without

218
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:34,720
pesticides it um stops soil erosion it's

219
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:36,759
uh pest resistant it's drought resistant

220
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,000
uh Cotton's a very

221
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:40,720
uh cotton has a lot of impact on the

222
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,879
environment it's grown with a lot of

223
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,440
pesticides there's some soil degreg

224
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:47,039
problems there's erosion problems

225
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:49,120
there's the the problems of harvesting

226
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:51,679
and things like that uh hemp is very

227
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,679
easy to grow um it's naturally resistant

228
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:55,759
to Pest and it's naturally resistant to

229
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:57,838
droughts and so you can grow it without

230
00:09:55,759 --> 00:10:01,120
putting new chemicals into the

231
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:04,120
environment visual if you can a house

232
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:07,480
made entirely of hemp start with the

233
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:10,159
foundation the concrete in France they

234
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:13,800
have perfected a technique where you mix

235
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:16,439
hemp herd with lime that substance then

236
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:20,479
mineralizes into a material that is

237
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:23,640
stronger lighter and more durable than

238
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:25,800
concrete as one of the numerous products

239
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:29,600
where the hemp material could go would

240
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:31,759
be into this product line either as on

241
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:35,120
top of our foundation lie the building

242
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:38,720
materials made from trees hemp has the

243
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,720
potential to replace these

244
00:10:39,278 --> 00:10:45,679
products long fiber is very intriguing

245
00:10:43,278 --> 00:10:48,278
to many people because you can take that

246
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:50,039
and make in the long structural pieces

247
00:10:48,278 --> 00:10:52,958
using that fiber because you got the

248
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:57,000
fiber length and the hemp fiber is very

249
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:59,319
strong and so well right now the demand

250
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,559
exceeds the supply and because of that

251
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:04,480
that's driven the price up in the long

252
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:06,838
term though when uh there aren't the

253
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:09,560
artificial barriers to the market that

254
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:12,079
exist today hemp fiber will be less

255
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:15,439
expensive within the walls of our house

256
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:17,799
we need Plumbing hemp can be made into a

257
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,279
biodegradable substitute for plastic

258
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:23,199
Plumbing

259
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:26,240
pipes and here's a sample of a a hemp

260
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:29,480
board uh there's some others here too I

261
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:31,320
I'm hold holding up one as uh it

262
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:33,759
something like what I just showed not

263
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:36,399
quite the same because some of this has

264
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:37,679
to be worked out yet exactly how to work

265
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,958
with these materials some of the

266
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:42,120
Machinery isn't quite right but that's

267
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:44,399
because we've been using wood machinery

268
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:47,560
and not hemp

269
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:50,799
Machinery now this board is not as good

270
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:52,719
as this one over here uh this is again

271
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:55,838
you probably can't see it on the camera

272
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:58,560
but it's it has a nicer surface uh it

273
00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:00,399
looks better and I know the numbers

274
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:03,000
aren't on the back here but I do know

275
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:05,679
it's much stronger in this in fact it's

276
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,958
much stronger than the the traditional

277
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:11,159
MDF or Med best fiber board I just

278
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:13,319
showed you in a house fire people are

279
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:16,319
often killed by the gases from their

280
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:18,120
carpet as it burns hemp carpet releases

281
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:22,320
no poisonous

282
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:25,159
fumes this could be uh around doors

283
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:27,560
windows what have you where we use high

284
00:12:25,159 --> 00:12:29,319
quality Lumber in the past which we

285
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:32,039
really don't have much of anymore no

286
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:33,839
matter what anybody says as long as this

287
00:12:32,039 --> 00:12:35,480
is painted you would never know the

288
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:37,880
difference between this being a nice

289
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:40,639
Mill piece of Douglas for Oak what have

290
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:42,958
you if you want to have a wood grain you

291
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:45,680
can print it on overlay it and what have

292
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:47,399
you a lot of this is done already so

293
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:49,479
it's moving into a lot of the

294
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:52,799
traditional uses that where we used to

295
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:56,600
have Lumber oil from the hemp seed can

296
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:56,599
even be used to make paints and

297
00:12:57,159 --> 00:13:01,879
varnishes it works in there it has

298
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:03,879
worked elsewhere it's been used some in

299
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:06,919
this country in the past but there is

300
00:13:03,879 --> 00:13:09,399
the possibility of making this kind of

301
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:11,159
product with the fiber as well there's

302
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:14,559
all kinds of mixtures too you could use

303
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:17,240
a good long hemp fiber on the surfaces

304
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:19,559
and some poor fiber or particle in the

305
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:21,198
middle because it's for bending purposes

306
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:23,159
and the fiber gives you the bending

307
00:13:21,198 --> 00:13:24,759
property so there's all kinds of

308
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:26,559
opportunities it's going to boil down to

309
00:13:24,759 --> 00:13:28,399
economics like all of these things how

310
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:31,518
much does it cost to do it how much does

311
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:35,360
it cost to grow the material Harvest it

312
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:37,198
process it um and supply and demands in

313
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,199
there too if you don't have the wood

314
00:13:37,198 --> 00:13:41,120
material if you want to keep making

315
00:13:39,198 --> 00:13:43,319
these kind of products you use something

316
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,560
else all of us want it to happen as soon

317
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:46,399
as possible we could for the American

318
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:48,198
farmers and be good for the environment

319
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:51,159
be good for the consumer we get cheaper

320
00:13:48,198 --> 00:13:53,919
hemp products here um very

321
00:13:51,159 --> 00:13:56,799
quickly the same process by which we

322
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:59,639
make ethanol fuel from corn can be used

323
00:13:56,799 --> 00:14:03,439
to convert hemp into a usable

324
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:05,320
gas for our cars and to heat our houses

325
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,120
there's a process which you can make uh

326
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:09,160
the same way you make ethanol from corn

327
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,759
you can make it out of hemp uh very

328
00:14:09,159 --> 00:14:14,600
economically I think you can also make a

329
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:17,320
hemp seed oil can be used as a fuel

330
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:20,159
probably this would mean less dependency

331
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:22,600
on any foreign oils and would reduce the

332
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:26,480
price of gasoline in this

333
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:29,159
country but what about food hemp seeds

334
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:32,399
contain all the necessary and essential

335
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:35,679
fatty acids amino acids and protein

336
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:37,399
necessary for human life you can use it

337
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:40,039
as a cooking additive you can use the

338
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:42,879
hemp seeds themselves in cooking uh you

339
00:14:40,039 --> 00:14:44,879
can cook in the oil it's it's very and

340
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:47,399
such a variety of foods can be made with

341
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:50,480
the hemp seed anything from hemp ice

342
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:52,679
cream to hemp peanut butter all of which

343
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:55,278
Aid in increasing the body's immune

344
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:57,519
system and actually remove

345
00:14:55,278 --> 00:15:00,278
life-threatening plaque from Our

346
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:03,360
arteries it's very high in the essential

347
00:15:00,278 --> 00:15:05,360
fatty acids uh high in protein low in

348
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,079
the bad kind of cholesterol high in the

349
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,079
good kind of cholesterol it's a it's

350
00:15:07,078 --> 00:15:12,000
like flax seed oil as far as all the

351
00:15:09,078 --> 00:15:14,599
health benefits just as it has done in

352
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,078
the past the potential is there for hemp

353
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:18,639
food to play a key role in ending our

354
00:15:17,078 --> 00:15:20,838
world's hunger

355
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:23,560
problem probably everything can cure

356
00:15:20,839 --> 00:15:26,759
world hunger if you do it right um it

357
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:28,758
could be part of the solution certainly

358
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:30,519
and it's it's a plant that you can grow

359
00:15:28,759 --> 00:15:32,639
and and and be good for the environment

360
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:36,240
at the same time feed people it's high

361
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:38,839
protein um it would contribute to the

362
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:41,440
solution so what climate conditions are

363
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:44,519
good for growing hemp well hemp is

364
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:46,920
indigenous to central Asian region area

365
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:51,519
kazakistan

366
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:53,919
uh Pakistan the Tibetan region of China

367
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:57,240
and Kashmir region of

368
00:15:53,919 --> 00:16:00,719
India hemp is like a weed it can grow

369
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:03,278
virtually anywhere in us any soil well

370
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:05,519
there are two main sources of hemp in

371
00:16:03,278 --> 00:16:08,120
the US market right now uh Hungarian

372
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:10,759
hemp and Chinese hemp well it's grown in

373
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:13,318
Holland it was made legal to grow in

374
00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:15,919
England I believe in June of this year

375
00:16:13,318 --> 00:16:19,360
and there's some hemp farms in Canada at

376
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:21,479
the present time hemp can be planted in

377
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:24,959
areas that have been deforested or

378
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:27,680
Fallen victim to a fire you can grow it

379
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:30,879
on uh land that might not be good for

380
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:33,439
Forest uh stand so somewhere some parts

381
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:35,318
here in Eastern Washington where it's

382
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:39,199
not particularly great for growing

383
00:16:35,318 --> 00:16:41,838
anything H hemp crop would grow well its

384
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:44,318
long roots anchor the soil in place to

385
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:47,000
prevent erosion and its nutrient-rich

386
00:16:44,318 --> 00:16:48,958
foliage mixes with the soil to actually

387
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,639
increase the fertility for the coming

388
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:53,599
years this is why hemp is also a good

389
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:55,799
rotation crop for

390
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,360
Farmers judging from the exceptions our

391
00:16:55,799 --> 00:16:59,559
products have gotten I'm pretty sure the

392
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,480
general public would not have any

393
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:03,239
objection or very little objection to

394
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,798
Industrial H being grown here the

395
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:07,359
politicians don't realize that nobody

396
00:17:04,798 --> 00:17:08,759
even wants to talk about it yet um but

397
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,359
with the environmental issues becoming

398
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:11,838
more crucial with the American farmers

399
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:14,318
needing new crops with the paper

400
00:17:11,838 --> 00:17:17,038
industry needing new pulp it should

401
00:17:14,318 --> 00:17:20,159
happen very quickly the idea behind the

402
00:17:17,038 --> 00:17:23,160
hemp movement is not to eliminate jobs

403
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:26,120
or eliminate Industries it is to create

404
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:28,439
more jobs and new Industries to

405
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:30,918
integrate hemp knowledge and hemp

406
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:34,120
products into today's society The

407
00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:36,919
Logical way to use this to start with is

408
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:39,879
as a supplement to present wood material

409
00:17:36,919 --> 00:17:42,120
in an operating medium NY fiber board

410
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:44,360
plan like I showed here or particle

411
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:47,719
board uh which is a little coarser

412
00:17:44,359 --> 00:17:50,879
particle as a a supplement to that raw

413
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:53,798
material and uh so people become

414
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:57,039
familiar with the processing uh of the

415
00:17:53,798 --> 00:17:58,879
material and it gets uh used properly on

416
00:17:57,038 --> 00:18:02,839
the board and then eventually with

417
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:05,240
success you could move on to a uh a

418
00:18:02,839 --> 00:18:06,918
manufacturing plant that would use the

419
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:09,440
hemp material

420
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:11,360
exclusively um I'm not optimistic it

421
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,080
might be 5 or 10 years before they allow

422
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:15,119
it and what we're trying to do is put

423
00:18:13,079 --> 00:18:17,399
the hemp products under the nose of the

424
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:20,519
American consumers so they can see it's

425
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:23,400
a good product um and not be afraid of

426
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:25,158
it and start uh accepting it and

427
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:28,320
accepting the idea of growing it

428
00:18:25,159 --> 00:18:32,240
here support your local hemp industry

429
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:34,759
Buy products see for yourself test them

430
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:38,558
against products that you use now which

431
00:18:34,759 --> 00:18:41,200
do you like better then make a

432
00:18:38,558 --> 00:18:43,440
choice it would appear that it has lots

433
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:46,038
of benefits and a lot of good things

434
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:49,038
that you can do with it and the secret

435
00:18:46,038 --> 00:18:51,879
is economics like I said before and

436
00:18:49,038 --> 00:18:54,519
developing a way uh to take it out of

437
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:56,200
the political and emotional scene so

438
00:18:54,519 --> 00:18:58,079
that there's there's not a concern that

439
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:00,200
this you're growing a drug material

440
00:18:58,079 --> 00:19:03,639
rather than ability

441
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:04,960
material but um it's just a question on

442
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:08,240
how much political resistance there's

443
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:10,360
going to be uh it could happen within

444
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,558
one year of them of the United States

445
00:19:10,359 --> 00:19:15,639
government allowing it it might happen

446
00:19:12,558 --> 00:19:17,879
sooner um under a permit

447
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:19,720
plan and I I think what's going to

448
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:22,760
happen is that cannabis will be taxed

449
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:27,480
and regulated and that hemp fiber and

450
00:19:22,759 --> 00:19:31,200
Seed will be grown uh without regulation

451
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:36,000
and uh then 10 years will become a major

452
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:39,798
source of fiber for uh paper

453
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:44,440
making I'm Scott hogland this is planet

454
00:19:39,798 --> 00:19:44,440
hemp think about it
