1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,960
um my other organization is a vote

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,400
victory over the enemy hey i like which

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,719
is the unregistered voter in the state

4
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,638
of california oh okay what we have to do

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,240
is upgrade our standard of voting we can

6
00:00:10,638 --> 00:00:14,879
send people to the moon and we're

7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,800
sending satellites into outer space

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,118
i believe that our system of voting in

9
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,359
this country is very uh adequate very

10
00:00:19,118 --> 00:00:22,879
old it needs to be renewed and revised

11
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,640
and updated

12
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:27,038
i think that the vote voting should be

13
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,960
more important than christmas

14
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,960
okay i think that we should spend a lot

15
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,880
of money on educating the people look at

16
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,880
it this way the government

17
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,320
is in favor of the united states public

18
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,200
to vote

19
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:41,600
i feel that it's our duty to show them

20
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,120
or to find a way to help the government

21
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,039
find ways

22
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:46,718
to help people vote and i think with

23
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:48,238
television

24
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,558
the telephone

25
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:51,919
computer optics

26
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:54,000
and

27
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,600
and satellite dishes and all this

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,119
technology that we've got we should be

29
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,960
able to sit home

30
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:00,320
and vote on all these important issues

31
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,558
and i'm sure the government wants

32
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,478
everybody to vote

33
00:01:02,558 --> 00:01:06,399
it's uh it's our constitutional right

34
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:08,000
and they and they stand behind it i

35
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,840
think that they should get behind us and

36
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,159
help us to get out there

37
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,159
and make voting a very important issue

38
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:15,840
it is important even if you are not in

39
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,680
favor of say the california marijuana

40
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,040
initiative of the hemp initiative

41
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,560
that's fine we would love for you to

42
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,560
come out and speak your opinion we want

43
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,560
you out there voting we want you to take

44
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,320
an active part in this country

45
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,879
if you do then i think this will solve

46
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:28,879
the problem
