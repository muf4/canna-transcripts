1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,928
let's just say I don't know what I

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:05,700
organized but I was part of a lot of

3
00:00:03,928 --> 00:00:10,138
things that went along yeah right and

4
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:12,449
that's really kind of the reality of it

5
00:00:10,138 --> 00:00:16,048
just wandered around to different places

6
00:00:12,449 --> 00:00:20,219
worth it it was good to wander too yeah

7
00:00:16,048 --> 00:00:21,868
so you are now a recording artist and

8
00:00:20,219 --> 00:00:24,000
you have a number of albums out there I

9
00:00:21,868 --> 00:00:27,059
guess was it Jackson Browne who first

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:32,489
brought you into the studio how did that

11
00:00:27,059 --> 00:00:34,229
come about well it came about you know I

12
00:00:32,488 --> 00:00:37,709
spent a lot of time as a political

13
00:00:34,229 --> 00:00:41,209
activist right and then for me as an

14
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:44,878
individual I came to understand that

15
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:47,670
that wasn't that identity didn't work

16
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:49,738
for me mm-hmm right because it limited

17
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:52,109
my perception of reality because I was

18
00:00:49,738 --> 00:00:53,279
person I was participating in reality

19
00:00:52,109 --> 00:00:56,250
from the perception of a political

20
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,920
activist and no matter how righteous my

21
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:01,109
activism it what no matter how righteous

22
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,550
might cause I'm limiting my ability to

23
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:05,969
see because I'm only seeing as a

24
00:01:02,549 --> 00:01:07,859
political activist and and that has its

25
00:01:05,969 --> 00:01:09,868
own limitations because I think there

26
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:13,349
are larger understandings that as human

27
00:01:09,868 --> 00:01:17,069
beings we need to be able to experience

28
00:01:13,349 --> 00:01:18,449
maybe alright so in that hole as all

29
00:01:17,069 --> 00:01:21,149
that's going on through my head and

30
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:26,210
consciousness I started writing and and

31
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:29,130
and I started writing and in yes Jackson

32
00:01:26,209 --> 00:01:31,949
took me and I was kind of like a

33
00:01:29,129 --> 00:01:33,929
fugitive and and Jackson took me in and

34
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:35,640
into the world of music while I was

35
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:37,890
writing and then at some point I got the

36
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:40,618
idea while I want to put what I want to

37
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:43,920
put my lines with music but as spoken

38
00:01:40,618 --> 00:01:45,569
word mm-hmm you know so then I wandered

39
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,549
off into that to see what it would go

40
00:01:45,569 --> 00:01:49,500
and Here I am i remember it was must

41
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:52,159
been more than 20 years ago i first came

42
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:55,228
across a cassette of yours it was this

43
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:57,509
is an El Salvador cases in El Salvador

44
00:01:55,228 --> 00:01:59,539
right that was really a powerful was

45
00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:03,420
that one of your first ones it was the

46
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:06,090
fourth album fourth album we made tribal

47
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:09,538
voice which was the poetry with the

48
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:11,700
tribal music uh-huh and then three years

49
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:13,379
passed and then I met Jesse at Davis and

50
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:15,629
with Jesse had Davis made

51
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:17,849
graffiti make a graffiti man which is

52
00:02:15,629 --> 00:02:19,500
now with the electric music right and

53
00:02:17,849 --> 00:02:22,439
then we made heart jump bouquet and then

54
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:25,740
we made but this is nel Salvador I think

55
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:28,229
in 1987 were recorded that right we like

56
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:34,110
that Thun grass fire man that's why ya

57
00:02:28,229 --> 00:02:37,199
na needs tiene mas jay-z well it's

58
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:39,120
reality yeah real so many things I

59
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:41,399
Messiah was backing that up more and

60
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:44,939
more every day we often talk about it

61
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:48,240
here how you know just in what was it 93

62
00:02:44,939 --> 00:02:50,280
they discovered that our bodies had this

63
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:52,830
whole endogenous cannabinoid system

64
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:55,169
where we have these artificial

65
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:57,840
cannabinoids they kind of modulate the

66
00:02:55,169 --> 00:03:00,839
rest of the endocrine system the body's

67
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:03,270
hormones and everything's what you do

68
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:06,450
need th see ya know that mother's milk

69
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:09,540
has endogenous th don't know that's why

70
00:03:06,449 --> 00:03:12,689
my DNA needs th there's a reason right

71
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:14,549
then it gets said but you know what I'm

72
00:03:12,689 --> 00:03:16,129
interested in I mean in a way is like

73
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:21,000
because what you're saying about the

74
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:23,370
this yeah I think that where's this

75
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,469
cannabis sense yeah canvas Congress I'll

76
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:27,090
see what makes cannabis common sense to

77
00:03:25,469 --> 00:03:28,800
me is I think we really need to start

78
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:31,110
putting some efforts in to the

79
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:34,469
legalization of industrial hemp mm-hmm

80
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:36,390
if we put as much effort in energy into

81
00:03:34,469 --> 00:03:40,379
the legalization of industrial hemp as

82
00:03:36,389 --> 00:03:43,199
we put into hemp that we can smoke if we

83
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:45,479
put an equal amount of energy into that

84
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:47,369
because that serves and it meets a

85
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:50,159
larger objective of alternative energy

86
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:52,020
because I mean wow you know like us we

87
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:55,020
make the fuels and the food and all the

88
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:57,420
sir all right in it you know and I and

89
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:59,790
I've had this lingering curiosity in the

90
00:03:57,419 --> 00:04:01,679
back of my consciousness as active as

91
00:03:59,789 --> 00:04:06,269
the cannabis movement is in its various

92
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:11,069
levels and perceptions right that III

93
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:13,980
don't quite get why more energy isn't

94
00:04:11,069 --> 00:04:15,509
put into that mm-hmm you know because it

95
00:04:13,979 --> 00:04:17,009
would save the farmers and all I mean

96
00:04:15,509 --> 00:04:18,959
there's so much that could be and

97
00:04:17,009 --> 00:04:20,310
everybody's talk see and and people are

98
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,629
starting to sit back now that the

99
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:24,060
political system starting to talk about

100
00:04:21,629 --> 00:04:25,769
well in order to meet our oil needs in

101
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,670
order to meet all these will do offshore

102
00:04:25,769 --> 00:04:29,879
drilling

103
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:31,290
you know and people say and but and I

104
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:33,810
don't see it coming on in order to meet

105
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:36,600
some of these energy needs industrial

106
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:40,350
hemp yeah we often talk about this study

107
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:42,060
out of Notre Dame University in 1975 is

108
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:45,689
published in a magazine called the

109
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:47,730
Midlands naturalist and it's feral hemp

110
00:04:45,689 --> 00:04:50,399
in southern Illinois according to that

111
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:53,100
study an acre of hemp will make four

112
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:55,679
tons of hemp seed and four times as hemp

113
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:59,070
seed will make 300 gallons of biodiesel

114
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:01,860
fuel or oil so to me those of us who

115
00:04:59,069 --> 00:05:03,930
come from the hemp community say this

116
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:06,960
should be the alternative form of energy

117
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:09,360
that we're putting up it out put as much

118
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:11,519
effort into to getting medicine for the

119
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,790
earth as we put into getting it for

120
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:16,560
ourselves see we have the energy to do

121
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:18,930
it it's just it up to focus in the

122
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,300
consciousness because what I see as the

123
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:23,790
imbalance we're talking about the

124
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:27,030
benefits of him or marijuana should

125
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:28,920
additionally all right for us but it but

126
00:05:27,029 --> 00:05:32,129
it also serves the same medicinal

127
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:33,900
benefit for the earth you know and it

128
00:05:32,129 --> 00:05:37,740
does but we're not putting an equal

129
00:05:33,899 --> 00:05:39,569
effort into what it does for uh for the

130
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:46,199
earth as we're putting in to what it

131
00:05:39,569 --> 00:05:50,639
does for us and because what I don't see

132
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:52,079
it really happening in anywhere to a

133
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,729
large degree but what we really need to

134
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:56,759
have is we really need to have a

135
00:05:53,730 --> 00:06:00,629
stimulation of the inner of the energy

136
00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:04,079
consciousness energy John our theme was

137
00:06:00,629 --> 00:06:06,300
industrial have man we yes the antenna

138
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:08,550
should be yeah stream of energy the

139
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:10,319
environmental crisis being what it is I

140
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:14,000
think it's a neck I think there's an

141
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:16,259
opening somewhere to inject it in as a

142
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,250
alternative part of the alternative

143
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:19,709
because they're talking about

144
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:21,089
alternative energy yeah I can read and

145
00:06:19,709 --> 00:06:23,279
write a sheep and everybody i think

146
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:25,409
that's about right it's the alternative

147
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:28,949
energy i agree with right well that's

148
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:31,170
all going on this whole idea and maybe

149
00:06:28,949 --> 00:06:32,879
it comes out of our consciousness about

150
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:35,850
saying no consider this this is about

151
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:37,259
alternative energy mm-hmm you know

152
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:40,020
because they are talking about drilling

153
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:40,649
offshore no you know and everybody's

154
00:06:40,019 --> 00:06:43,109
starting to eat

155
00:06:40,649 --> 00:06:45,029
up to people that wouldn't accept it 15

156
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:48,150
years ago it's it's you know because

157
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:49,978
what's happened is the industrial ruling

158
00:06:48,149 --> 00:06:52,679
class they're cutting off access to the

159
00:06:49,978 --> 00:06:54,180
drug oil and people are going through

160
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,620
the withdrawal and they're making them

161
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:57,150
pay the higher price and now they're

162
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:59,100
willing to sell their children so to

163
00:06:57,149 --> 00:07:00,629
speak or chelle would sell the family

164
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:02,280
jewels so to speak you know writing to

165
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:05,038
get the next fix the offshore drilling

166
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:07,589
ET boon pin all as Ardoin transfer well

167
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:10,259
it always you must know and but I I

168
00:07:07,589 --> 00:07:12,149
think that see what makes sense makes

169
00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:13,800
sense what Alec cannabis come what makes

170
00:07:12,149 --> 00:07:16,079
sense makes sense and I think that it

171
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:18,569
that you see I'm not the person that

172
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:21,569
does but that can that does it but

173
00:07:18,569 --> 00:07:24,389
someone usually if it started gets

174
00:07:21,569 --> 00:07:25,978
injected if in our consciousness and we

175
00:07:24,389 --> 00:07:27,840
start thinking away that this should be

176
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:30,599
put to that alternative energy debate

177
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:33,089
thing that's going on and I industrial

178
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:34,590
industrial him they don't want that but

179
00:07:33,089 --> 00:07:36,689
I don't think that's the key and it's

180
00:07:34,589 --> 00:07:37,709
being said for this for the sake of it

181
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:40,439
because you know there are a lot of

182
00:07:37,709 --> 00:07:42,209
people especially farmers the song about

183
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:45,329
fun there's a lot of fun there's a lot

184
00:07:42,209 --> 00:07:46,769
of people that would be supportive of it

185
00:07:45,329 --> 00:07:49,109
but it's got to be if we could put the

186
00:07:46,769 --> 00:07:50,310
money for these Detroit a and money

187
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:52,410
that's going over say it's an

188
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:54,089
arbitrator's pockets but putting in

189
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:57,060
finally you're gonna say I need to put

190
00:07:54,089 --> 00:07:59,698
the energy into the idea all right put

191
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:02,069
the energy in all right and then that'll

192
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:04,080
help to feed other energy and see what's

193
00:08:02,069 --> 00:08:05,699
going on is the word sorry for energy

194
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:07,680
against dust and we're putting against

195
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:09,120
them yeah that's exactly what's going on

196
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,470
they're putting their their energies

197
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,149
more coherent what they're going to do

198
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:13,949
against us there they're very coherent

199
00:08:12,149 --> 00:08:15,810
about what they're doing alright in

200
00:08:13,949 --> 00:08:18,900
order to keep the downtrodden the Donald

201
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:20,639
down try but it's about energies laws

202
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:22,319
and voting and all that stuff these are

203
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:25,530
mechanisms but in the end it's about

204
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:27,060
energy so the only defense we're ever

205
00:08:25,529 --> 00:08:29,668
going to really have in the long run

206
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:31,319
what kind of energy do we create with

207
00:08:29,668 --> 00:08:33,000
the creative power of our intelligence

208
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:37,649
what kind of coherent energy do we

209
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:40,200
protect ourselves with yeah because and

210
00:08:37,649 --> 00:08:43,139
anyway so to meet you handle it family I

211
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:45,690
think it's in our best interest if we

212
00:08:43,139 --> 00:08:48,389
really put thought into the industrial

213
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:52,850
what we call industrial hemp as a part

214
00:08:48,389 --> 00:08:52,850
of the alternative energy right

215
00:08:52,889 --> 00:08:57,989
consciousness that's going on right now

216
00:08:54,778 --> 00:08:59,879
right and then it helps the medical

217
00:08:57,989 --> 00:09:02,489
marijuana use for the humans and it also

218
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:04,499
helped for that yeah you can feel the

219
00:09:02,489 --> 00:09:06,350
plan got me good because I I think in a

220
00:09:04,499 --> 00:09:09,209
lot of ways we're having a hard time

221
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:10,678
getting past because the way we have to

222
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:12,588
fight the struggles we have to fight to

223
00:09:10,678 --> 00:09:16,918
get it legalized for human consumption

224
00:09:12,589 --> 00:09:18,569
all right i think but i just think an

225
00:09:16,918 --> 00:09:22,409
equal amount of energy needs to start

226
00:09:18,568 --> 00:09:24,298
going for its earth medicine protects

227
00:09:22,409 --> 00:09:27,358
you you know you don't have to but you

228
00:09:24,298 --> 00:09:29,548
don't have to insecticide it and all

229
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:32,269
that stuff right yeah that's right it

230
00:09:29,548 --> 00:09:34,499
grows more Buffalo in faster more

231
00:09:32,269 --> 00:09:35,999
protein fiber and oil than any other

232
00:09:34,499 --> 00:09:38,069
planet planet one of the things we say

233
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:40,168
here on the show quite frequently is

234
00:09:38,068 --> 00:09:42,269
that the real reason that marijuana's

235
00:09:40,168 --> 00:09:44,850
illegal has nothing to do with drugs

236
00:09:42,269 --> 00:09:47,188
it's not about drugs it's really about

237
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:49,829
money and the continued centralization

238
00:09:47,188 --> 00:09:52,738
of economic and political control it's

239
00:09:49,828 --> 00:09:54,808
about the political powers that be that

240
00:09:52,739 --> 00:09:58,100
protect the petrochemical industry and

241
00:09:54,808 --> 00:10:01,948
the wood based paper industry that whole

242
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:04,558
corporate monolith that wants to you

243
00:10:01,948 --> 00:10:08,399
know centralized control to a tinier and

244
00:10:04,558 --> 00:10:10,019
smaller group of people and we don't

245
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,178
even have to centralized control things

246
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:14,188
are working just great for them yeah and

247
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:16,379
they have been for a long time that was

248
00:10:14,188 --> 00:10:18,269
easy so so they don't need to centralize

249
00:10:16,379 --> 00:10:19,798
or do any I've actually all they're

250
00:10:18,269 --> 00:10:21,298
really leave all hit ball bearing

251
00:10:19,798 --> 00:10:23,909
institutions are concerned about is

252
00:10:21,298 --> 00:10:26,188
keeping the status quo yeah I don't

253
00:10:23,909 --> 00:10:27,659
think they're actively at this point I

254
00:10:26,188 --> 00:10:30,719
think they've got everything where they

255
00:10:27,659 --> 00:10:32,068
want it and it's working just fine I saw

256
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,959
a great bumper sticker the other day it

257
00:10:32,068 --> 00:10:36,288
said everything considered the war in

258
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:40,078
the environment is going extremely well

259
00:10:36,288 --> 00:10:43,470
yeah that's right we good it but for you

260
00:10:40,078 --> 00:10:47,519
this other thing about its marijuana is

261
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:49,769
not a drug all right and and we jokingly

262
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:52,589
refer to it I do we do sacrifice right

263
00:10:49,769 --> 00:10:55,198
no it's a plant the nerve it's an herb

264
00:10:52,589 --> 00:10:58,350
it's a plant it's not a drug the earth

265
00:10:55,198 --> 00:11:02,289
does not grow drugs this is basic

266
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:06,129
reality the earth does not grow drugs

267
00:11:02,289 --> 00:11:09,819
all right a man creates drugs out of

268
00:11:06,129 --> 00:11:15,278
things the earth grows so marijuana is

269
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:16,750
not a drug no its plant and and and I

270
00:11:15,278 --> 00:11:19,899
think that that's an important

271
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:21,909
distinction that we we need to

272
00:11:19,899 --> 00:11:23,409
understand because it's a part of our

273
00:11:21,909 --> 00:11:25,419
humor and a whole part of our

274
00:11:23,409 --> 00:11:26,919
consciousness is dope this is right you

275
00:11:25,419 --> 00:11:29,500
know it's kind of different but in

276
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:31,419
reality than agree we might look at the

277
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:33,669
like the Cheech and Chong kind of humor

278
00:11:31,419 --> 00:11:35,559
not to complain about them but it is

279
00:11:33,669 --> 00:11:38,559
self danica but but at some point we

280
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:41,258
need to really have that understanding

281
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:45,578
also because it helps us you know

282
00:11:41,259 --> 00:11:48,159
because we know the marijuana

283
00:11:45,578 --> 00:11:50,769
prohibition has got to do with the

284
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:55,139
threat that opposes to the petrotech the

285
00:11:50,769 --> 00:11:57,190
petro chemical society yeah you know

286
00:11:55,139 --> 00:11:58,899
because if you do experience all of

287
00:11:57,190 --> 00:12:02,079
these things out of it you don't need

288
00:11:58,899 --> 00:12:03,669
all this oil if you can you know if you

289
00:12:02,078 --> 00:12:05,500
can make paper out of it then you don't

290
00:12:03,669 --> 00:12:07,389
need to cut down the forest if you can

291
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:10,990
make wood for houses then you don't need

292
00:12:07,389 --> 00:12:13,180
see it's it's a serious see that's what

293
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:15,579
this is really all to the whole industry

294
00:12:13,179 --> 00:12:18,099
all about that whether you smoke a joint

295
00:12:15,578 --> 00:12:20,739
or I smoke a joint is it irrelevant it's

296
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:22,209
about this all right and whether we

297
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,940
smoke get to smoke a joint or not

298
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:27,458
becomes a way of keeping this down

299
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:30,190
mm-hmm we're fighting this thing right

300
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:31,838
you know an artificial construct and I'm

301
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:33,880
just saying somewhere along the line is

302
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:36,130
we evolve this thing if we throw in with

303
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:38,708
throwing our energy of consciousness and

304
00:12:36,129 --> 00:12:40,629
alliance with in what I call industrial

305
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:43,479
hemp looking out for the earth in a

306
00:12:40,629 --> 00:12:46,528
larger context it will be beneficial all

307
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,528
around for all of us
