1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:06,859
we got a very much of a Latin crowd

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:06,859
[Music]

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:13,599
here okay all right all right we got

4
00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:16,118
some here well here's the deal here's

5
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:18,240
the deal you know here we are in Seattle

6
00:00:16,118 --> 00:00:22,160
in Washington you know we know we have

7
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:24,239
17 States 17 medical states in America

8
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:27,518
the United States anyway this part of

9
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:29,719
America that are medical States but what

10
00:00:27,518 --> 00:00:32,679
I'm here to talk about is the rest of

11
00:00:29,719 --> 00:00:35,719
the world there's so much going on

12
00:00:32,679 --> 00:00:37,799
everywhere else not just America and the

13
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:40,039
one thing we all got in common with all

14
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:43,679
those guys everywhere else in the world

15
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:46,399
is we love one thing cannabis cannabis

16
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:50,280
yeah cannabis and we got one goal

17
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:53,399
between us all and that is to make

18
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:55,160
cannabis legal let cannabis be free and

19
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:58,359
that's it that's what brings us all

20
00:00:55,159 --> 00:01:00,919
together because for example in Spain

21
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:04,000
where I live most of the time you can

22
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:06,320
have uh uh four plants six plants

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,280
whatever it's not really uh secure

24
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:09,839
exactly the number of plants you can but

25
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,840
it's written into the

26
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,200
Constitution that you can grow cannabis

27
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,640
I think that's a good thing you know

28
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:19,040
that's why I live there okay and then in

29
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,759
Austria you know Austria where Vienna is

30
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,159
you know you think that one uh Little

31
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:25,719
Country in the middle of nowhere out up

32
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:26,920
next to Hungary well you can grow clones

33
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:29,359
there I mean one of my good friends

34
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:31,759
grows 10,000 clones a week and he's got

35
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:36,118
one of the any uh clone stores there

36
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:38,719
yeah 100% legal 100% legal and in

37
00:01:36,118 --> 00:01:41,680
Switzerland things were going 100% legal

38
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:43,640
to grow cannabis uh God for years for

39
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,439
years we used to grow Fields Fields

40
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:49,280
literally Fields 10 10 acres uh they

41
00:01:46,438 --> 00:01:51,438
call them hias there but uh you know

42
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:54,560
lots of for about a period of about 10

43
00:01:51,438 --> 00:01:56,599
years but now it's completely legal to

44
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,200
grow four plants in Switzerland so they

45
00:01:56,599 --> 00:02:01,759
kind of went backwards but you know I

46
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:04,200
I'm just talking about serious legal

47
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:07,079
growing and then the Czech Republic

48
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:09,920
remember it used to be uh Czechoslovakia

49
00:02:07,078 --> 00:02:11,799
and the part of it was a Czech Republic

50
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:14,159
it's legal to grow there too and by the

51
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:17,879
way cannabis is

52
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:21,799
decriminalized um Israel Israel any any

53
00:02:17,878 --> 00:02:25,359
Jewish people here Israelis yeah yeah

54
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:27,000
okay this is good this is good Israel is

55
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:30,000
one of the best places for growing

56
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,680
medical cannabis in the world Israel you

57
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,878
wouldn't think of it of course we all

58
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:37,080
know that Dr rapael mulam a Jewish

59
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:39,598
fellow Israeli he was the one that

60
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:43,319
discovered THC and he also discovered

61
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:45,199
the cannaboid uh receptors in Russia my

62
00:02:43,318 --> 00:02:47,479
first book is now coming out in Russia

63
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:49,878
it's on the boat right now coming from

64
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:52,518
China to America so we can ship it to

65
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:54,518
Russia um anyway it's still illegal in

66
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:57,560
Russia but they're growing all over the

67
00:02:54,519 --> 00:03:00,360
place Argentina this this winter I go I

68
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:04,598

69
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:08,480
Chile Peru or not no no Peru uh paray

70
00:03:04,598 --> 00:03:10,959
urugai and Brazil and all three of those

71
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:12,959
well everywhere but Brazil cannabis is

72
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:15,680
legal it's decriminalized now you can

73
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:19,039
have up to uh 20 gram that's 2/3 of an

74
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:21,239
ounce so and then even in in Mexico

75
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:24,959
where I went to school it's uh you can

76
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:29,000
have five GRS legal so the one thing we

77
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:32,199
got all in common is is this cannabis

78
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,239
and these guys in the other countries

79
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:36,719
have done a better job of legalization

80
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:38,920
than we have and we're leaders here in

81
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:40,840
America we've already shown I don't know

82
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:43,318
if any of you guys ever see my uh 10

83
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:47,360
pound plant video it's on YouTube just

84
00:03:43,318 --> 00:03:49,518
type in hantes in YouTube you see that

85
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,280
uh you see this big video of 10 pound

86
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,360
plants we already teach everybody how to

87
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,719
grow 10 pound plants and so they're

88
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,920
looking for some leadership from us

89
00:03:55,719 --> 00:04:00,239
we've got to make cannabis legal in

90
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:02,000
America in the United States

91
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:05,200
