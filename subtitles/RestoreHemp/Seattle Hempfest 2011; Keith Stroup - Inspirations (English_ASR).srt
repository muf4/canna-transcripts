1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,799
who are some of your greatest

2
00:00:01,639 --> 00:00:06,080
Inspirations in our movement I mean it

3
00:00:03,799 --> 00:00:09,120
doesn't have to be someone that's hemp

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:11,759
related but who who gets you going well

5
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:14,039
frankly one of the best examples of a of

6
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:16,000
a really valuable committed activist

7
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:18,519
that I know in the entire country is

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,039
Vivian Peak who puts his place on I I

9
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:22,320
don't know of anyone who works any

10
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:24,880
harder it's all volunteer labor he's

11
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,359
done for 20 years he's had some health

12
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:30,678
problems nothing holds them back um and

13
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:33,120
it's the biggest of marijuana protest in

14
00:00:30,678 --> 00:00:35,199
the world and uh I I it's my favorite

15
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:37,280
day of the year it used to be two days

16
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,399
now it's three days but my favorite trip

17
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,160
of the year I love forward to so Vivian

18
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:45,280
would be somebody who stands out to show

19
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:46,599
what one person could do um I'll I I

20
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,280
would I don't want to be unfair to

21
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:51,399
people there's lots of people that

22
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:53,160
contributed um but I think the people

23
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:54,920
that deserve the most credit right now

24
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:57,479
are the people that are pushing us

25
00:00:54,920 --> 00:01:00,559
Beyond medical use into full

26
00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:03,079
legalization um and so I I really admire

27
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:05,920
the efforts undergoing right now in

28
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:08,359
Colorado Washington Oregon California

29
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,439
and Massachusetts to get initiatives on

30
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:13,640
the ballot to legalize marijuana in all

31
00:01:10,438 --> 00:01:13,639
five states
