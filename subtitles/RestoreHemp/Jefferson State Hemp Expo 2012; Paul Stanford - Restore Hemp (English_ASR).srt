1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:06,318
start I started drafting this thing

2
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:09,599
started drafting it way back in uh

3
00:00:06,318 --> 00:00:11,080
1988 so uh I didn't dream back then I'd

4
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:13,480
still be working on it all these years

5
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:17,399
later but we finally put it on the

6
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:20,640
ballot and it is a

7
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:24,198
transformative proposal it would make HP

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:26,599
and marijuana completely legal you'd be

9
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:29,320
able to grow your own without a permit

10
00:00:26,599 --> 00:00:32,159
license or registration you'd be able to

11
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:35,878
sell seed and starts of all varieties of

12
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:38,039
cannabis without permit license or

13
00:00:35,878 --> 00:00:41,159
registration you want to sell the

14
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:43,878
flowers you'd have to get a license and

15
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:46,679
you'd have to process it so there'd be a

16
00:00:43,878 --> 00:00:49,159
a process around selling the flowers but

17
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:50,960
you know I really believe that the only

18
00:00:49,159 --> 00:00:53,279
reason marijuana is illegal is because

19
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:56,359
of hip Fuel and hip

20
00:00:53,280 --> 00:01:00,198
fiber the word marijuana was based as we

21
00:00:56,359 --> 00:01:03,280
know on on racist propaganda from theet

22
00:01:00,198 --> 00:01:05,359
chemical industry they realized that

23
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,960
with new technology that made hemp

24
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:10,000
cultivation a lot cheaper that the price

25
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:12,118
of hip products were going to fall

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,759
dramatically just as with the invention

27
00:01:12,118 --> 00:01:16,799
of the cotton gin the price of cotton

28
00:01:13,759 --> 00:01:19,159
had fallen to a penny on the dollar the

29
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,560
price of hemp was set to do that with

30
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:24,759
the invention of new decorticating

31
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:28,519
Machinery so they came up with a new

32
00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:30,438
name for hip everybody knew what hip was

33
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:34,319
they came up with a new name and they

34
00:01:30,438 --> 00:01:37,559
got it from Mexico from a revolutionary

35
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:40,559
war song Poncho V led the Mexican

36
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:43,320
Revolution in 1911 and they had a song

37
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,240
called lukar Racha you guys might have

38
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:47,239
heard it when I was a kid I remember

39
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:51,239
Bugs Bunny used to sing it

40
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:54,239
laara laara anyway in that song I Won't

41
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:57,158
Tor you anymore my singing But in that

42
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:59,000
song they said the Cockroach smoked

43
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:00,478
marijuana well when the Mexican

44
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,280
Revolution happened

45
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:06,039
happened they nationalized the oil

46
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,199
industry and the Mexican petroleum

47
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:11,318
production is still nationalized and run

48
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:14,759
by the government well the Oil Barons in

49
00:02:11,318 --> 00:02:17,399
Pennsylvania and Texas did not like that

50
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:20,280
so they took this word from this Mexican

51
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:22,800
Revolutionary War song and they created

52
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,199
a whole misinformation propaganda

53
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,000
campaign about it and said that there's

54
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:30,039
this deadly new drug called marijuana

55
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,479
causes people go crazy and kill their

56
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:37,199
family and friends so based on that

57
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:38,039
baloney they were able to prohibit hemp

58
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:41,079
but

59
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:43,679
hemp is tied to our

60
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:48,360
civilization in fact if you go back over

61
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:51,159
12,000 years ago all the new

62
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:54,640
agricultural civilizations in Asia were

63
00:02:51,158 --> 00:02:56,399
growing hemp hemp was originally from

64
00:02:54,639 --> 00:03:01,238
high up in the Himalaya Mountains in

65
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:05,158
present day Tibet Nepal Kashmir

66
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:09,200
Afghanistan and by at least 12,000 years

67
00:03:05,158 --> 00:03:13,120
ago and perhaps over 30,000 years

68
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:17,000
ago people learned to cultivate it and

69
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:19,400
they spread down and form civilizations

70
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,878
all across Asia and the ones we know

71
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:24,840
about today we call Mesopotamia along

72
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:28,719
the tigress and Euphrates River Valley

73
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:30,799
in present day Iraq our prehistoric

74
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:32,438
China along the yellow River the Wang

75
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:35,480
haa in

76
00:03:32,438 --> 00:03:38,400
China and in those communities they were

77
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:41,878
growing hemp and it's a common crop it's

78
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:45,280
the oldest crop known to man and We Know

79
00:03:41,878 --> 00:03:48,079
It produces more fuel more fiber more

80
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,640
food and more medicine than any other

81
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,319
plant on this

82
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:55,238
planet and the prochemical people

83
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:58,238
realized that that it was going

84
00:03:55,239 --> 00:04:00,480
to displace with new technology it's

85
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:03,560
going to displace a lot of their

86
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:06,919
economic fight you know petroleum is

87
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:09,959
what economists call Capital intensive

88
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:12,438
takes a lot of money or capital and they

89
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:15,159
take tens of millions hundreds of

90
00:04:12,438 --> 00:04:18,680
millions of dollars some cases billion

91
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:21,120
dollars to go out and drill for

92
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:23,519
petroleum and it takes tens of billions

93
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,280
hundred billion dollars to refine

94
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:30,279
petroleum into all the different

95
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:33,038
products we make it if you can grow

96
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:36,519
very inexpensively and you get a cheap

97
00:04:33,038 --> 00:04:39,199
oil press and get at least 300 gallons

98
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:43,000
of oil per acre and the byproduct of

99
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:47,240
that is 3 tons or 6,000 lbs of high

100
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:51,439
protein hip seed meal so HP prohibition

101
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:54,000
is really about Fuel and fiber and the

102
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:57,120
continued centralization of Economic and

103
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,720
political control it's about this plant

104
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,439
that makes more fuel fiber food and

105
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:04,600
medicine than any other

106
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:07,879
plant and so our initiative would

107
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:11,160
completely restore that hip cultivation

108
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:15,759
will not be limited to low THC strains

109
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:18,600
low THC Y is there's no reason

110
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:22,280
to grow low THC H it produces half as

111
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:24,720
much fiber and 12th as much seed oil and

112
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:28,000
protein what they've done with low THC H

113
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:31,160
is they bred out the flowers by breeding

114
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,759
out the flowers they bred out the seeds

115
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:35,520
and the seeds are where the oil's at and

116
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,840
that's what they don't want us to have

117
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:40,560
because you can take hip seed oil or a

118
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:42,359
lot of other vegetable oils and pour it

119
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,399
right into any diesel engine and turn

120
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:47,720
the key and drive it yeah now hip is

121
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:51,439
three times more productive than the

122
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:55,720
next most productive seed oil crop those

123
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:59,399
are canola or rape seed soy beans and

124
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:02,680
sunflower seeds each of those make about

125
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:06,198
100 to 120 gallons of oil per acre where

126
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:09,360
HP makes at least 300 gallons of oil per

127
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:12,280
acre given the economics of biodiesel

128
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,720
today we should see hip biodiesel for

129
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:16,399
less than a buck a

130
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:20,039
gallon and the petrochemical companies

131
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:23,758
don't want to compete with that so our

132
00:06:20,038 --> 00:06:26,439
initiative frees that and it's ballot

133
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,240
measure 80 you know it's on the ballot

134
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:29,560
this

135
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:33,360
November the best thing you can Poss

136
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:35,280
possibly do is register and vote if you

137
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,598
haven't been registered in the past you

138
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:38,799
haven't registered because you don't

139
00:06:36,598 --> 00:06:40,120
want to participate in the political

140
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,639
process you didn't think there was

141
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:45,160
anything worth voting for well this year

142
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:48,038
there is something worth voting for

143
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:51,240
there's ballot measure 80 and you can

144
00:06:48,038 --> 00:06:54,120
vote to end marijuana prohibition and

145
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:56,319
let our brother sisters out of jail and

146
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:58,840
restore hemp for fuel fiber food and

147
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,960
medicine and completely transform our

148
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:02,638
economy

149
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:05,000
[Applause]

150
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:07,400
you know they say the energy industry is

151
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:11,598
the world's largest

152
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:13,359
industry and it uh the money that comes

153
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:16,918
from that goes into the pockets of these

154
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:21,199
Saudi Arabian chics Nigerian despots

155
00:07:16,918 --> 00:07:23,359
Exxon Mobile shell British Petroleum and

156
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:25,879
they put it into their Swiss bank

157
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,960
accounts when our farmers can get that

158
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:30,800
energy money for hip biodiesel fuel that

159
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:35,000
money will go into our local communities

160
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:37,560
and Revitalize our towns and reorient

161
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,160
our entire

162
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:42,639
economy that's what it's all

163
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:45,759
about it's

164
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:48,038
really it's really a conspiracy from the

165
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:50,280
petrochemical pharmaceutical military

166
00:07:48,038 --> 00:07:53,279
industrial transnational corporate Elite

167
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:53,279
fascist sons of a

168
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:59,598

00:07:59,598 --> 00:08:04,478
Pacific fighting the fascists we

171
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:07,079

172
00:08:04,478 --> 00:08:09,478
