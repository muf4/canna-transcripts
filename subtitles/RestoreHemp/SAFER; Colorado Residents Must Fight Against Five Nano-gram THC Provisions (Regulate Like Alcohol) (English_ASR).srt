1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,919
probably be

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:06,480
uh at least another year year and a half

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:08,320
before we see stores open

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,320
in washington colorado what do you think

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:14,000
in terms of your state to

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:16,480
agua well i believe that five nanograms

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,719
is a totally inappropriate

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,600
uh standard that's free and they're

9
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:21,358
driving

10
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,118
and for yeah driving the to the five

11
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,199
nanograms because

12
00:00:23,118 --> 00:00:26,640
uh i don't know your cameras can get

13
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,400
this yeah we can get a camera to close

14
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,800
in on that

15
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:32,960
they're trying okay but uh five

16
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,280
nanograms is solid still totally

17
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,520
inappropriate standard because

18
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,840
uh at five nanograms the driver is still

19
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:43,040
five percent safer

20
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:45,760
than a totally sober driver

21
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:47,679
now okay so you can see the line uh the

22
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:50,000
lower line is the

23
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:52,799
five nanogram

24
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,399
level this is uh let's see this is

25
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:56,479
sober driver

26
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,960
and there's uh five nanograms you find

27
00:00:56,479 --> 00:01:01,439
that at two and a half nanograms a

28
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,600
driver is thirty percent safer

29
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:06,319
than a sober driver

30
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:09,359
and at five nanograms

31
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:11,759
they're still five percent safer

32
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:13,840
than a sober driver so they should not

33
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,840
be punished

34
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,400
for being at that level that's the

35
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,159
detectable level and in colorado they're

36
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,840
attempting and they don't have it in

37
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,080
place yet they're attempting to

38
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,799
establish that the presence of five

39
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:29,519
nanograms of

40
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:31,118
thc is used as evidence of other drug

41
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:32,879
use and they're basing that on the

42
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:34,799
washington law which just kind of

43
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:37,438
plucked it out of the air

44
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:40,960
it's totally inappropriate uh alcohol

45
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:44,639
this is the level of impairment at uh we

46
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:48,000
you know 0.8 at point zero eight zero

47
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:50,879
eight at .08 blood alcohol

48
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,519
um there's a lot of evidence that

49
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:56,959
drivers are six to ten times more likely

50
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:59,199
to be in an accident or traffic fatality

51
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:01,759
so this is the level of impairment that

52
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,439
corresponds to 0.08

53
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,920
blood alcohol

54
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:08,239
the voters said that they wanted to

55
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,318
regulate marijuana like alcohol this is

56
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,680
the level of impairment if somebody's

57
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:13,598
impaired to this level they should not

58
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,360
be on the road no matter why and that

59
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:17,839
was colorado's law that was the actual

60
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,680
name of it regulate marijuana like

61
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,520
alcohol that so that was the main

62
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,959
central battle cry that's what voters

63
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,080
were calling for yeah and that's

64
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:27,920
amendment 64 in colorado that's right

65
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,440
and so it's an amendment to the colorado

66
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:31,359
constitution doesn't they give it a lot

67
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:33,759
of extra weight and judicial proceedings

68
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,959
well it means that anything that uh

69
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:39,120
departs from

70
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,560
regulating marijuana like alcohol as a

71
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,640
violation of the colorado state

72
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,239
constitution but i don't want to wait

73
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:46,719
until you go to

74
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,959
an appellate court in order for this to

75
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:52,000
be torn down it should be stopped where

76
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:54,000
it is and uh when that but it hasn't

77
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,039
passed in colorado's legislature yet

78
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,400
correct the senate uh voted it down they

79
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:00,239
said they're very concerned about

80
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,879
impaired drivers but they're more

81
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:05,759
concerned about punishing non-impaired

82
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:05,759
drivers
