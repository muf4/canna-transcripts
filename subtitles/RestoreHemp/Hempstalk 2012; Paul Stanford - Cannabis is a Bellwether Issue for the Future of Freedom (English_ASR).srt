00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:24,240
of new living wage jobs

9
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:27,920

people to grow hip horticulturally and

17
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,799
marijuana horticulturally

18
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:46,159
where you can breed your own strains

19
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:49,199
you'll be able to sell

20
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:52,398
seeds and starts without a license fee

21
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,399
or registration

22
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:58,078
if you want to sell the buds then

23
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,079
you don't have to get a license to grow

24
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:03,520
it process it

25
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:05,840
and sell it but it will

26
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:09,359
free it and no one will be going to jail

27
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,359
for marijuana anymore

28
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,600
you know there are dozens of people over

29
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,479
a hundred here in the united states

30
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:18,559
right now

31
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:20,640
serving a sentence of life without the

32
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,600
possibility of parole

33
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,359
just for growing marijuana they never

34
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:26,959
threatened another person they never

35
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:30,159
owned a gun

36
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:31,039
they never stole anything and they're in

37
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,359
prison

38
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,880
for growing a plant that's the first

39
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:36,478
agricultural crop

40
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:38,478
it's been grown by people at least

41
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:42,478
twelve thousand years

42
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:45,840
maybe 30 000 years the first cloth

43
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:50,399
the first rope the first paper

44
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,399
were all invented from marijuana

45
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:57,280
the whole thing about the low thc hip

46
00:01:54,078 --> 00:02:00,399
let me tell you it's bs

47
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:02,399
hip higher thc hip

48
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,239
will make more seeds and more oil and

49
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:07,439
marijuana prohibition is not

50
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:09,840
about marijuana they created this myth

51
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:11,359
when they made it illegal everybody knew

52
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,640
what hip was they couldn't have

53
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,800
criminalized him

54
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:17,119
so they said they had a deadly new drug

55
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:21,120
called marijuana

56
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:22,239
and so uh and we know that it's the

57
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,680
oldest agricultural

58
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,719
crop and it produces more oil for fuel

59
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,760
and food

60
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:32,239
more protein more fiber

61
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:33,280
more medicine than any other plant on

62
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,319
this planet

63
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:39,519
yeah they've taken the

64
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:42,479
first crop purposely sown by humans

65
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:44,239
the one that produces more fuel fiber

66
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:47,199
food and medicine than any other

67
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,759
and they made it illegal and the reason

68
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:51,039
is because

69
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:53,039
economic and political control

70
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:55,199
you know it's about the petrochemical

71
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:56,639
pharmaceutical military industrial

72
00:02:55,199 --> 00:03:00,878
transnational

73
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:03,679
fascist elite ruling class

74
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:04,000
we will legalize marijuana but we need

75
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,959
you

76
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,560
guys to register and vote you don't have

77
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,239
to vote for everything either

78
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,560
you know you don't have to vote for all

79
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,480
those judges if you don't want to

80
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:19,840
it's up to you but we need you to

81
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:19,840
register and vote for measure 80.

82
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,840
you know if you have not got a ballot in

83
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,719
the mail in the past

84
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,878
year you need to re-register because so

85
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:32,560
many people get thrown off the rolls for

86
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:36,560
being inactive voters

87
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:39,120
or if you've moved since you last voted

88
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,560
you need to re-register now we have

89
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,319

and register right online so you need to

94
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:55,759
if each of you

95
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,519
got 10 other people to register and vote

96
00:03:55,759 --> 00:04:00,719

18 registered and voted

98
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:06,479
we will win this election and restore

99
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,480
freedom in america

100
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:11,280
you know there are a lot of trends going

101
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:13,359
on right now

102
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:16,000
things are happening technology has been

103
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:19,359
growing exponentially

104
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,839
you know we've seen it in the internet

105
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:23,039
and we're seeing it with genomic or bio

106
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:26,079
biological tech

107
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:29,840
biotech where they're creating

108
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:32,879
new organs they've got nanotechnology

109
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:34,959
tiny microscopic machines and

110
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:36,478
artificial intelligence all of those

111
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:39,599
things are converging

112
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:42,719
in the next 30 years the possibilities

113
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:45,280
are terrifying if we don't expand

114
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,479
natural individual rights to include

115
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:48,478
freedom of thought

116
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:51,360
freedom of consciousness and the right

117
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:54,399
to get high

118
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,759
the future of freedom the dystopian

119
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:59,039
possibilities

120
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:02,479
are grim things like the terminator

121
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,600
and the matrix are just the tip of the

122
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:06,478
iceberg

123
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,479
so marijuana is a bellwether issue for

124
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:10,800
the future of freedom

125
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:13,038
it's about freedom of thought and

126
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:17,600
economic and social justice

127
00:05:13,038 --> 00:05:17,599
so register and vote
