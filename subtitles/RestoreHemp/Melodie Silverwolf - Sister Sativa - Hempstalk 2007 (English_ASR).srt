1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,700
I work with the th CF clinic and for me

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:07,349
you know I call my cell Suzuki but

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,480
everybody laughs ending but you know I

4
00:00:07,349 --> 00:00:12,239
really am a priestess I'm a totally high

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:14,809
priestess and I am actually trained as a

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:18,060
Wiccan in a very radical tradition

7
00:00:14,808 --> 00:00:19,948
called the reclaiming tradition where we

8
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:21,750
blend our politics and our spirituality

9
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:23,939
and that's why I do this for a living

10
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:26,099
because I not only believe in it but

11
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:29,609
it's also a spiritual calling for me and

12
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:32,520
you know Wiccans believe that the sacred

13
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:35,010
isn't everything in each person in each

14
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,840
living thing in the earth even in

15
00:00:35,009 --> 00:00:40,799
inanimate objects that we are all part

16
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:42,809
of the sacred and it was a very fine

17
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:45,538
poem written some years ago by a woman

18
00:00:42,808 --> 00:00:47,939
called the charge of the goddess and in

19
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:49,980
there it says that you know says if

20
00:00:47,939 --> 00:00:52,308
that's what you seek you find not within

21
00:00:49,979 --> 00:00:54,419
yourself you will never find it without

22
00:00:52,308 --> 00:00:57,058
and I guess that's what i want to say

23
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:59,219
today that you know we're all seeking we

24
00:00:57,058 --> 00:01:01,289
all follow cannabis for many reasons

25
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:03,600
it's a healer in many ways some of us

26
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:05,640
use it to heal our bodies some of us

27
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,099
heal to you use it to heal our spirits

28
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:11,280
our emotions or the wounds that we've

29
00:01:08,099 --> 00:01:13,109
been accumulated during our lives but I

30
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,159
think it's really important to use it to

31
00:01:13,109 --> 00:01:18,900
find your truth and to act on that truth

32
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,368
over and over from the stage all weekend

33
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:22,530
people have been telling you how you can

34
00:01:20,368 --> 00:01:24,150
get involved we're not just saying that

35
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:25,710

40
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,420
working in the booze and making this

41
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:38,909
event a reality everybody was once just

42
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:41,099
a person like you who smoke pot and

43
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:42,630
thought it was cool and you really wish

44
00:01:41,099 --> 00:01:45,149
it wasn't Lee illegal but you weren't

45
00:01:42,629 --> 00:01:46,739
quite sure what to do and now we're all

46
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:48,629
we've all walked down this road and we

47
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:51,089
want you to join us because that's how

48
00:01:48,629 --> 00:01:54,149
it's going to become a reality that's

49
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:56,219
how this sacrament this thing that heals

50
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:58,680
us that keeps us going that raises our

51
00:01:56,218 --> 00:02:01,379
spirits that helps us to bond to one

52
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:04,829
another remember how who we are it's in

53
00:02:01,379 --> 00:02:07,709
our control to make it legal it's in our

54
00:02:04,828 --> 00:02:09,239
hands and we all have to do something so

55
00:02:07,709 --> 00:02:09,568
don't just go home and think hey that

56
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:11,730
was a

57
00:02:09,568 --> 00:02:13,858
a fun festival I could hardly wait till

58
00:02:11,729 --> 00:02:15,419
next year and you know sit down and

59
00:02:13,859 --> 00:02:18,689
smoke your joint and sort of forget all

60
00:02:15,419 --> 00:02:21,718
about it we need you to be a part of

61
00:02:18,688 --> 00:02:24,748
this movement every single one of you

62
00:02:21,718 --> 00:02:27,568
have something that you can give and I'm

63
00:02:24,748 --> 00:02:30,388
asking you now to give it and I'd like

64
00:02:27,568 --> 00:02:32,339
to paraphrase John Kennedy what he said

65
00:02:30,389 --> 00:02:35,370
ask not what your country can do for you

66
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:38,459
ask what you can do for your country and

67
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:42,959
I'd like to tell you ask not what bud

68
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:48,840
can do for you ask what you can do for

69
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:50,938
bud and then do it you know it's not

70
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,218
right everybody knows about the law of

71
00:02:50,938 --> 00:02:55,590
karma we know what people you know what

72
00:02:53,218 --> 00:02:58,229
constitutes a person of character in

73
00:02:55,590 --> 00:03:00,120
this society it's not right to take and

74
00:02:58,229 --> 00:03:03,030
take and take and never give back we all

75
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:05,400
know that so it's time to give back

76
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:08,699
everybody out there I want you to think

77
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:10,799
about what can I do even if you have

78
00:03:08,699 --> 00:03:13,379
very limited money and very limited time

79
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:15,419
and very limited resources you can do

80
00:03:13,378 --> 00:03:18,438
something to make this movement a

81
00:03:15,419 --> 00:03:21,599
reality to make real legalization

82
00:03:18,438 --> 00:03:23,340
normalization decriminalization possible

83
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:25,649
to make it a reality in our lifetimes

84
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:27,389
you know I don't want to be 90 years old

85
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:30,090
and still have not accomplished this

86
00:03:27,389 --> 00:03:32,639
it's time folks I'm looking at every

87
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:35,069
single one of you out there I'm talking

88
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:37,079
