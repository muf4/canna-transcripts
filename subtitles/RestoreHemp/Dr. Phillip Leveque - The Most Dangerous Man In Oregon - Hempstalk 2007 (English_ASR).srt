1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,960
there you go

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:09,419
I was a battalion Scout and point man

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,339
and any of you guys or veterans you know

4
00:00:09,419 --> 00:00:13,798
what the hell a point man means the life

5
00:00:11,339 --> 00:00:16,138
expectancy is about 30 minutes or so

6
00:00:13,798 --> 00:00:19,198
something like that

7
00:00:16,138 --> 00:00:20,278
and uh I was in a war history writing

8
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,220
class

9
00:00:20,278 --> 00:00:25,140
with about 10 Vietnam guys and I told

10
00:00:23,219 --> 00:00:27,358
him that I was a point man and Scout Day

11
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:29,399
says oh no you weren't and I said God

12
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,740
damn it yes I was and he's nah you

13
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:38,719
weren't if you were you'd be dead

14
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:38,719
so here I am mean as hell and so forth

15
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,820
how many of you read this

16
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:46,799
new Oregonian last week about the DEA

17
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:49,320
trying to get a hold of your patients

18
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:52,619
charts how many you raise your hands you

19
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:55,020
read that well let me tell you the DEA

20
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:58,439
skunks and the local cops are all going

21
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:59,820
crazy because you bastards have permits

22
00:00:58,439 --> 00:01:02,459
to use marijuana

23
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:04,618
and you have permits to grow it and you

24
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:06,478
have permits to carry it you know

25
00:01:04,618 --> 00:01:08,280
premise to give it to somebody else and

26
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:10,679
all that kind of stuff

27
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:13,379
and there are 15

28
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:15,420
000 of you guys with permits right now

29
00:01:13,379 --> 00:01:18,379
15 000 in Oregon

30
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:18,379
foreign

31
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:29,099
caregiver Growers

32
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:31,280
so that makes about 22 000 people who

33
00:01:29,099 --> 00:01:34,559
had the permits right now

34
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:36,540
this is this is small potatoes because

35
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,900
in California

36
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:41,960
there are over 300 000 people who have

37
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:44,700
permits

38
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:48,319
well California I understand is a little

39
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,320
bit larger than uh Oregon

40
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:55,439
if I say Oregon do you

41
00:01:52,438 --> 00:01:59,158
you know well I lived east east of the

42
00:01:55,438 --> 00:02:01,798
Mississippi for about 20 years or so and

43
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:05,340
back there I was from Oregon

44
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:08,159
and that used to grade on my nerves

45
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:10,200
and so I finally figured out

46
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:12,000
thank God they've never been out here

47
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:13,619
because if they ever say that in the

48
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,659
state of Oregon they get somebody hit

49
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:17,000
him over the head of the brick

50
00:02:15,659 --> 00:02:20,840
yeah

51
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,840
thank you sir I'm Adam

52
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:24,919
um

53
00:02:25,318 --> 00:02:32,539
when the board took away my license in

54
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:32,539
November three years ago

55
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:36,059
um

56
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:39,060
I was really disgusted with this because

57
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:40,979
they thought that they were punishing me

58
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:44,159
they were not punishing me they were

59
00:02:40,979 --> 00:02:47,459
they were punishing my 4 000 patients

60
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:50,039
and and I I got the idea that they were

61
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:51,239
trying to stop the medical marijuana

62
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:54,659
program

63
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:57,360
but as most of you know the

64
00:02:54,659 --> 00:03:01,139
THC Foundation Clinic

65
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,160
is probably seeing about 200 patients a

66
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:05,098
week

67
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:08,400
and we're increasing the number of

68
00:03:05,098 --> 00:03:10,399
patients all the time

69
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:16,200
um

70
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:19,319
there are 2 200 doctors in Oregon now

71
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:20,878
who are signing applications 2 200 of

72
00:03:19,318 --> 00:03:22,878
them

73
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:26,098
and

74
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:29,280
some of you know many of you don't know

75
00:03:26,098 --> 00:03:32,098
I'm actually an osteopathic doctor

76
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,378
and believe it or not there are 200

77
00:03:32,098 --> 00:03:36,000
osteopathic doctors who are signing

78
00:03:34,378 --> 00:03:38,878
these applications

79
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,158
and I thought I was the only one

80
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:43,199
and because I thought I was the only one

81
00:03:41,158 --> 00:03:44,699
I was a real bad person and that's one

82
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:47,280
of the reasons why I'm wearing this cute

83
00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:49,560
thing right here that I'm I'm the most

84
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,979
dangerous man in Oregon because it sits

85
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:54,598
so in Oregonian we love you we love you

86
00:03:52,979 --> 00:03:57,119
Dr Buck

87
00:03:54,598 --> 00:04:00,839
that that reminds me thank you very much

88
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:04,379
that reminds me of several years ago uh

89
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:06,060
on our television program a man phoned

90
00:04:04,378 --> 00:04:08,759
up and wanted to know if his medical

91
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:11,819
condition would permit him to get a a

92
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:13,679
permit and so forth and and so he told

93
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:15,238
me what his medical condition was and he

94
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,759
says hell yes I said you're eligible

95
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:19,798
come under the office and he says Dr

96
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:22,459
Levesque I'd like to have a relationship

97
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:22,459
with you

98
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:27,560
said if you don't mind please don't say

99
00:04:25,379 --> 00:04:27,560
that

100
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:32,819
on so uh I hope you you two guys don't

101
00:04:31,379 --> 00:04:36,360
want to have a relationship with me

102
00:04:32,819 --> 00:04:37,918
because I I gave all that stuff up

103
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:40,379
I I

104
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:43,279
was a Boy Scout till I was 14 and then I

105
00:04:40,379 --> 00:04:43,279
became a Girl Scout

106
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,939
um I have just started writing articles

107
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:54,180
about medical marijuana

108
00:04:50,939 --> 00:04:56,579
the website is called Salem Dash

109
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:58,918
news.com

110
00:04:56,579 --> 00:05:02,099
and I try to write at least one article

111
00:04:58,918 --> 00:05:04,198
a week about all the sundry aspects of

112
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:05,759
medical marijuana what we're

113
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:08,160
concentrating on right now is

114
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:12,139
post-traumatic stress disorder

115
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,139
how many vets I got in the office here

116
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:16,100
you poor dumb bastards

117
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:21,500
don't volunteer for [ __ ] that's all I

118
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:21,500
have to say

119
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:27,180
at any rate

120
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:30,500
even the Veterans Administration admits

121
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:34,139
that they are failing to take care of

122
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:36,899
post-traumatic stress patients

123
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:40,918
um which which is a real surprise

124
00:05:36,899 --> 00:05:43,620
because I was in the VA Hospital

125
00:05:40,918 --> 00:05:45,719
about 50 years ago

126
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:48,240
and they told my mother on three

127
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:50,160
occasions that we don't believe your

128
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,500
son's gonna make it

129
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,600
and I fooled him

130
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:57,899
and I survived

131
00:05:54,600 --> 00:06:01,860
and then about two years later

132
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:04,079
I met one of my doctors in the hallway

133
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:06,120
of the medical school and he looks me up

134
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:08,339
and down he says you're levec aren't you

135
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:11,160
and I said yeah I'm levec he says well

136
00:06:08,339 --> 00:06:14,219
are you a janitor here

137
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,960
and I says no I'm a PhD candidate and he

138
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:16,500
says

139
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:18,299
really

140
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:21,600
I says what do you mean really he says

141
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:23,520
we never thought should be normal again

142
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,539
so if any of you think that I'm normal

143
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:26,538
you're crazier than hell

144
00:06:26,579 --> 00:06:31,859
now does do any of you have any

145
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:34,439
questions of any something or other

146
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:36,538
I have I have become one of the world's

147
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:38,759
authorities on medical marijuana so ask

148
00:06:36,538 --> 00:06:41,519
me anything

149
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:44,580
how do I qualify for to get a card

150
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:47,939
oh okay

151
00:06:44,579 --> 00:06:49,800
uh how how bashful are you

152
00:06:47,939 --> 00:06:51,719
come up here and talk to me

153
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:54,560
come on get up here

154
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,560
hey

155
00:07:04,038 --> 00:07:09,839
hey that's a very good question and fact

156
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:14,180
of the matter is over uh this past week

157
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:18,859
I wrote two articles about ADD and ADHD

158
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:18,860
and the California doctors

159
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:28,258
well my wife goes run by whose mouth

160
00:07:24,538 --> 00:07:31,259
my mom oh okay the doctors in California

161
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:33,538
and as far as I know there are about 70

162
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:37,020
doctors in California who are writing

163
00:07:33,538 --> 00:07:40,318
these permits but just like to say they

164
00:07:37,019 --> 00:07:42,418
have written over 300 000 by now and the

165
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,400
DEA and the local cops are going crazy

166
00:07:42,418 --> 00:07:45,899
down there because well what the hell

167
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:47,758
you're just a bunch of potheads and you

168
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:52,679
don't deserve even the time of day

169
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:56,580
so ADD and ADHD are good now

170
00:07:52,680 --> 00:08:00,000
I was invited uh back to a to a

171
00:07:56,579 --> 00:08:04,918
subcommittee at Congress three years ago

172
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:08,459
uh by representative Sauder from Indiana

173
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:12,000
and he represented Eli Lillian company

174
00:08:08,459 --> 00:08:15,239
in Indianapolis who had just developed a

175
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:19,439
new ADD ADHD drug

176
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:22,079
and so what solder wanted to do was to

177
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:25,500
quash the medical marijuana in the

178
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:28,620
United States completely and so I was

179
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:30,660
invited back there and I was told by the

180
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:33,538
marijuana policy project

181
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:35,219
that they were going to skin me alive so

182
00:08:33,538 --> 00:08:39,598
I decided not to go

183
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:42,300
but the stream now the it the Eli Lilly

184
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:45,300
company figured that the add drug would

185
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:47,939
bring in a billion dollars a year

186
00:08:45,299 --> 00:08:49,439
but after it was released and used for

187
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:50,820
about six months they found out it

188
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,540
didn't work

189
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:57,720
now this is really crazy because

190
00:08:53,539 --> 00:08:59,639
marijuana does work for kids and and

191
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:01,019
they don't smoke but they eat it in

192
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:03,319
cookies how many of you are cookie

193
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:03,320
eaters

194
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:08,360
if you're a smokers

195
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:14,180
I don't know why in the hell I asked

196
00:09:12,059 --> 00:09:14,179
that

197
00:09:15,419 --> 00:09:18,778
no

198
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:21,240
no I don't I don't well

199
00:09:18,778 --> 00:09:24,120
that's not exactly true

200
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:25,799
six years ago my youngest son gave me a

201
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:29,240
loaded bong for Christmas and he says

202
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:29,240
I'll dare you to light it up

203
00:09:31,259 --> 00:09:36,958
well I think it was pretty bad grass or

204
00:09:34,379 --> 00:09:39,059
some goddamn thing probably Mexican mud

205
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:40,619
who knows something like that but anyway

206
00:09:39,059 --> 00:09:42,539
I took a couple hits off and I said

207
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:44,639
Jesus Christ what what's what's so great

208
00:09:42,539 --> 00:09:46,500
about this stuff he said well you're not

209
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:49,699
taking enough of it

210
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,700
how many of you have heard that

211
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:58,220
how many of you ever been high

212
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,339
how many of you been high twice

213
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:14,039
what'd you say

214
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:16,580
how many guys have been in the high 37

215
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:16,579
years straight

216
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:27,360
I think this is hilarious

217
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:30,240
well I will say I will say that um

218
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:33,959
uh when I became a graduate student at

219
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:36,419
the medical school the first thing

220
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:38,039
the chairman says Levesque going to the

221
00:10:36,419 --> 00:10:40,679
stock room and see if you can straighten

222
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:42,958
it out so I went into the stock room and

223
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:44,278
the first thing that I found was a

224
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:47,518
gallon jug

225
00:10:44,278 --> 00:10:50,820
of cannabis cough medicine

226
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:52,500
this was 13 years after it was declared

227
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:54,180
illegal for anybody in the United States

228
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:56,458
to have anything like that

229
00:10:54,179 --> 00:10:59,099
and uh

230
00:10:56,458 --> 00:11:00,899
I said well it was made by Park Davis

231
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:02,399
and Company which is one of the largest

232
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:04,620
in the world

233
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:07,860
and I poured myself a pint and I took it

234
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:09,720
home and I tried it out and it works and

235
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:11,159
so I still have that point someplace

236
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,660
around my house

237
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:16,679
and uh

238
00:11:12,659 --> 00:11:18,539
I'll find it one of these days but uh

239
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:20,879
that was the only time that I actually

240
00:11:18,539 --> 00:11:23,219
smoked marijuana at that time but I I

241
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:24,059
have used the tincture and I've used the

242
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:26,820
oil

243
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:29,119
and they they work fine for me

244
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:33,980
and uh

245
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,980
uh how many of you ever had bad grass

246
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:40,439
did you like it raise your hands if you

247
00:11:37,379 --> 00:11:42,899
enjoyed it didn't like it

248
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:44,640
well it's great that in British Columbia

249
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:47,120
they're growing some of the best grass

250
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:47,120
in the world

251
00:11:47,179 --> 00:11:51,899
and some of the plants are being grown

252
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:53,819
into Portland area you probably know

253
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:57,480
that how many of you know that

254
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:59,040
you know that very good what do you want

255
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:00,420

256
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:02,278
throat

257
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:05,059

258
00:12:02,278 --> 00:12:05,059
