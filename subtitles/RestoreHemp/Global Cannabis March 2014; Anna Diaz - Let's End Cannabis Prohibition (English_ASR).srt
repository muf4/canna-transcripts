1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,259
what I would like to talk about today to

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:08,940
all of you is that

3
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:11,460
we need to look at the bigger picture we

4
00:00:08,939 --> 00:00:13,259
need to understand that in order for

5
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:16,679
what we're doing here at the state level

6
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:19,679
to be truly successful we need to make

7
00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:22,739
changes at the national level we need to

8
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:24,899
back representative blumenauer in his

9
00:00:22,739 --> 00:00:27,419
project and we need to reach out to

10
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:30,140
States outside of Oregon and let them

11
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:33,239
know that there's hope for them that by

12
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:35,280
descheduling cannabis and by allowing

13
00:00:33,238 --> 00:00:38,339
states to decide how cannabis is going

14
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,799
to be regulated Across the Nation we

15
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:43,020
open up doors for all of us that would

16
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:45,839
eliminate the moratoriums that we're

17
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:48,559
seeing on medical cannabis

18
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:52,680
um dispensaries here in Oregon right now

19
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:54,718
138 cities have enacted a moratorium for

20
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:55,679
a year on dispensaries because they

21
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,259
don't think that there's enough

22
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:59,939
regulation under the new rules I don't

23
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:00,899
know about you guys but I read those

24
00:00:59,939 --> 00:01:02,460
rules

25
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:05,519
come on

26
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:07,560
there's plenty of rules there to

27
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,618
regulate cannabis to keep it away from

28
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:14,460
kids to make it safer access for

29
00:01:10,618 --> 00:01:16,560
patients and I would suggest that

30
00:01:14,459 --> 00:01:18,539
although we do need to fight that battle

31
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,240
we need to fight the battle at the

32
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:23,640
national level even more because once

33
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:25,560
those restrictions are removed

34
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,618
you'll see that explosion that

35
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,420
Congressman blumenero was talking about

36
00:01:27,618 --> 00:01:33,180
and on we're on the we are on the verge

37
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:35,900
of that explosion legalization is coming

38
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:38,280
the law enforcement may not like it

39
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:40,259
there are people that don't like it but

40
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:43,799
it's coming whether they like it or not

41
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:46,500
how it comes about will be up to us we

42
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:48,240
do have the capability of having a huge

43
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,640
impact on what that's going to look like

44
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:53,578
the reason that these moratoriums are

45
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,899
happening and the reason that the law is

46
00:01:53,578 --> 00:01:56,398
a little tighter than we would like it

47
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:58,618
is because enough of us weren't there

48
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,239
talking about it we didn't go talk to

49
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:03,118
our legislators and let them know what

50
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:05,179
we really wanted so guess who was there

51
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:08,159
law enforcement

52
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:10,920
that's what they like to do to us throw

53
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:12,840
us in jail so

54
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:14,159
please as you're moving forward if

55
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,378
you've never done anything as an

56
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:18,359
activist before in your life besides

57
00:02:16,378 --> 00:02:20,098
come to one of these marches I would

58
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:22,860
suggest that maybe you take one little

59
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:24,959
step it doesn't have to be huge it

60
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:26,879
doesn't have to be a lot but you need to

61
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,979
be heard by someone other than this

62
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:30,899
group of people right here and you can

63
00:02:28,979 --> 00:02:33,959
do that by sending an email to your

64
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:36,239
Congressman it's really easy to do and

65
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:38,219
you can find information so that you can

66
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,860
be an informed speaker about cannabis

67
00:02:38,219 --> 00:02:43,680
just by Googling cannabis and the

68
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:45,780
disease of your choice or cannabis and

69
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,300
penalties or cannabis and children or

70
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:50,280
all of those myths that we've heard all

71
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:52,980
these years have been disapproved every

72
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:55,459
single one of them and we need to spread

73
00:02:52,979 --> 00:02:58,378
that word across the entire country

74
00:02:55,459 --> 00:03:00,719
bigger than Oregon bigger than anything

75
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:04,500
we can see here and we won't see changes

76
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:06,000
that we had not even imagined and on the

77
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,219
verge of those

78
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,080
um changes we see groups like the normal

79
00:03:08,219 --> 00:03:13,080
Women's Alliance who is working this

80
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,360
year to start program that deals with

81
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:18,000
women and pregnancy and children with

82
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,800
special needs and mediation and

83
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,439
arbitration for women who end up in

84
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:24,840
prison for cannabis laws because they

85
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:28,979
answered their boyfriend's phone who was

86
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:31,860
making the dope deal women are also part

87
00:03:28,979 --> 00:03:35,340
of the group that are marginalized in

88
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:37,319
this cannabis prohibition because along

89
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:39,239
with people of color women are going to

90
00:03:37,318 --> 00:03:40,560
jail who haven't even used cannabis like

91
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:43,319
I said just for answering the phone

92
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,539
families are getting torn apart and that

93
00:03:43,318 --> 00:03:47,579
needs to stop and you can do that by

94
00:03:45,539 --> 00:03:51,679
contacting your Congressman by

95
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:51,680
contacting your local representative by

96
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:56,400
e who is just starting we have a booth

97
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:58,259
over here and we would love to talk to

98
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,658
you about what we're trying to do we

99
00:03:58,259 --> 00:04:02,939
want to become a resource as cannabis

100
00:04:00,658 --> 00:04:05,098
legalization moves forward parents are

101
00:04:02,939 --> 00:04:06,359
going to need to go someplace to talk to

102
00:04:05,098 --> 00:04:08,340
figure out how to talk to their kids

103
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:10,439
about cannabis and that's what parents

104
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:13,680
for pot is about the normal Women's

105
00:04:10,438 --> 00:04:15,840
Alliance is another group of women who

106
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,519
share you my duty have come out of the

107
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,959
Cannabis closet and I would suggest to

108
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,120
everybody here that if you haven't done

109
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,519
that find a way to do it you guys can

110
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,660
only do it with one person even if they

111
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:26,279
only tell your best friend who never

112
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:28,380
knew that you smoked weed that you smoke

113
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:31,019
weed it's a step in the right direction

114
00:04:28,379 --> 00:04:33,120
and it's going to be the rock in the

115
00:04:31,019 --> 00:04:36,079
pond that's going to move ever outward

116
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:39,500
until finally we are free

117
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:41,579
I don't want to hear that word free

118
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:43,439
because that's what it's really about

119
00:04:41,579 --> 00:04:45,478
it's not about getting high it's not

120
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:48,000
about I like to eat my brownies it's not

121
00:04:45,478 --> 00:04:51,599
about I want to smoke a joint it's about

122
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,740
Freedom it's about personal freedom I

123
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,080
shouldn't have to have a drug test

124
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:57,300
because I work in an office neither

125
00:04:55,079 --> 00:05:00,000
should you yes we should be able to do

126
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:02,340
what we want when we go home at night as

127
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,139
long as it doesn't hurt anybody else

128
00:05:02,339 --> 00:05:05,819
and I don't know about you guys but the

129
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:07,439
only way I heard somebody if I'm smoking

130
00:05:05,819 --> 00:05:10,040
a bull at home is if I accidentally burn

131
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:10,040
their fingers

132
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:17,220
well everybody who comes here gets

133
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,560
excited about the March and we're

134
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:22,380
excited to be marching at it gives you a

135
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:24,120
really great buzz when you go home from

136
00:05:22,379 --> 00:05:26,100
this and you're thinking about what

137
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:28,860
happened here I hope that you will take

138
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:31,439
the opportunity to reach out to your

139
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:33,120
representatives to speak to them and let

140
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:35,879
them know how you feel about cannabis

141
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,620
laws to let people who are running for

142
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:40,019
office know that if they do not support

143
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:43,560
our ideas they're not going to get

144
00:05:40,019 --> 00:05:46,019
elected my name is Anna Diaz I'm a proud

145
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:49,399
Stoner join me and let's end cannabis

146
00:05:46,019 --> 00:05:49,399
prohibition thank you
