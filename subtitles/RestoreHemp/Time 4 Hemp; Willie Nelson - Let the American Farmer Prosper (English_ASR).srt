1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,200
millions of uh farmers all over the

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:07,120
world uh this country have been losing

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:09,599
their farms at the rate of

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,359
uh a million a year

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,960
uh acreage

6
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:14,798
farmers and you know at one time there

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,480
was eight million

8
00:00:14,798 --> 00:00:18,480
working farmers in this country american

9
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,399
family farmers now now we're down to

10
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,359
probably less than two million

11
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:23,759
uh

12
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,439
the big corporations it's the old story

13
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,720
of the big ones eating the little ones

14
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,399
and

15
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:31,118
they're running the small farmer off the

16
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:33,679
land and when that happens

17
00:00:31,118 --> 00:00:35,439
the farm town closes down

18
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:39,359
the first thing the hospitals and the

19
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:41,519
schools go and then what happens is

20
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:43,200
all these people are now unemployed they

21
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,600
move on to the next big city which

22
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,960
causes the same kind of problems in that

23
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,600
city

24
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,920
i i think that all the homelessness

25
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,160
alcoholism insanity all these things

26
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,079
that we experience unemployment in our

27
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:58,398
country can be traced back to the first

28
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:00,558
time the first american farmer was

29
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,719
forced off his land when he was unable

30
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:04,640
to make a living off of a hundred to a

31
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:06,560
hundred acres of land

32
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,519
and the reason for it is because they

33
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,519
have

34
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:11,200
asked him

35
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:14,000
demanded or

36
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:16,478
made it necessary that he raised

37
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,478
a crop below what it costs him to raise

38
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:19,519
it he loses money

39
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:22,319
on

40
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:24,640
for instance if he just example figures

41
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:28,399
for instance if he were to it cost him

42
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:30,799
two dollars to uh or three dollars to uh

43
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,320
plant and raise and harvest to get a

44
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,759
bushel of corn

45
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:35,438
and if he only gets two dollars and

46
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,640
fifty cents for that at the market then

47
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:38,879
he's losing

48
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,879
and this is an accepted practice in

49
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:43,199
american agriculture today for the

50
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:45,839
farmer to get less than what it costs

51
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,840
him to grow

52
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,640
and they keep trying to justify it with

53
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,478
subsidies and whatever but the american

54
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,280
farmer would rather go out here and work

55
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:56,959
hard and make his money the the hard way

56
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,439
the way he knows how to do it give him

57
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:01,359
an acre let him do what that acre can do

58
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:03,599
let him do it without all the pesticides

59
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:05,680
without all the chemicals don't don't

60
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:08,000
put his yield so

61
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,920
low his money so low that he has to use

62
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,159
every piece or every gallon of

63
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:14,318
pesticides that he can find to pour on

64
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:17,598
that acre of land in order to get enough

65
00:02:14,318 --> 00:02:19,598
money out to almost break even

66
00:02:17,598 --> 00:02:21,359
they have forced him into this position

67
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:23,759
there are even banks who will not loan

68
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,800
you any money at all unless you agree to

69
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:30,159
use x amount of pesticides and chemicals

70
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:32,400
on your land oh really absolutely

71
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:34,239
because they know that the only way you

72
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,080
can make your payment is if you get so

73
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,759
much off of that acre and the only way

74
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,760
you can get that much off of that acre

75
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:41,679
is to keep pouring the chemicals to that

76
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:43,840
one acre

77
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,920
what now when did you first become aware

78
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,280
of hemp as a cash crop

79
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:48,878
a couple of years ago i read a book i

80
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,719
think that a lot of us have read by now

81
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:52,079
called the emperor was no close and it

82
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:54,400
was uh

83
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,920
in that book there was a reprint of an

84
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,400
article

85
00:02:55,919 --> 00:03:01,518
the the one thing in in that book that i

86
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:05,039
saw that could not be argued with was an

87
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:06,959
article that came out in 1938 edition of

88
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:08,719
popular mechanics magazine february

89
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,920
edition if anybody wants to go check it

90
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:12,479
out

91
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:14,559
that said a billion a new billion dollar

92
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:16,560
crop for the farmers

93
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,039
do you think that farmers today would be

94
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,479
receptive to growing hemp as a cash crop

95
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:22,560
because of all the propaganda we've

96
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:24,000
heard over the years there are so many

97
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,598
people now who believe that it's that

98
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,519
it's the evil weed

99
00:03:25,598 --> 00:03:29,199
but we we kind of figure it because of

100
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,560
all the products that it can create that

101
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:32,399
it it could be a solution well

102
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,719
definitely i think most most people that

103
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,480
i talked to had no idea just like me

104
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:38,479
that hemp and marijuana was the same

105
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:40,959
thing

106
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:42,798
we were ignorant of that fact

107
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:45,039
also we were ignorant of the fact that

108
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:47,040
hemp could be used as food

109
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:50,000
it can be used as clothing the first

110
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:51,039
levi's in this country were made from uh

111
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,280
hemp

112
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:55,840
the first bibles

113
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,360
were printed on hemp paper

114
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,878
the declaration of independence the

115
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,200
first two copies of this was printed on

116
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:02,560
hemp paper people don't know that um now

117
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:04,560
when you're out there working with the

118
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:08,158
farmers side by side do you have an

119
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,920
opportunity to witness a ways that we

120
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:11,840
people who are not involved with the

121
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:14,079
farm communities on a daily basis those

122
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,319
of us who are driving to and from work

123
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,319
and stuck in our offices what can we do

124
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:20,159
to help the farmer overcome this misery

125
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:22,399
they've been together

126
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,160
as our backbone forever

127
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:25,839
there is a there's a great plan that

128
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,400
just

129
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:31,198
i found i became aware of it here uh

130
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:33,039
years ago last year in fact the farmers

131
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,040
have come up with this idea themselves

132
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:38,240
it's called parity giving

133
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,759
uh for instance if

134
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,199
you're a rich guy you got millions of

135
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,040
dollars you want to do something for the

136
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:45,680
poor the hungry people

137
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,439
uh you would uh buy

138
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,360
direct from the farmers pay them a

139
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:51,040
certain price for instance for corn if

140
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,560
you buy a million dollars worth of corn

141
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,160
from the farmers and pay them three

142
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,280
dollars a bushel whatever the market

143
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,479
price is

144
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:58,478
then you

145
00:04:56,478 --> 00:05:00,000
would be able to write off you give it

146
00:04:58,478 --> 00:05:03,039
to the hungry

147
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,120
you give it to the poor people okay then

148
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:08,240
you would write off what is considered a

149
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,519
parity price or a fair market price but

150
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,680
for your which would be in the

151
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:14,319
neighborhood of around seven dollars so

152
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,918
you get to charge you you buy it for

153
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:18,879
three dollars and get to write off seven

154
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:20,719
dollars so this would be a great benefit

155
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:22,639
not only to the to the guy with money

156
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,199
who wants to help to the farmer who gets

157
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,960
his products sold and also to the people

158
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,879
out there who hungry who needs the food

159
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:30,478
it's really ridiculous for people to be

160
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:34,079
starving to death on this planet when

161
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:34,079
there's a lot of food available
