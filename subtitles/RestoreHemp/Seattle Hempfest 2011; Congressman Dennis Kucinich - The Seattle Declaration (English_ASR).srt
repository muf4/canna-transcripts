00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:25,519
of things this same awareness brought

53
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,920
America's Founders to write the

54
00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:30,640

will bring America down it is a deficit

58
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:41,158
of public action when people discover

59
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:43,359
what happens when one person determines

60
00:02:41,158 --> 00:02:44,598
to make a difference and then merges

61
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,720
