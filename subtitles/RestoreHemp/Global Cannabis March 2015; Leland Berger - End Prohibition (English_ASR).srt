28
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:14,579
you might do is you might call people on

29
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:16,200
the 91 committee encourage them to make

30
00:01:14,579 --> 00:01:19,560
sure they don't adopt the Amendments

31
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:21,060
that change section 30 and 31 section 30

32
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,280
and 31

33
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:26,519
make it so there can only be reasonable

34
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:30,780
regulations and no moratoriums and makes

35
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:33,658
crystal clear that state law state law

36
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:36,180
prevails our friend Floyd przanski

37
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:39,359
senator prozonski in presenting to the

38
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:42,600
committee on this was asked by Andy

39
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:44,519
Olson representative from Albany a

40
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:46,679
former state trooper a guy who gets it

41
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:48,599
generally about medical marijuana

42
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:51,240
he said well you know does it really

43
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:53,039
need to be an absolute thing does it

44
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:55,019
have to be the same thing everywhere

45
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,360
that we have to have it that we can't

46
00:01:55,019 --> 00:02:01,859
ban it and Floyd looked at him and said

47
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:03,719
yeah we do because it's medicine

48
00:02:01,859 --> 00:02:05,399
Andy said well if you want to you know

49
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:07,859
it's not medicine federally and Floyd

50
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:11,580
said the people say it's medicine in

51
00:02:07,859 --> 00:02:13,979
Oregon it's medicine and science law and

52
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:16,680
fact and we're not going to have its

53
00:02:13,979 --> 00:02:18,238
distribution interfered with where it's

54
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,939
where it's licensed and regulated

55
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:24,140
anywhere in the State anymore that's

56
00:02:20,939 --> 00:02:24,139
over starting today

57
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:30,719
but I'll tell you what's not over what's

58
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:33,060
not over is the is the bigotry that

59
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:36,060
caused them to deny patients safe access

60
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:38,459
they there are some places there are

61
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:40,979
some people they just don't like our

62
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:44,340
kind and what they do is they wrap

63
00:02:40,979 --> 00:02:45,959
themselves in the flag and say well the

64
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:48,479
federal government says it's a schedule

65
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:51,180
one controlled substance well federal

66
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:52,738
law we're going to require that for you

67
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:54,540
to get a business license you have to be

68
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:55,800
in compliance with federal law you're

69
00:02:54,539 --> 00:02:59,159
not in compliance with federal law we're

70
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,160
not giving [ __ ]

71
00:02:59,219 --> 00:03:04,859
it's Oregon law and though and

72
00:03:01,979 --> 00:03:09,238
oregonians have the the power and the

73
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:11,879
right to to make it so that marijuana is

74
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:13,439
not legal or not illegal just because

75
00:03:11,878 --> 00:03:15,539
the federal government wants it to be

76
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:18,479
illegal doesn't mean they can require

77
00:03:15,539 --> 00:03:20,400
the states to make it illegal that's a

78
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:23,039
thing called commandeering in the law

79
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,400
and it's not allowed it's expressly not

80
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:25,400
allowed

81
00:03:27,539 --> 00:03:33,299
and it's how alcohol prohibition ended

82
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:36,598
alcohol prohibition ended when the state

83
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:39,060
said we're not going to have the Vols

84
00:03:36,598 --> 00:03:41,219
yeah when the the state said we're not

85
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:43,140
gonna We're Not Gonna enforce federal

86
00:03:41,219 --> 00:03:45,598
law anymore we're just not going to do

87
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:48,359
it at one point in New York City there

88
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:51,238
were more speakeasies than there were

89
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:53,640
churches that's what happens when

90
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:57,080
prohibition ends

91
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:59,579
but it doesn't you know um

92
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:03,239
