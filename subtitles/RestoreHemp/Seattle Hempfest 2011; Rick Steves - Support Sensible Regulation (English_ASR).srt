1
00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:04,200
it's great to be here

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:07,919
you know

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:10,800
I'm a travel writer and for me I've been

4
00:00:07,918 --> 00:00:12,119
thinking about this high is a place it's

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,660
a cool place

6
00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:17,759
it's a place where my speakers sound

7
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:18,899
remarkably good where suddenly I'm a

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,240
good cook

9
00:00:18,899 --> 00:00:23,459
we're conversations Slither around like

10
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:25,139
Stray Cats

11
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:27,179
sometimes I just want to go to that

12
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:29,640
place you know it's a cool place other

13
00:00:27,179 --> 00:00:32,278
people do too yeah but right now today

14
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,899
there's 80 000 Americans in jail because

15
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:36,000
they wanted to go there

16
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:38,219
and our government says we cannot go

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,960
there now there are cases when our

18
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:41,460
government can say we can't go somewhere

19
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,439
and I'll have and I'll buy it you know

20
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:45,000
but there's got to be a good

21
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:47,159
re and I've thought long and hard about

22
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,920
this and there's no good reason for our

23
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:53,538
government to tell us we can't go to the

24
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,539
place where a lot of you are right now

25
00:00:53,939 --> 00:01:00,179
I believe the responsible adult

26
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:02,539
recreational use of marijuana is a civil

27
00:01:00,179 --> 00:01:02,539
liberty

28
00:01:05,579 --> 00:01:10,739
can it's not healthy it can be abused it

29
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:13,079
can be addictive kids should not have

30
00:01:10,739 --> 00:01:14,459
access to it if you drive Intoxicated by

31
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:16,920
anything I think they should throw the

32
00:01:14,459 --> 00:01:19,859
book at you but that does not get in the

33
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:24,140
way of the basic principle that enjoying

34
00:01:19,859 --> 00:01:26,759
marijuana is a civil liberty

35
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:28,920
now our government is waging a very

36
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:31,140
expensive war against this idea the war

37
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,180
against marijuana is based on fear and

38
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,519
lies it's costing us billions of dollars

39
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:37,860
it's demoralizing our police force it's

40
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:39,780
corroding and eroding The credibility of

41
00:01:37,859 --> 00:01:41,759
parents and teachers when they need

42
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:43,560
credibility to teach our kids how to get

43
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,459
through the pitfalls of their young

44
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,040
years

45
00:01:44,459 --> 00:01:49,139
and it's also messing up hundreds of

46
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,939
thousands of lives in the last year

47
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:52,560
eight hundred thousand Americans were

48
00:01:50,938 --> 00:01:54,839
arrested for marijuana they've got

49
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,359
criminal records now these are not rich

50
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:59,399
white guys these are poor kids and these

51
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:01,500
are people of color and these are people

52
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:03,299
who cannot get through life with a bump

53
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,200
in the road like that it makes it very

54
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:07,020
tough

55
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:09,300
now I bring a European perspective into

56
00:02:07,019 --> 00:02:10,859
this discussion and I think we can learn

57
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:13,319
from Europe because they've got drug

58
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:15,239
problems too and they've treated not as

59
00:02:13,318 --> 00:02:17,759
a criminal problem but as a Health

60
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:20,219
Challenge and as an education challenge

61
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:22,378
if we can take the crime out of this

62
00:02:20,219 --> 00:02:24,719
equation we're going to do everybody a

63
00:02:22,378 --> 00:02:26,280
big favor my European friends tell me

64
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:28,859
that a society has to make a choice

65
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:31,500
tolerate alternative Lifestyles or build

66
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:33,360
more prisons and then they remind us

67
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,039
that in the United States here we're

68
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,260
really into prisons we lock up eight

69
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:38,459
times as many people per capita as the

70
00:02:37,259 --> 00:02:40,439
Europeans do and either there's

71
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:42,239
something wrong with our laws or we're

72
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:44,280
inherently more criminal people and I

73
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:47,700
think it's the former what suits

74
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:49,199
American drug policy is fear and we've

75
00:02:47,699 --> 00:02:50,280
got to overcome this fear a lot of

76
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:51,839
Americans think there's a whole

77
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,699
reservoir of people that would love to

78
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,800
ruin their lives if only marijuana was

79
00:02:53,699 --> 00:02:58,018
legal the fact is if illegal has

80
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,120
marijuana tomorrow not many more people

81
00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:01,739
would smoke pot people who enjoy pot are

82
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,439
already smoking it it just doesn't need

83
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:05,640
to be criminal it's been 25 years since

84
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:08,039
they arrested a person in the

85
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:09,958
Netherlands for smoking pot and it

86
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:12,598
doesn't they don't consume anymore in

87
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:15,000
fact statistically we Americans consume

88
00:03:12,598 --> 00:03:17,399
double the Dutch average 10 years ago

89
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,500
the Portuguese decriminalized the

90
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,000
consumption of all drugs they just did a

91
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,800
review and they think it makes a lot of

92
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,719
sense they take the crime out of the

93
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,420
equation and now it becomes a health

94
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:29,759
issue an education issue and people who

95
00:03:27,419 --> 00:03:32,219
want to smoke pot responsibility do and

96
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:33,719
this guy why does not fall now the

97
00:03:32,219 --> 00:03:35,039
spirit thing is really getting out of

98
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:36,840
hand a lot of people think it's a

99
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:38,699
gateway drug marijuana a couple of tokes

100
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,500
and you're on the way to being a heroin

101
00:03:38,699 --> 00:03:42,179
addict well what they found out in

102
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:44,519
Europe is the only thing Gateway about

103
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:46,799
marijuana is the fact that it's illegal

104
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:48,120
because when it's illegal people have to

105
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,739
buy it from people on the streets

106
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,120
selling stuff that's more addictive and

107
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:53,640
more profitable

108
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,860
hem fist is an exciting celebration of

109
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:57,598
cannabis culture but I feel a little

110
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:59,580
frustrated because I've been working 10

111
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:01,679
years to try to help all of us not be

112
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:04,560
criminals if we want to support or enjoy

113
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,299
marijuana we need to have a fun party

114
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,699
this weekend and then we need to

115
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:11,580
remember to take it into the suburbs

116
00:04:08,699 --> 00:04:14,579
take it to people who are afraid take

117
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:17,220
care out of it I gotta remind you we've

118
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:19,439
got an opportunity right now to legalize

119
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:22,500
marijuana in Washington state legalize

120
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:25,560
regulate and task now there's a lot of

121
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:28,019
idealists that don't like i-502 because

122
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:29,939
it's got a lot of limits on it I'll tell

123
00:04:28,019 --> 00:04:31,859
you we got to get this thing through the

124
00:04:29,939 --> 00:04:35,040
electorate and there's only one way to

125
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:37,379
do that and that is to be practical and

126
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,840
pragmatic and recognize and acknowledge

127
00:04:37,379 --> 00:04:43,139
the legitimate fears in the electorate

128
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:45,839
because to be honest you guys don't vote

129
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:47,100
like the frightened people do we need to

130
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:49,019
vote and we need to present them

131
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:52,979
something that's not so scary and that's

132
00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:56,879
what I 502 does we need to work together

133
00:04:52,978 --> 00:04:59,039
to make marijuana not a criminal issue

134
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:01,560
just like the prohibition of alcohol was

135
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:05,220
overthrown we can do that with marijuana

136
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:07,439
I am a hard-working kid raising Church

137
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:10,320
going tax paying citizen of the United

138
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:12,180
States of America and if I go home after

139
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:15,120
a long day working I want to smoke a

140
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:17,418
joint that is my civil liberty

141
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,418
foreign

142
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:30,440
happy travels even if you're just

143
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:30,439
staying home thank you
