1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:06,719
I first came here in 1994 I believe and

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:10,719
I brought this board which is the first

3
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:13,718
modern hemp board that was made uh of

4
00:00:10,718 --> 00:00:16,640
MDF that was made at Washington State

5
00:00:13,718 --> 00:00:20,239
University's labs in 19

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:24,278
9992 so literally we we brought through

7
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:26,799
the first real modern uh product at the

8
00:00:24,278 --> 00:00:29,960
highest level of cred credibility way

9
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:32,239
back then and Washington the state of

10
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:34,359
Washington has been involved ever since

11
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:36,759
as far as I'm

12
00:00:34,359 --> 00:00:40,119
concerned now the truth though it is

13
00:00:36,759 --> 00:00:43,199
like you say we still can't grow it here

14
00:00:40,119 --> 00:00:46,399
but I will also say that while I was

15
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:49,199
doing this work the first

16
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:52,520
experimental uh contract was given to

17
00:00:49,198 --> 00:00:54,839
the first Canadian farmer to grow hemp

18
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:58,559
there was a Proviso in the contract and

19
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:01,600
it allegedly said that they had to take

20
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:04,558
the actual raw star and make a finished

21
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:07,560
production prototype out of it the story

22
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:10,519
I'm told is that 20 guys signed up all I

23
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:13,359
know is the stocks I arranged to have

24
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:17,798
the stocks sent to our lab at Washington

25
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:21,118
State we created a board with their

26
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:23,400
stocks we sent it back to them and when

27
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:25,840
the farmer put that board in the hand of

28
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,600
the Canadian government representative

29
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,439
hemp became legal in

30
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:33,399
Canada so Washington is directly

31
00:01:30,438 --> 00:01:35,919
involved Washington state in the

32
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:37,879
legalization of hemp and Canada and

33
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:41,680
supposedly that's how it

34
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:44,199
happened now I did this all because I

35
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:47,520
wanted to make a product that would show

36
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:49,879
to the whole population what hemp could

37
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:52,640
do and what we could do in the area of

38
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:56,239
building materials and to save our

39
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:59,920
forest the problem is that this takes

40
00:01:56,239 --> 00:02:01,239
domestic growing this takes where we

41
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,478
want to put the factory right in the

42
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:05,879
middle of the field we don't have that

43
00:02:03,478 --> 00:02:05,879
yet
