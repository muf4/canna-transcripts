1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,600
you know there's two things I really

2
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:05,119
have to say no matter else what else we

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:10,839
want to cover on this program I have to

4
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:14,440
say uh the first thing is that um that

5
00:00:10,839 --> 00:00:16,759
uh I will not be a part of a system that

6
00:00:14,439 --> 00:00:19,358
continues to deny this very best of

7
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:22,439
God's medicines does to the hundreds of

8
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:25,118
thousands of Kian who suffer under

9
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:27,439
diagnosed ailments and categories of

10
00:00:25,118 --> 00:00:29,518
illnesses and impairments on which

11
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:32,039
marijuana is proven to be the very best

12
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:34,799
relief on Earth yeah by God it is

13
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:37,039
obscene to me to disallow these people

14
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:38,959
with tumors and anorexia associated with

15
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:40,640
nutrition blocking diseases and these

16
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,640
people for which it's the best medicine

17
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,039
and and these nausea patients for which

18
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,079
it's the best medicine those folks who

19
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:48,320
are taking cancer treatment radiation or

20
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,359
or chemotherapy and the people suffering

21
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,320
from wide angle glycom and the people

22
00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:55,519
suffering from distress and despair and

23
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:57,439
depression and the people who sometimes

24
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,559
don't think life's worth living and and

25
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:01,759
the people who uh uh who need a tonic

26
00:00:59,558 --> 00:01:03,959
for life who need to commune with Mother

27
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:06,118
Earth and they get ill and they're sick

28
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,519
because of it the empyema people the

29
00:01:06,118 --> 00:01:11,400
people with epilepsy neural disorders

30
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:14,000
like multiple sclerosis I mean it is

31
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,880
obscene to me to continue to deny these

32
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,560
people this very best medicine that

33
00:01:15,879 --> 00:01:20,000
could offer him relief in the next 5

34
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:22,159
minutes offer relief in the next 5

35
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,640
minutes you know kenty's got the lowest

36
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:27,079
life expectancy of any state in the

37
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:29,960
Union by God how can anybody who knows

38
00:01:27,078 --> 00:01:32,798
what I just said is true be a part of

39
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:36,719
any system that does not allow people

40
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:39,118
this access the we are forced to deal

41
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:41,039
with the pharmaceutical monopolies and

42
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:44,718
it's only in the name of their prophets

43
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,439
or our people being denied a much more

44
00:01:44,718 --> 00:01:50,158
restful and much more comfortable and

45
00:01:46,438 --> 00:01:53,478
enjoyable life on this planet and uh I'm

46
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,680
going to bring that insight to Kentucky

47
00:01:53,478 --> 00:01:56,920
it's going to become part of the

48
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:59,439
Kentucky psyche it's going to become

49
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:01,118
part of kuy's healing and Kentucky is

50
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:03,279
going to be been known as a center of

51
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:06,959
healing because people are going to come

52
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:10,919
there to find out what it's like to take

53
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:13,639
a much slower Pace to the Garden be uh

54
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:15,359
Gatewood some of your constituents and

55
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:18,199
some of your opponents I'm sure are very

56
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:21,200
curious that when elected how do you

57
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:23,159
plan to implement the hemp crop into the

58
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:25,280
economy into the working force into the

59
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:26,639
industry well there's there's three ways

60
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,280
to do it I don't know if it can be done

61
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:30,399
smoothly or not you know these are some

62
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:33,120
very ruthless monopolies we're SE to go

63
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,560
into a legitimate competition with okay

64
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,759
they run whole governments and whole

65
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,800
dictators and they slay thousands of

66
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:41,158
peasants every year around the globe and

67
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,000
uh I'm I'm sure that they're willing to

68
00:02:41,158 --> 00:02:44,878
do anything try to destabilize me what

69
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,120
I'm trying to do in that state I'd be

70
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:48,719
foolish to consider it in any other way

71
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:52,360
but there's some things that they cannot

72
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:55,039
stop me from doing there that uh what we

73
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:57,560
ought to do is construct a plan based

74
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:59,799
along the alcohol and tobacco production

75
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:01,479
and marketing techniques that way no one

76
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,400
could point to any segment of that plan

77
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:05,119
and say that won't work because it's

78
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:07,000
already in working either production of

79
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,519
alcohol and tobacco and distribution of

80
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,280
of those and and alcohol and I think

81
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,239
that I think marijuana belongs in those

82
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,360
categories I I think marijuana belongs

83
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:17,360
in those categories I don't think

84
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,599
there's any doubt about that uh any

85
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,519
problems with it certainly ought to be

86
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:22,679
associated with uh Social Services

87
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:25,039
rather than law enforcement you know and

88
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:27,280
and I found people who attribute some of

89
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:30,158
their malfunctioning marijuana you know

90
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,039
it's just not for everybody uh but uh I

91
00:03:30,158 --> 00:03:36,199
I just hadn't met many people it wasn't

92
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:38,280
for uh but I want the farmer to produce

93
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:39,479
it under license I first of all I think

94
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,560
every household ought to be able to grow

95
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:43,878
their own I mean your relationship with

96
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:46,360
Mother Earth is the most fundamental

97
00:03:43,878 --> 00:03:47,919
thing uh it's even more biological than

98
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:50,200
your birth parents because they're made

99
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:52,438
of the same carbons and the same Earthly

100
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:53,919
products as as you are and it all came

101
00:03:52,438 --> 00:03:56,120
from Mother Earth you know that's where

102
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:57,359
we came up from in my opinion uh smoking

103
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,680
marijuana is the closest thing to

104
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,799
communing with Mother Earth next to

105
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:05,159
eating the pound of mud as far as I

106
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:07,280
know uh the uh you

107
00:04:05,158 --> 00:04:09,679
know but you don't feel as good after to

108
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,000
eat that pound of mud next morning I

109
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,400
mean don't eat pounds of mud folks cause

110
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,199
you to lose work and government Bush

111
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,478
will come out President Bush will come

112
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:21,798
out and anti mud

113
00:04:17,478 --> 00:04:24,000
hysteria um but uh what I want to do is

114
00:04:21,798 --> 00:04:26,719
you get to grow your own I mean bye

115
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,399
golly our ability to plant a seed in

116
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,680
God's green earth and can do what we

117
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:31,079
want to with the green natural plant

118
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,959
comes up out of it is the most

119
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:34,879
fundamental pursuit of life liberty and

120
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:37,279
pursuit of happiness and one has to be

121
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:39,199
one of the most inalienable rights and

122
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:41,478
in guarantees at least within the per

123
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,000
number of the Constitution or at least

124
00:04:41,478 --> 00:04:45,399
within the substance of due process

125
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,959
causes of the Constitution think so uh

126
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:48,959
you know and uh so you ought to be able

127
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:50,599
to do that that's where I draw the line

128
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:53,719
people say gab why not crack cocaine and

129
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:56,919
heroin well first of all uh they those

130
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:58,440
substances I understand seem to override

131
00:04:56,918 --> 00:04:59,879
the freedom of choice if you want to set

132
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:01,478
those things down after long used and

133
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:03,600
try to walk away from him they call you

134
00:05:01,478 --> 00:05:05,918
back that's very one of the way Richard

135
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,400
Pryor ways Richard Pryor talked about

136
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:09,240
crack it just kept calling it back you

137
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:11,159
know he couldn't quit it you know said

138
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,800
Richard you know and he just had to come

139
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:14,280
back to it the marijuana I don't know

140
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,639
anybody it's just you can lay it down

141
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:18,159
and go away and do whatever you want to

142
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:20,680
you know and and it doesn't bother you

143
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,000
so if it's a green natural plant uh then

144
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,680
my God you ought to be able to grow it

145
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,918
if you want to rub poison iy all over

146
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,000
your body by gu you be able to poison

147
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:30,439
all over your body from nature whatever

148
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,519
you want to do like we go out and we

149
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:34,680
license the farmers to grow a certain

150
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:36,519
pound each allotment okay now you know

151
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,639
uh I'm advising every stock broker in

152
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:40,959
the state to advise their clients to buy

153
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,680
stocking chain link fence companies

154
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:44,279
because uh because when these farmers

155
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:46,600
get to grow this stuff that you're going

156
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:51,079
to see these little chain link enclaves

157
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:52,800
on every one of kuy's 86,000 farms okay

158
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:55,038
personally I'm start my own company

159
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,879
there you go but uh but farmer those

160
00:05:55,038 --> 00:05:58,879
Farm see Kentucky has more Farms than

161
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:00,319
any other state in the Union besides for

162
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:02,399
okay I mean you wouldn't think of from

163
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:05,000
the size of it but I mean and the farm

164
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:07,120
size is only 1/5 the national average

165
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,360

teing I go around with I mean it's

people sitting behind bars who have no

262
00:09:15,278 --> 00:09:18,679
right as far as the government is

263
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:20,799
concerned to express their opinions and

264
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:23,319
their voices and they cannot be heard

265
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:26,120
but as Gatewood has said these people

266
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:28,000
