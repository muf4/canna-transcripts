1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,399
how y'all doing out there Portland

2
00:00:04,519 --> 00:00:08,718
Oregon so let me start off by telling

3
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:11,239
you a little bit about myself I have

4
00:00:08,718 --> 00:00:13,558
muscular distrophy I was diagnosed at

5
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:16,480
the age of three in my first electric

6
00:00:13,558 --> 00:00:19,799
chair by the age of five I was known as

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:21,880
a pothead people ever understood that uh

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,920
I needed certain things to make my days

9
00:00:21,879 --> 00:00:27,960
go well when I uh learned that I wasn't

10
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:28,960
a pothead I was a medicator I was free

11
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,960
from the

12
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:35,000
world

13
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:37,840
so you know we have uh women children

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,079
men out there that are dying because

15
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,760
they cannot get this plant they cannot

16
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,280
have free access to the meds they need

17
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:46,799
they are not able to get themselves out

18
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:50,439
of bed they are not able to maintain a

19
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:53,799
family life because the government says

20
00:00:50,439 --> 00:00:56,759
we are wrong you all feel we are wrong I

21
00:00:53,799 --> 00:01:01,078
don't I think we all deserve the right

22
00:00:56,759 --> 00:01:03,518
to be free and to uh take the medicine

23
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:07,879
we need to help us relieve our

24
00:01:03,518 --> 00:01:11,319
lifestyles and pains whether it be PTSD

25
00:01:07,879 --> 00:01:13,640
Tremors stomach aches whatever if you

26
00:01:11,319 --> 00:01:16,199
know it's your medicine you deserve the

27
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,200
right to use

28
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:21,359
it

29
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:24,679
um it's just uh to me it's just really

30
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:28,078
sad that that people are dying and

31
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:30,360
people have to fight for it I if you

32
00:01:28,078 --> 00:01:32,438
cannot have access to your medicine

33
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:34,478
what are you going to do you you go you

34
00:01:32,438 --> 00:01:36,519
fight you fight you fight just to tell

35
00:01:34,478 --> 00:01:39,319
be told you're going to die it's not

36
00:01:36,519 --> 00:01:42,118
right you know we we have the access we

37
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:43,359
need to make it right for everybody so

38
00:01:42,118 --> 00:01:47,840
I'm going to wrap it up make it real

39
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:51,000
kind of quick and simple medical social

40
