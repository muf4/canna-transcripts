1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,769
global warming is a real thing and so is

2
00:00:02,459 --> 00:00:06,509
legalization in Oregon and I have to

3
00:00:04,769 --> 00:00:08,879
admit that it hasn't played out the way

4
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:11,609
that I hoped it would I was hoping that

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,860
they would follow what the law as we

6
00:00:11,609 --> 00:00:16,919
wrote it not rip it to shreds and

7
00:00:13,859 --> 00:00:19,589
especially not endanger our medical

8
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,810
marijuana program and so here's my

9
00:00:19,589 --> 00:00:24,570
challenge for every one of you today I

10
00:00:21,809 --> 00:00:26,879
follow a lot of you on facebook and I

11
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:29,160
see you out there complaining about what

12
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:31,140
you don't like about how things are

13
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:34,020
playing out and I want you to know that

14
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,939
you have the opportunity every time you

15
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:38,160
post one of those things on Facebook you

16
00:00:35,939 --> 00:00:40,769
can send it to your representative and

17
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:43,019
let them know how you feel too you can

18
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:45,090
send it to the committee that's making

19
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:47,969
these rules most of what you have never

20
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:50,969
smoked a joint in their lives much less

21
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:54,329
have a clue about how the plan works for

22
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:56,489
the rest of us let them know to stop

23
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:59,520
posting it on Facebook send it to your

24
00:00:56,488 --> 00:01:02,099
representatives nobody cares on facebook

25
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,829
facebook is not real people your

26
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:06,659
representatives are real you can find

27
00:01:04,829 --> 00:01:09,150
them in the time it takes you to write

28
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:12,810
one of those posts and you can send that

29
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:15,240
note via email or my favorite thing to

30
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:17,368
do call their office number on a Sunday

31
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:19,438

32
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:22,200

34
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,659
medical marijuana program save the

35
00:01:24,629 --> 00:01:29,129
60,000 plus people who are registered

36
00:01:26,659 --> 00:01:31,979
save our children who need this medicine

37
00:01:29,129 --> 00:01:33,599
and stop the over-regulation and

38
00:01:31,978 --> 00:01:36,420
ridiculousness that they're trying to

39
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:38,669
pull with legalization I'm pissed off

40
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:41,849
still and I've been fighting this fight

41
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:45,530
for 15 years and I'll find it for 15

42
00:01:41,849 --> 00:01:48,899
more until these people get it right and

43
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:51,000
you guys can do help me do that and it's

44
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:52,829
going to take all of us I don't care

45
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,688
