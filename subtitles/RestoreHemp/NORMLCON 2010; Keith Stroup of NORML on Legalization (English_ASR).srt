00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:05,599
I first smoked pot 45 years ago when I

3
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:08,399
was a freshman at Georgetown Law School

4
00:00:05,599 --> 00:00:10,960
in Washington DC and I've been a regular

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,638
smoker ever since. There is nothing

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:16,880
wrong with the responsible use of

7
00:00:13,638 --> 00:00:20,600
marijuana. It was 40 years ago next

8
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:23,118
month that normal was formed. And at the

9
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:25,279
time, and so we've been at this now for

10
00:00:23,118 --> 00:00:28,480
four decades. And our position then and

11
00:00:25,278 --> 00:00:30,879
our position now is there's absolutely

12
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,960
nothing wrong with responsible use of

13
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:34,719
marijuana by adults and it should be of

14
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,558
no interest or concern to the

15
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:39,280
government. They have no they have no

16
00:00:36,558 --> 00:00:42,599
business knowing whether we smoke or why

17
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,600
we smoke.

18
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,520
As Allan mentioned in his opening

19
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,000
comments, we really are at a tipping

20
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,840
point in this country. There are more

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,840
living Americans who have smoked

22
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:58,079
marijuana than living Americans who have

23
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:00,480
not. And with the increasing support we

24
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:03,439
have from the public now, we've made

25
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:07,599
more political progress in the last five

26
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:09,920
years than in the first 35. So folks, we

27
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:11,438
are very close to winning this. Closer

28
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,280
than it looks like when you're out

29
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:15,759
struggling on the street level. I

30
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,118
understand. But once change begins, it

31
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,469
happens more quickly than you

32
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:20,750
anticipate.

33
00:01:18,469 --> 00:01:20,750
