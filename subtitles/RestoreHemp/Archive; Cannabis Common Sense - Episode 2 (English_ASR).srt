three chief testers and I'd like to

Oregon cannabis Tax Act here in Oregon

15
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:11,060
our initiative will tax and regulate the

16
00:01:08,509 --> 00:01:14,090
sales of marijuana through Oregon's 280

17
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:15,829
state liquor stores you know through the

18
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:18,200
state liquor stores the age limit is

19
00:01:15,828 --> 00:01:21,408
strictly enforced so only people over

20

the age of 21 will be purchasing it the

21
00:01:21,409 --> 00:01:25,460
oregon cannabis Tax Act will allow

22
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:27,950
doctors to prescribe marijuana to

23
00:01:25,459 --> 00:01:29,839
patients through pharmacies so that

24
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:31,759
people who need marijuana when they're

25
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:36,380
sick or ill for various ailments

26
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:42,009
everything from glaucoma and to combat

27
00:01:36,379 --> 00:01:45,318
the way a the aids wasting syndrome to

28
00:01:42,009 --> 00:01:48,159
fighting the effects of chemotherapy in

29
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:51,019
relation to its use to stop cancer

30
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:53,118
marijuana helps in all of those cases it

31
00:01:51,019 --> 00:01:56,179
will also allow farmers here in Oregon

32
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:58,368
to grow him for fiber protein and oil

33
00:01:56,179 --> 00:02:02,629
and make everything from textiles and

34
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:04,638
rope to paper and from food to energy we

35
00:02:02,629 --> 00:02:06,769
believe that the Oregon cannabis Tax Act

36
00:02:04,638 --> 00:02:08,689
by legalizing industrial hemp will

37
00:02:06,769 --> 00:02:11,090
create thousands of sustainable jobs

Oregon cannabis Tax Act will raise

54
00:02:54,709 --> 00:02:59,000
hundreds and millions of dollars in

55
00:02:56,329 --> 00:03:00,799
state revenue ninety percent of that

56
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,199
money will go into the state general

57
00:03:00,799 --> 00:03:07,459
fund to lower the tax burden on us all

58
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:09,649
the other 10% is split among eight

59
00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:11,780
percent for drug abuse treatment

60
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:13,639
programs so that people have substance

61
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:15,829
abuse problems with alcohol or other

62
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:17,810
drugs can get the help they need when

63
00:03:15,829 --> 00:03:19,310
they need it currently about ninety

64
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:21,530
percent of those people are turned away

65
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:23,449
the Oregon cannabis tax act will

66
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:26,120
increase funding for people looking for

67
00:03:23,449 --> 00:03:28,219
help with substance abuse problems by a

68
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:32,989
factor of at least 10 and perhaps as

69
00:03:28,219 --> 00:03:34,728
much as thirty one percent of the

70
00:03:32,989 --> 00:03:37,459
proceeds from the Oregon cannabis Tax

71
00:03:34,729 --> 00:03:40,449
Act will go to create a educational

72
00:03:37,459 --> 00:03:42,829
program for kids in grade schools and

73
00:03:40,449 --> 00:03:44,659
secondary schools so that they can find

74
00:03:42,829 --> 00:03:46,400
out the real dangers that substance

75
00:03:44,658 --> 00:03:48,378
abuse might pose to their development

76
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,049
the final 1 percent would go into

77
00:03:48,378 --> 00:03:54,590
creating a state Agriculture Committee

78
00:03:51,049 --> 00:03:58,879
that would promote Oregon hemp fiber

79
00:03:54,590 --> 00:04:02,000
protein and oil that committee would be

80
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:05,810
funded by the proceeds from the sales of

81
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,209
marijuana you know marijuana is useful

82
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:11,709
as a medicine in fact the oldest medical

83
00:04:08,209 --> 00:04:15,378
texts the and Cara vada from

84
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:18,620
north-central India about five to six

85
00:04:15,378 --> 00:04:21,139
thousand years ago listed marijuana is

86
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:23,538
one of the primary medicines and today a

87
00:04:21,139 --> 00:04:26,629
lot of research has been done around the

88
00:04:23,538 --> 00:04:29,089
world that proves that cannabis and in

89
00:04:26,629 --> 00:04:32,269
various constituents in marijuana are

90
00:04:29,089 --> 00:04:35,538
useful in treating various medical

91
00:04:32,269 --> 00:04:38,598
ailments one of those agents in cannabis

92
00:04:35,538 --> 00:04:40,399
is tetrahydrocannabinol ik acid that's

93
00:04:38,598 --> 00:04:44,000
THC and

94
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:47,529
GHC has been synthesized and isolated in

95
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:51,319
a capsule form called Maron all are

96
00:04:47,529 --> 00:04:53,299
technically Travon all that product is

97
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:56,149
useful in turn and it's the main

98
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:59,360
psychoactive product in cannabis it's

99
00:04:56,149 --> 00:05:01,279
useful in stimulating appetite but it's

100
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:05,169
not the only active substance in

101
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:09,500
cannabis there's also CBD cannabidiol

102
00:05:05,168 --> 00:05:12,560
and cannabinoid e all is useful for

103
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:14,839
treating spasms it's anti [ __ ] agent

104
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:18,769
and that's completely separate use for

105
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:22,459
from THC that's why marijuana in its

106
00:05:18,769 --> 00:05:23,870
vegetable form is useful for PMS

107
00:05:22,459 --> 00:05:26,029
patients patients with multiple

108
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:27,889
sclerosis because it helps stop their

109
00:05:26,029 --> 00:05:30,109
spasms and helps them control that

110
00:05:27,889 --> 00:05:32,210
there's also another pharmaceutically

111
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:34,669
active substance in cannabis that isn't

112
00:05:32,209 --> 00:05:38,538
psychoactive at all and that's Canepa

113
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:40,788
chroming RCBC canna backrow mean is an

114
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:44,918
anti-inflammatory agent which is why

115
00:05:40,788 --> 00:05:50,659
cannabis in its raw vegetable form is

116
00:05:44,918 --> 00:05:56,120
useful for arthritis and any other

117
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:59,449
inflammation of the joints or problems

118
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:01,280
along that line so cannabis is a very

119
00:05:59,449 --> 00:06:03,949
useful medicine with several different

120
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:08,348
medicinal compounds and this the pill

121
00:06:03,949 --> 00:06:11,030
form THC or Maranatha is not completely

122
00:06:08,348 --> 00:06:14,029
effective medicine for everything that

123
00:06:11,029 --> 00:06:16,519
cannabis can treat you know the Oregon

124
00:06:14,029 --> 00:06:18,978
cannabis Tax Act will allow doctors to

125
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:23,359
prescribe cannabis through pharmacies

126
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:27,680
and that will be it cost so the cost of

127
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:30,050
medical cannabis will be just a few

128
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,658
pennies on the dollar compared to the

129
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:34,310
recreational cannabis the cannabis sold

130
00:06:32,658 --> 00:06:37,219
in the state liquor store system to

131
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:39,319
adults over the age of 21 will be taxed

132
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:42,349
and that money the revenue from that tax

133
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:44,538
will go to the state general fund and to

134
00:06:42,348 --> 00:06:47,538
help with drug education and drug

135
00:06:44,538 --> 00:06:50,689
treatment but the medical cannabis won't

136
00:06:47,538 --> 00:06:52,339
be taxed in fact adults or any sick

137
00:06:50,689 --> 00:06:53,990
person would be allowed to grow their

138
00:06:52,339 --> 00:06:56,448
own you know currently

139
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:58,189
the THC pills which at once again only

140
00:06:56,449 --> 00:07:02,030
have one active agent from cannabis

141
00:06:58,189 --> 00:07:05,000
those THC pills are six dollars each for

142
00:07:02,029 --> 00:07:06,379
a person who has AIDS or multiple

143
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,529
sclerosis that has to take them

144
00:07:06,379 --> 00:07:13,788
regularly that's $30,000 a year in

145
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:16,250
medics just medicine costs now if that

146
00:07:13,788 --> 00:07:18,649
cannabis was grown commercially without

147
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:21,709
the black-market in place the way it has

148
00:07:18,649 --> 00:07:22,819
inflated the prices today the amount of

149
00:07:21,709 --> 00:07:24,379
money that would be needed for that

150
00:07:22,819 --> 00:07:26,839
person's medicine for an entire year

151
00:07:24,379 --> 00:07:30,978
would be about 50 dollars compared to

152
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:33,439
the 30 thousand just using THC Marinol

153
00:07:30,978 --> 00:07:35,300
pills you know for the people who are

154
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:39,348
undergoing chemotherapy they have

155
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:40,970
violent nausea for over a week for the

156
00:07:39,348 --> 00:07:43,399
people who have the AIDS wasting

157
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:47,630
syndrome or have multiple sclerosis and

158
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:49,459
can't keep down those $6 pills sometimes

159
00:07:47,629 --> 00:07:52,430
they'll take one pill and they'll throw

160
00:07:49,459 --> 00:07:55,489
it up two or three times before they can

161
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:58,340
keep it down well and it takes up to an

162
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:59,900
hour and a half to go into effect so

163
00:07:58,339 --> 00:08:01,759
they take this pill they throw it up a

164
00:07:59,899 --> 00:08:03,769
couple times finally they keep one down

165
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,658
and then it goes into effect about an

166
00:08:03,769 --> 00:08:08,930
hour and a half later and that's at six

167
00:08:05,658 --> 00:08:11,509
dollars a pill about a nickels worth of

168
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:15,408
cannabis one or two deep inhalations and

169
00:08:11,509 --> 00:08:18,529
it acts instantaneously the war on drugs

170
00:08:15,408 --> 00:08:20,240
is not about drugs at all the war on

171
00:08:18,529 --> 00:08:22,269
drugs is about money

172
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:25,340
and the continued centralization of

173
00:08:22,269 --> 00:08:30,038
economic and political control the war

174
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:33,439
on drugs continues to centralize

175
00:08:30,038 --> 00:08:36,139
economic control we see huge amounts of

176
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:38,539
money just in the Marinol industry going

177
00:08:36,139 --> 00:08:41,120
to pharmaceutical companies instead of

178
00:08:38,538 --> 00:08:43,069
going out to farmers and out it's a

179
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:47,149
decentralized sources to spread the

180
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:49,010
wealth to us all the pharmaceutical

181
00:08:47,149 --> 00:08:52,240
company has a huge interest in keeping

182
00:08:49,009 --> 00:08:54,980
this Marinol and the the synthetic

183
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:58,490
pharmaceutical product out there you can

184
00:08:54,980 --> 00:09:01,909
see at $30,000 a year let's say there

185
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:04,159
are a thousand people here in the

186
00:09:01,909 --> 00:09:07,278
Portland area alone and that's probably

187
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:11,179
an underestimate that need to take that

188
00:09:07,278 --> 00:09:13,999
and so that right there is thirty

189
00:09:11,179 --> 00:09:16,188
million dollars a year just from that

190
00:09:13,999 --> 00:09:17,509
one market here in Portland multiply

191
00:09:16,188 --> 00:09:19,578
that by the rest of the United States

192
00:09:17,509 --> 00:09:22,959
and you can see why the pharmaceutical

193
00:09:19,578 --> 00:09:25,909
industry is against the sales of

194
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:27,849
marijuana as a medicine they can't make

195
00:09:25,909 --> 00:09:32,240
the money off of it that they can off

196
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:35,600
these synthetic drugs and the synthetic

197
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:39,409
drugs have side effects that the organic

198
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:43,009
ones don't you know marijuana has never

199
00:09:39,409 --> 00:09:46,370
in human history ever caused a lethal

200
00:09:43,009 --> 00:09:49,519
overdose we see the effects of alcohol

201
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:52,578
we see the effects of valium we see the

202
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:54,769
effects of many other pharmaceutical

203
00:09:52,578 --> 00:09:57,378
drugs and how many thousands of people

204
00:09:54,769 --> 00:09:59,600
die each year here in the United States

205
00:09:57,379 --> 00:10:02,028
from the use of pharmaceutical drugs

206
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:05,649
where marijuana has not caused a single

207
00:10:02,028 --> 00:10:08,448
lethal overdose in recorded history

208
00:10:05,649 --> 00:10:10,999
marijuana in fact is one of the safest

209
00:10:08,448 --> 00:10:14,508
drugs known to man there's an article

210
00:10:10,999 --> 00:10:18,350
from The Lancet which is one of

211
00:10:14,509 --> 00:10:22,639
Britain's oldest medical magazines The

212
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:23,089
Lancet it's been published for over 400

213
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:26,240
years

214
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:29,000
it's the oldest english-language medical

215
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:32,480
text and in their editorial from last

216
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:35,750
November of 1995 just a little over a

217
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:38,990
year ago they said in their editorial d

218
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:41,750
glamourizing cannabis that the use of

219
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:45,470
cannabis the smoking of cannabis even

220
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:47,269
long-term is not harmful to health now

221
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:49,850
you know many people tell us that

222
00:10:47,269 --> 00:10:51,919
marijuana is a dangerous drug but here

223
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:54,800
we have the oldest peer-reviewed medical

224
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:57,438
journal in the world saying that the

225
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:59,928
smoking of cannabis even long-term is

226
00:10:57,438 --> 00:11:03,909
not harmful to health why do these

227
00:10:59,928 --> 00:11:07,610
doctors say this when the industry's and

228
00:11:03,909 --> 00:11:09,169
people who are control our economic and

229
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:11,720
political systems here in United States

230
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:15,110
tell us differently they have an

231
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:17,720
economic incentive to do so and we want

232
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:20,028
to stop that we want to put economic

233
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,840
control back where it belongs you know

234
00:11:20,028 --> 00:11:22,700
we

235
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:25,070
think that the government has abdicated

236
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:27,170
its responsibility to control this

237
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:30,800
market the government has a

238
00:11:27,169 --> 00:11:33,379
responsibility to control the sales of

239
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:35,649
marijuana and we think the Oregon

240
00:11:33,379 --> 00:11:38,059
cannabis Tax Act will do that it will

241
00:11:35,649 --> 00:11:38,720
force the government to take control

242
00:11:38,059 --> 00:11:40,909
back

243
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,009
currently they've abdicated control to

244
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:44,839
the black market the people in the black

245
00:11:43,009 --> 00:11:48,110
market who are controlling it outside of

246
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:49,580
a few small a few small number of people

247
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:52,690
at the top who are making the most money

248
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:56,660
people who control it by and large are

249
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:58,670
children and substance abusers we want

250
00:11:56,659 --> 00:12:01,250
to take control out of the hands of kids

251
00:11:58,669 --> 00:12:03,049
and substance abusers and put it back in

252
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:05,330
the liquor store so the government can

253
00:12:03,049 --> 00:12:07,669
control the sales and make certain that

254
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:10,400
it's only going to those over the age of

255
00:12:07,669 --> 00:12:11,899
21 you know currently by putting

256
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,750
children and substance abusers in

257
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:17,659
control of the market we put these drugs

258
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:19,759
in the hands of kids who are selling

259
00:12:17,659 --> 00:12:22,370
them in the classroom we look back at

260
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:25,240
alcohol prohibition we see that during

261
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:28,879
alcohol prohibition kids were selling

262
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:31,639
gin whiskey rum they were selling these

263
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:33,610
various products in the schools in fact

264
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:37,909
back during alcohol prohibition from

265
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:40,039
1917 to 1933 entire schools closed down

266
00:12:37,909 --> 00:12:40,969
for a day because everybody in the

267
00:12:40,039 --> 00:12:43,279
school was drunk

268
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:45,560
well that doesn't happen today but we do

269
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:48,919
see the effects of weapons and fighting

270
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:53,179
over control of the markets for these

271
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:57,229
illegal drugs we think that marijuana in

272
00:12:53,179 --> 00:13:01,659
the black market is dangerous for our

273
00:12:57,230 --> 00:13:04,850
youth and in fact you know we think that

274
00:13:01,659 --> 00:13:06,829
marijuana is not a gateway drug that in

275
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:09,259
fact it's a gateway the black market and

276
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:12,410
this article in the British Medical

277
00:13:09,259 --> 00:13:15,230
Journal from December of 1995 just a

278
00:13:12,409 --> 00:13:18,500
year ago shows how that in fact is the

279
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:22,310
case in their article called the war on

280
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:25,429
drugs league prohibition isn't working

281
00:13:22,309 --> 00:13:29,089
some legalization will help they said

282
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:31,549
that the use of marijuana by minors in

283
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:33,230
the Netherlands is roughly less than a

284
00:13:31,549 --> 00:13:34,429
fifth what it is here in the United

285
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:36,590
States

286
00:13:34,429 --> 00:13:39,139
the thing that's amazing about that is

287
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:41,780
that in the Netherlands they allow the

288
00:13:39,139 --> 00:13:44,389
sales of marijuana to anyone over the

289
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:48,289
age of 16 through the Netherlands coffee

290
00:13:44,389 --> 00:13:50,330
shops here in the United States

291
00:13:48,289 --> 00:13:52,789
marijuana is completely prohibited in

292
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:54,290
the Netherlands since 1976

293
00:13:52,789 --> 00:13:57,559
they've allowed the sales of marijuana

294
00:13:54,289 --> 00:14:00,079
to anyone over the age of 16 but the use

295
00:13:57,559 --> 00:14:04,219
of marijuana by those between the ages

296
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:06,590
of 17 and 18 is less than one-fifth less

297
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:08,509
than 20% what it is here in the United

298
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:11,930
States where it's completely prohibited

299
00:14:08,509 --> 00:14:14,419
marijuana isn't the gateway drug but

300
00:14:11,929 --> 00:14:17,059
marijuana prohibition is the gateway to

301
00:14:14,419 --> 00:14:19,129
the black market we believe by taking

302
00:14:17,059 --> 00:14:21,229
marijuana out of the black market and

303
00:14:19,129 --> 00:14:24,080
letting the government control its sales

304
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:26,000
that the use of marijuana will decline

305
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:27,800
and the use of all other drugs will

306
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,250
decline as well this same British

307
00:14:27,799 --> 00:14:34,069
Medical Journal article says the use of

308
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:36,950
hard drugs such as cocaine and heroin by

309
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:39,200
minors in the Netherlands is less than

310
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:42,890
1/10 what it is here in the United

311
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:45,259
States less than 10% so clearly what the

312
00:14:42,889 --> 00:14:48,850
Dutch are doing is working and we want

313
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:54,350
Oregon to emulate that policy you know

314
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:56,300
just in the last few months in this

315
00:14:54,350 --> 00:15:00,670
November the state of California passed

316
00:14:56,299 --> 00:15:05,059
Proposition 215 proposition 215

317
00:15:00,669 --> 00:15:09,799
has allowed patients in California to

318
00:15:05,059 --> 00:15:13,039
use marijuana to combat various

319
00:15:09,799 --> 00:15:14,809
illnesses including glaucoma for which

320
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:18,099
it lowers the inter ocular pressure

321
00:15:14,809 --> 00:15:21,169
thereby saving people's eye sight for

322
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:26,029
the wasting syndrome associated with

323
00:15:21,169 --> 00:15:27,439
AIDS or cancer chemotherapy in fact a

324
00:15:26,029 --> 00:15:31,309
study in the Journal of Clinical

325
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:34,910
Oncology a cancer publication they

326
00:15:31,309 --> 00:15:37,009
surveyed all oncologists cancer doctors

327
00:15:34,909 --> 00:15:40,429
here in the United States they found

328
00:15:37,009 --> 00:15:43,069
that 42% of all oncologists had

329
00:15:40,429 --> 00:15:46,639
recommended marijuana to their patients

330
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:48,528
even though it's illegal and 48% of

331
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:50,600
those physicians

332
00:15:48,528 --> 00:15:54,889
said that they would recommend marijuana

333
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:57,769
if in fact it was medicinally available

334
00:15:54,889 --> 00:16:00,860
and 56% of them said that they thought

335
00:15:57,769 --> 00:16:02,600
marijuana was useful medication to

336
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:06,919
combat the side effects from

337
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:09,949
chemotherapy to treat AIDS you know

338
00:16:06,919 --> 00:16:14,509
currently here in the United States we

339
00:16:09,948 --> 00:16:17,870
have a system where medical patients are

340
00:16:14,509 --> 00:16:19,610
arrested for marijuana we should ask

341
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:23,419
ourselves this question who should

342
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:26,600
decide what medicine is best for a

343
00:16:23,419 --> 00:16:28,399
patient should it be the patients should

344
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:30,319
it be the doctors who are deciding what

345
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:33,259
medicine is good for patients or should

346
00:16:30,318 --> 00:16:36,289
it be law enforcement today we put law

347
00:16:33,259 --> 00:16:39,079
enforcement in charge of that fact in an

348
00:16:36,289 --> 00:16:45,558
article from the San Francisco Journal

349
00:16:39,078 --> 00:16:48,588
just last a week as we tape this show in

350
00:16:45,558 --> 00:16:52,879
January perhaps a little bit later as

351
00:16:48,589 --> 00:16:56,329
it's being shown just they just reopened

352
00:16:52,879 --> 00:17:00,558
the cannabis buyers club in San

353
00:16:56,328 --> 00:17:02,269
Francisco because of proposition 215 you

354
00:17:00,558 --> 00:17:06,139
know the Attorney General in the state

355
00:17:02,269 --> 00:17:09,019
of California dan lundgren went in with

356
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:12,259
hundreds of officers and closed down the

357
00:17:09,019 --> 00:17:15,828
cannabis buyers club last September he

358
00:17:12,259 --> 00:17:17,929
did that to send a political message to

359
00:17:15,828 --> 00:17:22,788
try to stop the passage of proposition

360
00:17:17,929 --> 00:17:27,259
215 well recently a court judge issued

361
00:17:22,788 --> 00:17:29,000
an injunction to stop the closure of the

362
00:17:27,259 --> 00:17:32,148
buyers club and the buyers club is

363
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:35,890
reopened and now they are legally with

364
00:17:32,148 --> 00:17:40,308
the courts blessing selling cannabis to

365
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:42,649
patients who have a medical need you

366
00:17:40,308 --> 00:17:44,898
know here in Oregon there are some brave

367
00:17:42,648 --> 00:17:47,989
people who are operating a buyer's club

368
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:51,139
to help patients that have a doctor's

369
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:53,779
order we think that that shouldn't be

370
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:55,100
that way in fact there's a legislature

371
00:17:53,779 --> 00:17:57,319
here in Portland in the state

372
00:17:55,099 --> 00:18:00,399
legislature as our oregon oregon

373
00:17:57,319 --> 00:18:04,149
legislative session starts George Amy

374
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:07,330
and his last name is spelled e i GH m ey

375
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:10,860
George amy is introducing a medical bill

376
00:18:07,329 --> 00:18:15,329
so the legislature might enact a

377
00:18:10,859 --> 00:18:17,649
medicinal cannabis provision so that

378
00:18:15,329 --> 00:18:22,240
patients can receive the cannabis they

379
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:28,720
need in fact went back in California

380
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:30,960
when they passed prop 215 one of the

381
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:34,630
things that influenced them was

382
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:38,970
Doonesbury Gary Trudeau in his

383
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:42,010
doonesbury comic-strip began to lambast

384
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:44,350
the Attorney General dan lundgren and

385
00:18:42,009 --> 00:18:48,190
dan lundgren actually responded and

386
00:18:44,349 --> 00:18:51,339
asked that somehow the newspaper be made

387
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:55,140
to stop putting out dooms Barry's

388
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:58,049
cartoon you know Bill Clinton is

389
00:18:55,140 --> 00:19:00,670
lambasted as are many politicians by

390
00:18:58,049 --> 00:19:02,889
Doonesbury and various cartoonists very

391
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:05,590
few of them ever pay attention and say

392
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:08,650
to stop but Len Lundgren actually said

393
00:19:05,589 --> 00:19:11,019
that it they that they should stop

394
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:13,150
printing the doonesbury cartoon and one

395
00:19:11,019 --> 00:19:14,740
of his spokesperson even went so far as

396
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:16,210
to say that they think they should

397
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:18,549
arrest the cartoon characters in

398
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:23,950
Doonesbury let just shows the extent to

399
00:19:18,549 --> 00:19:26,769
which the drug warriors will go to fight

400
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:28,960
this war because to them it's not an

401
00:19:26,769 --> 00:19:31,269
issue about drugs it's an issue about

402
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,279
money though the officers who are

403
00:19:31,269 --> 00:19:36,789
benefitting from this make a lot of

404
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:39,460
money they have a lot of power they

405
00:19:36,789 --> 00:19:41,259
seize a lot of objects that the

406
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:44,890
government sells and brings more money

407
00:19:41,259 --> 00:19:47,009
to the government's coffers here in

408
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:49,780
Portland when they arrest someone

409
00:19:47,009 --> 00:19:52,210
they'll often only prosecute people who

410
00:19:49,779 --> 00:19:55,180
have equity in their home and they will

411
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:57,279
seize that equity so that they can based

412
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:59,170
on just a few small plants in a person's

413
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:01,329
home they can come in and seize their

414
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:03,250
equity and their life savings and the

415
00:20:01,329 --> 00:20:05,319
people count themselves lucky if they're

416
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:07,660
not put in jail you know a good

417
00:20:05,319 --> 00:20:11,139
percentage of these people are doing

418
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:14,500
this for medical need and we need

419
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:16,780

a lot of publicity lately for instance

00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:25,270
here is the cover of Time magazine where

441
00:21:22,329 --> 00:21:28,509
they're talking about the increased use

442
00:21:25,269 --> 00:21:30,400
and increased awareness of cannabis in

443
00:21:28,509 --> 00:21:32,470

445
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:39,130
California dan lundgren doesn't like

446
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:43,500
that too much but you can see that it is

447

00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:20,019
another magazine here the nation a

460
00:22:17,319 --> 00:22:21,549
progressive magazine with a long history

461
00:22:20,019 --> 00:22:25,019
here in the United States and you can

462
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:27,690
see that they say the war is over and

463
00:22:25,019 --> 00:22:30,509
drugs win the drug war is a colossal

464
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:33,990
failure of unprecedented proportions

465
00:22:30,509 --> 00:22:36,390
it's been fought for an incredibly long

466
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:38,809
time at the cost of billions and

467
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:42,540
billions of dollars and it's a failure

468
00:22:38,809 --> 00:22:45,299
we want to stop that failure we want to

469
00:22:42,539 --> 00:22:47,940
lower the costs associated with

470
00:22:45,299 --> 00:22:50,069
enforcing these crazy laws you know

471
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:52,380
we've been tracking convictions and

472
00:22:50,069 --> 00:22:54,689
incarcerations here in the state of

473
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:57,240
Oregon been tracking them over about a

474
00:22:54,690 --> 00:23:00,799
period of a year and a half we found

475
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:03,900
that a little bit more than 55% of all

476
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:05,909
convictions and incarcerations in the

477
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:09,930
penitentiary here in the state of Oregon

478
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:11,790
are for marijuana are for drugs 55% of

479
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:14,220
those and half of those are a little bit

480
00:23:11,789 --> 00:23:16,889
more than 25 percent are just for

481
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:19,860
marijuana alone the cost associated with

482
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:22,080
this are enormous it cost tens of

483
00:23:19,859 --> 00:23:25,349
thousands of dollars to incarcerate

484
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:27,720
these people every year cost hundreds of

485
00:23:25,349 --> 00:23:29,009
thousands of dollars to arrest them take

486
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:31,170
them through the court process and

487
00:23:29,009 --> 00:23:34,500
prosecute them then we have to spend

488
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:36,240
millions and even billions of dollars to

489
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:38,190
build new prisons the way we're doing

490
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,890
here in the state of Oregon you know

491
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:43,380
we're can increase our prison population

492
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:46,590
according to the newspaper The Oregonian

493
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:50,040
over the next ten years from an article

494
00:23:46,589 --> 00:23:53,220
on March 30th of 1996 the prison

495
00:23:50,039 --> 00:23:55,710
population will increase by a factor of

496
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:58,380
a hundred and fifty eight percent in the
