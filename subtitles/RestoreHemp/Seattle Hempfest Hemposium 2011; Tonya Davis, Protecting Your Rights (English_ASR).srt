1
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:07,120
I believe that any

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:09,400
effort to bring compassion to

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:12,879
Ohio is a good

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:15,800
thing um I am a medical marijuana

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:19,679
patient in the state of Ohio like Donnie

6
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:21,760
said and I support all

7
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:24,239
efforts being

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,760
made to bring

9
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:31,959
compassion

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:31,960
um I am a patient in an illegal state

11
00:00:32,118 --> 00:00:36,759
and we got to make the difference we've

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,679
got to stop that and we've got to make

13
00:00:36,759 --> 00:00:42,079
it to where I don't have to be afraid

14
00:00:38,679 --> 00:00:42,079
for using making a

15
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:50,480
Tre I

16
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:51,878
I it makes no sense to me you know folks

17
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:55,599
need

18
00:00:51,878 --> 00:00:57,039
to get a grip and quit being so afraid

19
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:01,920
of a

20
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:01,920
plant uh we've got housef 24

21
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:09,200
in Ohio uh it was uh introduced by state

22
00:01:06,438 --> 00:01:12,239
representative kennyo and state

23
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,240
representative Bobby

24
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:18,359
Hagen so Ohio's got a lot of exciting

25
00:01:15,478 --> 00:01:21,359
things going on right now you know we're

26
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:23,478
trying to do it legislative wise which

27
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:27,478
I've been begging for the

28
00:01:23,478 --> 00:01:31,799
last seven years to get our legislators

29
00:01:27,478 --> 00:01:32,879
to stand up so now we got two different

30
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:36,880
very

31
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:39,399
different um Constitutional Amendments

32
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:43,879
that we are trying to get introduced as

33
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:46,280
well uh because one way or another Ohio

34
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:49,078
is going to get it whether we get our

35
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:51,478
legislators to do it or whether we bring

36
00:01:49,078 --> 00:01:53,879
it to the people because Ohio ones are

37
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:55,560
tired of being

38
00:01:53,879 --> 00:02:01,000
ignore

39
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:01,000
um two weeks ago I was hospitalized

40
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:07,439
with calcium deposits on my brain they

41
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:10,439
did a CAT on in all that my brain is

42
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:12,159
covered what I found come to find out

43
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:15,039
over the past few years that I've been

44
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:16,199
in this activism and in this movement is

45
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:19,239
that

46
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:21,759
marijuana uh or cannabis or pot or

47
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:26,159
whatever you call it or choose to call

48
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:27,639
it um is actually a neuroprotectant and

49
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:31,560
an

50
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:34,559
antioxidant and it can protect

51
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:37,000
what brain I've got that isn't damaged

52
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,840
from the uh calcium deposits that's

53
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:44,199
surrounding my brain right

54
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:46,759
now uh so I don't have cancer I I I

55
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:49,679
can't go get

56
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:52,878
chemotherapy so this fight has even

57
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:55,879
become even more personal because now

58
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:58,439
it's a life or death situation I knew

59
00:02:55,878 --> 00:03:00,679
that with my big old long list of uh

60
00:02:58,439 --> 00:03:01,840
health conditions and stuff that

61
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,599
cannabis

62
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,400
treated a lot of those

63
00:03:04,598 --> 00:03:10,280
symptoms

64
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:14,319
but now it can actually protect what

65
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:16,959
brain I've got left so what I'm hoping

66
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:20,399
to do is is get folks on a national

67
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:22,199
level to stand up and do what's right

68
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:26,719
because right now I think it's y'all

69
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:26,719
that's going to save my life

70
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:32,878
um your brain controls everything and I

71
00:03:30,158 --> 00:03:36,878
think I should deserve a

72
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:41,479
chance at fighting for my

73
00:03:36,878 --> 00:03:41,479
life even though our government says

74
00:03:42,629 --> 00:03:52,919
[Applause]

75
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:52,920
no they wouldn't lie to us though would

76
00:03:53,158 --> 00:03:59,798
they abely you know they own

77
00:03:56,479 --> 00:04:01,959
patents on canab anoid as neuro

78
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:05,000
protectants and antioxidants and they've

79
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:05,000
had that since

80
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:13,799
2003 how dare them to deny

81
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:17,519
anyone the right to use something that's

82
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:20,519
safe as aspir safer than aspon

83
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,519
actually

84
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:27,240
um I have enough problems with my

85
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:29,918
health

86
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:33,319
that I shouldn't have to worry about

87
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:35,560
being prosecuted and terrified

88
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:37,599
terrorized by our local law enforcement

89
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:40,519
or even our federal law

90
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:45,199
enforcement

91
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:47,879
so the house bill 214 the Ohio medical

92
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:53,038
uh cannabis Act of

93
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:55,000
2012 the AL Ohio alternative treatment

94
00:04:53,038 --> 00:04:58,639
Amendment

95
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:01,079
um I I I'd say that's progress for Ohio

96
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:03,280
I'd say that we're moving in the right

97
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:06,599
direction and

98
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:07,918
um so keep us in your prayers keep us in

99
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:11,720
