i i've been working on

7

working with in industrial m for over 20

8
00:00:14,558 --> 00:00:20,000
years and specifically on the political

9
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:22,079
side of it for about the last 13 with

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,320
vote hemp and i got to tell you it's

11
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:26,559
been a long hard slog when we started

12
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,160
this we thought oh yeah you'll probably

13
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:29,439
have this legalized in five years or

14
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,039
something and

15
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,558
here we are 13 years later and we're

16
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,800
still uh you know

17
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:36,879
pushing hard so uh it's really nice to

18
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:38,399
sort of see how things are things are

19
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,399
changing and we're starting to get into

20
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,640
the mainstream and out of the uh

21
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:46,160
you know in the very beginning ron paul

22
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:48,159
was our our first uh uh co-sponsor of a

23
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:48,878
hemp legislation interestingly and he

24
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:50,878
was

25
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:52,079
he did it at the request of ralph nader

26
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:53,359
believe it or not

27
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,119
and uh

28
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:57,600
anyways nobody really wanted to work

29
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:59,280
with ron paul back in 2005. i think you

30
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,439
may have been one of our first 10 or 15

31
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,198
co-sponsors back in the day but

32
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:05,039
i also want to thank the entire oregon

33
00:01:03,198 --> 00:01:07,200
delegation because really you guys are

34
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,799
very fortunate here you have a uh you

35
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,000
know a lot of leadership here senator

36
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:15,118
wyden has led in the senate uh everyone

37
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,640
in the delegation is uh with the

38
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:18,239
exception of representative walden as a

39
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,159
co-sponsor and representative senator

40
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:22,798
walden did vote for the uh

41
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:25,200
the farming amendment that was on the

42
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,920
farm bill so oregon has been a real you

43
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,000
know leader state on this issue

44
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,159
i also wanted to mention and just

45
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,159
recognize senator berzansky his state

46
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,400
senator here who led here in the state

47
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:38,000
legislature and got

48
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,759
him passed and he put the bill up a

49
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,478
number of times i think at the request

50
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:43,840
of carol moran and maybe jerry shapiro

51
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:46,319
down in eugene

52
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,840
and uh first it took you know two or

53
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:49,758
three sessions never got through in any

54
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,799
case he finally finally pulled it off

55
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,879
and so that's part of the reason we're

56
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,320
here today as well with oregon being one

57
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:56,078
of the ten states that actually has it

58
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:58,559
authorized in their state law

59
00:01:56,078 --> 00:02:00,399
and then as uh representative blumenar

60
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,000
mentioned this this memo this is really

61
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,478
fantastic because we've been working for

62
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,840
years to get the justice department to

63
00:02:04,478 --> 00:02:07,519
take a look at this you know other

64
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,000
states have tried to approach them about

65
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:11,598
this and this is the first u.s attorney

66
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,959
to make a public statement on this and

67
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:15,280
this is huge

68
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,280
um so i mean we're very excited about

69
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,800
this and this kind of opens the door for

70
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,878
the department of agriculture and other

71
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,719
officials here in the state to say okay

72
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:24,479
now we've got a clear guideline for how

73
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:26,560
this can work and how what we have to do

74
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:28,878
in order to make it possible for farmers

75
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,280
to grow him

76
00:02:28,878 --> 00:02:32,560
i will just reiterate a couple of things

77
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,039
uh

78
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,598
the farm bill amendment that passed

79
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:41,039
was by not only bipartisan we had 63

80
00:02:37,598 --> 00:02:42,159
republicans and 162 democrats

81
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:43,519
i don't think you can find too many

82
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:46,159
bills that are passing the house right

83
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:47,920
now that kind of a bipartisan support it

84
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:49,519
was incredible and we were just you know

85
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:51,598
really thankful for the group that

86
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,200
brought that forward and

87
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:55,439
um

88
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:56,958
but i do want to emphasize that this is

89
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:58,800
only a first step this research

90
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,640
amendment is only going to it's going to

91
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,439
it's going to crack the door open but we

92
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:06,000
have got to get we've got a bill in the

93
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:08,878
house h.r 525 and the building senate

94
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,719
s359 and we have got to get those bills

95
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:12,639
passed and get this put permanently into

96
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:14,239
law so that hemp is no longer confused

97
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:16,318
with marijuana and farmers have a clear

98
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,158
path to grow it because even with this

99
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:21,039
research amendment and this memo we're

100
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:22,878
still in a you know quasi you know

101
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:24,799
legal situation and it's going to still

102
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:26,639
make it difficult for for farmers to go

103
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,760
forward so um

104
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:29,439
just a couple other things real quick

105
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:30,798

106
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:32,400
