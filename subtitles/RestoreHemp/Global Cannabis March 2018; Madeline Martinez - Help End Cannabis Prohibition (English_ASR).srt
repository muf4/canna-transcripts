8
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:26,879
trip to Pioneer Courthouse where we're

9
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:30,660
standing in Portland's living room and

10
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:34,140
we're talking about legalizing marijuana

11
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:35,969
d scheduel izing because you know we

12
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,469
legalized in the state but they're still

13
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:40,200
screwing with us

14
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:43,200
they're still messing with our law and

15
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:45,870
they're still putting roadblocks in the

16
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:49,109
middle of everything there's this

17
00:00:45,869 --> 00:00:53,909
there's this actual language legislation

18
00:00:49,109 --> 00:00:57,780
called the indoor clean air act and I

19
00:00:53,909 --> 00:01:01,558
call it insidious it is destroying the

20
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:04,680
fabric of the language that we pass

21
00:01:01,558 --> 00:01:07,950
measure 91 it's just coming in there and

22
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:11,610
destroying it we cannot have we cannot

23
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:13,890
have lounges why why can't we have a

24
00:01:11,609 --> 00:01:16,469
place where we can go meet up with a

25
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:19,560
friend take a couple of puffs enjoy a

26
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:22,079
sandwich and then move on with our lives

27
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,450
there is no reason and you know what I'm

28
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:26,819
not coming down on cigars but if they

29
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:28,019
can have a cigar bar and now they're

30
00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:32,099
trying to tell me

31
00:01:28,019 --> 00:01:36,599
that marijuana's too toxic too toxic

32
00:01:32,099 --> 00:01:40,048

50
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:37,350

51
00:02:33,629 --> 00:02:39,419
power of the vajayjay and you ladies you

52
00:02:37,349 --> 00:02:41,819
