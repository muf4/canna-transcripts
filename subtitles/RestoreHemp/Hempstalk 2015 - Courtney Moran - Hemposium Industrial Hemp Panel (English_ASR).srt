1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
we need to stop regulating based on th d

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:06,210
concentrations this is completely

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,919
arbitrary scientists have shown through

4
00:00:06,209 --> 00:00:10,609
their studies that regulating based on

5
00:00:07,918 --> 00:00:12,660
tht is an arbitrary especially the 0.3%

6
00:00:10,609 --> 00:00:14,459
what we should be doing what I've been

7
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:16,890
advocating for is regulating based on

8
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:20,189
cannabinoid profile such as a THC CBD

9
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:22,109
ratio and that would look at the true

10
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:23,939
psycho activity of the plan and the

11
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:25,529
symbiotic relationship of all the

12
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:27,420
cannabinoids and the terpenes within the

13
00:00:25,528 --> 00:00:30,778
plants that we can be using this as a

14
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:32,850
whole plant approach and using each each

15
00:00:30,778 --> 00:00:35,579
type of cannabis for the best use that

16
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:37,950
it does have not limiting our plant to a

17
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:41,128
0.3% when you know studies have shown

18
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:44,399
that the 0.3% is limiting the production

19
00:00:41,128 --> 00:00:47,369
of seed and oil etc so here in Oregon

20
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:49,259
2015 was our first production season and

21
00:00:47,369 --> 00:00:53,878
we had nine farmers cultivating this

22
00:00:49,259 --> 00:00:56,128
year harvest started about yes nine

23
00:00:53,878 --> 00:00:57,659
farmers it was incredible one of our

24
00:00:56,128 --> 00:01:03,628
farmers is actually right there Eric M

25
00:00:57,659 --> 00:01:05,459
savings we did have some issues with

26
00:01:03,628 --> 00:01:07,408
seed importation this past year that's

27
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:09,329
why we only had 90 phone of our farmers

28
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:11,219
planting but you're looking forward to a

29
00:01:09,329 --> 00:01:14,009
more product product successful

30
00:01:11,219 --> 00:01:15,900
production season in 2016 harvest began

31
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:17,460
about three weeks ago and some of our

32
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:21,049
farmers are still harvesting this week

33
00:01:17,459 --> 00:01:21,048
as we're going very cool
