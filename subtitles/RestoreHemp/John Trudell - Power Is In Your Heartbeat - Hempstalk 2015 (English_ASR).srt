1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:06,278
uh you know cuz we're in

2
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:07,839
a we're in a situation in we're in a

3
00:00:06,278 --> 00:00:10,000
dimensional reality now we're pretty

4
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:12,719
much you got to pretty much improvise as

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,839
we go along you know and to and to

6
00:00:12,718 --> 00:00:17,559
really be able to effectively improvise

7
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:20,960
as we go along we need to be able to do

8
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:24,598
it with respecting the

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:26,679
clarity respecting our our intelligence

10
00:00:24,599 --> 00:00:27,920
you know we need to be able to do it

11
00:00:26,678 --> 00:00:29,639
with Clarity because they're

12
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,320
with our minds they their mind

13
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,719
us so that we can't see we don't know

14
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,840
anymore so everybody's just afraid

15
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:38,280
that's it that's reality reality is a is

16
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,680
fear you know everybody's being mindfuck

17
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:43,320
through that fear so no you know and so

18
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:45,679
everybody's going around reactionary

19
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,119
these be reactionary Behavior patterns

20
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:48,359
they're really are the same thing that's

21
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:49,599
going on but they've convinced

22
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:52,359
themselves they're doing something

23
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:56,640
different am I making

24
00:00:52,359 --> 00:01:00,079
sense all right see so see so if there's

25
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:03,039
going to be any real change right but we

26
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:06,640
got to understand to respect our

27
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:09,400
intelligence see and and we need it's

28
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:14,040
very important it's very very important

29
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:17,040
that we learn how to like ourselves this

30
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,799
is the most important thing of all cuz

31
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,359
see if you don't like yourself then what

32
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,600
the good you're going to do for the

33
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:24,759
rest of the world when it really comes

34
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:26,559
down because I don't like

35
00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:29,719
my no

36
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:31,960
offense meant but see gu what I mean we

37
00:01:29,719 --> 00:01:34,438
need need to think cuz there's too much

38
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:37,078
muddled going on here that's getting in

39
00:01:34,438 --> 00:01:38,758
the way of us having the lives that we

40
00:01:37,078 --> 00:01:42,959
that we are entitled

41
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:44,718
to and especially with what's coming see

42
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:46,839
not my generation I'm of the generation

43
00:01:44,718 --> 00:01:48,718
we're booking we're going you know we we

44
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:52,000
we get to go on and do our other the

45
00:01:48,718 --> 00:01:54,319
rest of our stuff but what's come in

46
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,478
here it's very

47
00:01:54,319 --> 00:02:00,038
important that the next that we need to

48
00:01:57,478 --> 00:02:02,078
understand to like ourselves to respect

49
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:04,280
our intelligence cuz we can talk

50
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:06,399
spirituality all we want we can talk

51
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:08,919
good guy stuff all we want but if we

52
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:12,560
don't like ourselves what does it mean I

53
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:14,958
mean seriously seriously and now back to

54
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,840
the part about liking

55
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:20,400
ourselves see and and to me don't like

56
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,039
ourselves see it's if we're full of fear

57
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,800
doubt and insecurity and we just think

58
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:25,919
we're up you know then that means

59
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:29,439
we don't like ourselves but but what my

60
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:30,359
point being if you look at at reality

61
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:34,878
with

62
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:37,560
it somebody put that in our mind see

63
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:40,919
what see somebody said it to us somebody

64
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:43,239
told it to us we didn't think that up

65
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:47,000
ourselves am I making

66
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:48,719
sense all right see so so and it's very

67
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,439
important for us to understand that

68
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:54,239
somebody that wanted to control us and

69
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:56,959
feed off of us put this fear see and the

70
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,239
fear starts with we don't like ourselves

71
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,158
because we don't think we're good

72
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,680
however they put it in there however

73
00:03:00,158 --> 00:03:04,798
however ver whatever version of that

74
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:07,879
virus we carry but our intelligence is

75
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:10,920
the antibiotic

76
00:03:07,878 --> 00:03:13,280
anyway whatever goes

77
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:14,798
on keep clear

78
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,959
mind

79
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:20,959
know I power is

80
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:20,959
very

81
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:30,598
power power comes from

82
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:32,119
us and how we use a clear mind

83
00:03:30,598 --> 00:03:34,359
yeah cuz I don't know sometimes I get

84
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:36,120
confused cuz I am multi-dimensional

85
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:40,840
sometimes and I

86
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:44,560
am I am crazy you know and and and I

87
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:47,799
don't trust any of you normal at

88
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,799
all no

89
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,438
offense because you don't understand

90
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,799
what power

91
00:03:53,438 --> 00:03:57,878
is power is in your

92
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:59,920
heartbeat all right power is in your

93
00:03:57,878 --> 00:04:02,560
heartbeat

94
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:04,598
power is in your heartbeat it sends

95
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,598
electrical energy and your brain

96
00:04:04,598 --> 00:04:10,518
transmits electrical energy through what

97
00:04:06,598 --> 00:04:13,798
is called thought that's power all right

98
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:15,959
that's power we are our own

99
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:18,680
power all right

100
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:21,759
this all the rest of

101
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:23,959
it whatever it is

102
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,919
right but

103
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:31,120
power comes from

104
00:04:26,918 --> 00:04:33,159
us money is about Authority not power

105
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,160
politics is about Authority military is

106
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:37,439
about Authority so all these religion

107
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:41,160
it's all about Authority all right but

108
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:43,719
we've been but we believe see we don't

109
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:45,880
think any anyway we've been programmed

110
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:48,639
to believe that these things represent

111
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:51,680
power but in reality they represent

112
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:54,639
forms of authority power is an entirely

113
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:57,000
different thing see but in the in in the

114
00:04:54,639 --> 00:05:01,639
land of Deceit slight of mind and

115
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,639
illusion and delusion we get confused

116
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:05,918
used okay
