00:00:02,158 --> 00:00:08,009
mean green cream i'm also a patient

3
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:10,559
activist here in oregon for many years

4
00:00:08,009 --> 00:00:12,710
we here in oregon have been leaders in

5
00:00:10,558 --> 00:00:15,718
the nation when it comes to cannabis

6
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:18,660
today i can no longer say that we're

7
00:00:15,718 --> 00:00:22,528
necessarily the leaders do to our

8
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:25,379
lawmakers OHA an olcc we have slipped

9
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:29,039
from the forefront position and we're

10
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:31,589
starting to slide we as individuals we

11
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:35,939
as citizens need to come together and

12
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:38,159
step forward and make our voice known it

13
00:00:35,939 --> 00:00:40,049
is up to us the people to make the

14
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:43,319
changes in our state's of the we are the

15
00:00:40,049 --> 00:00:46,109
leaders in the forefront of a changing

16
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:48,719
nation and a changing world we have

17
00:00:46,109 --> 00:00:50,579
other countries now like Australia that

18
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,859
is looking to the United States for

19
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:55,198
guidance do we want to give them wrong

20
00:00:52,859 --> 00:00:56,960
guidance I for sure do not want to

21
00:00:55,198 --> 00:01:00,030
because I am a fourth generation

22
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:04,170
Oregonian some of the things that really

23
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:06,420
bother me is the packaging yes we need

24
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:08,760
packaging but no we do not need /

25
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,920
regularization on the packaging we have

26
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:14,840
been a green state before a green state

27
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:19,228
with popular we need to keep it that way

28
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:21,210
patients access is necessary a patient

29
00:01:19,228 --> 00:01:25,560
takes upwards of twenty one thousand

30
00:01:21,209 --> 00:01:27,658
milligrams or greater in their body to

31
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,879
be able to have a semblance of order and

32
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:33,719
be able to have a normal life that you

33
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:37,908
and I take for granted these truths we

34
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:41,310
hold evidence as marijuana consumers as

35
00:01:37,909 --> 00:01:44,070
cannabis consumers that it helps us with

36
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:47,090
our everyday life it helps us come out

37
00:01:44,069 --> 00:01:51,750
and be sociable and socialize for PTSD

38
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:53,579
it helps it helps it helps the only ones

39
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:54,930
that are not helping are the ones in

40
00:01:53,578 --> 00:01:58,618
this building because they do not

41
00:01:54,930 --> 00:02:01,880
understand a policy made from ignorance

42
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:04,590
is not a policy it is a fear-based

43
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:07,048
legislation we all need to tell our

44
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:10,460
friends that we have 15 minutes right

45
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:11,960
each in front of our legislators

46
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:14,920
each one of us need to make those

47
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:19,219
appointments make our voices heard and

48
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:21,949
we as cannabis activists can now become

49
00:02:19,219 --> 00:02:24,680
cannabis leaders in a nation and in the

50
00:02:21,949 --> 00:02:27,439
world that is changing it is up to each

51
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:30,230
and every single one of us not the

52
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:33,949
people in this building it is up to you

53
00:02:30,229 --> 00:02:38,929
and me and every other citizen and

54
00:02:33,949 --> 00:02:41,329
Oregon to do right by and for organ we

55
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:43,849
need to stand up for each individual

56
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:45,920
patients and their rights in the last

57
00:02:43,849 --> 00:02:48,229
meeting they already said we are the

58
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:51,530
train has already left I'm not messing

59
00:02:48,229 --> 00:02:54,649
with the medical program well we need to

60
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:57,140
find a reverse and we need to back that

61
00:02:54,650 --> 00:03:02,330
back up into that station and realize

62
00:02:57,139 --> 00:03:04,939
that patients have rights and doctors

63
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:07,610
need to understand that patients have a

64
00:03:04,939 --> 00:03:09,590
voice and they should not choose and

65
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:13,220
between their pharmaceutical medicines

66
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:16,969
and a plant that is available on every

67
00:03:13,219 --> 00:03:19,520
single continent on this earth God gave

68
00:03:16,969 --> 00:03:22,069
us a plant on every single continent

69
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:23,900
that goes for every single person on

70
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:26,329
this earth and if we aren't supposed to

71
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:32,270
use it then we should be putting God in

72
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:34,700
jail not us let us make sure that we do

73
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:36,860
right by the united states and by our

74
00:03:34,699 --> 00:03:39,069
country thank you very much for your

75
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:39,070
time
