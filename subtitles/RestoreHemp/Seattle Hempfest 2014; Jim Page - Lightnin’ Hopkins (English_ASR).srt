1
00:00:03,379 --> 00:00:08,399
the song I wrote about my hero

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:10,919
my musical hero everybody got a musical

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,859
hero Michael Bob Marley my name Bob

4
00:00:10,919 --> 00:00:15,500
Dylan everybody's got a musical hero

5
00:00:12,859 --> 00:00:17,879
I've had a whole bunch of them my time

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:19,920
but we got to matter the most to me when

7
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:22,759
I was coming up and learning how to play

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,900
a guitar with Sam Hopkins

9
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:27,560
they call it a lightning that was a

10
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:27,559
professional land

11
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:33,600
from Texas to a little town called

12
00:00:31,018 --> 00:00:35,699
Centerville Texas

13
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:39,058
a little small town not a minute here in

14
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:42,020
Seattle up with the old fresh air Tavern

15
00:00:39,058 --> 00:00:42,019
and this is what happened

16
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:59,359
no one could sing the blues like

17
00:00:56,698 --> 00:00:59,359
lightning Hopkins

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,659
up again

19
00:01:07,459 --> 00:01:11,219
that's when I heard him for the first

20
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:14,479
time

21
00:01:11,219 --> 00:01:18,658
cutting into the noise of the car

22
00:01:14,478 --> 00:01:20,158
and my whole world went upside down I

23
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:23,100
just had to learn to sing and play

24
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:25,259
guitar so I got on my bicycle with a

25
00:01:23,099 --> 00:01:28,500
high-rise handle ballrooms and I would

26
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:30,478
ride for 20 miles on a run I got every

27
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:34,159
one of his records I could find back in

28
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:34,159
yes I did I had 11 of them

29
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:41,420
I never learned to play the blues

30
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:45,118
I hope that's all right

31
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:48,000
I never learned to play the moon but I

32
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:49,319
could sing and play a guitar on

33
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,519
oh

34
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:54,839
now I use later up in Seattle town

35
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:55,798
lightning came to playing three nights

36
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,359
in a row

37
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:58,820
I caught it with him early in the

38
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:01,700
dressing room

39
00:01:58,819 --> 00:02:04,379
somehow I just had to live alone

40
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:07,259
so once you got my guitar and I started

41
00:02:04,379 --> 00:02:08,419
playing and I'm beating him up a song to

42
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:11,459
celebrate

43
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:13,919
by the radio at the car and all of his

44
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:16,739
records and I'm glad I was to meet him

45
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:19,500
at night when I think about what he

46
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:21,180
taught me without even knowing it and

47
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:25,199
all the lessons that I still had to

48
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:29,840
learn and lightning use his dream when I

49
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:29,839
was done he told me a story every time

50
00:02:32,598 --> 00:02:38,959
I hope that's all right

51
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:38,959
I never learned

52
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:47,459
that this is what he told me he said he

53
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:50,340
was walking around in Texas one time he

54
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:53,420
was only 12 years old he was carrying

55
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:57,000
his guitars almost as big as he was he

56
00:02:53,419 --> 00:02:58,939
tired of marine cold we saw some people

57
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,739
were having a picnic

58
00:02:58,939 --> 00:03:03,900
man he has the biggest thing for his

59
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:06,599
meal okay turn him away he said because

60
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:09,840
he was too raggedy you can still

61
00:03:06,598 --> 00:03:11,280
remember how it made him feel he looked

62
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,219
after the distance to his dark

63
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:17,400
sunglasses and he grinned a little more

64
00:03:14,219 --> 00:03:20,900
just a chance he said now I got money in

65
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,900
the bank back home

66
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:32,719
I hope that's all right

67
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:32,719
I never learned

68
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:37,159
oh man I guess again

69
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:42,300
foreign

70
00:04:41,579 --> 00:04:45,800
relaxing guitar on

71
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,560
foreign
