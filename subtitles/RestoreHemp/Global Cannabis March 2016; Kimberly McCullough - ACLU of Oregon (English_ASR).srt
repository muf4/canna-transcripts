3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:11,400
gorgeous day for the 17th annual global

4
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:13,320
cannabis March my name is Kimberly

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,240
McCullough I'm the legislative director

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,310
with the American Civil Liberties Union

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,368
just for some of you who may not know

8
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:22,768
who the ACLU is we are a nonpartisan

9
00:00:20,368 --> 00:00:24,809
organization debt is dedicated to

10
00:00:22,768 --> 00:00:27,479
advancing civil rights and civil

11
00:00:24,809 --> 00:00:29,698
liberties our national organization is

12
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,980
almost a hundred years old and our

13
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:35,039
Oregon affiliate is celebrating our 60th

14
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:38,189
anniversary this year we work on a broad

15
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:41,509
range of issues many of which intersect

16
00:00:38,189 --> 00:00:44,128
with the ongoing need for drug reform in

17
00:00:41,509 --> 00:00:46,649
1973 we supported legislation to make

18
00:00:44,128 --> 00:00:48,659
Oregon the first state to decriminalize

19
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:52,820
possession of small amounts of marijuana

20
00:00:48,659 --> 00:00:56,250
in the 1990s we beat back attempts to

21
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:58,049
recriminate craft the successful ballot

22
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:00,780
measure that created organs medical

23
00:00:58,049 --> 00:01:03,119
marijuana program we're grateful to have

24
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:05,700
also been part of the measure 91

25
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:07,798
campaign and we continue to be involved

26
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:10,200
in this work because we want organs

27
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:12,810
experience with legal marijuana to be a

28
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:17,280
successful model for other states and to

29
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:19,560
lead to federal reform but I don't want

30
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,500
to just talk to you about marijuana

31
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,780
today I also want to talk about the

32
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:27,329
decades-long drug war that has ensnared

33
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:30,478
millions of people into America's

34
00:01:27,329 --> 00:01:33,239
criminal justice system our society and

35
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:35,429
our government made a huge mistake when

36
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:38,959
we decided to regulate certain drugs

37
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:42,060
like marijuana through prohibition

38
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:46,589
criminalization decriminalization and

39
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:48,960
stigma instead of dealing with drugs as

40
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:52,049
a public health issue we set in motion

41
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:54,780
machinery that deeply eroded fundamental

42
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:57,270
rights crucial to our democracy tore

43
00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:00,149
families apart and locked people in

44
00:01:57,269 --> 00:02:02,879
cages well we've made incredible

45
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:04,978
progress legalizing marijuana in Oregon

46
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:08,008
the truth is that so much of the drug

47
00:02:04,978 --> 00:02:10,110
wars machinery is still operating the

48
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:12,500
impact it's made and continues to make

49
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:15,500
will take a huge amount of work to

50
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,500
rectify

51
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:22,200
so how do we get there how do we get to

52
00:02:19,378 --> 00:02:24,840
finishing drug reform or two more drug

53
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:27,479
reform that we need we need to shift the

54
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:29,968
narrative and change our culture instead

55
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:32,009
of talking about being tough on crime we

56
00:02:29,968 --> 00:02:34,979
need to talk about being smart on crime

57
00:02:32,009 --> 00:02:37,138
and being smart on crime means that we

58
00:02:34,979 --> 00:02:40,608
know that dealing with drugs as a

59
00:02:37,139 --> 00:02:42,889
criminal issue doesn't make any sense

60
00:02:40,609 --> 00:02:45,870
criminalizing drugs makes us less safe

61
00:02:42,889 --> 00:02:48,689
it pushes people that need help into the

62
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:50,879
shadows it disproportionately impacts

63
00:02:48,688 --> 00:02:52,530
the poor and people of color and it

64
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:55,378
gives power to cartels who are

65
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:57,870
terrorizing our neighbors in nations to

66
00:02:55,378 --> 00:03:00,780
the south as we shift away from

67
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:03,329
criminalization we need to instead focus

68
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:05,158
on public health our laws and our

69
00:03:03,329 --> 00:03:08,069
efforts should be aimed at promoting

70
00:03:05,158 --> 00:03:10,769
health in our society what's good for

71
00:03:08,068 --> 00:03:13,408
people who need medicine what helps

72
00:03:10,769 --> 00:03:16,650
people who have addictions and what

73
00:03:13,408 --> 00:03:19,289
actually keeps us safe and free we can't

74
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:21,479
become complacent we can't think that

75
00:03:19,289 --> 00:03:24,269
merely decriminalizing marijuana in

76
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:27,359
Oregon is enough because the damage that

77
00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:29,609
has been done is so deep even here in

78
00:03:27,359 --> 00:03:32,639
Oregon we still have marijuana reform

79
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:34,919
that needs to happen criminal penalties

80
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:37,859
for marijuana related crimes are still

81
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:40,139
too high even though alcohol is a much

82
00:03:37,859 --> 00:03:41,969
more dangerous drug criminal penalties

83
00:03:40,139 --> 00:03:44,009
that remain on the books for marijuana

84
00:03:41,969 --> 00:03:46,969
are still much higher than the same

85
00:03:44,008 --> 00:03:50,638
types of penalties for alcohol in

86
00:03:46,969 --> 00:03:53,579
addition employees in Oregon's two can

87
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:56,189
still be fired for using marijuana even

88
00:03:53,579 --> 00:03:58,469
if they're a medical patient and tenants

89
00:03:56,188 --> 00:04:01,138
in Oregon can still be evicted from

90
00:03:58,469 --> 00:04:05,310
their homes because they use or possess

91
00:04:01,139 --> 00:04:08,150
marijuana in their homes all of this

92
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:10,500
needs to change and we have to be also

93
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:12,780
vigilant in protecting our medical

94
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:14,639
marijuana patients as I mentioned

95
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:17,009
earlier the ACLU has been at the

96
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:19,829
forefront of drug reform for a long time

97
00:04:17,009 --> 00:04:21,840
and we're not stopping anytime soon my

98
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:24,658
sincere hope is that you won't stop

99
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:27,329
either so I understand that the March is

100
00:04:24,658 --> 00:04:30,300
about to start if you guys can have

101
00:04:27,329 --> 00:04:34,848
head up that way towards the beginning

102
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:34,848
of the March let's go get them
