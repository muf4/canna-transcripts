1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:08,539
this one's going on to share Parker

2
00:00:04,278 --> 00:00:08,539
my bass player for 20 years

3
00:00:08,839 --> 00:00:12,320
she was he

4
00:00:12,718 --> 00:00:19,519
kind of like a secretary Treasure of

5
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:19,519
Seattle him best for all those years

6
00:00:19,579 --> 00:00:24,198
and she lets us know that long ago

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,699
and I wrote her this song A while back

8
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:38,239
she's so fine

9
00:00:34,259 --> 00:00:42,320
got another forever

10
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:46,259
and out of time

11
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:48,320
love will die never

12
00:00:46,259 --> 00:00:48,320
mind

13
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:12,380
London

14
00:01:08,299 --> 00:01:17,280
the way she looked at me was like random

15
00:01:12,379 --> 00:01:20,179
in my mind was a room with a man I know

16
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,180
she's nosy

17
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:26,478
another forever

18
00:01:27,019 --> 00:01:35,118
in and out of time

19
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:35,118
the field I never

20
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:44,280
thought she's so fine

21
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:44,280
I'm gonna love me forever forever

22
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:30,560
that's how it is when you're in love

23
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,640
your dress

24
00:02:35,818 --> 00:02:44,119
share with her it's like nothing else

25
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:48,319
matters she's so fine

26
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:52,280
I'm a lover forever

27
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:52,280
in another time

28
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:56,360
the foot I never

29
00:02:56,419 --> 00:03:04,579
cause she's so fine

30
00:03:00,659 --> 00:03:04,579
the love of forever

31
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:12,620
forever and ever ever

32
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:12,620
today

33
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:29,719
so fine

34
00:03:25,699 --> 00:03:29,719
but it's so fine
