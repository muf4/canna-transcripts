1
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:08,638
Hi, my name is Jack Herb from an

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:11,199
organization called Hemp and uh which

3
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:13,119
has helped eliminate or end marijuana

4
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:14,320
prohibition.

5
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:16,000
We're going to show you a movie called

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,679
Hemp for Victory that was made by the

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,039
United States Department of Agriculture

8
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:25,198
in 1942 for encouraging the war effort

9
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:28,400
to grow 350,000 acres of cannabis of

10
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:30,160
hemp of marijuana cannabis sativa over

11
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:32,479
the next each year for the next three

12
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,880
years for the war. More than they had

13
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:37,599
grown in the preceding 50 years in the

14
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:40,480
United States combined, mostly importing

15
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,719
their hemp from uh the Far East and

16
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:44,319
Russia.

17
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,439
While this movie is on, you may not

18
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,439
realize that hemp was the most important

19
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:52,718
product in America and in the world. For

20
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:54,640
thousands of years, all commerce was

21
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,399
carried by hemp and sales. Indeed, the

22
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,600
word canvas, as you'll see in the movie,

23
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:02,640
comes from the Arabic word and the Dutch

24
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,478
word for uh hemp, which is canvas.

25
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,118
Canvas is a Dutch pronunciation of

26
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:08,640
cannabis.

27
00:01:07,118 --> 00:01:10,079
the movie you're about to see. For the

28
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,079
last 20 years, the United States

29
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:14,158
government says that no such movie was

30
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:15,158
ever made by any department of the

31
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,560
United States

32
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:22,880
government. that um we know that from at

33
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:25,920
least 1981 on that reporters for

34
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:28,239
magazines, newspapers have been told and

35
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,159
you'll see a you'll see actual letters

36
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:31,679
denying that this movie was ever made by

37
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,240
any department of the United States

38
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:37,040
Department of Agriculture or by any

39
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:39,759
department of the government.

40
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:43,680
uh Carl Packard, Maria Pharaoh and

41
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:44,920
myself, Jack her uh after going all

42
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,759
through

43
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:51,118
the US Department of Agriculture Library

44
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:53,920
of Beltsville, Maryland in the May uh

45
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:55,759
April and May of 1989.

46
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,799
went to the Library of Congress, motion

47
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:00,718
pictures and film strips to see if we

48
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,799
could find any documentation that this

49
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:05,839
movie that the newspapers were telling

50
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:07,200
me that I was they couldn't run as being

51
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,560
affirmed by the government that the

52
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,319
government said that they'd never made

53
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,479
this movie that I was showing to

54
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:14,079
television reporters and there were

55
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:15,840
other people activists all over the

56
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,440
country who were showing this movie and

57
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,719
were being told that this movie was

58
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:21,039
never made by the United States

59
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:22,800
government.

60
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:24,239
Uh Carl Marie and I went into the

61
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,239
Library of Congress through the motion

62
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,400
pictures and film strips and we did a

63
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,840
search with their librarians as we had

64
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,480
done at the Department of Agriculture

65
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,840
Library in

66
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:35,759
Beltzville. And we found no trace of

67
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:39,200
this movie in their electronic searches,

68
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:42,479
in their cataloges or in any of their

69
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:44,399
card files. And we were convinced that

70
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:46,560
even though we believed the movie was

71
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,840
totally genuine, that there was no

72
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,199
record and that these people weren't

73
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:53,280
deliberately lying, they just didn't

74
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:53,280
have somehow somewhere it had been

75
00:02:53,318 --> 00:02:57,958
omitted. Finally, as we were about to

76
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:00,560
leave the building after leaving the the

77
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:01,800
room where the film strips and motion

78
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,000
pictures were

79
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,280
housed, we thought, well, well, let's go

80
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,439
back and give it another try. And we

81
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,280
asked the Mrs. Katherine Longby, I

82
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:10,959
believe her name is the librarian, to

83
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,959
assist us again. And we said, "What if

84
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:13,840
we had come here 30 or 40?" We didn't

85
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,080
really know what we were going to say

86
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,000
when we got back into that room. We

87
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,920
said, "What if we had come here 30 or 40

88
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,080
years

89
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:23,679
ago and in the 1940s or 50s and asked

90
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,360
for the movie Hemp for Victory?" You

91
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:29,360
would have gone to the electronic

92
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,560
searches or the current cataloges or any

93
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,480
of the other things that you've used

94
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,080
today, the card cataloges to file. Where

95
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:35,679
where would those cataloges be? Do you

96
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,200
throw them away? And she said, "No,

97
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,719
they're over by the copier. you keep all

98
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:40,958
the old cataloges and you can go over

99
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:41,840
there and look. But um if they would

100
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,920
have been here, they would have showed

101
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,519
up on the if it would have been in any

102
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:48,639
of those books, it would have shown up

103
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:50,799
already today in our searches. Now, I'd

104
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:53,039
like to show you a typical letter that

105
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,840
was sent out denying that this movie was

106
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:57,840
made by the United States Department of

107
00:03:54,840 --> 00:04:00,400
Agriculture or any other division of the

108
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:03,039
United States government. Listen to it.

109
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,640

118
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:26,478

Hemp for Victory that was produced by

120

need for American grown hemp for

149

foreign practices of hemp growers in

00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:50,639
Kentucky and Wisconsin. And this went

152
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:53,918
out to um in supposedly into the

153
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:55,360

177
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,079
shows how the war cut off our supply of

178
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,520
East Indian coarse fibers and the urgent

179
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:03,839
need for American grown hemp for our

180
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:06,000
army and navy as well as civilian use.

181
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:08,198
portrays farm practices of hemp growers

182
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,199
in Kentucky and

183
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:13,478
Wisconsin. The proof now is that this

184
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:15,759
movie does really

185
00:07:13,478 --> 00:07:17,839
exist. Now, the government for years

186
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:20,280
have been telling all of our media that

187
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:22,519
this movie didn't exist and all of our

188
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:25,679
activists were

189
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:27,918
being impuged on their integrity. We

190
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,478
think uh let the movie speak for itself.

191
00:07:27,918 --> 00:07:32,639
You'll please watch all 14 minutes of

192
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:35,120
this film because it every bit of it is

193
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,879
memorable. Right up to when you see the

194
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,879
parachute webbing that George Bush

195

199
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:16,319
Long ago, when these ancient Grecian

200
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:19,360
temples were new, hemp was already old

201
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:22,080
in the service of mankind.

202
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:24,240
For thousands of years, even then, this

203
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:26,560
plant had been grown for cordage and

204
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,280
coarse cloth in China and elsewhere in

205
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:32,240
the

206
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:33,838
east. For centuries prior to about 1850,

207
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,278
all the ships that sailed the western

208
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,800
seas were rigged with hemp and rope and

209
00:08:36,278 --> 00:08:43,320
sails. For the sailor, no less than the

210
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:43,319
hangman, hemp was indispensable.

211
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:51,919
A 44 gun frigot, like our cherished old

212
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:54,080
iron sides, took over 60 tons of hemp

213
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:54,079
for

214
00:08:56,278 --> 00:09:01,000
rigging, including an anchor cable 25 in

215
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:07,159

[Music]

217
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:12,079
circumference. The Konos Stoga wagons

218
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:14,239
and prayer schooners of pioneer days

219
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,160
were covered with hemp and canvas.

220
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:19,200
Indeed, the very word canvas comes from

221
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:19,199
the Arabic word for

222
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:26,800
hemp. In those days, hemp was an

223
00:09:23,278 --> 00:09:26,799
important crop in Kentucky and

224
00:09:27,559 --> 00:09:33,359
Missouri. Then came cheaper imported

225
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,679
fibers for cottage like jute, cy, and

226
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:38,399
manila hemp, and the culture of hemp in

227
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:40,479
America declined.

228
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,919
But now with Philippine and East Indian

229
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,600
sources of hemp in the hands of the

230
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:46,958
Japanese and shipment of juke from India

231
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:49,360
curtailed, American hemp must meet the

232
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:52,479
needs of our army and navy as well as of

233
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:54,399
our industries. In 1942, patriotic

234
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:57,200
farmers at the government's request

235
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:59,679
planted 36,000 acres of seed hemp, an

236
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:04,040
increase of several thousand%. The goal

237
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:06,879
for 1943 is 50,000 acres of seed

238
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:08,958
hemp. In Kentucky, much of the seed hemp

239
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:11,600
acorage is on river bottom land such as

240
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:13,439
this along the Kentucky River Gorge.

241
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,759
Some of these fields are inaccessible

242
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,600
except by

243
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:19,838
boat. Thus, plans are a foot for a great

244
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,240
expansion of the hemp industry as a part

245
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:23,920
of the war program. This film is

246
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,839
designed to tell farmers how to handle

247
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:28,799
this ancient crop now little known

248
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:32,399
outside Kentucky and Wisconsin. This is

249
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:34,559
hemp seed. Be careful how you use it.

250
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:37,440
For to grow hemp legally, you must have

251
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:40,319
a federal registration and tax stamp.

252
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,959
This is provided for in your contract.

253
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:45,800
Ask your AAA committeeman or your county

254
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:48,239
agent about it. Don't

255
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:50,240
forget, hemp demands a rich, well-

256
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,480
drained soil such as is found here in

257
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:55,070
the bluegrass region of Kentucky or in

258
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:59,200
central Wisconsin.

00:10:55,070 --> 00:11:01,200
[Music]

260
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:04,959
It must be loose and rich in organic

261
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,959
matter. Poor soils won't

262
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:11,320
do. Soil that will grow good corn will

263
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:14,320
usually grow

264
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:15,920
hemp. Hemp is not hard on the soil. In

265
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,760
Kentucky, it has been grown for several

266
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:19,240
years on the same ground, though this

267
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:22,000
practice is not

268
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:23,720
recommended. A dense and shady crop,

269
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,159
hemp tends to choke out

270
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:27,399
weeds. Here's a Canada thistle that

271
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:30,559
couldn't stand the

272
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:32,078
competition. Dead as a dodo. Thus, hemp

273
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:33,639
leaves the ground in good condition for

274
00:11:32,078 --> 00:11:36,159
the following

275
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:38,399
crop. For fiber, hemp should be sewn

276
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:40,559
five pecks to the acre. With drill, the

277
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:43,519
closer the rows, the better. These rows

278
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:43,518
are spaced about 4

279
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:48,399
in. This hemp has been broadcast. Either

280
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:50,838
way, it should be sewn thick enough to

281
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:53,559
grow a slender

282
00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:56,560
stalk.

283
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:58,559
Here's an ideal stand. The right height

284
00:11:56,559 --> 00:12:00,239
to be harvested easily, thick enough to

285
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:02,719
grow slender stalks that are easier to

286
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,720
cut and

287
00:12:06,278 --> 00:12:11,120
process. Stalks like these here on the

288
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:13,359
left, they yield the most fiber and the

289
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,600
best. Those on the right are too coarse

290
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,600
and

291
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:22,480
woody. For seed, hemp is planted in

292
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:24,800
hills like corn, sometimes by hand.

293
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:27,200
Hemp is a dishious plant. The female

294
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:29,679
flower is inconspicuous, but the male

295
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,360
flower is easily spotted. In seed

296
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:34,838
production, after the pollen has been

297
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:39,440
shed, these male plants are cut

298
00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:39,440
out. These are the seeds on a female

299
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:45,440
plant. Hemp for fiber is ready to

300
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:48,000
harvest when the pollen is shedding and

301
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:50,240
the leaves are falling. In Kentucky,

302
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,078
hemp harvest comes in August. Here the

303
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,839
old standby has been the self-rake

304
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:56,399
reaper which has been used for a

305
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,399
generation or

306
00:12:57,958 --> 00:13:02,559
more. Hemp grows so luxurantly in

307
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,399
Kentucky that harvesting is sometimes

308
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:06,399
difficult which may account for the

309
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:08,799
popularity of the self rake with its

310
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,799
lateral

311
00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:17,759
stroke. A modified rice binder has been

312
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,690
used to some extent. This machine works

313
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:22,939
well in average

harvester used for many years in

317
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,800
Wisconsin has been introduced in

318
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:38,000
Kentucky. This machine spreads the hemp

319
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:39,679
in a continuous swave. It is a far cry

320
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,519
from this fast and efficient modern

321
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:43,679
harvester to the Armstrong model of

322
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,360
Yore. But here's one kind of harvester,

323
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:47,278
at least that doesn't stall in the

324
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,278
heaviest hemp.

325
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:53,559
In Kentucky, hand cutting is practiced

326
00:13:49,278 --> 00:13:53,559
in opening fields for the machines.

327
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:02,078
In Kentucky, hemp is shocked as soon as

328
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:04,319
safe after cutting to be spread out for

329

[Music]

331

332
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,720
September. Here the hemp harvester with

333

335
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:33,120
rotating apron lays the swave

336
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,639
preparatory to wetting. Here it is a

337
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,879
common and essential practice to leave

338
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:38,639
headlands around hemp fields. These

339
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:41,519
strips may be planted to other crops,

340
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:43,120
preferably small grain. Thus the

341
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:45,440
harvester has room to make its first

342
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,120
round without preparatory hand cutting.

343
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:50,120
Here the machine is running over corn

344
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,120
stubble.

345
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:56,079
When the cutter bar is much shorter than

346
00:14:53,198 --> 00:14:58,159
the hemp is tall, overlapping occurs.

347
00:14:56,078 --> 00:15:00,759
Not so good for reading. The standard

348
00:14:58,159 --> 00:15:03,360
cut is 8 to 9

349
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:07,039
ft. The length of time hemp is left on

350
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,039
the ground to rest depends on the

351
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:14,639
weather. The swave must be turned to get

352
00:15:11,198 --> 00:15:18,839
a uniform rest.

When the woody core breaks away readily

355
00:15:23,278 --> 00:15:28,799
like this, the hemp is about ready to

356
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:28,799
take up and bind into

357
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:38,399
bundles. Well-rtted hemp is light to

358
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:40,799
dark gray. The fiber tends to pull away

359
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:43,120
from the stalk. The presence of stalks

360
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:45,159
in the bow string stage indicates that

361
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:53,278

the ground is too wet for machine, it is

swath should last smooth and even with

372
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:24,720

hemp were harvested in the United

I'm going to read this letter to

of the use of marijuana and of the

448
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:04,320
forces lurking behind it are the most

449

important jobs this department is now

450
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:08,798
engaged in. At the outset of this

451
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:11,120
letter, there is one vital fact I would

452
00:22:08,798 --> 00:22:13,440
like to submit. There is a powerful

453
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:15,678
agency. I speak of the school parent

454
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:18,279
associations of this country which can

455
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:20,880
be invaluable in stamping up this

456
00:22:18,279 --> 00:22:23,038
scourge. Their help, their eternal

457
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:25,360
vigilance could be the deciding factor

458
00:22:23,038 --> 00:22:27,759
in our fight against it. The weed

459
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:30,798
marijuana is grown in every state in the

460
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:31,640
union. Recently in the city of Brooklyn,

461
00:22:30,798 --> 00:22:34,798

462
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:37,520

463
00:22:34,798 --> 00:22:40,319
behind a tenement court. The weed was

464
00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:43,359
here being cultivated, regularly

465
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:46,399
stripped and dried and sold in schools

466
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:47,798
and at government army posts in and

467
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,960
around New

468
00:22:47,798 --> 00:22:53,839
York. The dried leaves and berries are

469
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:57,759
ground up and made into cigarettes by a

470
00:22:53,839 --> 00:23:00,558
simple hand machine. The deadly narcotic

471
00:22:57,759 --> 00:23:01,640
is thus quickly and easily prepared for

472
00:23:00,558 --> 00:23:04,879
its

473
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:07,200
market. The sale of marijuana is even

474
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:09,840
more difficult to detect and halt than

475
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:12,279
the traffic in drugs such as opium,

476
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:15,879
morphine, and

477
00:23:12,279 --> 00:23:19,519
heroin. They are hidden in fake jewelry

478

cases, in the heels of shoes, women's

479
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:25,279
shoes especially, because the drugs can

480
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:28,240
be secreted in false heels.

481

Hollow shavenishes are another medium.

Watch cases are convenient hiding

484
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:39,279
places. The value of drugs thus seized

485
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:42,159
is enormous. Recently, a huge supply of

486
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:45,200
heroin was taken. It was concealed in an

487
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:48,080
apparently harmless shipment of 35

488
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:50,480
barrels of olive oil. The deadly drug

489
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:53,038
was burned in the incinerator of the

490

491

of

494

movies or has recommended acceptance as

503
00:24:22,798 --> 00:24:27,639
you can see in the

504
00:24:24,119 --> 00:24:30,479
letter from the assistant chief of the

505
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:35,200
MBRS division gift to video cassettes.

506
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:37,440
His name is Paul C. Spear S PR.

507
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:40,240
And uh he says two half-inch video

508
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:43,840
cassettes were brought to the MBE RS

509
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:46,480
division. On Friday, May 19th, 1989,

510
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:48,079
their bearer Jack Herror Hemp Pack,

511
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,759
California Marijuana Initiative, Van

512
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:51,359

513
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:53,599
Marijuana Prohibition Hemp Pack

514
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:55,639
Political Action Committee wishes to

515
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:57,839
donate the tapes to the libraries

516
00:24:55,640 --> 00:25:01,120
collections. He spoke with Mrs.

517
00:24:57,839 --> 00:25:03,119
Katherine Long. The tapes are duplicate.

518
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:05,678
Each contains the following hemp. Hemp

519
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:07,439
for victory produced in 1942 by the

520
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:10,240
United States Department of Agriculture

521
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:13,759
14 minutes and reefer madness excerpts

522
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:17,599
produced in 1936 originally 167 minutes

523
00:25:13,759 --> 00:25:20,240
but this material is excerpts only. I

524
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:22,639
recommend that we accept them and that's

525
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:25,519
from Paul C. Spears assistant chief of

526
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:28,080
that gift division of the motion

527
00:25:25,519 --> 00:25:29,879
pictures and film strips.

528
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:34,000
Now, I'd like to ask you to

529
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:37,919
send $20 to the Help Eliminate Marijuana

530
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:41,880
Prohibition Hemp Pack, 5632 Vanise

531
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:47,120
Boulevard, Vanise, California, sweet

532
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:49,679
210, zip 91401, Van Eis, California. Our

533
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:49,678
phone number is

534
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:57,360
8183775886. And we'd like you to know

535
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:59,200
that we'll send you a copy of Hemp for

536
00:25:57,359 --> 00:26:02,319
Victory with all the documentation you

537
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:06,400
just saw, as well as a copy of the book,

538
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:09,200
The Emperor Wears No Clothes. And please

539
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:10,960
use this information. Send away for more

540
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,159
of this information. If you'd like one

541
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:15,720
of our t-shirts, they're

542
00:26:13,159 --> 00:26:19,520
$12. They're the Hemp for Victory

543
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:22,079
T-shirt. And um we have new t-shirts

544
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:25,119
coming out all the time. What we want

545
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:28,558
you to do is support normal, support

546
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:31,239
hemp, and get this information around.

547
00:26:28,558 --> 00:26:33,200
Uh we're really a grassroots

548
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:34,640
organization. But we have one big

549
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,240
message, and that is that your

550
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:39,038
government, for whatever its reasons,

551
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:41,359
lied about the number one product

552
00:26:39,038 --> 00:26:44,720
probably on earth for paper, fiber,

553
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:48,000
fuel, and food. Whether it did it at a

554
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:49,839
conscious level or unconscious level,

555
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,599
they've been sending people hundreds and

556
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:54,038
hundreds of thousands to prison and

557
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:57,839
taking away their their

558
00:26:54,038 --> 00:26:58,839
properties, their children, their cars

559
00:26:57,839 --> 00:27:02,000
for

560
00:26:58,839 --> 00:27:04,000
marijuana. that in any sane society they

561
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:08,200
would reward people for using in

562
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,200
comparison to alcohol and tobacco.

563
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:39,200
The national drug control strategy

564
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:41,000
proposed by President Bush and Drugs R.

565
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:44,558
Bennett isn't worth the environmentally

566
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:47,640
disastrous and unnecessary sulfuric acid

567
00:27:44,558 --> 00:27:50,798
and dioxin laced wood pulp processed

568
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:52,640
paper which it is printed on.

569
00:27:50,798 --> 00:27:55,200
Specifically, the continued prohibition

570
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:57,278
of hemp marijuana cultivation prevents

571
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:00,159
our society from utilizing nature's

572
00:27:57,278 --> 00:28:02,960
premier renewable resource for the

573
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:05,919
majority of Earth's paper, fiber, fuel,

574
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:07,759
food, paint, and medicine. Ironically,

575
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:10,399
at the time of George Washington, he and

576
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:12,558
all American farmers were required to

577
00:28:10,398 --> 00:28:16,239
grow and could even pay their taxes with

578
00:28:12,558 --> 00:28:18,240
hemp. Why? Because hemp was the used for

579
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:20,960
the majority of colonial Americas in the

580
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:24,480
world's paper, clothing, towels,

581
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:26,720
diapers, lace, sales, canvas, Dutch

582
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:29,278
pronunciation of cannabis, rope, paint,

583
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:31,120
varnish, lighting oil, and more. In

584
00:28:29,278 --> 00:28:32,960
fact, as recently as World War II, with

585
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:34,879
Philippine and Asian hemp cut off by the

586
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:37,519
Japanese, the US Department of

587
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:40,000
Agriculture in 1942 produced a 14minute

588
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:41,918
black and white film, Hemp for Victory,

589
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,960
encouraging and instructing patriotic

590
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:48,480
American farmers to grow 350,000 acres

591
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:50,480
of hemp per year by 1943 to be used for

592
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,720
civilian and military shoes, rope, fire

593
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:54,399
hoses. Even the parachute webbing that

594
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:56,319
George Bush held on to when he bailed

595
00:28:54,398 --> 00:28:59,278
out over the Pacific was made from

596
00:28:56,319 --> 00:29:01,359
cannabis hemp. Hemp uses the sun more

597
00:28:59,278 --> 00:29:04,278
efficiently than virtually any other

598
00:29:01,359 --> 00:29:06,918
plant on our planet. In fact, on a

599
00:29:04,278 --> 00:29:11,159
planetwide, climatewide, and soilwide

600
00:29:06,919 --> 00:29:14,159
basis, hemp grown annually would produce

601
00:29:11,159 --> 00:29:16,799
approximately 40 times the biomass that

602
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:19,760
is living organic matter of the next

603
00:29:16,798 --> 00:29:23,519
best annual rival biomass crops that be

604
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:26,839
can grown on Earth, such as corn, kunaf,

605
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:26,839
and sugarcane.

606
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,960
Today, we have the ability and the

607
00:29:29,038 --> 00:29:33,599
mechanized technology to use hemp

608
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:36,360
biomass and other biomasses for energy

609
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:38,879
farming and produce all of the

610
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:39,959
clean renewable fuel we would need for

611
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,960
all of our

612
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:45,399
cars, homes, and industry with a net

613
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:47,840
reduction of carbon

614
00:29:45,398 --> 00:29:49,759
dioxide. Theoretical computer models

615
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:52,720
have shown that reversing the greenhouse

616
00:29:49,759 --> 00:29:56,158
effect will only be possible, if

617
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:59,038
possible at all. If hemp and other

618
00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:01,919
biomass waste are used again as they

619
00:29:59,038 --> 00:30:03,519
were until 130 years ago for making the

620
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:05,440
overall majority of Earth's paper,

621
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:08,639
fiber, fuels, paints, varnish, and now

622
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:10,679
everything from plastics to dynamite. As

623
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,799
for

624
00:30:10,679 --> 00:30:14,798
marijuana, the blossom of the hemp

625
00:30:12,798 --> 00:30:16,398
plant, US government clinical studies,

626
00:30:14,798 --> 00:30:18,519
as well as studies of the Jamaican,

627
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:21,519
Costa Rican, and Greek marijuana using

628
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:23,278
populations, indicate statistically that

629
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:24,960
you will live more than a year longer if

630
00:30:23,278 --> 00:30:28,960
you smoke marijuana every day than if

631
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:31,360
you use no drugs at all and 8 to 24

632
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:35,038
years longer than regular tobacco and

633
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:37,839
alcohol users. In 1987, US government

634
00:30:35,038 --> 00:30:41,038
statistics reported 395,000 Americans

635
00:30:37,839 --> 00:30:43,918
died from tobacco. 87% of all lung

636
00:30:41,038 --> 00:30:45,679
cancer cases were caused by tobacco use.

637
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:48,559
Also, the National Institute of Drug

638
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:52,640
Abuse, that's NIA, reports 125,000

639
00:30:48,558 --> 00:30:54,639
Americans died in 1987 from alcohol use.

640
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:56,960
That same agency and the Surgeon

641
00:30:54,640 --> 00:31:01,038
General's mortality statistics report

642
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:05,038
zero Zero deaths ever due to marijuana.

643
00:31:01,038 --> 00:31:07,519
And as of October 1988, no case of lung

644
00:31:05,038 --> 00:31:09,158
cancer has ever been attributed solely

645
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:12,639
to marijuana

646
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:15,440
use. Therefore, we at Hemp are seeking a

647
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:18,640
marijuana hemp armistice. That is an

648
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:20,159
immediate nationwide moratorum on the

649
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:22,080
personal medical and industrial

650
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:23,600
suppression of hemp. and for the

651
00:31:22,079 --> 00:31:26,158
president and congress to immediately

652
00:31:23,599 --> 00:31:28,558
appoint a hemp advisory commission to

653
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:31,520
oversee and expedite reintroduction of

654
00:31:28,558 --> 00:31:33,359
hemp to American agriculture, business

655
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:35,759
and medicine.

656
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:38,000
Our justifications for this moratorium

657
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:40,398
commission are that with few exceptions,

658
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,480
none of the American public, especially

659
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:44,558
our politicians who should have known

660
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:46,079
when they made these laws, the judges

661
00:31:44,558 --> 00:31:48,480
who should have known when they enforced

662
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:50,000
them, and the police and even the

663
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,319
teachers who should have taught them and

664
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,720
all the rest of us in the first place,

665
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:58,879
knew virtually any of the preceding

666
00:31:55,720 --> 00:32:01,679
history, facts, information, or the vast

667
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:05,679
potential of hemp as Earth's premier

668
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:07,000
natural renewal. able resource biomass

669
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:09,759
and life

670
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:12,880
extender. If I have to go to jail for

671
00:32:09,759 --> 00:32:14,919
fighting for that or give of any other

672
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:17,840
part or you should, you should be proud

673
00:32:14,919 --> 00:32:20,399
to. I mean, such a sweet thing as

674
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:22,000
marijuana to go to jail for put there by

675
00:32:20,398 --> 00:32:24,479
people that don't even know this

676
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,759
information. Haven't the foggiest idea.

677
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:29,200
And yet chemicals,

678
00:32:26,759 --> 00:32:30,720
petrochemicals, fossil fuels are totally

679
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,159
legal. and hemp. One of the greatest

680
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,120
things that we, if not the greatest

681
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:36,960
natural growing thing on earth, is

682
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:38,398
illegal. Every damn politician out there

683
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:40,319
be should be ashamed of themselves

684
00:32:38,398 --> 00:32:42,000
forever if they continue this now that

685
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:43,599
they know this or they and don't check

686
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,679
it out if they've heard it and they

687
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:47,359
don't believe it. Check it out. But if

688
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:49,840
it's true, you better change your ways

689
00:32:47,359 --> 00:32:51,678
because if a world would accept you, I

690
00:32:49,839 --> 00:32:53,278
wouldn't want to live in that world. And

691
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:55,038
if the world doesn't accept you, you

692
00:32:53,278 --> 00:32:57,200
should you should be proud of a world

693
00:32:55,038 --> 00:32:59,278
that would teach you how to behave like

694
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:01,759
adults. Like you want kids to behave

695
00:32:59,278 --> 00:33:03,759
like to be responsible to control their

696
00:33:01,759 --> 00:33:05,679
uses. We expect you to control the

697
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:08,640
abuses of the power of legislating

698
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:13,320
stupidity, ignorance, and the end of my

699
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:13,320
planet. That's all.
