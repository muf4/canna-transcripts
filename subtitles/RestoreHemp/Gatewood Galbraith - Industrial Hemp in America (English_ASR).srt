1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:06,479
and the question of himp the question of

2
00:00:03,399 --> 00:00:08,480
cannabis is the most Vivid illustration

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,400
of how this government has overstepped

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:13,280
its bounds in policing the private

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,320
behavior of citizens when they told us

6
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:18,000
we couldn't plant a hip seed in the

7
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:21,480
ground they severed us from the natural

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,839
cycle that is what they seek to do I

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,960
call it the synthetic subversion where

10
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:28,079
they want to replace all the natural

11
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:30,679
products on Earth that used to be grown

12
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:33,878
out of God's Earth and God's seed and

13
00:00:30,678 --> 00:00:35,519
replaced them with synthetic products

14
00:00:33,878 --> 00:00:38,640
and knocked our farmer out of the

15
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:41,440
agrarian society and The Agrarian market

16
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:44,239
and made the ghost towns of our small

17
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:47,359
cities and Villages across this country

18
00:00:44,238 --> 00:00:49,000
we need to ReDiscover a cast crop one

19
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:51,320
that will allow our Farmers to go back

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
to the land one that will allow our

21
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:57,640
Farmers to compete with the

22
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:00,159
petrochemical pipelines you plant us 7%

23
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:02,960
agricultural land in him you would have

24
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:05,640
to import another drop of oil we can

25
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:08,840
replace the spills in the Gulf we can

26
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,920
replace the uh environmental catastrophe

27
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:13,079
that the petroleum pipelines have cast

28
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:17,840
upon Mother Earth and instead let our

29
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:19,879
Farmers grow hemp as a fuel crop in 1991

30
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,200
Willie Nelson and I poured Hall into my

31
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:24,719
Mercedes diesel and drove it across

32
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:27,640
Kentucky in my bid for governor that's

33
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:31,879
