00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,500
hi my name is Aaron purchase and I am

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,960
speaking on behalf of the girl mama

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:10,219
project and the pediatric patients of

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:13,830
Oregon they are the Forgotten ones as

5
00:00:10,218 --> 00:00:18,240
money starts rolling in and taxes start

6
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:20,820
coming in and what we voted for gets not

7
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:24,028
listened to and regulation hits Oregon

8
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:25,768
Medical Marijuana Program several

9
00:00:24,028 --> 00:00:29,250
children ended up without a grower

10
00:00:25,768 --> 00:00:31,169
without access to medications because of

11
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:35,070
the limitations they have imposed on our

12
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:37,530
program this is not right this is the

13
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:40,950
most vulnerable group of patients on our

14
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:44,280
program and a bunch of people have

15
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:46,109
forgotten them in 2012 my daughter was

16
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,420
diagnosed with cancer and I treated it

17
00:00:46,109 --> 00:00:49,979
with cannabis oil last week I was told

18
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,770
by the oncologist she has a better

19
00:00:49,979 --> 00:00:54,628
chance of not relapsing than every other

20
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:56,719
child on their program because I was

21
00:00:54,628 --> 00:01:01,140
able to use cannabis oil instead of

22
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:03,149
radiation instead of high-dose chemo my

23
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:05,460
daughter has survived a year past

24
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:08,640
treatments making her chance of relapse

25
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:10,829
go down even further this is amazing

26
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,450
this is progressive medicine there has

27
00:01:10,829 --> 00:01:15,840
not been medicine coming out for

28
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:18,750
childhood cancer in 50 years we need

29
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,640
research we did not legalize

30
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:23,989
recreational cannabis to forget about

31
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:29,159
the medical program we legalized it to

32
00:01:23,989 --> 00:01:31,289
make research happen to change the way

33
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:34,799
that the general public thinks about

34
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:36,420
cannabis we did not legalize to make it

35
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,640
so a bunch of people could go party with

36
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:41,579
pot I mean granted it's fun and I do it

37
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,409
too but when it comes down to it the

38
00:01:41,578 --> 00:01:46,258
patients on this program or what matter

39
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:47,939
and the regulations that they have

40
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:52,290
imposed or taking medicine out of the

41
00:01:47,938 --> 00:01:55,679
hands of patients to grow 12 plants in

42
00:01:52,290 --> 00:02:01,770
city limits makes hardly any cannabis

43
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:04,829
oil you cannot supply six patients on 12

44
00:02:01,769 --> 00:02:07,408
plants my daughter took 3 grams a day

45
00:02:04,828 --> 00:02:10,199
for two years through treatment that's

46
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:13,099
what it required I think it would take

47
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:15,169
to at least two maybe four cards too

48
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:17,180
her that on a monthly basis now I can

49
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:21,379
only grow for two patients me and her

50
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:22,939
which means I think six to eight of our

51
00:02:21,379 --> 00:02:25,219
patients I can't remember exactly how

52
00:02:22,939 --> 00:02:26,960
many we had have lost their grower they

53
00:02:25,219 --> 00:02:30,650
lost their medicine and most of those

54
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:35,180
were children they are now forced to go

55
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:37,250
elsewhere find other medicine another

56
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:38,900
thing that that's a big problem is we

57
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:41,479
have it easy here in Portland we have

58
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:42,890
hundreds of dispensaries we need to use

59
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:44,780
our voices for the people on the other

60
00:02:42,889 --> 00:02:47,439
side of the state I come from Eastern

61
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:49,759
Oregon I come from a place where

62
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:52,159
dispensaries are completely forbidden

63
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:54,079
this weekend I met a dying cancer

64
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:57,049
patient who was completely ripped off

65
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:59,180
she bought two hundred and fifty dollar

66
00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:01,400
jar of glycerin tincture with I don't

67
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:03,500
even think it had cannabis in it that is

68
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:06,349
ridiculous and that could be prevented

69
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:09,199
but these legislators are preventing

70
00:03:06,349 --> 00:03:12,259
that from happening we need to get to

71
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:14,359
this capital I know that you all don't

72
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:16,429
get paid to do it it's very hard to

73
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,110
drive all the way here but it's much

74
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:21,379
harder to drive from the eastern side of

75
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:23,930
the state let's get to these people talk

76
00:03:21,379 --> 00:03:26,120
to them don't just speak for yourself

77
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:27,500
please keep in mind the patient's clear

78
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:30,080
across Oregon the most vulnerable

79
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:32,419
patients that are too sick and dying to

80
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:35,120
be here we need to use our voice for

81
00:03:32,419 --> 00:03:37,219
them I'm a patient too I'm sick but I'm

82
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:40,250

00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:50,300

everyone you know about the medical

90
00:03:56,949 --> 00:04:01,909
benefits of this plant because that

91
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:03,980
cannot be forgotten as we go forth with

92
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:07,549
setting up our recreational market which

93
00:04:03,979 --> 00:04:09,739
I I am very happy that nobody you know

94
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:11,450
has to go to prison for just smoking a

95
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:13,040
joint anymore on the side of the street

96
00:04:11,449 --> 00:04:15,199
or something that's amazing but we also

97
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:17,089
need to make sure that our medical

98
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:18,889
patients retain the rights that they've

99
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:21,259
always had maybe even get more rights

100
00:04:18,889 --> 00:04:23,180
instead of taking away their medicine

101
00:04:21,259 --> 00:04:24,839
let's make it easier for them to get

102
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:26,370
more affordable medicine let's

103
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:29,429
make it covered on your insurance the

104
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:32,100
Oregon Health Plan I can't even get my

105
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:34,228
state I go to a state county or the

106
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:36,180
county Cal Health Department clinic for

107
00:04:34,228 --> 00:04:39,149
my regular doctor I get treated like

108
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:41,519
crap for being a medical patient I can't

109
00:04:39,149 --> 00:04:42,989
even get anything treated because i use

110
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:44,339
candidates nothing they won't even

111
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:46,530
prescribe you medicine not only that I

112
00:04:44,339 --> 00:04:48,119
have to sign a contract for them that

113
00:04:46,529 --> 00:04:49,888
they won't give me anything but do you

114
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:54,629
think they'll sign my medical marijuana

115
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:56,370
card absolutely not and they will make

116
00:04:54,629 --> 00:04:58,560
it known that they don't support it that

117
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:59,728
they don't see any benefit and Oh matter

118
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,699
of fact all your health problems are

119
00:04:59,728 --> 00:05:06,120
probably cuz you use it that's not right

120
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:08,219
this cannabis has taken me off of a lot

121
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,660
of pharmaceuticals it replaced a lot of

122
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:12,930
pharmaceuticals that my daughter did not

123
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:15,720
have to have they are lying to us and we

124
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:18,389
need to gain the support of everybody so

125
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:20,250
that we can take control of our program

126
00:05:18,389 --> 00:05:24,500
take control of our market and make it

127
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:24,500
what we want it to be thank you
