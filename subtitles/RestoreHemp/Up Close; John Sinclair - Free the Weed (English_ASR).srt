station radi free amsterdam.com

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,440
that's what I do now that's my passion

4
00:00:10,199 --> 00:00:13,718
how much time you spend over there in

5
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:18,039
the Netherlands much as I can get away

6
00:00:13,718 --> 00:00:21,879
with uhhuh I don't know it

7
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:25,279
varies I don't have any work there so I

8
00:00:21,879 --> 00:00:27,799
have to go other places to

9
00:00:25,278 --> 00:00:32,159
work but then I go back there to spend

10
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:34,679
the money so I see yeah so in

11
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:37,359
Michigan what's the scene like there now

12
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:41,679
these days there's the dispensaries

13
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:43,359
opening up no they sh down UT down the

14
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:48,280
Attorney General of the state of

15
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:51,640
Michigan Shu William Shu General

16
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:54,239
Shu was also the guy who before he was

17
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:57,320
elected attorney general as a

18
00:00:54,238 --> 00:01:00,558
republican under the governor we have

19
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:03,280
was elected on the tough nerd ticket

20
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:05,438
mhm well you can pretty much imagine

21
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,920
what a state governed by a tough nerd is

22
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:08,199
going to be like it's not going to be

23
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:11,118
nothing

24
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:13,359
nice and this guy taking over the local

25
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:14,959
city governments well that's part of

26
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:16,799
their plan yeah especially those

27
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:19,118
operated by

28
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,520
Negros they think the white people know

29
00:01:19,118 --> 00:01:23,400
how to do this better because they did

30
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:23,399
so well with our

31
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:31,280
economy so they like to go in and take

32
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,680
over the city under this thing called

33
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:37,000
emergency

34
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:39,360
manager system and it allows them to

35
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,920
Blade all their Union

36
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:45,159
contracts declare bankruptcy get rid of

37
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:47,879
the pensions of people who hadn't spent

38
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:50,118
all their lives working for these cities

39
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:51,118
and tell them what to do for the future

40
00:01:50,118 --> 00:01:54,040
you

41
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:57,399
know so they just diverted this in

42
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:58,840
Detroit but they have a emergency

43
00:01:57,399 --> 00:02:02,640
Financial

44
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:05,920
board it's going to run the city which

45
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:08,840
the city had to agree to

46
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:12,239
except the only alternative us who

47
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:14,159
accepted an emergency manager system so

48
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:18,480
it's very gruesome you know and cities

49
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:21,239
like Detroit and Flint my hometown are

50
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:24,280
ruined Beyond repair economically

51
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:26,120
they've been disinvesting in them for

52
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:28,080
about 40

53
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:31,159
years

54
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:35,319
um finally reach

55
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:37,598
the fairly well off Suburban ring of

56
00:02:35,318 --> 00:02:38,839
white people that surrounds Detroit a

57
00:02:37,598 --> 00:02:41,280
couple years ago and that's when you

58
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:44,000
started hearing about Detroit but in the

59
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,120
city of Detroit the real city of Detroit

60
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,919
they did away with the jobs about 40

61
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:50,879
years ago MH so you got at least two

62
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:52,598
generations maybe you could call three

63
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:55,158
generations of people who have never had

64
00:02:52,598 --> 00:02:57,560
a job they don't know what a job is they

65
00:02:55,158 --> 00:03:00,519
don't know anyone who's had a job no one

66
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:03,400
in their family has had a job so it's

67
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:06,158
pretty they're desperate you know so

68
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:10,319
it's the worst

69
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:12,719
possible sort of situation as far as I'm

70
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:14,878
concerned and the sick part of it is

71
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:18,400
this is the Vanguard of what

72
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:20,239
they're holding up as model for the rest

73
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,280
not only America supposed to be the

74
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:26,719
Republican Guru so to speak well yeah

75
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:30,000
well he I started out to say that

76
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:34,000
Shu led the opposition to the medical

77
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,280
marijuana initiative of 2008 and he lost

78
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,120
on about a 2 to1

79
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:43,239
basis but then he was elected in 2010 as

80
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:44,239
part of the Republican backlash to the

81
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:47,239
to the

82
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,239
president

83
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:53,319
Administration so now he uses the

84
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:56,759
Attorney General's office as his focal

85
00:03:53,318 --> 00:04:01,158
point for trying to oppose the medical

86
00:03:56,759 --> 00:04:05,078
marijuana initiative that was passed

87
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:08,359
he does things like hold seminars for

88
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:11,719
local law enforcement and prosecutors

89
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:15,720
offices around the state of Michigan

90
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:18,399
which then is followed by bust of the

91
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:20,040
dispensaries like in Traver City they

92
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:22,478
had one of his

93
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:24,879
little you know

94
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:28,199
uh he tries to

95
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:31,680
explain to the local and Regional law

96
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:35,000
enforcement people how how they can

97
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:37,720
circumvent the medical marijuana act and

98
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,759
still bust people and prevent them from

99
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:42,360
having uh places where people can get

100
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:44,439
their medicine and what have you see in

101
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:46,960
Michigan the marijuana

102
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:51,038
La medical

103
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:53,359
marijuana recognizes only one sort of

104
00:04:51,038 --> 00:04:56,199
relationship and that is between a

105
00:04:53,360 --> 00:05:01,560
patient a registered patient and a

106
00:04:56,199 --> 00:05:01,560
registered caregiver who can grow for

107
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:08,120
patients there's no provision and the

108
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:11,079
initiative law that was passed for

109
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:15,079
dispensaries for dispensaries or any

110
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:18,758
sort of transfer outside of this model

111
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:21,839
mhmh everything is not caretaker to

112
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:25,080
Patient relation is regarded as not

113
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:27,959
acceptable by the state

114
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:30,879
authorities so it's not it's kind of

115
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:33,799
gruesome you know they were're building

116
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:35,839
great industry throughout the state with

117
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:37,800
dispensaries and then as you know they

118
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:40,879
just started raing them and shutting

119
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:42,879
them down and persecuting people like my

120
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:46,600
friend Adam Brooke who organized the

121
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:48,399
hash bash for about 20 years they raided

122
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,960
him from marijuana and then he had some

123
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:52,839
illegal guns in his house and now he's

124
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:56,079
in prison for two years in Michigan

125
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:58,079
State Prison in Michigan yeah so that's

126
00:05:56,079 --> 00:06:00,478
one of the side effects of this kind of

127
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:04,038
stuff either they shut up him down or

128
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:06,399
the you know he was a patient and he was

129
00:06:04,038 --> 00:06:10,000
registered and all his marijuana issues

130
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:14,279
were in order but for some reason he was

131
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:17,720
a gut you know so mhm I feel terrible

132
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:19,119
for him yeah but on the other hand I

133
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:22,319
have no

134
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:25,120
guns yeah I don't even like

135
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:27,840
guns I don't believe it in

136
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,598
myself so I know there's an initiative

137
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:31,478
out there right now it doesn't look like

138
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:33,959
going to make the ballot but Matt AEL

139
00:06:31,478 --> 00:06:36,199
was pushing it Matt's doing a good job

140
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:38,359
but yeah it's just him and his the

141
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:41,160
people they've had a group that's met

142
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:43,639
every Monday I met over at their office

143
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:44,960
once about I don't know four months ago

144
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:47,879
well they've been doing that every week

145
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:49,560
for months yeah and the initiative came

146
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:52,319
out of that but they don't have the

147
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:54,720
support of the the money people people

148
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:57,080
with the big money who have who help

149
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:00,479
support the M marijuana Initiative for

150
00:06:57,079 --> 00:07:04,279
example right and then there's some sort

151
00:07:00,478 --> 00:07:06,279
of I don't know the dispensary people

152
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:08,119
have their own organization and they're

153
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:11,399
kind of trying to make a deal with the

154
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:14,199
state legislature on the side and they

155
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:17,000
aren't really supporting the initiative

156
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:19,199
so I don't know I pray for the best I've

157
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:24,120
been waiting for this for a long

158
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:26,199
time I started my crusade as they might

159
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,519
say against the marijuana wasw in

160
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:30,319
January of

161
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:32,878
1965 mhm how'd you start

162
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:36,400
I put out a flyer and that was in

163
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:39,400
Michigan yes sir I received in the mail

164
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:42,598

00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,440
I said well that's a great idea we

169
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:56,000
should one of these in Detroit so I went

170
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:58,120
to arm and grab machine and tied up a

171
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,839
stencil and ran off a thing and sent it

172
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:02,478
out and said the first meting meeting is

173
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:05,799
such and such we're going to legalize

174
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:09,758
marijuana in Michigan lar was a long

175
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:11,199
time ago yeah still all legal I know

176
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:14,080
well we're trying to legalize I know I

177
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:16,639
thought everything would be done with by

178
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:17,918
1977 sure that was my initial outl

179
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,759
that's what I thought too back in the

180
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:22,719
late 7s Jesus Christ what's wrong with

181
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:25,759
these people it's all about money power

182
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,319
and economic and political control and

183
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:30,759
yeah they got this police state they

184
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:33,200
build up on our backs this vast

185
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:34,839
huge almost

186
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:39,599
indescribably

187
00:08:34,839 --> 00:08:41,279
large police state apparatus yeah when

188
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,839
you count well what's the federal

189
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:46,399
government spend in a year now 18

190
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,839
billion on the War on Drugs yeah I think

191
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,720
at

192
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:54,440
least and growing and that doesn't count

193
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:57,839
to States you see and which Finance

194
00:08:54,440 --> 00:09:00,240
their Stormtrooper activities by seizing

195
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:04,120
the assets and the

196
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:06,440
and the products of the marijuana

197
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:09,759
community and then they buy a battering

198
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:11,800
R out electronic battery Rams and tanks

199
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:15,120
and

200
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:17,639
helicopters oh man it's hard to believe

201
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,600
they got it all yeah and then you go

202
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:22,838
beyond the police and there's the courts

203
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:26,079
and the drug courts and the pro extra

204
00:09:22,839 --> 00:09:29,600
prosecutors and all the extra coppers

205
00:09:26,078 --> 00:09:32,759
and all the narcotics bureaus and then

206
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:36,959
you got the you know the probation

207
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:39,480
officers the prison industry the parole

208
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:40,639
industry and my favorite the drug

209
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:43,480
treatment

210
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:45,559
industry which is the most asinine and

211
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:49,480
vicious of the whole

212
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:51,958
thing my daughter was had this pull over

213
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:53,200
by the side of the road and have a joint

214
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:55,439
she got

215
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:58,120
busted so she had to go to

216
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,680
Rehabilitation for being a marijuana

217
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,399
smoker

218
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:05,479
yeah yeah like she was what could you

219
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:07,159
possibly do to combat you know what's

220
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:09,720
wrong with that and the whole thing is

221
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:12,399
it's all based on nothing it's all like

222
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:15,959
Jak Harris said they don't have no

223
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:17,600
clothes on you know there's no uh

224
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:19,078
there's nothing wrong with why am I

225
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,720
talking to you I mean there's nothing

226
00:10:19,078 --> 00:10:25,199
wrong with marijuana I think the whole

227
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:27,399
thing is just a ridiculous Mis def when

228
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,879
I started in Michigan it was a narcotic

229
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:32,639
by ter now you got that law overturn

230
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:34,720
though right your case ended up in in

231
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:36,838
having that declared unconstitutional I

232
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:39,079
had to spent 3 years in prison though to

233
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:42,360
do that without an without an appeal

234
00:10:39,078 --> 00:10:44,879
Bond right for only two joints

235
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:47,720
yeah but then what happened after they

236
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:50,919
declared the Michigan medical I mean the

237
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:53,160
Michigan marijuana law

238
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:56,599
unconstitutional do the legisl go right

239
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:59,919
in a session to to recreate the laws or

240
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:03,000
the legislature had already

241
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:06,519
dealt with this issue I see and they

242
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:09,720
passed a new law reclassifying marijuana

243
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:12,399
as a controlled substance whatever that

244
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:15,160
is yeah oh I said that was more like a

245
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:17,039
spitball That's What I Call controlled

246
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:20,399
substance you

247
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:23,360
know but they red defined and the

248
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:27,559
important part was they changed the

249
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:30,399
entire system of penalties M so instead

250
00:11:27,559 --> 00:11:34,799
of 20 to life giving a layer selling

251
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:34,799
marijuana you can only give four years

252
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:42,200
maximum so the legislature passed this

253
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:44,920
law on December 9th of

254
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:49,160
1971 but the stipulation was that it

255
00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:52,439
would go into effect on April 1st

256
00:11:49,159 --> 00:11:55,278
1972 well my case was decided by the

257
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:57,720
Michigan Supreme Court my case now is

258
00:11:55,278 --> 00:12:00,120
linked to another case of a guy who was

259
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:02,160
convicted of sale

260
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:05,720
I was only convicted of

261
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:08,278
possession so our attorneys linked these

262
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:11,440
two cases together we both won so they

263
00:12:08,278 --> 00:12:15,159
threw out the whole

264
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:17,600
marijuana the crime the penalties people

265
00:12:15,159 --> 00:12:20,039
released and everything we are working

266
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:23,680
on an initiative here in go ahead that

267
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:25,159
was on like March 9th or March 12th and

268
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:28,078
the new law is going into effect on

269
00:12:25,159 --> 00:12:30,000
April 1st yeah for so for 3 weeks we

270
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:33,039
have a situ ation in Michigan where

271
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,720
there were no marijuana uhhuh did you

272
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:38,078
have a little taste of Freedom yeah it

273
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:41,600
was great which is great and that was

274
00:12:38,078 --> 00:12:44,879
right when you got out too well yeah 3

275
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:47,399
months so we would have where smoke

276
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:50,360
joints on stage and stuff like that we

277
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:53,480
took full advantage of this small

278
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:55,879
window and then when uh April first came

279
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:57,680
in April Fool's Day that's when we had

280
00:12:55,879 --> 00:12:59,480
the first hash Bash that's where the

281
00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:02,078
first hash bash started and that's the

282
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:04,159
first to thumb our noses at these people

283
00:13:02,078 --> 00:13:05,679
and say you might put this law into

284
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:07,838
effect but we aren't going to pay any

285
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:10,919
more attention to this one then we did

286
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:14,880
to the much more severe

287
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:17,000
one if you pardon the

288
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:18,879
expression you know we are so that's why

289
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,240
I like about the hashbar CU they have it

290
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:24,679
every year they said the 42nd one I

291
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:27,600
think 41 42nd I don't count all that

292
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:31,120
good without a calculator but been a

293
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:33,320
long time a long time every year yeah

294
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,919
that's a good thing that started right

295
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:36,440
around your case you know we're working

296
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:38,159
on an initiative here in Oregon to

297
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:41,240
completely Legalize It much like Matt

298
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:43,958
Able's initiative and and uh we're at

299
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:46,480
about we only need 87,000 signatures to

300
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:49,559
qualify oh you're we just tossed

301
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:55,240
70,000 so we've got 70,000 we have till

302
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:55,239
July 6th now this is

303
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:59,600
a32 yeah well you've got 10 million

304
00:13:57,559 --> 00:14:03,359
people where Oregon only has 3 million

305
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:04,879
so but this is text from our initiative

306
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,320
and this is one of the lines this is the

307
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:08,278
whole thing it says where is the people

308
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,759
find that despite misinformation con

309
00:14:08,278 --> 00:14:13,799
coed justify C's prohibition the courts

310
00:14:10,759 --> 00:14:15,480
of Alaska Hawaii and guess who Michigan

311
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:17,359
have noted presidential commission

312
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:20,159
findings that characterize Cas that's

313
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:22,879
what I call a comparatively harmless

314
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:26,759
euphorian yeah exactly it's not even a

315
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:29,480
drug a weed it's a beneficial thing and

316
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:31,959
there's a medical part of that yeah and

317
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:33,440
the fiber part which I happen to agree

318
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:36,359
with Dennis

319
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:39,000
Peron all marijuana uses medicinal in

320
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:41,600
America for

321
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:45,399
sure because we're up against a very

322
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:48,000
sickening social system here and I know

323
00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:50,278
if I couldn't get high every day I would

324
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,600
just Dash my head against the wall cuz

325
00:14:50,278 --> 00:14:56,320
I'm so ugly and frustrating you have to

326
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,839
find a way to elevate above

327
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,600
it TR to figure out the way to get

328
00:14:58,839 --> 00:15:02,920
through it you know that's what I look

329
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,920
at it

330
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:07,799
anyway so started that's why I started

331
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:10,639
you were an

332
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:13,319

Northwest Highway in 12 mile oh very

377
00:17:09,038 --> 00:17:14,679
good so is there anything you would want

378
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,400
to tell uh people today in terms of

379
00:17:14,679 --> 00:17:20,000
reforming marijuana laws what would you

380
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:25,439
tell activists today fre to

381
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:29,640
wait I like Matt uh Able's yeah language

382
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:33,360
the idea of ending marijuana Pro Bish I

383
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:35,440
think what they did with the with the

384
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:39,639
initiative was

385
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:42,240
to mandate the if pass the removal of

386
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:44,480
marijuana from any of the statutes of

387
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,359
the state of Michigan where it's

388
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:50,160
prescribing different things it would

389
00:17:46,359 --> 00:17:52,719
not be able to prescribe marijuana

390
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:55,720
use imagine if that would open the door

391
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,720
for the kind of I think culture I would

392
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:59,400
like to see that's what we're trying to

393
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:01,880
do here in Oregon we're putting it on

394
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:05,360
the ballot Oregon's been in the Vanguard

395
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:08,400
for a long time yeah I saw Alaska I

396
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:09,918
remember when Alaska was legal in Alaska

397
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,840
under the

398
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:17,240
Raven then under criminalized Ronnie

399
00:18:12,839 --> 00:18:19,158
Reagan they got the kind of dumb law the

400
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:21,720
teachers put out an initiative to rec

401
00:18:19,159 --> 00:18:24,360
criminalize it but then the courts threw

402
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:28,120
it out yeah well under Bill Bennett the

403
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:29,798
the first drugar they push that through

404
00:18:28,119 --> 00:18:32,839
yeah I didn't think we supposed to have

405
00:18:29,798 --> 00:18:36,279
Zars in this country Zars are like

406
00:18:32,839 --> 00:18:38,240
autocratic rulers sovet Russia either

407
00:18:36,279 --> 00:18:40,599
but it's like when they when they

408
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:43,599
collapsed America ate the heart of the

409
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:45,678
enemy and now they become just like it

410
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:47,599
replaced the American Heart they don't

411
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:50,600
have an American Heart anymore I don't

412
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:53,879
think I think this is just the coldest

413
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:56,439
ugliest most non caring Society Way

414
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:59,320
Beyond any of my wildest imaginings I'll

415
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:02,360
ever could be here I mean all my life

416
00:18:59,319 --> 00:19:05,119
I've never really been able to subscribe

417
00:19:02,359 --> 00:19:08,158
to the social system that dominates here

418
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:10,558
but man since Ronald re it's just like

419
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:12,280
watching yourself swirled on the toilet

420
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:15,639
like a piece of

421
00:19:12,279 --> 00:19:18,158
w I think you know the CIA there's a big

422
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:21,640
military coup in this country back on

423
00:19:18,159 --> 00:19:24,840
November 22nd

424
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:27,960
1963 most people don't realize it

425
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:30,119
yet well CIA took over hardened when

426
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:33,798
this CIA director took over the

427
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:36,519
government personally mhm in January of

428
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:38,359
1981 as the vice president of ronal

429
00:19:36,519 --> 00:19:40,839
dragon

430
00:19:38,359 --> 00:19:43,000
right he was involved in the Assassin I

431
00:19:40,839 --> 00:19:45,480
never saw too much air between Bill

432
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:48,759
Clinton and the CIA they seem to be

433
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:51,440
pretty close seems and my president now

434
00:19:48,759 --> 00:19:55,400
seems to be very close with the

435
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:57,720
CIA bad choice they the CIA were the

436
00:19:55,400 --> 00:20:00,519
people that didn't happen to see the

437
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:01,679
collapse of the Soviet Union coming

438
00:20:00,519 --> 00:20:05,480
although they've been watching it

439
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:05,480
through a microscope for 50

440
00:20:06,919 --> 00:20:12,919
years what kind of that you know yeah

441
00:20:10,359 --> 00:20:15,798
not much intelligence there the on that

442
00:20:12,919 --> 00:20:19,120
had the weapons of mass destruction why

443
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:21,918
we should go to Iraq for 10 years try to

444
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:24,199
bomb them into the Stone

445
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:25,880
Age they were sure that they had a

446
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:27,159
weapon of mass destruction because they

447
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:29,919
sold it to

448
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:32,000
them MH they didn't believe that they

449
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:35,640
had dismantled them when they were

450
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:38,558
supposed to evidently they did otherwise

451
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,559
they would have found

452
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:44,519

456
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:55,080
