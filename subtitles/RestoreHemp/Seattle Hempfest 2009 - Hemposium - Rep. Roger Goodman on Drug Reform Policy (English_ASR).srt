nationally with bar associations and all

other professional groups all across the

21
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:51,719
country to do the same thing they got

22
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:53,759
lawyers and particularly lawyers but

23
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:57,300
professionals to speak up

24
00:00:53,759 --> 00:01:00,058
about drug policy and give some courage

25
00:00:57,299 --> 00:01:01,679
to policy makers to take action and as

26
00:01:00,058 --> 00:01:03,119
Philip said I've also an elected

27
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:04,680
official and vice chair of the house

28
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:07,500
Judiciary Committee here in the

29
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:09,780
Washington State Legislature uh and in

30
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:12,359
that capacity I'm one of very few

31
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:14,099
lawyers in the legislature

32
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:17,700
um and my drug policy work in the

33
00:01:14,099 --> 00:01:19,500
legislature is uh at the salad bar or in

34
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,719
you know sort of rooms that you don't

35
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,299
you don't see my work in the legislature

36
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:27,000
it's very quiet very subtle uh so

37
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:29,759
testing the waters uh giving some of my

38
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,438
colleagues some uh different ways to

39
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,420
frame the issue that this isn't about

40
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:35,039
drugs this is about fiscal

41
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,478
responsibility this is about protecting

42
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,100
our children better this is about

43
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:40,140
providing Health Care this is about

44
00:01:38,099 --> 00:01:42,298
cleaning up public spaces and so forth

45
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:45,420
uh we're getting close to a Tipping

46
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:46,799
Point uh and so my quiet work in the

47
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,219
legislature is working with the other

48
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:52,200
suits uh but my not so quiet workout in

49
00:01:50,219 --> 00:01:54,179
the professional world and we're making

50
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:57,420
more noise now because

51
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:59,159
we're clearly at a point where drug

52
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,899
policy is not just a marginal issue

53
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:03,540
anymore it's it's really been mainstream

54
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:08,038
and folks understand uh that it's a

55
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:11,039
strategic issue so my off campus off the

56
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:12,539
capitol campus my work involves getting

57
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:14,219
those bar associations across the

58
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:16,979
country such as Colorado Wisconsin

59
00:02:14,219 --> 00:02:19,259
Massachusetts New York Massachusetts Bar

60
00:02:16,979 --> 00:02:20,639
Association just released a report to

61
00:02:19,259 --> 00:02:22,620
ago it's on the desk of every

62
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:25,019
Massachusetts state legislator and the

63
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:27,539
title is with a nice seal on it it says

64
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:28,920
failure of the War on Drugs charting a

65
00:02:27,539 --> 00:02:30,479
new course for the Commonwealth

66
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:32,159
Commonwealth of Massachusetts

67
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:34,019
you don't even have to open it

68
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:35,818
says the failure that we're on drugs and

69
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:37,200
it's on the desk of the state legislator

70
00:02:35,818 --> 00:02:38,759
so it's just sort of seeping into their

71
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:42,119
minds you know it's kind of what we're

72
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:44,039
doing is uh giving legislators a sense

73
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:47,039
that this is not an issue to be afraid

74
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:49,620
of uh and I'll make one more comment in

75
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:53,159
that a vein when I first ran for office

76
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:55,500
my opponent uh hit me hard on the drug

77
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:57,780
policy issue that I was going to be

78
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:00,739
selling drugs to kids you know I wanted

79
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:04,259
to be the state director of drug dealing

80
00:03:00,739 --> 00:03:06,500
uh all these sort of things and my poll

81
00:03:04,259 --> 00:03:09,318
numbers went up afterwards

82
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:12,598
okay so the people together

83
00:03:09,318 --> 00:03:14,579
so one final without a man two years

84
00:03:12,598 --> 00:03:17,339
later I ran for re-election against my

85
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:19,019
esteemed colleague Toby Nixon and please

86
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:21,439
give Toby a hand because he is a great

87
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:21,439
uh

88
00:03:22,378 --> 00:03:27,000
in my first election I was hit hard for

89
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:29,279
wanting to sell drugs to kids and I was

90
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,500
this evil guy to two years later I run

91
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,598
against an opponent who agrees with us

92
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:35,699
that we need to reform drug policy and

93
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:39,419
in public Toby criticized me for not

94
00:03:35,699 --> 00:03:42,179
being aggressive enough so in a two-year

95
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:44,039
period we've come a long way sir I think

96
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,840
I think that's uh that's fantastic

97
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:47,699
thanks a lot Roger it's a worthwhile

98
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,200
mentioning when I ran for office it was

99
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:50,579
uh I had no trouble at the medical

100
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:52,079
marijuana issue the fact that I

101
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:53,760
distribute medical marijuana never

102
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,440
became a political issue I had more

103
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:56,818
trouble uh convincing people to vote

104
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:59,098
green than to vote for a medical

105
00:03:56,818 --> 00:04:01,818
marijuana distributor it's a green Party

106
00:03:59,098 --> 00:04:01,818
candidate but
