1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,798
uh I bring you warnings from Washington

2
00:00:02,839 --> 00:00:06,759
you know

3
00:00:03,798 --> 00:00:09,359
502 uh passed they said it was

4
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:12,160
legalization we have exchanged criminal

5
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:14,160
prohibition for an economic one they

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,839
have grabbed the power of the plant away

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,960
from the people there is no home growing

8
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:23,320
unless you are a medical

9
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:23,320
patient if you

10
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:29,000
are if you're a licensed grower into the

11
00:00:26,278 --> 00:00:30,518
state system you can't even sample your

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,840
own product

13
00:00:30,518 --> 00:00:35,759
this is an iron gpon cannabis that we

14
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:39,160
have got to move past we have got

15
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:41,359
initiative 648 in Washington this year

16
00:00:39,159 --> 00:00:44,319
it's going to legalize hom growing at

17
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:48,960
the medical limits for anyone 21 and

18
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:52,519
older without tax fee license permit and

19
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,239
most importantly registry if it's a

20
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:57,800
legal product you shouldn't have to go

21
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:59,640
on a government list in order to have it

22
00:00:57,799 --> 00:01:00,518
okay we fix a couple other things too

23
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:04,198
thank you

24
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:06,920
you right now under 502 if you're under

25
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:09,319
21 hey I'm over 21 it's legal I can have

26
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:12,960
an ounce if you're under 21 you go to

27
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:16,599
jail the first step the first arrest

28
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:19,359
should be a ticket if you're under 21

29
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:22,118
over 18 you go see the judge if you're

30
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:24,039
under 18 you go with your parents and

31
00:01:22,118 --> 00:01:26,078
figure out what's up maybe your folks

32
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:28,640
don't know what's going on but if we're

33
00:01:26,078 --> 00:01:30,519
going to have it legal we don't want to

34
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,599
be arresting young people people and

35
00:01:30,519 --> 00:01:33,719
putting them into jail with thugs and

36
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:36,118
criminals and

37
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:38,599
molesters when we need just to get them

38
00:01:36,118 --> 00:01:42,399
into court with their

39
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:46,078
parents going to fix it so I got to tell

40
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:47,879
you last legislative session uh when 502

41
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:49,279
passed they didn't they they said oh we

42
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:51,199
won't affect medical at all we won't

43
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,399
affect medical the first thing The

44
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:57,118
Liquor Board tried to get shoved in

45
00:01:53,399 --> 00:02:01,118
there was to put medical into a system

46
00:01:57,118 --> 00:02:03,920
that does not even exist yet

47
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:06,718
this is problematic because so many

48
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:09,000
patients depend on their medicine I see

49
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:11,199
what's happening in Colorado they've

50
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,039
mixed the systems there I think that's a

51
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:16,919
bad move Rec should be recreational

52
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:19,039
medical should be medical when patients

53
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:20,878
need their medicine and go into a place

54
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:24,479
and find the wreck users have bought it

55
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:27,039
all up or driven the prices up so high

56
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:28,759
that they can't afford their medicine

57
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:32,318
what have we

58
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:35,239
done we have got to do this right in the

59
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:38,119
coming 10 years this country is going to

60
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:40,759
be legal but what will that legalization

61
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:43,439
look like will you be able to grow for

62
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:46,439
yourself or will you be forced to go pay

63
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:48,919
an exorbitant tax and face ARR rest if

64
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:51,079
you don't or should you be able to grow

65
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:52,719
your own share with your friends and

66
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:54,879
family just like you do the Bounty of

67
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:54,878
your

68
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,759
garden I know this is Oregon this is the

69
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:02,359
global

70
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:03,759
March tell your friends in Washington

71
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:06,720
sign

72
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:09,158
648 and something else you know we're

73
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:10,680
going to get some video out of today

74
00:03:09,158 --> 00:03:14,318
this is kind of like and the and the

75
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:16,040
March it's a great piece for about a 30

76
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:19,958
second sound bite on the

77
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:22,719
news what happened in Washington was our

78
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:24,680
lobbyists claiming to represent our

79
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:26,560
industry they were representing their

80
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:30,360
own special

81
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:32,920
interests our people wore red shirts we

82
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:35,519
sat in the legislature upstairs in The

83
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:39,878
Gallery at the end of the session right

84
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:41,879
up to the last few minutes they couldn't

85
00:03:39,878 --> 00:03:45,598
decide on how to kill

86
00:03:41,878 --> 00:03:48,679
medical we stopped them and we stopped

87
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:52,238
them by not just getting the sound bite

88
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:55,719
in the video we registered patients to

89
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:58,719
vote we got patients that had never

90
00:03:55,719 --> 00:04:00,479
talked to their legislators before to

91
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:03,639
write them emails

92
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:06,639
make phone calls go into their offices

93
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:09,399
and put a face on medical there were

94
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:11,598
legislators that said oh 90% of the

95
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:14,560
medical people are fakes they're just

96
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:16,639
wreck users that just want a smoke pie

97
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,358
well I want to tell you something I'm

98
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:21,120
also here to speak for patients like

99
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:23,839
William curs who has a degenerative

100
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:27,079
hereditary disease and I got to tell you

101
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:30,560
90% of the patients that I know in

102
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:33,240
Washington don't get out they can't

103
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:36,360
afford to get out they are physically

104
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:40,560
unable to get out they are too ill to

105
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:42,840
get out so we need to put our face in

106
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:45,959
front of the legislators we make we got

107
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:49,519
to make sure that they know that medical

108
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:53,198
is legitimate that recreational is not

109
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:56,519
harmful but the two must go ahead

110
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:59,160
separately to protect the best interests

111
00:04:56,519 --> 00:05:01,560
of the state and of the people and of

112
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,560
the p

113
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,038
make sure you're registered to vote sign

114
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:12,240
these initiatives and before we get to

115
00:05:08,038 --> 00:05:15,038

makes a difference to me and my

123
00:05:34,519 --> 00:05:40,560
represent what we want for

124
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,560
cannabis
