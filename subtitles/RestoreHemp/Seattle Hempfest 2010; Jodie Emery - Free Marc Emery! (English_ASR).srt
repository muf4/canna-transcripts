Seattle hand Fest has been so good to my

31
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:05,719
husband but has also been so good to you

32
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,240
to look at this and know that I'm

33
00:01:05,719 --> 00:01:09,959
standing in the United States of America

34
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:12,438
where millions of people are locked up

35
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:14,639
and arrested their lives ruined because

36
00:01:12,438 --> 00:01:16,839
of cannabis that you're able to have

37
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,280
this here where you can find out about

38
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:21,520
where to buy marijuana seeds and

39
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,960
meanwhile half an hour that way my

40
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:27,158
husband sits in a prison cell maximum

41
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:29,919
security awaiting sentencing for selling

42
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:31,118
seeds wasn't just selling seeds that

43
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,560
that got him in trouble because there's

44
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:36,239
a lot of people selling seeds but Mark

45
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:38,879
Emy the prince of pot as he was known

46
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:41,839
around the world through CNN National

47
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:44,718
Geographic Rolling Stone everybody knew

48
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:48,439
of Mark because he was the leader to

49
00:01:44,718 --> 00:01:50,559
many in the movement back in 1994 he

50
00:01:48,438 --> 00:01:53,959
went to Vancouver and he said this

51
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:56,159
movement needs money our enemy has

52
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:58,359
endless money the government the police

53
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,759
the prisons they've got all the money

54
00:01:58,359 --> 00:02:02,799
and we need money so we decided to sell

55
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:05,959
marijuana seeds and said every dollar I

56
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:07,560
raise will go back into the movement

57
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:10,000
every dollar will go towards medical

58
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:13,319
marijuana initiatives which he funded in

59
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,479
Colorado and Arizona and Washington DC

60
00:02:13,318 --> 00:02:17,000
he did federal class action lawsuits

61
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:19,119
against the government on behalf of

62
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,959
medical marijuana patients he sold

63
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:25,039
millions of seeds all across America

64
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:27,759
through California and every state to

65
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:30,039
help you grow your own medicine so you

66
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:31,919
wouldn't have to buy from the cartels

67
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:33,759
because Mark's mission was very clear

68
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:35,878
and he stated it with every order of

69
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:38,519
seeds he filled and every dollar he

70
00:02:35,878 --> 00:02:41,799
spent he wanted to plant the seeds of

71
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:44,599
freedom and overgrow the

72
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:46,840
government and his mission was to enable

73
00:02:44,598 --> 00:02:49,000
people to be free from this oppression

74
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:51,759
because a lot of people know about Mark

75
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,080
free Mark Emy Mark Emy the prince of pot

76
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:56,519
but there are thousands and thousands of

77
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,800
people who are in prison right now who

78
00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:00,680
nobody knows who they are nobody's

79
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:04,040
calling for their name or hanging a

80
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:07,719
banner up so even though it's horribly

81
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:09,239
depressing to be away from my loved one

82
00:03:07,719 --> 00:03:11,719
and to have him locked up here when he

83
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:14,080
was facing life in prison to take a

84
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:17,120
5-year plea deal so his two co- accused

85
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:20,400
didn't go to jail to know that he has

86
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:23,158
this much support represents that all

87
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,760
drug users and abusers and everybody

88
00:03:23,158 --> 00:03:27,598
who's suffering in the United States

89
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:29,239
prison industry is a victim of this War

90
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:31,119
on Drugs and it's got to end for

91
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:32,759
everybody so that's why he spent

92
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,200
millions of dollars and devoted all of

93
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:37,598
his time doing cannabis Culture magazine

94
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:40,039
pot TV was the first video streaming

95
00:03:37,598 --> 00:03:41,959
website he helped spread information he

96
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:44,639
ran in elections he funded the US

97
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:47,438
marijuana party millions and millions of

98
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:50,119
dollars went towards ending the war on

99
00:03:47,438 --> 00:03:53,000
drugs and when the DEA came into Canada

100
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:55,039
in 2005 and had him arrested on

101
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,158
conspiracy charges they said he was

102
00:03:55,039 --> 00:04:00,120
going to go to prison for 30 years to

103
00:03:57,158 --> 00:04:02,639
life but that it was a significant blow

104
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:04,840
to the marijuana legalization movement

105
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:07,839
they said that Mark hemry was targeted

106
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:09,479
for his legalization activities seeds

107
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,598
weren't even mentioned in the press

108
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:15,158
release so it's very clear that this US

109
00:04:12,598 --> 00:04:17,719
government and the DEA who's operating

110
00:04:15,158 --> 00:04:19,639
in countries all over the world is going

111
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:21,759
after the people who are fighting for

112
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:24,160
freedom because they don't care about

113
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,680
the real drug dealers or the cartels or

114
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,840
they would be able to solve that problem

115
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,400
what they care about is dissent and

116
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:32,599
calling for peace and tolerance and

117
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:34,799
freedom and no more government

118
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,479
oppression and so while I go and visit

119
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,759
my husband tomorrow morning and I tell

120
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:40,800

121
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:42,759
these people here celebrating Freedom

122
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,160

123
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:47,600

126
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:54,478
spread the word free Mark Emy because it

127
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:57,000
means free all the prisoners of the drug

128
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:59,959
war and that's what we've got to do so
