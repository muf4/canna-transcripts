5
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:15,320
up thank you um Vivian and Hest what a

6
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:18,559
wonderful celebration of personal

7
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:21,039
freedom it's it's fantastic to be here

8
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:24,640
let me start off by being honest with

9
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:26,359
you I smoke pot and I like it a lot okay

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:30,599
let's get

11
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:32,640
that I first smoked marijuana in 196 5

12
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:35,039
when I was a freshman at Georgetown law

13
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,359
school and I've been a regular marijuana

14
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:39,320
smoker ever since and I'm here to say

15
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:41,320
there's absolutely nothing wrong with

16
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:43,600
the responsible use of marijuana by

17
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,840
adults regardless of why you smoke it

18
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,760
and it should be none of the

19
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:48,880
government's business whether we smoke

20
00:00:46,759 --> 00:00:50,759
or why we smoke thank

21
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:53,520
[Music]

22
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:55,759
you normal is the marijuana smokers

23
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,920
Lobby in America we have been now for

24
00:00:55,759 --> 00:01:00,439
four decades we were founded it we

25
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,120
founded the organization in 1970

26
00:01:00,439 --> 00:01:04,118
we favor the elimination of all

27
00:01:02,119 --> 00:01:06,200
penalties for the responsible use of

28
00:01:04,118 --> 00:01:08,359
marijuana we also favor the

29
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,280
establishment of a legally regulated

30
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:11,719
market and you good folks here in

31
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,519
Washington are going to have a chance to

32
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:15,599
vote on an initiative like that in

33
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:17,959
November you may well be the first state

34
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:20,559
to actually fully legalize marijuana in

35
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:24,319
this country let's make it

36
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:26,280
happen and we also favor personal

37
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:27,758
cultivation that is that consumers

38
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,719
should have the right to grow their own

39
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:32,438
marijuana so that if the industry tries

40
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:34,560
to charge us too much or if the

41
00:01:32,438 --> 00:01:36,919
marijuana isn't good quality or if it's

42
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:40,478
not convenient screw them we will grow

43
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,478
our own just like we do

44
00:01:41,118 --> 00:01:47,359
now now what is important I think is

45
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:50,799
that for those of us who smoke marijuana

46
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:53,478
to Get Up Stand Up light up and let the

47
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:57,280
world know how we feel we must come out

48
00:01:53,478 --> 00:02:00,118
of the closet and demand our

49
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:02,759
rights we have to do that for a number

50
00:02:00,118 --> 00:02:04,840
reasons first we have to overcome a

51
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:06,840
negative stereotype that many older

52
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:09,360
Americans still have about marijuana

53
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,239
smokers we need to demonstrate that

54
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,239
marijuana smokers are just average

55
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:15,159
Americans who work hard who raise

56
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:17,319
families and who pay taxes and who

57
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:19,919
contribute in a positive way to their

58
00:02:17,318 --> 00:02:23,399
communities we are not criminals and we

59
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:26,479
should not be treated like criminals

60
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:28,439
amen just as gays and lesbians

61
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:31,199
demonstrated over the last two or three

62
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:33,800
decades they won rights in this country

63
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:35,759
largely by the courageous ability and

64
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:38,319
willingness of a lot of people to come

65
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:40,679
out of the closet to overcome a negative

66
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:44,119
stereotype well smokers have to do the

67
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:46,800
same thing so please there's nothing

68
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:49,319
wrong with smoking pot don't be afraid

69
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:52,439
to be identified as a pot smoker and in

70
00:02:49,318 --> 00:02:54,518
fact get involved politically don't vote

71
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:57,598
for a candidate for public office who

72
00:02:54,519 --> 00:03:00,360
wants to treat you like a criminal over

73
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:03,119
30 million Americans smoke pot just in

74
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:05,280
the last year if we would simply take

75
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,200
that pledge to stop voting for people

76
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,598
that wanted to treat us like criminals

77
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:11,639
we will change these laws in the next

78
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:15,000
couple of election

79
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:17,119
Cycles now very briefly prohibition is a

80
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,080
failed public policy for two or three

81
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:23,239
basic reasons one is we waste $1 billion

82
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:25,760
a year chasing and arresting and

83
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:28,840
Prosecuting marijuana smokers we arrest

84
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:31,798
850,000 people a year in this country

85
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:34,319
for marijuana fences another marijuana

86
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:36,519
smoker is arrested every 38 seconds in

87
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:39,359
America we've arrested 20 million

88
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:42,759
marijuana smokers just since

89
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:45,200
1965 so for Christ's sake just for that

90
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:47,878
reason let's move it aside but there's

91
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:50,399
even a conceptual reason most Americans

92
00:03:47,878 --> 00:03:53,199
agree the government has no business

93
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:56,438
coming into our house to know what books

94
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:58,238
we read to know uh what music we listen

95
00:03:56,438 --> 00:04:00,479
to or how we conduct oursel in the

96
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,280
privacy of the bedroom well neither do

97
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:04,158
they have any business coming into our

98
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:06,560
house to know whether we drink alcohol

99
00:04:04,158 --> 00:04:08,679
or smoke marijuana when we relax in the

100
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,280
evening it is simply none of their

101
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:13,480
business why is it illegal you going to

102
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:17,279
say so where does that leave us you

103
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:20,399
folks are on the verge of changing

104
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:23,799
policy that's been in place for 75 years

105
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:26,239
either Colorado California Washington

106
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:28,720
Oregon or Massachusetts almost certainly

107
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,879
one of those States maybe more are going

108
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:34,320
to fully legal Iz marijuana in November

109
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:36,918
of 2012 you people have an excellent

110
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:40,319
chance to do that you will change the

111
00:04:36,918 --> 00:04:43,240
world if you help us accomplish that and

112
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:45,959
in the in the end it is important to

113
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:48,360
keep in mind we're only incidentally

114
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:52,159
talking about marijuana we're really

115
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:54,800
talking about personal freedom so get up

116
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,960
light up support normal and let's

117
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,000
restore a measure of personal freedom to

118
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:00,159
the lives of tens of millions of

119
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,670
marijuana
