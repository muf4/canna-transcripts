1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:06,640
I'm not one for trying to find new ways

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:09,359
to do something that has already been

3
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:12,718
done and what what I mean by that we

4
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:15,000
were here once before with alcohol

5
00:00:12,718 --> 00:00:18,879
prohibition

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,359
and for instance the last call a book by

7
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:24,960
Daniel Kent you know and in reading that

8
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:26,920
and looking at how alcohol prohibition

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,480
came to an end

10
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:31,199
and the groups that were involved and

11
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:33,160
how they went about doing it you know

12
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,200
the the mothers that came forward you

13
00:00:33,159 --> 00:00:37,439
know protecting their children we have a

14
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,879
similar thing

15
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:43,399
today there are many many as not many

16
00:00:40,878 --> 00:00:45,599
many different groups many different

17
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:49,600
perspective many different reasons for

18
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:52,399
being here at the table to end

19
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,399
prohibition of

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,600
marijuana and we have to

21
00:00:55,719 --> 00:01:02,760
ensure that we are working well together

22
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:05,840
and well oiled machine because a lot has

23
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:07,519
to be done a lot has to be done

24
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,880
politically at the end of the day what

25
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:13,239
we want to do is to remove marijuana

26
00:01:09,879 --> 00:01:15,640
from a schedule one category and in my

27
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:18,560
opinion remove it from the scheduling

28
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,560
system all

29
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:27,798
together and you

30
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:30,478
know so how does that happen you know

31
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:33,479
I'm not going to

32
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:35,039
you know reiterate what dominic already

33
00:01:33,478 --> 00:01:37,078
talked about but but how does that

34
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,000
happen how do we do that all right we

35
00:01:37,078 --> 00:01:41,679
have two states right now right here in

36
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,670
Washington in Colorado have

37
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,240
begun to

38
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:50,359
[Music]

39
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:53,118
move there are 48 other

40
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:54,799
states that are going to move in a

41
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:56,319
similar Direction the question is how

42
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,759
would he do it and how quickly will they

43
00:01:56,319 --> 00:02:00,158
do

44
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:02,319
it one of the things that I think is

45
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,799
important as many of us here are from

46
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:07,000
other parts of the country is that we

47
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:10,280
have to connect the dots we have to go

48
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,239
back to our states we have to talk about

49
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:15,080
this yes at the kitchen tables and in

50
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:16,959
our own individual circles but we have

51
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:19,599
to make those connections to the people

52
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:21,920
who would be responsible in our home

53
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:25,159
States for make for doing what's

54
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:27,159
Happening Here the city attorneys for

55
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:29,359
instance in I'm from earland in

56
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:31,799
Baltimore I want to give some examples

57
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:36,800
here in Baltimore where the City

58
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:39,439
attorney is uh Mr Bernstein you know I

59
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,879
know Mr bernin and I know Pete Holmes

60
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:44,439
here is my responsibility to connect

61
00:02:41,878 --> 00:02:47,079
those two people so that they can begin

62
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:48,840
a dialogue so that Mr Bernstein can

63
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:51,239
learn from Pete Holmes as to what's

64
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,959
happening in Seattle what differences

65
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:55,878
are being made how's that occurring who

66
00:02:53,959 --> 00:03:00,120
needs to be involved City Council

67
00:02:55,878 --> 00:03:02,120
Members connecting those folks as well

68
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:05,000
doctors from Maryland need to be

69
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:06,959
speaking with doctors here in Washington

70
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,919
the liquor control board folks need to

71
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,158
be communicating from Maryland to

72
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:13,199
Washington State in Colorado you know

73
00:03:11,158 --> 00:03:15,598
however it's being

74
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:18,039
done and I think that's an important

75
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:20,598
piece of it because I know people are in

76
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:22,439
other states just people who have the

77
00:03:20,598 --> 00:03:25,119
power to make things happen in it you're

78
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:26,919
wonder you're wondering so what's going

79
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,239
on out there in Washington state and

80
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:29,798
they're developing their own

81
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,680
perspectives about what is happen

82
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:35,480
happening in Washington state in

83
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:38,280
Colorado we can't allow them to do that

84
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:40,959
we can't allow them

85
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:45,000
to

86
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:47,560
create myths and rumors and inuendo and

87
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,039
monsters we need to show them what's

88
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:52,199
happening here and that the sky is not

89
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:55,400
falling in Washington

90
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:59,479
state you know so those are just some

91
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:02,480
examples currently we have momentum in

92
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:05,719
what's occurring with marijuana policy

93
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:08,878
reform in this country and we cannot

94
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:08,878
afford to lose

95
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:17,600
it the only way that we can lose it in

96
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:20,720
my opinion is if we don't work together

97
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,600
as a team in making this happen and I'm

98
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,560
going to continue to say this every time

99
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:27,160
I have an opportunity because in the

100
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:30,319
past I've seen

101
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:33,320
infighting among all of us that want to

102
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:36,038
legalize marijuana day want to remove it

103
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:39,800
from the scheduling system and we have

104
00:04:36,038 --> 00:04:41,719
to get beyond our own individual

105
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:45,560
differences we have to leave that

106
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:47,440
baggage outside you can pick it up when

107
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:49,079
you leave when we're all done when we

108
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:51,600
end prohibition of marijuana you can

109
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:54,038
pick it up and carry it around again if

110
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,560
you want but for this moment for this

111
00:04:54,038 --> 00:05:01,209
effort here you've got to leave it

112
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,350
outside you've got to do that

113
00:05:01,209 --> 00:05:03,000
[Music]

114
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:06,520
[Applause]

115
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:09,399
so I'll end with this you know the moms

116
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:10,758
need to support the cops that want to

117
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:12,439
get this done and there are a lot of

118
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:14,560
cops that want to get it done believe it

119
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:18,639
or not and they're all not members of

120
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:20,800
leap you know the cops need to support

121
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,800
uh those who just want the right to

122
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,360
enjoy

123
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,879
cannabis those who just want to enjoy

124
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:31,000
cannabis need to support those who come

125
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:33,560
to here to this place a medical

126
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,399
perspective those who come to this place

127
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:38,240
from a religious perspective and the

128
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:39,799
many different places we come from we

129
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:43,120
have to support each

130
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:45,800
other keep the momentum going and share

131
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:48,759
what's happening here in Washington and

132
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:51,639
Colorado not just with other states in

133
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:54,800
the union but we we're already beginning

134
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:58,400
to see what's happening outside of this

135
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:00,319
country in other countries like in

136
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:02,000
Central America

137
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,960
with

138
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,680
Uruguay the move that you're seeing in

139
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:11,680
Uruguay is because of what happened

140
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,680
here

141
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:19,440
[Music]

142
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:19,439
here that's my two cents thanks
