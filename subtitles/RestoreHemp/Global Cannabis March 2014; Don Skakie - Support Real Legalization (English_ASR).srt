1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:07,280
write them emails make phone calls go

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:10,280
into their offices and put a face on

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:13,280
medical there were legislators that said

4
00:00:10,279 --> 00:00:14,919
oh 90% of the medical people are fakes

5
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:17,640
they're just wreck users that just want

6
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:19,759
to smoke pie well I want to tell you

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,439
something I'm also here to speak for

8
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:25,199
patients like William kurs who has a

9
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:27,839
degenerative hereditary disease and I

10
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:32,320
got to tell you 90% of the patients that

11
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:34,679
I know in Washington don't get out they

12
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,359
can't afford to get out they are

13
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:41,920
physically unable to get out they are

14
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:44,679
too ill to get out so we need to put our

15
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:47,280
face in front of the legislators we make

16
00:00:44,679 --> 00:00:51,000
we got to make sure that they know that

17
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:55,239
medical is legitimate that recreational

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,558
is not harmful but the two must go ahead

19
00:00:55,238 --> 00:01:01,159
separately to protect the best interests

20
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:03,039
of the state and and of the people and

21
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:05,438
