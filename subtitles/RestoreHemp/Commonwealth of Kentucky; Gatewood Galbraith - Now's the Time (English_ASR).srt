1
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:10,440
but we have a hell of a chance of

2
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:11,920
winning in November our primaries are

3
00:00:10,439 --> 00:00:14,439
this coming Tuesday we're not in the

4
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:17,320
primary we're totally

5
00:00:14,439 --> 00:00:20,118
independent and what interest you may

6
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:23,198
have in what how I do out there in that

7
00:00:20,118 --> 00:00:25,399
race is that we're going to take a giant

8
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:29,160
leap we're going to take a giant leap

9
00:00:25,399 --> 00:00:31,000
we're going to go all the way to find

10
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:34,159
out whether America still has a pulse or

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,399
not and we're going to do it

12
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:38,319
constitutionally the United States

13
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:39,878
Constitution does not provide you the

14
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,679
right to life liberty and pursuit of

15
00:00:39,878 --> 00:00:43,878
happiness that's in Independence

16
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:47,039
Declaration of Independence that's not

17
00:00:43,878 --> 00:00:48,839
law so you don't officially have a right

18
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,960
to that under federal

19
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:54,559
law but Kentucky has a constitution also

20
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,558
just like all the other states do but

21
00:00:54,558 --> 00:00:59,439
just so happens that kuy's Constitution

22
00:00:56,558 --> 00:01:01,078
is the most Pro people Constitution ever

23
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:03,799
written

24
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:05,599
that I people back in 1890 got so tired

25
00:01:03,799 --> 00:01:07,079
of being raped by the railroad companies

26
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:09,438
that they wrote a constitution that

27
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:11,239
protected the people and kept

28
00:01:09,438 --> 00:01:12,399
corporations from being running rough

29
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:14,640
shot over

30
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,920
everybody and even now that's beginning

31
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:20,319
to fracture as our legislature keep

32
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,640
selling out to to the uh to the uh folks

33
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:23,239
that I call the petrochemical

34
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:25,040
pharmaceutical military industrial

35
00:01:23,239 --> 00:01:27,438
transnational corporate fascist Elite

36
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,439
son of a

37
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:31,839
[Applause]

38
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,840


39
00:01:33,078 --> 00:01:40,000
so uh what's going to happen is that the

40
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:42,599
very first section of ky's constitution

41
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,599
ensures that its citizens

42
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:47,679
constitutionally are

43
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:50,199
endowed with the right to life liberty

44
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,000
and the pursuit to happiness that's the

45
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:54,320
number one section in Kentucky

46
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,438
Constitution so I feel obliged to make

47
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:59,239
it the number one basis of policy for my

48
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:01,959
relationship of government to the people

49
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:04,478
and state of Kentucky I'm going to get

50
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:05,798
it off of their bikes I'm going to take

51
00:02:04,478 --> 00:02:07,319
it out of the bedrooms and the

52
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:09,399
bloodstreams and the brains and the

53
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:10,799
bladders the billfolds and back pockets

54
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:13,519
the internet bulletin boards and put

55
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:16,599
them back in the little box where they

56
00:02:13,519 --> 00:02:19,599
belong I'm going to make government not

57
00:02:16,598 --> 00:02:21,839
a burden on the people I think it's the

58
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:24,079
role of government to uplift Enlighten

59
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,560
educate and endow

60
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,640
people with an appreciation of Life

61
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,759
appreciation of the social compact there

62
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:32,679
civil duties

63
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:34,959
their civil

64
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:37,200
responsibilities and make sure that we

65
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:40,400
have address them as Sovereign human

66
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:44,479
beings capable making their own

67
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:46,840
decisions so if we can do this if I can

68
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:50,560
win this it's going to be bigger than

69
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:52,439
Ventura it' be next to Obama's election

70
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,039
because there is no there was a an

71
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:56,199
independent elected governor Rhode

72
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:58,759
Island in this past one the first one

73
00:02:56,199 --> 00:03:01,679
elected in 150 years but he had been a

74
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:03,719
state senator he had been a federal US

75
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,400
senator from State of Rhode Island so he

76
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:09,318
had that base okay but we'll be the

77
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,840
first truly independent ticket ever to

78
00:03:09,318 --> 00:03:16,359
uh ever to uh win governor in state of

79
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:18,759

of freedom in America he'd ever read on

98
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:55,560
the same day an 18-year-old girl from

the middle of the mountains called me

100

America for 11 month 11 weeks so uh I

104
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:12,158
left out 100% of the sex and 80% of the

105
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:12,158
drugs but it's still a kickass read
