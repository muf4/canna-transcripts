1
00:00:28,839 --> 00:00:31,839
do

2
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:46,718
and the earth is our mother

3
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:52,878
and the land is her flesh

4
00:00:53,198 --> 00:01:02,479
and the water and the water is her milk

5
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:05,599
and the oil is her blood

6
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:13,679
and we are

7
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:17,599
her children in this land

8
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:20,880
we come from of this earth

9
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:24,319
we're made of with us

10
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:29,519
as future ancestors given

11
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:29,519
response abilities to live

12
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:39,359
we are the future we bring

13
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:42,798
if we don't take care of the land

14
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:48,158
how can the land take care of us

15
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:48,159
same with sky and air we breathe

16
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:55,679
today is time

17
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:59,759
to remember tomorrow

18
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:02,880
in the reality of we reap what we sow

19
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:04,560
the reality of land and life is in the

20
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:09,840
sea

21
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,840
sea as memory memory of life

22
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:19,120
wild seed memory keeping alive alive

23
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,800
up close face to face with the

24
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:25,360
destroyers

25
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:28,560
and their synthetic sea without memory

26
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:32,080
toxic planting poison in earth

27
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:37,039
and minds disregarding

28
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:42,239
well-being for maximizing profits

29
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:42,239
abandoning the children to massive debt

30
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:49,039
making the price of freedom unaffordable

31
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:50,238
at the expense of the many for the

32
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:52,719
benefit

33
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,719
of the few

34
00:02:54,239 --> 00:03:03,120
like a spreading mad human disease

35
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:07,360
chaosing minds with liar's promises

36
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:12,480
seeding old fears with new fears

37
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:12,480
life in the world of the money man

38
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:19,920
it's time to think

39
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:23,040
our way out of what we believed

40
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:26,238
our way into how

41
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:33,840
can we show respect to life

42
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:33,840
if we don't use our common sense

43
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:53,360
is her flesh and the water

44
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:57,039
is her milk and the oil

45
00:03:53,360 --> 00:04:01,840
is her blood and we

46
00:03:57,039 --> 00:04:01,840
are her children

47
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,918
you
