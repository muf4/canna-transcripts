8
00:00:24,599 --> 00:00:32,320

00:00:27,518 --> 00:00:32,320

try the questions already have an answer

11
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:43,320
for the

12
00:00:39,878 --> 00:00:47,198
answer who is it took the creation

13
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:51,159
story claimed it then took it

14
00:00:47,198 --> 00:00:54,320
apart glorifying obedience and

15
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:55,558
fear rampaging through the heart

16
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,480
stamping

17
00:00:55,558 --> 00:01:01,959
uncertainty into the

18
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:04,280

00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:06,519
something about the

20
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:09,960
