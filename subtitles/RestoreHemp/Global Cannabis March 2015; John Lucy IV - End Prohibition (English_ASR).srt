1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:05,459
so 2015

2
00:00:03,779 --> 00:00:09,959
July 1st

3
00:00:05,459 --> 00:00:12,419
it's legal we did it we actually did it

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,400
it's done we're gonna make it better

5
00:00:12,419 --> 00:00:15,660
Russ talked about all the areas that

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,640
we've got to make better and Russ has

7
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:19,320
actually got my banner thank you thanks

8
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,760
for us

9
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,278
um

10
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,720
I've gone in the course of my career

11
00:00:23,278 --> 00:00:26,698
I've been doing marijuana politics

12
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:29,219
marijuana policy and marijuana law for

13
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:30,720
the last 15 plus years

14
00:00:29,219 --> 00:00:32,820
um I've gone in the course of my career

15
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:35,579
from doing almost exclusively criminal

16
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:37,320
defense every day I would wake up and

17
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:38,759
deal with somebody who had gotten busted

18
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,340
somebody who had to talk to the police

19
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:44,039
somebody who had a friend in jail a

20
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,780
parent in jail a child in jail

21
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:47,280
there were so many people every day who

22
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,379
came to me because somebody was in jail

23
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,420
was in custody was facing Court was

24
00:00:49,378 --> 00:00:53,460
facing jail was facing prison was facing

25
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:56,280
trial I can tell you today I have less

26
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:58,259
than 10 criminal cases right now

27
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:01,558
okay

28
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:04,079
that's a big change most of the work I

29
00:01:01,558 --> 00:01:06,179
do at this point isn't for people who

30
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:08,158
are looking at going to prison it's for

31
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:11,640
people who are looking at opening a

32
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:13,799
business paying their taxes being an

33
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,200
above-board member of society who can

34
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:18,118
walk into an establishment and say yeah

35
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,799
I'm in the marijuana industry that's

36
00:01:18,118 --> 00:01:22,140
what I do

37
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:24,720
um and that change in the last 15 years

38
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:26,340
has been Monumental I remember when

39
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:28,140
people even mentioning the word

40
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:29,939
marijuana people would walk away from

41
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:32,280
you people would literally distance

42
00:01:29,938 --> 00:01:34,379
themselves from you in public the other

43
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,000
day I was on a flight I was coming back

44
00:01:34,379 --> 00:01:38,339
from Colorado it's coming back from The

45
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,420
High Times Cannabis Cup

46
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:45,240
um and someone on the plane said hey

47
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:47,519
I think someone has a skunk on board

48
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:49,618
and called a flight attendant it was an

49
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:51,599
it was a very nice older lady she said I

50
00:01:49,618 --> 00:01:53,938
think there's a skunk on the plane

51
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:55,379
and the gentleman behind her started

52
00:01:53,938 --> 00:01:57,898
laughing and about half the plane

53
00:01:55,379 --> 00:01:59,819
started laughing because almost everyone

54
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:03,599
on that flight was coming back from

55
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:05,158
Denver from the cup to Portland and they

56
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:07,319
and the flight attendant looked around

57
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:09,300
and she said no it's illegal to have

58
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:10,978
marijuana on the plane but I'm sure that

59
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:13,140
everyone who had marijuana back in

60
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:15,239
Denver left it in Denver and we all went

61
00:02:13,139 --> 00:02:18,318
yes flight attendant of course we left

62
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:20,520
our marijuana back in Denver

63
00:02:18,318 --> 00:02:22,318
and so I want to explain to this very

64
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:24,300
nice lady that's what marijuana smelled

65
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:26,458
like and we all went about our day and

66
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:28,980
laughed nowhere Marshall jumped up

67
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:30,900
nobody was in handcuffs nobody was on

68
00:02:28,979 --> 00:02:33,060
the ground being searched nobody was

69
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:36,120
detained from the flight none of those

70
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:37,620
things happened and 10 years ago

71
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,819
all those things would have been

72
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,439
happening

73
00:02:38,818 --> 00:02:43,738
okay

74
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:45,780
um so I want to tell you today I I am so

75
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:47,640
happy to be here I'm so happy to have

00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:49,080

79
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:56,518
happy that moving forward we're gonna

80
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:58,739
make things better legalization's gonna

81
00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:00,420
come legalization is going to get better

82
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:02,039
each and every year and it's going to

83
00:03:00,419 --> 00:03:04,139
require each and every one of you who's

84
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:06,419
here today to do the same thing that

85
00:03:04,139 --> 00:03:09,119
we've been doing for years and years and

86
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:11,098
decades and that's fight and then stand

87
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,719
up and say you know what we're

88
00:03:11,098 --> 00:03:15,719
responsible productive members of

89
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:17,219
society we choose to use marijuana we

90
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:19,080
may use that instead of something else

91
00:03:17,219 --> 00:03:21,359
we may drink a beer and have a joint

92
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,920
sometimes but for everybody who wants to

93
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,200
be a responsible adult marijuana

94
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:26,639
consumer this is what freedom is going

95
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:27,719
to look like it's going to look like a

96
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:29,759
world where you don't have to look over

97
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:31,378
your shoulder it's going to look like a

98
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:34,139
world where you don't have to call me at

99
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:37,378
3am and have someone bail you out of

100
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:41,039
jail because you had an had 29 grams

101
00:03:37,378 --> 00:03:44,818
instead of 28.3 that was a money last

102
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:47,219
year okay a felony that meant that you

103
00:03:44,818 --> 00:03:48,598
were a felon for a very long time in the

104
00:03:47,219 --> 00:03:50,400
state of Oregon you were on probation

105
00:03:48,598 --> 00:03:51,419
you were paying fines you were paying in

106
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,239
a cup

107
00:03:51,419 --> 00:03:56,098
as of July 1st you can have a half pound

108
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:59,099
of marijuana in your home and I agree

109
00:03:56,098 --> 00:04:00,839
with Russ 100 okay I think marijuana

110
00:03:59,098 --> 00:04:02,219
consumers should be treated equally I

111
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,140
think we should have the same rights and

112
00:04:02,219 --> 00:04:05,939
that's going to take some time but you

113
00:04:04,139 --> 00:04:07,859
also need to remember there are places

114
00:04:05,939 --> 00:04:09,780
in this country where eight ounces of

115
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:10,739
marijuana will send you to [ __ ]

116
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:13,438
prison

117
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:15,539
okay and we're gonna be in a place where

118
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:17,099
that's not gonna happen and what we've

119
00:04:15,539 --> 00:04:19,319
got to do is we've got to work here to

120
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:20,699
make it better and for those of us and I

121
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:22,139
don't know if you know this but given

122
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:23,280
I'm wearing a seersucker suit you might

123
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:25,199
have guessed them from the south I'm

124
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:27,000
originally from North Carolina

125
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,978
there are places where marijuana is

126
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,478
still deeply illegal the amount of

127
00:04:28,978 --> 00:04:32,639
marijuana that you're allowed to possess

128
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:34,139
in this state can send you to prison for

129
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,400
the rest of your natural life in the

130
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:38,639
state of Mississippi

131
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:40,560
okay no parole no probation no nothing

132
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,939
you're going to prison and you're

133
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,439
staying there for the rest of your life

134
00:04:41,939 --> 00:04:44,699
so for everyone who's lived here

135
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:46,500
everyone who's grown up here everyone

136
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:48,300
who's worked so hard here whenever you

137
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,439
talk to someone who's not from here make

138
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,360
sure you explain to them that it's

139
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:54,779
possible it's workable you can make

140
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:56,639
changes we saw Oklahoma and Georgia both

141
00:04:54,779 --> 00:05:00,138
pass medical marijuana bills this year

142
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,139
let me repeat that Oklahoma

143
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:04,918
Georgia both Southern States states that

144
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,360
we did not expect to see any traction

145
00:05:04,918 --> 00:05:08,039
and they're not perfect bills don't get

146
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,560
me wrong I I don't want to pretend they

147
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:13,139
are but change does not come in one Fell

148
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,300
Swoop okay things are made day by day

149
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:16,500
this Plaza was not made by every single

150
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:18,660
one of these bricks instantly

151
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:21,478
materializing in front of us okay this

152
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:23,460
Plaza was made by people one brick at a

153
00:05:21,478 --> 00:05:25,079
time putting these bricks in place and

154
00:05:23,459 --> 00:05:27,000
the only way that we move forward the

155
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:28,680
only way that we make this happen is

156
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,600
that each and every one of us Works each

157
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:32,519
day to make things a little better every

158
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,680
day I wake up and I deal with marijuana

159
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:36,000
law there's not a day of my life that I

160
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,459
have not thought about or dealt with

161
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,139
marijuana okay and I'm not asking

162
00:05:38,459 --> 00:05:41,819
everybody here to do that I'm not asking

163
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:44,160
everybody here to be an activist every

164
00:05:41,819 --> 00:05:45,839
single day for eight hours a day but if

165
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,120
you can be an activist for five minutes

166
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:49,859
a day even something as simple as

167
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,060
calling your elected representative when

168
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:52,919
you're listening to Russ's show

169
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:54,720
something as simple as sending an email

170
00:05:52,918 --> 00:05:57,418
once a week you know what and if you

171
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,100
can't do that donate some money put it

172
00:05:57,418 --> 00:06:01,019
on your credit card make it an automatic

173
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:02,820
deposit make it an automatic every month

174
00:06:01,019 --> 00:06:04,319
you don't have to think about it what is

175
00:06:02,819 --> 00:06:05,879
it worth to be able to walk down the

176
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,139
street have an ounce of marijuana in

177
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:10,259
your pocket and never have to think

178
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:11,579
about a Cop arresting you ever again

179
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:14,819
okay

180
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:16,500
that's important finally there are still

181
00:06:14,819 --> 00:06:18,360
things that can get you arrested there

182
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:20,160
are still crimes most of the people I

183
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,840
represent most of the cases I deal with

184
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,220
they are high level cases they are the

185
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:25,079
sort of cases that most of you will

186
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:27,419
never contemplate will never consider

187
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:29,219
but frankly if you've ever bought

188
00:06:27,418 --> 00:06:31,019
marijuana on the black market or you've

189
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:32,699
ever received marijuana it had to come

190
00:06:31,019 --> 00:06:34,079
from somewhere someone had to grow it

191
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:35,520
someone had to make it and there's a

192
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:37,379
bunch of people who've been taking a lot

193
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:38,818
of risks over the years and a lot of

194
00:06:37,379 --> 00:06:42,000
those people are the people I represent

195
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:43,740
and the people I still represent so one

196
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,240
thing I want to remind everybody of is

197
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:47,460
how to be safe how to stay out of

198
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:49,439
trouble I'm sure most of you have seen

199
00:06:47,459 --> 00:06:50,939
one of my cards or one of my lighters or

200
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:52,620
you've seen Paul's card you've seen

201
00:06:50,939 --> 00:06:54,000
Paul's lighter and I just want to remind

202
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:56,160
everybody of what it says because

203
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,959
frankly even if you do have a legal

204
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,460
amount of marijuana in your pocket it

205
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:00,959
doesn't mean you've got to consent to a

206
00:06:59,459 --> 00:07:02,339
police search it doesn't mean you've got

207
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:03,359
to talk to them or deal with them if you

208
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:05,159
don't want to

209
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,720
I always tell people remember to be

210
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,039
polite and we're going to go through it

211
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:12,080
so

212
00:07:08,038 --> 00:07:12,079
am I free to go officer

213
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:17,000
if I am being detained

214
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:21,259
I do not consent to any searches

215
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:25,638
and I want to speak to my attorney

216
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:32,579
prior to answering any questions

217
00:07:29,459 --> 00:07:34,318
I give these away I put myself out of

218
00:07:32,579 --> 00:07:36,300
business every day and that's my goal

219
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:38,220
one day I hope to not have to do this

220
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:39,900
for criminals I hope to be doing this

221
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:41,400
for law-abiding citizens who want to

222
00:07:39,899 --> 00:07:43,679
make the world a better place and share

223
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:45,000
with their community so remember this if

224
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,079
you need a lighter grab them from the

225
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,079
table I give them away for free
