to say thank you very much to Vivien who

20
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:53,558
started all this 19 years ago and had

21
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:55,719
the foresight to bring us where we are

22
00:00:53,558 --> 00:00:58,238
today cuz I don't know if if it wasn't

23
00:00:55,719 --> 00:01:00,480
for what Hempfest is if we would even

24
00:00:58,238 --> 00:01:03,000
have the consciousness of hemp in the

25
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:04,518
world today you know Hemp Fest I say

26
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,319
give yourself a round of applause cuz

27
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:09,719
you're leading the world right

28
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:11,599
now you know and I want to say thank you

29
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:13,039
I did do 5 years in prison and and like

30
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:15,519
I just said to Vivian after every

31
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,360
Hempfest I would get hundreds of letters

32
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:19,798
from people and it would blow me away

33
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:21,719
that so many people cared not not for me

34
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:22,960
but for some stranger that was

35
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:24,478
representing something that they

36
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:27,039
believed

37
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:28,640
in what we're really looking at man is

38
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,280
that we got to support one another and

39
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,959
we're the community and we're trying to

40
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:33,200
make the change and the only way we can

41
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:34,879
make the world a better place is if

42
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,560
we're nicer to each other and when

43
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:38,759
Vivian was just saying about trash right

44
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,439
now you know the answer is obvious bro

45
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:42,319
if everybody packed up a little piece of

46
00:01:40,438 --> 00:01:44,359
trash and threw it away when they got up

47
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:46,118
there would be none on the ground you

48
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:48,799
know and if we cleaned up the problems

49
00:01:46,118 --> 00:01:52,359
of our ancestors so to speak people that

50
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:54,680
gave these drug wars to us like in' 68

51
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:56,920
before a lot of us were born I think

52
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:59,200
it's time to end the hypocrisy it's time

53
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:01,519
to change the world and I think we can

54
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,759
do that by resisting all of this you

55
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:06,158
know Tim Larry used to say turn on tune

56
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:08,239
in drop out and I think he was only kind

57
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:11,719
of right cuz I think we should turn on

58
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:14,039
tune in but take over and change what we

59
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:16,519
don't like be the change we want to see

60
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:18,840
in the world and you know what when they

61
00:02:16,519 --> 00:02:20,159
came at me for growing marijuana my own

62
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,360
medical marijuana cuz when I was a

63
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:25,680
little boy I had cancer I cancered 10

64
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:27,440
times as a child it totally sucked but

65
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,360
when I was nine my mother thought I was

66
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:30,759
dying so she started giving me medical

67
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,040
marijuana wanted to use while I was

68
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:35,799
going through chemotherapy and radiation

69
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:38,079
and it profoundly changed my life you

70
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:40,360
know and it kind of drove me to the

71
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:43,440
activist that I am today because I've

72
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:45,519
always sought truth and what we're all

73
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:47,000
doing here today is a representative of

74
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,039
that truth what we're all trying to do

75
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,199
is represent a reality that's been

76
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:54,639
stolen from us and hidden from us and

77
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:56,799
you know as Vivan said I'm now sadly and

78
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:59,359
I will say sadly the editor of the emper

79
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,519
wears no clothes because Jack was like a

80
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,840
dad to me me and he taught me all this

81
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:08,120
stuff about activism and I spent a lot

82
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:10,280
of time on the road with him and that

83
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:12,039
book had such a profound change on my

84
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,640
existence because nothing else in my

85
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:15,120
history when I went to class and I was

86
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:17,719
in school I thought this [ __ ] was so

87
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,920
boring it had no connection to me and

88
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:21,878
then Jack showed me that cotton wasn't

89
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:24,878
the first Fabric and that paper was

90
00:03:21,878 --> 00:03:27,000
invented 5,000 years ago using H and

91
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:28,560
that when Randolph diesel made a a

92
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,598
diesel engine he thought it would fit

93
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,400
into our ecosystem that the farmers

94
00:03:30,598 --> 00:03:34,878
would be able to plow the crops that

95
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,920
made the fuel that pushed the machine

96
00:03:34,878 --> 00:03:39,280
that plowed the crops and only in the

97
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:41,280
last 100 years as these pharmaceutical

98
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,560
companies and petrochemical companies

99
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,878
come in and taking away our natural

100
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,840
alternatives to things like medicine and

101
00:03:45,878 --> 00:03:50,000
things like fuel the only way we're

102
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,759
going to change things is resist this

103
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,318
[ __ ] and we take the power back really

104
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:56,878
it's ours you know hempest is really a

105
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:58,318
representative of this community and

106
00:03:56,878 --> 00:04:00,399
this community could do this all the

107
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:02,399
time if we got together put our heads

108
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,560
together we could end this drug war we

109
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,480
could end this hysteria there used to be

110
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,680
a time 100 years ago when you couldn't

111
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:12,039
find him in every house man and you know

112
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,200
now you can't find it in any house

113
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:15,878
because they've given us all these

114
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:17,478
synthetic solutions that don't work and

115
00:04:15,878 --> 00:04:20,358
the only way we're actually going to do

116
00:04:17,478 --> 00:04:22,560
this is if we do it break the law commit

117
00:04:20,358 --> 00:04:24,359
Civil Disobedience and if they come at

118
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,120
you saying we're going to lock you up

119
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:29,000
say good you know you locked up Gandhi

120
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,280
you locked up Martin Luther King you

121
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,879
locked up

122
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:34,719
and at the end of the game you look

123
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:36,519
stupid for doing it so go to prison

124
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,639
don't be afraid to spend a few nights in

125
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:41,519
a prison cell reading books because you

126
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,918
know what break the system literally

127
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:46,319
stand up against it and when you're done

128
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:48,279
with them laugh and walk away since I

129
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:50,360
got out of prison I have helped

130
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:52,159
marijuana policy project throw three

131
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:55,360
parties at the Playboy Mansion for

132
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:57,600
marijuana we've had

133
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,919
play and you know and our whole point of

134
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,680
doing that is because we're trying to

135
00:04:58,918 --> 00:05:02,519
get together all the artists and all

136
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:04,840
these creative people because we're not

137
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:06,639
this stupid stereotype we're not these

138
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:08,758
morons that they want to make us out to

139
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,519
be you know we're people that care we're

140
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:12,120
people that are conscious we're people

141
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:14,279
that are enlightened we're people that

142
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:17,199
are talented and we got to break the

143
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:20,279
stereotype we got to stop acting like

144
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:22,560
they want us to which is to be scared

145
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:24,839
and to be complacent and to do what

146
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,199
you're told so anything I'm telling you

147
