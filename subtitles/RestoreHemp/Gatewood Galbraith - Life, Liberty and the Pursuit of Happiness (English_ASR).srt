Reform Party candidate for governor

pretty

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,079
phenomenal uh ran as an independent for

19
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:52,719
congress in 2002 got 27% of the vote as

20
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:55,160
an independent on a $20,000 budget you

21
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:57,679
know so um I've running this time as an

22
00:00:55,159 --> 00:00:59,518
independent for governor of the state of

23
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:01,238
Kentucky and let me tell you I was

24
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:04,118
mighty impressed to hear these words

25
00:01:01,238 --> 00:01:08,879
from meline because she's got it exactly

26
00:01:04,118 --> 00:01:12,640
right marijuana is just a symptom of the

27
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:14,199
issue the real issue is are we still

28
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,159
Sovereign human

29
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:18,320
beings that's what the American

30
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:21,520
Revolution was all about marijuana is an

31
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:23,000
iconic issue because it shows just how

32
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:25,158
far the government has gone in

33
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,959
overstepping its bounds in policing

34
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:30,118
private behavior and impinging on the

35
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:32,559
whole idea of what America itself was

36
00:01:30,118 --> 00:01:35,118
all about you know before America we

37
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,640
were all property we belonged to the

38
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:38,200
king or the queen or the warlord or

39
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,319
whoever had the most gunpowder in the

40
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:43,640
valley and they said hey come in here

41
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:45,718
off with your head there you went there

42
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:47,920
was nothing there you had no rights you

43
00:01:45,718 --> 00:01:50,718
were property you belong to whoever had

44
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,478
the most gunpowder but when our founding

45
00:01:50,718 --> 00:01:54,280
fathers decided they're going to set

46
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:56,280
this country up and wrote the

47
00:01:54,280 --> 00:02:00,118
Declaration of Independence they

48
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:03,320
recognized in in essence that we we were

49
00:02:00,118 --> 00:02:07,078
all created by our creator and endowed

50
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:08,799
with inalienable human rights among them

51
00:02:07,078 --> 00:02:11,239
life liberty and pursuit of happiness

52
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,120
for the first time they gave each of us

53
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:14,640
our

54
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:17,480
sovereignty for there the first time any

55
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:19,919
ruling party had ever conceded that the

56
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:22,399
individual was a sovereign

57
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:25,000
thing and they wrote the Constitution to

58
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,560
try to to try to instill the the the

59
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,318
legal system to protect it and since

60
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:33,319
that time it has been in great peril by

61
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:35,359
people who seek to subvert it and make

62
00:02:33,318 --> 00:02:38,159
slaves of us to their

63
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,200
will and believe you me the man ain't

64
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:42,639
racist he doesn't care what color his

65
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:42,639
slaves

66
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:52,920
are and the whole idea of having piss in

67
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:55,280
the cup to hold a job in America is

68
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:58,119
athma to what America itself was built

69
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,120
on

70
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:04,120
yeah I've been that this I was 24 years

71
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:06,400
old and a Milkman in 1971 when I decided

72
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:09,039
I was Grist for the mill I was going to

73
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,640
end up in prison or dead at an early age

74
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:13,400
because I didn't understand the system

75
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:14,759
and if if I as long as I was ignorant of

76
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,640
the system I was going to be a pawn in

77
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:18,719
their game so I decided I had to learn a

78
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:21,479
system and the best way to do that was

79
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:22,919
to go to college become an attorney and

80
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:24,119
if I was going to do that put in all

81
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:25,559
that work I might as well become

82
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,360
governor of Kentucky and change

83
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,680
marijuana laws and try to live Kentucky

84
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,680
back into

85
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,680
prosperity

86
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:38,200
wo we were the world's largest producer

87
00:03:35,438 --> 00:03:40,878
of cannabis for over a hundred years we

88
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:42,119
called it hemp you know people said

89
00:03:40,878 --> 00:03:44,280
what's the difference Gatewood and I

90
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:46,000
said well you know hemp and marijuana

91
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,080
are both cannabis in the same way that

92
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,729
Danny DeVito and Dennis Rodman are both

93
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,030
adult

94
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:53,238
[Applause]

95
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:55,519
[Laughter]

96
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:57,878
males you

97
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,480
know yeah but the Kentucky was world's

98
00:03:57,878 --> 00:04:01,719
largest producer so we ought to return

99
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:03,679
to to it and let our Farmers back into

100
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:05,919
the niche of producing energy to solve

101
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,840
our energy problems instead of giving

102
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:10,798
all this marijuana giving all this money

103
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:12,438
over to to the oil producing countries

104
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,159
you know we calculated that if you could

105
00:04:12,438 --> 00:04:16,680
plant 7% of the US agricultural land in

106
00:04:15,158 --> 00:04:17,839
hemp you wouldn't have to import another

107
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,239
drop of

108
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:22,758
oil but you know what what's happened is

109
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:24,478
a great a great synthetic subversion

110
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:27,160
where those people who make synthetic

111
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:29,879
products have used the criminal law to

112
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:32,000
to criminalize Farmers from producing uh

113
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:33,719
competitive natural products in both

114
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,879
Petr chemicals and

115
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,800
pharmaceuticals and a great deal of our

116
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:40,079
problems today could be directly

117
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,680
Associated to the people I refer to as

118
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:43,439
the Petr chemical pharmaceutical

119
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:47,038
military industrial transnational

120
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:47,038
corporate fascist Elite son of a

121
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,800
[ __ ] who have never said a pledge of

122
00:04:51,478 --> 00:04:54,519
allegiance to the flag of the United

123
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,560
States of America or to the Republic for

124
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:58,359
which it stands they're not warm and

125
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,038
fuzzy about us or our children or

126
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,560
grandchildren and and they see the

127
00:05:00,038 --> 00:05:03,360
Constitution and the Bill of Rights as

128
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:05,360
impediments to the implementation of a

129
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,520
new world order in the global

130
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,199
economy and that's just where it's at

131
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:11,319
they you know they want to flatten the

132
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:15,038
world to make us all you know a global

133
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:17,800
economy and to you erase National

134
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:19,560
boundaries uh but you know they can't

135
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:21,079
afford to give every other human being

136
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,959
on Earth the same constitutional

137
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:25,240
Privileges and rights that we enjoy and

138
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:26,719
recognition of sovereign human beings so

139
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:29,639
they're going to have to take ours away

140
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:32,410
from us in order to make us a flat Earth

141
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:32,800
I ain't going down without a fight

142
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:34,639
[Applause]

143
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:38,520
[Music]

144
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:41,280
yeah so in 1983 like I said I started my

145
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:43,719
political campaign I got up I started

146
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:46,359
getting up every day in 1971 so I've

147
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:48,000
been at it 40 years and I've run for

148
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:51,160
governor several times so I I have a

149
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,680
pretty good idea about what politics is

150
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:55,319
all about I gave the the reform the

151
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,400
keynote address at the Reform Party

152
00:05:55,319 --> 00:06:00,039
National Convention back in 2000 and uh

153
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:02,599
you know so i' I've been there I've

154
00:06:00,038 --> 00:06:04,120
observed the politics and after 40 years

155
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:06,520
I'd have to be pretty dumb not to have

156
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:09,840
come up with at least one good idea in

157
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:11,240
those 40 years and I I do tell the folks

158
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:12,719
in this race right here if I was ever

159
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:16,560
going to lie to you I would already have

160
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,560
been elected but you

161
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:22,598
know but but but descriptively speaking

162
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:26,080
uh descriptively speaking Kentucky

163
00:06:22,598 --> 00:06:26,079
suffers from electile

164
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:31,120
dysfunction what's happening is that the

165
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:32,840
the both parties have their horns locked

166
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,639
up like two bull elk fighting over

167
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:37,159
territory while the business of the

168

party can produce a candidate could

170
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:41,800
disengage from the partisanship long

171
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:44,360

like we are one in the state of

203
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:02,199

off of a my website at Gatewood dcom but

215
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:37,079
we have a hell of a chance of winning in

216
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,718
November our primaries are this coming

217
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,560

218
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:43,440
totally

219
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:46,239
independent and what interest you may

220
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:49,320
have in what how I do out there in that

221
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:51,519
race is that we're going to take a giant

222
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:55,320
leap we're going to take a giant leap

223
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:57,159
we're going to go all the way to find

224
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:00,360
out whether America still has a pulse or

225
00:08:57,159 --> 00:09:02,600
not and we're going to do it

226
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:04,480
constitutionally the United States

227
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,040
Constitution does not provide you the

228
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,839
right to life liberty and the pursuit to

229
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:10,039
happiness that's in Independence

230
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:13,200
Declaration of Independence that's not

231
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:15,000
law so you don't officially have a right

232
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:18,120
to that under federal

233
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,720
law but Kentucky has a constitution also

234
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:22,720
just like all the other states do but it

235
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:26,240
just so happens that ky's Constitution

236
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:29,600
is the most Pro people Constitution ever

237
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:31,360
written that I people back in 189 he got

238
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,079
so tired of being raped by the railroad

239
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,600
companies that they wrote a constitution

240
00:09:33,078 --> 00:09:37,439
that protected the people and kept

241
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,560
corporations from being running rough

242
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,800
shot over

243
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:43,078
everybody and even now that's beginning

244
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:46,479
to fracture as our legislature keeps

245
00:09:43,078 --> 00:09:47,838
selling out to to the uh to the uh folks

246
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,399
that I call the petrochemical

247
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:51,200
pharmaceutical military industrial

248
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:53,639
transnational corporate fascist Elite

249
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,640
son of a

250
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:05,120
[ __ ] so uh what's going to happen is

251
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:08,760
that the very first section of ky's

252
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:10,799
constitution ensures that it citizens

253
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:13,838
constitutionally are

254
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:16,399
endowed with the right to life liberty

255
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:18,160
and pursuit to happiness that's the

256
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:20,480
number one section in Kentucky

257
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:23,600
Constitution so I feel obliged to make

258
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:25,399
it the number one basis of policy for my

259
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,278
relationship of government to the people

260
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:30,159
in state of Kentucky I'm going to get it

261
00:10:28,278 --> 00:10:31,720
off of their B

262
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:33,399
I'm going to take it out of the bedrooms

263
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:35,200

264
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:36,839
the bladders the billfolds and back

265
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,320
pockets the internet bulletin boards and

266
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:39,720
put them back in the little box where

267
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,800
they

268
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:45,800
belong I'm going to make government not

269
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:48,039
a burden on the people I think it's the

270
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:50,240
role of government to uplift Enlighten

271
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:52,719
educate and endow

272
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,519
