1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,068
this is my first time ever at Hope says

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:07,290
so really excited to be here thank you

3
00:00:05,068 --> 00:00:08,759
so much for coming out to us cinema I

4
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:12,120
feel honored to be up here to tell my

5
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:13,769
story it is really surreal to be up here

6
00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:15,239
I know it's a little cliche but if you

7
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:17,670
would have told me like a year ago or

8
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,550
even a couple months ago that I'd be up

9
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:23,640
here on this stage today talking all you

10
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:25,560
about marijuana I probably would have

11
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,910
believed you and that's because I've

12
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:30,479
only been talking about it for about

13
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:34,469
three weeks up until then I was a local

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:36,270
news anchor in eugene oregon and i know

15
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:38,250
that was the job i dreamed of having i

16
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:40,109
went to college for it but it was

17
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:43,460
abruptly cut short when i was forced to

18
00:00:40,109 --> 00:00:45,689
take a drug test and I failed due to THC

19
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:47,460
most of you probably agree that these

20
00:00:45,689 --> 00:00:51,299
sort of drug testing policies in the

21
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:53,219
workplace are ridiculous but

22
00:00:51,299 --> 00:00:54,899
unfortunately even in Oregon and in

23
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:56,820
Washington in other states where it's

24
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:59,340
been legalized it's still perfectly

25
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:01,619
legal to have these sort of drug testing

26
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:03,570
policies it's a complete double standard

27
00:01:01,619 --> 00:01:06,989
and we just need to keep talking about

28
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:09,000
it the fact is no one wants an unsafe

29
00:01:06,989 --> 00:01:10,798
work environment we can all agree on

30
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,519
that but if people are allowed to use

31
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:17,009
alcohol or pharmaceuticals or tobacco or

32
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:18,840
what have you in their free time then

33
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:20,640
they should be able to use marijuana in

34
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,159
their free time because it's a safer

35
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,159
alternative

36
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:28,159
the fact is I was fight I was fired for

37
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:29,810
having an active THC in my system even

38
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,609
though I was one-hundred-percent sober

39
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:34,009
at work every day that i recorded to

40
00:01:31,608 --> 00:01:36,589
work if i would have stuck to you know

41
00:01:34,009 --> 00:01:38,899
the encourage devices of drinking or

42
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:42,950
using pharmaceuticals i would still have

43
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:44,810
my job today as a local news anchor you

44
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:46,189
and I probably see that ridiculous

45
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:49,250
double standard but a lot of people

46
00:01:46,188 --> 00:01:51,348
don't understand that still and it's I

47
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:53,840
think our responsibility to point it out

48
00:01:51,349 --> 00:01:56,090
so that people do understand that's the

49
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,489
only way we're going to ever see more

50
00:01:56,090 --> 00:02:00,140
changes to policies and laws we're doing

51
00:01:58,489 --> 00:02:04,520
a great job right now but there is still

52
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:06,379
a long way to go obviously when you're

53
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:08,030
familiar with cannabis and you know it's

54
00:02:06,379 --> 00:02:10,579
a Saxon you keep thinking you're exposed

55
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:12,348
to it I think that it's kind of hard to

56
00:02:10,579 --> 00:02:14,329
even understand how people can be so

57
00:02:12,348 --> 00:02:16,098
against it or you know even understand

58
00:02:14,329 --> 00:02:18,099
why we're having this argument but I

59
00:02:16,098 --> 00:02:21,738
think they all comes back to a lack of

60
00:02:18,098 --> 00:02:24,259
exposure if we just expose people to the

61
00:02:21,739 --> 00:02:25,670
truth more about canvas then I think a

62
00:02:24,259 --> 00:02:27,649
lot more people would understand and

63
00:02:25,669 --> 00:02:29,568
support it I don't know maybe some of

64
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:32,030
you have even changed your views on

65
00:02:29,568 --> 00:02:34,909
marijuana over the years I know I was at

66
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:36,919
Derek kid I you know was ten years old

67
00:02:34,909 --> 00:02:39,859
being told all these facts about

68
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:41,298
marijuana that I just took at perfect

69
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:43,370
because I didn't know any better and I

70
00:02:41,299 --> 00:02:45,680
was so young but then as I got older and

71
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:48,200
as I show exposed to marijuana and

72
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,329
exposed to people who use cannabis I

73
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:52,608
realized that it wasn't as scary as

74
00:02:50,329 --> 00:02:55,129
everyone made it out to be but it took

75
00:02:52,609 --> 00:02:56,299
that exposure and I really truly believe

76
00:02:55,129 --> 00:02:58,039
there are a lot of people out there

77
00:02:56,299 --> 00:03:00,560
they're just like me that if they were

78
00:02:58,039 --> 00:03:01,939
exposed to it and they knew the truth

79
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,750
there'd be no way that they could

80
00:03:01,939 --> 00:03:07,460
possibly be against it

81
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:09,229
you can be part of the change if you

82
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:11,540
just talk to your friend in this family

83
00:03:09,229 --> 00:03:13,549
here if you haven't already about your

84
00:03:11,539 --> 00:03:16,099
cannabis use actually just tell them

85
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:19,010
that using marijuana doesn't make you a

86
00:03:16,099 --> 00:03:21,289
bad person and that seems like kind of a

87
00:03:19,009 --> 00:03:22,819
fact that we all understand here but a

88
00:03:21,289 --> 00:03:24,620
lot of people out there don't there's

89
00:03:22,819 --> 00:03:27,530
still all these misconceptions that just

90
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:29,569
using this plant makes you a bad person

91
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:31,310
we need to keep talking about it and we

92
00:03:29,569 --> 00:03:32,659
need to put an end to it if you're

93
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:34,819
thinking about coming out of the

94
00:03:32,659 --> 00:03:36,199
cannabis closet I've learned a few

95
00:03:34,819 --> 00:03:39,319
things so far and i just want to show

96
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:41,839
them with you number one I like I said

97
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:44,239
it's only been about three weeks and the

98
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,580
response has been overwhelmingly

99
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:49,909
positive almost everyone who's reached

100
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:52,610
out to me individually has not only you

101
00:03:49,909 --> 00:03:53,959
know been so supportive but they thanked

102
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:55,610
me for talking about this because

103
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:57,229
there's so many people out there that

104
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:59,420
will still lose their family lose their

105
00:03:57,229 --> 00:04:01,969
jobs maybe even go to jail faith and

106
00:03:59,419 --> 00:04:04,339
talk about this so I think that you know

107
00:04:01,969 --> 00:04:05,959
here in a state where legal if you can

108
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:07,430
talk about it please do because the

109
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:09,950
overwhelming support shows we have

110
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:13,219
strength in numbers but just need to

111
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:15,039
keep talking about it number two the

112
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:17,779
haters are still going to hate

113
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:20,750
unfortunately but it's not necessarily a

114
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:22,219
bad thing because fortunately all the

115
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:25,250
ignorant 0 comments have been

116
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:28,010
outnumbered by a ratio of about 15 to 1

117
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:30,529
and even though they're talking about it

118
00:04:28,009 --> 00:04:31,819
and negatively they're still talking

119
00:04:30,529 --> 00:04:35,149
about it and that leads me to number

120
00:04:31,819 --> 00:04:36,889
three even though the skaters have

121
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:40,279
spoken up coming out of the cannabis

122
00:04:36,889 --> 00:04:42,469
closet is totally worth it because even

123
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:45,289
when they're using their ignorant

124
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:47,090
remarks it's in the end the story is

125
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:49,610
getting everyone to talk about the facts

126
00:04:47,089 --> 00:04:52,849
and if you know the facts about cannabis

127
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:54,800
the facts are in our favor therefore I

128
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:57,639
believe because of the facts

129
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,810
the social acceptance of cannabis use is

130
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:01,788
inevitable it's going to happen it's

131
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:04,610
just a matter of how fast it happens and

132
00:05:01,788 --> 00:05:07,098
the only way it gotta happen is if we

133
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:09,800
keep talking about it so take it from me

134
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:13,069
a former local news anchor now marijuana

135
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:16,689
activist you will not regret it so just

136
00:05:13,069 --> 00:05:16,689
keep talking about it thank you so much
