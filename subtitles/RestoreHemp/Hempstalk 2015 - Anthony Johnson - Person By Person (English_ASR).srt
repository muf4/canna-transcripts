3
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:11,099
appreciate the warm welcome and

4
00:00:09,029 --> 00:00:13,678
introduction I am just happy to have

5
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:18,179
played my part to help legalize and

6
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:21,060
regulate marijuana here in Oregon but

7
00:00:18,179 --> 00:00:23,460
let's give it up for T'Pol Stanford one

8
00:00:21,059 --> 00:00:26,759
of the Giants of the movement and I'd

9
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:29,039
like to say that all the activists who

10
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:31,349
are working today we all stand on the

11
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,210
shoulders of giants and Paul Stanford is

12
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:37,530
one of those giants so really appreciate

13
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:41,189
all the work he's had to do and you know

14
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:43,289
I got involved in activism because I saw

15
00:00:41,189 --> 00:00:45,539
my african-american friends treated more

16
00:00:43,289 --> 00:00:47,780
harshly than my white friends for

17
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:49,558
marijuana offenses back in Missouri and

18
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:51,090
the first time we got a

19
00:00:49,558 --> 00:00:53,429
decriminalization measure on the ballot

20
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:55,230
because we couldn't stand to see young

21
00:00:53,429 --> 00:00:57,329
students have their lives ruined for

22
00:00:55,229 --> 00:00:59,939
marijuana within the city limits to come

23
00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:01,829
in Missouri we lost we only got forty

24
00:00:59,939 --> 00:01:03,780
three percent of the vote but then we

25
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:05,159
got right back on the ballot again and

26
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,950
we got more than sixty percent of the

27
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:09,299
vote the next time we made the ballot

28
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:10,939
decriminalizing marijuana in the city

29
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:14,040
limits of Columbia Missouri and

30
00:01:10,938 --> 00:01:15,809
legalizing medicinal use for any patient

31
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,900
so the patient finds themselves in

32
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:21,240
Columbia Missouri they can possess at

33
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:24,420
the 35 grams a medicinal cannabis

34
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:27,149
legally and now that movement in

35
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:29,759
Missouri is looking as moot as moved on

36
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:32,040
to decriminalize marijuana and st. louis

37
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:36,329
dee chrome eyes marijuana kansas city is

38
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:38,460
now looking to pass a statewide medical

39
00:01:36,328 --> 00:01:42,508
marijuana legalization measure in 2016

40
00:01:38,459 --> 00:01:45,658
and I think this movement of just step

41
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:47,879
by step person by person city by city

42
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:50,759
state by state is how we're going to

43
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:54,599
legalize marijuana fully you know here

44
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:56,250
in Oregon we had to decriminalize

45
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:58,798
marijuana all the way back in nineteen

46
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:01,140
seventy three the very first state to

47
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,960
decriminalize marijuana and then we have

48
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:06,420
to wait until nineteen ninety-eight to

49
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:08,758
legalize medicinal cannabis and then in

50
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:10,939
2004 we tried to legalize medical

51
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:13,459
marijuana dispensaries it didn't pass

52
00:02:10,939 --> 00:02:15,979
I 2010 we try to legalize medical

53
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:18,770
marijuana dispensaries again it didn't

54
00:02:15,979 --> 00:02:21,319
pass and then the legislature legalized

55
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:25,310
medical marijuana dispensaries in 2013

56
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:27,469
you know then 2012 Paul and measure ad

57
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:29,330
campaign team got a legalization measure

58
00:02:27,469 --> 00:02:32,319
on the ballot that would have legalized

59
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:34,730
you know possession for adults

60
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,979
cultivation for adults it got forty

61
00:02:34,729 --> 00:02:38,750
seven percent of the vote you know and

62
00:02:36,979 --> 00:02:41,569
it didn't pass but it laid the

63
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:44,810
foundation for measure 91 each step of

64
00:02:41,569 --> 00:02:47,479
the way we get closer and closer to true

65
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:50,120
equality and true freedom and then after

66
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:51,739
we pass measure 91 we say we're not done

67
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,599
there you know we're going to further

68
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:55,670
decriminalize marijuana we're going to

69
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:57,189
further reduce marijuana penalties and

70
00:02:55,669 --> 00:02:59,659
we passed the first in the nation

71
00:02:57,189 --> 00:03:02,900
expungement provision that can help up

72
00:02:59,659 --> 00:03:07,490
to 78,000 people get marijuana offenses

73
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:09,189
off their record when down we've

74
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:12,320
accomplished that we're still not done

75
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:15,109
you know we got to equality for

76
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:18,979
employment true equality for housing

77
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:21,650
education to have adult smoking sections

78
00:03:18,979 --> 00:03:25,819
and a festival where they celebrate

79
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:28,730
alcohol numerous times a year and we're

80
00:03:25,819 --> 00:03:31,340
going to do that not because of me not

81
00:03:28,729 --> 00:03:33,590
because of Paul not because of any other

82
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:36,189
activists you may hear about we do that

83
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:39,500
because of people like you all right

84
00:03:36,189 --> 00:03:41,359
step-by-step person by person you share

85
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:43,610
your stories about marijuana how

86
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,890
marijuana helped you medicinally how it

87
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:48,170
helps you relax how it's a better choice

88
00:03:45,889 --> 00:03:50,329
for you than alcohol or how it works

89

92
00:03:54,769 --> 00:03:58,370
