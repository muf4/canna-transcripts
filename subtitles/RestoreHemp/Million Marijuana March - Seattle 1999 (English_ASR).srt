1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:05,278
hello and welcome to the seattle million

2
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:08,160
marijuana march which is put on by the

3
00:00:05,278 --> 00:00:10,800
folks with the seattle hemp fest we're

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,519
here to document

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:16,240
the march which leaves from seattle's

6
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:19,118
volunteer park and heads over to west

7
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:22,320
lake park over in downtown seattle looks

8
00:00:19,118 --> 00:00:25,118
like a crowd of about 300 people here at

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,920
the start of the march

10
00:00:25,118 --> 00:00:29,518
maybe a little more it's growing so

11
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,800
that's a good thing

12
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:36,759
and so we're about four minutes away

13
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:36,759
from the start of the march

14
00:01:26,478 --> 00:01:31,200
now that the truth is out

15
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:32,319
even the politicians have figured this

16
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,400
thing out

17
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:38,639
you can go hit it in their own prayers

18
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,640
might help you loosen your eye and

19
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:39,719
all the legalize

20
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:48,599
wake up

21
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:21,238
because it's just a matter of life

22
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,319
but you cannot win the fight

23
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,360
hey mr politicians

24
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,319
there is a piece

25
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,040
we

26
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:29,279
it's a dream so believe

27
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:44,239
how we've done it so we

28
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:46,799
don't have to do

29
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:52,918
it again

30
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:52,918
so we don't have to do it again

31
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,560
america

32
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,360
it's a dream so believe

33
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:22,960
america

34
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:25,199
there was a peace resolution and a

35
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:30,560
peaceful revolution

36
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:33,840
and a peaceful solution to save america

37
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:36,839
and the peaceful

38
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:36,839
america

39
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,918
these videos

40
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,240
we are here today as part of a global

41
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,800
voice that is screaming we will not be

42
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,879
persecuted we will not be scapegoated we

43
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,280
will not be demonized or imprisoned any

44
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:22,639
longer this is a civil rights movement

45
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:22,638
and it's sweeping the world

46
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:32,079
as adults in a free society we demand

47
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,519
the right to make our own educated and

48
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:35,680
informed choices

49
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:37,519
on what we use for medicine

50
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,120
in industry

51
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:41,839
for spiritual purposes and for

52
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,598
recreation as adults

53
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:45,918
to our government we are saying we do

54
00:07:43,598 --> 00:07:47,839
not need you in our living rooms thank

55
00:07:45,918 --> 00:07:50,159
you

56
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:52,079
we do not need you in our bedrooms we do

57
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,759
not need you in our grow rooms and we

58
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:57,560
don't need you in our goddamn blood

59
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,560
streams that's for sure

60
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:04,159
we're saying

61
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:07,360
no more orphans no more clear cuts no

62
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:09,919
more ocean of tears no more pot war we

63
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:12,919
demand cannabis amnesty now for all

64
00:08:09,918 --> 00:08:12,918
prisoners

65
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:21,120
these

66
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,520
we're living in some wild times man

67
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:26,000
nobody has ever lived in a time like

68
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:28,318
this in the history of humanity things

69
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,160
are changing fast

70
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,240
these are times of major transmission

71
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,918
for human behavior this change is

72
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,879
manifesting in so many ways that it

73
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:38,559
would be difficult to compute them all

74
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:40,399
one can only guess what the result of

75
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:42,718
this gradual metamorphosis will be but

76
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,240
there's one thing that is certain to any

77
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,120
discerning person

78
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,200
uh

79
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,679
and that is

80
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,519
as a people to have any kind of positive

81
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:53,120
impact or effect on creating a desirable

82
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:55,600
future for the generations that surely

83
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,679
will come show their global calamity we

84
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,959
got to come together right now

85
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:01,199
the people who will have the most

86
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:03,518
successful impact on the world will be

87
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,360
those who follow principles and ideals

88
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:07,839
based on values that are morally and

89
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,839
ethically right that are sound and

90
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:12,080
self-evident

91
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,600
policies of governments which condone

92
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,440
acts that are unlawful to the

93
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,839
sovereignty and autonomy of the

94
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:20,399
individual as a human being should not

95
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:23,839
be considered acceptable or tolerable by

96
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,839
the citizens of those governments

97
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,278
these include

98
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:32,000
these include policies that strip rights

99
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:33,919
of free speech choice of religion racial

100
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,600
and sexual equality and other rights

101
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:38,479
that do not interfere with or prevent

102
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,480
the rights of others

103
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:46,719
america has declared war on drugs

104
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:49,120
america's war is humanely unlawful it's

105
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,560
unacceptable unacceptable human rights

106
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,720
violations across the board have

107
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:55,919
resulted from the criminalization of

108
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:58,720
otherwise decent law-abiding citizens

109
00:09:55,919 --> 00:10:00,559
merely for possessing using or selling

110
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,519
only those drugs which the established

111
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:05,278
status quo hasn't had the opportunity to

112
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:08,399
cultivate some sort of financial

113
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:08,399
monopoly on yet

114
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,279
but there's a lot of money to be made

115
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:17,120
from the war on drugs

116
00:10:15,278 --> 00:10:19,360
war on drugs you know it's not even

117
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,200
possible you can't do that you can only

118
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,360
wage a war on people

119
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,680
so the concept is logically flawed by

120
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,000
design

121
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:29,759
we stand here on the 50th anniversary of

122
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,679
the universal declaration of human

123
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:33,039
rights but we have more people in jail

124
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:36,319
in the united states than any other

125
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:36,319
country in the free world

126
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,519
the vast majority of them are in for

127
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:44,000
victimless non-violent crimes many time

128
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:46,480
of them many of them are first offenders

129
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,639
previous to today the very proclamation

130
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,639
of a drug war was absurd

131
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:53,439
to have a war there must be two opposing

132
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:55,039
sides both taking some casualties it

133
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:59,160
would be more accurate to call the

134
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:59,159
previous years a drug massacre

135
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:06,320
by demonizing by criminalization people

136
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,879
who choose to recreationally use or sell

137
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,480
or buy or manufacture substances not

138
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:13,120
approved by the government we cannot

139
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:15,600
defend ourselves ourselves unless we

140
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,839
risk arrest and incarceration the loss

141
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,839
of our job in our home nobody has

142
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,920
statistics on responsible recreational

143
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,839
users of substances because those people

144
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:26,000
aren't creating any recordable problem

145
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:28,079
their lives are in society

146
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,519
the emergency room does not receive the

147
00:11:28,078 --> 00:11:31,679
folks while they're casually kicking

148
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:34,159
back on their sofa driving the remote

149
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:34,159
control

150
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:42,000
my admittedly radical leftist claim of

151
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:44,000
cultural genocide of sorts i believe is

152
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,799
qualified by the gross discrimination

153
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,958
against and deliberate

154
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:50,879
i'll try it's a long speech i'll try to

155
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:53,199
slow down deliberate scapegoating of

156
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:55,919
people who use illicit drugs even

157
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:58,720
marijuana unarguably the mildest drug of

158
00:11:55,919 --> 00:12:01,838
all and by most definitions an herb not

159
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,839
a drug an herb

160
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:12,879
one marijuana felony one marijuana

161
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,879
felony like throwing 100 plants or more

162
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:16,559
will result in the loss of all welfare

163
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:19,039
and other public aid

164
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:20,159
student loans and pell grants public

165
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:22,078
housing

166
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:24,000
gi bill

167
00:12:22,078 --> 00:12:25,599
also the forfeit laws they're not

168
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,600
forfeit laws they're seizure laws

169
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,480
scorpion means you voluntarily gave it

170
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,920
up

171
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:33,039
they're taking it

172
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:35,278
house car bank account computers they'll

173
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:38,319
wipe you out man they can result from

00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:40,078
one felony marijuana arrest mandatory

175
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,040
minimum sentencing guidelines prevent

176
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:43,599
judges

177
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:46,399
from stopping 20 to 30 year sentences

178
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,159
for marijuana offenses with no parole

179
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:51,120
possible

180
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:52,879
rapists pedophiles murderers for some

181
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,600
reason their crimes are not worthy of

182
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:58,240
such punishment and in most cases they

183
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:00,480
get much less sentences according to our

184
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,480
law

185
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:08,320
the drug massacre is over

186
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:11,200
now with the vast network of very

187
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:13,519
sophisticated and dedicated activists

188
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,680
many of them family members of prisoners

189
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:18,320
or ex-prisoners themselves there's a

190
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:21,359
formidable foe to the phony unwinnable

191
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:23,360
catchphrase war on drugs

192
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,919
there is a worldwide movement of

193
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:28,959
opposition based on humanitarian ethics

194
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:31,838
and common sense facing compassion and

195
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:34,638
seeking an all-out total war as we are

196
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:38,760
on addiction poverty and abuse

197
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,759
that's what we need to fight
