saw many people and it was awesome it

9
00:00:21,329 --> 00:00:25,500
was seattle we had a little bit of

10
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:28,230
weather and no one cared because we are

11
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:31,379
freedom fighters and we don't care what

12
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:34,289
we care about is what we smoke and we

13
00:00:31,379 --> 00:00:36,869
care about our freedom at these rallies

14
00:00:34,289 --> 00:00:39,149
and that's what we do as I mentioned my

15
00:00:36,869 --> 00:00:42,179
name is Earth thrasher i'm also scott

16
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:43,799
gordon and there's so much going on the

17
00:00:42,179 --> 00:00:46,558
community i just love being a part of

18
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:49,828
this community i'm from oregon and we

19
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:52,378
just recently legalized in november and

20
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:54,448
it was freaking awesome and part of it

21
00:00:52,378 --> 00:00:57,238
was because of you watch the tone ians

22
00:00:54,448 --> 00:01:01,890
we're teammates you know we watched you

23
00:00:57,238 --> 00:01:03,628
guys in 2012 legalized and we choked and

24
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:06,000
then all of a sudden we came back watch

25
00:01:03,628 --> 00:01:08,489
you guys our legislators learn we can't

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,950
buy your weed and all of a sudden we

27
00:01:08,489 --> 00:01:14,459
came back we didn't quit and now we're

28
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:16,950
legalized the only problem I'm seeing

29
00:01:14,459 --> 00:01:21,089
right now is that we're proud of mash 91

30
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:23,430
and you guys are proud of i-502 we need

31
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:25,740
to turn that around so hopefully you

32
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:28,409
guys will come into organ by so far we'd

33
00:01:25,739 --> 00:01:31,259
continue to by washingtonian weed and

34
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:33,210
keep educating your legislators we had a

35
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:35,879
great medical program through the years

36
00:01:33,209 --> 00:01:39,149
and we kept teaching these guys and they

37
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:41,609
saw they knew they understood weed they

38
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:44,310
understood what it meant so now we're in

39
00:01:41,609 --> 00:01:46,618
our next phase which is equality you

40
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:49,890
know when we legalized and now it's time

41
00:01:46,618 --> 00:01:54,239
to equalize and part of that you know is

42
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:56,280
getting a job without pissing you guys

43
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:58,560
like pissing in a cup just to get a job

44
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,810
just to get a paycheck just to support

45
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,600
your family do whatever you want to do

46
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:05,240
you know there's a lot of job

47
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:07,579

48
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:11,560
