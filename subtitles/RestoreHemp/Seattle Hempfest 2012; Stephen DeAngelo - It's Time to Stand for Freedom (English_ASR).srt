1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,160
this is such an amazing event as I was

2
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:07,758
up here on the stage watching that

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:11,120
Divine cloud with smoke come over this

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:13,798
beautiful crowd you were all so

5
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:16,519
beautiful so beautiful in all of your

6
00:00:13,798 --> 00:00:18,480
diversity and all of your difference I

7
00:00:16,519 --> 00:00:22,079
look out on this crowd I see people of

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,080
every age and every

9
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:27,439
ethnicity I see people that come from

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:31,118
all over from every place from far and

11
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:34,640
wide and we're all United by our love

12
00:00:31,118 --> 00:00:37,960
for this plant and by our understanding

13
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:43,280
of one truth that the cannabis plant is

14
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:43,280
a good plan not an evil plan

15
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:48,239
[Music]

16
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:51,119
right you know I remember the last the

17
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:53,679
first first few hemp fests when there

18
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:56,679
were just hundreds of people here didn't

19
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:59,198
stay that way though did it grew to

20
00:00:56,679 --> 00:01:00,960
hundreds thousands tens of thousands of

21
00:00:59,198 --> 00:01:03,920
people

22
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,359
and now we have a movement that's

23
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:09,040
progressed and mirrored the growth of

24
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:11,719
this event in 17 States across the

25
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:14,439
country we have medical cannabis laws

26
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:17,719
and from the east coast to the West

27
00:01:14,438 --> 00:01:20,000
Coast from north to south from Michigan

28
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:20,879
to Colorado from New Jersey all the way

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,200
here to

30
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:26,679
Washington patients are now able to

31
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:28,320
access their medicine in safe

32
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:30,439
compassionate well-regulated

33
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:32,919
dispensaries and access

34
00:01:30,438 --> 00:01:35,839
points but that's not all that we've

35
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:38,599
done right we've also created tens of

36
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,880
thousands of well-paying jobs and

37
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:44,000
hundreds of millions of dollars of tax

38
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:46,560
revenue for our communities we've

39
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,879
reduced the burden on law enforcement

40
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,600
and we've made our neighborhoods

41
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:54,478
safer but the folks in the justice

42
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:56,959
department for some reason don't think

43
00:01:54,478 --> 00:02:00,158
that those are good things oh yeah so

44
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:02,839
last year they launched an attack on our

45
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:05,680
community that attack started out in

46
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:08,520
Michigan and Montana and when we didn't

47
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:11,680
notice when we didn't respond when there

48
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:14,719
was no outcry they expanded it to

49
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:18,360
California and now they've closed over

50
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:20,840
400 over 400 dispensaries access points

51
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:22,000
have been closed in California in the

52
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,479
past

53
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,519
year just last week Harborside Health

54
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:30,679
Center received notices that the

55
00:02:28,519 --> 00:02:32,200
government intends to seiz the property

56
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:34,400
that we're located in because we're

57
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:37,639
serving our

58
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:39,560
patients but we have no intention of

59
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:42,719
closing our

60
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:44,039
doors no way we're never ever going to

61
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:47,800
abandon our

62
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:51,719
patience we have nothing to hide and we

63
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:53,719
have Justice on our side we look forward

64
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:55,400
we look forward to our day in court when

65
00:02:53,719 --> 00:02:56,840
we intend to teach the justice

66
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,480
department the federal government a

67
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:00,239
lesson that they are never going to

68
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:02,799
forget

69
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:05,000
you know unfortunately I have to tell

70
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:08,000
you that this cancer is now spread to

71
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,280
Washington and to Oregon just uh last

72
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,919
week four letters went out from us

73
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:14,840
attorneys in the eastern part of the

74
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:16,399
state threatening to seize properties

75
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:18,840
and a bunch more in

76
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,599
Oregon so they're trying to do the same

77
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,878
thing here that they did in California

78
00:03:20,598 --> 00:03:23,079
but we're not going to let them do that

79
00:03:21,878 --> 00:03:28,000
are

80
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:29,920
we no way no way instead of crushing us

81
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,520
they're going to rise us to righteous

82
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:31,869
Fury

83
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,560
[Music]

84
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:37,080
[Applause]

85
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:39,920
right so I'm happy to tell you that

86
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:42,439
we've had tremendous support pull in

87
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:44,438
from all quarters around the country

88
00:03:42,438 --> 00:03:46,479
after harbor side was served including a

89
00:03:44,438 --> 00:03:49,438
really great takeover of the Obama

90
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:51,759
headquarters here by activists in

91
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:53,959
Seattle so thank you Seattle for turning

92
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:56,959
out and supporting us there at the Obama

93
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:59,158
office right we're all pulling together

94
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:02,039
with a common message to send to the

95
00:03:59,158 --> 00:04:04,120
president that it's time it's time for

96
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:06,639
him to keep the promise that he made to

97
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:09,120
us it's time for him to call off these

98
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:12,679
Rogue prosecutors it's time for them to

99
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:15,519
end their horrible campaign because why

100
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:18,840
because we're not going anywhere

101
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:21,280
right no way we've come too far and

102
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:24,478
we've worked too hard and we've made too

103
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:28,319
much progress to turn back now

104
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:31,319
right we are going to continue this

105
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:34,079
battle until we win it we came out of

106
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:36,759
the shadows and into the light 16 years

107
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:40,038
ago and we're never going back to that

108
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:42,439
place of Shadows again are we I know

109
00:04:40,038 --> 00:04:45,319
we've come out of the shadows and into

110
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:48,160
the light and that's where we're staying

111
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:48,159
thank you
