22
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:06,280
things that I learned when I came to

23
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:09,679
office Seattle gets it Seattle

24
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:11,759
understands Seattle is very smart and

25
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,040
yet we couldn't explain why when I took

26
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:16,879
office of the marijuana possession

27
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:21,680
charges that were in the hopper ready to

28
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:23,118
go why were 59% nearly 60% of them

29
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,200
against

30
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:28,799
African-Americans this city has a

31
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:31,320
population 8% African-American and 59%

32
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,280
of our marijuana possession arrest when

33
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:36,279
I took office January 1

34
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,719
2010 were against

35
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:41,359
African-Americans we know that the War

36
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:45,359
on Drugs is a

37
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:47,599
failure and we know that Seattle voters

38
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:49,759
recognize this and want to make a

39
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:52,239
difference and hefest is where we're

40
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:54,438
getting the message out so thank you all

41
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:58,239

43
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:02,839
signatures are being gathered for new

44
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,280
initiatives there's at least two going

45
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:07,118
now one that I'm

46
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:12,159
sponsoring

47
00:02:07,118 --> 00:02:13,840
502 is to legalize regulate and tax for

48
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:17,318
adult recreational

49
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,920
use it it deals with all of the issues

50
00:02:17,318 --> 00:02:21,759
that we're all confronting

51
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:24,878
here but in my office we're working

52
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:27,039
every day we're not going to prosecute

53
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:28,598
simple possession and we're going to

54
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:31,079
work to make sure that until it's

55
00:02:28,598 --> 00:02:33,359
legalized for everyone

56
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:36,319
that we found a way for sick people to

57
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,319
get the medicine they

58
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:44,000
need there's good in the neighborhood

59
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:47,878
we've worked we've worked really hard

60
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:51,280
and the good news is guys A legislature

61
00:02:47,878 --> 00:02:54,199
this year with Republicans and Democrats

62
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:58,120
passed a comprehensive medical marijuana

63
00:02:54,199 --> 00:03:00,959
bill we almost got there the governor

64
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:03,759
made a mistake vetoed a lot of it

65
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,319
but don't let that don't let that we're

66
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:08,759
going to be back in the legislature

67
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:11,399
again don't let that over overshadow the

68
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:14,120
fact that a bipartisan legislature

69
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,480
passed a great Bill to get medical

70
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:17,959
marijuana

71
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:21,119
out good in the neighborhood we're going

72
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:24,920
to work on all fronts to make sure that

73
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:27,480
ultimately adult recreational use is

74
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:30,639
legal and we're going to do that by

75
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:33,199
making sure we we work together

76
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:35,079
that we marijuana reformers are going to

77
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:38,399

86
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,799
we're not Prosecuting these cases and

87
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:02,799
