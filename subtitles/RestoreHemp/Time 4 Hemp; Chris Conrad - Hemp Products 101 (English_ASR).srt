1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:03,638
what we've got here the first thing I

2
00:00:01,719 --> 00:00:06,520
should show you is this shirt this is

3
00:00:03,638 --> 00:00:09,919
made of uh hemp with a blend with cotton

4
00:00:06,519 --> 00:00:12,039
this is a 55% hemp 45% cotton it's

5
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:13,960
that's made of hemp 55% hemp correct it

6
00:00:12,039 --> 00:00:16,160
lasts longer it's 26% more water

7
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:18,240
absorbent it's more insulative uh and

8
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,879
it's much stronger than regular cotton

9
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:23,679
would be wow um in the foreground here

10
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:25,358
I've got three pieces of paper one of

11
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:27,079
them this is like a parchment style

12
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,519
paper here this is what your Declaration

13
00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:30,079
of Independence and Constitution were

14
00:00:28,518 --> 00:00:32,000
originally written on a paper similar to

15
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:33,640
quality of this this is a filtration

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,399
paper here tea bags things that you need

17
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:37,000
to have stay strong when it's wet

18
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:38,679
because hemp fiber is strong it doesn't

19
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
lose that when it's in water this in the

20
00:00:38,679 --> 00:00:43,479
middle is a looks like a newsprint type

21
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,119
of paper it's a pul type of paper and

22
00:00:43,479 --> 00:00:47,799
made of huh correct uh did they use this

23
00:00:46,119 --> 00:00:49,479
back in the early days you know like

24
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:51,159
around Constitution time or something

25
00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:52,679
yeah well they didn't use this this is a

26
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:55,159
p paper they use more like this the

27
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:59,238
fiber um paper that's and they wrote on

28
00:00:55,159 --> 00:01:01,198
it manuscript paper daily right now uh

29
00:00:59,238 --> 00:01:02,959
over here we have some seed this is used

30
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:04,158
as bird seed right now yeah get the

31
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,478
birds high right yeah it's called Happy

32
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,280
Bird actually birds sing better um

33
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:10,079
because when they use it we don't know

34
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,640
if it's there's very little THC in there

35
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:13,560
it seems to be because it moistens their

36
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,640
throat because it has a lot of oil in

37
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:18,320
fact it's 30% oil and right next to it

38
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:20,159
here we have some hair gel this is made

39
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:22,758
from hemp oil and it's also got some

40
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,479
herbs in it some of the herbal hemp in

41
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:25,920
it now moving forward a little further

42
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:28,000
we see some other products that are made

43
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,560
from the seed when the seed is crushed

44
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,280
it produces uh oils

45
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:36,280
and a uh high protein powder here which

46
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:37,599
is called CA cake this is more

47
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:39,799
nutritional than any other thing that we

48
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:41,438
know of accepting for soya and in terms

49
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:43,320
of digestibility it's more digestible

50
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:44,879
than soya so it actually uh when you

51
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:47,279
look at parts of the world like um

52
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:48,438
northern Africa and bagladesh in these

53
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,640
areas where there's a lot Mass

54
00:01:48,438 --> 00:01:52,398
starvation a lot of that is a result of

55
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,320
international laws that are preventing

56
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:55,879
them from growing hemp for use as a food

57
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:57,599
supply which it has been for thousands

58
00:01:55,879 --> 00:01:59,839
of years for these count yes exactly the

59
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:01,679
law is the single convention Treaty of

60
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,880
1961 by the United Nations and you

61
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,560
notice that the big periods of

62
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:07,920
starvation began in the mid-60s late 60s

63
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:10,118
and continue on to today within 10 years

64
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,840
of banning hemp starvation became part

65
00:02:10,118 --> 00:02:14,280
of the norm for these parts of the world

66
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,000
wow now these two pieces of oil uh I

67
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,519
mean samples of oil this is a raw oil

68
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,360
you see it's got a little brownish color

69
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:21,959
similar to the seed itself this on the

70
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:24,440
other hand has been distilled and so

71
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:26,039
it's cleaner looking um you can make

72
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:28,000
anything from machine oil to cooking oil

73
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:29,840
out of these wow these are all fibers

74
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,120
from the plant this is a rather Raw

75
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,200
fiber this is called a toe line both of

76
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:36,200
these are from Russian hemp Russian hemp

77
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:38,439
right now this string here and this rope

78
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:41,518
they're both from Hungarian hemp this

79
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:43,598
has been made into a bag here through a

80
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,200
macet process they've wrapped it up

81
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:48,079
here's a PO holder made out of it your

82
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:49,639
balls of twine this tea bag back in here

83
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,080
and it swings us right back down to the

84
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:53,839
plant from which all these products can

85
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,840
be made w
