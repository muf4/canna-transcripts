8
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:25,260
one gentleman down here in the center

9
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:27,090
picture dr. Phil Leveque now a lot of

10
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:29,130
people have done a lot of things for

11
00:00:27,089 --> 00:00:30,809
medical marijuana but very few have done

12
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:33,960
what dr. leveque has done for the state

13
00:00:30,809 --> 00:00:36,780
of Oregon and for the world the whole

14
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:39,628
the whole globe believe me because he

15
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:42,539
was not just a spokesman he was a doctor

16
00:00:39,628 --> 00:00:45,479
that believed in us he believed in

17
00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:49,700
patients rights he believed in ending

18
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:53,308
pain ending the ability or the

19
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:55,079
disability to reach what you need to get

20
00:00:53,308 --> 00:00:57,589
the wet the medicine that you really

21
00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:00,689
need and he saw from a young age that

22
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:05,308
cannabis was that medicine he was born

23
00:01:00,689 --> 00:01:08,250
in 1923 his dad was one of the great

24
00:01:05,308 --> 00:01:10,679
loggers of Oregon and when his sons were

25
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:13,319
were young he told dr. Leveque and his

26
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:16,290
brother don't go into logging it's all

27
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:21,599
over got to find a new industry so that

28
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:24,390
was in the 30s so he did he went to

29
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:27,569
college and he got his degree in

30
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:29,219
biochemistry he joined Patton's army

31
00:01:27,569 --> 00:01:32,039
thinking that he'd be able to help on

32
00:01:29,219 --> 00:01:34,679
some fantastic level because of his

33
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,719
chemistry degree but instead they said

34
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,820
hey dude you're missing a couple of

35
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:41,280
fingers on your right hand you can't be

36
00:01:38,819 --> 00:01:42,929
an officer so instead they made a joint

37
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,719
he joined the infantry and became a

38
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:49,618
scout and is one of the scouts that

39
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:52,319
actually lived from Patton's army he

40
00:01:49,618 --> 00:01:56,280
crossed the Rhine his stories go on

41
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:59,548
forever and in fact this is his book dog

42
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:01,349
face soldier dhokla vex own book is

43
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:04,500
being Reata dright now but there are a

44
00:02:01,349 --> 00:02:07,109
few copies that are available so he

45
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,788
wrote his memoirs of the war but when he

46
00:02:07,109 --> 00:02:11,759
came back from the war he went to work

47
00:02:08,788 --> 00:02:13,479
he was a doctor he got his degree the

48
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:15,039
people that he trained under new

49
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:17,169
about cannabis medicine because there

50
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:19,090
the old guys they've been using cannabis

51
00:02:17,169 --> 00:02:20,589
medicine forever they never even

52
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:23,920
questioned whether or not they should

53
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:28,209
use it and so they so he discovered that

54
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:30,189
and still he would say right now should

55
00:02:28,209 --> 00:02:33,209
he be here that there's a bottle of

56
00:02:30,189 --> 00:02:36,250
cannabis medicine somewhere in his barn

57
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:40,269
from back then because it worked so well

58
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:42,060
he decided to keep it so he was a born

59
00:02:40,269 --> 00:02:46,209
in the wool you know dyed-in-the-wool

60
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:50,620
cannabis Crusader from a young age he

61
00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:54,340
had a lifetime of incredible experiences

62
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:57,659
he taught in Africa he was the first

63
00:02:54,340 --> 00:03:02,079
manda to at first doctor to teach

64
00:02:57,659 --> 00:03:05,019
surgeons brain surgery in Sierra Leone

65
00:03:02,079 --> 00:03:08,439
in their brand new hospitals so he'd

66
00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:10,750
made a lot of really great that you know

67
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:12,310
dedicated moves for all of us but when

68
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:14,829
it came to cannabis he came back to

69
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:17,859
Oregon he's had a practice and he soon

70
00:03:14,829 --> 00:03:21,969
discovered where his real calling was

71
00:03:17,859 --> 00:03:24,129
and this is it he put his all into he

72
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:26,590
got together with Paul Stanford Paul

73
00:03:24,129 --> 00:03:29,889
Loney and a lot of other very important

74
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:31,930
folks and worked at the th CF clinic the

75
00:03:29,889 --> 00:03:34,930
very first clinic in the state of Oregon

76
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:37,329

77
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:39,340
thousand veterans were his clients of

78
00:03:37,329 --> 00:03:43,000

79
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:45,340
heart but all of us were he testified

80
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,340

toxicologist pharmacologist he had a PhD

82
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:52,299

toxicologists in the country with those

84
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:56,590
