1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,980
we made a lot of progress since last

2
00:00:02,428 --> 00:00:08,189
year's hip stock you know they didn't

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:10,650
want us to have it again here today but

4
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:12,719
we're here and we're going to comply

5
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:16,230
with whatever rules they make us comply

6
00:00:12,718 --> 00:00:19,019
with we're not going away we're going to

7
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:21,600
continue to push the envelope until we

8
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:24,268
can grow hemp without regard to its THC

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,449
content but with regard to the most

10
00:00:24,268 --> 00:00:29,669
productive seed varieties the varieties

11
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:32,640
make the most protein and oil the

12
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:35,160
varieties that make the most fiber we

13
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:39,989
shouldn't be judging scene and fiber

14
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:44,009
production by THC content I think that

15
00:00:39,988 --> 00:00:47,640
high THC cannabis makes 20 times more

16
00:00:44,009 --> 00:00:50,218
seeds than what i call dwarf him the low

17
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:54,239
less than three ten to one percent hemp

18
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:59,399
and that makes twice as much fiber so

19
00:00:54,238 --> 00:01:01,649
until we can restore him the battle is

20
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:04,109
not over and we'll keep pushing this

21
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:06,540
envelope we should be able to have an

22
00:01:04,109 --> 00:01:12,150
adult smoking area right here in the

23
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:14,310
park just like the alcohol events can

24
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:17,280
have their alcohol area here in the park

25
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:22,100
alcohol as we know is much more

26
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:25,290
dangerous than marijuana marijuana will

27
00:01:22,099 --> 00:01:28,890
decrease your lifespan for most people

28
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:32,759
you have less stress lots of powerful

29
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:36,079
antioxidants you live longer how could

30
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:38,688
they say something so beneficial is bad

31
00:01:36,078 --> 00:01:40,679
we have to educate them they've been

32
00:01:38,688 --> 00:01:43,408
missing for him to this huge

33
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:46,470
misinformation campaign we call reefer

34
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:50,118
madness after that crazy movie the

35
00:01:46,469 --> 00:01:56,310
federal government funded back in 1937

36
00:01:50,118 --> 00:01:59,340
so we're here until we remove the stigma

37
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:02,609
the fall stigma surrounding marijuana

38
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:07,200
and I want to thank you all for coming
