1
00:00:00,269 --> 00:00:06,140
we lost Dennis Peron this last year and

2
00:00:06,169 --> 00:00:15,029
he was a father of medical marijuana and

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:18,448
he was around with the Harvey Milk crowd

4
00:00:15,029 --> 00:00:23,850
and all that sort of stuff so I feel

5
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:26,250
safe and saying what I'm about to say my

6
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:30,179
name is Anthony Taylor and I'm here to

7
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:32,700
recruit you I need every patient on this

8
00:00:30,178 --> 00:00:34,589
square to come up and talk to me about

9
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,450
how they can come to the Commission and

10
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:38,340
talk to the Commission because this

11
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:40,410
Commission needs to hear from patients

12
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:42,300
they need to hear from patients at every

13
00:00:40,409 --> 00:00:44,279
meeting they have they need to hear from

14
00:00:42,299 --> 00:00:47,128
patients when they go on the listening

15
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:49,140
tour and most importantly you have to

16
00:00:47,128 --> 00:00:52,429
get all your friends and all your

17
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:56,009
girlfriend's to stick with the program

18
00:00:52,429 --> 00:00:57,929
we're down to 45,000 patients right now

19
00:00:56,009 --> 00:01:01,349
and that's unacceptable

20
00:00:57,929 --> 00:01:04,890
this is a fee based program if the fees

21
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:07,829
go away the program goes away so renew

22
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:10,079
your goddamn cards and get your growers

23
00:01:07,829 --> 00:01:12,030
to stick with pace growing for patients

24
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:12,929
and quit jumping the fence and go into

25
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:19,200
olcc

26
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:21,090
where everything is upside down right

27
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,969
now the Oregon Health Authority is

28
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:28,400
proposing to limit medical marijuana

29
00:01:23,969 --> 00:01:36,840
growers to three immature plants below

30
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:40,890
24 inches you can't even grow radishes

31
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:43,200
like that let alone a fragile plant a

32
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:50,219
fragile strain that's really helping

33
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:52,950
three or four year patients so stay

34
00:01:50,219 --> 00:01:54,780
abreast of what's going on with the OHA

35
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:58,799
the rules Advisory Committee is meeting

36
00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:01,710
on Monday and after that they'll

37
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,840
establish the public comment period

38
00:02:01,709 --> 00:02:06,959
which is about 30 days of being able to

39
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,848
write in and express your concerns if I

40
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:11,949
don't get that number for immature

41
00:02:08,848 --> 00:02:14,259
plants up to about 15 to 1

42
00:02:11,949 --> 00:02:16,689
we're gonna have a little bit of a

43
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:18,609
revolution because I'm gonna call on all

44
00:02:16,689 --> 00:02:22,030
you patients and all you growers to help

45
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:24,340
us with this I've been a lobbyist I was

46
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:26,979
the first paid marijuana lobbyist in

47
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:29,770
this state in 1985 I've been doing it

48
00:02:26,979 --> 00:02:32,079
off and on for a long time and I will

49
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:34,600
tell you that we need your help in the

50
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:38,500
legislature but what I have avoided

51
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:40,810
doing because of my experience in the

52
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:42,939
legislature and because I know that when

53
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:45,699
you go speak to the committee you get

54
00:02:42,939 --> 00:02:48,250
two minutes I'm not I'm not willing to

55
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:51,699
ask patients that are in wheelchairs and

56
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:54,009
oxygen 24/7 or in a hospital bed and an

57
00:02:51,699 --> 00:02:56,829
assisted living facility to come in and

58
00:02:54,009 --> 00:02:58,929
participate in that I'm not going to ask

59
00:02:56,830 --> 00:03:00,489
them to sit on a commission that has to

60
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:02,500
struggle through hours and hours of

61
00:03:00,489 --> 00:03:06,009
debate to come up with good rules to

62
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:07,870
help these but I am going to ask you to

63
00:03:06,009 --> 00:03:09,729
come to the listening tour for the

64
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:12,489
Oregon cannabis Commission that will

65
00:03:09,729 --> 00:03:15,879
probably happen this fall make your

66
00:03:12,489 --> 00:03:19,120
voices heard we're down to 45,000

67
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:21,909
patients we cannot let this continue we

68
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:24,459
are in crisis mode and without patient

69
00:03:21,909 --> 00:03:26,919
health without the patient voice we're

70
00:03:24,459 --> 00:03:28,060
going to lose our program I have done

71
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:30,789
all I can

72
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:32,049
compassionate Oregon has added PTSD

73
00:03:30,789 --> 00:03:36,179
we've hadded

74
00:03:32,049 --> 00:03:38,409
the bill persistent and degenerative

75
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:40,420
neurological condition so now you can

76
00:03:38,409 --> 00:03:43,109
get a cannabis card for spectral

77
00:03:40,419 --> 00:03:48,849
disorders and lupus and Lyme disease and

78
00:03:43,109 --> 00:03:50,799
and give me an ALS so stick with the

79
00:03:48,849 --> 00:03:53,079
program otherwise we're gonna lose it

80
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,849
give me a year or so on this commission

81
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:57,189
to get things turned around a little bit

82
00:03:54,849 --> 00:04:00,039
I am NOT the chair I am NOT the only

83
00:03:57,189 --> 00:04:03,009
cannabis commissioner I am on the Oregon

84
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:06,840
cannabis Commission which compassionate

85
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:09,789
Oregon had enacted in the 2017 session

86
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:12,729
so this commission was put together to

87
00:04:09,789 --> 00:04:16,209
address medical patient concerns right

88
00:04:12,729 --> 00:04:17,680
up front so when so we have the concerns

89
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:19,870
about doctors not giving us the

90
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,370
appropriate medications they're not

91
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:23,348
giving they're kicking us off pain

92
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:25,538
management programs they're telling us

93
00:04:23,348 --> 00:04:26,050
we can't be dead day care providers

94
00:04:25,538 --> 00:04:28,509
because we

95
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:30,400
have a card we can't be on a transplant

96
00:04:28,509 --> 00:04:32,288
list and if we are on a transplant list

97
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:35,620
we can't be active users of cannabis

98
00:04:32,288 --> 00:04:38,199
that's saving our damn lives so those

99
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:40,720
patients you've got to come to the table

100
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:43,840
I can't hold them back any longer

101
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:46,479
they're gonna take over this program and

102
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:50,560
you will be at the mercy of the Oregon

103
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:52,889
Liquor Control Commission enjoy the rest

104
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,889
of your day
