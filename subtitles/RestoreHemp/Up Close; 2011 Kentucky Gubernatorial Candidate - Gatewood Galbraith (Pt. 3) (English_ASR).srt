1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:05,400
you know back in the early 90s after you

2
00:00:02,678 --> 00:00:06,878
met Willie Nelson uh I was honored to

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:09,679
get a call from you and say Willie

4
00:00:06,878 --> 00:00:11,359
Nelson's going to contact you and I I

5
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:13,798
could hardly believe it actually when

6
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:15,480
you called and told me that but you know

7
00:00:13,798 --> 00:00:17,920
less than a couple weeks later that

8
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:21,079
really happened I really appreciate that

9
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:24,400
but then about 3 weeks after that I flew

10
00:00:21,079 --> 00:00:27,079
there to Lexington and starting at the

11
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:30,320
Hyatt Regency right next to is it rup

12
00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:33,079
Auditorium rup Arena rup Arena you took

13
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:36,759
off in your red Mercedes-Benz station

14
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:39,039
wagon and drove uh in a hemp biodiesel

15
00:00:36,759 --> 00:00:42,199
car could you tell our audience a little

16
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:43,759
bit how how that came about and how you

17
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,679
actually first taught Willie Nelson

18
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:48,640
who's now a big proponent of biodiesel

19
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:50,320
about H biodiesel we' always heard that

20
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,198
Rudolph diesel had manufactured his

21
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,799
diesel engine runoff seedo we really

22
00:00:52,198 --> 00:00:58,960
didn't understand quite grasp that this

23
00:00:54,799 --> 00:01:01,518
was in the early '90s late 80s and then

24
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,920
a fellow from Nevada Las Vegas Nevada

25
00:01:01,518 --> 00:01:05,239
came through town driving a little

26
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:08,719
Volkswagen diesel and he was running it

27
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:10,920
off Burger King oil and so we had just

28
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:14,079
uh derived some hemp oil out of hemp

29
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:16,118
seeds hemp seeds are 30 to 40% oil by

30
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:18,599
weight you got 100 lounds of hemp seeds

31
00:01:16,118 --> 00:01:21,200
you can drive 30 to 40 PBS of pure oil

32
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:23,679
out of it and so we had some of that and

33
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,640
he tested it out in his engine and he

34
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,680
said this is the best seedor that I've

35
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:31,079
ever driven this car on and so we had

36
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,560
seedor when Willie came in to do a

37
00:01:31,078 --> 00:01:35,839
benefit concert for me we poured that

38
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:39,478
hemp oil into my Mercedes diesel and

39
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:41,399
drove it about 110 mil across Kentucky

40
00:01:39,478 --> 00:01:43,359
and it was the first time in I guess 50

41
00:01:41,399 --> 00:01:45,519
to 60 years that any vehicle had ever

42
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:48,799
been driven on depoil on the United

43
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:51,759
States roads but Willie told me later on

44
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:53,880
12 years later actually no I mean now

45
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:56,478
about 10 years later he says gate wood

46
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:58,319
he says that afternoon we did that

47
00:01:56,478 --> 00:02:00,319
taught me what it was all about and

48
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:02,158
that's the reason I started my bio fuel

49
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:04,038
company was from what we learned that

50
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,200
afternoon driving your Mercedes across

51
00:02:04,039 --> 00:02:08,280
there and we also smoking about the

52
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:10,000
biggest Hooter at probably Road in

53
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:13,640
Kentucky at the time and there was a

54
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,239
caravan of us we went from uh the Hyatt

55
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:18,679
there and and R Auditorium through

56
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:21,800
Frankfurt the state capital which is

57
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:24,319
about 80 Mi and then alog together 120

58
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:27,280
Mi all the way into Louisville which is

59
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:29,719
the largest uh city in Kentucky and then

60
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,479
he did a big benefit concert for you

61
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:35,080
there there that night that's right and

62
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:37,518
so uh it was a real honor to participate

63
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:39,440
that in that and I know CNN uh had their

64
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:42,719
environmental show earthwatch and they

65
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:46,759
covered that pretty intensely so you're

66
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:49,239
running for governor again if you were

67
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:53,439
elected what are the top three action

68
00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:56,800
items that you would enact as

69
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:59,878
Governor you know Kentucky is a

70
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:03,319
dysfunctional State uh We've not been

71
00:02:59,878 --> 00:03:05,399
able to pass a a balanced budget in uh

72
00:03:03,318 --> 00:03:07,958
in four out of the last seven sessions

73
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:10,239
we've had to go to special sessions and

74
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:12,560
advanced sessions to get the actual

75
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,319
budget passed because neither party can

76
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,759
produce a candidate can disengage the

77
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:18,039
partisanship long enough to work with

78
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:20,280
the other side it's just all very

79
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:21,840
vicious and vituperative and people are

80
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,560
getting turned off with all the negative

81
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:27,280
ads and what we've got to do first and

82
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,840
formost is to restore a sense of

83
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,400
integrity and honesty and even

84
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,280
handedness in the process itself we

85
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,039
could come up with all kinds of

86
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:39,318
hypothetical programs and uh that we

87
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:42,239
could apply and let people have access

88
00:03:39,318 --> 00:03:44,639
to but it would get shredded by the uh

89
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:47,158
by the uh the policies of fear and

90
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:50,318
retribution on the state level so we've

91
00:03:47,158 --> 00:03:52,798
got to return uh integrity and Trust in

92
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:55,000
the process itself uh in state of

93
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,519
Kentucky it's very poor we we're among

94
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,799
the third or fourth poorest state in the

95
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:01,599
Union we've got 23 states of app 23

96
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:04,640
counties of Appalachia which are the

97
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:08,158
poorest uh regions of the Union of the

98
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:12,039
states so uh we need to

99
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:13,679
uh uh we need to uh uh get people

100
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:15,158
interested in the process again because

101
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,239
nobody wants anything to do with it it's

102
00:04:15,158 --> 00:04:19,759
just so dirty and mean and Despicable

103
00:04:17,238 --> 00:04:21,918
and everybody's calling everybody I've

104
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,520
run before where I said I believe all my

105
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:25,159
opponents are Honorable Men and what

106
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:27,799
they're saying about each other is true

107
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:30,800
which makes them all unfit for office

108
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:32,918
you know but uh so so the first thing is

109
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,879
to try to restore that integrity and the

110
00:04:32,918 --> 00:04:38,519
way we we do that is by giving everybody

111
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:40,519
a chance to do right uh you know we

112
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:42,799
cannot oppose these people we can't

113
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:44,439
overpower them we've got to control them

114
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:48,639
into doing what they believe is right

115
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:50,519
for the people in ky's Dynamics for 40

116
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,319
years the Democrats ruled everything

117
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:53,680
that the Republicans didn't have any

118
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:54,959
didn't have the house didn't have the

119
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,199
Senate and didn't have the governor's

120
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:59,758
office for 40 years the Democrats ruled

121
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:03,240
over the Republicans and treated them

122
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:05,479
like and so uh 10 years ago the

123
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:07,199
Republicans took over the Senate and

124
00:05:05,478 --> 00:05:10,038
they've been practicing the politics of

125
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,120
Retribution for the last 10 years and

126
00:05:10,038 --> 00:05:12,639
you know they've been treating the

127
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,038
Democrats like they got treated for

128
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,120
those 40 years and the Democrats don't

129
00:05:14,038 --> 00:05:18,839
know what to do they're screaming like

130
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:21,800
scalded dogs you know but they did it to

131
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:23,119
the Republicans and so uh the fell

132
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,319
there's been one fellow who's doing it

133
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,639
he's called The Bully uh the leader of

134
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:29,960
the Senate and you know he is a bully

135
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:32,000
and he can be other than Charming on

136
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:33,279
many occasions but he's just giving the

137
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,478
Democrats what it is they gave the

138
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:37,038
Republicans all that time so what I'm

139
00:05:35,478 --> 00:05:39,599
telling the people state of Kentucky

140
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:41,599
look it's time to stop practicing the

141
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,319
politics of Retribution and get into

142
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:47,960
practicing the politics of achievement

143
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:50,439
you know we can no longer you know be

144
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:53,159
retributive and because it's killing the

145
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:55,680
state of Kentucky we're bankrupt we're

146
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:59,000
absolutely desperate for cash and that's

147
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:01,199
why I believe that my plan to

148
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,918
immediately start planting hemp as a gas

149
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,600
crop next spring you know within 2

150
00:06:03,918 --> 00:06:08,318
months after I take over the office

151
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,280
state of Kentucky my My First Act I'm

152
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:13,479
going to do is I'm going to take the

153
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:15,038
military helicopters out from going over

154
00:06:13,478 --> 00:06:17,038
the fields and Gardens of the people of

155
00:06:15,038 --> 00:06:19,038
state of Kentucky you know this is

156
00:06:17,038 --> 00:06:20,478
America not Afghanistan and we're not an

157
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:22,918
occupied territory and I'm not going to

158
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:24,519
treat our citizens like we are one I'm

159
00:06:22,918 --> 00:06:27,598
going to take the Army and the National

160
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:29,240
Guard out of police activities they're

161
00:06:27,598 --> 00:06:30,279
no longer going to be assisting State

162
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,720
Police

163
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:33,638
those helicopters are going to be used

164
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,759
for emergency medical and disaster

165
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:38,519
relief

166
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:40,280
only and so we're going to revolutionize

167
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:42,680
the relationship between the police and

168
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:45,198
the people there's no longer going to be

169
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:47,560
an US versus them kind of attitude

170
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:50,720
that's going to be we and there's going

171
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:53,199
to be respect given and don't come in

172
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,199
here and mess up don't come in here and

173
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:57,639
confuse our Civility and statesmanship

174
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,960
with being weak on anything we're

175
00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:02,918
not but we're going to start treating

176
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:04,719
people as Sovereign human beings we're

177
00:07:02,918 --> 00:07:06,439
going to get marijuana into the hands of

178
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,160
medic the sick and dying folks

179
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:11,680
immediately as soon as we can are we're

180
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:14,560
going to try to set up a a evenhanded

181
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:17,038
tax regulatory system on it so we can

182
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,000
get some new tax money in instead of

183
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:21,360
taxing uh you know instead of putting

184
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,800
more taxes on the wage earner here in

185
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,400
the state I mean let's face it uh the if

186
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,400
we just took the profits of the drug

187
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:31,318
lords and put them into our educational

188
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:34,000
system it'd be soled

189
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:36,919
overnight saw a bust of a drug lower

190
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,038
down Mexico the other day he had 12

191
00:07:36,918 --> 00:07:41,240
billion do

192
00:07:39,038 --> 00:07:42,800
stacked stacked in a

193
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:45,120
room1

194
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:48,120
billion now that's that's the budget of

195
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:50,079
Kentucky for two years he had stack

196
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:51,560
there what we could do with education

197
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:53,279
what we could do the other thing I want

198
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:55,680
to do is I'd really like to sue the

199
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:57,038
farmaceutical companies and make them

200
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,319
come up with hundreds of millions of

201
00:07:57,038 --> 00:08:01,560
dollars in drug treatment programs for

202
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:02,919
the uh for the problems that they're

203
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,720
solving with their pharmaceutical

204
00:08:02,918 --> 00:08:05,719
medicine
