5
00:00:14,798 --> 00:00:20,839
own let's not have to pay a big

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,480
fee and let's just keep some of it in

7
00:00:20,839 --> 00:00:23,719
the hands of the people I mean I know a

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,920
lot of good people that grow a lot of

9
00:00:23,719 --> 00:00:28,598
good medicine a lot of go herb and they

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,640
should be able to continue to do that uh

11
00:00:28,599 --> 00:00:32,520
Vivian just said about the Cannabis

12
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,878
economy and I got to tell you that is

13
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:37,520
exactly what we need we need the wealth

14
00:00:34,878 --> 00:00:40,079
of hampen cannabis through mom and pop

15
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,320
small businesses all across Washington

16
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:45,960
we need it in the Farms we need it in

17
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:48,159
Boutique Winery style grows where uh

18
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,840
cannabis tourists can come and take a

19
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:54,799
little bus trip and all of that we need

20
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:57,120
to grow hemp in the Okanagan area

21
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:59,119
because that ground there some of that

22
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:01,479
is so bad it would just benefit from him

23
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:04,118
so much and the people there the

24
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:07,039
unemployment is so high that they would

25
00:01:04,118 --> 00:01:10,040
have living wage jobs and I want to

26
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:12,118
remind you all this can happen but we've

27
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:16,759

34
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:35,840
currently on the ballot will pass or

35
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:39,000
fail with the PE of people of Washington

36
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:41,040
on its own merits I advise each and

37
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,438
every one of you to number one go out

38
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:47,479
and register to vote and number two read

39
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:49,398
what you are voting on don't listen to

40
00:01:47,478 --> 00:01:51,718
what anybody tells you because you're

41
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:55,680
smart enough to read this for yourself

42
00:01:51,718 --> 00:01:58,319
it's a long read 68 pages but know what

43
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,399
you're voting on anybody vote on alcohol

44
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:02,839
and then we had a sudden surprise of hey

45
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:05,960
where' that extra 30% tax come from

46
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:09,719
there you go right there you know what

47
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:11,560
make sure you read it okay after

48
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:13,800
November it is either going to pass or

49
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:16,560
fail and I want to let you know that a

50
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:19,000
lot of people that aren't happy with 502

51
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,400
are are not quitting we are not you know

52
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,439
502 is not the Beall and endall of

53
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,319
cannabis reform certainly not in

54
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:27,519
Washington state and the fact that we're

55
00:02:25,318 --> 00:02:29,000
running this right now proves that

56
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:30,879
there's another group that's well known

57
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,519
in Washington State for running

58
00:02:30,878 --> 00:02:34,759
initiatives and I hear that they may or

59
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:38,239
may not Run Initiative in

60
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:41,359
2013 but it doesn't matter if it's us or

61
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:43,319
them or whoever else comes next until

62
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,959
cannabis is legal for each and every one

63
00:02:43,318 --> 00:02:48,318
of you and your families and loved ones

64
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:51,560
and friends and neighbors to

65
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:54,399
benefit absolutely benefit from having

66
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:56,920
cannabis available to you I don't know

67
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,560
what to else to tell you we will not

68
00:02:56,919 --> 00:03:01,238
quit

69
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,400
legalization is the safest access for

70
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:05,080
our

71
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,519
patients you know when you put it into

72
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:09,159
the economy where anybody can give it

73
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:11,239
away or trade it or hand it over your

74
00:03:09,158 --> 00:03:14,039
fence like a zucchini to your

75
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:16,039
neighbor the quality there's no reason

76
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:18,519
why it can't stay up because we all

77
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:21,158
believe in it but there's every reason

78
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:23,560
why the price should go down and I want

79
00:03:21,158 --> 00:03:25,560
you to consider that when that price

80
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:28,239
goes down you can either shove it into

81
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:30,120
the hands of the government to use what

82
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,080
they want or you can keep keep that

83
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,719
money in your own pockets and go spend

84
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,879
it out in your own neighborhoods your

85
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:39,080
own communities and grow your business

86
00:03:36,878 --> 00:03:40,959
imagine all the money currently spent on

87
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:44,439
cannabis now going into the legitimate

88
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:46,680
economy you know full-time jobs benefits

89
00:03:44,438 --> 00:03:47,878
for people and I want to also tell you

90
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:50,640
when you can grow your own in the

91
00:03:47,878 --> 00:03:54,679
backyard how much energy are we going to

92
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:57,518
save all those thousand watt lights not

93
00:03:54,680 --> 00:04:00,040
burning oh my God P sound energy is not

94
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,480
going to know what to do because our

95
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:02,878
energy bills are going to go down

96
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:05,639
because we'll have a

97
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:06,679
surplus there is so much I want you to

98
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:08,919

122
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:09,880
please read it I love it it was written

123
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,600
by uh a father who's worried about

124
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:12,839
cannabis being in in the schools when

125
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,520
his kids are going there when he wants

126
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:19,119
them to concentrate on their schoolwork

127
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:23,279
and this guy is a consumer and a patient

128
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:25,918
and he knows he doesn't want the highest

129
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:29,318
paid job for a high school student drop

130
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:31,519
out or otherwise to be drug dealer he

131
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:33,680
doesn't want our patients that have had

132
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:35,478
their access in Eastern Washington cut

133
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,079
off and if you haven't heard about it

134
00:05:35,478 --> 00:05:40,318
you know spoke H was first wachi is now

135
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:43,038
facing problems you know Seattle could

136
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:45,160
be coming next you know thiron County we

137
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:48,120
don't know what they'll do but when we

138
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:50,800
speak out with a voice and tell them no

139
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:53,000
we're going to have it for ourselves and

140
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,759
we're going to set the rules that's

141
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,560
where they're going to have to

142
00:05:54,759 --> 00:06:01,319
listen we don't create any law when you

143
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:05,000
create law you conflict with the federal

144
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:06,879
government and you lose we do what

145
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,560
sensible Washington has done for the

146
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:12,240
past few years and that's remove the

147
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:15,240
penalties for adults and when you do

148
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:18,360
that the federal government is forced to

149
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:19,680
use its own resources to come after us

150
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:23,240
just like they did with alcohol

151
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:26,519
prohibition back in the 20s and the 30s

152
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:28,400
so don't let them have it we take away

153
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:30,318
the penalties we don't want the big

154
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:35,598
cartels coming in

155
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:38,639
we limit a grow size to 400 square ft

156
00:06:35,598 --> 00:06:41,478
which is about 20 by 20 if you live in a

157
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:44,319
rural area that's a nice outdoor Garden

158
00:06:41,478 --> 00:06:47,279
because we need a legitimate source of

159
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:50,039
good cannabis in Washington state we

160
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:52,279
don't want to encourage the cartels to

161
00:06:50,038 --> 00:06:55,120
come in with huge grows out in the

162
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:57,878
forest and everything else we should be

163
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:02,038
able to come together as individuals and

164
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:05,520
collect our 400 square feet together and

165
00:07:02,038 --> 00:07:07,240
