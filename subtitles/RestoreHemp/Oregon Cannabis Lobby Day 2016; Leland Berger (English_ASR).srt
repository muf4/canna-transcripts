1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,820
hey everybody thanks for coming this

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:13,109
afternoon to the state capitol to rally

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:18,509
about our efforts to continue to improve

4
00:00:13,109 --> 00:00:22,799
on the reforms brought by by ballot

5
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:26,880
measure 91 and and to help protect the

6
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:29,910
Medical Marijuana Act things are

7
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:31,609
changing very rapidly and I'm not sure

8
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:33,630
that we're all on the same page

9
00:00:31,609 --> 00:00:35,820
necessarily and I'm not sure that my

10
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:38,300
information is the most current

11
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:41,640
information but people should know that

12
00:00:38,299 --> 00:00:44,909
what differentiates this lightning round

13
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:47,789
round short session from previous

14
00:00:44,909 --> 00:00:51,359
sessions is that the legislature has

15
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:53,189
been responsive to our concerns they've

16
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:54,780
been in touch with the Health Authority

17
00:00:53,189 --> 00:00:57,030
and the Health Authority has pulled back

18
00:00:54,780 --> 00:01:00,899
on some of the rules they were going to

19
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:03,390
impose on medical marijuana growers the

20
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:06,090
senate co-chair at last week's meeting

21
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:08,430
announced that instead of march first as

22
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:14,100
a date for grandfathering that it would

23
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:16,070
be May first so so you know we are

24
00:01:14,099 --> 00:01:20,009
seeing progress we are seeing

25
00:01:16,069 --> 00:01:22,319
improvement we are seeing you know some

26
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:24,269
good technical Corrections we all left

27
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:26,839
those of us who've been coming here for

28
00:01:24,269 --> 00:01:29,938
a while I've been coming here since 1999

29
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:31,650
will remember that last session we left

30
00:01:29,938 --> 00:01:33,149
the building thinking that as long as it

31
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:35,939
was a private club and didn't have

32
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:38,640
employees there could be cannabis cafes

33
00:01:35,938 --> 00:01:40,169
and then when the health authority

34
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:44,519
issued rules that said that couldn't

35
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:47,009
happen we contacted legislators and

36
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:48,929
there's an amendment of 15 11 that's

37
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:52,109
being proposed to amend the indoor Clean

38
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:54,750
Air Act to allow for cannabis cafes

39
00:01:52,109 --> 00:01:57,390
thanks mostly to the good work of

40
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:59,209
Harrison Connelly a former Legislative

41
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:01,890
Council has been lobbying on behalf of

42
00:01:59,209 --> 00:02:05,449
the world-famous cannabis cafe in

43
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:05,450
Madeleine Martinez

44
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:11,129
I was a little surprised to hear about

45
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:14,640
this rally since or you know just

46
00:02:11,129 --> 00:02:16,379
because usually there's more kind of

47
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:18,539
advance notice it gives people an

48
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:20,579
opportunity to get in touch with their

49
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:23,009
legislators and legislators from the

50
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:26,790
what's now the Joint Committee on

51
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:30,870
legalizing marijuana and I just want to

52
00:02:26,789 --> 00:02:33,929
encourage you all to to do that to make

53
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:36,509
those appointments and to schedule times

54
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:37,920
and to visit with people if it's not

55
00:02:36,509 --> 00:02:40,620
likely going to be able to see anybody

56
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:42,659
today but you can certainly come back

57
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:45,750
while the legislature is in session or

58
00:02:42,659 --> 00:02:48,000
in between sessions is an especially

59
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:50,729
good time to catch up with legislators

60
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,469
and because part of the problem is you

61
00:02:50,729 --> 00:02:55,049
know I thought I'd say I've been coming

62
00:02:52,469 --> 00:02:57,479
here since 99 and that I've been then

63
00:02:55,050 --> 00:03:00,930
you know sandy Burbank was here Laird

64
00:02:57,479 --> 00:03:03,090
funk sometimes John say Joe would come

65
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:05,550
down from the mountain you know and and

66
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:08,550
me and the only person in the building

67
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:11,100
that was being paid to be here every day

68
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:13,380
that was on our team was the was the

69
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:15,269
ACLU and it was like that more or less

70
00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:18,389
for a long time Madeleine and others

71
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:23,310
were here in 2005 when we passed Senate

72
00:03:18,389 --> 00:03:25,139
bill was it 1805 1705 whatever number

73
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:29,129
was the bill that expanded the Medical

74
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:31,109
Marijuana Act but last session suddenly

75
00:03:29,129 --> 00:03:35,099
there was an explosion of lobbyists on

76
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:38,010
our issues and they were lobbyists for

77
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:40,129
the industry for different portions of

78
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:43,919
the industry for individualized

79
00:03:40,129 --> 00:03:45,870
companies and some for organization

80
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:48,419
including the Sun grown growers guild in

81
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:50,430
the Oregon cannabis Association but but

82
00:03:48,419 --> 00:03:55,409
the problem is that there wasn't anybody

83
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:59,489
here for the consumers for us and so I

84
00:03:55,409 --> 00:04:02,310
went and met with folks at the Portland

85
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:07,250
normal and started a legislative

86
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:11,459
committee and a Lindsay Reinhart who's

87
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:14,099
are not here right this minute is is now

88
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:17,048
the voice of consumers in this building

89
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:18,310
so if you if you have if you

90
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:19,959
is that you think are important to

91
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:22,538
consumers that you want in front of

92
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:29,168
legislators get that information get

93
00:04:22,538 --> 00:04:32,079
that information to to Lindsay um yeah I

94
00:04:29,168 --> 00:04:34,120
think I think that's that's mostly it I

95
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:36,430
think that that you know the important

96
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:38,530
thing is I know that people get together

97
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:40,930
and rally when they're angry and upset

98
00:04:38,529 --> 00:04:44,198
and there's a sense of outrage but I

99
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:46,598
want folks to know that in the first

100
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:49,000
place the legislature is being

101
00:04:46,598 --> 00:04:51,158
responsive but the thing that you can

102
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,199
really do the thing that you can really

103
00:04:51,158 --> 00:05:00,610
do is a lot many legislators on the 91

104
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:02,680
committee have a bad view of the medical

105
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:04,840
marijuana program they've been misled

106
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,939
about the medical marijuana program they

107
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:09,549
believe as a matter of fact good

108
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:11,680
overwhelmingly most of the medical

109
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:14,050
cannabis is cultivated was leaving the

110
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,000
state when that's not true they believe

111
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:17,829
overwhelmingly that anybody can get a

112
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,718
card and that and that most people in

113
00:05:17,829 --> 00:05:21,339
the program or scamming the system and

114
00:05:19,718 --> 00:05:24,728
they're going to continue to believe

115
00:05:21,339 --> 00:05:26,859
that unless and until those of us who

116
00:05:24,728 --> 00:05:28,180
are honest participants in the medical

117
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:31,479
marijuana program make ourselves

118
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:34,990
available to legislators and tell them

119
00:05:31,478 --> 00:05:36,430
the truth okay cuz that you know this up

120
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:39,370
again you know some of these folks

121
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:42,069
there's a guy on the panel who's friends

122
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:44,500
with a guy who has ms they believe in

123
00:05:42,069 --> 00:05:46,479
the medicinal value we've won that

124
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:49,149
argument they don't think we're making

125
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:51,339
that stuff up but they are concerned

126
00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:53,859
about about the abuses that have been

127
00:05:51,339 --> 00:05:56,679
publicized and they are going to make

128
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:58,990
reforms to change those and including

129
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:01,329
the reforms that they made already we're

130
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:05,019
not going to get that stuff back but we

131
00:06:01,329 --> 00:06:07,658
can we can move things forward if we

132
00:06:05,019 --> 00:06:09,609
present honestly who the patients are

133
00:06:07,658 --> 00:06:11,889
who the growers are what's really going
