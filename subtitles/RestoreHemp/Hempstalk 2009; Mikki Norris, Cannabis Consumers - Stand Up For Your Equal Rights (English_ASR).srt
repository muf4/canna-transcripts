00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:21,750
from California one thing to end and I'm

6
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:24,510
also the director of the cannabis

7
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:27,629
consumers campaign which is a project

8
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:29,490
that stands out for our equal rights do

9
00:00:27,629 --> 00:00:35,519
we have any cannabis consumers out there

10
00:00:29,489 --> 00:00:38,218
today my people with the cannabis

11
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,469
consumers campaign we asked people to

12
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:43,530
come to our website cannabis consumers

13
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:46,020
org fill out a survey send us your photo

14
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:47,670
and come out of the closet and the

15
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:51,149
reason why we need to come out of the

16
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:54,329
closet is to show that we are good

17
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:58,410
contributing members of our society and

18
00:00:54,329 --> 00:01:00,628
my project that show I prove that we are

19
00:00:58,409 --> 00:01:02,608
the good people we are not criminals in

20
00:01:00,628 --> 00:01:05,670
any way and then we should not be

21
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:07,200
treated like criminals in any way we

22
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:09,868
should be treated like first-class

23
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,719
citizens that we are because we are good

24
00:01:09,868 --> 00:01:15,450
taxpaying people we are not criminals

25
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:20,158
and we don't deserve to be treated any

26
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:22,560
other way so we have to stand up to this

27
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:25,979
discrimination in society that still

28
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:29,509
exists against us we need to say no to

29
00:01:25,978 --> 00:01:32,250
drug testing which is a tool of

30
00:01:29,509 --> 00:01:35,250
discrimination against says it does not

31
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:37,019
test your impairment it doesn't test

32
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:39,900
whether or not you're qualified for the

33
00:01:37,019 --> 00:01:42,209
job all it does is test whether or not

34
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:44,880
you use cannabis in the last month or so

35
00:01:42,209 --> 00:01:47,669
and if they do hair testing it could be

36
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:50,789
in the last six months or so so it's

37
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:54,359
totally a discriminatory practice and we

38
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:56,400
need to say no to drug testing we need

39
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:59,370
to say yes we need to stamp

40
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:01,830
for our equal rights we need to stand up

41
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:05,310
for a right to be parents and to have

42
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:08,609
custody of our children we need to say

43
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:10,618
yes to our right to freedom of religion

44
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:13,530
those of us who use cannabis as a

45
00:02:10,618 --> 00:02:16,979
sacrament so many people say that they

46
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:20,370
get a spiritual effect for cannabis how

47
00:02:16,979 --> 00:02:23,519
many people get that effect feel closer

48
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:27,349
to nature feel closer to the universe

49
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:30,120
make closer to God closer to each other

50
00:02:27,349 --> 00:02:32,519
cannabis is a very healing kind of plan

51
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:35,330
to many people aside from using a for

52
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:39,030
medical benefits and thank God for that

53
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:41,100
they use it for their spirituality as

54
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:45,479
well and we need to stand up for that

55
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:48,090
right to use it in that way as well and

56
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:51,060
so in bio cute eyes and making jokes

57
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:56,000
about a short-term loss memory loss if

58
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:56,000
it i like to say stop blaming time

59
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:01,030
we need to stop blaming pot for all

60
00:02:59,259 --> 00:03:02,859
these new Medicaid you know they keep

61
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:06,219
blaming pot for all these things we need

62
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:09,130
to take personal responsibility for

63
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:10,870
ourselves and our use and that's another

64
00:03:09,129 --> 00:03:12,879
aspect of the cannabis consumers

65
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:16,360
campaign that we advocate for is

66
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:18,699
responsible use knowing when to use it

67
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:21,640
how to have a positive relationship with

68
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:24,099
it that most of us already have and to

69
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:27,159
keep it as a very beneficial has spent

70
00:03:24,099 --> 00:03:31,030
in our lives so we know we need to know

71
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:33,609
when to use it when to say no how much

72
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:35,979
we want to use it where to use it all

73
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:39,160
kinds of things like that and I have a

74
00:03:35,979 --> 00:03:40,899
fire over at the Oregon normal booth now

75
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:42,939
you can pick up that also if you do some

76
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:45,370
things to think about and how to

77
00:03:42,939 --> 00:03:50,169
maintain your your positive relationship

78
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:52,360
I'm going to take another I'm going to

79
00:03:50,169 --> 00:03:56,799
challenge Oregon here I'm from

80
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:59,980
California and while Madeleine thinks

81
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:05,530
that organ is superior I'm going to give

82
00:03:59,979 --> 00:04:07,780
a plug for California here yes cannabis

83
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:10,300
is still way too expensive and we all

84
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:12,729
agree that and I would I am firmly

85
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:16,629
behind the hundred dollar counts i think

86
00:04:12,729 --> 00:04:20,019
that sounds much fairer as a as a prize

87
00:04:16,629 --> 00:04:22,480
for your cannabis but it mean why what

88
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:27,339
we meanwhile what we're doing in

89
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:30,129
california is we've got over 800 places

90
00:04:27,339 --> 00:04:32,819
now in the state it's probably close to

91
00:04:30,129 --> 00:04:35,290
a thousand and including delivery

92
00:04:32,819 --> 00:04:37,779
services where people can buy cannabis

93
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:39,590
over the counter with your doctor's

94
00:04:37,779 --> 00:04:43,609
recommendation

95
00:04:39,589 --> 00:04:46,099
and we have over 300,000 people

96
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:48,170
registered as cannabis patients now

97
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:51,050
because our program is not quite as

98
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:53,480
restrictive as yours pretty much anybody

99
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:55,490
who gets a medical benefit out of

100
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:58,759
cannabis can can get their doctor's

101
00:04:55,490 --> 00:05:01,340
recommendation today so we're proud of

102
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:04,069
what we've accomplished in California in

103
00:05:01,339 --> 00:05:06,859
the fact that we we do have great access

104
00:05:04,069 --> 00:05:09,349
and in the at the same time people can

105
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:13,160
grow their own and people are still

106
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:15,740
joining collectively to have their own

107
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:18,350
collectors where they can grow a certain

108
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:21,259
amount of cannabis and it's kind of like

109
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:24,710
it's unbelievable but we need to

110
00:05:21,259 --> 00:05:26,719
actually go the next step and that's

111
00:05:24,709 --> 00:05:30,019
what's happening also in California we

112
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:32,420
have a Assemblyman Tom Ammiano has

113
00:05:30,019 --> 00:05:35,449
introduced some legislation that will

114
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:38,480
legalize tax and regulate cannabis for

115
00:05:35,449 --> 00:05:41,029
adults in the state legislature and

116
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:44,330
governor schwarzenegger has said it's

117
00:05:41,029 --> 00:05:49,609
time for a debate there because we have

118
00:05:44,329 --> 00:05:52,099
such severe economic shortfalls within

119
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:53,870
the budget we have such a severe crisis

120
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:55,850
and they're cutting programs left and

121
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:58,910
right and we need to start thinking

122
00:05:55,850 --> 00:06:02,450
about the Jenna fee revenue stream that

123
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:04,070
could come into California and our board

124
00:06:02,449 --> 00:06:06,469
of equalization or state board of

125
00:06:04,069 --> 00:06:08,779
equalization even said that they

126
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:11,600
believed that with the legal market in

127
00:06:08,779 --> 00:06:15,349
California at minimum we could expect to

128
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:17,180
get 1.3 billion dollars of tax revenue

129
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:18,569
from our cannabis consumers in

130
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:21,119
California

131
00:06:18,569 --> 00:06:24,509
now that's a lot of money and people can

132
00:06:21,119 --> 00:06:27,270
use that to help get health care to help

133
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:29,729
our education the poor students are

134
00:06:27,269 --> 00:06:32,338
paying for the prison population right

135
00:06:29,728 --> 00:06:34,860
now and we should not be doing that on

136
00:06:32,338 --> 00:06:37,139
the back we should not be paying for the

137
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:40,770
prison's by raising tuition rates on

138
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:43,079
college students it's just not right and

139
00:06:40,769 --> 00:06:46,948
we also have a prison system that needs

140
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:49,709
to release according to the judges in

141
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:52,050
California we need to release 27,000

142
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:53,519
people for my prisons and we say the

143
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:56,369
least I why don't we start with the

144
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:58,680
medical with the marijuana prisoners as

145
00:06:56,369 --> 00:07:01,619
they do not deserve to be in prison in

146
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:05,999
the first place so we're asking that for

147
00:07:01,619 --> 00:07:08,069
that we also have three initiatives that

148
00:07:05,999 --> 00:07:10,830
have been filed to legalize tax and

149
00:07:08,069 --> 00:07:12,990
regulate Canada's for adults in

150
00:07:10,829 --> 00:07:15,300
California so things are happening there

151
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:17,309
we'll see if they make it to the ballot

152
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:20,069
that there's a very good chance of one

153
00:07:17,309 --> 00:07:23,338
of them will and we might be voting on

154
00:07:20,069 --> 00:07:26,098
that in 2010 we'll see stay tuned the

155

00:07:52,918 --> 00:08:00,088
that are standing up for us how to get

168
00:07:56,430 --> 00:08:02,610
involved with reform because we do need

169
00:08:00,088 --> 00:08:05,819
all of you to get involved together

170
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:08,729
believe me together we are a big force

171
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:12,838
they estimate somewhere around 15

172
00:08:08,728 --> 00:08:15,029
million to 20 million cannabis consumers

173
00:08:12,838 --> 00:08:17,399
in this country today

174
00:08:15,029 --> 00:08:19,169
now there's no excuse for a prohibition

175
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:21,120
with those kinds of numbers but the

176
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:24,060
reason is is that we need to get active

177
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:26,280
and you need to get involved and we need

178
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:28,319
to come out of the closet we need to

179
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:30,029
show them that we are the good people

180
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:33,629
that they don't need to waste any more

181
00:08:30,029 --> 00:08:35,610
money I'm prohibiting cannabis that it's

182
00:08:33,629 --> 00:08:38,370
a waste of our resources a waste of

183
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:42,720
police resources that could go for much

184
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:45,000
better uses so we ask you just to think

185
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:48,060
about how you can come out how you can

186
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,340
get involved and we're counting on you

187
00:08:48,059 --> 00:08:52,069
and the next time we come to hempfest

188
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:54,149
hopefully we'll have some more good news

189
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:56,670
but it's going to take all of you to

190
00:08:54,149 --> 00:08:59,069
make that happen so thank you stand up

191
00:08:56,669 --> 00:09:02,449
for equal rights we deserve nothing less

192
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:02,450
thank you very much
