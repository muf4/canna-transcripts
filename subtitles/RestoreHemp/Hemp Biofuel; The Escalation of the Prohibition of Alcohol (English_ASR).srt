1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,480
well one of the things we were

2
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:06,719
discussing just a little while ago was

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:09,519
Henry Ford's hemp car right grown right

4
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:12,320
he made an external body uh with hemp

5
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:14,798
fiber and oil and some other seed oils

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,640
you I've got videos on our website and

7
00:00:14,798 --> 00:00:18,920
have for 10 years where they swing a

8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,118
sledgehammer at it it bounces off and it

9
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:25,840
doesn't scratch the the body of the car

10
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:27,839
it's kind of a uh Prelude to fiberglass

11
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:30,480
but perhaps a better alternative mhm

12
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:32,799
like hemp glass yeah exactly

13
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,239
so Ford was a was a total Pioneer and we

14
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:37,558
cover pieces of his life in the film one

15
00:00:35,238 --> 00:00:40,000
of the things that Ford did around that

16
00:00:37,558 --> 00:00:42,839
same time that he built groan is he

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,960
actually created an ethanol facility in

18
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:48,800
the US wow and he was turning hemp and

19
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,840
other products into ethanol uhhuh now

20
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:53,119
there was a guy at that time named

21
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:55,359
Rockefeller right Standard Oil Standard

22
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:56,799
Oil good friend of Andrew melon exactly

23
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:59,440
Secretary of the Treasury for several

24
00:00:56,799 --> 00:01:01,399
administrations right so and this is all

25
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:03,280
during the time of you know Hurst and

26
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:05,760
this whole this whole sort of global

27
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,159
power play was starting to be created

28
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,439
well Ford had a completely different

29
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:13,200
idea not only did he grow his car but he

30
00:01:10,438 --> 00:01:15,599
wanted to grow Fuel and his ethanol

31
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,960
facility got about 25% of the fuel

32
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:19,359
Market in the Midwest and you know

33
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:21,879
Rockefeller said we've got to do

34
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:23,680
something about this guy so Rockefeller

35
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:25,359
started funding something that became

36
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,880
known as the women's Christian

37
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:31,759
Temperance Union ah I've heard of them

38
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:35,798
yeah yeah this was what Circa

39
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:39,040
1930 or 25 well right before prohibition

40
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:40,680
so 1915 or something like that exactly

41
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,960
and and as you recall you know soon

42
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,439
after that the women's Christian

43
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:46,919
Temperance Union got together and they

44
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:50,000
created this push for people to stop

45
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:52,960
drinking alcohol right which then turned

46
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,959
into exactly which most people don't

47
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:57,519
know that the amendment to the

48
00:01:54,959 --> 00:02:00,399
Constitution that was called prohibition

49
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:02,239
was actually funded by Rockefeller

50
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:05,079
not having to do anything with drinking

51
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:08,679
alcohol but to make sure that Ford would

52
00:02:05,078 --> 00:02:10,598
stop producing alcohol ah you know that

53
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:13,039
kind of ties some strings together there

54
00:02:10,598 --> 00:02:16,039
that have flung Loosely in the wind in

55
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:18,598
terms of uh eventually leading to to

56
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:20,439
marijuana prohibition you know and and

57
00:02:18,598 --> 00:02:22,439
the whole biodiesel issue is something

58
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:25,120
that we've talked about on this show at

59
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:25,120
length
