and uh

3
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:10,138
if any of you have lost a loved one you

4
00:00:08,279 --> 00:00:13,879
know that sometimes speaking about them

5
00:00:10,138 --> 00:00:13,879
gets a little tough so bear with me

6
00:00:16,699 --> 00:00:19,940
my father

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:27,859
inspired people

8
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,859
he helped Inspire the people that

9
00:00:28,018 --> 00:00:32,119
started this event

10
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:34,739
s in California

11
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:37,738
helped to change laws

12
00:00:34,738 --> 00:00:40,259
help to protect people's rights

13
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:42,539
fought for the wrongful persecution and

14
00:00:40,259 --> 00:00:44,960
prosecution of innocent victims of the

15
00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:44,960
drug war

16
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,160
he went from state to state around this

17
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,320
country

18
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:58,439
and uh

19
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:03,739
he taught everybody that he could spoke

20
00:00:58,439 --> 00:01:03,738
to everybody Rich poor old young

21
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:07,978
not only did he try to teach them but he

22
00:01:06,118 --> 00:01:10,200
also listened to them listened to what

23
00:01:07,978 --> 00:01:12,000
their fears were and listen to what

24
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,460
their hopes would be

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,938
a lot of people say you know

26
00:01:14,459 --> 00:01:21,179
your father left you a great legacy

27
00:01:17,938 --> 00:01:23,819
with his book with his words with the

28
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:26,220
people that he inspired

29
00:01:23,819 --> 00:01:29,639
but in all honesty

30
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:32,759
I think the Legacy that he left

31
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:34,560
was what I see in everybody at every one

32
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:36,000
of these events around the states that

33
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:40,340
I've been to

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,340
you are my father's True Legacy

35
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:46,920
through his words

36
00:01:44,578 --> 00:01:49,438
and hopefully

37
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,600
how he's inspired you to show up at

38
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:56,539

39
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:56,539
participate create new health Commerce

40
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,978
that will create changes in the future

41
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:05,519
because you are the roads to the Future

42
00:02:01,978 --> 00:02:07,200
and the bridges that we must create and

43
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:10,799
cross

44
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:14,659
to educate the other side of this

45
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,660
movement and that is the uneducated

46
00:02:15,259 --> 00:02:23,598
a year ago this weekend

47
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:23,599
my father stood on this stage

48
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:33,360
and expressed his feelings for the

49
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:36,599
future

50
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,220
that without hemp as our future we would

51
00:02:36,598 --> 00:02:42,060
have no future

52
00:02:38,219 --> 00:02:45,419
I look out across this field

53
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:47,580
and I see hope

54
00:02:45,419 --> 00:02:50,280
I see hope in the people that he loved

55
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:52,819
and cared for whether he had ever met

56
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,818
them or not

57
00:02:52,979 --> 00:02:58,679
and you

58
00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:00,780
you are the future of this movement

59
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,400
you are the future of the ways these

60
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:04,199
laws are going to change from state to

61
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:08,340

62
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:11,518
