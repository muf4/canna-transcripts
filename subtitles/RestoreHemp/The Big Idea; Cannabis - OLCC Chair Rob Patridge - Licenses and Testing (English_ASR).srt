1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,250
so no well we've had two years ago we

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:07,559
are going to pass the venue please' was

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:09,539
mission anyone that 10 that name

4
00:00:07,559 --> 00:00:11,429
recreational marijuana legal in Oregon

5
00:00:09,539 --> 00:00:13,949
since then we've had two legislative

6
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:16,829
sessions which substantially change big

7
00:00:13,949 --> 00:00:18,719
portions of the bill so the word Liquor

8
00:00:16,829 --> 00:00:21,239
Control Commission was tasked originally

9
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:23,070
with measure 91 to regulate marijuana in

10
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:25,858
Oregon and we've had some major shifts

11
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:29,250
and changes I think we're on target to

12
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:30,929
meet what our goals were as we address

13
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:33,899
the legislature with those as changes

14
00:00:30,928 --> 00:00:36,119
were made currently there are about four

15
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:38,850
hundred and seven licenses that have

16
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:42,238
been granted in Oregon about 50 of those

17
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:44,250
licenses have not yet paid here in the

18
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:48,299
state of Oregon so they can be licensed

19
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:51,058
as soon as they pay of those 357

20
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:54,509
licenses then that remain about 50 of

21
00:00:51,058 --> 00:00:57,570
those are retailers there's about a half

22
00:00:54,509 --> 00:01:00,780
dozen of those that are processors and

23
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:02,698
then there's four laboratories that have

24
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:04,650
been licensed in the state of Oregon and

25
00:01:02,698 --> 00:01:07,530
then the remainder of those are growers

26
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:10,109
so you can see we've got a big front end

27
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:12,420
market going on and that's how we've

28
00:01:10,109 --> 00:01:14,539
tried at olcc to try and prioritize

29
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:17,640
things of theming through the system

30
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:18,840
because marijuana that had that was

31
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,728
that's going to be sold in the

32
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:24,000
recreational stores had to first be

33
00:01:20,728 --> 00:01:26,099
grown and then the process your dried or

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,280
whatever form it's going to take and

35
00:01:26,099 --> 00:01:31,890
then be put out to retail so we are

36
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,829
certainly on target on the licensing

37
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:37,200
part there's certainly been some things

38
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:39,029
bouncing around and you've written about

39
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,740
others written about and there's been on

40
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:42,840
behalf those a little bit whereas what

41
00:01:40,739 --> 00:01:44,849
are some of the things that the issues

42
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,590
that have come up what one of the big

43
00:01:44,849 --> 00:01:49,379
issues though that we're hearing about

44
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:52,590
really is the is the testing network

45
00:01:49,379 --> 00:01:56,548
we're hearing about Oregon put a pretty

46
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:59,250
rigorous testing program in place i

47
00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:03,060
would say that there is a lot of the

48
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:04,500
there is on the flower side of marijuana

49
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:06,689
I don't think that there has been a

50
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:09,000
large issue related to testing I think

51
00:02:06,688 --> 00:02:12,090
most of that product has been able to

52
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,250
move to market I think on the processing

53
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:16,920
side of marijuana the oils and the other

54
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:19,830
things there are there are substantial

55
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:21,899
costs that I don't think some of the

56
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:23,760
people were prepared for the testing

57
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:28,110
methods and the amount that had to be

58
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:30,329
tested we're not anticipated the organ

59
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:32,550
theory liquor control commission doesn't

60
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:33,989
control what the what those tests have

61
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:36,780
to be actually the Oregon Health

62
00:02:33,989 --> 00:02:38,219
Authority is the one who controls what

63
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:41,129
those are but they went out the third

64
00:02:38,219 --> 00:02:44,009
party on briefs to get that testing

65
00:02:41,129 --> 00:02:46,919
regimen and it's tested my opinions and

66
00:02:44,009 --> 00:02:48,750
attested just like other food and

67
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:51,809
agricultural products that move through

68
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:54,180
the system but it's expensive and and

69
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:58,469
we're trying to deal with that capacity

70
00:02:54,180 --> 00:03:00,540
and olcc when the market came to us we

71
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:03,090
can beam with OHA and the governor's

72
00:03:00,539 --> 00:03:05,759
office and try to meet her out some of

73
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:07,799
the sort of capacity of the decision in

74
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:09,659
the pesticide testing system we're

75
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:12,239
trying to get our arms around it but you

76
00:03:09,659 --> 00:03:13,879
know when you go from a when you go from

77
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,259
a system that didn't have a lot of

78
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:19,229
testing really that was regimented

79
00:03:16,259 --> 00:03:23,039
testing now and you start your first

80
00:03:19,229 --> 00:03:24,629
report I think this week related to some

81
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:26,669
product failing on the Oregon Health

82
00:03:24,629 --> 00:03:32,699
Authority side it actually got out to

83
00:03:26,669 --> 00:03:35,099
patients it's problematic and so it's

84
00:03:32,699 --> 00:03:37,018
slowing down that process some degree

85
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:39,840
but I think we're all trying to be

86
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:41,400
responsible about it we're convening and

87
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,840
talking to the market and trying to be

88
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,769
flexible to the same time for tech

89
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,769
