1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,309
you know five years ago when I was

2
00:00:02,908 --> 00:00:07,979
running for mayor somebody asked me by

3
00:00:05,309 --> 00:00:11,279
position on marijuana legalization and

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:13,559
my answer then was if every politician

5
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:17,000
that ever smoked marijuana voted to

6
00:00:13,558 --> 00:00:21,509
legalize it to be legal in an instant

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,789
funny line right so I didn't think it

8
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:26,070
was a big deal when I ran for office

9
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:28,710
five years to come to come out for

10
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:31,079
legalization the people of Seattle and

11
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:34,250
voted to make it the lowest enforcement

12
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:37,289
priority the state had medical marijuana

13
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:40,049
but I've later discovered it was kind of

14
00:00:37,289 --> 00:00:42,539
a big deal lots of elected official lots

15
00:00:40,049 --> 00:00:44,488
of politicians weren't willing to do it

16
00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:46,019
yet there were a couple before when

17
00:00:44,488 --> 00:00:48,269
Roger good manners in the Statehouse

18
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:51,180
there's a real leader and there were

19
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:54,739
others but there weren't that many look

20
00:00:51,179 --> 00:00:57,659
at where it is five years later right

21
00:00:54,738 --> 00:01:00,689
all kids today you were to explain why

22
00:00:57,659 --> 00:01:02,488
you were pouring today I think if you're

23
00:01:00,689 --> 00:01:04,548
a politician not just in the state of

24
00:01:02,488 --> 00:01:07,920
Washington but anywhere in the country

25
00:01:04,549 --> 00:01:10,920
you're going to have to explain why are

26
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:13,829
you against it that's where this is

27
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:16,228
going and it's amazing how quickly these

28
00:01:13,829 --> 00:01:19,859
things to move and they move because

29
00:01:16,228 --> 00:01:22,319
people organized because people make a

30
00:01:19,859 --> 00:01:24,959
difference it doesn't happen because the

31
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:26,699
political leaders trust me most

32
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:29,099
politicians will only do with the

33
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:32,189
public's willing to say they want them

34
00:01:29,099 --> 00:01:33,899
to do so you all made that happen but

35
00:01:32,188 --> 00:01:36,298
while I got you here you know we're

36
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:38,790
winning this issue there's another green

37
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:40,890
issue we need to win and that's the

38
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:42,840
fight against global warming that's up

39
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:45,149
my board content so I'm gonna keep

40
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:48,359
helping you all with pot legalization

41
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:50,909
around the country but accessible was I

42
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:52,590
love you all to help me and making sure

43
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:56,830
that we make this planet right for our

44
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:59,439
children and [ __ ] over oil by cold folds

45
00:01:56,829 --> 00:02:02,189
roads and build a better future together
