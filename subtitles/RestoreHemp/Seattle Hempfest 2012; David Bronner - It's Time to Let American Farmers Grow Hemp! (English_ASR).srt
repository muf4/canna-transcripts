since 2001 to Rica Mercia lies

7
00:00:13,798 --> 00:00:19,230
industrial hemp farming in the United

8
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:22,289
States it's just incredible that we

can't grow you know non non drug

10
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:25,859
industrial hemp in this country this

11
00:00:24,089 --> 00:00:31,050
country is the largest consumer market

12
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:33,239
for hemp seed and fiber products and you

13
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:35,009
know we continue to hand the largest

14
00:00:33,238 --> 00:00:37,349
market for industrial hemp to the

15
00:00:35,009 --> 00:00:40,759
Canadians to the Chinese the Europeans

16
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:43,859
it's a joke you know I mean we have a

17
00:00:40,759 --> 00:00:46,378
president who alleges that he bases his

18
00:00:43,859 --> 00:00:49,590
policy on science and reason unlike his

19
00:00:46,378 --> 00:00:51,509
predecessor but we have the same they

20
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:53,370
all drug warriors driving policy under

21
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:55,859
this administration as as the previous

22
00:00:53,369 --> 00:00:58,909
is every other administration and it's

23
00:00:55,859 --> 00:01:02,189
an incredible incredibly disappointing

24
00:00:58,909 --> 00:01:04,618
our family sponsored and successfully

25
00:01:02,189 --> 00:01:07,679
fought off the DA's attempt to shut off

26
00:01:04,618 --> 00:01:11,400
the imports of hemp seed oil ten years

27
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:15,330
ago after Jack's Jack Harris stroke in

28
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:18,240
2010 me and some comrades dug up the

29
00:01:15,329 --> 00:01:23,129
DA's lon in Washington DC and planet

30
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:25,319
hemp seeds and you can you know look at

31
00:01:23,129 --> 00:01:27,359

34
00:01:31,078 --> 00:01:36,658
cage in front of the White House and

35
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:38,460
harvested 12 hemp plants spent three

36
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:41,310
hours hanging the president about 30

37
00:01:38,459 --> 00:01:43,828
cops and you know a huge crowd of people

38
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:45,750
about how ridiculous it is that our

39
00:01:43,828 --> 00:01:47,639
government is making my family sent over

40
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:49,849
a hundred thousand dollars every year to

41
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:52,500
Canadians in the middle of a recession

42
00:01:49,849 --> 00:01:54,509
you know what you know how [ __ ] is

43
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:57,209
it that we are still not Rica Mercia

44
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:59,849
lysing industrial hemp our family also

45
00:01:57,209 --> 00:02:01,739
we don't just concentrate on hand we

46
00:01:59,849 --> 00:02:04,259
give a lot of money to Americans for

47
00:02:01,739 --> 00:02:07,140
safe access the primary group advocating

48
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:07,920
for medical marijuana we just gave them

49
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,419
100

50
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,000
dollars you've been supporting them from

51
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:13,348
the beginning to just drop fifty

52
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,568
thousand dollars on the Colorado

53
00:02:13,348 --> 00:02:17,939
legalization efforts and on the

54

Washington effort you know we believe

55
00:02:17,939 --> 00:02:22,229
it's an earthquake if we can get the

56
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:24,000
states to go if we get Colorado and

57

you know the larger picture is you know

61
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:35,969

the good and you know it'll be just such

63
