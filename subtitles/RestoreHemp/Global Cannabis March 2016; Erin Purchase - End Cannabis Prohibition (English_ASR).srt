00:00:00,079 --> 00:00:07,108
hello Portland wow thanks for having me

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:10,290
I believe this is my third year speaking

3
00:00:07,108 --> 00:00:12,900
and this summer marks the fourth year

4
00:00:10,289 --> 00:00:18,059
that my daughter is in remission thank

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:20,070
you to cannabis oil cannabis oil

6
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:22,948
provided my seven-year-old daughter who

7
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:24,750
was fighting cancer the chance to end or

8
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:28,170
two and a half years of chemotherapy

9
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:30,448
without a single Tylenol not only that

10
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:32,219
she didn't lose a single pound and she

11
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:35,880
had a smile on her face the entire time

12
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:40,070
she fought she finished chemotherapy

13
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:44,480
about a year and a half ago and just

14
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:47,850
recently we hit one year off treatment

15
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:50,909
when we hit that mark our oncologist

16
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:53,250
came and told us that because McCalebb

17
00:00:50,909 --> 00:00:56,250
replaced brain radiation in high-dose

18
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:58,649
chemotherapy with cannabis oil she has a

19
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:02,488
lower chance of a secondary cancer

20
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:05,549
relapse because of cannabis out of every

21
00:01:02,488 --> 00:01:07,950
child that has ever endured leukemia

22
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:11,189
treatment my daughter has a lower chance

23
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:13,140
of a secondary cancer that means 10

24
00:01:11,188 --> 00:01:15,389
years from now my child's not gonna have

25
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:18,689
a brain tumor from the radiation to

26
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:21,299
treat her leukemia and to me that is

27
00:01:18,688 --> 00:01:25,618
extremely important that every child in

28
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:28,710
our country has that option so it's

29
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:31,769
great here that we have legal cannabis

30
00:01:28,709 --> 00:01:34,048
in the state of Oregon and we can smoke

31
00:01:31,769 --> 00:01:35,908
our bowls at home if we're 21 and older

32
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:38,159
and our children can be on a medical

33
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:40,200
program but that's not the way it is

34
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:44,700
across our country and our fight is not

35
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:48,420
done so please if there's anything I can

36
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:51,390
everyone to do is to not think our job

37
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:53,820
is done because our job is nowhere near

38
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:55,950
done our job is not done in our own

39
00:01:53,819 --> 00:01:59,429
state and our job is not done across our

40
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:01,950
country and across the world if I can

41
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:05,630
urge you guys all to use your voices if

42
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:08,270
you find out somebody has cancer seizure

43
00:02:05,629 --> 00:02:10,459
is epilepsy Alzheimer's any medical

44
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:13,250
condition heard him to get on the

45
00:02:10,459 --> 00:02:16,129
medical marijuana program keep our

46
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:19,009
medical marijuana program in Oregon it

47
00:02:16,129 --> 00:02:22,639
saves lives if we get rid of it my

48
00:02:19,009 --> 00:02:24,859
daughter cannot have her oil she has

49
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:27,708
been taking cannabis oil for four years

50
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:30,620
she has straight A's she's doing amazing

51
00:02:27,709 --> 00:02:32,629
in school she's surpassing all of the

52
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:36,409
expectations she's just like a normal

53
00:02:32,629 --> 00:02:38,689
child and another importance is this is

54
00:02:36,409 --> 00:02:44,030
not just CBD that I'm talking about my

55
00:02:38,689 --> 00:02:46,519
daughter takes THC psychoactive THC

56
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:49,969
there's something called a tolerance

57
00:02:46,519 --> 00:02:52,039
it's okay i promise you morphine gets

58
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:54,769
the kids higher than the cannabis oil

59
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:57,530
and I didn't have to experience morphine

60
00:02:54,769 --> 00:03:00,560
or addiction or any of that that comes

61
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:03,409
along with opioid pain medication that

62
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:06,140
they treat children with in our state in

63
00:03:03,409 --> 00:03:10,549
every other state we need to shy away

64
00:03:06,139 --> 00:03:12,649
from opioid pain medicine thank you for

65
00:03:10,549 --> 00:03:14,980

66
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:18,700

67
00:03:14,979 --> 00:03:18,699
