1986 it was fantastic and you know back

25
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:56,640
then this was just a dream no one ever

26
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:58,759
believed that we'd have millions of

27
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,719
people around the country safe because

28
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:03,000
their medical cannabis patient in legal

29
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,879
states like the state of Oregon we never

30
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,560
dreamed it could happen and it did

31
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,400
because we've never stopped trying we've

32
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,159
