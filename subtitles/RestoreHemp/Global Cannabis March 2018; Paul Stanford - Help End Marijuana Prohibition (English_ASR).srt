thank you folks thanks for coming out I

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:08,160
want to thank the folks who have put

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:11,759
this on from Madeline Martinez and Ralph

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:14,280
Martinez the Michael Baqarah Paul lo

5
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:16,138
nice Tony girls the folks who sponsored

6
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:19,019
this and thank you all for coming out

7
00:00:16,138 --> 00:00:21,358
here to represent cannabis you know this

8
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:24,059
is happening in 300 different cities

9
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:29,789
around the world so it's a global

10
00:00:24,059 --> 00:00:32,789
movement and in Santiago Chile they

11
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:34,590
actually have 450,000 people marching

12
00:00:32,789 --> 00:00:37,469
through the street and about a hundred

13
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:39,660
and fifty thousand in Buenos Aires and

14
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:42,239
once in Berlin they had over a million

15
00:00:39,659 --> 00:00:45,000
people but it all started about 45 years

16
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:48,269
ago in New York City and so we're

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,039
carrying on a tradition and I always

18
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:54,719
like to say you know we're all motivated

19
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:57,539
by cannabis cannabis is something that

20
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:00,870
adds to the quality of our life and that

21
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:03,890
we enjoy and it shouldn't be illegal

22
00:01:00,869 --> 00:01:07,319
even the current regulations are

23
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:09,868
over-regulation and so we have farther

24
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:12,658
to go it's good that some people are not

25
00:01:09,868 --> 00:01:15,739
going to jail for cannabis today and

26
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:18,930
some businesses are making money but

27
00:01:15,739 --> 00:01:21,118
everyone should benefit from this plant

28
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:24,000
we should be able to grow fields of it

29
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:26,368
for its seed without over-regulation and

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,849
that's the whole reason marijuana is

31
00:01:26,368 --> 00:01:32,938
illegal drugs have always just been a

32
00:01:29,849 --> 00:01:37,019
smokescreen it's always been about fuel

33
00:01:32,938 --> 00:01:39,328
and fiber and money and power and a

34
00:01:37,019 --> 00:01:41,969
continued centralization of economic and

35
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:44,819
political control so you know cannabis

36
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:48,509
is the oldest crop people began

37
00:01:44,819 --> 00:01:51,078
cultivating it at least 15,000 years ago

38
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:55,200
and maybe more than twice that long

39
00:01:51,078 --> 00:01:58,500
agriculture itself started because of

40
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:01,109
cannabis it's no other crop that we know

41
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:04,560
of today was being cultivated earlier

42
00:02:01,109 --> 00:02:06,930
than that and by 12,000 years ago its

43
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:10,370
cultivation spread from its indigenous

44
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:12,540
area up in the high Himalayas around

45
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:14,700
Afghanistan and Tibet

46
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:16,919
and cashmere it had already spread to

47
00:02:14,699 --> 00:02:20,608
the Mediterranean Basin and they were

48
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:24,688
cultivating it in modern-day Italy way

49
00:02:20,609 --> 00:02:27,390
before the Romans or even the Etruscans

50
00:02:24,688 --> 00:02:30,000
had a civilization cannabis was being

51
00:02:27,389 --> 00:02:31,798
cultivated there in present-day Italy

52
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,759
and all around the Mediterranean

53
00:02:31,799 --> 00:02:38,579
so our culture and civilization were

54
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:41,638
based on a cannabis culture and in fact

55
00:02:38,579 --> 00:02:44,250
we have co-evolved with cannabis over

56
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:46,950
the past twenty five thirty five

57
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:50,430
thousand years that we've made cannabis

58
00:02:46,949 --> 00:02:54,509
evolved for us and we have evolved for

59
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:57,750
cannabis where today the protein profile

60
00:02:54,509 --> 00:03:00,060
of hypsi perfectly matches humans

61
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:03,269
nutritional needs for protein and

62
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:05,878
exactly the right balance of amino acids

63
00:03:03,269 --> 00:03:09,509
the eight essential amino acids so the

64
00:03:05,878 --> 00:03:12,989
oil creates essential fatty acids

65
00:03:09,509 --> 00:03:14,759
it's mimics the endocannabinoid system

66
00:03:12,989 --> 00:03:19,199
there was just discovered here in the

67
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:21,239
past 25 years so this is the oldest crop

68
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:24,000
and it's the most productive you know

69
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:26,509
and the main reason it's illegal is

70
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,579
because the petrochemical pharmaceutical

71
00:03:26,509 --> 00:03:32,310
military industrial transnational

72
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:35,790
corporate elite fascist sons of a

73
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:38,519
[ __ ] in the ruling class gave us the

74
00:03:35,789 --> 00:03:41,689
lies the racist lies about cannabis

75
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:44,519
using a word from Mexican slang

76
00:03:41,689 --> 00:03:47,728
marijuana that was used here in the

77
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:50,129
Mexican revolutionary war over a hundred

78
00:03:47,729 --> 00:03:51,269
years ago they made it illegal if they

79
00:03:50,128 --> 00:03:52,858
had called it hemp

80
00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:54,689
they never would have made it illegal

81
00:03:52,859 --> 00:03:57,750
because everybody knew what hemp was

82
00:03:54,689 --> 00:04:00,030
it's only because they used this new

83
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:02,400
term and they claimed it was a deadly

84
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:05,370
new drug it's something that caused

85
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,799
people to go crazy and kill their family

86
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:10,139
and friends well we see that in a movie

87
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:11,969
reefer madness and marijuana assassin a

88
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:16,199
youth from back at those times but we

89
00:04:11,969 --> 00:04:20,399
know that was just malarkey and so this

90
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:22,199
is the safest therapeutically active

91
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:24,179
substance known to man according to

92
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:26,329
Francis Young an administrative law

93
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:28,009
judge for the United States Feder

94
00:04:26,329 --> 00:04:30,199
government back thirty years ago he's

95
00:04:28,009 --> 00:04:32,658
dead now but he said marijuana is the

96
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:34,908
safest therapeutically active substance

97
00:04:32,658 --> 00:04:38,120
known to man no one has ever died from

98
00:04:34,908 --> 00:04:40,668
marijuana so I'm glad you're out here to

99
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:42,590
March for cannabis thank you for turning

100
00:04:40,668 --> 00:04:47,769
out I'll be marching out there with you

101
00:04:42,589 --> 00:04:47,769
remember help us restore him
