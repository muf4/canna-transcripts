1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:08,639
President Obama famously said in 2012

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:11,009
after the Colorado and state of

3
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:13,230
Washington votes when asked you know

4
00:00:11,009 --> 00:00:18,118
were they going to interfere he said he

5
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:19,890
I figure fish to fry and has been quite

6
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:21,448
clear that there are other things with a

7
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:24,890
perfectly legal that are more

8
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:27,900
problematically interest the

9
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:31,740
clarification with Deputy Attorney

10
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:34,170
General Cole sending out parameters by

11
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:39,558
which the federal government is is going

12
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:43,460
to not fry those smaller fish

13
00:00:39,558 --> 00:00:47,549
unfortunately there are 93 US Attorney's

14
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:50,730
some of whom have been frightened small

15
00:00:47,549 --> 00:00:53,578
fish and we saw an outrageous case here

16
00:00:50,729 --> 00:00:55,799
in Oregon this summer where the US

17
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:59,640
Attorney's Office was going to prosecute

18
00:00:55,799 --> 00:01:02,819
and Native American teenager by all

19
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:04,618
accounts an exemplary young man for the

20
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:07,500
possession of the equivalent of

21
00:01:04,618 --> 00:01:09,390
marijuana cigarette which as you pointed

22
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:13,250
out introduction has been decriminalized

23
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:17,700
in Oregon since 1973 I mean it was just

24
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:20,640
stunning and several of the delegation

25
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:23,280
were inquiring as to what their

26
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,780
prosecutorial priorities are are there

27
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,950
not any drug kingpins organized crime

28
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:33,329
white-collar crime what the hell are you

29
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:36,570
doing and they ultimately dropped it but

30
00:01:33,328 --> 00:01:40,279
there is absolute schizophrenia with the

31
00:01:36,569 --> 00:01:45,149
DEA which is out of step with the

32
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:47,820
president and his pronouncements in fact

33
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:51,689
it took them until last year to actually

34
00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:56,179
acknowledge publicly that marijuana is

35
00:01:51,688 --> 00:01:58,929
not more dangerous than methamphetamines

36
00:01:56,180 --> 00:02:02,860
a stunning admission

37
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:05,920
on their part but you've you've seen

38
00:02:02,859 --> 00:02:08,679
maybe the weekend news and The

39
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:12,699
Washington Post to talked about the

40
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:16,930
failures of DEA to deal with the opioid

41
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:20,199
epidemic that is literally killing tens

42
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:23,610
of thousands of people in recent years I

43
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:27,729
think we're in a situation where

44
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:31,239
Secretary Clinton if she's elected will

45
00:02:27,729 --> 00:02:34,389
build on that I think she is quite open

46
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:36,099
to dealing with fixing that the two big

47
00:02:34,389 --> 00:02:38,379
problems that the industry has in terms

48
00:02:36,099 --> 00:02:41,349
of taxation and in terms of banking and

49
00:02:38,379 --> 00:02:49,479
allowing the states to go their separate

50
00:02:41,349 --> 00:02:51,549
ways I am optimistic that Congress will

51
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:54,819
make the job easier but i think a

52
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:56,709
clinton administration will build on the

53
00:02:54,819 --> 00:03:00,759
foundation perhaps move it a little

54
00:02:56,709 --> 00:03:04,539
further and in trouble i don't know i

55
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:08,120
mean this is a man who doesn't agree

56
00:03:04,539 --> 00:03:11,539
with himself alibi out

57
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:13,819
and as God is my witness I i if he said

58
00:03:11,539 --> 00:03:15,769
that he was either going to prosecute to

59
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:18,500
legalize we don't know that he would say

60
00:03:15,769 --> 00:03:21,890
the next day and he doesn't know what

61
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:23,539
he'd said interesting but mercifully I

62
00:03:21,889 --> 00:03:26,268
think we will be spared the specter of

63
00:03:23,539 --> 00:03:28,340
him trying to figure out what his

64
00:03:26,269 --> 00:03:31,090
beliefs are that he would inflict on the

65
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:35,439
American public at least through

66
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:35,439
government will still have any quick

67
00:03:39,939 --> 00:03:47,810
turn off the television shut down the

68
00:03:43,729 --> 00:03:49,159
computer or hold the newspaper don't

69
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:51,310
hold the newspaper getting to the

70
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:54,150
newspaper turn off those other sources

71
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:57,599
will stop covering

72
00:03:54,150 --> 00:04:00,800
[Music]

73
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,799
