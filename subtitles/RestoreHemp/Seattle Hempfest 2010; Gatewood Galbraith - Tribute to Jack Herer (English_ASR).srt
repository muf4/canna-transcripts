Nation he is a grand champion of we the

23
00:00:56,359 --> 00:01:01,679
people and the natural cycle in our

24
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:03,839
battle with the synthetic subversion

25
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:06,118
which threatens the very concept of the

26
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,920
sovereignty of each human

27
00:01:06,118 --> 00:01:11,239
individual Jack's tireless efforts to

28
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:13,759
eliminate the facts about cannabis had

29
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:15,560
furnished Freedom Fighters everywhere

30
00:01:13,759 --> 00:01:18,118
with the tools of knowledge with which

31
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:20,920
to resist the fascism of the corporate

32
00:01:18,118 --> 00:01:24,118
State as it seeks to subject everyone to

33
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:27,719
its economic bottom

34
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:30,519
line Jack recognized that cannabis is a

35
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:32,719
dateway to existentialism which

36
00:01:30,519 --> 00:01:35,959
enlightens our existence and is the

37
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:39,000
basis of our freedom of choice he also

38
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:41,280
recognized the miraculous healing powers

39
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,640
of this herb and many sick and dying

40
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,200
people have found comfort in its use

41
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:48,118
after reading his wonderful Manifesto

42
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,840
the emperor wears no

43
00:01:48,118 --> 00:01:54,159
clothes I am one of

44
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:56,520
them Jack ha's Grand Spirit may have

45
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,640
left his worn out body but he has

46
00:01:56,519 --> 00:02:00,519
entered into the hearts and minds of

47
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,840
millions of us who will will forever be

48
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:05,199
grateful to have been educated by his

49
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:07,600
commitment to the truth God bless you

50
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,600
jack

51
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:14,598
ha brother the message that Jack and I

52
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:17,079
have is that your younger generation are

53
00:02:14,598 --> 00:02:19,598
open to perils to which he and I never

54
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:22,000
had to conceive that there is a great

55
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:24,878
move of foot to take you out of the

56
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,318
property of sovereign human being and

57
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:32,159
put you into the property of the man the

58
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:34,560
man the chemal pharmaceutical military

59
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:38,039
industrial transational corporate

60
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,039
fascist Elite son of a

61
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:43,800
[Â __Â ] we see the Constitution and the

62
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:46,000
Bill of Rights as impediments to the

63
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:49,040
implementation of their new world order

64
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,120
and global economy and they are not warm

65
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:52,359
and fuzzy about you or me or our

66
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,959
children or

67
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:56,879
grandchildren and they they are afraid

68
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:00,000
to give everybody in the rest of the

69
00:02:56,878 --> 00:03:02,039
world due process and Constitution to

70
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,759
right so in order to make it one world

71
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:06,639
they're going to take ours

72
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:09,280
away and the question of him the

73
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:11,679
question of cannabis is the most Vivid

74
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,840
illustration of how this government has

75
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,560
overstepped its bounds in policing the

76
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:19,000
private behavior of citizens when they

77
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,319
told us we couldn't plant a hip seed in

78
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,158
the ground they severed us from the

79
00:03:21,318 --> 00:03:27,479
natural cycle that is what they seek to

80
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:29,199
do I call it the synthetic subversion

81
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:31,438
where they want to replace all the

82
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:33,518
natural products on Earth that used to

83
00:03:31,438 --> 00:03:36,959
be grown out of God's Earth and God's

84
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:39,200
seed and replace them with synthetic

85
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:41,719
products and knocked our farmer out of

86
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:44,878
the agrarian society and The Agrarian

87
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:47,080
market and made the ghost towns of our

88
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:50,039
small cities and Villages across this

89
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:52,480
country we need to ReDiscover a cast

90
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:55,000
crop one that will allow our Farmers to

91
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:57,359
go back to the land one that will allow

92
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:01,479
our Farmers to compete with the petrol

93
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:03,920
chemical pipelines you plant us 7%

94
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:06,798
agricultural land in him you would have

95
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:09,438
to import another drop of oil we can

96
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:12,680
replace the spills in the Gulf we can

97
00:04:09,438 --> 00:04:14,759
replace the uh environmental catastrophe

98
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,918
that the petroleum pipelines have cast

99
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:20,199
upon Mother Earth and instead let our

100
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:23,159
Farmers grow hemp as a fuel crop finally

101
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:25,600
in 1991 Willie Nelson and I poured hemp

102
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:28,360
B into my Mercedes diesel and drove it

103
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:31,039
across Kentucky in my bid for governor

104
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:34,560
that's why he started his b fuel plan

105
00:04:31,038 --> 00:04:38,719
listen folks you all have been handed a

106
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:41,839
