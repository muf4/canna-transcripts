1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:05,679
well I want to pick up a little bit on

2
00:00:03,319 --> 00:00:07,720
what Chris started with and that's about

3
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:10,558
the institution of media and the

4
00:00:07,719 --> 00:00:12,320
function it serves in society and then

5
00:00:10,558 --> 00:00:14,518
from there I want to talk about a few

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:18,118
stories because the that's the frame in

7
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:19,960
which media operates so so there's a

8
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:22,559
there's a there's no question that there

9
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:24,719
are people who lie as Chris pointed out

10
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:26,839
and what you have with journalism is an

11
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:29,559
institution that has a core value of a

12
00:00:26,839 --> 00:00:31,599
commitment to truth and it's the pursuit

13
00:00:29,559 --> 00:00:34,320
of the TR truth and the inquiry into the

14
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:38,079
truth so with the story it's who what

15
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:40,878
where when why it's specific information

16
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:43,039
it can be tested it can be questioned it

17
00:00:40,878 --> 00:00:45,280
can be verified and it can be proved

18
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:47,840
because it is the written word and so

19
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,039
there is a reference that can be looked

20
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:53,399
back to so in some ways it's similar to

21
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:57,439
law and policy which work in a very

22
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:59,120
specific written uh area of operation

23
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:01,119
and so what happens is if there are

24
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:02,759
Publications that are not telling the

25
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:05,478
truth and there is evidence to the

26
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:07,840
contrary their other the institution

27
00:01:05,478 --> 00:01:10,158
itself will critique and check and they

28
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,960
will lose credibility and they will lose

29
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:15,280
legitimacy and it is those news

30
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:17,919
organizations that are bringing valuable

31
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:20,040
information and telling the truth that

32
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,000
are actually raising everybody's

33
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:25,439
Consciousness so that's sort of a

34
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,400
baseline within journalism but once you

35
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:31,118
have that there's still a question of

36
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:33,520
what is going to become a story so I get

37
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:36,599
I live in Los Angeles uh I get the Los

38
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:39,519
Angeles Times and I swear it seems like

39
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:42,438
every week There's a story about how the

40
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:46,478
national forests are an environmental

41
00:01:42,438 --> 00:01:48,718
disaster Zone because of all these drugs

42
00:01:46,478 --> 00:01:51,158
and this essentially what's happened is

43
00:01:48,718 --> 00:01:52,798
because of asset forfeiture the grows

44
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:55,280
have moved into the national forests

45
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:58,719
where no property can be seized they're

46
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,799
often run by Mexican gangs and they're

47
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:02,118
you know they're armed not taking care

48
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,840
of the environment yes it is an

49
00:02:02,118 --> 00:02:07,000
environmental harm but the story is

50
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,319
never about why we have illegal grow

51
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,919
operations it's just this assumption at

52
00:02:09,318 --> 00:02:13,039
least in Los Angeles where there's this

53
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:15,439
Eco Consciousness that it's it's just an

54
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:17,479
environmental story and then you move

55
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:19,800
along and the next week There's a story

56
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:23,039
about uh the violence in Mexico and how

57
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:25,319
this is all caused by the drugs and no

58
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:28,120
there isn't this this recognition that

59
00:02:25,318 --> 00:02:30,799
the story maybe about the drug

60
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:32,759
prohibition has exported this violence

61
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,439
across the border and that they there

62
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:38,199
are no secure property rights for people

63
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:40,639
who are Trucking in drugs and therefore

64
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:42,439
the only way that they can secure their

65
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:44,958
what's theirs is is with violence

66
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:47,000
because they have no legal protection so

67
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:49,280
there there's there there is discretion

68
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,800
within journalism about the way that you

69
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,479
are going to tell the story and then

70
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:56,680
also further there are questions about

71
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:58,719
what media is doing they want to tell a

72
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:01,400
story that people are going to be

73
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:04,680
interested in so I wanted to pick three

74
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:07,920
stories that uh that in my experience in

75
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:10,719
drug policy were became very big stories

76
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:14,039
and a little bit about why those things

77
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:16,919
seem to happen the way that they did so

78
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:18,719
the first one is uh rewind a couple of

79
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:22,000
years we were we work with the

80
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:24,799
Entertainer Drew Kerry at the reason

81
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,519
foundation and he we we launched a video

82
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:29,080
journalism project working with Drew and

83
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,200
one of the initial videos that we

84
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:33,760
released was on medical marijuana in

85
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:37,119
California with Drew krey as the

86
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:39,878
host well this we released the video the

87
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:44,280
week that he became the new host of the

88
00:03:39,878 --> 00:03:46,919
prices right and the this story got

89
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:49,080
picked up by the Associated Press and

90
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:51,000
multiple news channels and it was

91
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:53,400
printed in local papers pretty much all

92
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,360
over the country because here's the

93
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:59,959
prices right which is daytime TV

94
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,799
America and what makes it an interesting

95
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:05,158
story is the host is talking about

96
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:07,400
marijuana this subject that nobody else

97
00:04:05,158 --> 00:04:09,759
can talk about and so the the

98
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:11,438
combination of things made it surprising

99
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:14,479
made it more interesting and as we would

100
00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:16,639
say it made the story blow up because we

101
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:17,959
we're generating stories all of the time

102
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,918
we don't know which ones are going to

103
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:21,879
become hits which are the ones that are

104
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:23,599
going to spread like wildfire because

105
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:26,040
more people are interesting in hearing

106
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,280
those stories the Second Story I wanted

107
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:30,560
to talk about that that actually blew up

108
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:33,079
was the case of a dispens operator in

109
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,360
California named Charlie Lynch uh

110
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:37,478
Charles if you've met the guy or you

111
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,240
know the guy he's like a choir

112
00:04:37,478 --> 00:04:43,319
boy uh

113
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,960
softspoken upstanding before he opened

114
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:48,680
his Collective he called the DEA to ask

115
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:51,198
for guidance about how to open a

116
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:54,038
dispensary in accord with state law he

117
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:56,160
contacted the city council the mayor of

118
00:04:54,038 --> 00:04:58,639
San Louis abiso attended the ribbon

119
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,240
cutting for the dispensary the president

120
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:03,600
of the Chamber of Comm

121
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:06,240
so he was very a very stable Citizen and

122
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:09,039
very conscientious about his community

123
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:12,038
so when the conflict happened and the

124
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:14,319
raid came and he was facing federal

125
00:05:12,038 --> 00:05:15,918
charges essentially if that all if

126
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:17,439
convicted on all counts he had the

127
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:18,560
potential to have have what would have

128
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:21,439
been a life

129
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,439
sentence this became a significant story

130
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:25,839
because it captured this that Charlie

131
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:29,079
Lynch because of who he is and how he

132
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:31,560
worked was a sympathetic victim of the

133
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:34,000
state and so that story it became a

134
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:35,600
bigger story because of that and because

135
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,478
he had done the things with the Chamber

136
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,120
of Commerce and the mayor these are

137
00:05:37,478 --> 00:05:42,879
things that make people go wait a second

138
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:45,478
that seems wrong and so the story has

139
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:47,959
more impact that way and the story then

140
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:50,439
got picked up by Al Roker picked up by

141
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:52,959
others and part of that was just because

142
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:55,199
of the news cycle and Charlie's trial by

143
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:57,638
the time it was all finished he was

144
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,720
found guilty of the charges that were

145
00:05:57,639 --> 00:06:03,240
placed against him but then when the

146
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:06,000
judge came to do sentencing he said look

147
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:08,519
this guy operated in good faith he made

148
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,519
these efforts and his sentence is going

149
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:13,399
to be three he gave him he didn't even

150
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:15,758
give him the mandatory minimum sentences

151
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:18,399
he gave him one year and one day for the

152
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:21,038
three guilty convictions far better

153
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:23,839
outcome than was when than was expected

154
00:06:21,038 --> 00:06:26,038
when this all began the most recent

155
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:28,959
story that we were around that just blew

156
00:06:26,038 --> 00:06:30,399
up was a story about a drug raid in

157
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:32,799
Colombia

158
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:36,038
Missouri I I don't know if you've seen

159
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,960
this video on YouTube but uh it's it's

160
00:06:36,038 --> 00:06:39,360
from the perspective of the Columbia

161
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:41,879
Missouri police department and they

162
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,879
began just filming what was a standard

163
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:48,159
practice SWAT raid on a home and it's at

164
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:50,399
night the police go in it turns out a

165
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:54,759
family lives there a husband wife

166
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:57,679
7-year-old kid dog and it's they asleep

167
00:06:54,759 --> 00:07:01,038
so they break down the doors it's all

168
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:03,439
per procedure they shoot the dog the

169
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:06,959
with the kid there the the dad's like

170
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:09,240
what's going on they found I mean like

171
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:11,079
they found a very small amount of

172
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:13,280
marijuana it was like nothing was even

173
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:15,159
in the they didn't even find anything so

174
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:18,000
they're going in with guns blazing with

175
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:20,759
a family there and and I really and the

176
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,759
video it blew up it's up to one it was

177
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:25,960
like at 1.3 million views on YouTube in

178
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:29,759
the space of a few short weeks because

179
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:31,719
it shows so clearly what is going going

180
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:34,400
on and no procedures were were were

181
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:36,560
violated this was by the book and but it

182
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:38,159
caused the police chief of the town to

183
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,360
change the way they're going to operate

184
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,720
going forward he said I hate the

185
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:44,759
internet because the transparency that

186
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:48,080
the that the news media provided in this

187
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:50,360
case showed what is the problem there

188
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:52,000
was no need there was a time delay

189
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:54,280
between when they got the warrant and

190
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,319
when they conducted The Raid it wasn't a

191
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:58,439
high stakes high speed we' got to get

192
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,598
there fast they could have gone at any

193
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:03,199
time of day and in fact they could have

194
00:08:00,598 --> 00:08:05,279
just knocked on the front door uh as I

195
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:07,879
was talking with Neil Franklin the new

196
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:10,918
head of leap and he said you know I was

197
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:12,919
I was in drug prohibition but from the

198
00:08:10,918 --> 00:08:15,158
police side he's like you can't flush

199
00:08:12,918 --> 00:08:17,120
that much pot down a toilet that fast if

200
00:08:15,158 --> 00:08:19,439
you know if you have the warrant and you

201
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,439
just show up at the door so so these

202
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:24,839
were three stories that went big but it

203
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:27,279
was because they were individual people

204
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:29,638
and you could see the the victimization

205
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:31,959
or you could see what makes it an

206
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:34,080
interesting story and and as somebody in

207
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:37,240
media that's what we are always looking

208
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:40,000
for is the interesting story that is

209
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:43,599
true that conveys information in a new

210
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,159
way for people so with that I'll I'll

211
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:48,160
say

212
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:48,159
thanks
