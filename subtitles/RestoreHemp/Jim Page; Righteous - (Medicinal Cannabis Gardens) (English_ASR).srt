it's Nature's a wonderful weed been

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,800

me history's locked in a cardboard box

15
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:47,280
and it's hard to take a look with

16
00:00:45,159 --> 00:00:49,799
Sidetrack Thrills and Fantasies all

17

tells you what to think and they've got

19
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,359
their reasons why you got to pick

20
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:58,039
reality up by the scru of the neck and

21
00:00:55,359 --> 00:01:01,840
look it right in the eye and isn't that

22
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:04,159
R isn't that good enough

23
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,200

enough righteous is good enough for me

27
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:16,560
now the same people that are spreading

28
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:18,560
the fear the same people that scare me

29
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,040
the most you know some of them look like

30
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,600
they just ass soon like they hanging

31
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,719
from a lamp post they talk about what it

32
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:27,719
does to your brain well I just have to

33
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:31,560
react cuz Hitler never touch this stuff

34
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:33,399
and that's an actual fact it isn't that

35
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:36,680
isn't that good

36
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:41,478
enough ain't that the way it to

37
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:45,520
be is that rightous and is that good

38
00:01:41,478 --> 00:01:47,438
enough righteous is good enough for me

39
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:49,759
George Washington was a father of our

40
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:52,199
country and he had a hemp Plantation

41
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:54,560
Betsy Ross used it to make the flag that

42
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,520
flew about the baby Nation they wrote

43
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,320
their declarations on paper from that

44
00:01:56,519 --> 00:02:00,158
same hemp fiber press and I don't know

45
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:02,158
what they spoke when they were taking a

46
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:03,240
break but I got a pretty good guess and

47
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,039
isn't

48
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:09,280
that isn't that good

49
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:11,318
enough ain't that the way ought to

50
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,080
be is that

51
00:02:11,318 --> 00:02:19,839
right is that good

52
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:19,840
enough rightous is good enough for me

54
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,400
it'll calm you down when you're too

55
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,519
uptight to just might make you smile use

56
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:00,080
the seed oil in your engine it'll

57
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:02,360
lubricate the miles glaucoma

58
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,920
chemotherapy they say it smooth out the

59
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:06,760
track so next time you meet a cancer

60
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:08,238
patient ask him what they think about

61
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:11,000
that isn't that

62
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:14,239
right isn't that good

63
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,158
enough ain't that the way it ought to

64
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:19,080
be isn't

65
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:22,959
that and is that good

66
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:25,120
enough righteous is good enough for me I

67
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:27,360
don't know why some people get so upset

68
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,319
when you say to legalize it they'd

69
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,840
rather build more jails arrest more

70
00:03:29,318 --> 00:03:33,919
people spread more crazy lies it's like

71
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,759
talking to a brick wall you know they

72
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:37,878
just don't get the facts I think they

73
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:40,560
ought to try a little that Betsy Ross so

74
00:03:37,878 --> 00:03:43,359
just to help him relax and isn't

75
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:46,598
that is that good

76
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:50,159
enough ain't that the way it to

77
00:03:46,598 --> 00:03:51,399
be isn't that righteous and isn't that

78
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:54,878
good

79
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:57,920
enough righteous is good enough for

80
00:03:54,878 --> 00:04:00,158
me so I'll be on my way now guess I've

81
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:01,719
taken just about enough of your time I

82
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:04,399
know there's a lot of people out there

83
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:06,680
that don't like my state of mind but I

84
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,079
got mine and you got yours we give what

85
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,840
we can take so next time I need a

86
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:12,959
breather well I might just take a little

87
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:15,759
smoke break and isn't that

88
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:19,079
R isn't that good

89
00:04:15,758 --> 00:04:21,079
enough ain't that the way it ought to

90
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:23,800
be is

91
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:28,079
that is that good

92
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:30,199
enough righteous is good enough for me

93
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:31,959
Isn't that righteous

94
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:35,240
isn't that good

95
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:37,319
