1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,860
you got your PhD from the University of

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,318
Oregon Medical School which is now known

3
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:09,300
as Oregon Health Sciences University and

4
00:00:07,318 --> 00:00:13,080
while you were there I know you told me

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:17,278
the story about finding huge gallon jars

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:19,560
of cannabis in the uh cupboard yes when

7
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:22,920
I when I started as a grad student at

8
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:24,719
the medical school the Dr David the

9
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,460
chairman of pharmacology says Levesque

10
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:28,919
I'd like you to go in and straighten out

11
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:31,199
the stock room

12
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,939
um whatever just straighten it out and

13
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:36,539
the first thing I found was a gallon jug

14
00:00:32,939 --> 00:00:40,259
of cannabis cough medicine and at that

15
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:43,079
time it was illegal for cannabis any of

16
00:00:40,259 --> 00:00:44,659
any sort to be anywhere and this was 13

17
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:48,420
years after

18
00:00:44,659 --> 00:00:51,779
1937 or so something like that and and

19
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:54,179
it was manufactured by Park Davis and so

20
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:56,399
I said well if Park Davis paid me to go

21
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:58,198
to medical school so I said if Park

22
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,120
Davis says this stuff is good for cough

23
00:00:58,198 --> 00:01:02,820
medicine it must be good so I poured

24
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:04,500
myself a pint of it like this and it's

25
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:07,319
probably out in my barn someplace and

26
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:09,180
it's probably still good all right all

27
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:11,519
right that's a great story we had this

28
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:14,460
is an Eli Lilly container we're going to

29
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:17,879

00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:03,259

legal in Switzerland from uh

44
00:02:03,259 --> 00:02:09,419

00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:27,900
dollars to defeat it that's in a country

51
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:29,639
of 4 million Swiss voters so our federal

52
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:31,980

53
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:33,779

Philadelphia Pennsylvania right next

63
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:06,560

64
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:12,120

68
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:26,060
European languages right next door we

69
00:03:22,378 --> 00:03:28,620
have a uh what is this this is the

70
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:31,140
glycera phosphates compound with

71
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:33,180

00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:39,900
ingredient is cannabis Indica nice nice

74
00:03:37,378 --> 00:03:41,878

there's one still in the box that's

76
00:03:41,878 --> 00:03:45,239
unopened and I'm not going to open that

77
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,680
because it's a lot more valuable and

78
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:49,500
this one just has some residue inside

79
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:52,860
this is the Lloyd Brothers cannabis

80
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:55,680
extract so that's uh another Nifty thing

81
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:59,640
that shows its medical utility and last

82
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:02,819

compounds uh including powdered hashish

86
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:13,979

87
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:18,660
then they mixed it just like this other

88
00:04:13,979 --> 00:04:20,279
one the glass so phosphate nerving they

89
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:22,740
mixed it with several other things so it

90
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:25,019
wasn't uncommon to find these nerve

91
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:29,478
potions that included cannabis and so

92
00:04:25,019 --> 00:04:29,478
