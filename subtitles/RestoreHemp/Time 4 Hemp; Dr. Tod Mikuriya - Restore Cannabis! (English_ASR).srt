proposition P this man's background goes

26
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:04,079
beyond that but for now that basically

27
00:01:01,948 --> 00:01:07,259
covers the things that we're going to be

28
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:09,810
approaching now proposition P a lot of

29
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:11,700
people have become aware of that through

30
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:13,650
the press and the media coverage and I

31
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,240
know people becoming aware your

32
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:18,359
background recognizes that you have a

33
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:20,039
lot going for you intellectually and so

34
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:22,680
that when you make a comment that we

35
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:25,380
should pay attention to him as a medical

36
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:27,630
resource for the curing of pain and

37
00:01:25,379 --> 00:01:31,078
relieving of pain and other diseases it

38
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:35,269
comes with a lot of impact well thank

39
00:01:31,078 --> 00:01:35,269
you very much it's a pleasure to be here

40
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:40,949
one of the problems that we had what

41
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:43,879
we've been having problems for many

42
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:48,780
years of getting access to medicinal

43
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:51,089
cannabis and once upon a time I was in

44
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:52,700
charge of the marijuana research for the

45
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:57,630
National Institute of Mental Health in

46
00:01:52,700 --> 00:02:02,159
Chevy Chase this is back in 1967 but

47
00:01:57,629 --> 00:02:06,560
since that time there's been a minimal

48
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:09,300
amount of progress in getting cannabis

49
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,729
available for medicinal use

50
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:15,330
only recently has there been some

51
00:02:11,729 --> 00:02:17,579
compassionate access and only recently

52
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:19,980
have there been some grudging admissions

53
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:22,890
by the scientific and medical

54
00:02:19,979 --> 00:02:27,389
establishment that cannabis in fact had

55
00:02:22,889 --> 00:02:29,909
therapeutic efficacy okay and I feel

56
00:02:27,389 --> 00:02:33,889
very bitter about this because I know it

57
00:02:29,909 --> 00:02:37,409
to be a cover-up since before marijuana

58
00:02:33,889 --> 00:02:41,939
was taken away from availability by the

59
00:02:37,409 --> 00:02:45,990
1937 Tax Act medicinal cannabis also

60
00:02:41,939 --> 00:02:49,560
became unavailable deleted from the 1941

61
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:51,360
formulary and pharmacopoeia now why did

62
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:54,330
that go hand in hand like that because

63
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,520
it was part of this so-called send them

64
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:59,520
a signal school of propaganda and

65
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:01,700
disinformation that the police had to

66
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:04,920
maintain in order to continue the

67
00:03:01,699 --> 00:03:07,289
fictionalized killer weed or part of

68
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:09,149
reefer madness and so saying that that

69
00:03:07,289 --> 00:03:12,560
cannabis had medical or medicinal

70
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:15,330
utility would have run contrary to their

71
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:18,300
fiction that they needed to maintain in

72
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:21,600
order to continue credibility and not

73
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:23,810
having people question why marijuana was

74
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:26,729
in fact prohibited now that's the only

75
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:28,439
plant substance drug which is not really

76
00:03:26,729 --> 00:03:30,569
a dredged sinner that's been treated

77
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:32,849
like that I mean we have opium is still

78
00:03:30,569 --> 00:03:35,189
available cetera for medicinal purposes

79
00:03:32,849 --> 00:03:40,639
etc don't we and other forms of that's

80
00:03:35,189 --> 00:03:44,329
what even cocaine but because of the

81
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:46,319
several factors the growing popularity

82
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:49,310
popularity and the promotion of

83
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:53,849
synthetic drugs by the pharmaceutical

84
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:58,800
manufacturers that started in the 1890s

85
00:03:53,849 --> 00:04:01,620
and went on through the 1900s and has

86
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:05,570
escalated ever since with a new and

87
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:08,909
better allegedly of synthetic substances

88
00:04:05,569 --> 00:04:11,280
no money could be made many patents and

89
00:04:08,909 --> 00:04:13,979
they weren't interested in promoting the

90
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,500
use of cannabis although Eli Lilly &amp;

91
00:04:13,979 --> 00:04:18,279
Parke Davis

92
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:20,290
contained a farm for developing

93
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:22,939
pharmaceutical strains and

94
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:26,600
pharmaceutical strength plants up until

95
00:04:22,939 --> 00:04:29,000
1937 hmm and then they're just not

96
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,290
disregarding all that path past evidence

97
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,160
until now you're bringing it to life

98
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:36,230
well yes and that's well it's very much

99
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:39,050
like living at least in the medical

100
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:40,670
world with a depiction of the Planet of

101
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:43,939
the Apes and what happened to medicine

102
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:46,430
after they wanted to get rid of all

103
00:04:43,939 --> 00:04:48,860
these human kinds of advances in

104
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:50,300
technology and they reverted to some

105
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:51,500
form of medicine that resembled

106
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:54,139
something that happened in the Middle

107
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:56,120
Ages or worse okay well now see people

108
00:04:54,139 --> 00:04:58,279
are able to recognize that him can be

109
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:00,139
made into paper fiber and fuel but when

110
00:04:58,279 --> 00:05:02,750
it comes with the idea of being medicine

111
00:05:00,139 --> 00:05:05,300
outside of smoking it as far as relaxing

112
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:07,668
taking care of stress etc it's hard for

113
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:09,379
them to imagine in what areas hemp can

114
00:05:07,668 --> 00:05:11,899
actually be utilized for now you say

115
00:05:09,379 --> 00:05:13,879
that it helps in aids as an example well

116
00:05:11,899 --> 00:05:16,310
okay back to this issue of censorship

117
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:20,569
and it's being swept under the rug okay

118
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:23,660
and the importance of bringing this back

119
00:05:20,569 --> 00:05:25,399
to consciousness and bringing it back to

120
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:28,550
the awareness of the medical community

121
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:32,750
as far as a therapeutic agent and that's

122
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:35,150
why the text of the initiative or the

123
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:40,100
proposition in San Francisco that I

124
00:05:35,149 --> 00:05:43,129
co-authored contained the term restore

125
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:45,850
could you take the moment and read it to

126
00:05:43,129 --> 00:05:48,350
our audience yes I appreciate that

127

and then now we're trying to figure out

170
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:03,310
what do we do now all of a sudden we

171
00:08:01,149 --> 00:08:06,549
become successes after all these many

172
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:10,589
years having been failures and looked

173
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:13,210
upon as outcasts deviants nuts

174
00:08:10,589 --> 00:08:15,250
irresponsible love dope smoking hippies

175
00:08:13,209 --> 00:08:18,310
and other kinds of negative stereotypes

176
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:23,350
that we've been stuck with which is all

177
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:26,500
part of the suppression campaign to keep

178
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:28,090
a cannabis marijuana or hemp illegal I

179
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,920
see a lotta has to do with people of

180
00:08:28,089 --> 00:08:32,110
your stature being willing to come forth

181
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:33,430
into the public light and make these

182
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:35,680
statements because you know you leave

183
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:38,649
yourself wide open I'm certain you

184
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:41,438
realize that for a variety of tax

185
00:08:38,649 --> 00:08:46,058
be from government agencies or private

186
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:49,948
industry yes because it's really part of

187
00:08:46,058 --> 00:08:53,139
a campaign to maintain these collective

188
00:08:49,948 --> 00:08:56,229
fictions in order to prop up these

189
00:08:53,139 --> 00:09:00,159
flawed policies that they need to

190
00:08:56,230 --> 00:09:03,879
attempt to discredit or tarnish or kill

191
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:07,360
the messenger somehow so as to not be

192
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:09,819
made to confront the actual facts and

193
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:12,610
deal on a level playing field with what

194
00:09:09,818 --> 00:09:13,838
is in fact happening when we come back I

195
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:16,889
like to be able to go a little bit

196
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:19,569
farther as to how the next step

197
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:23,230
appropriate prep proposition P

198
00:09:19,568 --> 00:09:26,198
preparation preparation a helps take

199
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:27,879
care of a pain yes it does it's going to

200
00:09:26,198 --> 00:09:29,139
be implemented in the direction that is

201
00:09:27,879 --> 00:09:31,269
going to have to go before it becomes

202
00:09:29,139 --> 00:09:34,959
completely successful we'll be right

203
00:09:31,269 --> 00:09:37,919
back after this we're talking today with

204
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:40,479
dr. Todd materia and we are learning

205
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:42,849
some of the benefits of course for the

206
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:46,120
medical uses of the hemp plant but now

207
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:48,220
we also have some challenges against us

208
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:50,709
still that we've got to ever come you

209
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:52,240
have n cumbered the first leg of the

210
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:54,188
journey chief just the first battle

211
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,799
basically you've got it legal in a city

212
00:09:54,188 --> 00:09:58,480
but now I understand from talking to

213
00:09:56,799 --> 00:10:00,519
Dennis Peron another's you still have to

214
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:04,089
encumber the state laws and the federal

215
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:06,428
laws now how do you plan on taking

216
00:10:04,089 --> 00:10:09,939
getting this into the next phase I've

217
00:10:06,428 --> 00:10:12,519
already worked on attempting to surf on

218
00:10:09,938 --> 00:10:15,610
this event wave and have taken a running

219
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:18,428
start by contacting the California

220
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:21,818
Medical Association with regard to the

221
00:10:18,428 --> 00:10:25,870
possible passage of this before it

222
00:10:21,818 --> 00:10:28,298
actually passed and so I'm asking them

223
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:33,209
to become involved with helping to

224
00:10:28,298 --> 00:10:37,110
implement implement the intent of the

225
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:39,308
proposition which specifies that the

226
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:40,990
people of the City and County of San

227
00:10:39,308 --> 00:10:42,909
Francisco recommend that the state of

228
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:45,600
California and the California Medical

229
00:10:42,909 --> 00:10:47,490
Association restore had preparation

230
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,220
etc how do you think that will be met

231
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:52,230
with trepidation by the California

232
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:54,360
Medical Association but it's been put on

233
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:57,569
a fast track to be reviewed by their

234
00:10:54,360 --> 00:11:01,490
scientific council and I spoke with the

235
00:10:57,568 --> 00:11:04,439
president of the CMA dr. Howard Lang who

236
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:07,500
impresses me as a forthright courageous

237
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:09,329
person but I don't know how he feels on

238
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:12,299
the issue he was vaguely aware of having

239
00:11:09,328 --> 00:11:14,309
seen it across his desk but then passed

240
00:11:12,299 --> 00:11:16,049
it on to the appropriate staffers down

241
00:11:14,309 --> 00:11:20,789
at their headquarters office in San

242
00:11:16,049 --> 00:11:23,399
Francisco and they were aware that it

243
00:11:20,789 --> 00:11:25,318
had passed but we're not aware of how

244
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:29,039
the California Medical Association was

245
00:11:25,318 --> 00:11:31,649
obliged to be involved there isn't any

246
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:34,909
kind of way we can force the CMA to be

247
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:39,480
involved in taking a stand yay or nay

248
00:11:34,909 --> 00:11:44,278
but if they do support this they're the

249
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:47,310
options of activity are to publicize it

250
00:11:44,278 --> 00:11:50,188
amongst their physicians and also start

251
00:11:47,309 --> 00:11:52,828
working in Sacramento for legislation to

252
00:11:50,188 --> 00:11:56,278
make this possible and of course

253
00:11:52,828 --> 00:11:59,729
statewide okay now is there a chance

254
00:11:56,278 --> 00:12:02,009
that a federal agent or estate agent

255
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:04,709
would still take action in the city of

256
00:12:02,009 --> 00:12:06,389
San Francisco and began arresting people

257
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:08,938
when they are growing marijuana hemp

258
00:12:06,389 --> 00:12:10,589
well this is always possible but we have

259
00:12:08,938 --> 00:12:15,539
this unique situation in San Francisco

260
00:12:10,589 --> 00:12:17,699
where the district attorney has assured

261
00:12:15,539 --> 00:12:20,039
us that he will not prosecute any cases

262
00:12:17,698 --> 00:12:22,649
for six plants or less that are growing

263
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:25,438
for medicinal purposes if the person

264
00:12:22,649 --> 00:12:28,250
demonstrates that they are that they

265
00:12:25,438 --> 00:12:30,719
have medicinal intent or documentation

266
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:32,879
Gatewood Galbraith once made the comment

267
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,680
on a show of ours that if he were able

268
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:36,389
to real Eagle eyes Hampton Kentucky all

269
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:39,388
the tourists become any fill up all the

270
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:40,740
hotels when I spoke with Dennis Peron he

271
00:12:39,389 --> 00:12:43,198
made comment that now that this has

272
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:45,329
happened in the medical field variety of

273
00:12:43,198 --> 00:12:47,938
organizations from muscular cirrhosis

274
00:12:45,328 --> 00:12:50,399
etc are awaiting to open up foundations

275
00:12:47,938 --> 00:12:52,889
and officers etc in the San Francisco ie

276
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:54,600
bay area do you foresee that happening

277
00:12:52,889 --> 00:12:56,818
and if so is that going to make the

278
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:59,579
movement stronger

279
00:12:56,818 --> 00:13:02,368
I hadn't thought of that eventualities

280
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:05,338
essa Sara Lee but I would welcome that

281
00:13:02,369 --> 00:13:07,829
because it would with what we have in

282
00:13:05,339 --> 00:13:11,009
mind help everybody including the

283
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:12,318
sufferers that were in need because now

284
00:13:11,009 --> 00:13:14,428
that we have the de facto

285
00:13:12,318 --> 00:13:17,928
decriminalization even though the state

286
00:13:14,428 --> 00:13:20,850
attorney general is the right-wing

287
00:13:17,928 --> 00:13:25,438
individual that will probably oppose

288
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:28,139
this and ironically he was the opponent

289
00:13:25,438 --> 00:13:30,328
to the DA who lost the race for the

290
00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:33,889
state attorney general to him so there

291
00:13:30,328 --> 00:13:33,888
won't be any love lost between them

292
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:39,720
theoretically the state attorney general

293
00:13:38,068 --> 00:13:43,168
could send state police and state

294
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:45,209
narcotics agents to go and do this kind

295
00:13:43,168 --> 00:13:49,850
of enforcement but it would be a

296
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:52,708
difficult and outside of the area of the

297
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:54,720
usual responsibilities saying you know

298
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:56,938
you don't see a tak like they had in

299
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,319
humble county well I think that in San

300
00:13:56,938 --> 00:14:02,278
Francisco where you have an

301
00:13:58,318 --> 00:14:06,118
uncooperative local da with the state

302
00:14:02,278 --> 00:14:08,129
laws you have the mayor and the public

303
00:14:06,119 --> 00:14:09,778
health establishment on your side as

304
00:14:08,129 --> 00:14:11,639
soon as we get back to San Francisco

305
00:14:09,778 --> 00:14:13,889
Dennis and I have a meeting with the

306
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:17,249
head of the San Francisco Health

307
00:14:13,889 --> 00:14:19,168
Department that we will start moving

308
00:14:17,249 --> 00:14:22,709
forward in making something happen de

309
00:14:19,168 --> 00:14:26,100
facto that would be politically suicidal

310
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:28,458
to to be punitive and to attempt to stop

311
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:31,798
by either federal or state intervention

312
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:35,728
that theoretically they could but to

313
00:14:31,798 --> 00:14:38,938
target people who are compassionately

314
00:14:35,729 --> 00:14:40,499
using cannabis this especially in an

315
00:14:38,938 --> 00:14:44,818
election year would not look too good

316
00:14:40,499 --> 00:14:47,100
with regard to washington the state of

317
00:14:44,818 --> 00:14:49,078
unreality inside the beltway that

318
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:51,209
doesn't really have any substantive

319
00:14:49,078 --> 00:14:54,588
health policy and to do something

320
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:58,768
negative like this would be I would say

321
00:14:54,589 --> 00:15:02,189
not good politics but back to trying to

322
00:14:58,769 --> 00:15:05,908
implement the intent of this we are

323
00:15:02,188 --> 00:15:09,000
going to be presenting to the state to

324
00:15:05,908 --> 00:15:12,240
party of the county health person then

325
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,429
a draft of a questionnaire in a form

326
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,919
that we will have distributed by the

327
00:15:14,429 --> 00:15:20,629
health department and publicized by them

328
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:24,269
to the physicians in San Francisco that

329
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:28,350
we are starting a research project to

330
00:15:24,269 --> 00:15:32,960
determine the impact of this in terms of

331
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:36,750
the first way of accurately assessing

332
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:39,330
actual hazards and benefits of cannabis

333
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:44,340
products okay that will involve the

334
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:46,650
visits by the the users to their family

335
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:52,280
physician or if they don't have one find

336
00:15:46,649 --> 00:15:55,319
one because to get a prescription for us

337
00:15:52,279 --> 00:15:57,919
using cannabis they'd have to have a

338
00:15:55,320 --> 00:16:00,300
signature of a prescribing physician

339
00:15:57,919 --> 00:16:02,849
because it mandates that we're not going

340
00:16:00,299 --> 00:16:05,809
to be punished for prescribing and then

341
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:09,060
should the police come and investigate a

342
00:16:05,809 --> 00:16:13,139
growing situation in a window box or

343
00:16:09,059 --> 00:16:14,939
something of that nature patio that the

344
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:17,009
person with the furnish proof that this

345
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:19,190
was for medicinal purposes and they

346
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:22,710
would be functionally sheltered and

347
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:26,190
decriminalized for their compassionate

348
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:28,200
access to cannabis now as a quid pro quo

349
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:31,950
we ask that they give us certain facts

350
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:33,780
with regard to their the use for what

351
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:35,879
meant for what ailment and we have all

352
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:37,889
these conditions listed here and this

353
00:16:35,879 --> 00:16:42,000
will be part of the form that will ask

354
00:16:37,889 --> 00:16:43,980
the patient to a complete and the

355
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,480
physician also now I know one thing that

356
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:49,710
the taxpayers from the bay area would be

357
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:52,289
concerned about is when the berlin wall

358
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:55,440
came down all the people came rushing

359
00:16:52,289 --> 00:16:57,929
out and there was an overflow into a new

360
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:00,000
city and not enough to take care of when

361
00:16:57,929 --> 00:17:02,009
this wall comes bursting down in san

362
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,078
francisco you can have people from Miami

363
00:17:02,009 --> 00:17:06,359
New York everywhere coming into San

364
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:07,859
Francisco needing this medicine to

365
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:10,169
relieve themselves from AIDS glaucoma

366
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:12,659
etc etc and there's going to be an

367
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:14,370
enormous amount it appears people

368
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:16,470
seeking your help how are you going to

369
00:17:14,369 --> 00:17:19,559
prepare to take care of that I think the

370
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:20,860
San Francisco physicians can respond to

371
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:22,720
that challenge

372
00:17:20,859 --> 00:17:26,078
and that they can provide them with good

373
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:28,509
medicine and also with frankness with

374
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:31,210
regard to their substance use patterns

375
00:17:28,509 --> 00:17:35,019
and not have to be hypocritical or

376
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:36,759
fearful that anything will be happening

377
00:17:35,019 --> 00:17:40,298
to them so that they're not going to

378
00:17:36,759 --> 00:17:43,599
turn down the business and we're talking

379
00:17:40,298 --> 00:17:46,089
about people publicizing to the medical

380
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:48,279
community that this is what happened and

381
00:17:46,089 --> 00:17:49,808
this is what the public health

382
00:17:48,279 --> 00:17:52,089
department is doing to try to help

383
00:17:49,808 --> 00:17:54,190
implement it one of the things we're

384
00:17:52,089 --> 00:17:55,899
going to ask for some office space in

385
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:58,509
the public health department but we'll

386
00:17:55,900 --> 00:18:01,120
pay for it okay and we're then going to

387
00:17:58,509 --> 00:18:03,640
start soliciting contributions or money

388
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:05,168
to implement this research project

389
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:07,570
another thing that we're going to ask

390
00:18:05,169 --> 00:18:09,610
the Public Health Department do is to

391
00:18:07,569 --> 00:18:13,918
monitor the purity quality and strength

392
00:18:09,609 --> 00:18:16,119
and do chemical analyses on the hampa

393
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:18,220
specimens that will be submitted by

394
00:18:16,119 --> 00:18:21,939
users because they would like to know

395
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:26,110
about different issues of purity for

396
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:28,840
example fungi and molds this is really a

397
00:18:26,109 --> 00:18:31,869
critical issue for the AIDS patients

398
00:18:28,839 --> 00:18:34,329
because those that have compromised

399
00:18:31,869 --> 00:18:38,439
immune logic systems and problems with

400
00:18:34,329 --> 00:18:41,759
recurrent pneumonia to have sources of

401
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:45,850
mold or fungi come in courtesy of the

402
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:47,769
the leaf would be not good for their

403
00:18:45,849 --> 00:18:51,459
health probably okay and so we have to

404
00:18:47,769 --> 00:18:53,470
study the level of occurrences of these

405
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:55,569
kinds of contaminants molds fungi

406
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:56,769
possibly somebody might have something

407
00:18:55,569 --> 00:18:58,418
in their soil they didn't know about

408
00:18:56,769 --> 00:19:01,720
that would get into there like a heavy

409
00:18:58,419 --> 00:19:03,460
metal and that the essential health the

410
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:06,009
department's laboratory would be a pro

411
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:07,990
would be protecting the health of the

412
00:19:06,009 --> 00:19:09,819
citizens of San Francisco for drug

413
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:12,160
surety with regard to cannabis plus

414
00:19:09,819 --> 00:19:14,769
providing us a source of information for

415
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:17,790
other phases of research which will be

416
00:19:14,769 --> 00:19:21,700
structure-activity relationships and

417
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:27,609
variety strain other kinds of botanical

418
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:30,279
or a species the kinds of different

419
00:19:27,609 --> 00:19:33,158
differences or growth techniques will

420
00:19:30,279 --> 00:19:35,858
also start coming online with regard

421
00:19:33,159 --> 00:19:38,559
two issues of what are good medicines

422
00:19:35,858 --> 00:19:41,259
what are undesirable effects and all

423
00:19:38,558 --> 00:19:43,418
that generating new research and new new

424
00:19:41,259 --> 00:19:45,579
approaches to problem that's right in a

425
00:19:43,419 --> 00:19:47,710
population which will give us this

426
00:19:45,579 --> 00:19:49,778
information in exchange for being

427
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:52,269
protected sounds excellent and this is

428
00:19:49,778 --> 00:19:55,749
the kind of thing that I'm quite excited

429
00:19:52,269 --> 00:19:58,690
about I think that we are sending the

430
00:19:55,749 --> 00:20:01,028
right signal to the Beltway back here

431
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:03,690
and we need to do so still and i think

432
00:20:01,028 --> 00:20:07,058
that this kind of initiative will help

433
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:08,798
demystify because it will involve the

434
00:20:07,058 --> 00:20:12,700
medical community and learning what is

435
00:20:08,798 --> 00:20:14,288
real and what is hysteria so that more

436
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:17,048
legitimate information will come from

437
00:20:14,288 --> 00:20:19,118
this and i'm asking to be appointed

438
00:20:17,048 --> 00:20:21,759
principal investigator for this research

439
00:20:19,118 --> 00:20:23,259
effort I'm sure solista coordinated and

440
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:24,878
we've also enjoyed having you on our

441
00:20:23,259 --> 00:20:26,519
show we really have to go at this point

442
00:20:24,878 --> 00:20:28,449
but we'd like to have you come back soon

443
00:20:26,519 --> 00:20:30,159
next time you get a chance to be on the

444
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:32,409
show would you please certainly will

445
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:34,119
thank you very much thank you very much

446
00:20:32,409 --> 00:20:35,559
for tuning in to our program we're doing

447
00:20:34,118 --> 00:20:37,298
what we can to bring in the information

448
00:20:35,558 --> 00:20:39,128
to you as quickly as we as we come

449
00:20:37,298 --> 00:20:43,499
across it until we're in touch again

450
00:20:39,128 --> 00:20:43,498
keep happy keep strong keep why
