1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:06,080
I've been working with the safer shirts

2
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:08,000
ever since I read the book marijuana is

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:11,120
safer so why are we driving people to

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,280
drink by Steve Fox Paul armano Mason

5
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:14,838
tvert with forward by retired Seattle

6
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:17,278
police chief Norm

7
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:18,439
Stamper I'm an occupational safety and

8
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:21,160
health

9
00:00:18,439 --> 00:00:23,399
professional and I believe an employee

10
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:26,000
who comes into work after a night of

11
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:27,678
drinking is more dangerous than an

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,960
employee who comes in to work after a

13
00:00:27,678 --> 00:00:31,959
night of

14
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,960
smoking

15
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:36,280
it's part of the reason why I'm working

16
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,640
with real legalization we have the short

17
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:40,480
sheets you've probably seen a petition

18
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,079
that can hold 20 signatures somebody

19
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:44,718
standing out in front of

20
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:48,320
Walmart asking you to

21
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:51,079
uh give the chickens the larger

22
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,960
cages but uh with our petition we also

23
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:57,120
have an another option called the short

24
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,120
sheet it only holds four

25
00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:02,679
signatures but it also folds in into its

26
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:04,359
own envelope so you get a couple of

27
00:01:02,679 --> 00:01:05,599
signatures from your friends put a stamp

28
00:01:04,359 --> 00:01:08,478
