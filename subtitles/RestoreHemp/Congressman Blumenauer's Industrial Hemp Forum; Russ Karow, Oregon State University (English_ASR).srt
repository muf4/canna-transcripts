1
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:05,000
my name again again is Russ Carol I'm

2
00:00:03,279 --> 00:00:07,439
head of the crop and soil science

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,440
department at Oregon State University

4
00:00:07,439 --> 00:00:11,638
and what I'm going to do is spin off

5
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:14,239
from the product side of this and talk a

6
00:00:11,638 --> 00:00:17,118
little bit about some of the production

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:19,800
uh realities as far as we know them at

8
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:23,240
this point in time uh here in Oregon and

9
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:26,118
what that may mean for hemp industry uh

10
00:00:23,239 --> 00:00:30,000
in the state of Oregan and so trying to

11
00:00:26,118 --> 00:00:32,118
align expectations at this point so

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,480
crops new crops alternate crops are

13
00:00:32,118 --> 00:00:37,399
nothing new to the state of Oregon uh

14
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:39,078
we've got at last estimate over 220

15
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:41,960
different crops that are being grown

16
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:44,079
crops and natural resource uh products

17
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:47,439
across the state there's over a hundred

18
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:49,679
of those crops Commodities that have a

19
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:53,159
farm gate value of over a million

20
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:55,719
dollars so unlike other parts of the

21
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:58,558
nation where the Growers are faced with

22
00:00:55,719 --> 00:01:01,879
very few cropping Alternatives we have

23
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:03,640
many choices in the the state and unlike

24
00:01:01,878 --> 00:01:06,000
growers in some other parts of the

25
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:08,599
nation if you ask a grower here you

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,680
bring them something and say what do you

27
00:01:08,599 --> 00:01:15,199
think about chory the questions they'll

28
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,118
ask are uh where can I get the seed what

29
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,759
do I know what do you can you tell me

30
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:21,280
about the production conditions how much

31
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:26,640
is it worth and when are you going to

32
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:29,400
pay me and from those four points people

33
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:32,159
can if it's something that is workable

34
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:35,240
they can pretty well figure it out and

35
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:38,040
see if it makes sense in our production

36
00:01:35,239 --> 00:01:39,478
environment what I've done in the back I

37
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,200
don't know if everybody picked it up but

38
00:01:39,478 --> 00:01:44,039
there's a handout that has far more

39
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:46,240
technical detail than most of you are

40
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,079
probably going to be interested in but

41
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:50,560
for those that are interested in

42
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:54,039
thinking about producing hemp I'd ask

43
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,680
you to pick a copy of that up and uh

44
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:59,079
take a look at some of the information

45
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:02,200
that's there the short story is that

46
00:01:59,078 --> 00:02:05,919
hemp is a warm seasoned crop it would be

47
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:08,800
very similar to Sweet Corn soybeans

48
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:11,680
sunflower if you think about the wamit

49
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:14,560
valley and everybody goes well we grow

50
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:17,040
corn in the wamit valley but it's sweet

51
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:20,319
corn it's not grain corn there's very

52
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:22,959
little grain corn grown here very few

53
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:26,000
sunflowers very few soybeans and that's

54
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:28,959
because of the temperature regime that

55
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,318
we all love uh in Western Oregon and

56
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:32,759
across Oregon

57
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:35,199
we have a Mediterranean climate uh

58
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:38,239
rainfall comes during the winter months

59
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:42,199
and during the summer we have cool night

60
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:44,439
temperatures and moderate uh heat we

61
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:46,518
rarely of late we've been getting up

62
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:48,639
into the 90s and hundreds but generally

63
00:02:46,519 --> 00:02:50,640
we expect that the summer temperatures

64
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:54,479
are going to be in the high

65
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:56,759
80s uh something like a corn plant uh

66
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:59,119
the optimum growing conditions for a

67
00:02:56,759 --> 00:03:02,399
corn plant is if the nighttime

68
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:05,000
temperature Dr drops below 50Â° the plant

69
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,959
goes into physiological shock because

70
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:12,000
it's not designed to grow with its

71
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:13,560
physiology at temperatures that low uh

72
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,280
and the top end temperature for

73
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:20,239
something like grow corn is uh 86Â° so

74
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,560
it's got a fairly narrow range uh we

75
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:25,080
think that hemp has a wider range in

76
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,360
that we've not growing hemp here we've

77
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:30,000
not grown current varieties but we can

78
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,239
look at the information that's available

79
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,639
from other parts of the world and what

80
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:38,519
we find in most plant biology plant

81
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:41,199
physiology is that you don't change the

82
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:43,039
plant significantly there may be things

83
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:45,438
at the edges and that's what we're going

84
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:49,079
to have to look at the plants that are

85
00:03:45,438 --> 00:03:52,479
well adapted uh to colder night

86
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:54,200
temperatures shorter growing Seasons uh

87
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:56,479
but at this point looking at the

88
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:59,238
information we can find from both Canada

89
00:03:56,479 --> 00:04:01,840
and from Europe and trying to translate

90
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:05,000
that into into an Oregon context we're

91
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:08,039
going to be really hard pushed uh to

92
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:11,039
grow seeded hemp here in the mamit

93
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:13,000
valley uh the maturity the because of

94
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:14,959
the temperature regimes that we've got

95
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:19,439
you're going to be looking at

96
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:23,360
maturation uh in late September October

97
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:25,680
and if you're trying to uh mature a crop

98
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:28,840
dry a crop down you know what late

99
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,879
September and October is like fiber crop

100
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:33,519
may be much easier

101
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:36,639
depending on the varieties the the

102
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:39,680
maturity of the fiber occurs when the

103
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:41,680
male flowers on the plant have matured

104
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,400
so it's much earlier in the growing

105
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,840
season and there you'd be looking at

106
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:50,279
things in July August which make much

107
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:53,478
more sense uh so we may be able to

108
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:56,198
easily grow fiber crops the seeded crops

109
00:04:53,478 --> 00:04:58,560
to getting both seed and fiber may be

110
00:04:56,199 --> 00:05:01,038
more difficult and then the other thing

111
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,399
we have to think about is we enjoy our

112
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:07,240
dry Summers but if you're trying to grow

113
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:09,638
a crop uh during the summer and actively

114
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,759
grow that crop as the industrial hemp

115
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:16,319
would be growing you're going to need

116
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:19,038
water um and if you think about the corn

117
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:21,879
the green beans uh other crops that are

118
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:22,959
out in the valley in the summer months

119
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:24,879
they're being

120
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:26,399
irrigated and so you're going to have to

121
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:28,478
figure out if you're going to grow the

122
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:30,519
crop on large scale where are you going

123
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:33,279
to get the water from

124
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:35,758
and then the question that other large

125
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:39,119
commercial the current large commercial

126
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:41,840
Growers are going to ask is what's it

127
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:44,038
worth what are you going to pay me and

128
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:47,959
they're going to look at the production

129
00:05:44,038 --> 00:05:50,599
economics of that do I put my water on

130
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:53,799
green beans do I put my water on sweet

131
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:55,759
corn which are very high value crops

132
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:58,639
versus something like

133
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:00,280
him so there are you know we need to

134
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,120
think about some of of those

135
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:04,879
possibilities now there are other parts

136
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:08,079
of the state we very successfully grow

137
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:10,560
corn in Hermiston Ontario you're further

138
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:14,079
Inland they still have a Mediterranean

139
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:17,680
climate but those are heat pockets as is

140
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:19,800
Southwestern Oregon so we very

141
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:23,199
successfully grow corn in the Hermon

142
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:27,639
area they set National yield records uh

143
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:30,280
for 300 325 bushel corn so you could

144
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:34,240
grow hemp in that environment very

145
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:38,478
easily but you're up against 300 bushel

146
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:41,720
corn at $5 a bushel at this point you're

147
00:06:38,478 --> 00:06:43,879
up against potatoes carrots green beans

148
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:46,280
so again The Growers there are going to

149
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:48,680
look at what is this crop bring me

150
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:52,799
versus the value that I'm going to get

151
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:56,639
out of it in Rick's area we have grown

152
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:59,840
dry land corn in parts of the Columbia

153
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:01,759
Basin there's a experiment station

154
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:04,598
called the morrow experiment station and

155
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:06,800
they've grown Dryland corn uh for the

156
00:07:04,598 --> 00:07:08,918
last four or five years and they're

157
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:12,000
getting about

158
00:07:08,918 --> 00:07:14,478
3540 bushel corn you may have seen some

159
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,000
of that that Brian tuck had

160
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:20,199
out but again if you're getting 300

161
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,199
bushels in the irrigated area and you're

162
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:27,319
getting 3540 bushels in the Dryland area

163
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:29,520
you know again align expectations for

164
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:33,160
what you're looking at as far as uh

165
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:35,639
yields in those possible

166
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:38,800
situations so I guess as I think about

167
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:41,079
this we can do anything on small scales

168
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:44,120
if somebody is interested in growing a

169
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:45,839
crop in this state we've got a pliable

170
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:47,879
enough environment that you're going to

171
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:49,478
be able to grow what you want you're

172
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:51,000
going to have to figure out where you

173
00:07:49,478 --> 00:07:53,478
get the water from you're going to have

174
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,800
to figure out how you can plant it early

175
00:07:53,478 --> 00:07:58,240
and what you could do as far as

176
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:00,199
protecting uh the seed so that you can

177
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:03,439
get it planted and C capture early

178
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:06,960
season uh growing heat units uh there

179
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:09,719
are ways you can uh look at it but don't

180
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:12,478
assume that you're going to be able to

181
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:14,520
uh immediately once we've got it legal

182
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:18,120
to grow that it's immediately going to

183
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:20,598
move out into large scale production so

184
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:22,560
think about those things align

185
00:08:20,598 --> 00:08:24,360
expectations appropriately and we'll be

186
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,360
in good

187
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,360
shape
