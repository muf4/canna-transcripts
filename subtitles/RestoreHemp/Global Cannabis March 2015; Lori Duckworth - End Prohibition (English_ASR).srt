1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,040
thanks for having me up here it's great

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:07,798

00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:12,539
Medford for five years

5
00:00:10,859 --> 00:00:14,879
I'm the former director of Southern

6
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:17,519
Oregon normal I was the executive

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:20,278
director for five years up until June

8
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:24,539
1st of 2012.

9
00:00:20,278 --> 00:00:27,240
May 23 2012 my facility was raided by

10
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:31,019
Madge that's the Medford Area drug and

11
00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:33,179
gang enforcement in Jackson County

12
00:00:31,018 --> 00:00:34,679
under the direction of the state of

13
00:00:33,179 --> 00:00:36,899
Oregon

14
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:38,700
my husband and I were arrested and we

15
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:43,799
were in Jackson County jail for seven

16
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:46,980
days under 550 000 bail each

17
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:49,878
we were charged with more than 25 class

18
00:00:46,979 --> 00:00:49,878
A felonies

19
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:56,399
we knew our rights because we had great

20
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:58,920
attorneys

21
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:02,780
my attorney was Paul Loney

22
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,780
you can see his Banner right over here

23
00:01:04,978 --> 00:01:11,579
my husband had Leland Burger many of you

24
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:14,519
know my great friendly limberger

25
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:16,859
they're both Normal attorneys I suggest

26
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:18,539
you support normal

27
00:01:16,859 --> 00:01:20,840
because they've been around for a long

28
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,840
time

29
00:01:22,019 --> 00:01:28,560
Southern Oregon normal is no longer in

30
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:28,560
existence that chapter closed

31
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:36,199
there's Portland normal now

32
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,200
I'm signing up today

33
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:40,859
Russ bellville's executive director

34
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:43,438
there I believe

35
00:01:40,859 --> 00:01:45,478
he's one of my mentors

36
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:47,039
I had several mentors along the way

37
00:01:45,478 --> 00:01:50,039
after I stepped out of the Cannabis

38
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:53,100
closet after 24 years in health care and

39
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:56,399
leaving the corporate corruption

40
00:01:53,099 --> 00:02:00,199
I push legal pills on geriatric patients

41
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,200
and held their hands as they died

42
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:06,600
it was a shame with the nursing Society

43
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:09,539
did to those patients knowing that

44
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:12,618
Oxycontin killed them and the plant

45
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:12,618
could have saved them

46
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,800
I watched my husband Drool on himself

47
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:18,840
when Oxycontin came out because he was

48
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,920
one of the test patients that got to try

49
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,719
it out

50
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:24,299
our children played in the yard while

51
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:27,479
their dad drooled in the chair

52
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:30,180
I said no more I talked to his doctor

53
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:33,479
and we started him on cannabis he got

54
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:36,060
off all the narcotics except for one

55
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:38,519
he was on six

56
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:40,378
he had back surgery and used cannabis

57
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:42,840
and one narcotic

58
00:02:40,378 --> 00:02:44,759
he still uses that one narcotic to this

59
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:47,900
day

60
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:47,899
and cannabis

61
00:02:49,259 --> 00:02:54,620
he's a functioning father and

62
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,620
grandfather

63
00:02:54,659 --> 00:02:58,039
he grows our medicine

64
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:04,860
he does not rely on the government to

65
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:07,080
pay over twelve thousand dollars a month

66
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:10,940
on Pharmaceuticals under the Oregon

67
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,940
Health Plan like they used to

68
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:21,180
our resources in this state are wasted

69
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:24,598
because our federal government refuses

70
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:28,739
to take this off of the scheduling as a

71
00:03:24,598 --> 00:03:31,619
one it's wrong we have to change it so

72
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:32,939
all of you've heard today about the

73

111
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:18,780

00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:45,899
from cancer this week we lost Jesse

120
00:05:40,978 --> 00:05:48,180
who is an advocate for PTSD and even sat

121
00:05:45,899 --> 00:05:50,519
on a panel at Southern Oregon University

122
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:52,759
with Peter Buckley and Paul Stanford and

123
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:52,758
myself

124
00:05:52,918 --> 00:05:57,899
advocating

125
00:05:55,259 --> 00:06:00,960
to get the law changed and change the

126
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:03,198
law we did and we qualify PTSD in this

127
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:03,198
state

128
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,840
May Jesse rest in peace

129
00:06:09,418 --> 00:06:14,038
I have five weeks to go and my felony

130
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:17,340
will be turned over to a misdemeanor

131
00:06:14,038 --> 00:06:20,159
it's been 11 months of bench probation

132
00:06:17,339 --> 00:06:23,219
I was able to keep my patient card and

133
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:27,139
my son became my grower

134
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:27,139
we even got our guns back

135
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:33,538
in two more years

136
00:06:31,379 --> 00:06:36,478
I get to have my record expunged and I

137
00:06:33,538 --> 00:06:37,500
can get my concealed handgun carry back

138
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:40,318

139
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:43,560

00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:52,220

144
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:59,759
