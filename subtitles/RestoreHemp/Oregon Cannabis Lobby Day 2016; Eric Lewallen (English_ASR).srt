1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,179
my name is Eric Llewellyn I'm part of

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:08,910
the crh I also am a board member for

3
00:00:06,179 --> 00:00:11,370
parents for pot I'm also a patient and

4
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:14,699
that's what I'm here fighting for is is

5
00:00:11,369 --> 00:00:17,969
the patient accent of this all us as

6
00:00:14,699 --> 00:00:20,160
patients we we can't always get out in

7
00:00:17,969 --> 00:00:23,250
life and do the things that we need to

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:27,359
do without certain medicines a lot of

9
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:29,189
people rely on this medicine without it

10
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,890
people can't live their lives go out

11
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:33,780
raise their families heck I couldn't be

12
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:37,739
here right now if it weren't for

13
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:40,558
cannabis we all fought for the right to

14
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:42,808
have it as a medical use we all need to

15
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:46,619
continue to fight to keep it medical and

16
00:00:42,808 --> 00:00:49,468
help with those that can't get out to

17
00:00:46,619 --> 00:00:51,419
grow it obtained it smoke it even

18
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:54,149
smoking like my fellow partner nikki

19
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:56,250
says people into place to be able to

20
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:58,379
smoke their cannabis and if they're

21
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:00,179
taking those places from us where are we

22
00:00:58,378 --> 00:01:02,808
going to be able to do it safely how are

23
00:01:00,179 --> 00:01:06,868

24
00:01:02,808 --> 00:01:08,519
maintain life I'm just basically saying

25
00:01:06,868 --> 00:01:10,560
that we need to continue to fight don't

26
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:13,289
stop the fight because we've legalized

27
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,670
it for recreational that's you know one

28
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:17,100
step we try to accomplish we

29
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:18,900
accomplished but now we they need to

30
00:01:17,099 --> 00:01:21,089
