1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,039
happy global cannabis March I am so

2
00:00:06,059 --> 00:00:09,808
happy to be one of the newest board

3
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:12,928
members Portland normal in the

4
00:00:09,808 --> 00:00:15,029
legislative director capacity I'm able

5
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:17,250
to work with lee berger in the

6
00:00:15,029 --> 00:00:19,019
legislative committee director as well

7
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:21,929
as all the other board members to try to

8
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:25,198
impact the oregon cannabis laws on

9
00:00:21,929 --> 00:00:27,719
behalf of the consumer so this last

10
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:30,269
session I lobbied on behalf of Portland

11
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:32,000
normal and on behalf of all of us to try

12
00:00:30,268 --> 00:00:34,710
to get reasonable regulations met

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,909
instead of regulations that we might not

14
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:40,700
be so happy with and while port well the

15
00:00:38,909 --> 00:00:44,069
olcc is very proud of themselves

16
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:46,200
recently for issuing eight grow licenses

17
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:49,439
we've had those applications since

18
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:51,780
January so it's really important that we

19
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:54,570
move forward in a more timely manner

20
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:56,189
than that when people have plants in the

21
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:58,378
ground and ready to go in the ground and

22
00:00:56,189 --> 00:01:02,369
they're not covered legally even though

23
00:00:58,378 --> 00:01:04,530
they very much should be we worked

24
00:01:02,369 --> 00:01:07,530
really hard on trying to get the lounges

25
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:09,570
to stay open and because the Oregon

26
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:11,849
Clean Air Act these weren't named an

27
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:13,469
emergency and so we weren't allowed to

28
00:01:11,849 --> 00:01:16,908
get them passed in this very short

29
00:01:13,469 --> 00:01:20,069
amount of time however we did get

30
00:01:16,909 --> 00:01:22,859
expungement for criminal records more

31
00:01:20,069 --> 00:01:26,969
thoroughly than was previously there and

32
00:01:22,859 --> 00:01:28,349
we got other penalties reduced so that

33
00:01:26,969 --> 00:01:31,019
we could have a little bit more freedom

34
00:01:28,349 --> 00:01:33,179
and the things that we do this year

35
00:01:31,019 --> 00:01:37,259
we're going to be doing a consumer Bill

36
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:39,930
of Rights where we will be tackling the

37
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:42,989
issues of the Oregon Clean Air Act and

38
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:46,200
the issues of pre-employment drug

39
00:01:42,989 --> 00:01:48,060
screening and your landlord being able

40
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,609
to discriminate you against you because

41
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:52,769
you consume cannabis and I'm really

42
00:01:50,609 --> 00:01:55,379
excited to get moving forward on these

43
00:01:52,769 --> 00:01:57,030
things because we need to make sure that

44
00:01:55,379 --> 00:01:59,670
our rights are just as equal as those

45
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:01,618
that might be choosing alcohol as their

46
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:06,200
substance of choice even though ours is

47
00:02:01,618 --> 00:02:10,469
far safer and I'd also like to say that

48
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:13,378
if people could please join us at the

49
00:02:10,469 --> 00:02:13,620
rules advisory committee meetings for

50
00:02:13,378 --> 00:02:17,459
the

51
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:19,799
rigan Health Authority and the olcc this

52
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:22,920
is where the rules are actually drafted

53
00:02:19,799 --> 00:02:26,250
from the legislation and the bulk of the

54
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:29,009
discussion happens for us to be able to

55
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:31,860
make these regulations and without a lot

56
00:02:29,009 --> 00:02:34,739
of input from our community we are

57
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:38,459
seeing the results of their not hearing

58
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:41,400
from us we need more input at these

59
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:43,019
meetings you can email it but when they

60
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,450
release the regulation that is

61
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:48,299
ridiculous you have to use your voices

62
00:02:45,449 --> 00:02:50,369
you have to tell them that what they're

63
00:02:48,299 --> 00:02:53,159
doing is ridiculous and it can't be as

64
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:56,189
simple as we're defending our ommp you

65
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:58,439
have to read what they wrote and tell

66
00:02:56,189 --> 00:03:01,408
them what is wrong with it and without

67
00:02:58,439 --> 00:03:04,530
that feedback we're getting this crap

68
00:03:01,408 --> 00:03:07,108
legislation rules that nobody can handle

69
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:10,289
or deal with or wants to because they're

70
00:03:07,109 --> 00:03:12,959
not hearing from enough of us and even

71
00:03:10,289 --> 00:03:15,000
when they do hear from us sometimes they

72
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,158
just choose to do what they want instead

73
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,489
which is why patients can't get their

74
00:03:17,158 --> 00:03:23,310
extracts right now in bulk the bulk of

75
00:03:20,489 --> 00:03:25,469
the reason is because we were not hurt

76
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:28,500
so we need to make sure that we're

77
00:03:25,469 --> 00:03:31,739
defending ourselves and our patients who

78
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:34,378
is our us because if we don't we're

79
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:36,450
seeing what happens and it's their

80
00:03:34,378 --> 00:03:38,489
choice that they already made they

81
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:41,548
already decided that they were going to

82
00:03:38,489 --> 00:03:45,030
redo the ommp so if we don't give them

83
00:03:41,549 --> 00:03:46,949
all of our input all of the time they're

84
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:49,979
going to do that without us and that's

85
00:03:46,949 --> 00:03:52,349
the scary thought they have to hear what

86
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:55,738
your doses are the OHA limiting a

87
00:03:52,348 --> 00:03:58,469
patient's dose is complete and

88
00:03:55,739 --> 00:04:00,299
it should have never happened and when

89
00:03:58,469 --> 00:04:02,430
we tried to get an amendment to say that

90
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:05,459
the OHA couldn't limit a patient's dose

91
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:07,530
it was pretty much decided that they had

92
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:10,169
that power because the county health

93
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:12,359
authorities wanted to make sure that we

94
00:04:10,169 --> 00:04:14,189
regulated it for children in case they

95
00:04:12,359 --> 00:04:16,680
got inside of it instead of getting into

96
00:04:14,189 --> 00:04:18,569
regulated for adults who consume it

97
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:21,949
responsibly and keep it out of the hands

98
00:04:18,569 --> 00:04:24,899
of their children that is not acceptable

99
00:04:21,949 --> 00:04:26,329
it's not too late we're moving into a

100
00:04:24,899 --> 00:04:29,269
long session

101
00:04:26,329 --> 00:04:30,948
in January it's going to be six months

102
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:33,198
long and we're going to see copious

103
00:04:30,949 --> 00:04:35,569
amounts of that they're going

104
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:38,090
to try to pass and it's going to be up

105
00:04:35,569 --> 00:04:41,780
to each and every one of us to stand up

106
00:04:38,089 --> 00:04:43,698
for that we have to defend our programs

107
00:04:41,779 --> 00:04:45,500
and we have to make sure that while

108
00:04:43,699 --> 00:04:48,050
they're rolling out new programs that

109
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:51,079
it's done responsibly the more voices

110
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:54,740
that they hear doing that the better and

111
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:56,658
there's no way the any of us can let the

112
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:59,930
ohm and people to the wayside during

113
00:04:56,658 --> 00:05:02,899
this we already saw what can happen so

114
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:05,120
please pay attention to the regulations

115

to really understand how you can give

121
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:24,139
your input on what you think because we

122
00:05:21,259 --> 00:05:26,509
all think very similarly on most of

123
00:05:24,139 --> 00:05:28,460
these issues the more of that united

124
00:05:26,509 --> 00:05:31,038
