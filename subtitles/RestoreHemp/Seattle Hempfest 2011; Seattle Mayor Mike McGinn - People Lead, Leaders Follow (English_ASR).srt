2
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:05,080
speaking in my official capacity as

3
00:00:02,919 --> 00:00:08,679
mayor I have a message to all of you out

4
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:08,679
there welcome to

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:17,080
Seattle you know it's it's interesting

6
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:19,879
uh during my campaign somebody asked me

7
00:00:17,079 --> 00:00:22,759
what my position was on marijuana

8
00:00:19,879 --> 00:00:25,759
legalization and what I said was that if

9
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:28,000
every politician an elected official who

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:31,220
had ever tried marijuana voted to

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,859
legalize it it would be legal in an

12
00:00:31,219 --> 00:00:33,878
[Music]

13
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:36,719
[Applause]

14
00:00:33,878 --> 00:00:39,640
instant it's the truth it is the truth

15
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,800
folks that we have we have been as a

16
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:43,799
society very hypocritical and Rick

17
00:00:41,799 --> 00:00:47,399
Steves has spoken about this and your

18
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:49,319
prior speakers have spoken about this so

19
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:52,558
we live in a very complicated world

20
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:54,640
right now where attitudes are changing

21
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:57,718
and that makes it harder on on lots of

22
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:01,000
folks it makes it harder on people that

23
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:03,359
want safe access to drugs it makes it

24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,280
harder um you know on parents who trying

25
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,079
to figure out what their kids to do tell

26
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,079
tell their kids what to do it makes it

27
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:11,280
harder on our police force too by the

28
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:13,319
way and I'll talk about that in a second

29
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,359
it makes it harder but there's a pathway

30
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:18,478
here that'll make it easier and that

31
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:22,599
pathway is to recognize that prohibition

32
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:27,400
as a strategy has not worked the War on

33
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:28,919
Drugs has not work we can do better

34
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,280
we're in a time where attitudes are

35
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:34,879
changing attitudes are changing so we

36
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:37,399
just have to keep diligently talking and

37
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:39,158
explaining and and being authentic to

38
00:01:37,399 --> 00:01:41,560
our friends and neighbor and our family

39
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:43,680
members about this issue and attitudes

40
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:46,600
do change and we can see attitudes

41
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:49,280
change for the better you know and on a

42
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:50,599
number of topics 20 or 30 years ago you

43
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,640
wouldn't even have spoken about the

44
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:56,199
issue of gay marriage to anyone and

45
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,478
that's changed 20 or 30 years ago

46
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:00,719
legalization seemed a distant something

47
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:03,158
way in the distance and that's changed

48
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:06,759
here in the city of Seattle by popular

49
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:09,118
vote we went as far as we could go which

50
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:12,239
is that

51
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:14,360
enforcement of marijuana laws for small

52
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:18,080
amounts the possession of small amounts

53
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:22,440
is the lowest enforcement priority for

54
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,440
our police lowest enforcements

55
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:31,800
priority did you know on that the people

56
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:35,080
led the people people led and the

57
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:38,200
politicians followed now by the way just

58
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:40,719
do us a favor do us a favor lowest

59
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:42,560
enforcement priority does not mean legal

60
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:44,080
make life easier for everybody including

61
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,479
our police officers don't light up in

62
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:49,159
front of them just make life easier for

63
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:49,158
everybody please

64
00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:55,680
okay but they take the law seriously in

65
00:02:52,360 --> 00:03:00,480
the state of Washington the people led

66
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:03,680
again and medical marijuana is legal

67
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:03,679
under state

68
00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:10,439
law now those laws have changed they

69
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,200
become more confusing but the people led

70
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:15,000
and here in the city of Seattle we're

71
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:18,158
listening and we're going to make sure

72
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:22,199
that we do our best to observe that

73
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:24,759
state law uh protect the rights of

74
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:29,000
medical marijuana legitimate medical

75
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:30,250
marijuana users to Safe access to

77
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:34,719
[Applause]

78
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,879
it's not happening everywhere it's not

79
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:38,280
happening in every city but it's

80
00:03:35,878 --> 00:03:40,239
happening in our city now the problem is

81
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:42,438
of course that our law at the city level

82
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,480
the laws at the state level all exists

83
00:03:42,438 --> 00:03:47,318
in a world where it is still illegal at

84
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:50,598
the federal level and we can't we can't

85
00:03:47,318 --> 00:03:53,518
change that from here with our votes but

86
00:03:50,598 --> 00:03:54,878
we can change more state laws both

87
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,319
people have spoken to you about

88
00:03:54,878 --> 00:04:00,878
initiatives you know I mentioned to you

89
00:03:57,318 --> 00:04:03,759
two things the politicians followed

90
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:05,560
because the people led the initiative

91
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:08,598
here in Seattle to make it the lows

92
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:10,959
enforcement priority medical marijuana

93
00:04:08,598 --> 00:04:13,078
you have to keep leading you have to

94
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:15,840
keep leading and I'll do my best as an

95
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:17,560
elected official to lead too I'll do my

96
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,639
best as an elected official to lead too

97
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:21,918
but we need you to keep leading because

98
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:23,960
if we do that we will make these laws

99
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:25,799
make sense we will make this community
