00:01:07,728 --> 00:01:12,439
a production of our political committee

19
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:14,659
and we have an initiative out the Oregon

20
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:17,929
cannabis Tax Act and that initiative

21
00:01:14,659 --> 00:01:20,270
which is on the streets right now well

22
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:22,368
it's a comprehensive regulation system

23
00:01:20,269 --> 00:01:25,369
for cannabis that will allow it to be

24
00:01:22,368 --> 00:01:28,099
sold for medical patients in pharmacies

25
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:31,219
to adult over 21 in state liquor stores

26
00:01:28,099 --> 00:01:33,589
and allow our farmers to grow hemp as a

27
00:01:31,219 --> 00:01:36,409
crop and does there anything else have

28
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:40,340
on that Paul I think you covered it

29
00:01:36,409 --> 00:01:42,799
pretty well the money the proceeds from

30
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:46,100
it will go to the state general fund so

31
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:48,469
it'll cut taxes for all of us 90 percent

32
00:01:46,099 --> 00:01:52,189
of it goes to the state general fund 8%

33
00:01:48,469 --> 00:01:55,700
for drug treatment programs and 1% for a

34
00:01:52,189 --> 00:01:59,870
drug education program 1% for a state

35
00:01:55,700 --> 00:02:02,750
committee to promote industrial hemp all

36
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:06,770
right so it's a sa it's a comprehensive

37
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:07,790
program initiative to to get this and if

38

43
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:24,469
he's an attorney involved in some of the

44
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:27,050
marijuana activists cased here in

45
00:02:24,469 --> 00:02:29,299
Portland and so I wonder if you could

46
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:31,099
tell us why you here tonight Lang I'm

47
00:02:29,299 --> 00:02:33,500
here because we are scheduled to appear

48
00:02:31,098 --> 00:02:35,269
before the Ninth Circuit Court of a pea

49
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:40,099
that's going to be sitting in Portland

50
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:42,469
Oregon on two civil rights cases in some

51
00:02:40,099 --> 00:02:45,560
case in both cases we have the same set

52
00:02:42,469 --> 00:02:47,750
of facts on one issue and Paul Stanford

53
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:50,060
was involved very deeply with that the

54
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:52,219
the large case is Floyd Landreth an

55
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:53,810
activist here in Portland who has been

56
00:02:52,219 --> 00:02:55,849
arrested numerous times for his

57
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:58,340
political activities has a material

58
00:02:55,849 --> 00:03:01,370
seized lots of different actions taken

59
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:04,640
by the city of Portland and that case is

60
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:06,530
a classic civil rights case because the

61
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:08,929
city of Portland through its police

62
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:11,539
officers its city attorney it's City

63
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:13,849
Council has engaged in a systematic

64
00:03:11,539 --> 00:03:16,699
campaign to suppress those who are

65
00:03:13,849 --> 00:03:18,829
trying to change the hemp laws so you're

66
00:03:16,699 --> 00:03:21,289
saying that it's include City the City

67
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:22,969
Council Ana mayor the the defendants

68
00:03:21,289 --> 00:03:25,099
named in this case are 18 police

69
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:27,229
officers six or seven city attorneys

70
00:03:25,099 --> 00:03:29,509
mayor Vera Katz and all the members of

71
00:03:27,229 --> 00:03:34,009
the City Council at the time the case

72
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:37,129
was filed five years ago yeah mr. bloom

73
00:03:34,009 --> 00:03:39,409
an hour has moved on and mr. Lindbergh

74
00:03:37,129 --> 00:03:43,099
has retired they are defendants in the

75
00:03:39,409 --> 00:03:44,870
case and that case is really about the

76
00:03:43,099 --> 00:03:47,019
neighborhood associations and the police

77
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:49,789
department engaging in a conspiracy to

78
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:52,790
stop Floyd Landreth and others from

79
00:03:49,789 --> 00:03:56,000
trying to change the hemp laws and when

80
00:03:52,789 --> 00:03:58,849
that conspiracy became acknowledged by

81
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,680
the police after mr. Landreth was

82
00:03:58,849 --> 00:04:02,659
arrested in one point the police officer

83
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:04,849
in charge of the arrest was interviewed

84
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:06,739
by the press and said he had arrested

85
00:04:04,849 --> 00:04:09,319
mr. Landreth because he did not agree

86
00:04:06,739 --> 00:04:11,120
with what mr. Landreth stood for that he

87
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:12,829
disagreed with his political effort and

88
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,269
that the police and the neighborhood

89
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:16,129
associations were going to stop the

90
00:04:14,269 --> 00:04:18,649
effort that's a classic civil rights

91
00:04:16,129 --> 00:04:20,029
case it went on from there the numerous

92
00:04:18,649 --> 00:04:21,649
complaints we filed with the City

93
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:23,149
Attorney's office with the county with

94
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:25,189
the City Council trying to get them to

95
00:04:23,149 --> 00:04:27,679
take action and their repeated refusal

96
00:04:25,189 --> 00:04:30,740
to do so ended up making all of them

97
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:33,980
defendants as well the second case was

98
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:35,389
really about those activities engaged in

99
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:37,910
by the police department that were

100
00:04:35,389 --> 00:04:40,759
designed to prevent people from signing

101
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:43,520
petitions for the previous marijuana

102
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:44,259
initiative that the campaign to pay for

103
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:46,870
school

104
00:04:44,259 --> 00:04:50,589
regulating him or I forget exactly the

105
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:53,800
battle the previous incarnation previous

106
00:04:50,589 --> 00:04:56,919
incarnation of octa what we had was

107
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:59,500
police officers campaigning on public

108
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:01,390
time in their official position to try

109
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:05,620
and prevent the gathering of signatures

110
00:05:01,389 --> 00:05:07,259
and that they were violating both state

111
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:10,870
law and the United States Constitution

112
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:13,569
in that tax money was being used to fund

113
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:16,300
one side of a political campaign and the

114
00:05:13,569 --> 00:05:17,949
police were engaged in an illegal effort

115
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:19,629
when that was brought to the attention

116
00:05:17,949 --> 00:05:21,339
of the mayor's office the mayor said

117
00:05:19,629 --> 00:05:23,620
basically she didn't care because she

118
00:05:21,339 --> 00:05:25,209
didn't agree with the initiative so on

119
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:27,879
that count the mayor was named as a

120
00:05:25,209 --> 00:05:30,189
defendant as well it brought in five

121
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:32,740
other police officers into the case and

122
00:05:30,189 --> 00:05:34,449
we filed a separate case on behalf of

123
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:36,970
the new marijuana initiative that's

124
00:05:34,449 --> 00:05:38,800
pending now in Oregon gathering

125
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:40,720
signatures now trying to get an

126
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,910
injunction to prevent the police from

127
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,700
engaging in political activity illegally

128
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:47,320
hmm that was thrown out by the same

129
00:05:45,699 --> 00:05:49,479
judge that threw out the other case

130
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:52,180
saying that there were no Federal Claims

131
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:53,800
in either case we are asking the 9th

132
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:55,540
Circuit Court of Appeals to reverse the

133
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:58,120
judge and remove the judge and give us a

134
00:05:55,540 --> 00:06:00,670
judge who's not so biased who will treat

135
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:03,970
him partially the factual and legal

136
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:06,850
claims that are in the case so it just

137
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:08,530
you know it is very amazing off to say I

138
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:10,840
am involved in these cases as an

139
00:06:08,529 --> 00:06:13,269
attorney but still when I stop and think

140
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:15,609
about it's amazing that police officer

141
00:06:13,269 --> 00:06:17,620
can say that you know we don't like what

142
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:18,879
a certain person stands for and so

143
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:20,980
therefore we're gonna stop them

144
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:22,750
well the Landrieu's case isn't really a

145
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:24,670
HAMP case in that sense it's a it's a

146
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:27,459
straight-up First Amendment civil rights

147
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:29,080
case that the city government can think

148
00:06:27,459 --> 00:06:31,149
for a moment that they have the right to

149
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:33,479
suppress unpopular political movements

150
00:06:31,149 --> 00:06:36,729
and use public resources to do it is

151
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:38,379
phenomenal and the the fact that the

152
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:40,930
City Attorney's Office was placed on

153
00:06:38,379 --> 00:06:43,449
notice repeatedly by letters from Paul

154
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:45,009
Loney and letters from me that this was

155
00:06:43,449 --> 00:06:46,959
happening took no action to do anything

156
00:06:45,009 --> 00:06:49,449
about it the fact that the City Council

157
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:51,750
took no action to do anything about it

158
00:06:49,449 --> 00:06:55,569
ends up making the city liable for

159
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:57,519
extensive damages for extensive

160
00:06:55,569 --> 00:07:00,459
attorneys cost

161
00:06:57,519 --> 00:07:02,079
in a situation that we were astonished

162
00:07:00,459 --> 00:07:03,669
would actually have developed this far

163
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:05,409
we would have thought that when a police

164
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:07,330
officer arrest somebody and says up

165
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:08,410
front to the press I arrested him

166
00:07:07,329 --> 00:07:09,789
because I don't agree with what he

167
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:11,500
stands for and we're gonna stop his

168
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:12,939
political movement that the city

169
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,019
government would respond immediately and

170
00:07:12,939 --> 00:07:16,389
say this is totally out of bounds

171
00:07:14,019 --> 00:07:18,310
totally unconstitutional totally illegal

172
00:07:16,389 --> 00:07:19,719
and the city attorney in the City

173
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:21,699
Council whoever would have said to the

174
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:24,730
Chief of Police stop this activity

175
00:07:21,699 --> 00:07:25,779
instead they've supported it said the

176
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:28,870
right thing right

177
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:31,779
that's pretty outrageous so the Ninth

178
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:34,780
Circuit will hear the appeals March the

179
00:07:31,779 --> 00:07:36,669
fifth and then we have to wait for them

180
00:07:34,779 --> 00:07:38,409
to issue a ruling which I think we're

181
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:40,180
fairly confident is going to reverse the

182
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:42,939
dismissals and return the cases for

183
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:44,379
trial the Ninth Circuit is moving a

184
00:07:42,939 --> 00:07:45,879
little slower than normal these days

185
00:07:44,379 --> 00:07:48,100
because the Republicans in Congress

186
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:49,930
won't confirm judges for the Ninth

187
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:52,660
Circuit so they're short about a third

188
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:55,389
of their judges but we would hope we'd

189
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:57,340
have a ruling perhaps somewhere near the

190
00:07:55,389 --> 00:08:00,310
end of the year in September October of

191
00:07:57,339 --> 00:08:03,359
98 we'd have a ruling and be back down

192
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:07,000
at the district court level and then

193
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:09,610
make the city work yeah yeah it's just

194
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,860
like you say that you know the fact that

195
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:13,540
the sings I've gone this far I mean it's

196
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:16,300
just shocking that they you know it's

197
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:17,830
costing the taxpayers all this money to

198
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:20,050
defend a case which you know should have

199
00:08:17,829 --> 00:08:21,729
never gone on you know what the Ninth

200
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:23,439
Circuit's coming to hear any other cases

201
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:24,939
or is this thing no the Ninth Circuit is

202
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:27,850
here for a whole group of cases and they

203
00:08:24,939 --> 00:08:29,800
will be sitting here during that week of

204
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:31,689
March the 5th Monday through Friday

205
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:34,720
they'll be in Portland they come up to

206
00:08:31,689 --> 00:08:36,789
listen to cases that where the parties

207
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:38,050
are in Oregon to make it convenient for

208
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:43,149
the party so they don't all have to come

209
00:08:38,049 --> 00:08:46,240
to San Francisco and I I do know that

210
00:08:43,149 --> 00:08:48,549
the the Ninth Circuit recent rulings on

211
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:51,580
the Civil Rights Act have been fairly

212
00:08:48,549 --> 00:08:54,429
closely aligned with our arguments to

213
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:56,500
the Ninth Circuit this is an act that

214
00:08:54,429 --> 00:08:58,509
was designed to prevent the suppression

215
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:00,070
of unpopular political movements it came

216
00:08:58,509 --> 00:09:03,250
out of the time when the Ku Klux Klan

217
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:05,890
was in control or very influential over

218
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:08,379
southern governments at it right after

219
00:09:05,889 --> 00:09:10,659
the slaves had been released and the law

220
00:09:08,379 --> 00:09:11,289
was written to protect both ex slaves

221
00:09:10,659 --> 00:09:13,299
who

222
00:09:11,289 --> 00:09:16,088
trying to gain their full citizenship

223
00:09:13,299 --> 00:09:18,729
rights and the Republican Party which at

224
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:20,500
that time was trying to help the

225
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:22,839
afro-american population of the South

226
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:24,339
achieve full citizenship it's a very

227
00:09:22,839 --> 00:09:27,459
different Republican Party today

228
00:09:24,339 --> 00:09:29,019
obviously so the law was designed both

229
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:31,179
to protect people suffering

230
00:09:29,019 --> 00:09:34,360
discrimination and to protect political

231
00:09:31,179 --> 00:09:35,979
groups in an unpopular situation where

232
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:38,800
they were suffering from official

233
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:41,560
repression so we view the case as really

234
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:43,000
the anti him performing movement having

235
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:45,458
taken over the government of Portland

236
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,289
and the Pro hemp reform movement

237
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:49,328
suffering from official government

238
00:09:47,289 --> 00:09:51,879
repression by this party that's taken

239
00:09:49,328 --> 00:09:54,549
power and that that's a classic model

240
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:57,549
for applying the civil rights law yeah

241
00:09:54,549 --> 00:09:58,990
it certainly seems to me that you know

242
00:09:57,549 --> 00:10:01,059
there anybody you know the city

243
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:04,690
government has said that anybody who's

244
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:06,939
out to reform the hemp laws is fair game

245
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:08,500
for the police department and I think

246
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:11,230
it's important for people in Portland to

247
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:13,028
realize however you feel about him if

248
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:13,750
they can do this to the hemp reform

249
00:10:13,028 --> 00:10:16,179
movement today

250
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:18,669
they can do it to you tomorrow whatever

251
00:10:16,179 --> 00:10:20,620
your particular cause maybe if it's

252
00:10:18,669 --> 00:10:22,750
unpopular with those who hold power and

253
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:25,028
control the police department and what

254
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:27,879
we're talking about is repeated arrests

255
00:10:25,028 --> 00:10:30,370
a seizure materials we have it's this

256
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:32,379
glorious First Amendment incident with

257
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:35,078
the Mount Tabor pub which at the time

258
00:10:32,379 --> 00:10:38,139
was owned and operated by mark meek and

259
00:10:35,078 --> 00:10:39,969
had a temporary liquor license they came

260
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:42,068
to him with the presidents of two

261
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:44,019
neighborhood associations the police

262
00:10:42,068 --> 00:10:46,059
officer that is the liaison to the State

263
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:48,009
Liquor Commission and the city employee

264
00:10:46,059 --> 00:10:50,138
that's in charge of liquor licenses and

265
00:10:48,009 --> 00:10:52,059
they told him that he had to take down

266
00:10:50,139 --> 00:10:53,589
the handbills that were posted in the

267
00:10:52,059 --> 00:10:55,509
neighborhood for something called hemp

268
00:10:53,589 --> 00:10:57,880
Awareness Week which was going to be an

269
00:10:55,509 --> 00:11:00,399
event at Mount Tabor they had he had to

270
00:10:57,879 --> 00:11:03,250
take the word hemp off of the marquee of

271
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:05,528
the Mount Tabor pub and that he had to

272
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:08,649
prevent Floyd Landreth from speaking at

273
00:11:05,528 --> 00:11:11,259
the event to be held there so the word

274
00:11:08,649 --> 00:11:12,938
hemp itself had become their target and

275
00:11:11,259 --> 00:11:15,370
they didn't want the word displayed in

276
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:17,588
public leaflets are on the marquee and

277
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:18,759
the police and city officials were there

278
00:11:17,589 --> 00:11:21,250
with the Neighborhood Association

279
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:24,580
leadership to say you can't use this

280
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:28,389
word it's just a phenomenal incident

281
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:30,759
First Amendment violation being all too

282
00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:34,980
often the marijuana prohibition is used

283
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:38,470
to expand police intrusion and

284
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:40,149
desecration of our civil rights so you

285
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:42,370

00:12:40,629 --> 00:12:47,679
30s

307
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:49,750
a USDA World War 2 movie from 43 called

308
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:52,989
hemp for victory literally there's over

309
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:54,820
50 different videos available there so

310
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:58,839
if you've got a modem you can watch

311
00:12:54,820 --> 00:13:02,020
those so back to the case they're you

312
00:12:58,839 --> 00:13:04,360
know landing you you worked with the

313
00:13:02,019 --> 00:13:06,009
Christic Institute in Washington right

314
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:08,560
didn't you so you were the director of

315
00:13:06,009 --> 00:13:11,889
litigation for that and helped publicize

316
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:13,419
some of the iran-contra I was I was

317
00:13:11,889 --> 00:13:16,029
there for five years and we worked on

318
00:13:13,419 --> 00:13:18,429
the iran-contra case and that it's it's

319
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:20,259
again the same issue it's do we have a

320
00:13:18,429 --> 00:13:21,939
democracy in this country do we have a

321
00:13:20,259 --> 00:13:23,620
republic in this country where the power

322
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:26,200
remains with the people even when they

323
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:28,509
delegate it to the government or is the

324
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:31,089
government up for grabs by those that

325
00:13:28,509 --> 00:13:33,458
have their own private agenda for world

326
00:13:31,089 --> 00:13:36,430
domination economic down

327
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:38,138
whatever it's the government they're

328
00:13:36,429 --> 00:13:39,519
going to be their tool regardless of

329
00:13:38,139 --> 00:13:42,009
what the people want or what the people

330
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:45,278
think and the war on drugs is Paul

331
00:13:42,009 --> 00:13:48,940
Stanford mentioned has become a tool for

332
00:13:45,278 --> 00:13:50,620
political repression I think if you you

333
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:52,779
can even move it up into the spiritual

334
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:55,419
realm in looking at a lot of the things

335
00:13:52,778 --> 00:13:59,559
going on around the world and to the

336
00:13:55,419 --> 00:14:01,028
planet on the planet I think that part

337
00:13:59,559 --> 00:14:03,489
of the reason there's a marijuana

338
00:14:01,028 --> 00:14:05,409
suppression movement is that for some

339
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:07,419
people not for all people but for some

340
00:14:05,409 --> 00:14:09,188
people the experience of smoking

341
00:14:07,419 --> 00:14:10,479
marijuana has brought them closer to

342
00:14:09,188 --> 00:14:12,429
identifying with the earth and

343
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,230
connecting to the earth and that the

344
00:14:12,429 --> 00:14:15,849
more you identify and connect with the

345
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:19,259
earth the more you are prepared to

346
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:21,430
oppose the corporate programs for

347
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:23,680
dismantling the earth consuming the

348
00:14:21,429 --> 00:14:26,878
earth not chewing it up polluting it all

349
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:29,109
those things and that therefore that

350
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:31,300
experience represents a danger to

351
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:33,430
corporate domination of the planet and

352
00:14:31,299 --> 00:14:36,068
that the marijuana suppression movement

353
00:14:33,429 --> 00:14:37,719
is in part motivated by a spiritual

354
00:14:36,068 --> 00:14:39,789
worship of the death of the planet

355
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:41,649
versus those that relate to the life of

356
00:14:39,789 --> 00:14:44,679
the planet and it can take that

357
00:14:41,649 --> 00:14:46,778
dimension so that only through an

358
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:49,588
ability to articulate those kind of

359
00:14:46,778 --> 00:14:52,028
things to approach people with why

360
00:14:49,589 --> 00:14:53,680
marijuana should be legalized regulated

361
00:14:52,028 --> 00:14:56,198
whatever approach you want to take and

362
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:59,169
have the right to speak and convince

363
00:14:56,198 --> 00:15:00,698
people can we stop this death worshiping

364
00:14:59,169 --> 00:15:03,370
corporate culture from devouring the

365
00:15:00,698 --> 00:15:05,469
planet and they know that we know that

366
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:06,938
and the American political system the

367
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:09,490
United States political system was

368
00:15:06,938 --> 00:15:11,559
supposedly designed so that ideas would

369
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:14,049
compete with each other in an impartial

370
00:15:11,559 --> 00:15:16,448
neutral playing field and in fact that's

371
00:15:14,049 --> 00:15:18,758
not what's happening the city of

372
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:21,429
Portland has taken sides and put public

373
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:23,620
resources on one side of the issue and

374
00:15:21,429 --> 00:15:25,269
we hope that this lawsuit will stop them

375
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:27,698
and others we hope that coming out of

376
00:15:25,269 --> 00:15:29,549
this lawsuit people trying to campaign

377
00:15:27,698 --> 00:15:32,019
on the hemp issue will be viewed as

378
00:15:29,549 --> 00:15:33,458
deserving the protection of the Civil

379
00:15:32,019 --> 00:15:35,799
Rights Act and that that will be useful

380
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:38,049
to people all over the country if we can

381
00:15:35,799 --> 00:15:41,078
get that kind of ruling yeah I just want

382
00:15:38,049 --> 00:15:43,448
to go back for a second to you know you

383
00:15:41,078 --> 00:15:44,528
set up with the spiritual realm but for

384
00:15:43,448 --> 00:15:47,919
some people who

385
00:15:44,528 --> 00:15:49,328
partake of marijuana they it affords him

386
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:51,669
a closer connection with the planet

387
00:15:49,328 --> 00:15:54,489
Earth which would make sense when you

388
00:15:51,669 --> 00:15:58,448
stop and look at the the history of

389
00:15:54,490 --> 00:16:01,688
humans as a race as a separate species

390
00:15:58,448 --> 00:16:03,998
one of the first plants that scientists

391
00:16:01,688 --> 00:16:07,539
agree that was domesticated by humans

392
00:16:03,999 --> 00:16:09,100
was you know the cannabis plant and so

393
00:16:07,539 --> 00:16:11,620
that was you know at the time when we

394
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:12,999
had a much closer connection to the

395
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:16,360
planet so that was one of the first

396
00:16:12,999 --> 00:16:18,939
plants that we realized was sacred to us

397
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:21,490
and have many uses and so therefore it

398
00:16:18,938 --> 00:16:23,110
even today it kind of relates for people

399
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:25,778
some people like I say it relates back

400
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:28,449
to that point we have over in Hawaii we

401
00:16:25,778 --> 00:16:32,198
have a church that has been set up

402
00:16:28,448 --> 00:16:34,179
around the hemp plant and they've been

403
00:16:32,198 --> 00:16:36,758
various cases brought there's a

404
00:16:34,179 --> 00:16:39,998
prosecution now underway of the chief

405
00:16:36,759 --> 00:16:42,220
minister of that church and the the

406
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:48,490
higher courts had not upheld it as a

407
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:49,629
spiritual practice to use hip I suspect

408
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:51,100
that's eventually going to go to the

409
00:16:49,629 --> 00:16:53,709
United States Supreme Court and there'll

410
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:57,308
be different rulings we'll see what

411
00:16:53,708 --> 00:17:01,119
happens but I think there is a spiritual

412
00:16:57,308 --> 00:17:02,980
dimension we're fortunate in living in

413
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,959
Hawaii we have such a high spiritual

414
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:09,370
content in the very atmosphere we live

415
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:11,409
in on a daily basis that stimulants are

416
00:17:09,369 --> 00:17:13,538
hardly necessary for other people

417
00:17:11,409 --> 00:17:15,309
however and other environments I think

418
00:17:13,538 --> 00:17:17,048
find it useful as a way of breaking

419
00:17:15,308 --> 00:17:19,808
through barriers that are set up by a

420
00:17:17,048 --> 00:17:21,730
highly intellectualized culture where we

421
00:17:19,808 --> 00:17:24,009
get so up in our minds that we lose

422
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:26,769
touch with the flowers and the trees and

423
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:29,140
the Dolphins and whatever and then it

424
00:17:26,769 --> 00:17:31,960
offers an opportunity and basically the

425
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:33,309
bottom line is if you're engaged in

426
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,808
something that's not harming someone

427
00:17:33,308 --> 00:17:36,250
else it's not the state's business to

428
00:17:34,808 --> 00:17:38,408
tell you yea or nay

429
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:42,009
those are your decisions and what we

430
00:17:38,409 --> 00:17:43,960
call victimless crimes we have people

431
00:17:42,009 --> 00:17:47,169
who have used victimless crimes as a

432
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:49,058
tool to enact repressive laws and gain

433
00:17:47,169 --> 00:17:50,980
more power over people and make people

434
00:17:49,058 --> 00:17:52,538
afraid and the more you make people

435
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:54,490
afraid about one thing the more you make

436
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:55,929
them afraid about another and the more

437
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,849
you can get them to act out of fear

438
00:17:55,929 --> 00:17:59,550
rather

439
00:17:56,849 --> 00:18:01,349
of love or a higher purpose the more you

440
00:17:59,549 --> 00:18:03,960
get them to conform to a police state

441
00:18:01,349 --> 00:18:08,129
mentality yeah well yeah it relates back

442
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:09,539
to which our lawsuit you know you know

443
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:11,820
with a civil rights case for hemp

444
00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:13,619
activist because the Civil Rights Act

445
00:18:11,819 --> 00:18:15,389
khaki said came out of four you know

446
00:18:13,619 --> 00:18:17,699
Forex slaves and Republicans trying to

447
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:19,650
help them you know it was a sort of like

448
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,880
a status if you were a slave you know

449
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:22,890
you could be a press and that's what

450
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,570
they were trying to stop you know it's

451
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:27,300
the same thing now you know if like if

452
00:18:24,569 --> 00:18:29,220
you happen to be a campaigner for the

453
00:18:27,299 --> 00:18:31,470
change of hemp laws you can be oppressed

454
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:32,910
and it's a very good point we must

455
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:34,710
remember to make that point to the Ninth

456
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:36,390
Circuit and it's almost the status

457
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:38,279
offense yeah yes if you're a hemp

458
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:39,810
activist your favorite game yeah you

459
00:18:38,279 --> 00:18:41,639
know what no other political movement

460
00:18:39,809 --> 00:18:43,769
has to deal with that no you know I'm

461

activists across the state and no other

463
00:18:46,549 --> 00:18:53,039
political movement has to deal with the

464
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:55,920
paranoia that our supporters deal with

465
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:59,490
you know I would say only one out of

466

there now our opponents are yeah but our

470

opponents say that you know that doesn't

471
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:14,400
exist but in fact paranoia is one of the

472
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:17,039
things that scares a lot of people from

473

talking about flowers just a moment ago

484
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:51,809
and and the spiritual use of cannabis

485
00:19:49,109 --> 00:19:56,490
you know and how that contributes to

486
00:19:51,809 --> 00:19:58,319
corporate death culture the the whole

487
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:59,789
thing with industrial hemp right now in

488
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:01,259
several countries they're starting

489
00:19:59,789 --> 00:20:03,329
including Canada this year they're

490
00:20:01,259 --> 00:20:06,299
starting to allow commercial cultivation

491
00:20:03,329 --> 00:20:10,908
of him but they limit the THC level

492
00:20:06,299 --> 00:20:15,298
that's in the hemp plants to 0.3

493
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:18,360
a three tenths of 1% THC now by doing

494
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:20,369
that the only way you can limit a hemp

495
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:22,798
plant or a marijuana plant to that low a

496
00:20:20,369 --> 00:20:25,859
level of THC is you got to breed it

497
00:20:22,798 --> 00:20:27,990
breed out the flowers if you breed out

498
00:20:25,859 --> 00:20:30,658
the flowers you don't have to as much

499
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:33,089
THC because there's more THC in the

500
00:20:30,659 --> 00:20:36,120
resin now by breeding out the flowers

501
00:20:33,089 --> 00:20:38,459
that means it doesn't have seeds and if

502
00:20:36,119 --> 00:20:41,729
you don't have an industrial hemp crop

503
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:44,940
with the low THC strains only produce

504
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:47,669
about 600 pounds of seeds while a Notre

505
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:49,500
Dame study in 75 on the wild hemp fields

506
00:20:47,669 --> 00:20:52,350
of southern Illinois show that those

507
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:55,769
wild hemp fields produce over 4 tons of

508
00:20:52,349 --> 00:20:57,569
seeds per acre now you take that 4

509
00:20:55,769 --> 00:21:00,119
tonnes of seed and you press it you get

510
00:20:57,569 --> 00:21:03,779
over 700 gallons of oil that will drive

511
00:21:00,119 --> 00:21:06,029
any diesel engine and that I believe is

512
00:21:03,779 --> 00:21:08,339
another key reason that hemp is

513
00:21:06,029 --> 00:21:10,940
prohibited is because the petrochemical

514
00:21:08,339 --> 00:21:14,250
industries don't want to deal with

515
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:17,700
biodiesel and hemp produces more than

516
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:19,380
three times more biodiesel or vegetable

517
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:21,840
oil fuel which doesn't take any

518
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:24,179
conversion at all to run an internal

519
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:24,509
combustion diesel engine probably smells

520
00:21:24,179 --> 00:21:26,250
better

521
00:21:24,509 --> 00:21:32,089
it smells like french fries it smells

522
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:32,089
much much better and so it's not toxic

523
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:38,370
nutritional qualities as well and when

524
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:40,230
it goes rancid at when it's not a good

525
00:21:38,369 --> 00:21:42,298
food anymore it's a good fuel it's a

526
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:44,460
good fuel right yeah that's that's a

527
00:21:42,298 --> 00:21:46,079
very good point you know is it and it's

528
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:48,870
in this kind of it's really interesting

529
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:50,668
now is that why they're saying that it

530
00:21:48,869 --> 00:21:52,529
should only be you know this industrial

531
00:21:50,669 --> 00:21:54,809
hemp could be with you know with no

532
00:21:52,529 --> 00:21:57,329
flowering tops I mean I don't know it

533
00:21:54,808 --> 00:21:59,099
just you know these call me crazy but

534
00:21:57,329 --> 00:22:00,449
seems kind of cruel to a plant not to

535
00:21:59,099 --> 00:22:02,879
allow it to get to the flower you know

536
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:05,100
point because these industrial you know

537
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:07,409
are these wild hemp fields and and you

538
00:22:05,099 --> 00:22:09,538
know Kansas you know Nebraska Southern

539
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:11,580
Illinois I mean that's still low tea yes

540
00:22:09,538 --> 00:22:14,250
it's really like one and a half percent

541
00:22:11,579 --> 00:22:16,199
which is still not psychoactive on to

542
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:17,819
limit it so that the petrochemical

543
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:20,130
industries don't have to compete that's

544
00:22:17,819 --> 00:22:23,189
the only real reason there can be well

545
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:23,730
when you go back to the original making

546
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:26,910
of him

547
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:29,579
illegal and the campaign to make it

548
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:32,250
illegal than the the petrochemical

549
00:22:29,579 --> 00:22:34,500
industry and the pharmaceutical industry

550
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:35,940
involving themselves in that campaign

551
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:38,849
because hemp was coming on so strong

552
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:41,670
right exactly and the cotton growing

553
00:22:38,849 --> 00:22:44,279
states - there's new machinery that made

554
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:46,710
him a fraction of its former price it

555
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:49,200
dropped a hundredfold from fifty cents a

556
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:51,240
ton down to a half a cent a time and so

557
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,430
suddenly it was competitive and they had

558
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:55,799
to stop it it's important to know these

559
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:58,410
kinds of historical facts because much

560
00:22:55,799 --> 00:23:01,619
of what is being done now having been

561
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:04,680
based originally on a lie and based on

562
00:23:01,619 --> 00:23:07,829
an economic motivations has led to a

563
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:09,960
continuing propaganda campaign with a

564
00:23:07,829 --> 00:23:12,899
lot of lies a lot of fear a lot of

565
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:15,720
manipulation when in fact underlying it

566
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:17,340
is often a very strong political agenda

567
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:20,420
that the partnership for a drug-free

568
00:23:17,339 --> 00:23:22,500
America heavily funded by alcohol and

569
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:25,170
pharmaceutical pharmaceutical injures

570
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:27,509
back or tobacco these are people who

571
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:29,880
would be harmed by hemp being allowed to

572
00:23:27,509 --> 00:23:31,529
compete with them they don't have they

573
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,760
know the truth and they don't care about

574
00:23:31,529 --> 00:23:34,649
the truth what they care about is

575
00:23:32,759 --> 00:23:36,029
protecting their economic interests well

576
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:37,980
you like you say you know remember in

577
00:23:36,029 --> 00:23:40,859
history is very important now you know

578
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:42,539
you hear it said about other you know

579
00:23:40,859 --> 00:23:44,159
civil rights movements out there is like

580
00:23:42,539 --> 00:23:46,769
one of the first things and oppress

581
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:48,090
people losses is their history in a

582
00:23:46,769 --> 00:23:50,279
sense one of the first things that we

583
00:23:48,089 --> 00:23:52,259
lost as marijuana activists and

584
00:23:50,279 --> 00:23:54,059
advocates you know we've long we lost

585
00:23:52,259 --> 00:23:56,279
our history and there's only thanks to

586
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:57,839
some people like Jack Herer going back

587
00:23:56,279 --> 00:23:59,819
over here doing a research we were able

588
00:23:57,839 --> 00:24:01,859
to bring back up all this wonderful

589
00:23:59,819 --> 00:24:03,929
information about hemp and marijuana

590
00:24:01,859 --> 00:24:05,699
what the name of that book the Emperor

591
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:06,960
wears no clothes no clothes you know I

592
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:11,880
mean they're sedition that was written

593
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:14,160
in my house way back in 85 but I want to

594
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:15,870
remind people to call us I always have

595

599
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:30,180
hope you can come back for the next show

600
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:32,190
as well for next week's episode but I'd

601
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:33,720
like to talk a little bit more about the

602
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:36,380
court case and some of the incidents

603
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:39,680
regarding our initiative that

604
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:41,360
this civil rights suit that the federal

605
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:46,940
9th Circuit Court of Appeals is coming

606
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:48,829
here to Portland to hear this week when

607
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:51,980
they when we first announced we were

608
00:24:48,829 --> 00:24:53,689
going to have this petition drive the

609
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:55,220
only opposition they had in the media

610
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:57,500
was from the police and several police

611
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:59,690
agencies came forward and even after

612
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:02,450
this suit as recently as a town hall

613
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:05,840
show that was filmed recently by local

614
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:08,960
KATU TV the police come forward and and

615
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:11,449
oppose our initiative and are using

616
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,980
their there in uniform you know and

617
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:15,950
they're there they're there

618
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:18,589
in fact when I went on town hall I had a

619
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:22,759
DEA agent sitting next to me and next to

620
00:25:18,589 --> 00:25:26,000
him was a captain in the NARC Portland

621
00:25:22,759 --> 00:25:28,190
Police Drug and Vice unit and then

622
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,890
another Oregon state trooper they're the

623
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:33,140
main people up front and center opposing

624
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:35,240
us and that has a very chilling effect

625
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:37,490
on our activists like I said we only get

626
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:39,740
one out of three people who say they

627
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:42,950
want to sign sign our petition because

628
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:45,049
they say they're afraid and the there

629
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:47,330
they're trying to escalate that fear by

630
00:25:45,049 --> 00:25:48,889
coming out and being our main opponents

631
00:25:47,329 --> 00:25:51,439
part of what people need to understand

632
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:55,309
in the constitutional dimension of this

633
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:56,470
case one of the elements article 4 of

634
00:25:55,308 --> 00:25:58,579
the United States Constitution

635
00:25:56,470 --> 00:26:02,450
guarantees a Republican form of

636
00:25:58,579 --> 00:26:04,970
government what that means is that you

637
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:07,069
may delegate power to a representative

638
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:09,079
government but the representative

639
00:26:07,069 --> 00:26:11,629
government still must acknowledge that

640
00:26:09,079 --> 00:26:14,058
the power resides and the people so that

641
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:16,400
the forces of government the resources

642
00:26:14,058 --> 00:26:18,950
of government are only to be used on an

643
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,570
impartial basis regarding the general

644
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:22,490
public they are not to be put at the

645
00:26:20,569 --> 00:26:25,490
service of any one faction within the

646
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:28,039
community so when you see police

647
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:29,808
officers in uniform that the the case

648
00:26:28,039 --> 00:26:32,928
where we were seeking the injunction

649
00:26:29,808 --> 00:26:34,910
started when the the last initiative was

650
00:26:32,929 --> 00:26:37,309
announced to change the the hemp laws

651
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:39,110
and the television stations went to the

652
00:26:37,308 --> 00:26:41,119
police station and out came officer

653
00:26:39,109 --> 00:26:43,609
Jensen who was the official spokesman

654
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:45,829
for the police department in uniform

655
00:26:43,609 --> 00:26:47,449
making a statement denigrating the

656
00:26:45,829 --> 00:26:48,639
motives of the people who were putting

657
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:51,370
forward this initiative

658
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:53,650
discouraging people from signing it that

659
00:26:51,369 --> 00:26:55,839
was a use of his official position which

660
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:58,090
he's paid for by all the tax payers

661
00:26:55,839 --> 00:27:01,298
those are pro him anti hemp or neutral

662
00:26:58,089 --> 00:27:03,220
are all paying his salary and he's using

663
00:27:01,298 --> 00:27:06,099
his position and that's publicly paid

664
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:08,860
time to take a partisan position on an

665
00:27:06,099 --> 00:27:11,019
initiative that that's against state law

666
00:27:08,859 --> 00:27:13,389
in Oregon but more fundamentally it's

667
00:27:11,019 --> 00:27:15,400
unconstitutional that when you when the

668
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:18,070
government is allowed to use public

669
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:21,009
resources to present only one side of an

670
00:27:18,069 --> 00:27:23,200
issue or to appear as Paul's just

671
00:27:21,009 --> 00:27:25,779
talking about in opposition to another

672
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:27,548
side of an issue you have a very big

673
00:27:25,779 --> 00:27:29,769
constitutional problem on your hands

674
00:27:27,548 --> 00:27:32,079
because as we said about the earlier

675
00:27:29,769 --> 00:27:33,849
violations of civil rights if they can

676
00:27:32,079 --> 00:27:36,099
do that to the hemp movement today they

677
00:27:33,849 --> 00:27:38,379
can do it to you tomorrow if you want to

678
00:27:36,099 --> 00:27:41,619
put up an initiative for anything and

679
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:43,690
the official state policy is to oppose

680
00:27:41,619 --> 00:27:46,209
you and they can put state officials on

681
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:48,789
state time into a debate with you spend

682
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:52,900
state money to oppose you then it's a

683
00:27:48,789 --> 00:27:55,629
one-sided campaign it's not a even of a

684
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:58,330
level playing ground and this you really

685
00:27:55,630 --> 00:28:00,490
should not allow this and I would hope

686
00:27:58,329 --> 00:28:02,439
that people would tell the city of

687
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:04,240
Portland and the state police that they

688
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:06,970
should not be appearing in these kinds

689
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,539
of forums to campaign for one side of

690
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:09,669
the issue

691
00:28:07,539 --> 00:28:10,928
yeah that's it's definitely true you

692
00:28:09,669 --> 00:28:13,179
know the police have got to stay out of

693
00:28:10,929 --> 00:28:15,669
this it's a high state law it's like you

694
00:28:13,179 --> 00:28:17,259
say it's constitutional and we all got

695
00:28:15,669 --> 00:28:21,040
to stand up for that and tell them no

696
00:28:17,259 --> 00:28:23,289
when ever see them on TV but thanks for
