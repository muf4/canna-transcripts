1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,519
we are

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:06,000
navigating the waters at the department

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:08,080
of agriculture and looking at developing

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,240
rules and so we're very interested in

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:13,679
learning from those that

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:15,679
have experience in industrial hemp and

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,199
how we can make the rules here in the

8
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,600
state

9
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:21,600
common sense and work for farmers and

10
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,560
handlers so i'll just give a little

11
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,560
overview of

12
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,000
the history kind of where we are in

13
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:30,479
oregon

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,839
senator perzansky's bill as eric

15
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,359
mentioned um

16
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:36,799
passed the oregon legislature in 2009

17
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:38,479
um and

18
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:40,399
i think we've talked about it and most

19
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:42,398
of you in the room are familiar

20
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:43,759
the department of agriculture did not

21
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:46,399
move forward at that time in

22
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:48,558
promulgating rules because of the

23
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,719
quasi-legal status

24
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:53,839
there was some concern that given the

25
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:55,840
controlled substances act and the need

26
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,840
for a dea permit

27
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,559
and the

28
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:04,719
illegality in most cases for you to grow

29
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:06,640
hemp we didn't want to be licensing

30
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:08,239
farmers to be able to grow it if it was

31
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,960
putting them in

32
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:13,199
jeopardy under federal law as well as us

33
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:14,000
as the state agency

34
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,240
so

35
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,920
when the washington and colorado

36
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:21,759
electorates

37
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,439
passed their legislation last year we

38
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,799
put together an internal team to start

39
00:01:23,438 --> 00:01:28,158
looking at if we had

40
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,159
medical marijuana we have medical

41
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:32,240
marijuana in oregon if we had

42
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,799
marijuana for personal use that would be

43
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:37,359
legalized in oregon would that change

44
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:40,640
what we could do and then we saw the

45
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:42,719
august 29th department of justice memo

46
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,478
that a congressman

47
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:46,959
mentioned that had

48
00:01:44,478 --> 00:01:47,840
what how states can move forward and the

49
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:51,519
eight

50
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:53,520
kind of principles for a robust

51
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:55,438
enforcement system that the department

52
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:56,640
of justice would be

53
00:01:55,438 --> 00:01:59,758
expecting

54
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:02,000
and so we've looked at that and we've

55
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:05,438
been looking at moving forward

56
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:09,840
and so we where we are now is we've kind

57
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:09,840
of developed a rules advisory committee

58
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:14,400
like i said we

59
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:16,639
will in any legislation that we do or

60
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,080
not legislation sorry in any rule making

61
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:20,000
that we do

62
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:23,040
we always want to make sure that it's

63
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,560
going to be applicable and common sense

64
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:30,239
for the actual producers and handlers so

65
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:34,640
the the oregon law focuses on licensing

66
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:36,560
and permitting of growers and handlers

67
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:39,199
i brought a copy of it but i don't know

68
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,360
most of you have probably seen it

69
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:43,919
and i can certainly provide i can

70
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,360
certainly provide copies um if you guys

71
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:46,878
need it

72
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,040
but the essential

73
00:02:46,878 --> 00:02:51,518
elements of the way the oregon statute

74
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:53,120
reads is that it asks the department of

75
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:56,640
agriculture to

76
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:59,280
license on a three-year basis

77
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:01,439
growers and handlers

78
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,000
of industrial hemp and so

79
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:06,560
what that means is obviously growers i

80
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,719
think is a self-explanatory

81
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,560
piece but handlers would be

82
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:12,400
the first handler the person who would

83
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,039
be receiving the raw agricultural

84
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,599
product and processing it

85
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:20,318
as the congressman mentioned processed

86
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:21,679
hemp products are legal for interstate

87
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:23,518
commerce

88
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,560
and there's not an issue there but it's

89
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,760
the

90
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,719
seed

91
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:30,158
going to a processor who can process it

92
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:32,318
for oil

93
00:03:30,158 --> 00:03:34,079
that would have to be licensed um and

94
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:36,000
then there's also a permitting process

95
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,000
also a three-year permit

96
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,639
that would um

97
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,799
allow seed dealers so that we could have

98
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:46,318
see the

99
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:47,840
viable seed be able to be grown sold for

100
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:49,518
growing

101
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,479
currently under controlled substances

102
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:54,158
act only sterilized c so that you

103
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:56,639
couldn't grow

104
00:03:54,158 --> 00:04:01,840
is allowed to be sold so that's

105
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:04,238
what the oregon law focuses on it also

106
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,560
the congressman mentioned the definition

107
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:09,599
of industrial health which is actually

108
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,959
in our state statute at the 0.3 percent

109
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:12,560
of thc

110
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,878
and so

111
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:18,720
there would have to be inspections uh

112
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:21,599
where we would take samples of the crop

113
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,880
um and test those for thc comment or

114
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,680
contents or

115
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:28,319
um and to to ensure that it was below

116
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:31,600
the 0.3 percent

117
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:34,240
um so that's what we're dealing with

118
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,120
and we'll be promulgating rules around

119
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,319
that

120
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:42,079
um the rules will kind of focus on

121
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:43,680
application for licenses what we need

122
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:45,439
to get for

123
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,918
in order to issue those licenses and

124
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:50,879
permits the inspection procedures

125
00:04:47,918 --> 00:04:52,240
sampling procedures how often at what

126
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:54,000
time

127
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,199
in the growing process would we need to

128
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,680
do that

129
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:01,199
obviously fees it would have to be a fee

130
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:03,280
supported program so we'll have to

131
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,600
look at the the physical impact of the

132
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:08,559
department as well as the users

133
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,160
and then also things like tolerances so

134
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,439
if 0.3

135
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,080
is

136
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:16,800
the definition in our statute

137
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:19,279
what is the tolerance as we test

138
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:23,280
and how you know how close can we test

139
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:25,198
it what um you know per million

140
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:27,119
level are we going down to and will we

141
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,879
need to go down to so those kinds of

142
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,439
things are what we'll be working on with

143
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:32,399
our rules advisory committee

144
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:34,319
we

145
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:36,879
have started to contact people for the

146
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:39,199
rules advisory committee the under

147
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:40,319
oregon state administrative procedures

148
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,120
law

149
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:43,038
that

150
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,280
directs us on how we develop

151
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:48,319
administrative rules rules advisory

152
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:50,239
committees are generally mostly for

153
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:52,879
fiscal impact

154
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:55,120
that's what they're supposed to be used

155
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:56,800
for but we will obviously be using

156
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,840
our committee and leaning on them

157
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,879
heavily

158
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:01,839
to help

159
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:05,360
in the practical application um in the

160
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:06,719
agronomic application and so we've

161
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:10,080
tried to get

162
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:12,479
a couple of growers a couple of handlers

163
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:14,879
the farm bureau we have a representative

164
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:17,918
from oregon present our organ senator

165
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:21,199
frazenski's office and osu we've asked

166
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:24,639
for us to be on the panel

167
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:26,319
so that we can have those experts weigh

168
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,918
in

169
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,600
and then as

170
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:33,120
as we meet with that committee and we're

171
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:35,439
hoping to do that in early december

172
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,840
then the rules process is such that we

173
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:40,639
would have an open comment period

174
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:43,279
um and a hearing potentially multiple

175
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:45,439
hearings if we feel the need to but we

176
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:47,599
put out the draft rules and then have an

177
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:50,319
open comment period where we would take

178
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,160
comments um review those comments and

179
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:55,360
see if any changes need to be made

180
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:57,280
before the rule went into effect so

181
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,160
we have said i think there was an

182
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:00,159
oregonian article

183
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:05,120
this week um that we're trying to we

184
00:07:03,038 --> 00:07:07,759
would like to have the rule in place by

185
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:10,079
the spring planning season that's a very

186
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:11,520
aggressive timeline and we'll be working

187
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:12,639
on that so

188
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:13,918
um

189
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:17,120
that's why we're getting started in

190
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:20,000
early december so um we should hopefully

191
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:22,560
we hope to have um rolls out for comment

192
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,720
um either definitely first quarter of

193
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:29,038
next year

194
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:31,199
i think that's mostly what i have um

195
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:33,199
oh sorry one more thing this is probably

196
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:35,199
our most important thing uh as part of

197
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,879
our rules advisory committee um one of

198
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,800
the things that we are looking for so if

199
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:40,399
anyone in this room knows of someone or

200
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,038
is somebody who

201
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:45,439
is a fiber handler a first handler of

202
00:07:43,038 --> 00:07:48,000
fiber we have a couple of

203
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:50,240
representatives on our committee that

204
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,918
are can do the oil

205
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,240
squeezing and

206
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:56,959
handling of the seed

207
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,120
but we don't have anyone at this point

208
00:07:56,959 --> 00:08:00,478
that can process the fiber we'd

209
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,000
certainly like to hear that point of

210
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:02,959
view because there's a lot of fiber as

211
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
we know

212
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:06,000
that'll be produced
