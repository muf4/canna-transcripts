1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,839
right there

2
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,340
I am

3
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:43,878
can I get the gym bag or McDonald's

4
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:57,500
during times of shadow

5
00:00:57,659 --> 00:01:06,179
in the background of burst

6
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:09,260
Sun waits for the Moon

7
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:13,100
to torch tonight

8
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:13,100
to torch the night

9
00:01:13,459 --> 00:01:19,938
and the broken Neon

10
00:01:16,579 --> 00:01:23,280
and Faded light

11
00:01:19,938 --> 00:01:25,379
the lucky Motel

12
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:29,239
at the corner

13
00:01:25,379 --> 00:01:34,199
of nowhere and the past

14
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:37,519
where memories go to forget

15
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,519
to forget

16
00:01:38,118 --> 00:01:42,379
laughing

17
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,460
to erase

18
00:01:42,379 --> 00:01:46,759
her name

19
00:01:44,459 --> 00:01:49,798
is lease

20
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:53,180

21
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:53,180

his name is want

23
00:01:57,019 --> 00:02:01,759
she can hear it

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,200
she wants one

25
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:06,200
but doesn't want to

26
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:11,700
Sparks of the Stars

27
00:02:09,659 --> 00:02:13,919
burnings

28
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:17,479
strong

29
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:20,639
he is like flame

30
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:26,759
as her fire awaits

31
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:30,619
she is a pulse a pulse in the charging

32
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:32,659
light as a passion of storm

33
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:37,159
fiery rain

34
00:02:32,659 --> 00:02:37,159
lightning carries Thunder

35
00:03:08,659 --> 00:03:12,378
thank you

36
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:35,340
she's a good girl

37
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:38,340
coming to understand that sometimes this

38
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:43,098
is what good girls do

39
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:46,219
what good girls do in the breath of size

40
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:50,399
in the magic of moon

41
00:03:46,219 --> 00:03:52,318
they held them together so as not to

42
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:56,658
feel so alone

43
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:59,839
so alone so alone

44
00:03:56,658 --> 00:04:05,158
during times of shadow

45
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:06,239
in the background of verse the sun waits

46
00:04:05,158 --> 00:04:08,658
for the Moon

47
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:13,400
to torch tonight

48
00:04:08,658 --> 00:04:16,798
torch the night in the breath of songs

49
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:18,918
in a magic of moon

50
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:23,279
they held them together

51
00:04:18,918 --> 00:04:25,379
so as not to feel so alone

52
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:28,219
so alone

53
00:04:25,379 --> 00:04:28,219
so alone

54
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:59,660
um
