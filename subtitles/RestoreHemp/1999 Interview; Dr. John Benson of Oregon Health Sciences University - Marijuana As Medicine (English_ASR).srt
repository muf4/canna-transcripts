1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,759
the Israeli scientists because

2
00:00:02,939 --> 00:00:09,690
neutrophil not cool mccoullough Mikula

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:10,919
he's the one who discovered THC about 25

4
00:00:09,689 --> 00:00:12,509
years ago and then discovered the

5
00:00:10,919 --> 00:00:15,838
receptor sites or at least worked on the

6
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:17,839
team worked on those and has also been

7
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:21,899
involved in some of the endogenous

8
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:25,399
cannabinoids natural substances we all

9
00:00:21,899 --> 00:00:31,198
have in our brains and bodies as well

10
00:00:25,399 --> 00:00:35,450
still very active right are those coming

11
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:38,340
to endorphins or they're a different

12
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:42,620
group of chemicals also endogenous

13
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:45,210
though that use different receptors

14
00:00:42,619 --> 00:00:49,378
there are different receptors for the

15
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:54,929
opioids morphine and codeine those two

16
00:00:49,378 --> 00:00:59,759
substances so the endorphins are among

17
00:00:54,929 --> 00:01:02,670
these agents that help energize the

18
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:04,438
neurons to put out transmitters in

19
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:08,070
various centers of the brain and

20
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:12,618
cannabinoids or the components of the

21
00:01:08,069 --> 00:01:14,849
marijuana leaf are yet another system

22
00:01:12,618 --> 00:01:17,430
pharmacological system so that

23
00:01:14,849 --> 00:01:21,478
endogenous system I think they call it

24
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:24,868
the endorphin like substance in some

25
00:01:21,478 --> 00:01:30,289
Anatomy it's a Septon and amide yes the

26
00:01:24,868 --> 00:01:33,868
one that is best developed it also uses

27
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:38,520
the so called cb1 receptor cannabinoid

28
00:01:33,868 --> 00:01:43,430
one receptor and such as THC does and

29
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:47,670
then there's another one that's 2 AG

30
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:51,079
Iraq and Daniel glycerin Wow

31
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:55,799
which is another of these and endogenous

32
00:01:51,078 --> 00:02:00,149
cannabinoids like substances have they

33
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:02,799
identified the primary action of this

34
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:05,599
receptor system

35
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:08,959
there are many actions actually there

36
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:12,379
the receptors have been identified and

37
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:14,300
cloned actually and they can be cited or

38
00:02:12,379 --> 00:02:18,500
located in various parts of the brain

39
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:21,920
that had to do with pain perception with

40
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:26,709
movement control with control of

41
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:31,568
vomiting with warm and pleasant feelings

42
00:02:26,709 --> 00:02:35,390
with sedation and so forth so they're

43
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:40,000
common throughout the brain so that

44
00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:42,079
there is definite what should we say

45
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,939
therapeutic action of these substances

46
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:48,799
would that be well I mean that I

47
00:02:46,939 --> 00:02:51,829
wouldn't say the actions that you

48
00:02:48,799 --> 00:02:53,659
mentioned seemed to me to be therapeutic

49
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:55,910
in nature could be therapy but they

50
00:02:53,659 --> 00:02:58,519
might be exploited for therapeutic uses

51
00:02:55,909 --> 00:03:05,150
that's correct because there are these

52
00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:08,629
systems yes in place and that's the

53
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:11,299
reason I'm sure that people have found

54
00:03:08,629 --> 00:03:15,829
some utility for the use of these

55
00:03:11,299 --> 00:03:17,450
cannabinoid substances before the

56
00:03:15,829 --> 00:03:24,379
president of the Institute of Medicine

57
00:03:17,449 --> 00:03:25,759
asked you to be a co-investigator can

58
00:03:24,379 --> 00:03:28,090
you tell us about the process that led

59
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:33,169
up to the Institute of Medicine

60
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:35,239
conducting this inquiry yes the White

61
00:03:33,169 --> 00:03:38,179
House Office of National Drug Control

62
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:43,219
Policy which is directed by Barry

63
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:46,340
McCaffrey ask the Institute concept to

64
00:03:43,219 --> 00:03:50,900
consider such a study and was willing to

65
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:55,400
fund it about the same time a major

66
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:58,789
foundation also thought this would be

67
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:00,590
worthy of study but the Institute

68
00:03:58,789 --> 00:04:03,019
thought it better and so did it

69
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:05,870
apparently general McCaffrey

70
00:04:03,019 --> 00:04:10,189
if only the one sponsor were responsible

71
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:13,670
and so a proposal was made to the his

72
00:04:10,189 --> 00:04:16,250
office by the Institute staff

73
00:04:13,669 --> 00:04:21,370
which led to a statement of task so

74
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:24,050
called and then the funding of the study

75
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:26,120
what was the mandate from the Office of

76
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:28,129
National Drug Control Policy on that

77
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:30,800
didn't they exclude they just wanted the

78
00:04:28,129 --> 00:04:32,959
medical report nothing to do with

79
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,329
science sir well there's no that's the

80
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:37,549
science yes they wanted the scientific

81
00:04:35,329 --> 00:04:40,399
basis for any benefits or harms that

82
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:44,470
might come from the medical use of

83
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:49,129
marijuana or its component substances

84
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:52,630
and we were not restricted but we were

85
00:04:49,129 --> 00:04:57,290
not picked either to address issues of

86
00:04:52,629 --> 00:05:00,170
social legislative regulatory etcetera

87
00:04:57,290 --> 00:05:02,750
kinds of considerations I think it would

88
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:05,210
have been a very different statement of

89
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:07,579
tasks and a very different group but it

90
00:05:05,209 --> 00:05:08,959
would not have included me were you

91
00:05:07,579 --> 00:05:11,620
involved at all I know that the

92
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:15,589
Institute of Medicine produced to report

93
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:18,920
15 years before regarding marijuana not

94
00:05:15,589 --> 00:05:22,459
specifically as medicine there was

95
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:27,500
viewed that oh absolutely I was not that

96
00:05:22,459 --> 00:05:32,089
was in 1982 and it was frustrated by the

97
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:35,569
lack of clear science rigorous

98
00:05:32,089 --> 00:05:39,409
experimentation and called repeatedly

99
00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:43,310
for research in various fields in the

100
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:46,939
meantime there's been a explosion of

101
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:50,889
knowledge in the basic science field all

102
00:05:46,939 --> 00:05:53,420
of these an and amide and receptors and

103
00:05:50,889 --> 00:05:56,629
neurotransmitters and sighting of these

104
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:59,689
things and various control areas in the

105
00:05:56,629 --> 00:06:02,000
brain have been elaborated so we were at

106
00:05:59,689 --> 00:06:07,939
a distinct advantage over the people who

107
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:11,000
did that study and we hope we carried

108
00:06:07,939 --> 00:06:13,459
things a bit further because of that new

109
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:17,060
science could you address that explosion

110
00:06:13,459 --> 00:06:18,069
in science and discovery of the receptor

111
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:21,490
system and a bit

112
00:06:18,069 --> 00:06:25,899
- for our audience well it really was

113
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:31,240
the identification of the receptors

114
00:06:25,899 --> 00:06:34,089
themselves cloning them citing them

115
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:37,810
wherever they were found both in the

116
00:06:34,089 --> 00:06:41,069
brain and peripherally the CB - that

117
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:44,370
cannabinoid - receptor is primarily in

118
00:06:41,069 --> 00:06:49,149
the immune system and more peripheral

119
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:54,149
nervous system and CB one is primarily

120
00:06:49,149 --> 00:06:56,799
in the brain these endogenous

121
00:06:54,149 --> 00:07:00,250
cannabinoid like substances that I've

122
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:03,370
mentioned were elaborated and a good

123
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:08,350
deal of just straight pharmacology done

124
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:12,100
on them so that we had the advantage of

125
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:17,290
oh for example showing the effects in

126
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:20,080
animals on pain and showing the effects

127
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:22,990
on control of motion things of that

128
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:25,329
nature from these basic science advances

129
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:28,600
they were really quite remarkable and

130
00:07:25,329 --> 00:07:31,449
pretty exciting - an internist clinician

131
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:34,290
like myself had no idea that he had

132
00:07:31,449 --> 00:07:34,289
existed
