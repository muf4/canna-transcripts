1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,160
okay i'm dan to the cannabis liberation

2
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:05,599
society we've been in existence about

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,839
four years

4
00:00:05,599 --> 00:00:09,678
we're working on legalization

5
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:11,120
we don't talk about it i mean sure we

6
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:13,679
talk about it but i mean now we're doing

7
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:15,439
more we're actually working on it we're

8
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,440
actually there's two petitions in the

9
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:19,559
state of oregon for the re-legalization

10
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:22,880
of the state i mean for the

11
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:25,679
re-legalization of cannabis

12
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:27,759
but we need help big time there's some

13
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:28,960
things cooking uh you need to talk to

14
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,960
some people in the booze and find out

15
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,280
what's going on but the main thing is we

16
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,960
need help i went to the county fair this

17
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,719
year we worked the last three years

18
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,320
we've been at the county fair we've been

19
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,399
fighting off the the officials are

20
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,480
trying to run us off we've been insulted

21
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:43,679
but here's a pin this is a pin that i

22
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:45,759
picked up somebody gave to me at the

23
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:47,519
county fair this is being handed out

24
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:49,199
it's got a marijuana leaf with the

25
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,120
symbol on you know the slice across it

26
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,280
it says say no to drugs

27
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:55,519
report marijuana there's one 800 number

28
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,039
here and it says oregon state sheriff's

29
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,399
association

30
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,559
so

31
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,679
i had a great idea i only have one but i

32
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:03,038
need to find out where to get these

33
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:05,198
because i thought did you really make

34
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,000
great pins for sending our petitions

35
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:07,200
uh

36
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,118
and then i thought you know we could get

37
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,799
enough of them legally even maybe like

38
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:12,879
auction them off or you know sell them

39
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,799
for a fundraiser to help fight them you

40
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:16,319
know use the weapon against them and

41
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,320
then i got to thinking remember they say

42
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:20,079
there's nothing more minor than the

43
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:22,079
the sword i don't know i see i blew that

44
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:23,599
didn't i the pen is minor in the sword

45
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:24,959
okay

46
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:27,039
if that's true

47
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:29,039
then we have a we have two of the best

48
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,159
weapons and when you're in a war is the

49
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,920
the better weapon you have the better

50
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,320
advantage you have we have two of the

51
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,840
strongest ones first of all we have the

52
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:37,519
pin

53
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,280
and like i said we could use their pin

54
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:41,840
against them and then the other thing is

55
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,399
we have truth now that's a a radical

56
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,000
concept of the truth and i've always

57
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,840
thought that the truth could uh they

58
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,319
don't need to be close they can stand

59
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,640
naked so the thing is well let's get

60
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:55,039
behind legalization i talk to my fellow

61
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,359
activists and they tell me oh well uh we

62
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,520
just don't have time we gotta implement

63
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:01,438
the medical

64
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:03,599
okay let's implement the medical that's

65
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:05,758
fantastic and that's been it's great

66
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:07,519
we've made great strides

67
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,000
but we've got five states that pass the

68
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:12,159
medical let's go for

69
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,800
let's go for legalization you get no

70
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:17,199
amnesty without legalization that's the

71
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,959
bottom line it seems to me it's a

72
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:20,399
no-brainer legalization is what we

73
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,239
should be working on

74
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,920
and i don't mean talking about it like

75
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,560
i'm doing i mean

76
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:28,639
working on it like i and a lot of other

77
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,560
hard-working people are there's no money

78
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:33,039
in legalization so you won't find much

79
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,878
money in it but we're scratching we're

80
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:36,400
back there this is registered to vote in

81
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:38,959
front of our booth we've got a sparkly

82
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,200
windstock and we need help

83
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:43,360
we need help not only money-wise we need

84
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:45,679
help and personnel wise we need help and

00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,519
equipment uh anything you can donate do

86
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,760
you think to get help we need computers

87
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,200
we need uh people that have might have

88
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:53,439
computer permit they can loan out let's

89
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:55,919
get more people online communication is

90
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:57,039
the key if we can get online more people

91
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:59,359
online

92
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:01,199
uh i think that you know that's another

93
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,800
idea of that but anyway

94
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:04,479
