1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:06,080
you also testified before the DEA in

2
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:07,359
1988 I did indeed and now what what came

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,280
from that and who did you speak with

4
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:12,719
when you were there I testified in front

5
00:00:10,279 --> 00:00:16,719
of a a judge Francis young very

6
00:00:12,718 --> 00:00:18,759
intelligent man and the feeling of the

7
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:23,118
people that I was working with normal

8
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:25,920
and uh that that it it was he was going

9
00:00:23,118 --> 00:00:27,640
to brush it off okay we were going to

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,560
finish our testimony and 15 minutes

11
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:33,120
later he was going to say forget it he

12
00:00:29,559 --> 00:00:35,878
didn't do that he um agonized over this

13
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:39,199
for a long time and his DEC he was he

14
00:00:35,878 --> 00:00:42,280
was only to make a recommendation to the

15
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:46,120
head of DEA he couldn't make the

16
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:48,399
decision and he recommended

17
00:00:46,119 --> 00:00:50,439
wholeheartedly and he had heard people

18
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:53,480
all over the United States from all

19
00:00:50,439 --> 00:00:56,959
different kinds of illnesses and said in

20
00:00:53,479 --> 00:00:59,558
effect for God's sakes help these people

21
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:03,878
and what kind of response did he receive

22
00:00:59,558 --> 00:01:06,478
the had of DEA in effects said drop dead

23
00:01:03,878 --> 00:01:10,000
why do you think that is cuz they're

24
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:12,400
stupid okay now I we only have a couple

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,400
of minutes left and I was wondering you

26
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,000
commented that people of an older

27
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,640
generation than what I am have a problem

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,359
at times being able to re re rethink

29
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:25,560
restructure their thinking on this plant

30
00:01:22,359 --> 00:01:28,560
what do you have to say to them okay we

31
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:31,799
were told and and I came from an era

32
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:34,200
that if somebody if my government told

33
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:36,439
me uh go out and stand in the middle of

34
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,000
the traffic I'd probably do it because

35
00:01:36,438 --> 00:01:38,719
they would never tell me anything that

36
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,399
was

37
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:45,239
harmful and it has taken me a long time

38
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:47,920
to realize this isn't this is no longer

39
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:50,519
true maybe it never was but I thought it

40
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:55,200
was and so

41
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:58,560
therefore um it's difficult you you you

42
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,039
just it's like a religion you may go

43
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,439
away from the religion that you were

44
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:06,118
brought up as a child but it's always

45
00:02:02,438 --> 00:02:09,639
there oh go with your gut feeling if you

46
00:02:06,118 --> 00:02:12,878
think you're right go for it thank you

47
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:12,878
very much
