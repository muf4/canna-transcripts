comprehensive system to regulate

22
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:11,670
cannabis marijuana here in the state of

23
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:14,549
Oregon that would allow the sale of

24
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:17,099
marijuana to medical patients through

25
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:21,450
pharmacies at cost it would allow the

26
00:01:17,099 --> 00:01:24,719
sale to adult over 21 of a psychoactive

27
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:26,400
marijuana and state liquor stores allow

28
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:28,469
people to grow it at home for their own

29
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:33,150
personal use and allow our farmers to

30
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:35,489
grow it you know and for products

31
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:38,340
it's the non psychoactive variety to

32
00:01:35,489 --> 00:01:41,099
take part in the world trade as it as it

33
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:43,920
were and tonight we're real fortunate to

34
00:01:41,099 --> 00:01:47,489
have once again a special guest an

35
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,540

00:01:47,489 --> 00:01:50,280
to live here in Portland

37
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:52,439
he's live in Washington DC he's live in

38
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:55,170
Texas but right now he's sitting on a

39
00:01:52,438 --> 00:01:57,269
couch next to me and this is Lanny

40
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:59,849
Sinkin thank you pull up the pleasure to

41
00:01:57,269 --> 00:02:02,399
be here all right and so you're here for

42
00:01:59,849 --> 00:02:03,839
on behalf of a couple cases that I'm

43
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:07,799
involved with so but why don't you tell

44
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,840
us about the the CRH case the campaign

45
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:12,750
restoration case as the nice circuit

46
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:17,009
likes to call it this is a civil rights

47
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:19,439
action brought in Portland on behalf of

48
00:02:17,009 --> 00:02:20,169
three political organizations in one

49
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:22,930
individual

50
00:02:20,169 --> 00:02:26,199
and it stems from the city of Portland

51
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:29,560
using public resources for partisan

52
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:33,039
political purposes the story begins when

53
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:36,310
the campaign to pay for schools by

54
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:39,129
regulating cannabis announced its

55
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:43,599
petition drive to put an initiative on

56
00:02:39,129 --> 00:02:48,039
the ballot in January of 1995 I guess in

57
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:49,329
January first effort at the on the same

58
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:52,239
day that they held their press

59
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:54,219
conference announcing that the official

60
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:57,450
spokesperson for the Portland Police

61
00:02:54,219 --> 00:02:59,949
Department an officer named Jensen

62
00:02:57,449 --> 00:03:03,009
appeared before the television cameras

63
00:02:59,949 --> 00:03:06,609
to question the motivations of those who

64
00:03:03,009 --> 00:03:08,949
were sponsoring this initiative and that

65
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:11,890
act alone constitutes official

66
00:03:08,949 --> 00:03:14,259
opposition to signature gathering which

67
00:03:11,889 --> 00:03:16,509
is against state law in Oregon more

68
00:03:14,259 --> 00:03:18,280
importantly is an unconstitutional use

69
00:03:16,509 --> 00:03:20,318
of public funds for partisan purposes

70
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:22,599
the Fourth Amendment to the United

71
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:24,539
States Constitution guarantees all

72
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:27,608
citizens a republican form of government

73
00:03:24,539 --> 00:03:30,280
what that means is that while people may

74
00:03:27,609 --> 00:03:33,700
delegate their power to a government the

75
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:36,250
government cannot operate partially on

76
00:03:33,699 --> 00:03:38,289
behalf of any group within the society

77
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:40,870
it must be responsible to all the people

78
00:03:38,289 --> 00:03:42,219
where the power continues to reside so

79
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:44,950
for our government to use public

80
00:03:42,219 --> 00:03:47,079
resources in a partisan way to try and

81
00:03:44,949 --> 00:03:49,798
defeat one side of a political issue is

82
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:53,109
both illegal and unconstitutional and

83
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:55,840
once officer Jensen did come out

84
00:03:53,109 --> 00:03:59,500
publicly opposing the initiative Paul

85
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:02,409
Stanford wrote to the mayor mayor Katz

86
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:04,239
at the time and still saying that this

87
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:06,159
was an illegal act and requesting the

88
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,560
mayor to tell the police not to do this

89
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:10,299
kind of thing there was no response to

90
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,390
that letter a copy of that letter went

91
00:04:10,299 --> 00:04:18,069
to the Chief of Police mr. moose mr.

92
00:04:13,389 --> 00:04:20,889
Stanford didn't wrote a then called the

93
00:04:18,069 --> 00:04:23,349
mayor's office to ask why there had been

94
00:04:20,889 --> 00:04:25,689
no response and the mayor's aide said

95
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:28,120
that there would be no response because

96
00:04:25,689 --> 00:04:30,310
the mayor agreed with what the police

97
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:33,399
officer was doing disagreed with the

98
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:33,790
initiative so that gave an official and

99
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:37,000
prim

100
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:40,540
Juran official okay to the eagle illegal

101
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,639
use of public funds to campaign against

102
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:46,030
the gathering of signatures on this

103
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:49,240
initiative and indeed prompted further

104
00:04:46,029 --> 00:04:52,329
police action along the same lines two

105
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:54,850
officers tried to prevent the issuance

106
00:04:52,329 --> 00:04:57,250
of a permit for the annual hip festival

107
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:59,830
Jeff and Susie Crawford our key

108
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:02,529
organizers of that annual event Jeff had

109
00:04:59,829 --> 00:05:04,329
applied for the permit for the event two

110
00:05:02,529 --> 00:05:05,769
police officers went to the parks

111
00:05:04,329 --> 00:05:07,949
department and tried to convince the

112
00:05:05,769 --> 00:05:10,479
parks department not to issue the permit

113
00:05:07,949 --> 00:05:11,740
had the parks department not issued the

114
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:14,080
permit it would have been a clearly

115
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:16,389
unconstitutional act a clear civil

116
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:19,019
rights violation for the hemp event

117
00:05:16,389 --> 00:05:21,610
sponsors a denial of their civil rights

118
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:23,949
here you have two police officers paid

119
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:25,810
in their official position with the

120
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:28,659
sanction of their supervising police

121
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:31,300
officer trying to convince other public

122
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:33,220
employees to act unconstitutionally to

123
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:34,680
suppress an event at which signatures

124
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:37,000
were to be gathered on an initiative

125
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,709
again a violation of state law a

126
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,470
violation of constitutional principles

127
00:05:38,709 --> 00:05:44,109
so those two officers were named as well

128
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:48,790
I remember in that case once Jeff

129
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:50,319
Crawford was saying that complaining to

130
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:52,030
the police officer and said that

131
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:53,920
something like you know this is a

132
00:05:52,029 --> 00:05:56,019
violation of our constitutional rights

133
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:58,660
and one of the officers that's included

134
00:05:56,019 --> 00:06:00,849
in the suit responded that the

135
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:02,680
Constitution doesn't mean anything wrong

136
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:06,100
and so that's the type of mentality

137
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:08,860
we're dealing with here what the police

138
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:10,930
officers did too was once the

139
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:13,060
fortunately the parks department simply

140
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:15,120
would not go along with them and did

141
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:17,350
issue the permit as they should have

142
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,329
once that was done the police then

143
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:21,129
organized their own counter event and

144
00:06:19,329 --> 00:06:22,990
they wanted to put it right next to the

145
00:06:21,129 --> 00:06:25,600
hemp festival in the parks department

146
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:27,639
put it down the street yeah but it was a

147
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:30,280
counter event that included bringing in

148
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:33,310
seized vehicles helicopters Coast Guard

149
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:35,169
boats all kinds of intimidation to

150
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:37,930
strike fear into those that would be

151
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:39,100
attending the hemp festival I trust it

152
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:41,170
was perceived by them more as

153
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:43,120
entertainment than a source of fear but

154
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:45,550
it was designed to instill fear in them

155
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,829
you know we do face fear I'm in our

156
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:48,600
campaign

157
00:06:46,829 --> 00:06:51,180
I can't think of a single other

158
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:54,570
political organization that has to deal

159
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:57,810
with supporters paranoia the way we do

160
00:06:54,569 --> 00:06:59,639
there are people who don't want to call

161
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:01,500
us don't want to assign our petitions

162
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:03,209
because they're afraid that the police

163
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,709
are going to come after them and having

164
00:07:03,209 --> 00:07:09,449
the police come out in the media this

165
00:07:04,709 --> 00:07:11,669
way just reinforces that fear that our

166
00:07:09,449 --> 00:07:13,800
organization has to deal with that no

167
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:15,509
other political group today that I know

168
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:19,110
of has to deal with I mean during the

169
00:07:15,509 --> 00:07:20,849
civil rights actions in the 60s the

170
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:23,129
civil rights organizations had to deal

171
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:24,870
with police repression but today I can't

172
00:07:23,129 --> 00:07:26,250
think of others no that's and it's an

173
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:28,829
important point it's really what the

174
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:31,800
civil rights law was designed to prevent

175
00:07:28,829 --> 00:07:34,349
which was the use of public power to

176
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:36,329
suppress unpopular political movements

177
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:39,379
and the case that we have brought is a

178
00:07:36,329 --> 00:07:43,769
civil case under the Civil Rights Act

179
00:07:39,379 --> 00:07:45,899
after the hemp event was held two other

180
00:07:43,769 --> 00:07:48,240
officers one from the marijuana task

181
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:50,370
force and one from the DARE program were

182
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,980
approached by a reporter doing a story

183
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:54,990
about the initiative and they gave

184
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:56,670
statements opposing the initiative and

185
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:59,040
why they opposed the initiative again

186
00:07:56,670 --> 00:08:01,230
directly contradictory to state law that

187
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:03,870
forbids such activity by public

188
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:05,970
employees for good reason I mean the law

189
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:08,490
is based on the idea that the public

190
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:10,920
government cannot use public resources

191
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:13,350
to fund one side of a political campaign

192
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:15,830
the law does make a distinction between

193
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:17,939
statements of personal opinion and

194
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:20,370
statements that are violations of this

195
00:08:17,939 --> 00:08:22,019
law if a police officer working for the

196
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:24,449
marijuana task force wants to sit around

197
00:08:22,019 --> 00:08:25,799
his kitchen table and tell his friends

198
00:08:24,449 --> 00:08:28,170
that he thinks that the initiative is a

199
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,730
terrible idea that's one thing when he's

200
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:32,038
giving an interview to a member of the

201
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:34,110
press in his official position with his

202
00:08:32,038 --> 00:08:36,449
official identification on official time

203
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:38,370
paid for by all the taxpayers in uniform

204
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:40,259
in uniform that's a whole other thing

205
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:41,940
and that's what we have here with the

206
00:08:40,259 --> 00:08:47,189
five officers that have been named in

207
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:50,520
the suit a very how should I put it

208
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:53,310
biased judge that we faced here in

209
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:55,889
Portland threw the case out saying that

210
00:08:53,309 --> 00:08:58,439
there were no federal claims identified

211
00:08:55,889 --> 00:08:59,699
in this case that we've taken up on

212
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:02,130
appeal

213
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:04,290
the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals by

214
00:09:02,129 --> 00:09:07,649
the time this show is aired I think that

215
00:09:04,289 --> 00:09:10,769
appeal will have been heard correct and

216
00:09:07,649 --> 00:09:13,980
we will be waiting for a decision part

217
00:09:10,769 --> 00:09:16,590
of the the rule under the Civil Rights

218
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:18,180
Act is for a municipality to be liable

219
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:22,129
and we have named the city of Portland

220
00:09:18,179 --> 00:09:26,309
as the the chief defendant in this case

221
00:09:22,129 --> 00:09:29,189
you must have a policy being implemented

222
00:09:26,309 --> 00:09:31,139
and one of the one of the indicators

223
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:33,930
that there is a policy is if official

224
00:09:31,139 --> 00:09:35,429
policy makers ratify the actions that

225
00:09:33,929 --> 00:09:38,309
were violations of civil rights

226
00:09:35,429 --> 00:09:40,739
well when mayor Katz said that she was

227
00:09:38,309 --> 00:09:43,049
not going to take any action regarding

228
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:45,570
officer Jensen's illegal statements to

229
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:47,339
the press and in fact supported those

230
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:49,530
statements because she opposed the

231
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:51,750
initiative then mayor Katz made the city

232
00:09:49,529 --> 00:09:54,720
of Portland liable for any damages that

233
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:56,820
a jury would care to reward to the three

234
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,040
organizations or mr. Crawford who's also

235
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:01,020
a plaintiff in this instance and I

236
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:04,110
should say that another piece of the

237
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:05,909
puzzle is that we filed complaints or

238
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:10,320
actually Paul Stanford filed complaints

239
00:10:05,909 --> 00:10:12,719
with the state the state has to enforce

240
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,430
the election laws so those complaints

241
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:18,269
were filed with the state elections

242
00:10:14,429 --> 00:10:20,370
Division asking that they penalized the

243
00:10:18,269 --> 00:10:24,600
police officers who were violating state

244
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:27,690
law and we did a dance with that state

245
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:30,269
group that went on for more than three

246
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:32,180
years if I'm correct or somewhere in the

247
00:10:30,269 --> 00:10:34,799
neighborhood of two and a half years

248
00:10:32,179 --> 00:10:36,719
before we could ever get any kind of

249
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:38,519
real response from the state government

250
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,879
that's supposed to be enforcing the

251
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:44,699
state law but the state law is quite

252
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:47,759
clear that state employees particularly

253
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:51,110
municipal employees are not to engage in

254
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:53,519
political activity funded by the

255
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:55,320
municipality and that that's a law

256
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:58,379
that's posted where they can all see it

257
00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:00,210
they are all aware of it it was very

258
00:10:58,379 --> 00:11:02,129
interesting in the newspaper interviews

259
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:04,080
where the two officers came out opposed

260
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:07,230
to the initiative other state employees

261
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:09,450
said we are not allowed by law to

262
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:10,980
comment directly on an initiative they

263
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:12,370
did comment on what affects the

264
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:13,629
initiative might have on

265
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:15,399
the administration of their particular

266
00:11:13,629 --> 00:11:18,278
agency things like that perfectly

267
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:20,409
legitimate but the police were right up

268
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:21,720
front one officer said I'm opposed to

269
00:11:20,409 --> 00:11:24,819
the initiative that was his lead

270
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:26,139
statement so we had a whole series of

271
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:27,220
violations we went to the state

272
00:11:26,139 --> 00:11:28,360
government and asked them to do

273
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:29,440
something about it they wouldn't do

274
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,089
anything about it we went to the

275
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,290
municipal government asked him to do

276
00:11:31,089 --> 00:11:34,390
something about it they wouldn't do

277
00:11:32,289 --> 00:11:36,639
anything about it so we eventually had

278
00:11:34,389 --> 00:11:39,399
to go to the federal courts and we will

279
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:41,230
now wait and see what the federal court

280
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:42,519
has to say about whether the relief

281
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:44,350
that's being sought which is an

282
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:45,730
injunction to prevent them from doing

283
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:48,339
this kind of thing while the new

284
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:50,409
campaign is going on will indeed be

285
00:11:48,339 --> 00:11:52,300
entered if it is it'll be additional

286
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:54,549
protection for people who are trying to

287
00:11:52,299 --> 00:11:55,959
gather the signatures an acknowledgement

288
00:11:54,549 --> 00:11:57,909
that people who are trying to gather the

289
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:59,769
signatures are entitled to protection

290
00:11:57,909 --> 00:12:02,829
the Civil Rights Act it would be very

291
00:11:59,769 --> 00:12:05,519
helpful in that sense in the past year

292
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:09,330
I've had the police the Portland Police

293
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:13,088
Marijuana Task Force agents opposes in

294
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:14,740
in the media several times again so it's

295
00:12:13,089 --> 00:12:17,140
continuing clear they're not getting the

296
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:19,690
message right and we hope this lawsuit

297
00:12:17,139 --> 00:12:22,120
will send that message and that it's

298
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:23,560
also clear that when people are afraid

299
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:26,679
to participate in the political process

300
00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:28,509
we have a real problem and I hope that

301
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:31,088
people who want to support the

302
00:12:28,509 --> 00:12:33,458
initiative will not be afraid and the

303
00:12:31,089 --> 00:12:35,980
way to get past the fear is to simply

304
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:37,329
get past the fear if enough people sign

305
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:39,370
the initiative if enough people

306
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:41,440
circulate the initiative if enough

307
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:43,959
people contribute money then they can't

308
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:46,180
go out and go after everybody and the

309
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:48,399
more we get people of stature in the

310
00:12:46,179 --> 00:12:51,009
community I hope that anybody that's

311
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,990
holding a political office or is an

312
00:12:51,009 --> 00:12:55,539
acknowledged leader in the community who

313
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:57,190
cares about democracy will sign these

314
00:12:55,539 --> 00:12:58,838
petitions to put this initiative on the

315
00:12:57,190 --> 00:13:01,180
ballot to give people a chance to vote

316
00:12:58,839 --> 00:13:03,190
yes or no it's not saying you favor the

317
00:13:01,179 --> 00:13:04,778
change in the law it's really saying you

318
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:06,970
favor people being given the right to

319
00:13:04,778 --> 00:13:08,980
vote on this I hope the political

320
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:10,810
leaders and community leaders and people

321
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:13,509
who are acknowledged in the community is

322
00:13:10,809 --> 00:13:15,639
having stature even by the police will

323
00:13:13,509 --> 00:13:17,200
sign this will contribute to it to give

324
00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:19,629
their the protection of their

325
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,180
participation to those that are on the

326
00:13:19,629 --> 00:13:22,820
cutting

327
00:13:20,179 --> 00:13:24,739
of political activity and suffering from

328
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:27,890
official repression for engaging in such

329
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:30,860
activity yeah I think it's a good time

330
00:13:27,889 --> 00:13:33,409
here to bring up our phone number again

331
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:35,690

332

very educational footage on that website

00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:05,509
as well yeah you know I'd like to get

364
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:06,950
back to a point to me you think that

365
00:15:05,509 --> 00:15:09,528
most people the public if you go up and

366
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:12,680
talk to them they say you know can a

367
00:15:09,528 --> 00:15:15,679
public official while on the job being

368
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:17,269
identifies public official comment you

369
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:19,309
know on a political issue everybody said

370
00:15:17,269 --> 00:15:21,169
well no of course not but the the

371
00:15:19,309 --> 00:15:22,609
distinction the law makes is between

372
00:15:21,169 --> 00:15:25,458
elected officials who have an obligation

373
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:28,070
to comment and non elected officials who

374
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:31,339
are on the public payroll as civil

375
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:34,160
servants or otherwise public employees

376
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:36,170
and I would think it would be clear that

377
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:39,409
we don't want the the way this law

378
00:15:36,169 --> 00:15:41,569
originally came up the the whole context

379
00:15:39,409 --> 00:15:45,379
for the ruling is an Oregon Supreme

380
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:48,650
Court case in which the issue was

381
00:15:45,379 --> 00:15:51,889
fluoridation and a municipal government

382
00:15:48,649 --> 00:15:55,340
had actually appropriated money to run a

383
00:15:51,889 --> 00:15:58,069
campaign in favor of fluoridation that

384
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:58,820
was challenged by people who opposed the

385
00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:01,160
fluoridation

386
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:03,530
and the Oregon Supreme Court was quite

387
00:16:01,159 --> 00:16:05,449
clear that the government couldn't take

388
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:08,329
public funds and spend them on one side

389
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:10,190
of an issue couldn't hire people to go

390
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:12,500
out and campaign as they did in that

391
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:14,540
instance on one side of an issue and

392
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:17,629
print literature and all of those things

393
00:16:14,539 --> 00:16:21,199
and while the activity in this case

394
00:16:17,629 --> 00:16:23,299
hasn't reached that level the type of

395
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,950
activity is exactly the same now when

396
00:16:23,299 --> 00:16:26,929
Officer Jenson is sitting in front of

397
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:28,700
the television camera questioning the

398
00:16:26,929 --> 00:16:31,250
motives and otherwise incurred

399
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:34,280
discouraging people from signing this

400
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:36,379
initiative his time is being paid for by

401
00:16:34,279 --> 00:16:38,120
the public he's wearing his uniform he's

402
00:16:36,379 --> 00:16:39,860
speaking in his official position as

403
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:42,980
spokesperson for the police department

404
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:44,570
all of these are the checkoff points for

405
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:47,029
whether he's speaking in his personal

406
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:48,590
position and has a free speech right to

407
00:16:47,029 --> 00:16:50,149
say what he's saying or whether he's

408
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:52,129
speaking as a public official which is

409
00:16:50,149 --> 00:16:53,779
forbidden under law and violates the

410
00:16:52,129 --> 00:16:56,090
Fourth Amendment the fourth article of

411
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:58,399
the Constitution yeah I mean it's really

412
00:16:56,090 --> 00:17:00,920
clear - is it I mean at that time you

413
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:02,870
know he was the face and voice of a

414
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:04,549
Portland Police Department that's the

415
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:06,049
one that they'd show on television every

416
00:17:04,549 --> 00:17:08,629
night whenever there was you know a

417
00:17:06,049 --> 00:17:11,359
gruesome murder or you know or whatever

418
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:13,190
you want talk about he was to face and a

419
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:15,799
voice that people saw and so he was the

420
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:18,920
official voice so it's this real obvious

421
00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:20,779
that you know that you know when me come

422
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:23,360
up and ask him for comments he should

423
00:17:20,779 --> 00:17:25,069
have said sorry no you know come to me

424
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:26,240
after I was over a beer whatever and I

425
00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:28,879
can tell you what I personally think

426
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:33,349
then there's another element here that

427
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:36,490
people should be aware of given the laws

428
00:17:33,349 --> 00:17:38,480
on confiscation of property

429
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:41,690
taking people's property if they're

430
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:43,579
arrested on a drug offense number of

431
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:44,990
those laws target the proceeds of those

432
00:17:43,579 --> 00:17:47,960
confiscations to go to the police

433
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:50,569
department so you have police who

434
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:54,319
essentially collect the bounty when they

435
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:57,619
bust someone on drugs and that gives

436
00:17:54,319 --> 00:18:00,649
them a bias automatically in favor of a

437
00:17:57,619 --> 00:18:02,689
program that pays their salaries as

438
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:04,880
opposed to changing or laws that would

439
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:07,670
deny them those access to those

440
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:10,430
resources so in the police you even have

441
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:12,920
a particularly biased group to be coming

442
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:14,539
out and campaigning not that any group

443
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,980
on the public payroll should be coming

444
00:18:14,539 --> 00:18:17,869
out and campaigning but the police have

445
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:21,019
every reason in the world to violate the

446
00:18:17,869 --> 00:18:23,149
law and engage in such a campaign which

447
00:18:21,019 --> 00:18:24,740
made it even more important that the

448
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:27,170
political leadership coming from mayor

449
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:29,329
Katz or the administrative leadership

450
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:31,570
coming from Chief Moose say to those

451
00:18:29,329 --> 00:18:33,980
officers this is not acceptable behavior

452
00:18:31,569 --> 00:18:35,779
we can understand you may feel strongly

453
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:37,460
about it but you're not allowed to use

454
00:18:35,779 --> 00:18:39,859
your official position or official time

455
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:41,690
to go out and campaign politically

456
00:18:39,859 --> 00:18:44,659
against this initiative they had a

457
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:46,340
almost a doubly important obligation

458
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:49,190
because this group would be so tempted

459
00:18:46,339 --> 00:18:52,639
to go out and protect their honey pot

460
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:56,150
you know yeah they have a huge economic

461
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:58,160
incentive to continue the marijuana laws

462
00:18:56,150 --> 00:19:00,680
and they never bring that up you know

463
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:02,450
recently they tried to recrimination

464
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:04,850
Oregon and I was down there lobbying

465
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:07,160
against it I can tell you that the only

466
00:19:04,849 --> 00:19:09,559
people that were lobbying in favor of it

467
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:11,840
were the Association of Chiefs of Police

468
00:19:09,559 --> 00:19:14,720
and the lobbyists for the State Police

469
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:16,879
there were no other lobbyists down there

470
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:19,039
working on this issue except police

471
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,660
officer lobbyists and they're the ones

472
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:22,159
that pushed it through and fortunately

473
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:24,320
we were able to stop that

474
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:26,330
now we're circulating we stopped it

475
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:28,700
through the referendum process by

476
00:19:26,329 --> 00:19:31,069
gathering 90,000 signatures now we're

477
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:33,740
circulating the Oregon cannabis Tax Act

478
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:36,799
to just completely end the war on

479
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:39,410
marijuana users and to regulate and tax

480
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:42,769
the sale of marijuana to adults allow

481
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:45,290

bit of time to go into that but well I

500
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:36,799
can touch on that briefly the Christic

501
00:20:34,849 --> 00:20:38,480
Institute filed a racketeering case

502
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:42,169
against many of the key figures in the

503
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:44,150
iran-contra scandal we engaged in all

504
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:46,550
kinds of efforts to gather evidence and

505
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:48,019
put it before the court four days before

506
00:20:46,549 --> 00:20:50,779
we were supposed to go to trial the

507
00:20:48,019 --> 00:20:53,180
judge threw the case out then he ruled

508
00:20:50,779 --> 00:20:56,119
that the entire case was frivolous find

509
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:57,950
us 1.2 million dollars and we went up on

510
00:20:56,119 --> 00:20:59,809
appeal to the 11th circuit while we were

511
00:20:57,950 --> 00:21:01,370
on appeal one judge was killed by a bomb

512
00:20:59,809 --> 00:21:03,559
there was an attempted assassination of

513
00:21:01,369 --> 00:21:05,209
a second judge we know from discussions

514
00:21:03,559 --> 00:21:08,750
with court personnel that those acts

515
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:11,210
were attributed to our case or at least

516
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:12,740
linked in their minds to our case so the

517
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:14,690
appellate court at the 11th circuit

518
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:16,400
threw the appeal out ruled the entire

519
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:18,529
appeal frivolous even though we had

520
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,210
amicus briefs from major national

521
00:21:18,529 --> 00:21:21,559
organizations religious organizations

522
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:23,090
legal organizations political

523
00:21:21,559 --> 00:21:24,440
organizations and there was another

524
00:21:23,089 --> 00:21:26,149
three or four hundred thousand dollars

525
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:27,680
in penalties that's assessed against us

526
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:30,500
they basically put the Christic

527
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:33,110
Institute out of business that case was

528
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:35,299
about democracy this case is about

529
00:21:33,109 --> 00:21:37,250
democracy there are things that can be

530
00:21:35,299 --> 00:21:38,809
so controversial that the democratic

531
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:41,319
system has a hard time dealing with them

532
00:21:38,809 --> 00:21:43,909
in the case of the Christic Institute

533
00:21:41,319 --> 00:21:45,619
racketeering lawsuit we were talking

534
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:47,630
about 30 years of illegal covert

535
00:21:45,619 --> 00:21:49,609
operations and the judicial system

536
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:51,230
simply could not deal with the evidence

537
00:21:49,609 --> 00:21:53,089
that we wanted to present could not

538
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:54,920
allow the truth to come out that would

539
00:21:53,089 --> 00:21:58,099
expose these government operations and

540
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:59,539
and damage the faith of the people that

541
00:21:58,099 --> 00:22:02,869
their government was operating in their

542
00:21:59,539 --> 00:22:03,259
interest so you had official repression

543
00:22:02,869 --> 00:22:05,719
of that

544
00:22:03,259 --> 00:22:07,400
a suit similar to what we've seen in the

545
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:09,860
official repression directed against the

546
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:12,650
hip movement but a democracy is always a

547
00:22:09,859 --> 00:22:14,119
challenge because democracy means every

548
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:16,400
one of us takes responsibility for

549
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:19,159
making it work that means every one of

550
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:21,980
us is offended if someone is silenced by

551
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:24,350
the government or by a policeman or by

552
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:26,450
the mayor or by the city attorney every

553
00:22:24,349 --> 00:22:28,669
one of us should be offended when that

554
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:30,680
happens because if everyone doesn't have

555
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:33,440
freedom of speech then no one really has

556
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:36,140
freedom of speech and only through the

557
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:37,940
interplay of ideas and everyone's views

558
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:39,620
getting on the table do we ever reach

559
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:42,470
the best understanding as to what we

560
00:22:39,619 --> 00:22:45,289
should be doing I'm sure right now there

561
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:46,700
are major forces being marshal to

562
00:22:45,289 --> 00:22:49,009
suppress information about global

563
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:50,509
warming and suppress information about

564
00:22:49,009 --> 00:22:52,460
many of the other environmental things

565
00:22:50,509 --> 00:22:54,470
the asthma epidemic among children

566
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:56,150
that's happening on this planet there

567
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:57,920
will but constantly be efforts to

568
00:22:56,150 --> 00:23:00,019
prevent the information from coming out

569
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:02,330
to the public that might change public

570
00:23:00,019 --> 00:23:04,220
policy to the detriment of groups that

571
00:23:02,329 --> 00:23:05,559
are engaged in things they shouldn't be

572
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:07,549
doing so you

573
00:23:05,559 --> 00:23:10,849
democracy does require constant

574
00:23:07,549 --> 00:23:13,639
vigilance and I think Paul and I as

575
00:23:10,849 --> 00:23:15,829
attorneys are happy to take these kinds

576
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:19,220
of cases to the federal judiciary but

577
00:23:15,829 --> 00:23:21,259
we're also not pollyannish about it in

578
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:24,350
terms of what the federal judiciary can

579
00:23:21,259 --> 00:23:27,470
or will do they're there to protect the

580
00:23:24,349 --> 00:23:29,689
Constitution right to the people but by

581
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:31,579
now it must be close to 90% of the

582
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:33,519
judges in the federal judiciary have

583
00:23:31,579 --> 00:23:37,279
been appointed by Richard Nixon or

584
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:39,410
Ronald Reagan or George Bush with

585
00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:42,200
President Clinton's appointments also

586
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:43,160
being fairly right-wing generally or at

587
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:46,580
least middle-of-the-road

588
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:48,590
the age of the liberal justice you know

589
00:23:46,579 --> 00:23:49,939
justice Douglas if he came back and

590
00:23:48,589 --> 00:23:52,669
looked at the justices who were on the

591
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:55,640
courts now would be appalled at the kind

592
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:58,820
of activist reactionary judges we have

593
00:23:55,640 --> 00:24:00,550
who are undoing many years of civil

594
00:23:58,819 --> 00:24:03,649
rights and other protections that were

595
00:24:00,549 --> 00:24:05,419
established by the joushi area you're

596
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:07,430
fortunate here in Portland in us in

597
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:09,650
Hawaii we're in the ninth circuit it is

598
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:11,660
sort of the last bastion of democracy in

599
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:13,370
the federal judiciary so we're

600
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:15,269
optimistic that these cases will be

601
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:17,309
successful that we're bringing on behalf

602
00:24:15,269 --> 00:24:18,869
hip movement in Portland but we're not

603
00:24:17,309 --> 00:24:21,210
sanguine about what's happening to the

604
00:24:18,869 --> 00:24:22,829
federal judiciary in general and about

605
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:24,809
the loss of freedoms that are taking

606
00:24:22,829 --> 00:24:27,000
place in the United States we in Hawaii

607
00:24:24,809 --> 00:24:29,429
are committed to the sovereignty

608
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,470
movement that in one form or another we

609
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:33,360
trust the islands of Hawaii will leave

610
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:36,509
the United States over the next five or

611
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:38,399
ten years most people don't realize that

612
00:24:36,509 --> 00:24:41,490
Hawaii was an independent nation up

613
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:43,200
until the late 1800s when a conspiracy

614
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:44,819
by United States government officials

615
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,250
and plantation owners overthrew the

616
00:24:44,819 --> 00:24:49,259
monarchy and then made Hawaii a state

617
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:50,940
within the United States many of us in

618
00:24:49,259 --> 00:24:52,379
Hawaii support the idea that Hawaii

619
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:54,240
should become independent once again

620
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:55,860
then we won't have to worry about the

621
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,019
federal judiciary in the United States

622
00:24:55,859 --> 00:25:00,629

623
00:24:58,019 --> 00:25:02,460
