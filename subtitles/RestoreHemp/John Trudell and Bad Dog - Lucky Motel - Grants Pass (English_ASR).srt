pulse a

28
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:30,840
pulse in the charging

she's a good girl coming to understand

34
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:53,959
that sometimes this is what good girls

35
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:57,519
do what good girls do in the breath of

36
00:03:53,959 --> 00:04:00,438
ss and the magic of

37
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:05,200
moan they held them to

38
00:04:00,438 --> 00:04:07,280
together so as not to feel so

39
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:09,679
alone so

40
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:13,878
alone so

41
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:15,879
alone during times of shadow in the

42
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:19,680
background of

43
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:22,199
first the sun waits for the

44
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:26,759
moon to torch the

45
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:30,439
night torch the night in the breath of

46
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:34,879
ss in the magic of moon

47
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:35,918
they held them together so as not feel

48
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:38,399
so

49
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:42,399
alone so

50
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:42,399
alone so

51
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,800
oh
