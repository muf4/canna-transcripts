00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:06,799
hi my name is brave michaela and i

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,798
kicked cancer's butt

3
00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:15,599
with the help of cannabis oil

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,359
i have finished treatments six months

5
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:21,118
ago thank you all for the love and

6
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,118
support peace love here

7
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:34,000
hi thank you so much for being here

8
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:35,759
today my name is erin purchase and i am

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,799
michaela's mom

10
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:41,039
i am also a cannabis activist

11
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:42,718
i've been an activist long before she

12
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:44,640
got cancer that's how i knew to give her

13
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,239
cannabis oil 10 days after she was

14
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,480
diagnosed

15
00:00:46,238 --> 00:00:50,479
i think it's important that all patients

16
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:53,198
get this oil right when they are

17
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:55,119
diagnosed because we never even lost she

18
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:56,799
never even lost a single pound going

19
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:59,280
through chemotherapy and never had to

20
00:00:56,799 --> 00:01:01,519
take a tylenol and had a smile on her

21
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,800
face every day i think it's important

22
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,799
that every

23
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:06,478
child and adult have that right and in

24
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,118
order to do that we have to get our

25
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:11,280
doctors on board and in order to do that

26
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:13,840
we need to change the law at a federal

27
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,879
level congratulations oregon for

28
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,640
legalizing at a state level that's great

29
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:21,039
if we can get more states to do that

30
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,359
maybe we can overturn federal law it is

31
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,360
very very very important to my family

32
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:27,200
that we overturn this federal law and

33
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:30,159
researches began

34
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:32,240
michaela has a very rare form of acute

35
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:35,520
lymphoblastic leukemia

36
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:38,560
it has a low survival rate

37
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:41,840
75 percent i didn't have to worry about

38
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,759
that because i had cannabis oil

39
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,359
most most families don't have that and

40
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,200
they have a lot of anxiety as they're

41
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:48,478
going through treatments not only do

42
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,719
they have a lot of anxiety they're

43
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:53,200
dealing with a child who's suffering

44
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:54,798
with a feeding tube in their nose and

45
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,719
they have to stay in the hospital

46
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,200
sometimes over a year

47
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:01,118
we had 14 days in a hospital and the

48
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,719
only reason my daughter ever had to stay

49
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:05,519
in the hospital was because they gave

50
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:08,639
her forced me to give her drugs that put

51
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:10,560
her there she had two allergic reactions

52
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:14,000
one of them almost killed her because of

53
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,840
their medicine that she did not need

54
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,680
in order to prove that she did not need

55
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,719
it we have to change the federal law

56
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,439
also

57
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:26,479
at a st at a county level on a local

58
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:28,800
level you are all very important because

59
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:30,560
oregon has legalized cannabis

60
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,560
but they have also imposed a lot of

61
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,680
regulations that affect patients like

62
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,039
michaela

63
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:40,000
they have limited our medical marijuana

64
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:42,000
grows now inside city limits to 12

65
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,800
plants that's two patients we went from

66
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,759
being able to grow from four patients to

67
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,439
two

68
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:51,840
they have not passed that bill yet but

69
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:51,840
they're very close to passing it

70
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:57,439
come to salem we're there mondays and

71
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,280

00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:04,959
things like this

75
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:07,039

82
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:21,439
