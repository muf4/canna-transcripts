4
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:20,910
today I've been to each of these over

5
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:23,310
the last 17 years it's the first time

6
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:26,250
we've had two mayoral candidates here

7
00:00:23,309 --> 00:00:28,169

8
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:30,480
than our friend Lou Fredrick who's going

9
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:32,939
to be in Senate next year its first time

10
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:36,239
we've had somebody from the legislature

11
00:00:32,939 --> 00:00:39,689
this year uh and you know I'm always

12
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:42,988
reminded at times like this about how

13
00:00:39,689 --> 00:00:49,259
lucky we are to be here having freed who

14
00:00:42,988 --> 00:00:51,890
heed the and and especially having for

15
00:00:49,259 --> 00:00:54,839
me live long enough to see it happen and

16
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:57,870
at times like this I remember the folks

17
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:00,570
who didn't and I hope you do too you

18
00:00:57,869 --> 00:01:03,358
know I've been working some with is

19
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:05,400
Michael here at echo Michael Becker

20
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,350
right here could you give it up for him

21
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:12,210
please this whole thing would not happen

22
00:01:07,349 --> 00:01:13,798
but for his energy and we were back and

23
00:01:12,209 --> 00:01:15,750
forth a little bit yesterday because I

24
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:17,430
was in touch with Congressman blooming

25
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:19,829
hours office he's not able to be here

26
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:23,490
today but he's you know he's very

27
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:25,829
supportive of what we're doing and I co

28
00:01:23,489 --> 00:01:28,649
had back and forth with the city to this

29
00:01:25,829 --> 00:01:30,750
week about you know where we were going

30
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:33,030
to be able to march and why are we still

31
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:34,109
marching and I thought I'd spend just a

32
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:36,390
couple of minutes talking with you about

33
00:01:34,109 --> 00:01:40,618
why we're still marching anybody

34
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:42,659
remember danbo Daniel Ernst Daniel

35
00:01:40,618 --> 00:01:44,549
instant serving 15 years in federal

36
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:47,640
prison I got a letter from him this week

37
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:48,990
and and that's why we march we march

38
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:55,560
because there are people in federal

39
00:01:48,989 --> 00:01:59,009
prison is cannabis legal everywhere no

40
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:01,618
we march because marijuana is still on

41
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:04,379
the Controlled Substances list when it

42
00:02:01,618 --> 00:02:07,590
needs to be d scheduled we march because

43
00:02:04,379 --> 00:02:09,240
people call marijuana and entry drug

44
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:12,659
when it's actually a neck

45
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:16,560
sit drug an excerpt from addiction we

46
00:02:12,659 --> 00:02:20,069
march because the OHA treats marijuana

47
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:22,979
like it was poison and we know it's a

48
00:02:20,069 --> 00:02:25,189
wellness drug we know that in our

49
00:02:22,979 --> 00:02:28,139
lifetime will be able to go down a

50
00:02:25,189 --> 00:02:30,689
Walgreens and get us some Wall feko or

51
00:02:28,139 --> 00:02:33,209
some wall RS oh it's going to happen

52
00:02:30,689 --> 00:02:35,520
that's that's what's coming next thanks

53
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:37,890
so much for coming out today it's

54
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:40,439
important it's important that we make a

55
00:02:37,889 --> 00:02:43,799
show of consumers I appreciate what Ted

56
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:45,629
had to say about the industry and I

57
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:50,730
appreciate whatcha bias had to say about

58
00:02:45,629 --> 00:02:54,479
the industry but I'm a consumer and I

59
00:02:50,729 --> 00:02:58,799
work towards reforming cannabis laws for

60
00:02:54,479 --> 00:03:00,060
consumers and and and and if you're

61
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,540
talking particularly about income

62
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:05,840
inequality and racism Ted the fees if

63
00:03:03,539 --> 00:03:08,549
for the city of Portland licensing are a

64
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,500
barrier to people of color getting

65
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:12,960
involved in the system to people I mean

66
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,939
I didn't do this for 20 years so the

67
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:17,520
white man could get rich and black kids

68
00:03:14,939 --> 00:03:19,379
would be in prison we're trying to end

69
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:21,870
that one person who's here is working in

70
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:24,900
that is Madeline Martinez who's speaking

71
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:27,030
next Sunday evening in denver at a

72
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:30,180
cannabis diversity summit that our

73
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:32,819
sister charlo green [ __ ] it I quit from

74
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:36,000
Anchorage is putting on if you can find

75
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:41,189
your way to Denver next Sunday that

76
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:46,080

79
00:03:48,509 --> 00:03:52,379
on madeleine's behalf says we freed the

80
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:54,449
weed except you can't use it indoor

81
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:57,870
outdoor what we need and what we hope

82
00:03:54,449 --> 00:04:00,419
the next mayor does Ted is allow us to

83
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:03,240
consume here at this event and to allow

84
00:04:00,419 --> 00:04:06,809
us to consume at ham stock by not

85
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:10,320
enforcing the violation during those two

86
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:13,490
days out of the 365 days in the air
