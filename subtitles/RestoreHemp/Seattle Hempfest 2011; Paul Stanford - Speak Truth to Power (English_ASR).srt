00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:12,679
here a big thank you because you know we

29
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:16,478
got to come out of the closet and demand

30
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:18,560
our freedom we have been put down too

31
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:20,879
long you know marijuana prohibition

32
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,280
isn't about marijuana it's not about

33
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:25,599
drugs that's a smoke screen that's the

34
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:30,040
the story what marijuana prohibition is

35
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:32,399
really about is power and petrochemicals

36
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:36,040
and the continued centralization of

37
00:01:32,399 --> 00:01:38,759
Economic and political control so our

38
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:42,040
job is to speak truth to power and

39
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:44,599
that's what we are here to do I also

40
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:48,040
want to thank all of those patients out

41
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:50,478
there because it's only because of you

42
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:53,159
patients coming to our clinics and

43
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:55,519
supporting us that we have the

44
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:57,200
wherewithal to support this and to

45
00:01:55,519 --> 00:02:02,158
support the

46
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:05,600
Cause right you know May marijuana to me

47
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:08,920
is the Creator's greatest gift to

48
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:12,519
humanity I believe that marijuana is the

49
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:15,598
plant that produces more fuel more fiber

50
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:17,879
more food and more medicine than any

51
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:21,439
other plant on this

52
00:02:17,878 --> 00:02:24,959
planet if you go back all archaeologists

53
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:27,919
agree that marijuana hemp was the first

54
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:30,159
crop purposely sown by humans it was

55
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:33,958
definitely among the first crop and

56
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:36,560
there's some evidence in Central Asia

57
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:39,598
that cannabis cultivation went back

58
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:42,959
40,000 years into the past could well

59
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:46,000
have been the main reason that our

60
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:49,280
ancestors came out of uh the hunter

61
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,318
gather way of life and started to uh

62
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:55,360
grow crops so they could have their

63
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:59,839
stash and we still need our stash today

64
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:02,319
you know about 75 years ago the the IND

65
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,680
industries that were affected the

66
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:07,399
petrochemical wood-based paper the

67
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,200
cotton baronss of the South they

68
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:11,799
realized that HP was going to displace

69
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:14,878
their

70
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:17,280
economic sustenance so they came up with

71
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:20,039
the lies that they presented to us as

72
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:23,080
Reaper Badness saying that marijuana

73
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:25,679
causes us to go crazy and kill our

74
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:30,120
family and friends that was the LIE they

75
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:32,040
sold to us we all know that's not true

76
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,280
20 years a Hempfest and there hasn't

77
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:35,560
been any

78
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:39,640
violence

79
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:41,400
so there's an initiative down here in

80
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:45,759
Washington state there's a couple of

81
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:48,760
them support all of them support it get

82
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:52,399
out there and get some signatures and if

83
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:55,239
you can't get signatures give them money

84
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,799
because every dollar you give them is a

85
00:03:55,239 --> 00:04:01,039
signature that you didn't go out and get

86
00:03:57,799 --> 00:04:04,400
every hour you volunteer to help them is

87
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:09,399
$10 they don't have to spend it comes

88
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:11,319
right down to you and me so I want to

89
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:13,280
once again thank all you folks for

90
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:19,719
coming out here I'm proud that we can

91
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:19,720
help and uh help us restore help
