1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:05,700
Chris Carter and author of Lifetime

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:10,138
Wi-Fi hip Lifeline to the future I may

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:13,019
not Chris back in the late 1980s when

4
00:00:10,138 --> 00:00:15,298
the hip industry was a distant dream

5
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:18,060
Chris understood that somebody needed to

6
00:00:15,298 --> 00:00:20,339
put together a Trade Organization before

7
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:23,519
there were hipsters we had the business

8
00:00:20,339 --> 00:00:25,500
Alliance for Commerce in him that's how

9
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:27,899
forward-thinking Chris Conrad is he

10
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:31,920
decided that Jack's little pamphlet

11
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:33,960
needed to get big and go mainstream and

12
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,780
became the editor of the emperor wears

13
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:40,920
no clothes original Edition

14
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:43,020
and uh has continued on in his current

15
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:46,379
voices the West Coast Leaf everybody

20
00:00:54,659 --> 00:00:58,019
you a lot Don I appreciate that yeah Don

00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,719
here today I really appreciate you guys

23
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,359
being out here

24
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,460
um like like that uh like Tom was saying

25
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,200
though it's but started me on this whole

26
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:09,179
thing I've always worked with news media

27
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,579
and with Progressive politics and I was

28
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:13,380
told by a group of uh uh Progressive

29
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:15,118
activists that you could never change

30
00:01:13,379 --> 00:01:16,618
the marijuana laws that we'd be stuck

31
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:18,359
with them as they were

32
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:19,859
um and I disagree with that I think that

33
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:21,540
uh knowledge of power and power makes

34
00:01:19,859 --> 00:01:22,859
change and so if I could create enough

35
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,000
knowledge that would give people the

36
00:01:22,859 --> 00:01:25,739
power to make the change that was

37
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,900
necessary so I started off by doing

38
00:01:25,739 --> 00:01:30,539
brochures and things like that

39
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:32,100
um and as Don mentioned I quickly

40
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,780
recognized that I wanted to have a book

41
00:01:32,099 --> 00:01:35,578
out there and so I came across like a

42
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:38,759
newspaper thing called the emperor wears

43
00:01:35,578 --> 00:01:40,739
no clothes and uh took me six months to

44
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:42,239
get hold of Jack Herer and convince him

45
00:01:40,739 --> 00:01:44,219
that it was time to put into a really

46
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:46,798
quick form and go forward so we we

47
00:01:44,219 --> 00:01:48,179
revised the book in 1990 uh and I

48
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,680
started writing my own things and so

49
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,939
forth but I was on the periphery of the

50
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,560
media for quite a bit and one of the

51
00:01:50,938 --> 00:01:54,658
things that I was noticing was I could

52
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,460
influence the media to certain extent

53
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:59,520
from where I was but it was not

54
00:01:56,459 --> 00:02:01,919
particularly satisfying I remember for

55
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:03,780
example when I got I met I got hold of

56
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,040
the Wall Street Journal and I worked

57
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:07,618
with them to put together an article

58
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,719
about him and how it was the coming wave

59
00:02:07,618 --> 00:02:11,219
of the future and so forth and then uh

60
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:13,259
the I I arranged for them to do an

61
00:02:11,219 --> 00:02:16,020
interview with Jack Herer and so Jack

62
00:02:13,259 --> 00:02:18,000
when a reporter walked in Jack pulled

63
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:19,379
out a joint and started smoking it and

64
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,818
so instead of doing a whole article on

65
00:02:19,378 --> 00:02:23,159
hemp they decided to do a personality

66
00:02:20,818 --> 00:02:25,799
piece on Jack Herer the the Crusader for

67
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:26,939
him who smokes pot in front of reporters

68
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,319
um and so it was an interesting story

69
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:29,639
but it was rather disappointing to me

70
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:30,839
because I was not looking for a

71
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:32,939
personality piece at that point I was

72
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,439
looking for something major uh which it

73
00:02:32,939 --> 00:02:36,659
kind of was but it wasn't quite what I

74
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:37,800
wanted uh and we kept doing events here

75
00:02:36,659 --> 00:02:38,939
and there we found out that way if you

76
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,260
want to do a press conference you want

77
00:02:38,939 --> 00:02:42,000
to get the media to show up you promised

78
00:02:40,259 --> 00:02:43,859
them coffee and donuts you have a much

79
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,439
higher rate of having them show up than

80
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:49,319
if you don't and uh I remember one

81
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:50,818
particular event that we did where we uh

82
00:02:49,318 --> 00:02:52,919
had speakers coming from all over the

83
00:02:50,818 --> 00:02:55,560
country to uh I remember the Sacramento

84
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:57,299
or Los Angeles one of those you and uh

85
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,500
and you know with a lot of news coverage

86
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,239
a lot of cameras there and then we

87
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:02,699
watched the NewsHour report and they

88
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,080
basically didn't really cover what any

89
00:03:02,699 --> 00:03:05,639
of the speakers said or what we were

90
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,440
about they went around the edges that

91
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:08,759
they talked to people uh who were saying

92
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:11,818
well I don't know what this is all about

93
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:12,840
today uh and people who said well I

94
00:03:11,818 --> 00:03:14,158
don't think pop should be legalized

95
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,658
anyway who happened to walk by the

96
00:03:14,158 --> 00:03:17,699
street so it's like the news

97
00:03:15,658 --> 00:03:19,739
specifically ignored what we had to say

98
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:21,780
in order to cover people who look like

99
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:23,939
we didn't know what was going on

100
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:25,800
um and so uh my experience with the news

101
00:03:23,939 --> 00:03:27,719
media is that I talk to him a lot I

102
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:29,640
don't get mentioned very often but I

103
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:32,459
influence what happened in the Articles

104
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:34,378
and so forth and so uh that's one way of

105
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:36,239
getting some power out of things but we

106
00:03:34,378 --> 00:03:37,620
came to the conclusion that we wanted to

107
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,900
do a little bit more than that I know a

108
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:41,158
lot of people start magazines and uh

109
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:43,379
things just because they like the pretty

110
00:03:41,158 --> 00:03:44,818
pictures of pot and I know people like

111
00:03:43,378 --> 00:03:46,139
to do the radio shows which I like to do

112
00:03:44,818 --> 00:03:47,878
but I don't have the commitment to be

113
00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:50,039
there every week to do something like

114
00:03:47,878 --> 00:03:51,780
that so uh I got together with a guy

115
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:54,120
named Richard Lee who's the founder of

116
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:56,400
Oaks Dam University and uh another

117
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,500
fellow and we put together the Oaks Dam

118
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:02,099
news which was a quarterly newspaper

119
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:03,959
from nine from 2005 to 2007.

120
00:04:02,098 --> 00:04:05,158
um and we were quite effective accepting

121
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:06,598
that the thing is we have a lot of

122
00:04:05,158 --> 00:04:08,579
different approaches because Richard

123
00:04:06,598 --> 00:04:10,139
didn't want us to put anything uh any

124
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:12,900
bad news in the paper he wanted to all

125
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:14,699
be good news and uh to me I think you

126
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:16,199
just really can't ignore the amount of

127
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:17,699
bad news that's going on so we had this

128
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:19,379
kind of a Perpetual little conflict

129
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:21,180
about how he cast all the Articles

130
00:04:19,379 --> 00:04:22,639
fortunately that was saved on a third

131
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:26,100
partner went off and took the money

132
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:27,960
bankrupted us so uh yeah we didn't have

133
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:30,060
to argue about that anymore but uh

134
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:31,379
luckily my wife Mickey Norris uh I took

135
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:33,060
me a year to convince her that we really

136
00:04:31,379 --> 00:04:34,680
needed to make progress with the

137
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:37,199
newspaper again so we came up with the

138
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:39,540
West Coast leaf and um what we cover in

139
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,800
every issue is we want to have uh

140
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:43,319
articles from all over the country

141
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,639
primarily on the West Coast uh we want

142
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:47,279
to have photos from all over the place

143
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,418
we want to cover events all over but

144
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:49,978
mainly what we're trying to do is to

145
00:04:48,418 --> 00:04:51,478
spread information about who's doing

146
00:04:49,978 --> 00:04:53,039
what what they're achieving and how

147
00:04:51,478 --> 00:04:54,180
other people can do something similar in

148
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,740
their area and if they want to get

149
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:57,540
involved with an issue who do they talk

150
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:59,460
to and how do they become activists

151
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:01,439
because the function of our newspaper

152
00:04:59,459 --> 00:05:02,819
unlike most newspapers which is to kind

153
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:04,860
of give you something to read over your

154
00:05:02,819 --> 00:05:06,300
coffee our function is to give you

155
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:07,860
something that you can then get pissed

156
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:09,120
off enough about that you decide to go

157
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:10,979
home and do something about it you have

158
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,840
very specific things that you can do

159
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:13,918
about it and you know the names of the

160
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:15,299
people to do it and you know the name of

161
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:17,099
the Court ruling that might affect your

162
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:18,780
life and you know the recent decisions

163
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:20,879
that have been happening on the State

164
00:05:18,779 --> 00:05:22,918
Legislative level on the national level

165
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:24,600
and so forth and I think that's

166
00:05:22,918 --> 00:05:26,639
extremely important because let me just

167
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,020
take the case of Obama right now

168
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,639
um there's a lot of people who feel very

169
00:05:28,019 --> 00:05:31,500
disillusioned with what Barack Obama as

170
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:32,759
President somebody said to me well he's

171
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,019
the best president that they'll let us

172
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:35,038
have you know if he was any better than

173
00:05:34,019 --> 00:05:37,560
that they would have killed him by now

174
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:39,300
so whether that's true or not I don't

175
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,918
know but I do know that a lot of people

176
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,660
I talk to are quite disillusioned with

177
00:05:40,918 --> 00:05:44,339
him and yet if you really find follow

178
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:46,979
what's going on with Barack Obama on our

179
00:05:44,339 --> 00:05:48,959
issue in particular you find that he has

180
00:05:46,978 --> 00:05:50,779
delivered in Spades like no other

181
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:54,239
president that we have ever had before

182
00:05:50,779 --> 00:05:55,978
Obama came forward yeah he deserves a

183
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,538
big hand right now because whatever he's

184
00:05:55,978 --> 00:05:58,740
done elsewhere the five from the fact

185
00:05:57,538 --> 00:06:00,779
that he's bringing the troops out of

186
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:02,280
Iraqi as he promised on Automation in

187
00:06:00,779 --> 00:06:03,959
particular he the first thing he did

188
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:07,079
soon after taking office was he had his

189
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:09,060
uh he announced that uh Eric Holder

190
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:10,800
would be his uh attorney general and

191
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:12,899
Eric Holder did a statement that we're

192
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,600
going to follow the promise to and the

193
00:06:12,899 --> 00:06:16,918
medical marijuana raids like Rob and of

194
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,060
course then the DEA rated a bunch of

195
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:20,099
places the next day to say we don't care

196
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:21,899
what the president does well soon after

197
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:23,460
that they got the the memo on factual

198
00:06:21,899 --> 00:06:25,500
science we said that they have to use

199
00:06:23,459 --> 00:06:27,000
science instead of political beliefs as

200
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,740
a basis of their decisions which is a

201
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,600
huge threat to the DEA as you were

202
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:32,579
hearing the DEA is they're using lies to

203
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,840
keep marijuana illegal the president has

204
00:06:32,579 --> 00:06:36,180
ordered them they have to redo their

205
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:38,758
work based upon scientific accuracy the

206
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:39,840
president then came back and and issued

207
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:40,979
a memo saying that the federal

208
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:43,679
government does not have the right to

209
00:06:40,978 --> 00:06:45,060
preempt States on criminal laws and so

210
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,740
forth and in fact the state should be

211
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:48,538
encouraged to diversify from the federal

212
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:50,819
policies in order to create greater

213
00:06:48,538 --> 00:06:53,219
experimentation he quoted uh government

214
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:55,259
excuse me Supreme Court Justice Brandeis

215
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:57,539
that the states that are laboratory for

216
00:06:55,259 --> 00:06:59,699
democracy and he brought that out and so

217
00:06:57,538 --> 00:07:01,439
he again told the government to the DEA

218
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:02,639
to leave us alone and then still that

219
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:04,740
your raids continued and then he in

220
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:07,019
October last year he issued the memo

221
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:08,340
which said specifically that the eea is

222
00:07:07,019 --> 00:07:11,099
supposed to lead people alone in states

223
00:07:08,339 --> 00:07:12,659
where uh who are compliant with the

224
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:15,060
State medical marijuana laws in their

225
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:16,500
states and so uh you know we've got this

226
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:18,120
long track record of it and as you may

227
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:20,160
have heard recently the Veterans

228
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,959
Administration has changed their policy

229
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:26,000
to allow veterans to use medical

230
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:26,000
marijuana in states where it's legal

231
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:31,800
if you thought George Bush would let

232
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:33,060
that happen if you think John McCain

233
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,620
would have let that happen if you think

234
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:36,839
Sarah Palin would have let that happen

235
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:38,220
you've got some rethinking to do and so

236
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:39,119
uh you know we have to recognize these

237
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:41,039
things and we have to be putting into

238
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,180
the front because what the opposition is

239
00:07:41,038 --> 00:07:44,459
trying to do is make us feel

240
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:46,019
disillusioned with Obama and disillusion

241
00:07:44,459 --> 00:07:47,339
with the Democrats so that we let the

242
00:07:46,019 --> 00:07:48,478
Republicans come back and take power

243
00:07:47,339 --> 00:07:49,918
again I'm not taking this from a

244
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:51,300
partisan point of view I'm taking for

245
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:53,219
the point of view of who has delivered

246
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,660
what that does good for us who came

247
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,800
through with the healthcare program who

248
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:57,720
came through with these decisions about

249
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,098
allowing for medical marijuana who came

250
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:01,020
through for us over and over again who's

251
00:07:59,098 --> 00:08:02,339
pulling out of Iraq it's the Democrats

252
00:08:01,019 --> 00:08:04,680
and so for the people who say all

253
00:08:02,339 --> 00:08:06,598
politicians are alike is the same is to

254
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:09,000
fall into the lies of being put forth by

255
00:08:06,598 --> 00:08:12,180
Rupert Murdoch and that spewing's not

256
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,860
says a factory known as Fox News now we

257
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:15,000
have a similar issue on when it comes to

258
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,860
the West Coast leaf and I'm going to

259
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,478
encourage everyone to take a copy which

260
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:20,460
is that we have a situation in

261
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:21,959
California right now over Prop 19 where

262
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:23,878
some people who are making money off of

263
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:25,198
the current situation like to project it

264
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:27,240
that somehow there's something thing so

265
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,800
terribly flawed about Prop 19 that we

266
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,418
even though we use marijuana should be

267
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,099
voting against it and a lot of this is

268
00:08:30,418 --> 00:08:34,439
based upon one thing is a guy named

269
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:36,060
Dennis perone good friend of mine who

270
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,979
decided to take upon himself to spread

271
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:39,598
false information about the initiative

272
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:41,038
but because he was still known within

273
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,959
the medical marijuana circles people

274
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:44,819
just believed it and in fact it's gotten

275
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:46,259
into the New York excuse me the Los

276
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:48,360
Angeles Times and it's gotten into

277
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:50,278
sacramental news that this law will

278
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:52,680
create new felonies that is absolutely

279
00:08:50,278 --> 00:08:55,019
factually a lie it is false information

280
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:56,639
and but the news media because Dennis

281
00:08:55,019 --> 00:08:57,899
Barone who was their their hero of

282
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:59,819
medical marijuana is saying it they

283
00:08:57,899 --> 00:09:01,740
don't recheck and read the initiative to

284
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:03,060
find out what it really says and so one

285
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,440
of the things that people say to us oh

286
00:09:03,059 --> 00:09:05,759
we should get both sides of the argument

287
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,980
well I'll tell you what we do not

288
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:09,480
publish lies there's plenty of people

289
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,980
publishing lives out there if you want

290
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,778
to get the government side of lies about

291
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:13,980
the initiative you go to any other

292
00:09:12,778 --> 00:09:15,720
newspaper and they will tell you the

293
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:17,159
government's lies our job is to screen

294
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,420
it out and make sure that what you're

295
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:20,519
getting is accurate and so you're not

296
00:09:18,419 --> 00:09:22,259
going to get Dennis perone's fake idea

297
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:23,580
of what the initiative does when you

298
00:09:22,259 --> 00:09:24,720
read the West Coast League you're going

299
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:26,580
to find out what the initiative really

300
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,720
does when you read our newspaper if we

301
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:29,700
make a mistake we're going to come back

302
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,320
to next issue and clean it up and let

303
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,759
you know what that mistake was we're not

304
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,680
going to feed you a bunch of stuff so

305
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:36,120
then your question is how do you benefit

306
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:38,219
from the work that we're willing to put

307
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:39,839
in and this is how you do it you write

308
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:41,879
us an article that tells us what you're

309
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,860
doing you do it with a news hook you

310
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:45,059
give us a good photograph that shows us

311
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:46,860
something going on and a nice little

312
00:09:45,059 --> 00:09:48,539
caption that explains it but you have to

313
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,759
write in good plain English I'm talking

314
00:09:48,539 --> 00:09:52,139
about a direct

315
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:54,179
declaratory sentence I want to start off

316
00:09:52,139 --> 00:09:55,799
with somebody did something important

317
00:09:54,179 --> 00:09:57,299
and this is why it's important to you

318
00:09:55,799 --> 00:09:59,399
and they did it on such of a date and

319
00:09:57,299 --> 00:10:01,259
where they did it I don't want

320
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:02,458
October the 5th was a historic day for

321
00:10:01,259 --> 00:10:03,899
people all over the world who'd like to

322
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:05,579
smoke pots and then the greatest it's

323
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:07,919
like you know hello I want to know what

324
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:09,480
happened you know every day of historic

325
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:11,519
day because the next day it's gone you

326
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,539
know it's not that it's a historic day

327
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:14,519
that's important and what we need to

328
00:10:12,539 --> 00:10:15,838
know is what really happened and we also

329
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:17,759
I know people like to write stuff in

330
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,440
very round about couched ways I just

331
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:21,539
like to say the more specific the more

332
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,920
direct the more clear you can be the

333
00:10:21,539 --> 00:10:24,899
more likely you are to get your report

334
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:26,879
into our paper if you get into our hands

335
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:28,200
we're going to put it out 150 000 plus

336
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:29,338
copies we're going to get spread all

337
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,080
around the country and other

338
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:33,300
Publications read ours and then they

339
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:35,220
cover it for example the story about the

340
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:36,539
airports in California that don't uh

341
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:38,339
that'll let people fly with medical

342
00:10:36,539 --> 00:10:40,559
marijuana now we're the ones who wrote

343
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:42,060
that story and and we also we wrote one

344
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:44,278
story about a guy who had been framed by

345
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:46,139
the cops and the cop who was we've said

346
00:10:44,278 --> 00:10:48,059
was involved in framing him then went

347
00:10:46,139 --> 00:10:49,620
and helped the guy get out so that he

348
00:10:48,059 --> 00:10:51,659
would not be so that people would not

349
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:53,639
think he was a bad guy because his

350
00:10:51,659 --> 00:10:54,778
people reading the West Coast leave that

351
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:56,578
he was being an and they told

352
00:10:54,778 --> 00:10:58,200
him that they've been an and he

353
00:10:56,578 --> 00:11:00,000
actually went and helped out the guy

354
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,379
that we had reported that he's screwed

355
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,078
over and he said I didn't really mean

356
00:11:01,379 --> 00:11:06,000
for that to happen so you know the power

357
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:07,500
is right right here and we get the

358
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,059
information from you so I've got to stop

359
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,139
but please keep giving us your articles

360
00:11:09,059 --> 00:11:11,099
we're going to make sure that they get

361
00:11:10,139 --> 00:11:12,000
out to the rest of the world and we're

362
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:15,320
going to make sure they think it's the

363
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,320
true story not the

364
00:11:15,419 --> 00:11:20,000
all right thank you Chris Conrad
