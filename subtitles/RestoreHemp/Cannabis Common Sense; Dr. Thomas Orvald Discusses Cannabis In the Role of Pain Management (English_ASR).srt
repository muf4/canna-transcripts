1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:05,160
you want to talk about the breadth of

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,318
different patients and the type of

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:09,480
patients you see in this I know you had

4
00:00:07,318 --> 00:00:11,699
practiced as a cardiac surgeon for about

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:14,638
40 years so you'd see people who needed

6
00:00:11,699 --> 00:00:17,278
a heart transplant or I know in one case

7
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:19,019
we were seeing patients in Spokane and a

8
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:21,539
fellow said you had taken a bullet out

9
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:24,480
of his heart about 10 years before that

10
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:26,160
so uh but in in this case you're seeing

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,640
patients that are different from the

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,500
typical cardiac patient

13
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,179
no question that

14
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,640
um

15
00:00:32,179 --> 00:00:38,280
to have your hand inside a chest around

16
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,480
a beating heart is an extraordinary

17
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,179
experience

18
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:44,878
and I think it was one of these

19
00:00:42,179 --> 00:00:49,079
experiences that kind of lit the fire if

20
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:52,378
you will for me uh and for the future of

21
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:54,719
the use of something like cannabis

22
00:00:52,378 --> 00:00:57,119
and I wonder if I could just say a few

23
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,460
words of Paul about one of the things

24
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:02,099
that arises to the surface please

25
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,600
especially when we see people in the

26
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:07,439
clinics

27
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:11,579
we are seeing many many people who are

28
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:12,679
coming in with problems associated with

29
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:16,438
pain

30
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:19,380
and this is a very important subject

31
00:01:16,438 --> 00:01:22,798
that needs to be discussed in the

32
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:23,640
medical field as well as the Cannabis

33
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:28,740
field

34
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:33,680
people who are become uh

35
00:01:28,739 --> 00:01:37,199
over users of Narcotics and opiates are

36
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:40,799
frequently seen in our clinics and it's

37
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,618
in large part because of the

38
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:46,920
inappropriate

39
00:01:42,618 --> 00:01:50,340
giving of Narcotics to patients by

40
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:52,618
physicians and we see this constantly

41
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:56,700
and here we have this incredible

42
00:01:52,618 --> 00:02:00,239
medication which can be used properly

43
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:03,420
can be very helpful in getting people

44
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:05,879
off of the use of Narcotics and opiates

45
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:08,280
and this is one area that we work

46
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:10,439
diligently on

47
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,598
yeah I've seen the vast majority of

48
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:15,780
patients that come through with chronic

49
00:02:12,598 --> 00:02:18,119
pain issues who have been Addicted by

50
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:22,140
their Physicians to these things from

51
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:24,539
Oxycontin to Morphine to many forms of

52
00:02:22,139 --> 00:02:27,059
synthetic narcotics

53
00:02:24,539 --> 00:02:30,359
I would say about 80 percent of them

54
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:32,039
completely get off of those narcotics by

55
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,840
the time they come in for their renewal

56
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:36,479
the next year that's cool that's

57
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,759
accurate and it may be 10 have

58
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:41,159
dramatically reduced it and the other

59
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:44,878
maybe five percent five to ten percent

60
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:48,180
have have continued it but cannabis has

61
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:50,579
been used by literally hundreds of

62
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:52,500
thousands of people to help quit their

63
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:55,080
Addiction in fact you know we show these

64
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:56,639
medicinal bottles on our TV show all the

65
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,560
time and one of the things that it says

66
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:01,279
on the bottles is it's for the

67
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,840
habituates of opiates

68
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:06,120
chloroform

69
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:08,280
cocaine alcoholics with delirium tremens

70
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,500
to help them get off all of those drugs

71
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:12,060
so it's been acknowledged as an aid in

72
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,459
that for many many years and even

73
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:15,780
nicotine yeah yeah nicotine we've got

74
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:17,759
Alpha nicotine

75
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:20,340
frequently

76
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:24,079
you can attach yourself

77
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:26,219
to something that moves you uh beyond

78
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:29,959
the average

79
00:03:26,219 --> 00:03:33,658
and I think being a part of medicine

80
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:36,060
enabled me to do this first of all with

81
00:03:33,658 --> 00:03:37,979
the thing I loved so much was was taking

82
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:39,598
care of human

83
00:03:37,979 --> 00:03:44,518
hearts

84
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:47,579
and then when that times slip slided

85
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:51,480
away I could come in and continue to

86
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:55,260
work with humans and their hearts but in

87
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:57,598
a different way by advising them about

88
00:03:55,259 --> 00:04:01,798
how they can take care of their bodies

89
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:04,579
how they can avoid taking and eating the

90
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:08,459
wrong things and the wrong medications

91
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:12,560
and I think I've been able to realize a

92
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:12,560
a second coming if you will
