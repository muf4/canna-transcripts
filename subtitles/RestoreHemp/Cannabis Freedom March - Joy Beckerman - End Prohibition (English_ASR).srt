1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:08,279
we had two bills this year SB of uh 5012

2
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:10,199
and hb1552 for industrial hemp we

3
00:00:08,279 --> 00:00:12,779
suggested the most minimal possible

4
00:00:10,199 --> 00:00:15,000
regulations that we could suggest in

5
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:16,378
order to maintain the Integrity of an of

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,940
an industrial hemp crop with the

7
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:20,039
sophisticated markets that exists today

8
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,380
and to be compliant with the new

9
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:24,000
legitimacy of industrial hemp research

10
00:00:22,379 --> 00:00:28,198
act that was passed on a federal level

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,179
in February of 2014. however our minimal

12
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:31,560
regulations were too minimal for the

13
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:33,420
Washington State Department of

14
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:36,000
Agriculture who have inserted themselves

15
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:38,760
into the regulatory process and

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,799
requested multiple amendments to our

17
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:43,500
minimal regulations that they then

18
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:45,419
projected with a fiscal note of nine

19
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,039
hundred thousand dollars in order to

20
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,800
administer an industrial hemp program

21
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,238
here agriculturally for our state it

22
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:53,159
will cost nowhere near nine hundred

23
00:00:51,238 --> 00:00:56,399
thousand dollars for them to administer

24
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:58,558
a reasonable compliant Industrial Hemp

25
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,480
program in our state but they wanted

26
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:02,419
their hands in the testing of hemp they

27
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:06,359
wanted their hands in the testing of of

28
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:08,099
uh of the hemp in certain Labs the

29
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:11,219
reality is that the liquor control board

30
00:01:08,099 --> 00:01:13,379
does not oversee marijuana testing the

31
00:01:11,219 --> 00:01:15,179
marijuana producers take their own test

32
00:01:13,379 --> 00:01:17,158
sample they bring it to a third party

33
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:19,740
authorized testing facility and their

34
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:21,359
lab set all through our state and

35
00:01:19,739 --> 00:01:24,060
everything is done by third party

36
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:26,819
authorized folks and with producers who

37
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:27,900
take their own sample the wsda the

38
00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:30,000
Washington State Department of

39
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:33,540
Agriculture insisted that they had to be

40
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,340
present to see an industrial hemp sample

41
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:37,320
collected now I want you to know in

42
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:40,859
Canada they've had legal Industrial Hemp

43
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:43,919
since 1998 it's a booming industry

44
00:01:40,859 --> 00:01:45,539
we buy 90 of the industrial hemp seeds

45
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,340
and hemp seed oil and other derivatives

46
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:49,680
that come from the proteins of the hemp

47
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:52,618
plant from Canada Health Canada which

48
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:55,079
governs the industrial hemp program in

49
00:01:52,618 --> 00:01:56,879
that country does not oversee the

50
00:01:55,078 --> 00:01:58,978
testing they do not go out into the

51
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:00,719
fields and collect tests in fact it's

52
00:01:58,978 --> 00:02:02,938
actually a revenue generator they

53
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:05,640
authorize professional agrologists to

54
00:02:02,938 --> 00:02:07,618
become licensed field Samplers and the

55
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,659
farmer pays a couple of hundred dollars

56
00:02:07,618 --> 00:02:11,759
in many cases less to have a third party

57
00:02:09,659 --> 00:02:15,000
come out and take their test once a year

58
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:17,039
collect a sample of plants and then take

59
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,360
it to a third-party testing facility and

60
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:20,639
health Canada doesn't deal with that

61
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:22,920
they don't bear the expense of that they

62
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:25,019
don't Supply the human resources and the

63
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:26,759
mass spectrometers and the gas chromatic

64
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:28,800
graphs required for all of that testing

65
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:30,659
that's hundreds of thousands of dollars

66
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,340
the liquor control board doesn't do it

67
00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:35,340
either here and here we're talking about

68
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:37,439
marijuana not even a non-drug oil seed

69
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:39,360
and fiber crop but the Washington State

70
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:41,818
Department of Agriculture decided nope

71
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,340
we need to see the tests that the sample

72
00:02:41,818 --> 00:02:46,199
actually being collected we need to test

73
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,640
that sample ourselves and invest in

74
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:49,560
hundreds of thousands of dollars of

75
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:51,000
cannabis testing equipment and therefore

76
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,459
it's going to cost almost a million

77
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,840
dollars Which is far too much for an

78
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:57,060
industrial hemp crop that we don't think

79
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,939
is going to earn any money so right now

80
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:02,939
even though we have two live bills even

81
00:02:59,939 --> 00:03:04,378
alive still in our special session they

82
00:03:02,939 --> 00:03:06,840
are both stalled at the House

83
00:03:04,378 --> 00:03:09,060
Appropriations Committee level and the

84
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,459
Washington have Industries Association

85
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:14,878
is working overtime providing economic

86
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:17,939
data and other evidence to prove to them

87
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:20,158
that their projection of Regulation is

88
00:03:17,939 --> 00:03:22,800
far far more expensive than it needs to

89
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:25,079
be why it is and how much money there is

90
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,480
to be made with industrial home

91
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:29,040
so we would really appreciate it if you

92
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:32,098
folks would join and all you need to do

93
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:33,780
is go to join hemp.net to become a

94
00:03:32,098 --> 00:03:35,818
supporting member of the Washington hemp

95
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:37,800
Industries Association it's only 50 a

96
00:03:35,818 --> 00:03:40,439
year to become a supporting member we

97
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:43,140
have got to clean up carbon carbon

98
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:45,780
emissions here we have got to clean up

99
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:48,298
heavy pesticide use heavy water use

100
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:50,519
heavy fertilizer use we are ruining the

101
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:52,560
land we are ruining the soil we have

102
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:55,319
already all but destroyed the American

103
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,900
farm and the farming industry Industrial

104
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:59,639
Hemp will re-energize that and will also

105
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,680
bring Health not only to our lands and

106
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:04,559
our soils and our Waters but to our

107
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:08,459
biosphere to our climate

108
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,900
I also am very honored to sit on the

109
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:12,598
board for the center for the study of

110
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:15,900
cannabis and social policy as well as

111
00:04:12,598 --> 00:04:18,000
the normal women of Washington and I am

112
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:20,459
involved with compliance and law I've

113
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,680
had a dual career over the last 20 years

114
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:25,860
or so in complex civil litigation and

115
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:28,860
compliance and I wanted to make sure

116
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:30,660
folks realize that in this SB 5052 that

117
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:33,360
has passed that has Stripped Away many

118
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:34,939
of the rights that patients have been

119
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,560
enjoying in the state of Washington

120
00:04:34,939 --> 00:04:40,800
since the voters spoke overwhelmingly in

121
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:42,120
1998 to to legalize the medical use of

122
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,280
marijuana

123
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,500
it used to be that folks that held

124
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:48,599
medical marijuana authorization patients

125
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:51,000
who depend on the staple plant medicine

126
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,919
to manage a variety of medical

127
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,800
conditions and quality of life issues

128
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:58,019
everything from glaucoma to Multiple

129
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,699
Sclerosis to wasting syndrome to chronic

130
00:04:58,019 --> 00:05:01,079
pain syndrome to a variety of terminal

131
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:03,840
illnesses

132
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:05,698
they used to be able to grow 15 plants

133
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:09,359
themselves those who had to those who

134
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:12,000
could now if they voluntarily register

135
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,860
which many folks do view as a HIPAA or a

136
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,199
privacy right violation that we would

137
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:18,720
need to register for our medic our

138
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:20,520
medicine put our names on a list those

139
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,580
folks will be able to grow six plants

140
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:25,319
now not 15. and if you don't volunteer

141
00:05:23,579 --> 00:05:27,478
to be on the registry you'll only be

142
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:30,120
able to grow four plants as a patient

143
00:05:27,478 --> 00:05:31,978
instead of six now the reason for 15 is

144
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:34,978
of course for those of you who depend on

145
00:05:31,978 --> 00:05:36,719
this safe whole plant medicine for your

146
00:05:34,978 --> 00:05:39,300
conditions or for your quality of life

147
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,479
oftentimes 15 plants are required to

148
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:44,038
produce the actual quantity of medicine

149
00:05:41,478 --> 00:05:46,560
that would be needed to manage a health

150
00:05:44,038 --> 00:05:48,478
condition most folks who have a serious

151
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,819
illness don't consume by smoking

152
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:52,680
marijuana they consume it by eating it

153
00:05:50,819 --> 00:05:55,079
or ingesting it requires more plant

154
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:56,939
material collectives used to be able to

155
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:58,918
have 10 members they'll go down to four

156
00:05:56,939 --> 00:06:01,019
members now that this law has been

157
00:05:58,918 --> 00:06:02,579
passed additionally

158
00:06:01,019 --> 00:06:04,680
we've been able to go to these medical

159
00:06:02,579 --> 00:06:06,899
marijuana clinics to get our medical

160
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:09,900
marijuana authorizations those who have

161
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:11,819
qualifying conditions medical marijuana

162
00:06:09,899 --> 00:06:13,679
clinics as we know them will be

163
00:06:11,819 --> 00:06:16,459
dissolved by law in two and a half

164
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:19,560
months July 23rd of

165
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:22,198
2015. that's this year that's this

166
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:23,819
summer all medical marijuana clinics as

167
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:26,759
we know them will be dissolved by law

168
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:29,580
and guess who is left to authorize your

169
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:32,340
use of marijuana for medicine your

170
00:06:29,579 --> 00:06:34,918
primary care provider I'd like you to

171
00:06:32,339 --> 00:06:36,779
ask yourself How likely is your primary

172
00:06:34,918 --> 00:06:39,719
care provider to issue you an

173
00:06:36,779 --> 00:06:42,839
authorization for medical marijuana this

174
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:45,000
is actually a place where activists and

175
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:46,918
patients and people who believe in the

176
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,660
freedom of this plant need to work with

177
00:06:46,918 --> 00:06:50,099
their clinics need to work with their

178
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:52,259
medical providers need to work with

179
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:54,600
their Primary Care Providers to tell

180
00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:56,879
them not only is the huge need here and

181
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:59,580
to give them information and hard data

182
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:02,699
that they need easily found on multiple

183
00:06:59,579 --> 00:07:05,579
websites across the the World Wide Web

184
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:06,538
also let them know there is money to be

185
00:07:05,579 --> 00:07:09,120
made

186
00:07:06,538 --> 00:07:10,918
you are going to have to work on that we

187
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,780
have to work on the economic aspects of

188
00:07:10,918 --> 00:07:15,359
industrial Health all the time we have

189
00:07:12,779 --> 00:07:18,299
to dangle the carrot of money in order

190
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:20,220
to get people to buy into it it's also

191
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:22,918
how we're ending the drug war with money

192
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:24,900
proving that these billions of dollars

193
00:07:22,918 --> 00:07:28,318
have done nothing but let the black

194
00:07:24,899 --> 00:07:30,439
market flourish while we have continued

195
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:33,660
drug uh addiction

196
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:35,819
amazing statistics of drug addiction and

197
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:36,780
crime superseding most other parts of

198
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:38,460
the world right here in the United

199
00:07:36,779 --> 00:07:40,799
States the last thing I want to tell you

200
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:43,859
is that medical marijuana dispensaries

201
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:46,139
as we know them will be dissolved by law

202
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:48,780
unless we can get some sensible

203
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:52,379
legislation or initiative pass by July

204
00:07:48,779 --> 00:07:54,538
of 2016. so next summer right now

205
00:07:52,379 --> 00:07:56,279
eligible existing medical marijuana

206
00:07:54,538 --> 00:07:58,918
dispensaries are being asked now to

207
00:07:56,279 --> 00:08:00,899
apply for a medical endorsement not from

208
00:07:58,918 --> 00:08:03,659
the Department of Health from the liquor

209
00:08:00,899 --> 00:08:05,818
control board a medical endorsement from

210
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:07,680
the liquor control board and those that

211
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:09,539
actually make it through The Gauntlet of

212
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,280
compliance issues which will no doubt

213
00:08:09,538 --> 00:08:13,318
move and each compliance Target will

214
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:14,698
change as the process goes on they will

215
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:16,740
then be allowed to be rolled into

216
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:19,139
existing recreational marijuana stores

217
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:20,879
