1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:04,919
well and whatever's going on in this

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:08,759
dimensional

3
00:00:04,919 --> 00:00:10,400
reality will never outfight them it's

4
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:13,480
about outthinking

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:18,079
them it's about outthinking

6
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:21,079
them just think about that right about

7
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:21,079
out thinking

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:30,480
that Alternative Energy power power

9
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:34,840
Alternative Energy conscious life

10
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:38,159
thought the process of thinking

11
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:42,000
energy we are the alternative energy

12
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:44,479
that can make the change to happen but

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,759
we really have to understand what this

14
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:49,558
means we really have to get it and

15
00:00:46,759 --> 00:00:52,439
understand it then we become that

16
00:00:49,558 --> 00:00:54,320
power the power of the people got have

17
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:56,718
[ __ ] to do with the vote or any other

18
00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:00,399
thing it's got to do with thinking with

19
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:03,239
a clear coherent intelligent mind use

20
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:06,400
the intelligence clearly in coherent how

21
00:01:03,238 --> 00:01:08,118
much power do we have can if you can you

22
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,759
make yourself feel miserable with your

23
00:01:08,118 --> 00:01:13,159
fears and your doubts and your

24
00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:17,799
insecurities if you can do that you have

25
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:20,159
power simply put all right so it's just

26
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:22,640
a matter but that's power used

27
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:25,200
incoherently and chaotically so just

28
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,640
think some mental shifts here and use

29
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,079
that power clearly and coherently and

30
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:33,280
real change

31
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:33,279
this is the power of the

32
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:40,399
people like this cannabis Tax Act you

33
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:43,359

34
00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:47,040
using it as a tool you know you just use

35
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:52,039
it as a tool but your power isn't

36
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,040
there the power isn't here
