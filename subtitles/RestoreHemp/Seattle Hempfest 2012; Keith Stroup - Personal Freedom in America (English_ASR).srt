1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,800
we favor the elimination of all

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,759
penalties for the responsible use of

3
00:00:03,799 --> 00:00:08,678
marijuana including the right to grow

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:10,800
your own marijuana and we further favor

5
00:00:08,679 --> 00:00:12,919
the eventual legalization of marijuana

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,480
consumers want the same thing consumers

7
00:00:12,919 --> 00:00:18,759
want in any other area we want a high

8
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:21,719
quality product that's affordable and

9
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:23,800
convenient and so we support eventually

10
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:26,239
full legalization I want to be able to

11
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:28,199
drive down to the local store and buy

12
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:30,759
some marijuana I want it to be tested I

13
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:32,559
want to know the strength of CBD THC and

14
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:35,920
I want to make make sure it doesn't have

15
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:39,280
any additives to it or pollutants in it

16
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:42,559
so we are the marijuana smokers Lobby in

17
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:45,640
America now the bad news is that we're

18
00:00:42,558 --> 00:00:48,078
still arresting 850,000 Americans a year

19
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:50,799
on marijuana charges there's another

20
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:53,079
marijuana smoker arrested every 38

21
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:56,399
seconds uh there have been more than 20

22
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:59,320
million Marijuana arrest just since

23
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:02,600
1965 and the real problem with that

24
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:04,680
policy is unlike alcohol where the

25
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,359
government differentiates between use

26
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,920
and abuse they don't arrest you if

27
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:11,400
you're an adult for using alcohol it's

28
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:14,400
only if you abuse it yet for marijuana

29
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:17,200
they act as if all use is abuse well

30
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,960
[ __ ] of course it's not so we need

31
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:22,118
to make that

32
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:24,719
distinction marijuana prohibition for

33
00:01:22,118 --> 00:01:27,319
two or three basic reasons is incredibly

34
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:30,519
self-destructive first off we're wasting

35
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:32,279
something like9 to 10 billion a year in

36
00:01:30,519 --> 00:01:34,239
law enforcement resources chasing

37
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:37,759
marijuana smokers when they should be

38
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:39,959
focused on serious and violent crime

39
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:42,280
secondly prohibition invites the

40
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:45,679
government into the privacy of your own

41
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:48,200
home where they know what books you read

42
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,200
they know what music you listen to uh

43
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:52,040
they know whether you how you conduct

44
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,880
yourself in the privacy of the bedroom

45
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:56,039
and they they know whether you drink

46
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:59,679
alcohol or smoke marijuana when you

47
00:01:56,039 --> 00:02:02,320
relax in the evening that's offensive to

48
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,479
the concept of right to privacy the

49
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:07,079
government has no business knowing

50
00:02:04,478 --> 00:02:10,159
whether we smoke or why we

51
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:12,719
smoke so where does that leave us well

52
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:15,878
the good news is that we've got three

53
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:17,400
National polls that show we now enjoy a

54
00:02:15,878 --> 00:02:20,598
the support of a majority of the

55
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:23,560
American public the gallop pole the year

56
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:27,359
we founded normal we only had 12%

57
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:31,280
Nationwide now we have 50% Galla poll

58
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:35,120
only 46% oppos a new r M poll I think

59
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:37,439
had 56% support a third poll had 52%

60
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,759
those are nationwide folks we have

61
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:42,639
largely won the hearts and minds of the

62
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:44,359
American people there was a Supreme

63
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:45,878
Court decision and I want to read this

64
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:49,800
simply because I don't want to get the

65
00:02:45,878 --> 00:02:52,799
language raw uh a couple of years ago in

66
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,800
which

67
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:58,119
oops Justice Anthony Kennedy in the case

68
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,719
called

69
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:04,360
um Lawrence Fe Texas said the following

70
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:07,400
at the heart of Liberty is the right to

71
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:09,959
Define one's own concept of existence of

72
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:13,039
meaning of the universe and of the

73
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:15,598
mystery of human life it is a promise of

74
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:18,199
the Constitution that there is a realm

75
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:22,000
of personal Liberty where the government

76
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:24,238
may not enter well folks we're about to

77
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,439
legalize marijuana you people in

78
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:29,560
Washington have an especially big role

79
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:32,000
to play there you vote for 502 and we're

80
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:34,319
going to send a message to Washington

81
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,280
that you don't have any choice but to

82
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:37,759
rethink your marijuana policy because

83
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39,039
there going to be a number of states are

84
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:42,120
saying the hell with you we're not going

85
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:44,359
to enforce it but in the end we're only

86
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:46,360
incidentally talking about marijuana

87
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:49,560
we're really talking about personal

88
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:53,200
freedom that area where government may

89
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:57,438
not go support 502 let's finally

90
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:57,438
legalize marijuana in America
