Retired Persons hello doctor tell us why

22
00:00:59,909 --> 00:01:05,518
you decided to be a chief petitioner to

23
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:07,500
regulate the sale of marijuana to adults

24
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,680
and allow doctors to prescribe it

25
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:14,938
through pharmacies I practice medicine

26
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:16,920
and Molalla and I found out either

27
00:01:14,938 --> 00:01:18,599
directly or indirectly that many of my

28
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,759
patients were not only used in my

29
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:23,459
prescriptions for the control of pain

30
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:26,280
but they were also smoking marijuana so

31
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:29,219
I did an investigation of my own and

32
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:32,070
found out that marijuana has been used

33
00:01:29,219 --> 00:01:34,078
for thousands of years and very

34
00:01:32,069 --> 00:01:36,868
effectively for a whole variety of

35
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:39,539
different kinds of problems would you
