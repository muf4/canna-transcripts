1
00:00:00,919 --> 00:00:08,080
you know I I think

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:12,559
marijuana is God's greatest gift to us I

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:14,519
think it's you know it can save our

4
00:00:12,558 --> 00:00:17,278
world a friend of mine John trell says

5
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:19,960
hemp is Earth medicine you know it's

6
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:24,278
missing for our bodies it helps us

7
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:27,278
achieve uh homeostasis where our body

8
00:00:24,278 --> 00:00:30,000
systems are aligned and it produces more

9
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:34,320
fuel more fiber more food than any other

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,200
PL on this planet you know the lot here

11
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:40,719
isn't good enough yet the the vote for

12
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:43,640
i502 is a big step forward but we need

13
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:46,399
to restore hemp and let people grow

14
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:48,359
their own unfortunately the current law

15
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:51,640
doesn't allow you to grow your own the

16
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:55,159
taxes are too high marijuana grows on

17
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:58,239
trees I personally grow 12T tall

18
00:00:55,159 --> 00:01:00,679
marijuana trees in Oregon and I give it

19
00:00:58,238 --> 00:01:02,878
away for free wo

20
00:01:00,679 --> 00:01:04,558
I enjoy that you know I give it to sick

21
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:07,399
and dying patients and I've been doing

22
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:11,118
it for years I call it America's most

23
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:12,920
public marijuana Garden but I do it all

24
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:17,118
organically

25
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:19,359
and it it saved many people's lives but

26
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:23,000
it's not just about the medicine you

27
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:26,239
know humans began cultivating marijuana

28
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,799
before history in prehistoric times and

29
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:31,438
all archaeologists agree that marijuana

30
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:34,118
hip could be the oldest crop purposely

31
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:38,438
grown by humans perhaps as much as

32
00:01:34,118 --> 00:01:41,478
35,000 years ago so it's the basis of

33
00:01:38,438 --> 00:01:44,000
the foundation of Agriculture and that

34
00:01:41,478 --> 00:01:48,640
means the foundation of civilization

35
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:51,560
itself so it produces more fuel over 300

36
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:56,039
gallons an acre they find from feral H

37
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:58,920
fields in Illinois oh more food 6,000

38
00:01:56,039 --> 00:02:01,200
lbs of hemp seed meals left over after

39
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:04,560
they pressed the oil out of it more

40
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:07,520
fiber 30 to 40 tons of fiber for canvas

41
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:10,878
rope lace linen paper and building

42
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:13,840
materials and more medicine for us and

43
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:16,799
the leaves go back into the soil the the

44
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,840
root draws up subsoil nutrients and

45
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,599
makes them available in the next crop

46
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:24,519
rotation and you know when we burn hemp

47
00:02:21,598 --> 00:02:27,759
fuel it's carbon negative we're taking

48
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:31,439
carbon out of the atmosphere to to make

49
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:35,000
it into fuel so him can really change

50
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:37,519
our whole economic Paradigm when we are

51
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,759
able to grow himp without regard to its

52
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:43,519
THC content but with regard to the the

53
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:46,560
varieties that produce the most seed oil

54
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:49,599
seed protein and stocks and stems for

55
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:52,120
fiber it'll change the whole economic

56
00:02:49,598 --> 00:02:56,000
Paradigm and instead of giving our money

57
00:02:52,120 --> 00:03:00,280
to Exxon and mobile and the Saudi uh

58
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,959
Sheiks and the Nigerian despots and and

59
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:06,000
the Swiss bank accounts it'll go to our

60
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:07,959
farmers and into our pockets and not our

61
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,919
communities you know marijuana

62
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:13,878
prohibition was never about

63
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:16,759
drugs marijuana prohibition and drugs is

64
00:03:13,878 --> 00:03:19,318
a smoke screen pardon the punk but

65
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:22,359
marijuana prohibition has always been

66
00:03:19,318 --> 00:03:25,479
about money power and the continued

67
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:28,400
centralization of Economic and political

68
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:32,318
control and we we in marijuana

69
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:35,000
prohibition and allow Farmers to grow HP

70
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:37,839
for fuel fiber food and medicine will

71
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,719
change the whole economic Paradigm and

72
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:43,640
take the money out of the hands of the

73
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:47,000
petrochemical pharmaceutical military

74
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:50,039
industrial transnational corporate Elite

75
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,919
fascist sons of a [ __ ] and we'll put

76
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:56,359
it in our pockets instead so get active

77
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:59,318
politically don't settle for what we

78
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:02,120
have work to make this world a better

79
00:03:59,318 --> 00:04:04,238
place please that is your mission please
