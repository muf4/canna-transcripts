63
00:03:08,979 --> 00:03:15,259
usefulness of cannabis you know we been

64
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:17,960
looking at some of our past shows and

65
00:03:15,259 --> 00:03:22,159
thought that we were having too many men

66
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:23,330
on it was just talking guys and we

67
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:25,430
thought that we needed to try to

68
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:27,440
encourage the women out there there's

69
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:29,409
females working too hard for this cause

70
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:32,919
that's right that's right and we need to

71
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:35,750
let you know that this is a diverse

72
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:37,129
movement that we're forming here isn't

73
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:39,740
that right yeah it takes everybody

74
00:03:37,129 --> 00:03:43,219
putting in what they think is their

75
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:46,400
talent like when I first started doing

76
00:03:43,219 --> 00:03:49,210
the activist work I thought well what do

77
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:52,789
I want to do I was fortunate enough to

78
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:55,240
at first start making hemp seed cookies

79
00:03:52,789 --> 00:03:57,739
it's actually the contest legal it

80
00:03:55,240 --> 00:04:00,980
actually is for bird seed but it's got

81
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:03,980
such a good nutty taste that I actually

82
00:04:00,979 --> 00:04:06,079
made these really good like raisin

83
00:04:03,979 --> 00:04:08,780
chocolate chip and hemp seed cookies

84
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,790
well one time read an event where I was

85
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:13,069
selling these like a bake sale but it

86
00:04:10,789 --> 00:04:15,259
was actually a part of another thing

87
00:04:13,069 --> 00:04:18,199
like musical

88
00:04:15,259 --> 00:04:21,918
and activities there was it was at Mount

89
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:24,770
Tabor pub actually what happened was I

90
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:28,069
was in the bathroom and a lady said to

91
00:04:24,769 --> 00:04:31,219
me wow did you taste those hemp seed

92
00:04:28,069 --> 00:04:32,930
cookies and I said yeah in fact I made

93
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:36,350
them so I knew that they turned out

94
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:38,629
really well and Donna here is also a

95
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:40,490
really good cook we do more than cook

96
00:04:38,629 --> 00:04:43,579
but we are putting our talents into

97
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:46,300
place she baked for our New Year's Eve

98
00:04:43,579 --> 00:04:49,339
benefit some really good like chocolate

99
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:53,449
would you like to go into what you made

100
00:04:49,339 --> 00:04:55,819
a little cheesecake everyone can

101
00:04:53,449 --> 00:04:57,949
appreciate you yeah they were great I

102
00:04:55,819 --> 00:05:00,500
thought you know the best I've ever

103
00:04:57,949 --> 00:05:03,110
tasted so actually I've been spending

104
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:04,910
most of my time lately working on the

105
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:07,310
referendum because we're so short of

106
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:09,949
time that's the present yes that was the

107
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:13,850
past and the cookies don't we only have

108
00:05:09,949 --> 00:05:16,370
until October third to get 48,000 is it

109
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:19,129
good 42,000 good signatures because we

110
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:22,220
need 48,000 will really need to turn in

111
00:05:19,129 --> 00:05:26,000
60 or 65 thousand right we've got enough

112
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:27,620
valid signatures so that's what I've

113
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,240
been spending most of my time on lately

114
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:32,180
I've discovered that not only can you

115
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:35,918
gather signatures at our usual place

116
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:38,569
saturday market I've done it on the bus

117
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:41,029
there's people out there who need to

118
00:05:38,569 --> 00:05:43,610
sign this because this is not just a

119
00:05:41,029 --> 00:05:46,668
matter of legalization the referendum is

120
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:49,699
to keep Oregon from going backwards in

121
00:05:46,668 --> 00:05:51,589
time to fit foot so things would be

122
00:05:49,699 --> 00:05:54,288
worse it would be more illegal than it

123
00:05:51,589 --> 00:05:58,788
is now yeah it's a regressive bill it

124
00:05:54,288 --> 00:06:00,709
does require the bill that the

125
00:05:58,788 --> 00:06:03,918
legislature passed that we're trying to

126
00:06:00,709 --> 00:06:09,519
force a vote on and hopefully we'll get

127
00:06:03,918 --> 00:06:11,899
the state to vote against that will

128
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:14,359
require the suspension of driver's

129
00:06:11,899 --> 00:06:16,459
licenses for six months if you're caught

130
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:19,000
with marijuana could be anywhere it

131
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:22,009
could be in your home it could be

132
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,839
wherever at a concert your driver's

133
00:06:22,009 --> 00:06:26,009
license will be suspended for six months

134
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:29,338
and it requires the

135
00:06:26,009 --> 00:06:32,369
mandatory diversion program so you'll

136
00:06:29,338 --> 00:06:35,939
have to go in for your analysis the drug

137
00:06:32,369 --> 00:06:38,849
counseling they'll probably make you

138
00:06:35,939 --> 00:06:40,528
enter a program all at your own expense

139
00:06:38,848 --> 00:06:42,209
that probably will cost two thousand

140
00:06:40,528 --> 00:06:44,459
dollars you can't get your driver's

141
00:06:42,209 --> 00:06:46,528
license back until you've done that so

142
00:06:44,459 --> 00:06:48,838
that's one aspect another aspect of the

143
00:06:46,528 --> 00:06:50,668
recrimination is that it allows the

144
00:06:48,838 --> 00:06:52,769
police to expand the powers of search

145
00:06:50,668 --> 00:06:54,718
and seizure in fact they said that was

146
00:06:52,769 --> 00:06:57,240
the main reason they wanted this this is

147
00:06:54,718 --> 00:06:59,218
a tool to law enforcement to expand the

148
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,658
powers of search and seizure so they

149
00:06:59,218 --> 00:07:04,348
could come in and seize your home your

150
00:07:00,658 --> 00:07:08,069
car your children and put you in in the

151
00:07:04,348 --> 00:07:10,319
grips of the ever-growing police state

152
00:07:08,069 --> 00:07:13,189
actually and so we're circulating our

153
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:20,249
petitions and we urge you to call us at

154
00:07:13,189 --> 00:07:22,080
235 for 606 that's 235 4606 yeah it's in

155
00:07:20,249 --> 00:07:24,629
these to you because really do need your

156
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:26,908
help this is the only way to stop the

157
00:07:24,629 --> 00:07:28,889
madness that's going on we're talking

158
00:07:26,908 --> 00:07:31,740
about one of the most beneficial useful

159
00:07:28,889 --> 00:07:36,389
plants on the planet I've also worked

160
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:39,180
with hemp paper that's been my passion I

161
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:42,240
worked with the company that sold tree

162
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:44,668
free paper and it prospered for a long

163
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:47,668
time but now I realize our goal will

164
00:07:44,668 --> 00:07:50,430
only be met if we can decentralize hemp

165
00:07:47,668 --> 00:07:52,859
and grow it here in our fields here in

166
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:54,870
Oregon that'll lower the cost that's for

167
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:56,699
sure that's for sure papers very heavy

168
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:59,129
you ship it around the world you've got

169
00:07:56,699 --> 00:08:02,038
a lot of shipping costs we have a

170
00:07:59,129 --> 00:08:03,838
beautiful forest here in Oregon and I

171
00:08:02,038 --> 00:08:06,269
can understand why you would want to cut

172
00:08:03,838 --> 00:08:09,718
down trees for timber for for use in

173
00:08:06,269 --> 00:08:11,879
construction but why when you have when

174
00:08:09,718 --> 00:08:13,800
you can use him why would anybody want

175
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:16,379
to cut down a tree just to make paper

176
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:18,478
hemp paper is much better anyway yeah

177
00:08:16,379 --> 00:08:21,180
that's true paper was invented from him

178
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:26,029
but and so we actually want to go back

179
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:28,009
to traditional production of paper and

180
00:08:26,029 --> 00:08:30,559
we're hoping to do that by allowing

181
00:08:28,009 --> 00:08:35,080
industrial hemp in the Oregon cannabis

182
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:38,809
Tax Act you know how else do you think

183
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:42,250
the marijuana prohibition specifically

184
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:46,819
impacts women and how else do you think

185
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:49,789
this issue is really important well I

186
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:52,370
think that a lot of women there probably

187
00:08:49,789 --> 00:08:54,949
are as many women that use marijuana as

188
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:59,600
there are men you never know that from

189
00:08:54,950 --> 00:09:02,930
going to normal meetings or from seeing

190
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:05,300
this show until now but women have got

191
00:09:02,929 --> 00:09:07,459
to come forward for one thing there's

192
00:09:05,299 --> 00:09:10,849
some specifically useful things for

193
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:13,730
women it's good for cramps it's good for

194
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:17,060
pms it makes you feel somewhat feel a

195
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:19,129
lot better I'm going into menopause

196
00:09:17,059 --> 00:09:21,559
myself and I found that it's been very

197
00:09:19,129 --> 00:09:26,929
useful for some of the symptoms of

198
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:28,939
menopause like hot flashes and right

199
00:09:26,929 --> 00:09:32,409
houses things that affect women

200
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:35,240
worldwide yeah in fact marijuana was

201
00:09:32,409 --> 00:09:37,879
prescribed to Queen Victoria for

202
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:42,200
menstrual cramps and things like that

203
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:44,409
and if you look in the pharmacopoeias up

204
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:47,720
until the middle of this century

205
00:09:44,409 --> 00:09:49,909
marijuana was prescribed for many

206
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:54,430
different ailments for dairy truck

207
00:09:49,909 --> 00:09:56,929
childbirth morning sickness cramps

208
00:09:54,429 --> 00:09:59,179
specifically it had a lot of usefulness

209
00:09:56,929 --> 00:10:00,769
with with depression that was the other

210
00:09:59,179 --> 00:10:03,109
thing I was trying to think of

211
00:10:00,769 --> 00:10:06,409
particularly it's a lot of menopausal

212
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:11,870
women get depressed easily and I think

213
00:10:06,409 --> 00:10:14,539
that it's very good for that yes plus I

214
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:16,370
believe it's a stress reliever actually

215
00:10:14,539 --> 00:10:22,339
stress is the number one killer in

216
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:25,610
America today so which do you choose so

217
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:29,930
you know we're trying to put this issue

218
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:31,580
on the ballot and I interrupt and say it

219
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:34,219
so often but I'll do it one more time

220
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:36,080
because somebody's out there channel

221
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:38,269
surfing across their cable channel that

222
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:39,129
are watching this we need to stress the

223
00:10:38,269 --> 00:10:41,139
fact that we

224
00:10:39,129 --> 00:10:43,240
due to call us you know we have our two

225
00:10:41,139 --> 00:10:45,669
petitions we're circulating the Oregon

226
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:48,070
cannabis Tax Act and the referendum to

227
00:10:45,669 --> 00:10:50,199
stop the recrimination of marijuana and

228
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:52,510
Oregon so we want to send those to you

229
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:55,870
we also have a newspaper we put out that

230
00:10:52,509 --> 00:10:58,120
is reprints of major articles dealing

231
00:10:55,870 --> 00:11:00,279
with this issue from around the country

232
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:02,139
and around the world it's called hemp

233
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:05,049
news and you can find that on the

234
00:11:02,139 --> 00:11:07,870
Internet to you can even download the

235
00:11:05,049 --> 00:11:14,079
petitions on the internet so you might

236
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:18,690
want to look at the website and pull the

237
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:26,139
petition right from there at wwc rrh org

238
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:27,850
that's that's one useful thing so how

239
00:11:26,139 --> 00:11:32,019
can we get more women involved in this

240
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:34,300
movement well I believe everyone has a

241
00:11:32,019 --> 00:11:36,579
talent what I chose to also to do

242
00:11:34,299 --> 00:11:40,539
besides making cookies was to get into

243
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:46,540
fundraising we held a benefit at the

244
00:11:40,539 --> 00:11:48,099
temple on 420 and I and a few others we

245
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:50,679
started off a small group four or five

246
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:54,190
people and then we grew we had a great

247
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:57,699
time we had trillion green come other

248
00:11:54,190 --> 00:12:00,910
living things the last debut of ground

249
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:02,470
score and I just think you know it's

250
00:12:00,909 --> 00:12:06,100
exciting there's so many different

251
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:08,920
aspects that you can help in which you

252
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:11,200
need to do is course contact us and tell

253
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:13,419
us what you want to do petitioning

254
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:16,750
obviously is the most important thing I

255
00:12:13,419 --> 00:12:19,689
do enjoy doing that also because you get

256
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:23,919
to interact with people for common cause

257
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:26,320
and I have you know had a lot of fun

258
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:31,059
basically just getting to know the

259
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:32,920
activist and i hope everyone out there

260
00:12:31,059 --> 00:12:36,189
that here's this message realizes that

261
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:38,529
you too can do something to help the

262
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:40,720
state of Oregon because this would also

263
00:12:38,529 --> 00:12:43,029
help bring in so much money for tax

264
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:46,720
revenue you know originally wanted to

265
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:48,649
fund schools with it but this time we're

266
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:51,980
just basically need

267
00:12:48,649 --> 00:12:54,259
it to be open for pharmaceutical

268
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:58,430
purposes for you know for doctors to

269
00:12:54,259 --> 00:13:00,709
prescribe it farmers and of course so we

270
00:12:58,429 --> 00:13:04,789
can grow it for paper and all the other

271
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:06,979
industrial uses yeah yeah so we urge you

272
00:13:04,789 --> 00:13:11,778
to give us a call once again the phone

273
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:16,909

helping with fundraising or events and

277
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:28,299

280
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:37,338
different ways that you could get active

281
00:13:34,789 --> 00:13:42,799
if you wanted to but the first step is

282

00:14:03,198 --> 00:14:07,549
say to people when I walk up to them are

329
00:15:31,068 --> 00:15:35,990
we're doing with these two petitions

330
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:38,420
right if you can get out there and help

331
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:41,028
us circulate it and you need to earn

332
00:15:38,419 --> 00:15:44,000
money and earn a living please do

333
00:15:41,028 --> 00:15:46,039
because we currently are paying on both

334
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,448
petitions now that doesn't mean that we

335
00:15:46,039 --> 00:15:48,919
don't want you to do it if you want to

336
00:15:47,448 --> 00:15:51,258
be a volunteer we want you to do it

337
00:15:48,919 --> 00:15:54,740
regardless we want everybody to do it

338
00:15:51,259 --> 00:15:57,259
yeah yeah I need everybody to do it yeah

339
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:59,299
I've discovered a lot of people out

340
00:15:57,259 --> 00:16:01,909
there will sign it they're seldom anyone

341
00:15:59,299 --> 00:16:03,679
who doesn't a lot of people even comment

342
00:16:01,909 --> 00:16:06,169
well I don't even smoke it but I just

343
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:10,008
think that it should be available

344
00:16:06,169 --> 00:16:14,149
especially to the medically ill and just

345
00:16:10,009 --> 00:16:16,789
on a general freedom basis yeah a lot of

346
00:16:14,149 --> 00:16:19,100
people say that the issue isn't drugs at

347
00:16:16,789 --> 00:16:21,769
all it's really freedom and that's why

348
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:24,500
we're out here working so hard at that

349
00:16:21,769 --> 00:16:27,649
you know I'm a volunteer personally as

350
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:29,328
is Teresa and Donna but that doesn't

351
00:16:27,649 --> 00:16:31,610
mean that we discourage anyone from

352
00:16:29,328 --> 00:16:33,919
going out there and earning money we've

353
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:36,278
all got bills to pay and if you want to

354
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:38,568
go and earn money in a good way

355
00:16:36,278 --> 00:16:40,639
circulating our petitions is one way to

356
00:16:38,568 --> 00:16:43,128
do it now you know our campaign has been

357
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:46,220
a totally volunteer one up until now

358
00:16:43,129 --> 00:16:49,000
it's been completely volunteer until

359
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:51,500
just the past month in mid-july when

360
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,058
some folks came forward and pledged some

361
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:55,549
money so that we can begin paying

362
00:16:53,058 --> 00:16:58,338
petitioners but now that we can we urge

363
00:16:55,549 --> 00:17:03,979
everyone that needs work to give us a

364
00:16:58,339 --> 00:17:06,500

365
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:09,019

367
00:17:09,019 --> 00:17:14,568

369
00:17:14,568 --> 00:17:17,059
are

370
00:17:15,019 --> 00:17:18,889
happening it's called temp news it's

371
00:17:17,059 --> 00:17:26,838
also available as I think I said earlier

372
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:28,310
on our webpage at wwc r rho RG but it's

373
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:30,500
just important that you get involved

374
00:17:28,309 --> 00:17:32,569
whether you want to get paid or you want

375
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:35,240
to do it on a volunteer basis it's up to

376
00:17:32,569 --> 00:17:38,029
you but call us in contact us that's

377
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:40,309
important isn't it yes oh it's vital I

378
00:17:38,029 --> 00:17:43,309
think especially I know a lot of medical

379
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:45,409
users through the alternative health

380
00:17:43,309 --> 00:17:47,539
center and these are people that

381
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:50,060
basically are either going through

382
00:17:47,539 --> 00:17:52,190
chemotherapy they have AIDS or they have

383
00:17:50,059 --> 00:17:55,480
some disease like multiple sclerosis

384
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:58,580
that causes spasms some of these people

385
00:17:55,480 --> 00:18:00,200
cannot eat because of the effects of

386
00:17:58,579 --> 00:18:02,509
some of the medication they're taking

387
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:04,910
unless they smoke marijuana they're

388
00:18:02,509 --> 00:18:06,650
wasting away and this is one of the

389
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:09,290
specific things that's particularly good

390
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:12,740
for the wasting syndrome and I've known

391
00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:15,349
other people with problems with spasms

392
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:18,769
or phantom pain marijuana is one of the

393
00:18:15,349 --> 00:18:21,649
best things for that and there's no

394
00:18:18,769 --> 00:18:24,740
exemption I wanted to make sure you know

395
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:28,400
in the recrimination bill does not

396
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:30,410
exempt medical users so what what will

397
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:33,170
happen is that people who are in pain

398
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:37,100
people who are in wheelchairs will go to

399
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:41,600
jail this isn't right notice it's wrong

400
00:18:37,099 --> 00:18:43,369
you know imp is useful as a medicine for

401
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:45,259
many different people and to torture

402
00:18:43,369 --> 00:18:47,959
those people by bringing them into the

403
00:18:45,259 --> 00:18:50,240
criminal justice system and persecuting

404
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:52,819
them this this is wrong and that's why

405
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:55,390
we're out here working hard to try to

406
00:18:52,819 --> 00:18:58,490
stop that you know in the legislature

407
00:18:55,390 --> 00:19:03,110
one legislator introduced a bill to

408
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:05,539
amend this to include medical marijuana

409
00:19:03,109 --> 00:19:07,519
as an exemption from the rhee

410
00:19:05,539 --> 00:19:09,049
criminalization of marijuana how was

411
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:10,549
representative Amy wasn't it was

412
00:19:09,049 --> 00:19:12,649
representative Amy from here in

413
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:16,069
southeast portland and in my

414
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:17,840
neighborhood pack and he tried to amend

415
00:19:16,069 --> 00:19:19,879
the bill to include

416
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:23,178
exemption for people with medical need

417
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:24,679
and the opposition said well you know

418
00:19:23,179 --> 00:19:26,960
that's a separate issue we need to

419
00:19:24,679 --> 00:19:29,330
debate medical marijuana if you want to

420
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:31,250
and so actually they stopped the debate

421
00:19:29,329 --> 00:19:33,379
by saying that we have to debate it on

422
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:35,750
medical marijuana but then they never

423
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:37,340
let the bill on medical marijuana get a

424
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:39,470
hearing yeah there was no way to ever

425
00:19:37,339 --> 00:19:42,798
have the debate in fact in one of the

426
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:45,200
committee hearings representative menace

427
00:19:42,798 --> 00:19:47,690
of wood village here in the Portland

428
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:50,360
area promised representative Amy as a

429
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:52,480
way to stop the debate on amending the

430
00:19:50,359 --> 00:19:55,129
bill to include a medical exemption

431
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:58,308
Menace a Portland Police Detective

432
00:19:55,130 --> 00:20:01,490
Sergeant promised Amy that he would

433
00:19:58,308 --> 00:20:03,648
allow the medical marijuana bill to have

434
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:06,649
a hearing in the Judiciary Committee in

435
00:20:03,648 --> 00:20:09,769
the house but then representative Menace

436
00:20:06,648 --> 00:20:11,689
lied and he never allowed that bill to

437
00:20:09,769 --> 00:20:15,980
come up for hearing he just used that as

438
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:18,080
a ploy to stop the debate so it

439
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:20,000
obviously doesn't care what happens to

440
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:22,250
these medical users at all no he's a

441
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,788
police officer and he wanted to expand

442
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:28,250
his power and to help his cronies in the

443
00:20:25,788 --> 00:20:30,890
police department and that was the sole

444
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:33,230
reason for this bill they the governor

445
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:35,240
said as he signed it it has less to do

446
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:37,278
with the possession of marijuana as it

447
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:40,519
does with expanding the police powers of

448
00:20:37,278 --> 00:20:44,690
search and seizure so that's the real

449
00:20:40,519 --> 00:20:46,278
reason they're doing this and we need to

450
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:49,970
send them a message that that isn't

451
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:51,558
going to be tolerated that we Oregon

452
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:54,259
voters aren't going to let that happen

453
00:20:51,558 --> 00:20:56,148
and you can do that by getting this

454
00:20:54,259 --> 00:20:58,460
petition and signing it if you're out in

455
00:20:56,148 --> 00:21:01,219
public and you see someone who is

456
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:03,340
petitioning go up to them get them to

457
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:06,200

458
00:21:03,339 --> 00:21:08,418
looking for work or you know someone

459
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:10,850
who's looking for work urge them to call

460
00:21:08,419 --> 00:21:12,830
us we need to get this petition out

461
00:21:10,849 --> 00:21:17,959
there and we need to do it today the

462
00:21:12,829 --> 00:21:20,808
number is 235 4606 I bet some of you

463
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:26,149
have that number memorized by now but if

464
00:21:20,808 --> 00:21:28,250
you don't it's 235 4606 we need your

465
00:21:26,148 --> 00:21:30,319
help to be able to put this on the

466
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:31,910
ballot and get this issue before the

467
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:35,059
voters and stop the rec room

468
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:36,860
zation of marijuana yes and I was going

469
00:21:35,059 --> 00:21:39,409
to say it is really simple to do this

470
00:21:36,859 --> 00:21:43,189
what you need to do is sign at the

471
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:44,900
bottom it is your petition and then you

472
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:47,660
make sure you have the right County in

473
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:49,580
oh good good point yeah and what you

474
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:51,259
want to do is ask like Donna said are

475
00:21:49,579 --> 00:21:53,419
you registered to vote in Oregon and

476
00:21:51,259 --> 00:21:55,700
they'll answer you and according to

477
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:57,830
their answer you have them sign the

478
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:59,720
right county and that's all you really

479
00:21:57,829 --> 00:22:02,119
got to do is make sure they're doing it

480
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:06,259
right so the Secretary of State will be

481
00:22:02,119 --> 00:22:08,750
happy and that's basically it and you

482
00:22:06,259 --> 00:22:11,089
could have a little chitchat a lot of

483
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:14,779
people do realize the benefits and are

484
00:22:11,089 --> 00:22:16,490
proud to sign this and even many people

485
00:22:14,779 --> 00:22:19,599
who don't use marijuana themselves know

486
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:21,559
others that do use it medicinally or

487
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:23,209
recreationally and don't believe that

488
00:22:21,559 --> 00:22:25,579
those people should go to jail that's

489
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:28,370
what strikes me it gives me really a lot

490
00:22:25,579 --> 00:22:30,679
of hope to know that people realize that

491
00:22:28,369 --> 00:22:32,299
sure they may not want to take it you

492
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:36,670
know i mean i want to take aspirin but

493
00:22:32,299 --> 00:22:36,669
you know i think it should be available

494
00:22:36,849 --> 00:22:41,929
yeah you know here in the portland area

495
00:22:39,079 --> 00:22:43,609
in gathering signatures you often have

496
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:46,160
to have three different counties as the

497
00:22:43,609 --> 00:22:48,979
primary counties you've got Multnomah

498
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:51,980
placa must and Washington counties the

499
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:54,680
tri-county area but outside of this area

500
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:57,049
if you're in Corvallis you've got linen

501
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:58,190
Benton County because the the boundary

502
00:22:57,049 --> 00:22:59,869
of the county is right there on the

503
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:03,289
Willamette River if you're down in

504
00:22:59,869 --> 00:23:05,000
eugene lane county is where you're going

505
00:23:03,289 --> 00:23:07,609
to get most of your signatures but the

506
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:10,700
real key is that the petitions there's a

507
00:23:07,609 --> 00:23:13,459
little box in the upper corner that you

508
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:15,350
need to this blank says county and you

509
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:17,809
write the name of the county that and

510
00:23:15,349 --> 00:23:21,500
then everyone who signs that she needs

511
00:23:17,809 --> 00:23:23,480
to be registered in that county so that

512
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:25,339
they have to be registered to vote in

513
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:27,890
that county or else their signature

514
00:23:25,339 --> 00:23:30,079
doesn't really count we have to get

515
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:32,420
another one to make up for it then when

516
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:34,639
you've got your signatures need to make

517
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:36,980
sure you fill in this box on the bottom

518
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:39,050
it's the circulator statement saying

519
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:40,910
that you circulated this petition and

520
00:23:39,049 --> 00:23:43,200
that you believe the people who signed

521
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:46,350
it or registered voters you put

522
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:48,298
address in there and so that is the the

523
00:23:46,349 --> 00:23:49,918
easy way to do it basically yeah and

524
00:23:48,298 --> 00:23:51,509
I've noticed a lot of people they come

525
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:53,580
up and they're really excited about

526
00:23:51,509 --> 00:23:55,109
signing so their eagerness they just

527
00:23:53,579 --> 00:23:57,269
start writing their name down anywhere

528
00:23:55,109 --> 00:23:59,398
so that's why it's really good just to

529
00:23:57,269 --> 00:24:00,899
be careful what county they're in you

530
00:23:59,398 --> 00:24:02,638
have to make certainly sign the right

531
00:24:00,898 --> 00:24:05,788
counties also if you're registering

532
00:24:02,638 --> 00:24:08,729
voters they can't sign at the same time

533
00:24:05,788 --> 00:24:11,609
that they register it takes time to

534
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:13,528
process their registration and they have

535
00:24:11,609 --> 00:24:16,168
to base usually when i'm at saturday

536
00:24:13,528 --> 00:24:17,909
market when I register voters I tell

537
00:24:16,169 --> 00:24:21,720
them that when their card comes in the

538
00:24:17,909 --> 00:24:24,960
mail come in and sign then now with with

539
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:26,669
people who want to petition lately we've

540
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,399
been paying people to petition of what I

541
00:24:26,669 --> 00:24:30,750
do is I have people go down the county

542
00:24:29,398 --> 00:24:32,489
elections office and actually that's

543
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:36,028
just a little over a mile away from our

544
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:37,649
office in Southeast Portland and you can

545
00:24:36,028 --> 00:24:40,319
go right into the county elections

546
00:24:37,648 --> 00:24:42,569
office in your county here in Portland

547
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:46,138
it's at southeast eleventh and Morrison

548
00:24:42,569 --> 00:24:48,480
but in other cities it's usually

549
00:24:46,138 --> 00:24:50,879
wherever the county governments based

550
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:53,250
out of you go into the elections office

551
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,870
and they will stamp your voter

552
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:58,380
registration card and give you a

553
00:24:54,869 --> 00:25:00,298
certificate right there showing that you

554
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:02,669
are registered to vote from that time

555
00:25:00,298 --> 00:25:04,710
forward then as soon as it gets into

556
00:25:02,669 --> 00:25:06,600
your County Elections Office you can

557
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:09,000
start circulating the petition you can

558
00:25:06,599 --> 00:25:13,138
sign the petition you can get active on

559
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:18,298
a basis that is useful for our political

560
00:25:13,138 --> 00:25:25,439
movement so once again that phone number

561
00:25:18,298 --> 00:25:29,099
is 235 for 606 that's 235 4606 if you're

562
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:33,659
outside of the Portland area add 1503 to

563
00:25:29,099 --> 00:25:36,329
the front 235 4606 and we're real happy

564
00:25:33,659 --> 00:25:40,409
to send out the Oregon cannabis Tax Act

565
00:25:36,329 --> 00:25:45,329
petition to you know there was an

566
00:25:40,409 --> 00:25:46,590
article in The Lancet which came out in

567
00:25:45,329 --> 00:25:50,158
December of nine

568
00:25:46,589 --> 00:25:52,889
95 called the war on drugs of

569
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:55,830
decriminalizing canvas that article the

570
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:59,309
very first sentence of that article said

571
00:25:55,829 --> 00:26:03,538

572
00:25:59,308 --> 00:26:06,149
term is not harmful to health yes votes

573
00:26:03,538 --> 00:26:07,919
now that's this is a peer-reviewed

574
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:09,990
medical journal one of the most widely

575
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:12,480
respected medical journals in the world

576
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:14,849
it's been coming out for 200 years now

577
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,679
it's one of the oldest medical journals

578
00:26:14,849 --> 00:26:19,349
in the world and the oldest one in the

579
00:26:16,679 --> 00:26:21,450
English language and the first sentence

580
00:26:19,349 --> 00:26:25,109

581
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:27,690
head editor was the smoking of cannabis

584
00:26:31,048 --> 00:26:35,359
quote that I just love those quote

585
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:40,890
sooner or later politicians are going to

586
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:44,038
have to stop running scared and address

587
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:47,580
the evidence cannabis per se is not

588
00:26:44,038 --> 00:26:51,298
harmful to health but driving it further

589
00:26:47,579 --> 00:26:53,879
underground may well be in quote here in

590
00:26:51,298 --> 00:26:56,579
Oregon our legislature has taken a move

591
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:59,909
to drive cannabis further underground

592
00:26:56,579 --> 00:27:02,879
and we have a response we have the power

593
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:05,340
of referendum we want not like it's some

594
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:07,289
big lectures that's right right we have

595
00:27:05,339 --> 00:27:10,259
the power of referendum and we need to

596
00:27:07,288 --> 00:27:12,450
get 50,000 registered Oregon voters

597
00:27:10,259 --> 00:27:15,480
signatures to put this on the ballot and

598
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:18,808
we need you to vote no on it same time

599
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:21,480
we need 75,000 registered Oregon voters

600
00:27:18,808 --> 00:27:24,720
to put the regulation and taxation of

601
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:27,120
cannabis and legal medical cannabis and

602
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:29,850
legal industrial hemp on the ballot we

603
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:35,129
can do that but we need your help once

604
00:27:29,849 --> 00:27:36,898

606
00:27:36,898 --> 00:27:43,918

610
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:56,289
adventures and it's exciting it's best

611
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:57,970
way to meet people I know oh yeah I've

612
00:27:56,289 --> 00:28:01,930
actually met some friends through this

613
00:27:57,970 --> 00:28:05,170
and it's it's beneficial not only for

614
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:07,480
oneself but for everybody and I think

615
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:08,830
it's just ideal that if you're stressed

616
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:10,150
out about something like you're afraid

617
00:28:08,829 --> 00:28:12,759
the pleats are going to kick in your

618
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:16,180
door or something then it's better to do

619
00:28:12,759 --> 00:28:19,779
something about it alright not just sit

620
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:23,590
back and watch TV and become a part of

621
00:28:19,779 --> 00:28:25,619
the norm you can if you want to but it's

622
00:28:23,589 --> 00:28:28,869
all about this should be a free country
