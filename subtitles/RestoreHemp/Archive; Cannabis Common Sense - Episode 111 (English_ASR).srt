1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,200
exactly you know this we we've had him

2
00:00:02,279 --> 00:00:06,119
fests in the past but some of the folks

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:08,280
who were organizing it just couldn't do

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,379
it this year but the ones up in Seattle

5
00:00:08,279 --> 00:00:13,768
have traditionally been a lot larger

6
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:16,350
so watch next month and we'll have some

7
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:17,850

doctor tell us why you decided to be a

37
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:42,780
chief petitioner to regulate the sale of

38
00:01:40,228 --> 00:01:45,228
marijuana to adults and allow doctors to

39
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:49,978
prescribe it through pharmacies high

40
00:01:45,228 --> 00:01:52,379
practice medicine and Malala and I found

41
00:01:49,978 --> 00:01:54,179
out either directly or indirectly that

42
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:56,339
many of my patients were not only used

43
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:58,350
in my prescriptions for the control of

44
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:01,109
pain but they were also smoking

45
00:01:58,349 --> 00:02:04,649
marijuana so I did an investigation of

46
00:02:01,109 --> 00:02:07,030
my own and found out that marijuana has

47
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:09,610
been used for thousands of years

48
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:12,729
and very effectively for a whole variety

49
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:15,430

99
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:28,709
there because he's a real colorful

100
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:30,949
character really knowledgeable in his

101
00:04:28,709 --> 00:04:34,258
field of pharmacology and toxicology

102
00:04:30,949 --> 00:04:37,199
talks over my head sometimes and you can

103
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:40,110
meet some dedicated volunteers who've

104
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:43,020
been on the street you know talking with

105
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:44,280
people I'm all time like Floyd Landreth

106
00:04:43,019 --> 00:04:48,029
who's down there used almost every

107
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:51,750
Saturday he sees the direct impact that

108
00:04:48,029 --> 00:04:54,719
our prohibition has on your fellow

109
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:56,639
citizens on your neighbors because he's

110
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,820
out there helping folks who were trapped

111
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:02,360
in that vicious cycle of prohibition so

112
00:04:58,819 --> 00:05:05,879
he does a needle exchanges so the folks

113
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:08,910
who are addicted to hard drugs go to

114
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:10,949
Floyd five days a week and they exchange

115
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:12,870
needles which keeps the neighborhoods

116
00:05:10,949 --> 00:05:16,169
clean at least around there you don't

117
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:17,879
find used needles laying around in the

118
00:05:16,168 --> 00:05:20,038
gutter because the folks can go trade

119
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:22,110
them in for new ones for free so a

120
00:05:20,038 --> 00:05:24,629
really valuable public service Andy

121
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:26,460
gives out free food to folks - yeah so

122
00:05:24,629 --> 00:05:30,029
it's you know it provides a little

123
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:33,859
community for people so yeah there's a

124
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:38,819
story out of a German language paper in

125
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:41,848
out of lexan Berg it's in the Luxembourg

126
00:05:38,819 --> 00:05:45,149
policy they announce a new drug policy

127
00:05:41,848 --> 00:05:46,800
for Luxembourg the these changes were

128
00:05:45,149 --> 00:05:48,569
agreed upon by the main political

129
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:52,800
parties they're the Christian Democrats

130
00:05:48,569 --> 00:05:55,019
and little liberal Democrats and it's

131
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,960
their intention to enshrine a newly

132
00:05:55,019 --> 00:06:01,709
defined health based drug policy into

133
00:05:57,959 --> 00:06:03,418
law current policies won't be changed as

134
00:06:01,709 --> 00:06:05,848
much as extended and strengthened and

135
00:06:03,418 --> 00:06:08,639
made official says hardcore addicts will

136
00:06:05,848 --> 00:06:09,870
be given heroin and put into the

137
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,030
methadone program

138
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:14,098
and the penalties for consumption of

139
00:06:12,029 --> 00:06:16,649
soft drugs another word for marijuana

140
00:06:14,098 --> 00:06:18,839
and hashish will be reduced to a fine

141
00:06:16,649 --> 00:06:21,899
judges will be empowered to reduce the

142
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:24,359
penalties if accompanied by

143
00:06:21,899 --> 00:06:26,819
therapy courses it says of course this

144
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:28,379
is translated from German so it's a

145
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:32,038
little little rough here it says a

146
00:06:28,379 --> 00:06:34,769
little stilted Luxembourg is keeping the

147
00:06:32,038 --> 00:06:37,110
its eyes firmly fixed on quote the

148
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:39,209
limits of the possible there can be no

149
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:42,569
doubt that Prime Minister Jung Kerr

150
00:06:39,209 --> 00:06:44,849
intends to fix the new drug policy in a

151
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:48,990
bill that he hopes to pass in the next

152
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:50,430
five years so they're changing their

153
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:52,918
drug policies and making them more

154
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:56,629
realistic there in Luxembourg Luxembourg

155
00:06:52,918 --> 00:07:00,719
is a tiny country between Germany and

156
00:06:56,629 --> 00:07:03,389
France so are they basing their policies

157
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,430
on Netherlands experiment there or on

158
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:07,288
the Netherlands and Swiss policies it

159
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:09,990
does appear that they're trying to base

160
00:07:07,288 --> 00:07:12,079
their policies there you know France it

161
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:15,629
like the United States is strongly

162
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:17,909
prohibitionists and Germany it has been

163
00:07:15,629 --> 00:07:19,379
strong pretty prohibitions not as strong

164
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:21,660
as the French but has been

165
00:07:19,379 --> 00:07:24,209
prohibitionist but it's become much more

166
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:25,919
open in several states well see that's

167
00:07:24,209 --> 00:07:27,180
the difference I think between France

168
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:29,698
Germany over there

169
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:32,009
France is a very centralized government

170
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:34,650
everything comes out of Paris you know

171
00:07:32,009 --> 00:07:36,719
they localities don't really have much

172
00:07:34,649 --> 00:07:39,810
power while in Germany they have states

173
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,430
like we have here United States and

174
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:43,199
there they have you know quite a bit of

175
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:45,150
power individual states and what they do

176
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:47,400
in different states there have

177
00:07:45,149 --> 00:07:49,310
experimented with different ways of the

178
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:51,779
dealing with soft drugs trying to

179
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:55,050
separate out soft drugs from harder

180
00:07:51,779 --> 00:07:57,259
drugs and then so some of them and they

181
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:59,069
you know when the board is with

182
00:07:57,259 --> 00:08:00,719
Netherlands because they've seen the

183
00:07:59,069 --> 00:08:02,848
impact of Netherlands and so they're

184
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,490
trying to fix it in Germany there and

185
00:08:02,848 --> 00:08:07,769
then some of the former states there and

186
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:09,658
the former East Germany because they've

187
00:08:07,769 --> 00:08:11,098
had a lot of problems there with

188
00:08:09,658 --> 00:08:12,990
unemployment and people turning into

189
00:08:11,098 --> 00:08:15,538
drugs and and people trying to make

190
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:17,009
money off of a prohibition policies and

191
00:08:15,538 --> 00:08:19,860
so there's a lot of different ways

192
00:08:17,009 --> 00:08:21,089
people are doing it and and so it's kind

193
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,620
of interesting to see what happens we

194
00:08:21,089 --> 00:08:25,769
will come out of over there and I'm sure

195
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:27,810
it's it'll give us some lessons here as

196
00:08:25,769 --> 00:08:30,769
we try to figure out what's the best way

197
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:33,179
to go for our drug policy reform

198
00:08:30,769 --> 00:08:36,689
separate out soft drugs from harder

199
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:39,418
drugs and to provide treatment for folks

200
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:43,469
and that's what we want to do is is to

201
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:44,819
take the market for adult marijuana and

202
00:08:43,469 --> 00:08:47,100
take it out of the hands of the black

203
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:49,740
market and put into the state liquor

204
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:51,690
stores where it's strictly regulated the

205
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:54,330
sales are regulated when the age limit

206
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:57,480
of 21 is enforced - that's one thing in

207
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:59,970
the black market you can ask any high

208
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:02,730
school kid what's easier to get beer or

209
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:05,279
marijuana and they're gonna say every

210
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:07,470
time that marijuana is much easier to

211
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:10,409
get than beer and just infinitely easier

212
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:13,649
to get then distilled alcohol yeah so

213
00:09:10,409 --> 00:09:17,789
it's that's what we want to do is to you

214
00:09:13,649 --> 00:09:21,539
know is to bring a realistic policy you

215
00:09:17,789 --> 00:09:23,429
know on marijuana cannabis here in the

216
00:09:21,539 --> 00:09:23,699
state of Oregon that's what we're all

217
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:25,889
about

218
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:29,820
and this is the best way to go about it

219
00:09:25,889 --> 00:09:30,899
and we think it's been it's been looked

220
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,670
at as far as the international treaties

221
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:34,860
and how I'll fit in with that I know we

222
00:09:32,669 --> 00:09:36,719
talk about that on numerous shows so if

223
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:39,600
you're faithful watch every pilot wants

224
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:41,700
to go into it right now but you know

225
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:45,300
it's this is we're trying to do we want

226
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:48,420
to bring change to this and so we have

227
00:09:45,299 --> 00:09:50,399
any more good news or bad news articles

228
00:09:48,419 --> 00:09:54,659
we share with folks well here's one that

229
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:59,549

230

him of any wrongdoing The Village Voice

251

00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,899
the story about the arrest warrant and

253
00:10:55,828 --> 00:10:59,759
CNN later obtained documents related to

254
00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:02,700
the case according to the affidavit

255
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:04,649

tried to flee the residence apparently

262
00:11:17,578 --> 00:11:21,870
this man said he'd received five or six

263
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:23,909
shipments like this and had been paid

264
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:27,269
fifteen hundred dollars for each of the

00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:38,250
through the mail on behalf of her

270
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:39,720
husband's chauffeur she claimed that she

271
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:42,328
did not know the contents of the

272
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:45,209
packages she'd shipped a spokesman for

273
00:11:42,328 --> 00:11:47,578
the u.s. Southern Command told CNN that

274
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:50,039
the husband was investigated after the

275
00:11:47,578 --> 00:11:53,219
incident occurred and has been cleared

276
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:54,750
of any wrongdoing however the army said

277
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:57,690
colonel hight requested and was granted

278
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:59,250
a transfer from Bogota where he was in

279
00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:02,510
charge of the US military group

280
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:05,549
providing assistance to the Colombian

281
00:12:02,509 --> 00:12:08,338
counter-narcotics effort well yeah I'm

282
00:12:05,549 --> 00:12:09,899
sure there that senator he requested a

283
00:12:08,339 --> 00:12:11,670
transfer they probably gave him five

284
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:13,440
seconds request one before they would

285
00:12:11,669 --> 00:12:15,389
you know kick him out of the country

286
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,370
there doesn't look very good when the

287
00:12:15,389 --> 00:12:20,009
you know the head of the anti-drug

288
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:22,310
efforts in Colombia the US head the wife

289
00:12:20,009 --> 00:12:25,289
was you involved in smuggling I mean

290
00:12:22,309 --> 00:12:27,958
either she was knowingly or she is very

291
00:12:25,289 --> 00:12:29,338
very naive naive because I mean they

292
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:32,489
always ask you when you send anything

293
00:12:29,339 --> 00:12:34,649
overseas you have to put on whether from

294
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:37,079
the US or to the US you have to put on a

295
00:12:34,649 --> 00:12:38,429
form what's in the package I mean that's

296
00:12:37,078 --> 00:12:40,078
because the customs you know in each

297
00:12:38,429 --> 00:12:43,289
country they want to know and the other

298
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:44,698
right to know and so in the she claims

299
00:12:43,289 --> 00:12:48,679
she didn't know what I mean how you know

300
00:12:44,698 --> 00:12:51,579
naive could she be it just shows the

301
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:53,769
impossible you know

302
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:56,139
that we're shooting at you know that the

303
00:12:53,769 --> 00:12:57,699
government is financing here we send

304
00:12:56,139 --> 00:12:58,960
these people down there to wipe out

305
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:03,430
drugs and what are they doing

306
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:05,379
whether naively or purposely they're

307
00:13:03,429 --> 00:13:09,339
shipping more cocaine back to the United

308
00:13:05,379 --> 00:13:11,769
States it's just yeah and yeah and in

309
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:13,240
Colombia it's folks been following the

310
00:13:11,769 --> 00:13:16,090
news out of there but it's pretty scary

311
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:17,620
what's coming out you know the US

312
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:19,930
recently lost one of its most

313
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:22,120
sophisticated spying planes down to

314
00:13:19,929 --> 00:13:23,559
Colombia's only there's like seven of

315
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:26,769
these planes that existed in the world

316
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:29,979
and one went down there with a bunch of

317
00:13:26,769 --> 00:13:31,689
us people on board and now Barry

318
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:34,090
McCaffrey has been doing a big tour down

319
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:36,610
there and he's requesting more money be

320
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:37,030
sent down there ungodly sum amounts of

321
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:39,370
money

322
00:13:37,029 --> 00:13:41,169
I think that's our over a billion

323
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:43,629
dollars yeah and that's probably our

324
00:13:41,169 --> 00:13:46,120
next war people are already talking

325
00:13:43,629 --> 00:13:48,610
about you know Vietnam there because the

326
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:50,830
the rebels who are there you know

327
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:52,690
opposing the oiligarchy that controls

328
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:55,930
the country have lined themselves up

329
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:58,300
with the drug rollers and they control I

330
00:13:55,929 --> 00:13:59,589
think almost half the country now and

331
00:13:58,299 --> 00:14:01,089
that's pretty significant you know when

332
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:03,310
we hear much about that here's this

333
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:06,879
rebel force that controls half of one of

334
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:09,189
our allies and us doesn't want to see

335
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:12,100
you know a country taking over by people

336
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:14,500
that don't have problem with people

337
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:16,029
growing drugs it'll be real interesting

338
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:18,009
see what comes out of there

339
00:14:16,029 --> 00:14:19,990
I mean already you know in Afghanistan

340
00:14:18,009 --> 00:14:21,970
where you know people have grown there

341
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:25,180
we've just lobbed over cruise missiles

342
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:26,649
we feel like of the Afghanistan so it

343
00:14:25,179 --> 00:14:27,699
could be it's pretty scary was gonna

344
00:14:26,649 --> 00:14:29,529
have right here know in hemisphere

345
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:31,570
because we still believe the Marone

346
00:14:29,529 --> 00:14:32,649
doctor and our government does yeah that

347
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:36,550
we want to control everything that

348
00:14:32,649 --> 00:14:41,529
happens in this hemisphere so that's

349
00:14:36,549 --> 00:14:45,429
another situation there's an article

350
00:14:41,529 --> 00:14:47,289
from Massachusetts about forfeiture laws

351
00:14:45,429 --> 00:14:49,179
and see how money corrupts law

352
00:14:47,289 --> 00:14:51,250
enforcement to see how money corrupts

353
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:53,409
law enforcement agencies look at the

354
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:55,509
effects of asset forfeiture laws a

355
00:14:53,409 --> 00:14:57,789
police officer can take all the money

356
00:14:55,509 --> 00:14:59,799
you're carrying and the car you're

357
00:14:57,789 --> 00:15:02,649
driving when stopped on the mere

358
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:04,729
suspicion that you are a drug dealer

359
00:15:02,649 --> 00:15:07,549
yet never charge you with

360
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:09,649
and it will take you years and thousands

361
00:15:07,549 --> 00:15:11,779
of dollars to recover your property if

362
00:15:09,649 --> 00:15:13,759
it's even possible to recover it your

363
00:15:11,779 --> 00:15:16,519
car may have been sold already or badly

364
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:18,710
damaged in such forfeiture called civil

365
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:21,350
asset forfeiture because you were never

366
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:23,030
charged with crime you must prove in a

367
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:25,100
court of law that the money and the car

368
00:15:23,029 --> 00:15:27,709
are legally yours and were never

369
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:29,509
involved in some crime in other words

370
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:32,600
you have to prove you were an innocent

371
00:15:29,509 --> 00:15:34,100
party and stupid as it sounds you may

372
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:36,200
have to prove that your property is

373
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:38,750
innocent too the government doesn't have

374
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:40,640
to prove you're guilty of anything while

375
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:42,950
it may be easy to prove you or the legal

376
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:44,629
owner of a car it's far more difficult

377
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:48,259
to prove that the money you're carrying

378
00:15:44,629 --> 00:15:49,789
is money you earn at your job imagine

379
00:15:48,259 --> 00:15:51,830
how hard it would be to prove your car

380
00:15:49,789 --> 00:15:54,289
or money we're never used to facilitate

381
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:56,480
a crime an attorney can cost you

382
00:15:54,289 --> 00:15:58,819
thousands of dollars to sue for recovery

383
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:01,460
of your property legal counsel is not

384
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:04,430
provided in such cases many people in

385
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:06,259
simple in similar situations simply let

386
00:16:04,429 --> 00:16:09,620
go and don't try to recover their

387
00:16:06,259 --> 00:16:12,799
property why spend $6,000 on attorney

388
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:14,720
fees to recover $5,000 just doesn't make

389
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:17,209
sense and that's what they count on it

390
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:20,210
these civil asset forfeiture you know

391
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:23,180
until these laws were passed in the late

392
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:25,100
80s under Ronald Reagan this was never

393
00:16:23,179 --> 00:16:27,349
allowed it was considered

394
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:30,610
unconstitutional for the government to

395
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:32,930
seize and use your property there if

396
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:34,850
it's one of those things that needs to

397
00:16:32,929 --> 00:16:37,519
be reformed isn't it yeah I think so I

398
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:38,659
mean it's not much that needs to be said

399
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:41,809
about that I still think it's

400
00:16:38,659 --> 00:16:44,240
unconstitutional even though maybe have

401
00:16:41,809 --> 00:16:46,279
you know are those nine people sitting

402
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,740
up on a bench in Washington DC haven't

403
00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:51,470
quite seen the way that I think majority

404
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:53,480
of Americans see it but it'll change I

405
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:55,460
mean I mean at one time remember the

406
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:57,409
Supreme Court's I was ok to lock up

407
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:59,720
Japanese citizens just because they were

408
00:16:57,409 --> 00:17:01,129
of Japanese ancestry and living here in

409
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:03,980
u.s. right

410
00:17:01,129 --> 00:17:06,799
so it'll it will change and that's what

411
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:09,890
we have to help facilitate that change

412
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:11,359
have to be able to work to inform people

413
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:14,240
when you're sitting around with your

414
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:15,439
