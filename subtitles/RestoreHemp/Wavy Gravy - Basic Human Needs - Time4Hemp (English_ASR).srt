11
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,199
asking people where it's at and this

12
00:00:23,278 --> 00:00:28,399
song is like if you take

13
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:31,359
uh an arc of lights and you if you put a

14
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:33,519

15
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:36,800
to the mirror the other morning

16
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,879
it's all done with people

17
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:40,799
if you stick a match between two mirrors

18
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:42,320
you get an arc of lights that stretches

19
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:45,599
to infinity

20
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:49,119
and this song is that ark of lights

21
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:52,399
and wouldn't it be neat

22
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:54,238
if the people that you meet had shoes

23
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:58,160
upon their feet

24
00:00:54,238 --> 00:01:02,640
and something to eat and wouldn't it be

25
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:06,719

26
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:09,840
