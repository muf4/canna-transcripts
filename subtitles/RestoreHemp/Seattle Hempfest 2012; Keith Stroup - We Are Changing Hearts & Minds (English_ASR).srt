that it's pulled together by volunteers

21
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:49,718
if people think you can't still do

22
00:00:47,878 --> 00:00:52,599
effective political organizing on the

23
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:53,879
local level I mean this is I think their

24
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,198
budget is something like a half a

25
00:00:53,878 --> 00:00:58,399
million dollar for this event and it is

26
00:00:56,198 --> 00:01:00,599
totally run by volunteers no one gets

27
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:03,198
