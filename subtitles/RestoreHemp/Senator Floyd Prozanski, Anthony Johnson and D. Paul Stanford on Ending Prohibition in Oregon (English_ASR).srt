1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,040
if you think and you look historically

2
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:07,278
marijuana was not prohibited until 37

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,919
and so up until that time you actually

4
00:00:07,278 --> 00:00:12,240
had a legal viable market and just

5
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:14,879
because of market shares and

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,560
say competing market interest

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,320
as it pertains to safe with industrial

8
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:20,000
hemp you had

9
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,560
randolph hearst who wanted to ensure

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,320
that wood fiber became the fiber for

11
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:26,079
paper you had

12
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,199
dupont and other chemical companies who

13
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:29,198
wanted to

14
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,519
see cotton move forward and so they

15
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:34,079
wanted to demonize

16
00:00:31,518 --> 00:00:36,320
marijuana and so and if you look at what

17
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,840
happened with the prohibition of alcohol

18
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:41,600
and you had basically the same setup

19
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,640
it's just taken many more years because

20
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,120
let's say

21
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,280
interference and obstacles that came in

22
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:50,000
place but clearly i think you will in

23
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,320
fact see a change and

24
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,759
a rebirth of an industry and one of the

25
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,000
things that's very important to me is

26
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:58,558
ensuring that local farmers will have

27
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,520
the opportunity to benefit

28
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:02,000
what i

29
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,239
think not only for the hemp

30
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,560
industrial hemp but also in the

31
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,000
marijuana for cannabis that's where we

32
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,159
should allow for the

33
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,438
growing to occur you can see small

34
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:12,719
businesses

35
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:16,079
and it's going to be a birth of an

36
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:19,438
industry that's going to bring

37
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:20,959
a lot of new jobs a lot of new jobs to

38
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:22,719
our communities

39
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:25,280
and you can see what has happened just

40
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:26,879
in colorado and what what we'll be

41
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,960
watching in the next couple of months in

42
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:31,920
washington state to see how that plays

43
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:33,679
out and clearly we're in a position

44
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,799
knowing that we're the grassy capital of

45
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:39,118
the world that we can vote

46
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:42,000
that we will in fact be able to be in

47
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:43,280
the market on a on a national basis and

48
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,719
actually

49
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:48,719
be branded for the product that we have

50
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:50,640
will anything happen to people currently

51
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:52,879
in prison for marijuana related

52
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,118
convictions and what about people being

53
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:57,679
charged at the time of legalization if

54
00:01:55,118 --> 00:01:57,680
it should happen

55
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:03,199
well the way it works is that at the

56
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:05,438
time of the conviction it was against

57
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,600
the law and so those convictions will

58
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:09,919
stand that does not mean

59
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:11,598
that the legislature cannot uh revisit

60
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:14,238
and look at this issue on a let's call

61
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:16,919
it somewhat of a case-by-case basis uh i

62
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:19,280
expect that once uh

63
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:21,679
ip53 whatever the ballot measure number

64
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,318
is passes the legislature will start

65
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:27,120
looking at what is the impact on our

66
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:30,238
prison system uh currently and how does

67
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:33,280
it uh pertain uh to the changes that we

68
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:35,519
made uh i believe it was just in 2013 we

69
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:38,318
did a remodification of

70
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,599
the penalties that a person would face

71
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:41,679
if they had

72
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:44,079
previously as anything over an ounce was

73
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,239
a felony we changed that through the

74
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,719
legislative process to up to four ounces

75
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:51,039
is now a misdemeanor and so i expect

76
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:52,800
that you will see at some point looking

77
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:55,120
at what is the cost drivers for the

78
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,120
prison system as to what we think we

79
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,080
should be modifying if anything at that

80
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,840
point uh there's no guarantee i mean the

81
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:05,840
reality is they were when they were

82
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:08,000
convicted it was in fact a felony and so

83
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,878
just the passage of it will not change

84
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,199
that

85
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:13,199
uh regarding the other part rick

86
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:19,158
sorry

87
00:03:22,158 --> 00:03:25,199
well if they're

88
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:26,559
i guess it's going to be based on when

89
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:28,238
the charging instrument

90
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,199
comes through the reality we're going to

91
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:34,400
have this uh period of time over a year

92
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:36,238
from uh basically 2015 up to 2016 that

93
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,760
you're gonna have the transition i will

94
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,680
expect that you'll what you'll see in

95
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:42,239
many of the district attorney's offices

96
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,319
and in uh that are the only district

97
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,158
attorney's offices do felony work they

98
00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:47,679
will start looking at what the reality

99
00:03:46,158 --> 00:03:50,079
is as to what the people have actually

100
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:52,319
passed and i do believe that you'll see

101
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,959
charging practices change based on the

102
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:55,759
passage of ip53

103
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,039
yeah

104
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:58,719
and i'd like to mention you know under

105
00:03:57,039 --> 00:04:00,000
the letter of the law you know nothing

106
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:01,598
changes

107
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,560
the legislature could very well take

108
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:06,639
that issue up and additionally we've

109
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,680
some we've seen especially in denver and

110
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:12,079
seattle once the law passed we saw

111
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,680
prosecutors like drop a bunch of charges

112
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,680
against people so i think you will see

113
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,160
practically speaking an improvement in

114
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,160
how people are treated um but uh we may

115
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,079
need a legislative fix especially as we

116
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,600
look forward towards how much money

117
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,199
we're spending on these cases locking

118
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,479
these people in prison if somebody

119
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,560
happened to be in prison for four or

120
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:30,478
five ounces you know at their home which

121
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,000
would now be allowed under new approach

122
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:34,240
i think that'd be something that the

123
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,360
legislature even potentially certain

124
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,199
judges

125
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,680
definitely could look at what have we

126
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:41,280
learned from colorado and washington and

127
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,840
what are these two states done

128
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:46,239
especially well or poorly from what

129
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:46,239
you've seen

130
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,240
sure i think that

131
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,560
in washington

132
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,400
the bill is fairly poor it doesn't allow

133
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,800
people to grow their own

134
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:57,758
it does it limits the possession to an

135
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,199
ounce

136
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:02,000
if you have over 28 grams in washington

137
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,919
you're

138
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,360
have a misdemeanor if you have over 40

139
00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:09,359
grams you'll go to jail so this is

140
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,720
dramatically better than that

141
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:15,199
and in colorado they have a particularly

142
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:18,560
onerous system of regulation that

143
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:21,439
requires video cameras on the grow site

144
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,759
from seed to sale with video feed to the

145
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:25,038
state store it's definitely over

146
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:27,120
regulated

147
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:30,719
we've seen prices of seven and eight

148
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:32,879
hundred dollars an ounce in washington

149
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,520
and uh several hundred dollars an ounce

150
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:38,000
in colorado we're not going to wipe out

151
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:39,359
the black market at those prices folks i

152
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,120
think

153
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:46,000
initiative 53 will do that and

154
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:50,280
a 35 an ounce tax is certainly

155
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,279
reasonable and i think it's a lot better
