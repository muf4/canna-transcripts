1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
thank you hemp stock great to be here in

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:06,878
oregon

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,800
you're enjoying this beautiful day today

4
00:00:06,878 --> 00:00:10,799
warm enough for you

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,519
well you better get used to it because

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,120
when i wrote my book 20 years ago hemp

7
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,278
lifeline to the future i said that if

8
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:19,038
they didn't legalize hemp soon and make

9
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:21,519
a situation where we changed our

10
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:23,600
industrial base away from fossil fuels

11
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:25,600
and petrochemicals and taking it out of

12
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,679
the hands of the multi-corporations and

13
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,840
returning it to the hands of the farmers

14
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:32,159
and the workers of this society that we

15
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:33,679
can pretty much count on increased

16
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:37,439
desertification

17
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:38,079
erosion rising tides rising temperatures

18
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:40,479
and

19
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:43,359
and climate change in a way that comes

20
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:45,199
in the term of extreme weather

21
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:46,878
and guess what didn't happen the

22
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,960
government did not step in and do the

23
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:51,119
right thing and guess what has happened

24
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,520
the ocean has risen eight inches since i

25
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:55,839
wrote that book the polar ice taps have

26
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,000
melted away to a large extent more in

27
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,079
the north pole than the south of course

28
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,679
and we also know that the multi-court

29
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,000
national corporations are running things

30
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:06,400
more than ever that monsanto is trying

31
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,799
to dominate the food lines of seeds that

32
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,840
we all need that this generation has

33
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:13,280
gotten from our ancestors and

34
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:15,359
foreign to bring us to this point in

35
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,840
history where we stand today at a

36
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:20,879
pivotal epochal moment

37
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:23,600
the question today is not will cannabis

38
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:26,239
survive because hemp has been around for

39
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:28,959
millions of years it's been side by side

40
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:32,239
with humans for 10 000 years hemp will

41
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:35,599
survive the question is for the human

42
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:38,239
race is the human race smart enough

43
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:41,679
to start to use hemp to make sure that

44
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:44,959
we survive that you survive that your

45
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:47,680
children survive that our economy grows

46
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:50,078
in a way that doesn't require constant

47
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,799
increases in consumerism and constant

48
00:01:50,078 --> 00:01:54,559
destruction of our forests and pollution

49
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,439
of our environment

50
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,118
this is the moment where we stand today

51
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:00,398
and as i'm here

52
00:01:59,118 --> 00:02:02,478
at the uh

53
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,718
at the stage here at hemstock i'm

54
00:02:02,478 --> 00:02:07,280
reminded that the last time i came and

55
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:09,519
stood on the stage i was walking onto

56
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,759
the stage to speak and a good friend of

57
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:14,400
mine was walking off the stage having

58
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:15,759
just spoken and that guy was named jack

59
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,680
herrer

60
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:20,000
and he went down the stage and i saw him

61
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,400
sit down next to a tree and i went on

62
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,080
the stage to speak and it was the last

63
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,080
time i saw jack alive

64
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,800
the spirit of jack herrera is here

65
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:37,439
it's in this land like nowhere else

66
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:39,598
because this is where jack poured it out

67
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:41,919
and you are the people who remember him

68
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:43,919
and who remember the dream

69
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:45,439
when i edited the book the emperor wears

70
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:47,518
no clothes

71
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:48,959
it was a moment where i saw a diamond in

72
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,719
the rough

73
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,080
a book that i thought could change the

74
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:54,719
world

75
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,400
and now today we're in a moment where

76
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:59,759
john mccain

77
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,760
has come out favorable for legalizing

78
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:04,560
marijuana

79
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:09,919
where the tea party candidates led the

80
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,920
charge to get industrial hemp restored

81
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,360
now i'm not saying this because these

82
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,519
are the people that i agree with on a

83
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,080
lot of political things i'm just saying

84
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:20,319
look how far we have come look how far

85
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,719
the information is today

86
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:24,399
from oregon and california we have a big

87
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:26,400
problem on our hands

88
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,319
washington state kicked our ass last

89
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,039
year

90
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:32,798
they legalized marijuana in a way that

91
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:35,519
we don't necessarily like all the

92
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:37,120
details but they did it in a way that

93
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:40,879
does allow for the restoration of

94
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:43,120
industrial hemp colorado likewise the

95
00:03:40,878 --> 00:03:45,199
state of kentucky decriminalized up to

96
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,840
eight ounces of marijuana and his a

97
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:50,318
policy a program in which they have a

98
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,400
statewide commission to investigate how

99
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:55,280
to bring half back there

100
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,959
these are the conservatives we are the

101
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,759
area that's supposed to believe in

102
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:02,239
saving the world we're the the liberal

103
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:04,959
the progressive group why are they

104
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:07,200
getting ahead of us

105
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:10,719
it's because

106
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:14,000
history has taken a step forward

107
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:16,560
it's because when barack obama said to

108
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,079
us we have to force him to do the right

109
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,519
thing

110
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:23,759
that we came back and we have done that

111
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:26,079
the reason that the department of

112
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,080
justice has announced a new policy to

113
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:30,399
reduce the number of people who go to

114
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:32,319
prison on mandatory minimums is not

115
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:33,519
because the prison industrial complex

116
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:36,560
wants it

117
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:37,918
it's because we the people have demanded

118
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,639
it

119
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:42,639
the reason that we have these advances

120
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:45,120
happening and then the department of

121
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:48,319
justice has announced that it's going to

122
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:50,639
respect the marijuana laws in colorado

123
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:53,439
and washington it's not because barack

124
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,280
obama is such a cool guy

125
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:58,560
the reason is because the people of the

126
00:04:55,279 --> 00:05:00,559
united states have moved ahead of our

127
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,959
government

128
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,360
and they're too darn slow

129
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:09,319
at catching up with us and so that's

130
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,319
what we're here to do today

131
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:17,198
hey i'm not trying to steal the fun of

132
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,639
my next speaker a good friend of mine

133
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:21,439
paul stanford

134
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:24,319
but one of the reasons that wild horses

135
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:27,199
cannot keep me from being here today is

136
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:30,399
because i believe that the great state

137
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:34,639
of oregon will legalize marijuana at the

138
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:36,959
next election in 2016

139
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:39,280
and i'm more confident than ever because

140
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:41,359
of what paul is going to tell you about

141
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:44,000
three initiatives that have just gotten

142
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:46,160
approved to be circulated and so if

143
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,800
there's anybody out there who really

144
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:51,199
thinks that you want a future where your

145
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,800
children can grow up an environment that

146
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,720
is not toxic

147
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:58,478
in a world that is not controlled by

148
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:01,600
monsanto and international corporations

149
00:05:58,478 --> 00:06:02,478
you better register you better get your

150
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,560
uh

151
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:06,399
petition and get out and collect the

152
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,839
signatures to put this thing on the

153
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:11,918
ballot because we can't keep waiting

154
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:14,560
go and visit the hemp hut and learn

155
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:18,399
about how important pep is to our

156
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:20,720
ecology to our economy in fact to our

157
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:23,439
future and the future of our children

158
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:27,039
and their children from here out

159
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:29,439
as a child of the baby boomer generation

160
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:32,240
i'm embarrassed at the condition which

161
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:35,759
my generation passed the world onto your

162
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:38,560
generation and so i beg you do not make

163
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:41,600
the same mistake we made do not become

164
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:44,800
complacent do not become self-indulgent

165
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:48,080
it's too important it's too important

166
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:50,478
this is our human race

167
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:53,038
gone that will continue but let's do

168
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:55,599
this right now let's take that hem plan

169
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:58,318
