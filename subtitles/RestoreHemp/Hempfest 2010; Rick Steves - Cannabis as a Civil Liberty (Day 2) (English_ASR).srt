1
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,320
it's great to be here i've been in a lot

2
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,799
of places but i can't think of a better

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:17,199
place than right here seattle hymn fest

4
00:00:14,798 --> 00:00:17,199
beautiful

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,880
all right well as vivian said

6
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:27,118
i'm a travel writer

7
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:29,198
and for me high is a place

8
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:32,159
it's a good place it's a sweet place

9
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:33,520
it's a sweet place where my speakers

10
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,199
sound better

11
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,640
suddenly i'm a good cook for

12
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,800
conversations

13
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:43,280
are like stray cats

14
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:45,280
it's a place sometimes i want to visit

15
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,719
a lot of people want to go there

16
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,879
but you know

17
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:52,239
our government says we can't go there

18
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:54,159
why today there's 80 000 americans doing

19
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:56,718
time in prison because they wanted to go

20
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:58,558
to that place called high

21
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:01,039
now there are

22
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:03,519
times when our government can say we

23
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:05,359
can't go there and that's that's right

24
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,680
but if our government says we can't go

25
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:10,560
to a place there better be a good reason

26
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:14,479
we can't go there and there's no reason

27
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,600
we can't go too high

28
00:01:14,478 --> 00:01:18,239
i believe

29
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:21,599
that the responsible adult

30
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:24,719
recreational use of marijuana is a civil

31
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:24,719
liberty yeah

32
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,240
no apologies necessary it's just having

33
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:32,158
fun

34
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:33,759
it's a civil liberty

35
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,359
now it's a drug

36
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,879
and i don't want to promote it we don't

37
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:39,359
need to promote it we're trying to

38
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:40,879
change the law that says people who want

39
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:42,078
to enjoy it

40
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:43,759
can do it

41
00:01:42,078 --> 00:01:44,959
we need to acknowledge that it's not

42
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,840
healthy

43
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:49,280
it can mess you up it can be abused it

44
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,680
can be addictive

45
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:54,159
it's not for children

46
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,320
if you drive intoxicated by anything

47
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,640
they should throw the book at you yeah

48
00:01:56,319 --> 00:02:00,798
if we want to get it anywhere we need to

49
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,040
acknowledge that

50
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:06,960
our government is fighting a war against

51
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:10,399
marijuana it's a perpetual expensive

52
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:12,959
losing battle based on lies it's costing

53
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:15,680
our society billions of dollars of years

54
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:18,719
it's locking up hundreds of thousands of

55
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,879
people every year 800 000 americans get

56
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:23,199
arrested for marijuana and then they've

57
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:24,639
got a record what i bring to the

58
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:27,119
equation

59
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:28,958
is a european perspective i've spent a

60
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,759
third of my adult life in europe and in

61
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:31,680
europe

62
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:36,000
a joint's about as exciting as a can of

63
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:38,239
beer it's just no big deal

64
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,159
now we have a drug abuse problem in our

65
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,840
country and europe has a drug abuse

66
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:43,919
problem in their country we can learn

67
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:47,200
from each other and we can do a better

68
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:49,119
job minimizing the harm that drug abuse

69
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:50,479
causes our society

70
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,800
in europe they've learned that if you

71
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:55,439
have a drug abuse or a drug policy it

72
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,599
should be motivated and assessed not by

73
00:02:55,439 --> 00:03:00,318
how many people do you lock up

74
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:03,679
but by how does it reduce harm to your

75
00:03:00,318 --> 00:03:05,839
society yeah harm reduction and in

76
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,560
europe they're into pragmatic harm

77
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:11,439
reduction and what they found is that if

78
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,519
you take the crime out of the equation

79
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:16,000
you can treat drug abuse as a health

80
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:18,480
problem and an education challenge and

81
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,000
you can help your society minimize the

82
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:23,598
harm that drug abuse causes

83
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,759
now the united states is really into

84
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:27,359
moral into legislating morality and

85
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:29,039
europe has learned that that does not

86
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,640
work it's futile

87
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:32,798
my european friends tell me that a

88
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:35,039
society has to make a choice

89
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:37,680
you can tolerate alternative lifestyles

90
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:39,439
or you can build more prisons

91
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,560
in the united states we're building more

92
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:42,479
prisons

93
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,318
and in europe they've learned

94
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:46,000
that you can you can tolerate

95
00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:47,679
alternative lifestyles and the result is

96
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,680
we've got more people in prison than any

97
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:52,000
civilized country in the world

98
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,400
we lock up eight times as many people

99
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,120
per capita as europeans do

100
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,799
either we are inherently more criminal

101
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,759
or there's something messed up with our

102
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,680
lives

103
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:03,518
and today we can sort that out and we

104
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,920
can explain that to our society in

105
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,959
general now what shapes american drug

106
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:08,878
policy

107
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:11,519
fear it's all about fear it's reaper

108
00:04:08,878 --> 00:04:13,438
madness generations of lies and fear

109
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,680
we've got to take the scariness out of

110
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:17,439
it frankly this group here is kind of

111
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,560
scary to people who are most afraid of

112
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:20,000
drugs

113
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,399
you're not going to solve the problem by

114
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
being more scary in their face

115
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:26,879
you're going to solve the problem by

116
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,439
explaining things to them in a way that

117
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:31,360
lets them not be afraid if we want to

118
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:34,160
get anywhere in this struggle we've got

119
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,319
to stop being scary and being reasonable

120
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,160
and let people know that there's not a

121
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:39,839
whole reservoir of people wishing they

122
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,880
could just ruin their lives with drugs

123
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:44,799
if only it was legal a lot of people out

124
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:46,639
there

125
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,160
think that if marijuana was legal

126
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,079
everybody would smoke it but i'll tell

127
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,960
you in portugal they legalized the

128
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:54,240
consumption of all drugs 10 years ago

129
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,279
and what's happened

130
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,360
nothing

131
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:59,119
it doesn't go up use doesn't go up

132
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,199
anybody who wants to smoke pot is

133
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,360
already smoking pot they just take the

134
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:06,240
crime out of the equation that's a

135
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,240
beautiful thing

136
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:12,079
a lot of americans who are afraid of

137
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,439
marijuana say it's a gateway drug

138
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:16,079
well in the netherlands they've not

139
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:17,680
locked up a pot smoker for 25 years

140
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:19,839
they've got a track record they care

141
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,840
about drug abuse just as much as we do

142
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:23,839
and they liked their system they took

143
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:25,038
the crime out of it and what they

144
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:28,319
realized is

145
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:32,159
their hard drug taking population is not

146
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:33,759
getting bigger it's getting older

147
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,919
young people can experiment with

148
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:38,800
marijuana and not be buying it from

149
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:40,478
criminals on the streets i'll tell you

150
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,038
if there's anything gateway about

151
00:05:40,478 --> 00:05:44,959
marijuana it's illegality

152
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:46,800
because when it's illegal you can only

153
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:49,038
buy it from criminals on the streets and

154
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,360
they've got a vested interest in getting

155
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:53,439
you enough more expensive more addictive

156
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,080
and more profitable drugs if you don't

157
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:58,800
want marijuana to be a gateway drug then

158
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:58,800
legalize it

159
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,600
now this hymn fest is a lot of fun it's

160
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,120
a great celebration of the cannabis

161
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,199
culture but if we're going to legalize

162
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,478
marijuana we've got to get serious and

163
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,560
mobilize

164
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:12,000
i mean we're all understanding this

165
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,478
we're all hip to the fact that there's

166
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,120
nothing dangerous about the mature adult

167
00:06:14,478 --> 00:06:19,519
responsible use of marijuana but our

168
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,038
government needs to understand that and

169
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:23,680
the best way to help our government

170
00:06:21,038 --> 00:06:26,000
understand that is to support advocacy

171
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,680
groups that are fighting your battle and

172
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,120
my battle in the state house and in

173
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,840
washington dc

174
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:34,000
they are waging dogged struggles on

175
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:36,079
small budgets and if you're not

176
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,759
supporting them with a few books you're

177
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:39,439
not helping out

178
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,360
i'm a board member of normal i've been a

179
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:43,038
board member of normal for 10 years i've

180
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,919
got great respect for the work that

181
00:06:43,038 --> 00:06:48,318
they're doing they need your help

182
00:06:45,918 --> 00:06:50,799
these advocacy groups are not charities

183
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,000
they are services and they're doing our

184
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,840
hard work

185
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,439
now we're at a crossroads today we're at

186
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:57,599
an exciting crosswords where we can

187
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:59,759
actually make some difference

188
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:01,120
like prohibition in the 1930s imagine

189
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,199
what it was like in america when they

190
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,879
realized hey that drew that the laws

191
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:07,759
against alcohol are causing more

192
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:09,839
problems than the alcohol itself

193
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:12,479
courageous people stood up and explained

194
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:15,279
that to scared people and they realized

195
00:07:12,478 --> 00:07:17,120
it's stupid to criminalize alcohol

196
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:18,879
in the 30s when they dropped prohibition

197
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,199
they didn't say booze is good they said

198
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:23,199
the laws against booze are causing more

199
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:26,000
problems than the booze itself

200
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:29,360
we're there today with marijuana okay we

201
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,199
can do that but we've got to communicate

202
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,360
mayor laguardia in new york city back in

203
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:35,038
the 1930s said that if you've got a law

204
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,360
on the books that you don't intend to

205
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:40,000
enforce consistently across the board

206
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,879
the very existence of that law erodes

207
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,199
respect for law enforcement in general

208
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:46,800
it demoralizes your police force right

209
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,960
now we got along the books that there's

210
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,280
no serious intent to enforce across the

211
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:53,198
board

212
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:55,679
if they arrested everybody here tomorrow

213
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:57,280
in seattle this city would be one much

214
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,360
less interesting place to call home

215
00:07:57,279 --> 00:08:01,758
wouldn't it

216
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:05,199
i'm telling you i'm a hard-working

217
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:07,919
kid-raising church-going tax-paying

218
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:09,680
american citizen and when i work all day

219
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:12,000
and i want to go home and relax with a

220
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,120
little bit of marijuana that's my civil

221
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,680
liberty

222
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,759
is that right

223
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,079
it's not about hard-on drugs or

224
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,759
self-control i'm just proposing that we

225
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:24,560
learn a little bit from europe about

226
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:27,840
pragmatic harm reduction take the crime

227
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:30,079
out of the equation recognize marijuana

228
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:32,319
the responsible adult

229
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:35,360
recreational use of marijuana as a civil

230
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:38,719
liberty and then we can be smart on

231
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,719
drugs does that make sense

232
00:08:39,038 --> 00:08:43,838
i hope so hey nice to see you all have a

233
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:48,120
great time and happy travels even if

234
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:48,120
you're just staying home all right
