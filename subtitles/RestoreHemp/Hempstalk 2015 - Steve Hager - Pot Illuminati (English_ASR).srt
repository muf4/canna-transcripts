religions came from Cannabis and somehow

17
00:00:43,878 --> 00:00:46,960

19
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:52,759

the magic of the evil Illuminati and

33
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:36,759
we're bending it to our will and we just

34
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:38,520
established a a chapter here in Portland

35

Portland chapter of Po Illuminati this

37
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:46,118
