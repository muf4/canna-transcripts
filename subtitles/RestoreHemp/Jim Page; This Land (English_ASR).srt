this is W he Go's 100th birthday this

2
00:00:03,278 --> 00:00:07,559

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,800
about that is he basically defined the

4
00:00:07,559 --> 00:00:12,558
art of The Ballad The Ballad when it

5
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:15,080
refers to the ballad when it comes from

6
00:00:12,558 --> 00:00:15,910
um the concrete situational life that

7
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,719

9
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:24,479
in so he was a pretty important

10
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:27,479
character in our um

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,480
alternative

12
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:34,200
culture so I took um I took his most

13
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:36,920
famous song which is this land is your

14
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:39,920
land and I rewrote it and it goes like

15
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,920

know you think you've heard someone sing

19
00:01:05,478 --> 00:01:10,879
it before me but it's an old song I had

20
00:01:09,478 --> 00:01:14,879
to change

21
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:18,798
it times ain't what they used to be as I

22
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:23,000
went walking a super highway below the

00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:25,520
gray ha and so did Skyway I was arrested

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,280

00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:38,960
could be a rich land but it's a poor

28
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:41,720
land cuz of the few that hold it in

29
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:46,039
their tight grip hand so that it don't

30
00:01:41,719 --> 00:01:49,000
belong to you me when I was younger and

31
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:50,560
in my schooling I learned and followed

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,478
by all the

33
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,118
rulings I never dreamed that they were

34
00:01:53,478 --> 00:01:58,959
only

35
00:01:55,118 --> 00:02:02,599
foing How Could my teachers lie to me

36
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:06,199
but as time passed and I Grew Older and

37
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:09,199
the world around me got a little colder

38
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:12,439
well then a voice Came Calling at my

39
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:16,280
shoulder said it don't belong to your

40
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:19,519

land could be a rich land but it's a

42
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:25,680
poor land cuz of the few that hold it in

43
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:29,590
that tight grip hand so that it don't

44

on TV when they can reduce you you're

61
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:36,000
just a number when they can knock you

62
00:03:33,158 --> 00:03:38,560
down and they can plow you under and

63
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,318
then the only thing that matters is the

64
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:45,560
dollar then you know it don't belong to

that tight grip hand so that it don't

69
00:03:54,719 --> 00:04:00,598
belong to you or me there was a time

70
00:03:58,039 --> 00:04:04,438
when the song was greater

71
00:04:00,598 --> 00:04:07,078
but that was then and this is later and

72
00:04:04,438 --> 00:04:09,400
there's a hole in my heart just like a

73
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:13,239
crater and they say it's going to be the

74
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:16,160
death of me so let's take this song back
