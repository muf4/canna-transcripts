00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:38,289
a it's a very explosive ballot title it

45
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:40,659
tells you everything that our measure

46
00:02:38,289 --> 00:02:42,189
will do and in a fairly good way I think

47
00:02:40,659 --> 00:02:44,259
I mean the the wording is kind of

48
00:02:42,189 --> 00:02:46,539
stilted of course but it's it's a quite

49
00:02:44,259 --> 00:02:48,699
good doubt measure Paul I think so you

50
00:02:46,539 --> 00:02:50,650
know it was actually drafted by the

51
00:02:48,699 --> 00:02:52,780
secretary of state an attorney general's

52
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:55,000
office and they went through a process

53
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:56,979
where it actually went before the state

54
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,539
Supreme Court because of an error that

55
00:02:56,979 --> 00:03:00,009
was made in the attorney general's

56
00:02:58,539 --> 00:03:01,780
office they said it would have been the

57
00:03:00,009 --> 00:03:03,729
Constitution well in fact it's not a

58
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:06,310
constitutional amendment at all

59
00:03:03,729 --> 00:03:07,810
statutory measure cuz that and went

60
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:08,979
through the Supreme Court very quickly

61
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:11,199
it went through in just three weeks

62
00:03:08,979 --> 00:03:13,929
which I think's a record for Supreme

63
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:17,649
Court acting on something in a quick

64
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:19,420
manner but we've we've got it out we're

the referendum that was Pat or that

121
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:47,670
through their friend but the

122
00:05:45,379 --> 00:05:49,769
realizations of small amounts of

123
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:51,660
cannabis that was passed by state

124
00:05:49,769 --> 00:05:52,549
legislature here and signed by Governor

125
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:54,570
Kitzhaber

126
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:56,250
part of that is it's going to allow them

127
00:05:54,569 --> 00:05:58,050
to take away people's automobiles and

128
00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:00,810
cars for very small amounts of marijuana

129
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:03,389
yeah that's just what the governor said

130
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:06,449
when he signed it he said quote this has

131
00:06:03,389 --> 00:06:10,139
less to do with marijuana as it does

132
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:12,779
with increasing police powers of search

133
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:15,000
and seizure end quote so the governor

134
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:17,879
spelled it out it's not about drugs it's

135
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,120
about money and search and seizure they

136
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:23,100
want to come in and if you've got any

137
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:26,160
marijuana at all they want to be able to

138
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:28,379
search your car search your house seize

139
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:32,850
your property and put you in their

140
00:06:28,379 --> 00:06:35,129
system it would also that bill would

141
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:37,050
also require the suspension of your

142
00:06:35,129 --> 00:06:39,029
driver's license you could be in your

143
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:39,439
bedroom you might not be under the

144
00:06:39,029 --> 00:06:41,629
influence

145
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:43,069
to cannabis they might find it in your

146
00:06:41,629 --> 00:06:45,290
sock when you're in the woods out

147
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:47,750
camping or something whatever they do

148
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:50,330
they can suspend your driver's license

149
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:52,579
and they can take your property and they

150
00:06:50,329 --> 00:06:54,949
can put you in their system where you've

151
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:57,529
got to go through drug treatment and so

152
00:06:54,949 --> 00:07:00,560
it's it's you know the kind of the sad

153
00:06:57,529 --> 00:07:01,879
case or perfect example of this is you

154
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,649
know one of Portland's you know a

155
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:05,540
basketball player I guess an export

156
00:07:03,649 --> 00:07:08,149
investment player now you know cliff

157
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:10,730
Robinson was driving down town in a

158
00:07:08,149 --> 00:07:12,439
Humvee you know a very expensive vehicle

159
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:14,390
and the police pulled him over and they

160
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:16,790
found you know a gram or two of

161
00:07:14,389 --> 00:07:18,680
marijuana and if this were pulled over

162
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:20,510
you know afros law went into effect if

163
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:23,600
it does go into effect they could have

164
00:07:20,509 --> 00:07:25,579
seized his Humvee for like you know $1

165
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:27,260
worth of less of marijuana I mean how

166
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:29,240
much more ridiculous you know do you

167
00:07:27,259 --> 00:07:31,909
want to be but that's what actually

168
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:34,100
happens out there all time yeah and less

169
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:35,390
than a year ago they arrested another

170
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:38,390
Portland trailblazer

171
00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:42,560
Isaiah rider with just under a gram of

172
00:07:38,389 --> 00:07:43,490
marijuana and he went to court and they

173
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:48,319
found him guilty

174
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:50,300
under the current law and if it had been

175
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:52,459
the new law they could have ceased some

176
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:54,590
of his assets and his belongings well he

177
00:07:52,459 --> 00:07:57,319
was in a car I mean yeah I think he was

178
00:07:54,589 --> 00:07:59,418
in you know a BMW or some fancy luxury

179
00:07:57,319 --> 00:08:01,969
car they could have seized I mean the

180
00:07:59,418 --> 00:08:04,189
police are famous for that you know at

181
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:07,760
the recent recent Portland um Hempfest

182
00:08:04,189 --> 00:08:09,469
in downtown waterfront park when we

183
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:11,990
digressed here folks I want to thank

184
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:13,910
Jeff and Susie Crawford for Bohemia

185
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:16,519
after dark for putting on the great

186
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:18,770
Portland Hempfest it was a good success

187
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:20,990
with all types of music and lots of

188
00:08:18,769 --> 00:08:23,479
signatures gathered but down there the

189
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:26,180
police had a what they called on the

190
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:28,400
side of it was a mobile command unit it

191
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:30,470
was basically a Winnebago and I'm sure

192
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:33,049
it was a cease when Omega they had and

193
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:35,538
they now chocolate full of police

194
00:08:33,049 --> 00:08:37,338
equipment you know a mobile booking lab

195
00:08:35,538 --> 00:08:40,129
and all that sort of stuff but something

196
00:08:37,339 --> 00:08:42,200
they obviously seized from normally a

197
00:08:40,129 --> 00:08:44,809
law-abiding citizen and just shows you

198
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:48,800
that you know the what's the what's the

199
00:08:44,809 --> 00:08:50,209
term the police industrial complex what

200
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:52,639
lengths have gone to to keep themselves

201
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:55,100
employed yeah you

202
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:57,740
for a long long time it was illegal for

203
00:08:55,100 --> 00:09:00,290
them to seize property but with the war

204
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:02,299
on drugs back during the Reagan

205
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:05,209
administration suddenly would they allow

206
00:09:02,299 --> 00:09:07,339
property forfeitures even though to me

207
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:10,009
that seems to be a bill of attainder in

208
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:11,930
the US Constitution prohibits bills of

209
00:09:10,009 --> 00:09:14,419
attainder but they went ahead and passed

210
00:09:11,929 --> 00:09:16,519
it and declared it's constitutional so

211
00:09:14,419 --> 00:09:18,019
they're allowing police agencies to

212
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:19,730
seize people's property and

213
00:09:18,019 --> 00:09:21,319
unfortunately that's become a primary

214
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:23,539
motivation for him don't you think oh

215
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:24,500
very much so these days you know the

216
00:09:23,539 --> 00:09:26,750
marijuana

217
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:28,490
task force here in the Portland area you

218
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:30,559
know they've been quoted in the local

219
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:32,779
media mainstream media saying yeah

220
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:35,599
they'd like to bust marijuana growers

221
00:09:32,779 --> 00:09:37,759
because it's a nice easy thing you know

222
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:40,100
they're real o'clock were to let them in

223
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:43,460
and they have lots of lots of things for

224
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:45,050
them to take stereos cars houses you

225
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:47,150
name it they take it in there you know

226
00:09:45,049 --> 00:09:48,679
and they're they're happy to take this

227
00:09:47,149 --> 00:09:51,529
stuff I mean if you don't have a house

228
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:54,199
that they can you know try and forfeit

229
00:09:51,529 --> 00:09:55,189
they'll take your stereo and TV if you

230
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,780
have a house or that you get they can

231
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:59,240
forfeit to leave behind your stereo and

232
00:09:56,779 --> 00:10:00,799
TV so tell me it's not obvious what

233
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,120
they're actually there for yeah they're

234
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:04,309
there to make money

235
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:05,690
done to seize our property it doesn't

236
00:10:04,309 --> 00:10:07,579
have anything to do with drugs and

237
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:09,920
unfortunately too often when they seize

238
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:12,740
drugs those drugs are back on the market

239
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:15,409
the next day folks I mean those guys are

240
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:17,570
out there selling marijuana I've gone in

241
00:10:15,409 --> 00:10:20,779
as an expert witness on a marijuana case

242
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:23,390
once and they showed the the pictures of

243
00:10:20,779 --> 00:10:25,819
someone's garden that they had seized

244
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:27,980
with all these marijuana flowers but

245
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:30,680
when you looked at the actual plants all

246
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:32,210
of the flower tops were snipped off the

247
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:34,759
reason for this is that the police

248
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:36,320
agents snip those off and put them out

249
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:37,490
on the market where they can make a

250
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,290
pretty penny

251
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:42,350
you know marijuana today is more

252
00:10:39,289 --> 00:10:44,509
expensive than gold its $400 an ounce

253
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:47,000
yeah that's more expensive than gold

254
00:10:44,509 --> 00:10:48,919
folks it doesn't doesn't make sense I

255
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,269
mean marijuana grows in the ground it's

256
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:52,429
a crop grows on trees

257
00:10:50,269 --> 00:10:54,199
yeah maybe deep foot torture yes you

258
00:10:52,429 --> 00:10:55,370
know you can you know and it grows in a

259
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,230
very few months I mean why should

260
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:58,909
something like that be more expensive

261
00:10:57,230 --> 00:11:01,370
than gold which you have to dig out of

262
00:10:58,909 --> 00:11:03,679
the ground deep in the ground a lot of

263
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:04,860
times and destroy the environment very

264
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:06,120
Xperia

265
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:07,919
very labor-intensive very

266
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:10,590
capital-intensive thing and why

267
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:13,019
marijuana a simple little plants are

268
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:15,960
more expensive it doesn't make any sense

269
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:18,779
unless you stop to look at the military

270
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:20,910
police industrial complex that makes

271
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:23,129
money out of this they want to put

272
00:11:20,909 --> 00:11:25,980
people in jail and they want to grab a

273
00:11:23,129 --> 00:11:28,980
larger and larger part of the economic

274
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:31,320
pie and they do that by creating these

275
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:34,170
laws you know if you look at the drug

276
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:37,170
laws in general each year here in the

277
00:11:34,169 --> 00:11:39,569
United States they arrest over a million

278
00:11:37,169 --> 00:11:41,129
people I think on drug laws here in the

279
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:43,470
United States we have more people in

280
00:11:41,129 --> 00:11:45,149
prison than any other country in the

281
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:47,910
history of the world we passed the

282
00:11:45,149 --> 00:11:51,149
Soviet Union in South Africa back about

283
00:11:47,909 --> 00:11:54,329
five years ago we have more people in

284
00:11:51,149 --> 00:11:57,509
prison than any other country then the

285
00:11:54,330 --> 00:12:01,170
Chinese do per capita our country is the

286
00:11:57,509 --> 00:12:02,490
world's biggest police state and you

287
00:12:01,169 --> 00:12:05,219
know that's frightening when I was a

288
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:07,470
little kid I grew up in in Texas when I

289
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:10,170
was young and I remember in our schools

290
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:12,899
in Texas they told us that in the Soviet

291
00:12:10,169 --> 00:12:15,120
Union those dirty communists send police

292
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:17,459
officers into the classroom to

293
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,889
intimidate children to turn in their

294
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:22,139
parents well you know they don't do that

295
00:12:19,889 --> 00:12:24,240
in the Soviet Union anymore I mean if

296
00:12:22,139 --> 00:12:26,220
there's not even a Soviet Union anymore

297
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,620
there's communism is not there anymore

298
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:31,019
but we have here in the United States

299
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:34,049
something that's much more insidious and

300
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:37,740
worse we send police officers under the

301
00:12:34,049 --> 00:12:40,949
DARE program in to intimidate children

302
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:43,860
into turning in their parents and

303
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:46,230
turning in their family and friends for

304
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:48,240
minor marijuana crimes if you look at

305
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:50,700
the overall number of people that are

306
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:53,490
arrested 60% of all drug arrests are for

307
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:55,710
marijuana and so if you take those out

308
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:58,019
you're left with a very small number of

309
00:12:55,710 --> 00:13:00,810
people to deal with when marijuana is

310
00:12:58,019 --> 00:13:03,299
legal the rest of the drug problem is

311
00:13:00,809 --> 00:13:04,919
going to be fairly insignificant yeah

312
00:13:03,299 --> 00:13:06,689
it's you know it's it's just really

313
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:08,849
quite frightening the amount of people

314
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:10,440
we have in prisons these days because

315
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:12,659
you look at other industrialized

316
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:15,910
countries around the world that you know

317
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:18,759
studies show all statistics

318
00:13:15,909 --> 00:13:21,509
that we're we have less crime in United

319
00:13:18,759 --> 00:13:24,490
States than the common market countries

320
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:26,919
have you know that we're we have less

321
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:28,750
crime here but yet we lock people up

322
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:30,759
with a higher rate and why is that

323
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:33,190
because you know because we're locking

324
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:34,990
people up for for non for victimless

325
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:37,720
crimes I meant to say that we have less

326
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:39,220
victim crimes here in the United States

327
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:41,259
than they do in other countries other

328
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:42,460
developed countries and what we still

329
00:13:41,259 --> 00:13:43,899
have we have much higher rate of

330
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:45,430
incarceration that's because the

331
00:13:43,899 --> 00:13:48,699
victimless crimes

332
00:13:45,429 --> 00:13:51,009
we got people locked up and now yes it's

333
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:53,920
a horrible vicious circle because down

334
00:13:51,009 --> 00:13:57,189
in California the largest Union now is a

335
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:59,019
prison guard Union which is really scary

336
00:13:57,190 --> 00:14:01,060
because they're the most powerful Union

337
00:13:59,019 --> 00:14:04,269
now and they donate a lot of money every

338
00:14:01,059 --> 00:14:05,409
election campaign and so they worked at

339
00:14:04,269 --> 00:14:08,529
what do they what do they want their

340
00:14:05,409 --> 00:14:10,000
letters to do build more prisons and you

341
00:14:08,529 --> 00:14:12,399
know a state can't afford to have an

342
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,529
empty prison how would that look so they

343
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:16,480
just called an arrest more people

344
00:14:13,529 --> 00:14:18,850
exactly you know in California and now

345
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:21,490
in Oregon the state is spending more

346
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:22,509
money on prisons and jails and

347
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:24,370
incarceration

348
00:14:22,509 --> 00:14:27,309
than they're spending on education

349
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:29,080
that's fright at college education

350
00:14:27,309 --> 00:14:30,879
they're more they're spending more money

351
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:32,110
on keeping people incarcerated than

352
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:37,019
they're spending on community colleges

353
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:39,220
and universities and they're it's just a

354
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:40,720
misappropriation of resources and

355
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:43,090
they're doing that primarily by

356
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:45,100
prohibiting him and you know what we

357
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:47,200
have the answer we have the Oregon

358
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:49,930
cannabis Tax Act this is going to

359
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:52,330
legalize the sales of marijuana it's

360
00:14:49,929 --> 00:14:54,909
going to regulate the sales not just

361
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:56,820
legalize it but regulate it currently

362
00:14:54,909 --> 00:14:58,809
the government has abdicated

363
00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:01,470
responsibility the government has a

364
00:14:58,809 --> 00:15:03,459
responsibility to regulate this market

365
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:05,740
currently it's abdicated that

366
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:08,379
responsibility to the black market and

367
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:10,330
those least able to control it under the

368
00:15:08,379 --> 00:15:12,700
Oregon cannabis Tax Act the government

369
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:15,910
will come in and control them the sales

370
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:18,250
of the drug marijuana it will tax it

371
00:15:15,909 --> 00:15:20,799
will license farmers to produce the drug

372
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:23,139
tax the recreational sales through

373
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:25,479
liquor stores and bars and taverns and

374
00:15:23,139 --> 00:15:27,939
it will allow the untie

375
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:30,699
next sale of marijuana to medical

376
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:32,980
patients in pharmacies and on top of

377
00:15:30,698 --> 00:15:36,269
that it will allow industrial hemp Oh

378
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:39,639
add to be grown without any regulation

379
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:42,879
industrial hemp can be used to produce

380
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:45,159
more paper more fabric more protein and

381
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:46,899
more oil than any other plant on the

382

planet we need your help

383

you know we need to help to restore hemp

396
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:33,339
to its rightful place as a as a medicine

397
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:36,190
as a industrial product that you know

398
00:16:33,339 --> 00:16:38,610
we've used for thousands of years as a

399
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:42,279
pleasure substance that people can use

400
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:44,860
responsibly that's what this is about is

401
00:16:42,278 --> 00:16:45,958
about you know making choices would

402
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:48,190
having the ability to make the choice

403
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:51,039
the government wants to you know take

404
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:53,440
away that choice for us and for why for

405
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:56,439
what reason they just want to have this

406
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:58,660
prohibition machine out there control

407
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:00,519
things you know whether it's the prisons

408
00:16:58,659 --> 00:17:03,698
the police whatever they're just trying

409
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:06,130
to control us all and our initiative

410
00:17:03,698 --> 00:17:09,220
octa the Oregon campaign Oregon canvass

411
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:12,130
Tax Act is about restoring our civil

412
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:15,338
liberties restoring our freedoms yeah

413
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:17,260
you know our initiative will create

414
00:17:15,338 --> 00:17:20,500
thousands of ecologically sustainable

415
00:17:17,259 --> 00:17:23,349
jobs by allowing industrial hemp to be

416
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:25,869
cultivated it'll allow patients to have

417
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:27,698
access to marijuana at cost

418
00:17:25,869 --> 00:17:29,439
currently we were saying just a moment

419
00:17:27,699 --> 00:17:32,169
ago it's four hundred dollars an ounce

420
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:34,330
in a real market I think the price

421
00:17:32,169 --> 00:17:36,180
should be more like five or ten dollars

422
00:17:34,329 --> 00:17:38,759
an ounce at max

423
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:41,820
maybe less than that maybe with taxes

424
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:44,190
five or ten dollars currently it's 400

425
00:17:41,819 --> 00:17:47,789
that money's going into the black market

426
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:50,160
it's going into the hands of the people

427
00:17:47,789 --> 00:17:51,930
who are controlling the black market and

428
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,000
unfortunately too much of that control

429
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:59,120
is in the very hands of those who are

430
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:03,359
who we hire to prohibit it the police

431
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:05,699
agencies and the marijuana task forces

432
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:07,589
they not only seize our property to fund

433
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:09,480
their bureaucracy but they take the

434
00:18:07,589 --> 00:18:11,730
drugs and sell them on the black market

435
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:14,490
and line their own pockets our

436
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:16,860
initiative will stop that give us a hand

437
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:19,230
with the Oregon cannabis Tax Act you can

438
00:18:16,859 --> 00:18:23,219
do that once again call us two three

439
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:24,539
five four six oh six well we are our

440
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:26,430
government both the Oregon State

441
00:18:24,539 --> 00:18:28,589
government our federal government spends

442
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:31,670
you know so much money on this you know

443
00:18:28,589 --> 00:18:35,609
war on drugs are the ones some drugs for

444
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:36,750
what results very little results you

445
00:18:35,609 --> 00:18:39,869
know from their point of view they

446
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:42,000
people still use cannabis at a you know

447
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:44,939
at the same rate as they pretty much

448
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,670
always have and you know what we're

449
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:49,680
saying is education is a way to go take

450
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:52,590
that money they're gonna you know thrown

451
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:54,299
away on this war on drugs and educating

452
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:57,029
people so people can can make a choice

453
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:59,009
you know you know all of our founding

454
00:18:57,029 --> 00:19:01,379
fathers called in code of our country

455
00:18:59,009 --> 00:19:03,329
you know I'll believe in education as

456
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:06,180
you know education would make great

457
00:19:03,329 --> 00:19:08,909
citizens you know that whole time care

458
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:10,740
you know in the 1700s all across you

459
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:12,930
know they grew help yeah but all across

460
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:15,210
Europe that you know in the US they said

461
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:17,340
education is the key they believe that

462
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:19,590
within 100 years we'd reach this

463
00:19:17,339 --> 00:19:22,409
wonderful age where everybody Kate and

464
00:19:19,589 --> 00:19:24,869
we all be living a great life but you

465
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:26,610
know instead we're in this Jefferson's

466
00:19:24,869 --> 00:19:28,439
worst nightmare we have a clean State

467
00:19:26,609 --> 00:19:30,750
Thomas Jefferson I think would be

468
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:31,200
rolling over in his grave to see that

469
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:33,119
hemp

470
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:36,960
was prohibited today you know Thomas

471
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:38,849
Jefferson brought certain hemp fiber

472
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:42,569
strains into the United States from

473
00:19:38,849 --> 00:19:45,769
Italy he also invented a device to

474
00:19:42,569 --> 00:19:48,450
process hemp fiber that device

475
00:19:45,769 --> 00:19:49,308
mechanised hemp fiber production by

476
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:52,909
having a mu

477
00:19:49,308 --> 00:19:55,908
we'll drive the device that was addict

478
00:19:52,909 --> 00:19:59,090
or negating hemp fiber taking the bass

479
00:19:55,909 --> 00:20:00,950
fiber away from the herd fiber and he

480
00:19:59,089 --> 00:20:02,959
said that he was going to patent this

481
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:04,460
device so that he could give it away for

482
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,740
free and that's what he did it was like

483
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:08,450
the tenth patent granted here in the

484
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:10,878
United States he said he wanted to

485
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:13,749
patent it to prevent some interloping

486
00:20:10,878 --> 00:20:17,199
patent D from profiteering from

487
00:20:13,749 --> 00:20:21,139
distributing it and stopping people from

488
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:23,419
using it so you know we're trying to

489
00:20:21,138 --> 00:20:26,689
change that you know even George

490
00:20:23,419 --> 00:20:29,090
Washington grew him he even experimented

491
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:31,580
with hemp and said that he found the art

492
00:20:29,089 --> 00:20:35,298
of quote the artificial preparation of

493
00:20:31,579 --> 00:20:37,878
hemp from Silesia of real curiosity in

494
00:20:35,298 --> 00:20:40,069
quote I don't think he was talking about

495
00:20:37,878 --> 00:20:42,709
paper or fabric there folks

496
00:20:40,069 --> 00:20:45,349
the real curiosity said he had liked to

497
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:47,419
have more time to use this artificial

498
00:20:45,349 --> 00:20:49,128
preparation of him he was president when

499
00:20:47,419 --> 00:20:51,110
he wrote this letter to a doctor in

500
00:20:49,128 --> 00:20:53,418
England who sent him this artificial

501
00:20:51,109 --> 00:20:55,668
preparation of him said he'd have to

502
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:58,639
make more time for that with the winding

503
00:20:55,669 --> 00:21:00,860
up of a session of Congress you know the

504
00:20:58,638 --> 00:21:03,349
very founders of our country were hemp

505
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:06,528
farmers and they would be shocked to see

506
00:21:03,349 --> 00:21:08,418
today that hemp was prohibited yeah it's

507
00:21:06,528 --> 00:21:10,460
it's a sad we have people you know

508
00:21:08,419 --> 00:21:12,950
getting together you know the

509
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:14,749
pharmaceutical industry and the prison

510
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:18,740
industry and the police industry all

511
00:21:14,749 --> 00:21:20,480
working together to ban a simple plan to

512
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:22,519
you know to take away our freedoms a

513
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,558
freedom of choice because you know if

514
00:21:22,519 --> 00:21:26,509
people got to realize that I think they

515
00:21:24,558 --> 00:21:29,778
also they realize that if we're allowed

516
00:21:26,509 --> 00:21:31,579
to choose our own intoxicant we'll make

517
00:21:29,778 --> 00:21:33,589
it all demand make other choices for

518
00:21:31,579 --> 00:21:35,509
ourselves at the government right now

519
00:21:33,589 --> 00:21:37,249
make so many choices for if doesn't

520
00:21:35,509 --> 00:21:39,829
allow us to choose so you know

521
00:21:37,249 --> 00:21:41,749
everything you can think of that you

522
00:21:39,829 --> 00:21:43,278
know that they can't allow us to choose

523
00:21:41,749 --> 00:21:46,730
our own toxicant because then we'll

524
00:21:43,278 --> 00:21:50,089
start to think for ourselves and that

525
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:52,548
prison police pharmaceutical industry

526
00:21:50,089 --> 00:21:55,009
just won't allow that yeah yeah when

527
00:21:52,548 --> 00:21:57,679
they prohibited him you know I think

528
00:21:55,009 --> 00:22:00,798
that one of the key factors was the fact

529
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:02,450
that him produces more oil and that than

530
00:22:00,798 --> 00:22:04,460
any other plant produces

531
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:07,039
three times more oil than any other

532
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:08,960
plant seed oil crop that's available

533
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:11,569
today and that hemp seed oil will run

534
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:13,490
any diesel engine with no conversion

535
00:22:11,569 --> 00:22:15,439
fact the diesel engine the first

536
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:18,380
internal combustion engines were

537
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:21,259
invented to run on hemp seed oil back in

538
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:23,720
1884 and it was fifteen years before

539
00:22:21,259 --> 00:22:25,849
they synthesized petroleum to be like

540
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:27,950
hemp seed oil so that they could replace

541
00:22:25,849 --> 00:22:29,779
hemp seed oil and the reason they wanted

542
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:32,690
to replace it is because they can do

543
00:22:29,779 --> 00:22:35,899
that in a centralised math method takes

544
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:38,809
millions of dollars to find oil and

545
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:42,050
produce petroleum takes billions to

546
00:22:38,809 --> 00:22:43,669
refine it it's a it's a very capital

547
00:22:42,049 --> 00:22:45,349
intensive industry and then once you've

548
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:47,240
already invested in that you're not

549
00:22:45,349 --> 00:22:49,189
going to let go of it so you want to you

550
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:50,930
know make sure you can you know give

551
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:54,230
money to your favorite congressmen and

552
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:58,610
Senators and we'll vote your way to keep

553
00:22:54,230 --> 00:23:00,980
on the prohibition of cannabis was very

554
00:22:58,609 --> 00:23:02,779
very labor intensive

555
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:05,000
capital intensive that labor capital

556
00:23:02,779 --> 00:23:07,160
intensive and it's just sort of

557
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:11,599
insidious the way has grown up and

558
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:13,970
stopped all research into modern-day

559
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:17,509
industrial applications of of cannabis

560
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:21,140
and byproducts like a whole exploding

561
00:23:17,509 --> 00:23:23,379
field in the 20s in early 30s was

562
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:25,790
finally always wonderful new uses for

563
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:28,280
cannabis it was kind of stopped Coleman

564
00:23:25,789 --> 00:23:30,730
tracks from these you know the oil

565
00:23:28,279 --> 00:23:33,529
people and the pharmaceutical people

566
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:35,900
they're out there you know just saying

567
00:23:33,529 --> 00:23:37,339
no you can't you can't have it and they

568
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:40,280
got together with the bureau of

569
00:23:37,339 --> 00:23:43,189
narcotics in the u.s. and put a stop to

570
00:23:40,279 --> 00:23:45,049
it and and pearls propaganda so people

571
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:47,509
would forget that it was ever a

572
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:52,299
beneficial plan they totally separate

573
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:54,740
the beneficial uses from you know the I

574
00:23:52,299 --> 00:23:56,869
don't know well they made up a whole

575
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:59,269
misinformation campaign they said that

576
00:23:56,869 --> 00:24:01,429
marijuana caused people to go crazy and

577
00:23:59,269 --> 00:24:03,650
kill their family and friends and in

578
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:05,870
fact it doesn't do that we know that

579
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:07,820
today but they made up this propaganda

580
00:24:05,869 --> 00:24:09,649
misinformation campaign so they could

581
00:24:07,819 --> 00:24:11,079
prohibit it at the time you know Henry

582
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:14,890
Ford

583
00:24:11,079 --> 00:24:17,230
had invented a car that the body was

584
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:19,419
made from hemp fiber and hemp seed oil

585
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:22,569
they fire and it was like fiberglass

586
00:24:19,419 --> 00:24:24,730
today and I've seen old videotapes from

587
00:24:22,569 --> 00:24:26,470
the 20s and early 30s where they take a

588
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:29,048
sledge hammer and they swing it down

589
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:31,210
onto the car doesn't make a scratch it

590
00:24:29,048 --> 00:24:33,940
doesn't make a dent in that vehicle

591
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:36,610
Henry Ford had synthesized the car made

592
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:38,320
with hemp fiber the entire body was and

593
00:24:36,609 --> 00:24:40,538
that's another one of the reasons it's

594
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:43,450
prohibited you know it's all about money

595
00:24:40,538 --> 00:24:46,778
it has nothing to do with drugs the drug

596
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:49,360
issue is pardoned upon a smokescreen and

597
00:24:46,778 --> 00:24:52,298
it's meant to detract from the real

598
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:55,089
issue fortunately today it's this prison

599
00:24:52,298 --> 00:24:57,158
industrial complex where we see more

600
00:24:55,089 --> 00:25:02,699
people in jail than any other country in

601
00:24:57,159 --> 00:25:05,440
the history of the world and and this

602
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:08,440
destruction of our civil liberties and

603
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:10,538
the intrusion into our bedroom they not

604
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:12,399
even not only do they intrude into our

605
00:25:10,538 --> 00:25:12,879
bedrooms and our homes to see what we're

606
00:25:12,398 --> 00:25:15,518
using

607
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:17,889
they'll test our urine and test our hair

608
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:21,538
and try to say that we're using an

609
00:25:17,888 --> 00:25:24,369
illegal herb now this is an herb that

610
00:25:21,538 --> 00:25:26,288
people the views for thousands and

611
00:25:24,369 --> 00:25:28,959
thousands of years yeah and there's no

612
00:25:26,288 --> 00:25:31,329
you know and with very little harmful

613
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,679
effects no harmful effects I mean you

614
00:25:31,329 --> 00:25:34,720
know as people like it's like drinking a

615
00:25:32,679 --> 00:25:36,909
martini after work at your home and you

616
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,740
put your feet up and turn on the TV set

617
00:25:36,909 --> 00:25:40,510
and drink your martini well a lot of

618
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:43,089
people do the same thing with with

619
00:25:40,509 --> 00:25:46,450
cannabis put your feet up turn TV and

620
00:25:43,089 --> 00:25:48,038
roll themselves you know a joint and

621
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:50,500
that's all we're saying is get people

622
00:25:48,038 --> 00:25:55,240
that choice so whether you know they can

623
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:56,980
choose the intoxication in toxic so they

624
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:58,929
can choose a medicine that they like and

625
00:25:56,980 --> 00:26:00,849
prefer and they can grow the crops that

626
00:25:58,929 --> 00:26:04,269
they like and prefer and use the paper

627
00:26:00,849 --> 00:26:07,058
that makes more paper than trees do

628
00:26:04,269 --> 00:26:09,460
according to USDA bullet in 404 hemp

629
00:26:07,058 --> 00:26:11,648
produces four times more paper than the

630
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:13,960
most productive tree species that's a

631
00:26:11,648 --> 00:26:16,359
waste product from making canvas row

632
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:17,860

662
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:32,370
friends and we all be out there

663
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,409
petitioning and the one guy of group of

664
00:27:32,369 --> 00:27:36,538
friends will come over and sign it and

665
00:27:34,409 --> 00:27:38,159
the rest of us friends won't you know

666
00:27:36,538 --> 00:27:40,079

668
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:44,220
it next time unfortunately a lot of

669
00:27:41,819 --> 00:27:46,048
people are afraid to sign it they think

670
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:48,870
their names are going to go on some list

671
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:50,158
I can tell you that if we don't get

672
00:27:48,869 --> 00:27:53,069
enough signatures we're not even going

673
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:54,330
to turn it in but if we do get enough

674
00:27:53,069 --> 00:27:56,189
signatures we turn it in to the

675
00:27:54,329 --> 00:27:59,220
Secretary of State's office then they

676
00:27:56,190 --> 00:28:01,679
only keep it for 60 days to validate

677
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:03,509
that the people who signed it only 2% of

678
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:07,830
the people who signed it are registered

679
00:28:03,509 --> 00:28:09,599
voters so that's what they do they

680
00:28:07,829 --> 00:28:11,369
aren't checking it to see where you live

681
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:13,949
they aren't putting it on some master

682
00:28:11,369 --> 00:28:16,798
police list it's going just to validate

683
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:19,080
that people who sign it or registered

684
00:28:16,798 --> 00:28:21,329

694
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:46,350
hemp grows more in a single sentence and

695
00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:48,480
than any other crop in the temperate

696
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:50,669
cooler climates produces more fiber

697
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:53,009
protein and oil than any other plant on

698
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:55,650
this planet and to prohibit the plant

699
00:28:53,009 --> 00:28:58,349
that produces more fiber protein and oil

700
00:28:55,650 --> 00:29:01,860
than any other plant that to me is truly

701
00:28:58,349 --> 00:29:04,619
evil so help us put this on the ballot

702
00:29:01,859 --> 00:29:07,969
