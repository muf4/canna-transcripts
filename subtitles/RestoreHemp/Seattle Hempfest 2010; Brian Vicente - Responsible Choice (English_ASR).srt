1
00:00:00,919 --> 00:00:05,240
hi everyone uh my name is Brian vente

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:08,919
I'm an attorney uh and I run sensible

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:10,960
Colorado which is a um nonprofit

4
00:00:08,919 --> 00:00:13,919
organization in Colorado we've been

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:16,480
around since 2004 and our work is sort

6
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:18,079
of bifurcated we're we're the lead uh

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,880
organization that works on behalf of

8
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:23,479
Colorado's medical marijuana patients um

9
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:25,919
and a fascinating fact there is is uh

10
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:27,960
about two years ago there were maybe

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,000
4,000 Colorado medical marijuana

12
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,439
patients and there's over a 100,000

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,679
today so our our phone let's give him a

14
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:36,640
round of

15
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:38,479
applause um our our phones certainly

16
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,000
ring quite a bit more now than they did

17
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:42,038
two years ago which is a little

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,039
overwhelming um we also sensible

19
00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:46,480
Colorado we also work on broader uh

20
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:48,520
marijuana reform issues and I've really

21
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:50,640
for you know my entire professional

22
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:54,600
career been working to dismantle the war

23
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:57,640
on drugs and um as much as um and so I

24
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,920
guess I'm happy to follow the senator

25
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:01,320
because I think we have to move on

26
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,559
multiple fronts it's wonderful to see um

27
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,359
legislators taking this up but what can

28
00:01:03,558 --> 00:01:07,560
citizens do right what can your average

29
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:10,719
Joe do and I think to some extent

30
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:12,560
Colorado um has sort of forged a path

31
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:14,640
which has been a road map for other

32
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,600
states and other activists maybe to get

33
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,560
involved in I think we are really close

34
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:21,239
um to ending the government's war on

35
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,519
marijuana in Colorado I think that'll

36
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:25,000
happen within a couple years and it has

37
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:26,158
not been an easy road we've learned a

38
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,478
lot of lessons and I just kind of want

39
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:32,159
to lay out a little of what we've done

40
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:33,719
um the underlying kind of theme of what

41
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,478
where the activism has been at in

42
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:38,239
Colorado is we've been all about forcing

43
00:01:35,478 --> 00:01:40,719
the discussion of this issue and as a

44
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:43,798
you know when I graduated law school in

45
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:46,118
2004 and of course my classmates were

46
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:47,880
going on to firm jobs you know working

47
00:01:46,118 --> 00:01:49,478
in the business corporate world or

48
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:51,239
perhaps being a district attorney I

49
00:01:49,478 --> 00:01:53,200
didn't hang out with those people but um

50
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:54,239
you know public defender what have you

51
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,280
um you know I said well I'm actually

52
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:58,959
going to work on on marijuana reform you

53
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:01,560
I worked for uh MPP for a little while

54
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:03,158
and and then got sble Colorado going and

55
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,719
honestly people kind of laughed and

56
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:06,399
didn't take me seriously and and were

57
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:08,840
sort of like well you know this is this

58
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:11,360
is kind of a joke and I think we've seen

59
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:13,878
an evolution where you know those same

60
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,800
people um that would not return my phone

61
00:02:13,878 --> 00:02:17,199
calls whether there's legislators that I

62
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,040
would just wanted to talk about the you

63
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:21,000
know the word marijuana would just turn

64
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:23,519
people off and I really think we've gone

65
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,400
from from marijuana you know just people

66
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:27,759
snickering when they've heard that to

67
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:30,200
this being a legitimacy a legitimate

68
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:31,799
policy issue right and the the way I

69
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:34,079
think we've done that is by forcing

70
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,640
people to say the word marijuana to read

71
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,319
the word marijuana to hear about

72
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:39,878
marijuana on the news whether it's

73
00:02:37,318 --> 00:02:41,759
medical patients or students standing up

74
00:02:39,878 --> 00:02:43,679
and saying you know we're tired of of

75
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:45,878
policies that push us towards using

76
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,719
alcohol which is a much more dangerous

77
00:02:45,878 --> 00:02:50,280
drug we should be able to allow we

78
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:52,158
should be allowed to use marijuana uh in

79
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,080
in the dorms or at parties and not be

80
00:02:52,158 --> 00:02:57,318
punished not be kicked out of school for

81
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:59,879
using a less harmful drug and so really

82
00:02:57,318 --> 00:03:01,919
um I think that discussion has been key

83
00:02:59,878 --> 00:03:03,399
key to getting uh people like the

84
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:05,839
senator and people like senators in

85
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:08,480
Colorado to to consider this issue more

86
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:11,920
seriously and to to to uh begin to

87
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:13,759
tackle it um in short you know what

88
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:16,719
happened in Colorado on a recreational

89
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:19,639
front was really kicked off by students

90
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:23,439
uh in 2004 and we had uh two of the

91
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:25,359
biggest uh universities in our state uh

92
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:27,598
Colorado University in Boulder which

93
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,120
like 50,000 plus people and then

94
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:31,959
Colorado State University in Fort

95
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:34,680
Collins uh take on the issue of of

96
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:37,080
marijuana versus alcohol right and it

97
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:39,640
was led by my uh bra the brave brothers

98
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:41,879
and sisters at safer that I work with um

99
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:43,438
and I was involved to some extent but

100
00:03:41,878 --> 00:03:45,798
essentially students saying enough is

101
00:03:43,438 --> 00:03:47,878
enough we want our policies uh at least

102
00:03:45,799 --> 00:03:50,400
at least in the student level right in

103
00:03:47,878 --> 00:03:53,158
our handbook in our in our University

104
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,760
code to reflect the fact that that uh

105
00:03:53,158 --> 00:03:57,120
marijuana penalties should not be

106
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:59,280
greater than the penalties for alcohol

107
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,120
and both of those measures passed right

108
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:05,000
so it's kind of a radicalized student

109
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:07,280
movement to Kickstart this in Colorado

110
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,318
and That Was Then launched into Denver

111
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,719
the capital the capital of Colorado um

112
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:15,039
initiative campaign was run much like

113
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:16,600
it's going to be happening here in 2011

114
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:18,120
where enough citizens get together

115
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,799
enough citizens sign a piece of paper

116
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,399
and you can put something you can bypass

117
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:24,120
the legislature right put put uh use

118
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:25,758
direct democracy put it in front of the

119
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,639
people and that's exactly what happened

120
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,479
in Denver and I I worked to some extent

121
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:31,160
on that campaign and I got to tell you

122
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:32,478
no nobody thought it was going to win

123
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,880
right nobody thought it was going to win

124
00:04:32,478 --> 00:04:36,439
and at the end of the day Denver you

125
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:38,879
know essentially a city of 2 million

126
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:42,680
people became the first city in history

127
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:44,879
to legalize marijuana right worldwide I

128
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:49,560
mean this is just

129
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:52,120
enormous just enormous news um you know

130
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:53,800
and uh maybe idealists like myself

131
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:56,240
thought well now that we have actually

132
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:58,680
changed the Denver marijuana law our

133
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:01,600
city code to say that adults 21 and

134
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:03,199
older should not punished uh for

135
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,280
possessing marijuana maybe things will

136
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:07,960
change and in fact the arrest continued

137
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:09,478
and it was kind of maddening uh to to me

138
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:10,879
and other activists and probably to many

139
00:05:09,478 --> 00:05:13,000
voters that said you know this is

140
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:14,839
[ __ ] you know we voted on this and

141
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,160
the police have have not really um

142
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:20,359
respected that so uh moving on from

143
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:23,280
there a Statewide push was run uh the ne

144
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:25,439
the following year it only got 41% but

145
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:27,038
41% ain't bad you know and we've shown

146
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:29,038
that we're actually gaining support

147
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:32,038
every year we went back to Denver with

148
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:33,639
another initi itive uh in 2007 which was

149
00:05:32,038 --> 00:05:36,000
the lowest law enforcement priority

150
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:38,840
initiative very similar to what Seattle

151
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,560
has uh in that basically says for police

152
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:44,599
and prosecutors uh marijuana possession

153
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:46,720
uh should be the lowest priority and uh

154
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:48,479
we appointed a mayor's panel I serve on

155
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,240
that panel I'm the chair actually and

156
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:51,879
the the vice chair is a police officer

157
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,160
it's it's uncomfortable meeting

158
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:56,240
sometimes but um you know we've seen a

159
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:59,280
sort of downward Trend I think in the

160
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:01,160
arrest which has been positive so um the

161
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:03,879
other quick aspect you know we've had

162
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:06,880
some other action in Colorado people in

163
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:08,839
Breen Ridge people in um Durango people

164
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:10,719
in in smaller cities gotten together and

165
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:13,239
changed their local laws and all that

166
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,440
helps I mean it really gets news out

167
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:18,199
there and and and all of these events

168
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:20,038
all of these um changes in our laws are

169
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:22,439
accompanied by people like me people

170
00:06:20,038 --> 00:06:25,240
like you writing press releases sending

171
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:26,918
it out uh it you know emailing out press

172
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,478
releases getting having press

173
00:06:26,918 --> 00:06:30,918
conferences things like that that maybe

174
00:06:28,478 --> 00:06:32,318
can be seem a little little um intuitive

175
00:06:30,918 --> 00:06:34,318
we're not taught how to do that in law

176
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:36,800
school or in college frankly but it's

177
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,439
incredibly important to do um to get the

178
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,800
word out so you're actually reaching a

179
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:41,560
broader audience you're getting people

180
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,400
to think about marijuana to read about

181
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:45,879
it in their local paper in the state

182
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:48,560
paper you know your stunts on the news

183
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:50,240
that sort of thing um you know can just

184
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,120
be incredibly useful you know the

185
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:55,280
medical marijuana stuff in Colorado um

186
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,959
we've of course it was initially brought

187
00:06:55,279 --> 00:07:01,159
on by the people uh in 2000 we got our

188
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:03,120
medical marijuana law and then um we've

189
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:05,479
had this just incredible growth in our

190
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,560
program which which I pointed out and

191
00:07:05,478 --> 00:07:09,839
that actually uh led to the legislature

192
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,759
picking this up so again um we have the

193
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:13,839
people kind of driving the boat and

194
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:15,879
eventually 8 years after our law passed

195
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:18,159
the excuse me 10 years after our law

196
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:20,080
passed the legislature decided oh well

197
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,840
we're actually going to regulate this

198
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:24,800
and uh we passed just an absolute

199
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:27,318
Landmark piece of legislation uh last

200
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:31,520
year in the Colorado um legislative

201
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:31,520
session which is the most

202
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:34,440
Capital trying to either do damage

203
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:36,399
control or push is um push provisions of

204
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:38,200
that law which would help patients and

205
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,120
help their providers and and to to a

206
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:42,320
large degree we're successful so I'm

207
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,918
going to stop going babbling on and turn

208
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:48,800
things over to to Douglas but I look

209
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:48,799
forward to a dialogue later on thanks
