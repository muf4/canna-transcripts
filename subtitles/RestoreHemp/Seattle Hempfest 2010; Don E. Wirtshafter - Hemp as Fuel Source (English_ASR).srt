1
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:08,839
in in the uh '90s we were making hemp

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:10,039
oil in Ohio with Chinese seeds and it

3
00:00:08,839 --> 00:00:13,039
got pretty

4
00:00:10,039 --> 00:00:15,000
popular and then we started taking the

5
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:17,640
seed cake the waste product and making

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,118
hempen ale out of it and that got so

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,679
popular that we were producing oil 24/7

8
00:00:20,118 --> 00:00:24,719
around the clock and I ended up with

9
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:27,559
6,000 extra barrels 6,000 extra gallons

10
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:30,479
of oil cuz we were making it for the

11
00:00:27,559 --> 00:00:32,839
seat cake at that point so that became

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,759
the oil that powered the hemp car coming

13
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:37,600
out here 10 years ago if you recall at

14
00:00:34,759 --> 00:00:41,039
Hempfest we had a one of the first

15
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:44,558
biodel powered cars was here running on

16
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:46,359
hemp fuel we powered Woody helson's bus

17
00:00:44,558 --> 00:00:48,479
from uh down the West Coast in the

18
00:00:46,359 --> 00:00:49,960
further movie starting here in Seattle

19
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:52,279
and going down the coast most of them

20
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:54,640
riding the bicycles but with the bus

21
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:58,198
following them up and so we proved a

22
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:00,960
long time ago that we can do this we ran

23
00:00:58,198 --> 00:01:04,519
the the generators here on biodiesel one

24
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,960
year hemp biodiesel it can be done uh

25
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:09,000
it's extremely convertible but yeah

26
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:11,399
that's right the there's a lot more

27
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,200
energy in the hemp plant than just the

28
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,560
oil and there's actually a man here

29
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:19,960
named aguadas he's here at hempest I saw

30
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:22,920
him last night and he's got a patent for

31
00:01:19,959 --> 00:01:25,719
pyrolization in a in a new way that is

32
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:28,840
uh very promising for turning much more

33
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:31,078
of the hemp plant into energy source I I

34
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:33,759
I kind of discourage

35
00:01:31,078 --> 00:01:36,199
H for energy cuz it's so expensive why

36
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:39,759
would you take $40 a gallon oil and burn

37
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:41,719
it up in your car but pyrolization gives

38
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:47,478
us the opportunity to actually create

39
00:01:41,719 --> 00:01:47,478
fuel economically and it's coming
