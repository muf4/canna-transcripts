1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,730
hi there let's review a little history

2
00:00:02,428 --> 00:00:08,359
here I know that marijuana camp cannabis

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:11,070
has been a vital part of our society

4
00:00:08,359 --> 00:00:13,259
before the Industrial Revolution it was

5
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:15,839
eighty percent of the world's Commerce

6
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:18,868
that was a good reason for them to try

7
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:21,179
to eliminate you as a grower because

8
00:00:18,868 --> 00:00:23,490
that was the material that built homes

9
00:00:21,179 --> 00:00:26,789
made beautiful clothes for me to wear

10
00:00:23,489 --> 00:00:29,038
fine paper that does hold up much better

11
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:32,359
than the trees were killing and it does

12
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:36,899
not destroy the awesome in fact it real

13
00:00:32,359 --> 00:00:39,420
oxygenates the planet so they stay made

14
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:42,179
a prohibition way back then but in the

15
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:47,189
United States it actually began 101

16
00:00:42,179 --> 00:00:48,988
years ago in 1913 by 1913 it was totally

17
00:00:47,189 --> 00:00:50,729
outlawed in the state of California and

18
00:00:48,988 --> 00:00:52,649
the hearse press was spreading their

19
00:00:50,729 --> 00:00:55,500
lives and misinformation which is the

20
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:59,520
only basis that was used for this

21
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:01,198
prohibition by the time 1937 came around

22
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,539
several states had joined that

23
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:07,259
prohibition and kept out into the list

24
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:09,570
by 1950 we began to realize that what

25
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:12,750
they had really Albert out Lord was this

26
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:14,879
wonderful thing called cannabis the

27
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:17,040
greatest medicine known and the oldest

28
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:21,298
medicine known to humanity which has

29
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:24,299
never killed anyone people began to use

30
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:26,580
it recreationally and try to write lost

31
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:28,650
regard to make changes since nineteen

32
00:01:26,579 --> 00:01:31,078
sixty there was a morphia and then came

33
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:33,240
normal the most exciting thing that's

34
00:01:31,078 --> 00:01:37,679
happened is in the 90 students for

35
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:40,078
sensible drug coalition are incredibly

36
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,759
brilliant young people who are making a

37
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:44,250
difference and young people all over

38
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,560
this country have been educated thanks

39
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:48,868
to the entrepreneurs and the internet

40
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,478
and the fact that so many wonderful

41
00:01:48,868 --> 00:01:55,409
books especially the Emperor wears no

42
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:57,599
clothes came back out in 1988 88 was an

43
00:01:55,409 --> 00:02:01,170
incredible year for marijuana because

44
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:04,109
also the DEA son chief administrative

45
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:06,719
law judge had had a chance to review the

46
00:02:04,109 --> 00:02:09,179
medical evidence and said that it was

47
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:11,789
the oldest medicine to known known to

48
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:13,500
humanity and for a government to come

49
00:02:11,789 --> 00:02:15,689
between a patient's

50
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:18,780
offering and the benefits of this

51
00:02:15,689 --> 00:02:22,259
substance was unreasonable arbitrary and

52
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:24,629
capricious that position came three

53
00:02:22,259 --> 00:02:26,909
weeks after I have been acquitted in the

54
00:02:24,629 --> 00:02:29,159
state of Florida because I had been

55
00:02:26,909 --> 00:02:32,250
using it to maintain the site on my left

56
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:34,439
eye by then we had destroyed my right

57
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:36,990
eye completely both through ignorance

58
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:39,240
and misinformation I had thought

59
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:41,850
marijuana was not saved and I had loud

60
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:45,390
all the cutting in my better idea I was

61
00:02:41,849 --> 00:02:48,900
totally blinded in 1987 and in 98 I came

62
00:02:45,389 --> 00:02:52,469
to court with it so I did the support in

63
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:55,409
Florida was amazing amazing amazing you

64
00:02:52,469 --> 00:02:57,239
covered my trial you covered all the

65
00:02:55,409 --> 00:03:00,000
things that happened prior to that and

66
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:02,659
you supported me norm can't four is now

67
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,969
the director of normal did it pro bono

68
00:03:02,659 --> 00:03:08,250
since then I have discovered the history

69
00:03:05,969 --> 00:03:11,400
of the prohibition and can never stay

70
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:13,709
home because in 1990 I met one Jack hair

71
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,539
who wrote the Emperor wears no clothes

72
00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:18,509
and who made me very much aware that we

73
00:03:15,539 --> 00:03:21,509
were arresting 250 to 300 thousand

74
00:03:18,509 --> 00:03:23,729
people a year but nothing has gotten

75
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:27,030
better in spite of the hundreds of

76
00:03:23,729 --> 00:03:29,250
thousands of us who work endlessly and

77
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:33,599
have been working for generations to

78
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:35,669
change these laws in spite of that the

79
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:37,849
lies continue they still have the same

80
00:03:35,669 --> 00:03:40,768
arguments the difference is that now

81
00:03:37,849 --> 00:03:43,169
because of the youth learning from us

82
00:03:40,769 --> 00:03:45,870
especially in the nineties because all

83
00:03:43,169 --> 00:03:47,458
the dedication that comes with that

84
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:50,879
youth because of a sense of

85
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:53,840
responsibility that comes as a result of

86
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:57,419
using marijuana because once you enhance

87
00:03:53,840 --> 00:04:00,509
your awareness level by opening those

88
00:03:57,419 --> 00:04:02,909
receptors and you didn't use before you

89
00:04:00,509 --> 00:04:05,548
become more aware of your responsibility

90
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:07,949
towards yourself and the planet and it

91
00:04:05,549 --> 00:04:10,829
is for that reason that I am saying now

92
00:04:07,949 --> 00:04:12,959
that she knew and now that you've had

93
00:04:10,829 --> 00:04:16,379
hundreds of thousands of us who have

94
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:19,079
been arrested repeatedly yeah we we have

95
00:04:16,379 --> 00:04:22,168
joined this war we've been forced to

96
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:24,530
fight this war on us that they call the

97
00:04:22,168 --> 00:04:27,120
war on drugs drugs are not going to jail

98
00:04:24,529 --> 00:04:29,909
200 200

99
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:34,019
nobody see 25 million of us have been

100
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:35,820
arrested 2,000 every day still today you

101
00:04:34,019 --> 00:04:38,939
cannot afford this prohibition at a

102
00:04:35,819 --> 00:04:42,379
moral level at a medical level at a

103
00:04:38,939 --> 00:04:45,689
financial level so it's up to you to

104
00:04:42,379 --> 00:04:48,689
join us hundreds of thousands of us who

105
00:04:45,689 --> 00:04:51,389
have been working at and remember most

106
00:04:48,689 --> 00:04:54,329
of us were not necessarily willing

107
00:04:51,389 --> 00:04:57,240
victims we were hammered with a war on

108
00:04:54,329 --> 00:05:00,240
drugs and have no choice but to stand up

109
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:03,930
for our self preservation and survival

110
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:06,000
and in instincts which of course can not

111
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:08,879
be outlawed you can no doubt myself

112
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,560
survive self preservation and survival

113
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:12,959
and that's what you're asking us to do

114
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,329
if you maintain this loss please join us

115
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:17,159
and this nightmare whether you're in

116
00:05:15,329 --> 00:05:18,899
Alaska whether you're in New York

117
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,490
whether you're in Oregon where you're

118
00:05:18,899 --> 00:05:22,799
going to make it legal for anyone over

119
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:25,530
40 or whether you're still working on

120
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,990
the medical marijuana it is all urgent

121
00:05:25,529 --> 00:05:31,319
the message needs to be loud and clear

122
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:33,750
the substance Control Act is the hammer

123
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:36,089
that shot that coffin for us back in

124
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:39,060
nineteen seventy when richard nixon

125
00:05:36,089 --> 00:05:42,439
hired a team of his own friends to tell

126
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:45,930
him marijuana should be decriminalized

127
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:48,598
that it was no danger to anyone and he

128
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:50,250
decided he was not going to reward the

129
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:52,529
hippies know what were they called and

130
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:55,228
bit NEETs who had stopped his forum

131
00:05:52,529 --> 00:05:58,429
vietnam and he appointed elvis presley

132
00:05:55,228 --> 00:06:01,409
as his first drugs arts the hell i went

133
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:04,259
ignorance blinds us is what that proves

134
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:06,539
repeatedly but you have broken through

135
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:10,740
the dark night of ignorance when you

136
00:06:06,538 --> 00:06:13,560
made california legal back in 1996 the

137
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:16,978
dark knight of ignorance has ended the

138
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:20,490
dawn of days here and it's all to you to

139
00:06:16,978 --> 00:06:24,029
bring it into its full beautiful sight

140
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:27,449
we need to end this prohibition at all

141
00:06:24,029 --> 00:06:30,359
levels hemp should be a vital part of

142
00:06:27,449 --> 00:06:33,509
our economy our farmers should be making

143
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:36,240
money not being thrown in jail and you

144
00:06:33,509 --> 00:06:38,759
need homes that are much harder to burn

145
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,350
down these days especially in dry areas

146
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:43,949
like the Arizona Calif

147
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:46,470
even a lot of fires in Florida there's

148
00:06:43,949 --> 00:06:48,479
just fires all over that could be

149
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:51,000
alleviated a great deal by building

150
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:53,280
properly and not use so many chemicals

151
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,620

a chance to acquire a cancer and most of

158
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:15,720
it has to do with substituting this one

madness Florida is trying to make sure

168
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:40,290
that other people have a right to call

169
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:42,960
debated possess their medical marijuana

170
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:44,430
and of course we're with them in spirit

171
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:47,189
I am there in the spirit of gratitude

172
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:49,199
they are the ones who made it happen for

173
00:07:47,189 --> 00:07:50,910
me and I know so I know they're

174
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:54,420
compassionate people if given the

175
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:56,070
opportunity education is the key to all

176
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:59,460
the answers that's what all the elders

177
00:07:56,069 --> 00:08:03,180
have taught me and most of them were

178
00:07:59,459 --> 00:08:06,329
younger than I am in fact my elders turn

179
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:08,400
out to be kids from 18 to 25 to took to

180
00:08:06,329 --> 00:08:10,469
that road and we did every state in this

181
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:14,310
country repeatedly for two or three

182
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:16,440
years and then join the help you co mo

183
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:18,629
he joined us actually with the cannabis

184
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:20,569
Action Network and we continue to travel

185
00:08:18,629 --> 00:08:23,730
the country for another year or two

186
00:08:20,569 --> 00:08:25,829
after that all with the purpose of

187
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:27,990
educating America and learning and

188
00:08:25,829 --> 00:08:30,659
teaching as quickly as we passed it on

189
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:34,080
to you and it has paid off I got you on

190
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:36,418
my side thank you what surprised me was

191
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,129
the reception that we got us we traveled

192
00:08:36,418 --> 00:08:39,870
it wasn't like Oh what are those hold

193
00:08:38,129 --> 00:08:41,549
people talking to us about me there were

194
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:44,038
all ears because they were not getting

195
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:46,289
education and we had that they were

196
00:08:44,038 --> 00:08:49,039
getting there that was a poor excuse for

197
00:08:46,289 --> 00:08:51,959
education I was very sad to travel and

198
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:53,909
hear the stories this kids could tell a

199
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:55,440
horrible parenting day

200
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:57,240
I don't tell 10 years ago when your

201
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,430
daddy gave up the Bruce and started

202
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,720
smoking pot only now they had to take it

203
00:08:59,429 --> 00:09:02,370
back to him so he could throw him in

204
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,370
jail for actually taking care of himself

205
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:07,200
for once and for all I mean I had to

206
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:09,299
deal with this and try to teach this

207
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,730
children that not to give up that they

208
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:13,409
can change this is a bad story but they

209
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:15,720
need to share it with legislators they

210
00:09:13,409 --> 00:09:17,399
need to put an end to it that brings us

211
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:20,190
to a very interesting part of this

212
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:23,340
prohibition in the States we have ended

213
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:28,560
medical marijuana prohibition we have

214
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:32,639
dropped in overdoses by pharmaceuticals

215
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:36,139
and I mean a whopping 26 percent we drop

216
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:42,509
plus 26 plus percent considering that

217
00:09:36,139 --> 00:09:46,740
seventy-eight percent of all deaths that

218
00:09:42,509 --> 00:09:49,110
are drug-related are with legal drugs

219
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:51,450
and prescriptions I think you need to

220
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:55,129
take note in the states for medical

221
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:59,330
marijuana is a reality we have dropped a

222
00:09:55,129 --> 00:10:02,370
26 plus percentage of drug overdoses

223
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:06,720
this is an adult drug this is God's

224
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:10,200
precious herb gift I take it in a spirit

225
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:12,480
of Thanksgiving every day cannabis does

226
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:15,270
have accepted medical value thanks to

227
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:17,190
you again 24 states have accepted it

228
00:10:15,269 --> 00:10:19,500
already and more will after this

229
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:21,840
election no doubt in my heart about it

230
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:23,639
thank you thank you thank you all of

231
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:27,290

232
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:27,289
guiding light and end this madness
