1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,029
kind of response did you get when you

2
00:00:01,379 --> 00:00:04,889
went public did you get harassed the

3
00:00:03,029 --> 00:00:11,009
police department come down on you did

4
00:00:04,889 --> 00:00:12,928
it was amazing the way I describe it and

5
00:00:11,009 --> 00:00:18,179
have described it for many years as it

6
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:19,618
rained marijuana on our house Wow the

7
00:00:18,179 --> 00:00:22,160
people the article that I read about

8
00:00:19,618 --> 00:00:25,439
finding on the doorstep and i laughed

9
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:27,778
was totally true we found it in brown

10
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:32,609
paper bags and our doorstep we got it

11
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:34,530
through the mail postage paid we also

12
00:00:32,609 --> 00:00:37,500
got it in the mailbox we live in a rural

13
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:39,719
area and we have a rural mailbox founded

14
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:43,250
in the mailbox funded on back porch and

15
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:46,879
had many people deliver it to us Wow

16
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:50,399
okay and we'll be right back after this

17
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:52,738
we're talking with maina today and may

18
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:57,719
now what I understand is that you began

19
00:00:52,738 --> 00:01:00,479
a crusade in your state to real

20
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:05,129
eagle-eyes him for medical purposes that

21
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:07,408
brought forth on October 10 1979 and a

22
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:09,630
history-making policy within your state

23
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:13,560
isn't that correct and true he chooses

24
00:01:09,629 --> 00:01:15,989
the true share that we when we decided

25
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:19,710
to go public we decided that we needed

26
00:01:15,989 --> 00:01:21,719
to be legal and so we contacted the

27
00:01:19,709 --> 00:01:23,699
legislature to see if there was a

28
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:25,650
possibility that Michigan could do this

29
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:28,200
and found that someone else had been

30
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:31,228
there before us and it was in the

31
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:36,420
process so we joined the process Keith

32
00:01:31,228 --> 00:01:38,789
went with us in early October and then

33
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:42,359
again late in October he was very ill

34
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:44,969
and we went without him and it went to a

35
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:47,700
hundred to nothing in the Senate and I

36
00:01:44,969 --> 00:01:53,609
forgotten what the count was in the

37
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:55,740
house but yes indeed it did go and now

38
00:01:53,609 --> 00:01:58,200
does that mean that in Michigan if the

39
00:01:55,739 --> 00:02:01,739
people can start using it for medical

40
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,950
purpose doesn't mean that one once the

41
00:02:01,739 --> 00:02:10,919
bill is passed then it has to be signed

42
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:13,080
and it was signed on october 22nd 1979

43
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:13,949
by the lieutenant governor of the state

44
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:20,489
of michigan

45
00:02:13,949 --> 00:02:22,949
and that was the Dare son died so given

46
00:02:20,489 --> 00:02:26,580
breath he he never received legal

47
00:02:22,949 --> 00:02:29,128
marijuana and then after that it was

48
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:32,250
over a year before the state received

49
00:02:29,128 --> 00:02:35,370
the marijuana the federal government

50
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:38,729
stands in your way and they're not

51
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:41,969
cooperative but Michigan in 33 other

52
00:02:38,729 --> 00:02:45,090
states did pass marijuana laws and

53
00:02:41,969 --> 00:02:46,650
indeed the area we live in received the

54
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:51,420
marijuana in fact i received it

55
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:53,700
personally from the state and the doctor

56
00:02:51,419 --> 00:02:56,578
that took care of Keith had encouraged

57
00:02:53,699 --> 00:03:02,119
me to work on the legality of it and he

58
00:02:56,579 --> 00:03:04,620
got a license and as time went on he

59
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:08,849
said to me may I had I can't do this

60
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:11,159
anymore and I was hurt and now for what

61
00:03:08,848 --> 00:03:13,949
I understand to an ollie was the

62
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:17,039
government slow in getting the hemp

63
00:03:13,949 --> 00:03:18,988
marijuana into the state but during this

64
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:21,689
time while it was coming in you were

65
00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:24,420
also getting hemp to other patients and

66
00:03:21,689 --> 00:03:26,759
other people not after got legal okay

67
00:03:24,419 --> 00:03:28,768
not after cat legal before it got legal

68
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:31,679
when Keith died we had a great deal of

69
00:03:28,769 --> 00:03:34,139
marijuana okay and I knew what it would

70
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:37,049
do and I would not throw it away and I

71
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:40,260
did not I did not play games about it

72
00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:41,760
and yes then the doctor said to me he

73
00:03:40,259 --> 00:03:44,969
would send me patience I have to call

74
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:46,500
him our patients and say you know if

75
00:03:44,969 --> 00:03:48,810
someone was saying doctor I'm going to

76
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:53,489
quit I'm you know dying can't be worse

77
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:56,489
and he would send them to me and well

78
00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:59,849
now didn't you feel like you're breaking

79
00:03:56,489 --> 00:04:02,129
a law didn't that now I understand that

80
00:03:59,848 --> 00:04:05,729
people of your generation have an

81
00:04:02,129 --> 00:04:10,079
ingrained thought when it comes to him

82
00:04:05,729 --> 00:04:11,759
rain washing its cough yeah that because

83
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:15,389
it's illegal it shouldn't even be

84
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:17,069
discussed let alone considered and now

85
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:21,180
yet you okay I'm in a different category

86
00:04:17,069 --> 00:04:23,550
I yes it's illegal and I found on my

87
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:26,519
children using it but we're talking

88
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:27,689
about life and death we're talking about

89
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:30,120
people

90
00:04:27,689 --> 00:04:32,870
it's not even a quality of life which is

91
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:36,079
important but it's life and death and

92
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:40,709
people there are many people who will

93
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:44,639
die and I know of several who are have

94
00:04:40,709 --> 00:04:48,500
survived because they were able to use

95
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:53,699
marijuana a dad told me just last year

96
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:57,029
this year that his son had cancer and he

97
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:59,219
refused to take the treatment and so one

98
00:04:57,029 --> 00:05:00,959
of his buddies got him stoned so he was

99
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:04,350
so happy he really didn't care what he

100
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:07,919
was doing unaware that it could help the

101
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:09,990
nausea and so he continued his treatment

102
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:13,550
and young man is alive and well today

103
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:17,939
now you shared with me that there was a

104
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:20,250
vet Vietnam vet who was paralyzed I up

105
00:05:17,939 --> 00:05:24,990
to him this year no could you tell that

106
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:30,180
okay he's a representative of disabled

107
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:32,000
veterans in southern Illinois and he

108
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:34,949
told me he had several vertebrae's

109
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,879
damaged during the war and he did some

110
00:05:34,949 --> 00:05:40,769
rehab in a hospital in in Colorado

111
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:43,290
before he left his physician took him

112
00:05:40,769 --> 00:05:45,689
aside and said I do not want you to take

113
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:47,669
the drugs that the Veterans organization

114
00:05:45,689 --> 00:05:49,379
of the hospital is going to prescribe

115
00:05:47,668 --> 00:05:54,329
for you he said I want you to take

116
00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:56,459
marijuana use marijuana smoke and the

117
00:05:54,329 --> 00:05:58,439
young man what he said he got to the way

118
00:05:56,459 --> 00:06:01,500
he was incontinent with his bladder and

119
00:05:58,439 --> 00:06:03,418
his bowels and was paralyzed he said in

120
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:07,370
five years he got so he could walk five

121
00:06:03,418 --> 00:06:11,490
miles he could also take a few steps

122
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:13,860
without the walker and that his

123
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:18,569
incontinence was under control now I

124
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:21,530
understand that aids suffers people who

125
00:06:18,569 --> 00:06:25,860
are dealing with that that disease can

126
00:06:21,529 --> 00:06:27,809
find relief with absolute with him

127
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:31,439
there's an organization called Mars

128
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:35,750
marijuana AIDS research service and it's

129
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:39,000
to help them apply for legal marijuana

130
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:40,879
it's not going well it's going better

131
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,500
than it others have but

132
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:44,180
it's very slow there's so many of them

133
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:47,569
and the government is saying they don't

134
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:52,009
have the resources and you commented

135
00:06:47,569 --> 00:06:55,550
that people with epilepsy epilepsy I I

136
00:06:52,009 --> 00:06:58,370
did a national television thing a few

137
00:06:55,550 --> 00:07:01,009
months ago and I received many many

138
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:04,189
phone calls from people with various

139
00:07:01,009 --> 00:07:06,230
illnesses and one of my recent one was a

140
00:07:04,189 --> 00:07:09,170
young woman with epilepsy and she was

141
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:12,560
from New York State couldn't drive

142
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:16,640
because of the seizures and had tried

143
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:19,459
the prescribed drugs and eventually

144
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:23,300
somehow someone talked her into smoking

145
00:07:19,459 --> 00:07:25,789
marijuana and she was seizure free for

146
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:27,620
two and a half years and I if I remember

147
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:29,030
right she said two years in her State

148
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:32,780
and she could get her driver's license

149
00:07:29,029 --> 00:07:36,159
back so she was back driving now when

150
00:07:32,779 --> 00:07:38,659
this is used for medicinal purposes

151
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,790
people think that you should do is that

152
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:43,340
just smoking it you just going to the

153
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:44,750
hospital room and say okay doctor I want

154
00:07:43,339 --> 00:07:47,599
a joint or two and you have your friends

155
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:49,310
beginning off the street and fired up is

156
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:51,890
that the only way they're gonna be used

157
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:55,310
that the best way you know it's the

158
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:57,469
fastest way okay but for someone a

159
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:59,689
cancer patient I've talked to many you

160
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:02,650
know and they have cancer because they

161
00:07:59,689 --> 00:08:06,529
smoke tobacco and they simply cannot

162
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:10,479
tolerate any any other smoke in their

163
00:08:06,529 --> 00:08:13,549
lungs so we can make brownies we can

164
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:17,509
make suppositories by making the butter

165
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:20,090
and and putting them in a capsule and

166
00:08:17,509 --> 00:08:21,860
the nurses told me for children poke

167
00:08:20,089 --> 00:08:23,359
holes in the capsule so that you don't

168
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:25,720
have to wait quite so long for the

169
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,920
castle dissolve before the the

170
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:31,550
ingredients get in the bloodstream and

171
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:33,620
also tea and I'm thinking the tea for

172
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:35,330
people my age you know we could drink an

173
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:40,219
herbal tea without a blink of an eye

174
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:44,930
okay and I was told this summer by a man

175
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:48,260
was dying of cancer that the pain the

176
00:08:44,929 --> 00:08:50,659
nausea and the appetite and that the the

177
00:08:48,259 --> 00:08:53,169
tea got into a system in like five

178
00:08:50,659 --> 00:08:54,689
minutes some of the other things the

179
00:08:53,169 --> 00:08:57,750
brownies

180
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:59,010
the suppositories vs bastards are

181
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:01,769
wonderful because you don't throw them

182
00:08:59,009 --> 00:09:04,830
back up again that's true and the

183
00:09:01,769 --> 00:09:08,159
digested foods brownies and such now you

184
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:11,400
said children now realizing that hemp is

185
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:14,519
an illegal substance for Americans to

186
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:16,740
use it's kind of unusual to hear someone

187
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:21,210
encourage that we give this to children

188
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:25,980
if you have a child dying and they are

189
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:30,570
giving you no hope whatsoever and this

190
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:32,220
is hope I have no problem with that at

191
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:36,000
all do you know of any children that

192
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:38,340
have benefited I know of one child it to

193
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,039
my knowledge and I and this was about 10

194
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:43,710
years ago and the child was so emaciated

195
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:47,099
and there was simply no other place in

196
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:50,220
his body to a poke a needle and they had

197
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:52,259
to stop treatment and to stimulate his

198
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:56,670
appetite they made him brownies and teas

199
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:59,189
and he was able to go back and continue

200
00:09:56,669 --> 00:10:01,259
his treatment and to the best of my

201
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:05,190
knowledge the wild is alive and well

202
00:10:01,259 --> 00:10:08,549
today Wow very interesting we'll be

203
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:12,270
right back after this we thought we were

204
00:10:08,549 --> 00:10:14,729
I i distributed what we had and then

205
00:10:12,269 --> 00:10:16,319
when it became legal ID I no longer well

206
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:20,820
I didn't have any more and I didn't try

207
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:22,740
to get any more but it was legal and so

208
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:24,690
I still worked with the doctor but I

209
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:27,060
didn't work directly with patients shoes

210
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:29,280
in the marijuana but eventually he

211
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:32,969
stopped using it and I was angry and

212
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:35,819
hurt and and he said to me may I cannot

213
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:38,460
spend more time doing paperwork than I

214
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:41,790
do taking care of patients and I have to

215
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:44,220
discontinue using it and and we had 34

216
00:10:41,789 --> 00:10:46,379
states where it was legal and now every

217
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:49,379
doctor in every state not all of them

218
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:51,120
received it but the bills are dormant

219
00:10:49,379 --> 00:10:53,610
because the federal government made it

220
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,950
so difficult horrendous for the doctors

221
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:59,690
to you so what I understand to of people

222
00:10:55,950 --> 00:11:01,550
who have glaucoma and are applying right

223
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:03,410
the hemp for

224
00:11:01,549 --> 00:11:05,059
paramedic absolutely from what I

225
00:11:03,409 --> 00:11:07,759
understand the paperwork takes anywhere

226
00:11:05,059 --> 00:11:11,619
from a year to two years yeah it's

227
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:14,600
horrendous and the Mars project is

228
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:17,720
attempting to they have cut it down

229
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:20,089
until a doctor can do it in in about 50

230
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:23,660
minutes now for I understand you also

231
00:11:20,089 --> 00:11:26,209
testified before the DEA in 1988 I did

232
00:11:23,659 --> 00:11:28,278
indeed and now what came from that who

233
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:31,489
did you speak with when you are I

234
00:11:28,278 --> 00:11:35,240
justified in front of a judge Francis

235
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:37,220
young very intelligent man and the

236
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:42,528
feeling of the people that I was working

237
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:45,470
with normal and that that it was he was

238
00:11:42,528 --> 00:11:47,389
going to brush it off we were going to

239
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:49,459
finish our testimony in 15 minutes later

240
00:11:47,389 --> 00:11:53,059
he was going to say forget it he didn't

241
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:57,319
do that he agonized over this for a long

242
00:11:53,059 --> 00:12:00,708
time and his to see he was only to make

243
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:03,260
a recommendation to the head of DEA he

244
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:07,250
couldn't make the decision and he

245
00:12:03,259 --> 00:12:09,139
recommended whole heartedly and he had

246
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:10,850
heard people all over the United States

247
00:12:09,139 --> 00:12:15,379
from all different kinds of illnesses

248
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:17,600
and said in effect for God's sakes help

249
00:12:15,379 --> 00:12:20,629
these people and what kind of response

250
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:23,870
that he received they had a DEA in

251
00:12:20,629 --> 00:12:27,828
effect said drop dead why do you think

252
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:30,230
that is because they're stupid okay now

253
00:12:27,828 --> 00:12:32,509
I you only have a couple of minutes left

254
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:34,879
and I was wondering you commented that

255
00:12:32,509 --> 00:12:37,700
people of an older generation than what

256
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:40,458
I am have a problem at times being able

257
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:42,709
to rethink restructure their thinking on

258
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:47,269
this plant what do you have to say to

259
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:50,028
that okay we were told and I came from

260
00:12:47,269 --> 00:12:53,750
an era that if somebody if my government

261
00:12:50,028 --> 00:12:55,879
told me go out instead in the middle of

262
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:57,559
the traffic I'd probably do it because

263
00:12:55,879 --> 00:13:00,620
they would never tell me anything that

264
00:12:57,559 --> 00:13:04,338
was harmful and it has taken me a long

265
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:06,528
time to realize this isn't this is no

266
00:13:04,339 --> 00:13:12,140
longer true maybe it never was but I

267
00:13:06,528 --> 00:13:15,679
thought it was and so therefore it's

268
00:13:12,139 --> 00:13:18,230
difficult you you you just

269
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:19,759
it's like a religion you may go away

270
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:23,170
from the religion that you were brought

271
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:28,549
up as a child but it's always there and

272
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:31,519
I'm not sure that I would ever be able

273
00:13:28,549 --> 00:13:33,829
to smoke a marijuana cigarette okay now

274
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:36,169
you've talked about Mars and there's

275
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:37,520
probably a variety of people who are

276
00:13:36,169 --> 00:13:39,949
watching this show who'd like to have

277
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:42,169
the chance to find out more about your

278
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:44,540
organization or the organization Mars

279

it's got address and phone number I

280
00:13:44,539 --> 00:13:52,159

285
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:05,180
times has an ad in it there are many

286
