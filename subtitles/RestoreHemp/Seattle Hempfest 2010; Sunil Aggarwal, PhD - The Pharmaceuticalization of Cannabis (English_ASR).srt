1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:05,759
all we talk about race and you know that

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,160
African-Americans and Hispanics get

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:10,638
arrested more than than Caucasians and

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,080
all classes of drug rated arrests they

5
00:00:10,638 --> 00:00:14,718
get sent to jail more they get

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:17,198
prosecuted more and it's totally totally

7
00:00:14,718 --> 00:00:19,358
unfair and does not represent race

8
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:21,840
characterizations in America but what's

9
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:25,080
even more subtle underlying this is

10
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:27,359
privilege some people are allowed to use

11
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:29,439
cannabis and some people are not that's

12
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,800
all plain and simple it is it's freaking

13
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:34,480
a privilege game and I'm telling you all

14
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,320
right now that if the people don't

15
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:38,599
figure this stuff out get cannabis back

16
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,878
in their hands there is something coming

17
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:43,520
down the pathway and that's called

18
00:00:40,878 --> 00:00:46,558
pharmaceuticalization

19
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,160
okay this is what's going on there is a

20
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:50,238
company in England that is making a

21
00:00:49,159 --> 00:00:53,038
cannabis

22
00:00:50,238 --> 00:00:56,238
spray okay they are taking cannabis

23
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:58,558
plants growing them up and dissolving

24
00:00:56,238 --> 00:01:00,839
them in liquid carbon dioxide okay you

25
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:02,878
take dry ice you put a COR on it and

26
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,838
after a while you get a little mixture

27
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:07,879
and you can dissolve cannabis in that

28
00:01:04,838 --> 00:01:09,560
mixture it's been done since the 1800s

29
00:01:07,879 --> 00:01:11,280
okay but these guys have figured out a

30
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:13,519
way to nicely cleanly do it with chopped

31
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:17,719
up cannabis that they got from Dutch

32
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:20,399
from the Dutch seed banks okay heard and

33
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:22,359
then and then what happened eventually

34
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,000
these guys were able to make a mixture

35
00:01:22,359 --> 00:01:27,159
of one strain with a high TC content and

36
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,319
one strain with a high CBD content these

37
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:31,960
strains are you can find these in in us

38
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:34,398
and and a bunch of States then they went

39
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:38,199
to the international naming board and

40
00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:41,439
said this is not Ash oil this is not

41
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:44,040
marijuana this is

42
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:46,438
nimals this is a total extraction in

43
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,840
liquid carbon dioxide straight up from

44
00:01:46,438 --> 00:01:50,718
straight ganja that they've mixed up

45
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:54,040
together in one:1 ratio and they're

46
00:01:50,718 --> 00:01:55,879
calling it naxals they are allowed to

47
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,399
import this into the country it's

48
00:01:55,879 --> 00:01:59,478
straight up from Cannabis and they're

49
00:01:57,399 --> 00:02:01,118
using it in clinical trials which is

50
00:01:59,478 --> 00:02:02,438
great it's medicine for patients in

51
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:04,280
hospitals but you know what they're

52
00:02:02,438 --> 00:02:07,239
telling the government they're saying

53
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:09,840
look when you approve our spray leave

54
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:12,079
cannabis in schedule one but take our

55
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:15,439
cannabis extraction out of schedule one

56
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:19,360
so we can make Buu dollars so we do not

57
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:22,120
have to uh wait for um you know compete

58
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,560
with other Growers so I'm I mean I'm

59
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,280
just telling you this is coming down the

60
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:27,039
pike it's really crazy it's a crazy

61
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:30,280
world of privilege that's pharmaceutical

62
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:33,280
privilege over the people's right to cul

63
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:35,080
their own medicine if it's not if you

64
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,878
guys don't know about this if if you

65
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:39,120
want to if you want to know part of

66
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:41,679
what's the politics please pay attention

67
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,920
to this because before you know it um

68
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,719
you know a pharmaceutical company will

69
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:47,079
have that in your Bartell so you can get

70
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:48,878
it prescribed it'll be coming down this

71
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:51,800
is this is happening under the Obama

72
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:54,479
Administration and uh Obama himself he

73
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:56,560
has appointed the major person who was

74
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:59,119
responsible for raiding all the cannabis

75
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:02,239
dispensaries in California as to be the

76
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,879
head head of the drug enforcement agency

77
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:05,360
so you know that's the kind of stuff if

78
00:03:03,878 --> 00:03:07,239
you guys want to keep seeing those kind

79
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,720
of like repressive politics which keeps

80
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:12,360
lots of people down keeps the keeps the

81
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:14,598
privilege politics going and don't do

82
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,480
anything about it just kind of keep keep

83
00:03:14,598 --> 00:03:17,878
your little Zone but if you want to see

84
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:19,598
a change if you want people to have

85
00:03:17,878 --> 00:03:22,280
access to this thing and you I'm sure

86
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:24,839
you all do because like everybody wants

87
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:26,519
people to share the the benefits of

88
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:29,239
Mother Earth I mean this is what this is

89
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:31,480
it's 37 million year old plan so anyway

90
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:33,200
I wanted to share that with you I want

91
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:35,158
you guys to be very excited that you're

92
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:36,839
in a place like Seattle which allows

93
00:03:35,158 --> 00:03:38,878
100,000 people to come together like

94
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,438
this I mean this is pretty amazing

95
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:42,399
nowhere else in the world has this

96
00:03:40,438 --> 00:03:44,799
happen but you know it cannot be just

97
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,120
once a day once a year it has to be all

98
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,239
the time okay you can't just go to one

99
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,519
place and feel like you can be

100
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:53,158
comfortable on cannabis anywhere in the

101
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:55,239
world it should be a cannabis free zone

102
00:03:53,158 --> 00:03:58,158
a Zone that's cannabis can freely be

103
00:03:55,239 --> 00:04:00,200
talked about consumed if appropriate and

104
00:03:58,158 --> 00:04:02,280
just you know part of our lands like

105
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:04,078
it's been forever so that's what I

106
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:07,759
that's what I hope to see and any I'll

107
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:07,760
be back with you all next year
