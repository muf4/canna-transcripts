Canada's common sense we're gonna

20
00:00:54,659 --> 00:00:59,698
discuss the current state of medical

21
00:00:57,689 --> 00:01:02,339
marijuana here in Oregon and in the

22
00:00:59,698 --> 00:01:05,069
country because it is this is the

23
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:07,790
cutting edge right now with cannabis and

24
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:10,109
with him it is medical use this is where

25
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:13,110
research or at least compliation of

26
00:01:10,109 --> 00:01:15,030
reports are being done nationwide and a

27
00:01:13,109 --> 00:01:18,118
lot of you're right here in Oregon and

28
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:20,430
so what are we what do we what is the

29
00:01:18,118 --> 00:01:23,959
actual state right now about the Rebekah

30
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:27,560
medical marijuana here in Oregon well

31
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:30,780
what's going on right now is that a

32
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:34,019
person who wants to use medical

33
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:38,129
marijuana in other words has a disease

34
00:01:34,019 --> 00:01:44,269
process which includes wasting disease

35
00:01:38,129 --> 00:01:47,969
of AIDS multiple sclerosis glaucoma and

36
00:01:44,269 --> 00:01:54,319
some people even use it for various and

37
00:01:47,969 --> 00:01:59,549
sundry types of problems and there is

38
00:01:54,319 --> 00:02:02,309
virtually Enrique in particular in

39
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:03,300
regard to pain pain is so subjective

40
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:06,629
that there's

41
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:08,609
no way for somebody to measure the

42
00:02:06,629 --> 00:02:10,829
degree of pain of the intensity of pain

43
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:12,360
or even the relief of pain or anything

44
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:15,960
else they're just they're just no way to

45
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:18,540
do this but if a person says I have a

46
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:23,640
bad back or I have a bad dis or bad that

47
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:27,509
I'm in pain and that smoking marijuana

48
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:29,879
helps I I don't think that anybody

49
00:02:27,509 --> 00:02:32,009
should deny them the right to use that

50
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:36,629
now what's going on in Oregon at the

51
00:02:32,009 --> 00:02:38,609
present time is that people who are

52
00:02:36,629 --> 00:02:42,449
using marijuana for medical purposes

53
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:46,430
have to get some sort of a letter from a

54
00:02:42,449 --> 00:02:50,849
physician which says marijuana will

55
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:54,090
alleviate the problem pain or whatever

56
00:02:50,849 --> 00:02:58,979
it might be for this individual this

57
00:02:54,090 --> 00:03:00,629
letter is sent to the Oregon Health

58
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:06,719
Division

59
00:03:00,629 --> 00:03:11,489
dr. grant higgenson is the person who is

60
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:13,080
the I guess he's not the director of the

61
00:03:11,489 --> 00:03:16,409
Rd Health Division but he's a number two

62
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:19,160
person there and and the number one

63
00:03:16,409 --> 00:03:22,709
person is not a physician but he is so

64
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:25,439
he is the one who to whom these letters

65
00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:28,080
are addressed and he is the one who will

66
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:31,319
issue the equivalent of a marijuana

67
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,630
users license now the strongest thing

68
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:34,409
about it is that it is still a federal

69
00:03:33,629 --> 00:03:37,829
offense

70
00:03:34,409 --> 00:03:41,400
- in many respects about the use of

71
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:42,840
marijuana so you know at the present

72
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:46,340
time nobody knows what's going to happen

73
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:48,840
but this hasn't prevented people who get

74
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:52,050
benefit from the use of marijuana from

75
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:53,520
using it there are an estimated 200,000

76
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:55,530
people in the United States right now

77
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:58,800
who admit to using it for medical

78
00:03:55,530 --> 00:04:00,959
purposes and there are probably as I

79
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:05,120
understand it around 10 people 10

80
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:10,050
billion people excuse me who use

81
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:12,939
marijuana recreationally now this is I

82
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:14,650
think the so-called recreational

83
00:04:12,939 --> 00:04:17,980
use of this is a kind of a port term

84
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:22,509
because I don't think people smoke

85
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:25,030
tobacco for recreational purposes III I

86
00:04:22,509 --> 00:04:27,459
don't I don't know why people smoke

87
00:04:25,029 --> 00:04:29,519
tobacco but whether it's for

88
00:04:27,459 --> 00:04:33,489
recreational purposes or whatever it is

89
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:38,019
this is a sort of a strange terminology

90
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:40,180
that that is used so like when they use

91
00:04:38,019 --> 00:04:42,430
alcohol that's social drinking or

92
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:44,650
something well I suppose that that's

93
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:47,400
that's truly I've never heard of the

94
00:04:44,649 --> 00:04:50,799
social well they still use it alcohol

95
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:53,709
use of alcohol in the social use of

96
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:57,520
marijuana so the the the terminology

97
00:04:53,709 --> 00:04:59,370
here is very very obscure or muddied or

98
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:02,139
whatever the right word is imprecise

99
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:04,990
absolutely now I think one of the

100
00:05:02,139 --> 00:05:08,769
strangest things about this is that the

101
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:09,610
federal government raises marijuana in

102
00:05:08,769 --> 00:05:13,180
Mississippi

103
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:17,259
the federal government has it harvested

104
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:20,410
and processed to make marijuana

105
00:05:17,259 --> 00:05:23,860
cigarettes and there are eight people in

106
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:26,740
the United States who have letters of

107
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:30,370
permission from the Drug Enforcement

108
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:32,100
Administration to use marijuana for

109
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:36,629
their medical purposes

110
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:40,060
now if eight people can use it for

111
00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:43,719
medical purposes for relief of their

112
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:47,500
medical problem why can't nine or ten or

113
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:53,380
a thousand so it's it's a very very

114
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:56,949
strange situation and a year and a half

115
00:05:53,379 --> 00:06:00,250
ago I was one of six doctors who

116
00:05:56,949 --> 00:06:08,229
testified at the American Medical

117
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:12,339
Association convention for for the

118
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:15,520
American Medical Association to stand

119
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:18,459
behind the rights of patients to use

120
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:20,199
marijuana for medical purposes and this

121
00:06:18,459 --> 00:06:22,069
was passed by the House of Delegates

122
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:27,620
of the American Medical Association

123
00:06:22,069 --> 00:06:31,490
in Dallas the headquarters of the

124
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:33,199
American Medical Association has I don't

125
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:35,660
know whether the word is they've sat on

126
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:37,370
their hands or sat on their heads or

127
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:38,540
whatever they have done but they haven't

128
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:45,139
done anything about it

129
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:46,910
and we six doctors have written a letter

130
00:06:45,139 --> 00:06:51,050
to the Journal of the American Medical

131
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:54,050
Association as the equivalent of a

132
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:57,860
letter to the editor asking why hasn't

133
00:06:54,050 --> 00:07:00,800
the American Medical Association taken a

134
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:04,370
stand on this well the first letter we

135
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:06,199
wrote they sent back that we're sorry

136
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:08,870
but we're rejecting it because we have

137
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:11,659
too many other things to practice 'men

138
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:16,490
magazine or something like that and then

139
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:18,410
about six weeks ago the American what is

140
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:20,540
it the Institute of Medicine Institute

141
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:22,790
of Medicine Institute of Medicine and

142
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:27,140
science from the National Academy of

143
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:30,470
Science came out very highly publicized

144
00:07:27,139 --> 00:07:33,199
throughout the United States that there

145
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:36,050
was considerable evidence that marijuana

146
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:41,209
was good for certain medical medical

147
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:43,129
problems and the American Medical

148
00:07:41,209 --> 00:07:47,359
Association has been strangely quiet

149
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:51,740
about this but in view of the Institute

150
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:53,569
of Medicine we six doctors again wrote a

151
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:55,519
letter to the American Medical

152
00:07:53,569 --> 00:07:59,269
Association and the Journal of the

153
00:07:55,519 --> 00:08:01,519
American Medical Association say the

154
00:07:59,269 --> 00:08:04,339
Institute of Medicine says that it has

155
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:07,219
some benefit in medical purposes and why

156
00:08:04,339 --> 00:08:09,409
should why should people who use it be

157
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:10,160
thrown in jail for using it for medical

158
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:14,600
reasons

159
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:17,270
so as somebody pointed out a few minutes

160
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:23,629
ago we are at the cutting edge edge of

161
00:08:17,269 --> 00:08:26,120
this and with the vote I guess the last

162
00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:28,670
two elections we had for medical for use

163
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:29,810
of medical marijuana November of 98 here

164
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:34,190
in Oregon yep

165
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:36,139
and Washington and Arizona Arizona they

166
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:40,550
voted on it for the second time you know

167
00:08:36,139 --> 00:08:42,908
they originally voted in 1996 along with

168
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:45,769
California to legalize medical marijuana

169
00:08:42,908 --> 00:08:48,679
and I think I think if I understand

170
00:08:45,769 --> 00:08:52,009
right there are six states who have

171
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:55,669
passed initiatives is that what it is or

172
00:08:52,009 --> 00:08:58,069
yes six and then that's not counting the

173
00:08:55,669 --> 00:09:00,169
District of Columbia of where the United

174
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:02,300
States federal Congress has not allowed

175
00:09:00,169 --> 00:09:06,979
that vote to be counted exit polls

176
00:09:02,299 --> 00:09:09,259
showed that it passed with 72% but an

177
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:15,019
amendment to an appropriations rider by

178
00:09:09,259 --> 00:09:17,838
Georgia representative Bob Barr defunded

179
00:09:15,019 --> 00:09:20,329
the counting of that vote and said that

180
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:22,790
the District of Columbia cannot count

181
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:25,400
the vote on medical marijuana that was

182
00:09:22,789 --> 00:09:27,679
on their ballot well they couldn't count

183
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:30,079
they were accurate the federal

184
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:32,059
government basically is the treasurer

185
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,770
for the District Columbia to handle our

186
00:09:32,059 --> 00:09:37,219
money and they said they can't spend any

187
00:09:33,769 --> 00:09:38,899
money on it and so that's you know now

188
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:40,490
they've figured out that you know since

189
00:09:38,899 --> 00:09:42,860
the machines already automatically

190
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:45,100
tabulated that it would take about a

191
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:47,269
dollar and 67 cents

192
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:48,980
public money well that's for them to

193
00:09:47,269 --> 00:09:50,480
count it because it's already counted

194
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:52,570
the rest of the ballot so that's what

195
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,740
the proponents of us saying so

196
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:56,720
detractors the BOK are folks of the

197
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:58,519
world they're saying would actually cost

198
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,860
more like ten thousand dollars uh-huh

199
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:02,870
there's a whole computer run and time

200
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:04,490
and all that kind of stuff so somewhere

201
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:06,200
in between part of the real number but

202
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:08,089
our kind of thing could be further grow

203
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:10,280
and and doesn't matter anyway because

204
00:10:08,089 --> 00:10:12,950
the people should be able to have their

205
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:15,259
voice heard especially in DC which is

206
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:17,060
you know that the capital of the you

207
00:10:15,259 --> 00:10:19,069
know of the world these days supposedly

208
00:10:17,059 --> 00:10:20,269
you know in the free world the free

209
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:22,370
world now I'm you know promoting

210
00:10:20,269 --> 00:10:25,370
democracy everywhere which except from

211
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:27,019
their own backyard and which is which is

212
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:29,810
quite sad so if you're out there

213
00:10:27,019 --> 00:10:32,299
function and you believe in democracy I

214
00:10:29,809 --> 00:10:34,219
would say you know right - Bob Barr you

215
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:36,088
know so many email saying hey what are

216
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:38,249
you doing

217
00:10:36,089 --> 00:10:40,740
deny democracy to people United States

218
00:10:38,249 --> 00:10:43,680
he cannot treat treat DC like a couple

219
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:46,649
of foreign colleague Senator Bob Barr

220
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:49,769
senator you know our other senators you

221
00:10:46,649 --> 00:10:51,299
know and send our representatives most

222
00:10:49,769 --> 00:10:52,470
of them to sit at her hands because they

223
00:10:51,299 --> 00:10:55,409
know they'll have to do anything people

224
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:57,028
don't demand from them that's

225
00:10:55,409 --> 00:11:00,318
interesting that's kind of is a good

226
00:10:57,028 --> 00:11:02,058
segue into this article that our

227
00:11:00,318 --> 00:11:06,389
director Lanny

228
00:11:02,058 --> 00:11:09,049
Swerdlow sent to our representative here

229
00:11:06,389 --> 00:11:12,749
in the third District in Oregon were

230
00:11:09,049 --> 00:11:15,409
representative Earl bloom an hour Lanny

231
00:11:12,749 --> 00:11:19,199
sent him a letter urging him to support

232
00:11:15,409 --> 00:11:23,308
Barney Frank's bill House bill 912 for

233
00:11:19,198 --> 00:11:26,789
medical marijuana and he got a letter

234
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:28,708
back from Earl bloom an hour where bloom

235
00:11:26,789 --> 00:11:32,099
an hour doesn't really acknowledge that

236
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:34,229
Lanny asked about House bill 912 at all

237
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:37,790
he also doesn't acknowledge that we

238
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:41,308
voted on it here in Oregon what I read

239
00:11:37,789 --> 00:11:43,498
representative blooming hours letter in

240
00:11:41,308 --> 00:11:46,980
its entirety and then we can dissect it

241
00:11:43,499 --> 00:11:47,759
it says dear mr. swert of course it's

242
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:50,670
named Swerdlow

243
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:52,438
but dear mister swert thank you for

244
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:54,509
writing me concerning the legalization

245
00:11:52,438 --> 00:11:54,990
of marijuana and other drugs for medical

246
00:11:54,509 --> 00:11:57,269
use

247
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:59,970
I appreciate you contacting me about

248
00:11:57,269 --> 00:12:01,528
this sensitive issue recently California

249
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:03,178
voters passed a ballot initiative that's

250
00:12:01,528 --> 00:12:06,058
designed to ease restrictions on medical

251
00:12:03,178 --> 00:12:07,799
use of marijuana Arizona voters approved

252
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:10,740
a similar initiative but also relaxed

253
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:14,308
controls on heroin LSD and metha and

254
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:15,600
feta means is what Luminara says both of

255
00:12:14,308 --> 00:12:17,039
these initiatives are at odds with

256
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,230
existing federal law and are posed by

257
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:21,328
the Clinton administration shortly after

258
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:24,028
these initiatives were approved White

259
00:12:21,328 --> 00:12:26,578
House drug czar general Barry R

260
00:12:24,028 --> 00:12:28,860
McCaffrey announced that the federal

261
00:12:26,578 --> 00:12:31,769
government would prosecute doctors who

262
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:33,058
prescribed illegal drugs there are many

263
00:12:31,769 --> 00:12:35,490
unanswered questions about the

264
00:12:33,058 --> 00:12:38,159
methodists medicinal uses of marijuana

265
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:41,039
and other drugs I will certainly keep

266
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:42,419
your concerns in mind should legislation

267
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:44,399
regarding this issue come before

268
00:12:42,419 --> 00:12:46,169
Congress if I can be of further

269
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,570
assistance please feel free to contact

270
00:12:46,169 --> 00:12:50,269
my office

271
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:53,810
first of all though representative bloom

272
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:56,149
an hour knows that we voted on it here

273
00:12:53,809 --> 00:12:58,639
in Oregon that doesn't matter all he

274
00:12:56,149 --> 00:13:00,199
knows about is two and a half years ago

275
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:03,799
they voted on in California and Arizona

276
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:05,870
and even though Lanny's letter opened

277
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:08,899
and closed saying please become a

278
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:11,210
sponsor of House bill 912 for medical

279
00:13:08,899 --> 00:13:13,759
marijuana bloom in our doesn't

280
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:16,550
acknowledge that and says I will keep

281
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:17,779
your concerns in mind should legislation

282
00:13:16,549 --> 00:13:20,179
regarding this issue come before

283
00:13:17,779 --> 00:13:22,429
Congress well there is legislation there

284
00:13:20,179 --> 00:13:26,389
and you asked him to be a sponsor I are

285
00:13:22,429 --> 00:13:29,059
I get upset about these things it's you

286
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:30,889
know typical of these you know limousine

287
00:13:29,059 --> 00:13:33,079
liberal Democrats that they just don't

288
00:13:30,889 --> 00:13:34,220
want to offend anybody and they want to

289
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:36,139
make sure that you know they keep

290
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:37,670
control of everything that's how they

291
00:13:36,139 --> 00:13:41,120
can make sure they don't offend folks

292
00:13:37,669 --> 00:13:42,740
who stay in office I mean it's like yeah

293
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,539
I talked about recently California

294
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:48,370
voters was like two and a half years ago

295
00:13:44,539 --> 00:13:51,169
I mean in Arizona you know it's just

296
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:54,350
it's just quite shocking that he has no

297
00:13:51,169 --> 00:13:56,360
idea well this is a form letter that his

298
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:59,269
staff composed two years ago they have

299
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:02,840
an update of it I'm not sure which is a

300
00:13:59,269 --> 00:14:04,309
dated March 29 yeah one letter though

301
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:07,399
his staff came in with two years ago

302
00:14:04,309 --> 00:14:09,469
that's the case whooping I was like god

303
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:11,659
newborn ride his bicycle he's got to get

304
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:15,230
out there and see what his staff is

305
00:14:11,659 --> 00:14:17,240
doing in his name I'd be embarrassed if

306
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:20,120
I was if this was Lance going out under

307
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:21,980
my name so early I'm sure you're not

308
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,690
watching but you are you hadn't

309
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:26,289
embarrassed

310
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:26,290
don't make us Earl

311
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:31,669
you know many unanswered questions but

312
00:14:29,629 --> 00:14:33,649
listen uses of marijuana her drugs well

313
00:14:31,669 --> 00:14:35,750
there's many unanswered questions about

314
00:14:33,649 --> 00:14:37,730
whose use of any substance out there

315
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:39,620
we're not sure every every day is an

316
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:41,720
experiment as I'm sure doctors affect

317
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:44,299
will tell us when they use medicines

318
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:45,950
it's you know every individual different

319
00:14:44,299 --> 00:14:47,359
and they're not sure everything I always

320
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:51,530
find new information about drugs we've

321
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:53,240
had for a very long time and any day the

322
00:14:51,529 --> 00:14:53,899
fact that doesn't realize or doesn't

323
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:58,210
acknowledge

324
00:14:53,899 --> 00:15:01,639
spell 911 to exist it's pretty sad but

325
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:04,009
well survived that could mean Florida

326
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:05,330
State is there every day you know we

327
00:15:04,009 --> 00:15:08,029
find out who information about drugs

328
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:09,560
have existed for a long time I mean it's

329
00:15:08,029 --> 00:15:11,629
not like the book is closed you know

330
00:15:09,559 --> 00:15:14,419
once they come out with a drug at first

331
00:15:11,629 --> 00:15:18,980
place well I think it's very interesting

332
00:15:14,419 --> 00:15:21,829
that we know from historical records

333
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:25,629
that that kena's cannabis has been used

334
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:29,810
for literally thousands of years and

335
00:15:25,629 --> 00:15:32,480
nobody has ever reported any bad effects

336
00:15:29,809 --> 00:15:36,789
from the use of it yeah and when you

337
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:40,090
compare that to tobacco or to alcohol

338
00:15:36,789 --> 00:15:43,819
there's absolutely no comparison between

339
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:46,070
between tobacco alcohol and marijuana

340
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:51,230
there just absolutely none whatsoever

341
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:53,870
and and the statement that that

342
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:58,909
marijuana is a gateway drug to heroin or

343
00:15:53,870 --> 00:16:00,590
cocaine or whatever this was verbally

344
00:15:58,909 --> 00:16:02,209
thrashed by the Institute of Medicine

345
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:06,290
that said there was no evidence

346
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:09,889
whatsoever that this was the case so I

347
00:16:06,289 --> 00:16:12,740
think I think the main thing that we're

348
00:16:09,889 --> 00:16:14,899
doing is supporting general mccafferty

349
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:17,539
and a whole bunch of DEA agents who are

350
00:16:14,899 --> 00:16:20,629
making very high salaries and don't want

351
00:16:17,539 --> 00:16:23,209
to give up the the the game is you know

352
00:16:20,629 --> 00:16:25,639
you might you might say so the people

353
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:28,910
that are making money on the marijuana

354
00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:33,549
issue are the DEA agents and the people

355
00:16:28,909 --> 00:16:38,689
who grow and sell marijuana and don't

356
00:16:33,549 --> 00:16:41,120
don't pay any taxes on any aspect of of

357
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:44,570
the money that they make and if they're

358
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:47,600
caught they get sent to a federal prison

359
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:50,780
where it costs at least $40,000 a year

360
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:53,090
to keep them in prison so I guess the

361
00:16:50,779 --> 00:16:55,669
federal prisons the guards and the

362
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:56,240
prisons are probably also recipients of

363
00:16:55,669 --> 00:16:58,009
a lot of money

364
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,049
from the marijuana business so exact

365
00:16:58,009 --> 00:17:02,929
it's really a straight strange

366
00:17:00,049 --> 00:17:06,409
absolutely bizarre situation that that

367
00:17:02,929 --> 00:17:09,289
this has gone on and I can't understand

368
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:12,890
why some of these politicians in

369
00:17:09,289 --> 00:17:14,779
Washington DC and elsewhere can't see

370
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:17,150
this or understand it or whatever the

371
00:17:14,779 --> 00:17:17,629
right word is I don't I don't understand

372
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:19,670
it either

373
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:22,790
yeah yeah I tend to think that way

374
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:23,959
that's just you know plain inertia for

375
00:17:22,789 --> 00:17:25,909
you like the vast majority of

376
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:28,250
politicians you know you have some you

377
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:30,350
know my knowing in one hand or this drug

378
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:32,299
war is out now more holistic drug

379
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:33,949
warriors and then he has a few

380
00:17:32,299 --> 00:17:36,139
politicians that say yeah I know we've

381
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:38,058
got a you know basically say let people

382
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:40,820
decide for themselves the most of them

383
00:17:38,058 --> 00:17:42,259
it's just like you know status quo they

384
00:17:40,819 --> 00:17:44,000
don't want to change anything because

385
00:17:42,259 --> 00:17:46,429
this is a system that they're used to

386
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:50,299
operating in I think if you brought in

387
00:17:46,429 --> 00:17:54,200
you know an outside economists who've

388
00:17:50,299 --> 00:17:57,460
had no exposure at all to you know that

389
00:17:54,200 --> 00:18:00,558
the drug underground substance

390
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:02,058
trade in and in this world I don't where

391
00:18:00,558 --> 00:18:04,129
you'd find such an economist but you

392
00:18:02,058 --> 00:18:05,629
know like the proverbial management

393
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:07,429
miners or something coming in and take a

394
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:10,309
look at this and they would laugh at us

395
00:18:07,429 --> 00:18:12,080
and they say well you know the way your

396
00:18:10,308 --> 00:18:14,389
system is working is supposed to work

397
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:17,089
and the way it's set up you know you

398
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:18,679
know people are opinion taxes they're

399
00:18:17,089 --> 00:18:20,569
making money and therefore it's it's a

400
00:18:18,679 --> 00:18:22,370
drain on the on the government it's a

401
00:18:20,569 --> 00:18:23,990
burden on the rest of us because we have

402
00:18:22,369 --> 00:18:26,569
to pay more taxes because those folks

403
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:29,029
aren't paying their fair share for the

404
00:18:26,569 --> 00:18:31,428
roads the bridges you know the sewer

405
00:18:29,029 --> 00:18:33,740
systems and then we have the fact that

406
00:18:31,429 --> 00:18:35,269
it's costing us money now they're paying

407
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:38,120
their fair share but causes money to

408
00:18:35,269 --> 00:18:40,759
build the building prisons to pay the

409
00:18:38,119 --> 00:18:43,459
guards to staff these prisons police to

410
00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:45,740
arrest you know the the judges what's

411
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:47,179
more courthouses they're building that's

412
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:48,620
one of the reason that though this huge

413
00:18:47,179 --> 00:18:50,929
Mark Hatfield courthouse in downtown

414
00:18:48,619 --> 00:18:52,428
Portland here fact that they're

415
00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:54,559
arresting more people for drug crimes

416
00:18:52,429 --> 00:18:56,900
you know it was just a simple you know

417
00:18:54,558 --> 00:18:58,279
interstate white-collar crime stuff we

418
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:02,050
all probably need like one or two judges

419
00:18:58,279 --> 00:19:03,619
you know and and you just it's just

420
00:19:02,049 --> 00:19:05,079
something that I think an outside

421
00:19:03,619 --> 00:19:07,149
observer would look at they were just

422
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:10,470
at your head and say well what were you

423
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:14,560
guys thinking of you know I think that

424
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:17,259
given the end of prohibition we're going

425
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:19,720
to look back on the outline of marijuana

426
00:19:17,259 --> 00:19:23,200
much the way that we currently look back

427
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:25,569
on civil rights legislation in the Jim

428
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:32,490
Crow laws we look at the Jim Crow laws

429
00:19:25,569 --> 00:19:39,099
that kept people on European Americans

430
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:41,109
in a subordinate State and we look at

431
00:19:39,099 --> 00:19:43,240
that and think that was wrong those laws

432
00:19:41,109 --> 00:19:45,819
were wrong and that that was the you

433
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:46,930
know we're glad that that's over well

434
00:19:45,819 --> 00:19:49,269
we're going to look back on these

435
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:52,420
marijuana laws and do the exact same

436
00:19:49,269 --> 00:19:54,609
thing and and I think that you know we

437
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:58,750
want to urge our viewers out there to

438
00:19:54,609 --> 00:20:02,799
help us lead ourselves and our state out

439
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:06,369
of this morass that phone number is two

440
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:09,579
three five four six zero six that's two

441
00:20:06,369 --> 00:20:12,189
three five four six zero six we have the

442
00:20:09,579 --> 00:20:14,529
Oregon cannabis Tax Act petition

443
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:16,150
currently in circulation would you like

444
00:20:14,529 --> 00:20:18,549
to tell them what the Oregon cannabis

445
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:21,300
Tax Act well the whammer's tax said it

446
00:20:18,549 --> 00:20:25,389
will tax and regulate the sales of

447
00:20:21,299 --> 00:20:26,950
cannabis to adults through state stores

448
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:28,720
which are be operated like to take

449
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:32,049
liquor stores would you go and buy

450
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:34,809
liquor in or bars for that matter to

451
00:20:32,049 --> 00:20:40,000
adults over the age of 21 it'll also

452
00:20:34,809 --> 00:20:43,929
allow patients to get marijuana at at

453
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:46,240
cost in pharmacies you can go into a

454
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:47,410
pharmacy by that cost and they're you

455
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,359
know and then doctor who they'll

456
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:51,100
prescribe it instead of this having to

457
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:53,019
grow your own or getting a caregiver to

458
00:20:51,099 --> 00:20:54,789
grow it for you and what if you have

459
00:20:53,019 --> 00:20:57,460
brown thumbs that would green thumb and

460
00:20:54,789 --> 00:20:59,619
we're also allowing our farmers to grow

461
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:01,150
that dust really hemp so we can you know

462
00:20:59,619 --> 00:21:04,629
compete with the rest world industrial

463
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:06,280
hemp so that's industrial have medicinal

464
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:09,600
marijuana available at cost at

465
00:21:06,279 --> 00:21:13,240
pharmacies and allow adults to purchase

466
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:15,889
in state operates stores for

467
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:19,099
recreational purposes with the

468
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:20,600
seeds going to the taxes on face we've

469
00:21:19,099 --> 00:21:22,399
been going to the state government to

470
00:21:20,599 --> 00:21:25,609
funding whether state government decides

471
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:27,680
to fund we decided we put 90 percent of

472
00:21:25,609 --> 00:21:29,569
the proceeds and we expect there's gonna

473
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:31,220
be a lot of money generated by this we

474
00:21:29,569 --> 00:21:33,829
can't really say what the amount will be

475
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:37,130
right now but let's leave that aside

476
00:21:33,829 --> 00:21:39,049
look we did we denote that ninety

477
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:40,760
percent goes into the state general fund

478
00:21:39,049 --> 00:21:42,589
so it'll be up to the legislature to

479
00:21:40,759 --> 00:21:44,809
decide how to spend it hopefully they'll

480
00:21:42,589 --> 00:21:46,879
put it into education but there'll be a

481
00:21:44,809 --> 00:21:48,909
lot less need for prisons in courts so

482
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:51,110
they won't be putting it there hopefully

483
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:54,920
the other of the remaining ten percent

484
00:21:51,109 --> 00:21:56,599
eight percent goes to fund drug abuse

485
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:59,300
treatment programs for people with

486
00:21:56,599 --> 00:22:02,119
alcoholic and other substance abuse

487
00:21:59,299 --> 00:22:04,210
problems and then one percent would go

488
00:22:02,119 --> 00:22:07,250
to a comprehensive drug education

489
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:09,559
program for kids in schools to teach

490
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:11,299
them about the dangers that substance

491
00:22:09,559 --> 00:22:14,389
abuse can have on their development and

492
00:22:11,299 --> 00:22:16,700
finally the one final 1% goes to fund

493
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:21,080
the state agricultural committee that

494
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:25,130
will support and promote industrial hemp

495
00:22:21,079 --> 00:22:27,889
products made from fiber protein and oil

496
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:30,830
and their associated industries so and

497
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:33,770

if a person smokes marijuana they'll go

crazy and kill their family and friends

519

criminalize it one of them anyway

using the free Adobe Acrobat printer so

533
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:14,960

535
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:19,100
getting used to here to having to always

536
00:24:16,819 --> 00:24:24,649
give the area code from now on that's

537
00:24:19,099 --> 00:24:26,929
true so 503 235 for 606 now doctor the

538
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:30,620
vet I want to ask you that's one thing

539
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:32,660
that I've heard some doctors say is

540
00:24:30,619 --> 00:24:35,059
about whether or not marijuana that it

541
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:37,190
can causes a depression what people try

542
00:24:35,059 --> 00:24:38,899
to get off of marijuana you know enjoy

543
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:41,900
everything about that nothing about that

544
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:43,490
I I know a lot of people who who smoke

545
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:48,019
marijuana and I have never heard that

546
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:50,420
said okay well we have folks for the

547
00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:52,129
record he's a professor of pharmacology

548
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:54,529
and toxicology so I don't think you'll

549
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:58,250
find many people more qualified to make

550
00:24:54,529 --> 00:25:01,039
a statement I said I think excuse me but

551
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:05,029
I I think I think the CIM the comparison

552
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:06,440
might be easy to make about what happens

553
00:25:05,029 --> 00:25:07,799
when somebody tries to quit smoking

554
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:10,150
tobacco

555
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:13,970
[Laughter]

556
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:15,830
there's the patch in the chewing gum and

557
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:18,200
the the pills and all of those things

558
00:25:15,829 --> 00:25:20,659
they can take to quit smoking tobacco I

559
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:22,340
guess for folks that have problems

560
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:23,810
there's also groups called marijuana

561
00:25:22,339 --> 00:25:25,699
Anonymous out there

562
00:25:23,809 --> 00:25:28,039
they aren't used by many people but if

563
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:29,720
you'd like to quit smoking marijuana we

564
00:25:28,039 --> 00:25:32,329
recommend that you contact marijuana

565

566
00:25:32,329 --> 00:25:35,699

567
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:37,288
talk to somebody about it I mean you

568
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:40,169
know we don't believe in substance abuse

569
00:25:37,288 --> 00:25:43,019
we believe in adults to choose choosing

570
00:25:40,169 --> 00:25:46,288
