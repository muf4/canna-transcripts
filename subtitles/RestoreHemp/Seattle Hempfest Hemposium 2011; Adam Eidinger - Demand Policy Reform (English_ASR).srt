1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,259
I just want to thank everyone who stuck

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,209
around for our presentation here it

3
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:09,059
means a lot to come out all the way from

4
00:00:06,209 --> 00:00:10,440
Washington DC and speak to all the

5
00:00:09,058 --> 00:00:11,968
hipsters here everybody here as a

6
00:00:10,439 --> 00:00:14,548
hamster who came to seattle hempfest

7
00:00:11,968 --> 00:00:15,838
this year you don't have to be working

8
00:00:14,548 --> 00:00:17,579
twenty-four/seven in the hemp industry

9
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,160
to be a hemisphere you can just you can

10
00:00:17,579 --> 00:00:22,829
become a member of vote hemp and the hip

11
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,329
industry association as a supporter you

12
00:00:22,829 --> 00:00:25,799
don't have to be in the industry so we

13
00:00:24,329 --> 00:00:27,329
and that's one of the ways the distri

14
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,460
has grown is through grassroots support

15
00:00:27,329 --> 00:00:30,868
and just I want to remind every once

16
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,160
again it's been sent a couple times but

17
00:00:30,868 --> 00:00:34,500
we I really think we are the most

18
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:36,269
powerful movement in America right now

19
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,429
we don't act like it we have to start

20
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:40,980
acting like it and demanding change at

21
00:00:38,429 --> 00:00:43,350
any politician who blows you off when it

22
00:00:40,979 --> 00:00:45,718
comes to cannabis reform you just have

23
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:48,480
to tell them I'm not going away buddy

24
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:50,910
you're going to go away if you don't act

25
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:52,589
on this issue so anyway let's keep

26
00:00:50,909 --> 00:00:55,019
fighting together and the stay united

27
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:57,390
and and thanks again for having me here

28
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:59,850
where to wisdom from Adam never ever

29
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:03,469
ever go for someone who considers you

30
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:03,469
criminal for a non-violent offense
