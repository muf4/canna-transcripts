1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:04,599
one of the important things that I feel

2
00:00:03,158 --> 00:00:06,480
uh for people to know and one of the

3
00:00:04,599 --> 00:00:08,119
main reasons that I'm doing the things

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,798
that I

5
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:14,759
do are because of Jack Jack and for

6
00:00:12,798 --> 00:00:17,160
those of you who are unaware Jack herrer

7
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:18,920
is a man that you if you've had anything

8
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,439
to do with cannabis in about the last

9
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:22,760
what 30 years or so you basically owe

10
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,480
this man a big thank you and

11
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:27,039
unfortunately he is no longer with us to

12
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,039
thank so one of the things that I wanted

13
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,240
to do at this first Hempfest in Tacoma

14
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,039
that we're uh we're going to this

15
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:32,839
afternoon is we're going to have a

16
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:35,439
moment of silence for Jacker at 420

17
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:37,960
instead of the usual Hempfest 420 moment

18
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:39,159
which uh has been surprising quite a few

19
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,320
people today when they've heard about

20
00:00:39,159 --> 00:00:41,279
that they're they're waiting to hear you

21
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,480
know how many blunts you going to be

22
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,600
thrown out and it's was like absolutely

23
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:46,919
none we're going to be dead quiet for

24
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,160
for one moment and we're all going to

25
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,679
pay attention to the people that have

26
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:53,319
been lost for this movement um Mark

27
00:00:50,679 --> 00:00:55,039
Emory is a man that's uh sitting in a

28
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:57,679
prison up 30 miles from where I stand

29
00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:00,239
right now and he's in jail actually he's

30
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:02,439
not in jail he's in a federal prison for

31
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:05,518
selling seeds this is a holdover from

32
00:01:02,439 --> 00:01:08,079
the bush era drug war it's ridiculous

33
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,840
it's ridiculous that Canada allowed a

34
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:12,079
Canadian citizen to be extradited for a

35
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,040
crime that only holds a $200 fine in his

36
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:16,840
country at worst at the absolute worst

37
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,920
he was looking at a $200 fine in his

38
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:21,520
country they extradited him and gave him

39
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:23,599
to a country a foreign country that is

40
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:26,599
almost that were trying to get him life

41
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:29,158
in prison for selling seeds to a plant

42
00:01:26,599 --> 00:01:32,000
that we all know is not harmful is not

43
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:35,680
going to hurt anybody and is not worth

44
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,200
life in prison for and U that's that's

45
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,000
one of the main main drives that I've

46
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,439
got um if if more people kind of

47
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,959
understand just how important Jack carer

48
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:44,319
was and the research that he did and

49
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:46,158
just that the awareness that he brought

50
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:47,758
to people uh one of the things that I

51
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:50,200
found I'm a 38-year old male I've been

52
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,759
using cannabis since I was 7 years old

53
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:54,560
um when I first read the emperor wears

54
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:56,359
no clothes I was 17 years old and it

55
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,439
completely changed my outlook and

56
00:01:56,359 --> 00:02:01,319
attitude on Canabis I had no idea how

57
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:03,319
much information was actually out there

58
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:05,758
and reading that book and understanding

59
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:07,199
how much research and just devotion you

60
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,038
have to have to find these things that

61
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,080
have been deceptively hidden by the

62
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:12,559
government for decades that takes some

63
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:15,080
effort and that that deserves some

64
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,479
recognition and I think that a lot of

65
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,800
the newer generation of people that are

66
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:20,238
being exposed to cannabis don't

67
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:23,319
necessarily understand how important the

68
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:25,120
people are that have gone before you

69
00:02:23,318 --> 00:02:27,119
because what they're not seeing is how

70
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,200
those people influence people like me

71
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,680
people like you people like anybody that

72
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:32,919
does this kind of thing anybody that

73
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:34,480
does the you know work for the Canabis

74
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:37,199
community at the level that I that I

75
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:38,959
feel I do they know of these guys you

76
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:40,399
know they treat up with some respect and

77
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,158
you think about the history involved you

78
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,200
know guys like Ed rosenal so there's so

79
00:02:42,158 --> 00:02:45,679
many people I couldn't name them all but

80
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:47,199
the all the Breeders that have ever come

81
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,439
up with anything that you've ever tried

82
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:50,719
that you've enjoyed or you've heard

83
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:51,759
about or heard those are the people that

84
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:53,519
you know you don't necessarily need to

85
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:55,280
be go go patting them on the back or

86
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:58,239
anything but at least give them a little

87
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,719
bit of thought instead of just you know

88
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,959
where's your next bag coming from and

89
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:02,680
what what's it going to be and you know

90
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,519
strive for some Perfection these people

91
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:06,920
gave a lot over the course of their

92
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:09,200
lives and it deserves some recognition

93
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:11,280
but this this this this testimony right

94
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:12,958
here is proof Jack that that you might

95
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:17,239
be going front us but you'll never leave

96
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,239
us bro love you Jack
