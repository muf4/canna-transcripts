1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:05,759
well I must say it's been an honor to

2
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:08,960
know Gatewood the number of years that

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:13,320
I've known him I met him back it was

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,320
Earth day and it was

5
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:18,759
1991 and we were filming segments for

6
00:00:16,278 --> 00:00:22,399
time for hemp in San

7
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:24,080
Francisco we'd gone up to San Francisco

8
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:27,518
Ed Rosenthal I wanted to be a guest on

9
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:30,239
the show and we had anticipated spending

10
00:00:27,518 --> 00:00:32,920
the day filming a big interview with Ed

11
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:36,960
and going over his library of books that

12
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:39,000
he'd written and uh about an hour before

13
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,239
I and the camber crew and the sound crew

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,359
got there Ed apparently thought it'd be

15
00:00:41,238 --> 00:00:48,399
a good time to drop two hits

16
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:51,000
acid so uh did there wasn't much to

17
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:54,000
interview at that point yeah you know so

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,399
we went down to uh Earth Day a little

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,320
early and Jack har said that a friend of

20
00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:01,120
his by the name of Gateway galberth was

21
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:03,119
going to be around we should try to make

22
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:06,158
it a point to get Gatewood on the

23
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:07,959
program as a guest and he said that

24
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:10,400
Gatewood was running for governor of

25
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:12,719
Kentucky and I said he's

26
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,560
what he said he's running for governor

27
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:18,679
of Kentucky and I said and he smokes

28
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:21,040
pot and gate was I mean and Jack Harris

29
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:23,479
said yeah and he'll make a great guess

30
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:27,560
so you should make it a point to talk

31
00:01:23,478 --> 00:01:30,438
with him well those of you who've known

32
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:32,399
me a long time may know that my family

33
00:01:30,438 --> 00:01:33,879
has a political background in the state

34
00:01:32,399 --> 00:01:38,079
of

35
00:01:33,879 --> 00:01:40,438
Indiana my mom was uh the first female

36
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:43,519
to be president of the County Council in

37
00:01:40,438 --> 00:01:45,519
our area and in the history of of

38
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:47,560
Delaware County and she broke a lot of

39
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:50,158
ground she was a woman's Liber as we

40
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:52,280
called them back then and she taught me

41
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:55,439
at an early age the importance of one

42
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:57,079
standing up for yourself and being who

43
00:01:55,438 --> 00:02:00,879
you are and true to

44
00:01:57,078 --> 00:02:04,559
yourself which gate would represented as

45
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:07,238
a candidate and she taught me

46
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,719
the ins and outs of

47
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:13,039
politics and I knew after hanging out

48
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:16,080
with Jack hair that even though he had

49
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:19,639
the truth about making paper and fiber

50
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,400
and fuel out of this fantastic plant

51
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:24,039
that unless you make a change in

52
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:26,519
Congress or you make a change in the

53
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:28,079
Senate you're not going to get a whole

54
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:31,680
lot done you're just going to be

55
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:34,879
educating people about the truth

56
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,879
and when I heard that we had somebody

57
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:38,878
from the marijuana movement running for

58
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:41,840
governor of a

59
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:45,719
state that impressed me until that point

60
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:49,840
I had known Jack hair and the

61
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:54,439
intellectual aspects of this plant of

62
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:56,560
this of the history of this entire

63
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:58,800
travesty and we had worked on the

64
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,759
California hemp initiative and I saw

65
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,840
with Jack hair how through politics you

66
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:06,039
can make a

67
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:08,840
change but the idea at that time when

68
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:11,318
Gatewood was running for

69
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:13,920
governor coming out of the closet about

70
00:03:11,318 --> 00:03:17,359
smoking marijuana and talking about

71
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:21,000
using the revenue that comes from

72
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:24,120
generating taxes from creating

73
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,280
industries that are built on making

74
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,759
fabulous products from this plant and

75
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:31,560
how we were saving the environment and

76
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:34,318
how we were saving dollars it all made

77
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:36,799
sense and suddenly not only did we have

78
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:39,958
Jack hair's

79
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:42,239
knowledge we had the sensibility of

80
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:45,158
Gatewood galberth as a

81
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:48,080
candidate now another aspect about

82
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:49,959
Gatewood unlike a lot of us in the

83
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,360
marijuana movement when I came into the

84
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:54,120
marijuana movement I came in because

85
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:55,920
Jack har needed somebody to run his

86
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,400
office while he went on the road to talk

87
00:03:55,919 --> 00:04:01,199
about paper fiber and

88
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,400
fuel Jack came into the movement because

89
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:04,958
some lady introduced it to him and he

90
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,158
wanted to smoke it and it was like

91
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:07,598
that's how you made the book about

92
00:04:06,158 --> 00:04:10,519
getting high high and this and you've

93
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:12,759
all heard that story Gatewood came into

94
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:14,400
it because his grandfather and his great

95
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:16,798
grandfather and his great great

96
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,439
grandfather and his great great great

97
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:22,120
grandfather and I think the people who

98
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:25,519
knew Jesus in your family all grew

99
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:28,840
marijuana but they didn't grow it to get

100
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:31,719
high they grew it to make oil they grew

101
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:34,359
it to make rope they grew to make papers

102
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:37,520
they grew as an industry and as they

103
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:39,639
were doing so they were making a

104
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:40,680
environment that was considered one of

105
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:42,600
the

106
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:45,800
wealthiest

107
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:49,199
commonwealths in the history of the

108
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:51,520
United States so here I had somebody

109
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:55,400
from the belly of the Beast getting

110
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:59,079
ready to sit down and talk to me for the

111
00:04:55,399 --> 00:05:00,239
first time and a very rational

112
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:01,680
intellectual

113
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:05,360
way that I've never been dealt with

114
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:08,160
before On My Level in politics My Level

115
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:13,520
meaning the voter the person who's going

116
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:16,280
to be voting in New York Kentucky

117
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:18,918
Maine somebody who works on

118
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:21,478
candidates campaigns and knows how to

119
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:23,879
put together the importance of all the

120
00:05:21,478 --> 00:05:27,000
fine points of how we get a candidate

121
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:28,680
elected and all the key reasons he

122
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,519
didn't come in here and going we want to

123
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:33,560
get high

124
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:35,478
which we do and on by the way those of

125
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:38,478
you who are very comfortable knowing

126
00:05:35,478 --> 00:05:40,519
that we've outlawed this plant because

127
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:43,000
it keeps those of us from getting

128
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:47,439
high no it just keeps you from getting

129
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,800
taxes from us getting high um Gatewood

130
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:50,959
talks

131
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,280
sensibility the interview that I did

132
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:55,560
with

133
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:57,159
Gatewood when I showed it to my parents

134
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:00,399
very conservative

135
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:02,520
Midwestern running for office my my mom

136
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:06,959
very very well known in politics on a

137
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:10,000
Statewide level very active

138
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:12,439
campaigner they were blown away their

139
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,598
comment was this man should be governor

140
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:15,839
of

141
00:06:13,598 --> 00:06:18,519
Kentucky when I got done talking with

142
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:21,598
Gatewood for the very first time it made

143
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:23,038
sense to me that he should be governor

144
00:06:21,598 --> 00:06:25,439
of any

145
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:28,079
state he was the first person who was

146
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:29,598
actually talking dollars and cents get

147
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:32,359
rid of the smoke and noise and

148
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:34,439
Industries and bring in the green

149
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:36,080
industry what do you hear now I almost

150
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:38,079
wanted to throw up in my own mouth when

151
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:40,560
I heard Al Gore stand before Congress

152
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:43,159
and talk about getting rid of the smoke

153
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:45,120
and noise industry and bringing in the

154
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:47,800
green industry and he said everything

155
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:50,800
that gate was said except for one

156
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,800
word

157
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:56,800
hemp when President Obama addressed the

158
00:06:54,120 --> 00:07:00,399
United States after this

159
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:03,079
horrific spill in the Gulf

160
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:06,719
he stood before America and

161
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:08,240
promised to set us free from foreign oil

162
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,319
that we were going to take care of the

163
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:13,879
problems that developed this mess off of

164
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:16,319
our Shores and he said everything that

165
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:19,479
Gatewood galberth has been saying for 20

166
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,479
years except for one

167
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:25,279
word

168
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:27,800
hemp I get a little agitated when I talk

169
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:30,638

travesty because people like gatew

181
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:05,840
galberth has been standing on the

182
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:09,560
corners of every street corner in this

183
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:13,239
nation saying the truth along with Jack

186
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:21,080
activist that has known the truth for 20

187
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:24,199
years so when someone like gate MC

188
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:27,598
galbert says to me he's running for

189
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:30,960
office for governor of the state of

190
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:33,240
Kentucky and it this his intention to

191
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:36,360
take this plant the revenue from this

192
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:39,519
plant and generate from IT jobs that

193
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:42,399
will benefit those people living in

194
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:45,600
Kentucky the revenue will help benefit

195
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:49,240
schools for the children going there to

196
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:51,480
get their brains fed in

197
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:53,680
Kentucky it's going to take care of the

198
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:56,399
health care problems for the senior

199
00:08:53,679 --> 00:09:00,359
citizens that are facing a federal

200
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:02,120
bankruptcy of our social security in 13

201
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:05,759
years in

202
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:07,839
Kentucky that he has a solution to the

203
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:10,278
problems in

204
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:13,480
Kentucky that will ultimately bring

205
00:09:10,278 --> 00:09:15,799
forward a solution to the problems in

206
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:21,240
America I believe

207
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:23,879
him he handed out 20 years ago a book to

208
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:26,879
everybody who would pay mind to it the

209
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:29,879
marijuana feasibility study how you

210
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:33,078
would take this plant put an end to our

211
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:35,278
economy began to take it put it into

212
00:09:33,078 --> 00:09:38,078
fuels by just changing the car a little

213
00:09:35,278 --> 00:09:40,559
bit here by putting it into the papers

214
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:43,519
and the fibers and the fuels and making

215
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:45,439
the jobs and the revenue and the taxes

216
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:47,919
and how we would stop putting the money

217
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,880
into the prison system and into the

218
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:52,759
court systems and we could save the

219
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:56,159
taxpayer and we would have a beautiful

220
00:09:52,759 --> 00:10:00,159
society that was designed to

221
00:09:56,159 --> 00:10:03,078
educate our citizens and stimulate

222
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:05,399
creativity and to bring forward an

223
00:10:03,078 --> 00:10:08,399
environment low on

224
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:12,360
crime that would not cost the

225
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:17,078
taxpayers a large amount of money I

226
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:20,120
believed him he spoke to me as a voter

227
00:10:17,078 --> 00:10:23,199
looking for solutions to horrific

228
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:25,839
problems that laid at my feet and the

229
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:28,440
feet of my

230
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:31,519
children that was the impact that I had

231
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:35,160
from Gateway G Al when he sat down and

232
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:39,440
took time for hemp now when Gatewood

233
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:42,439
took time for Casper over the years as a

234
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,440
friend

235
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,000
amazing I've had it with the planet

236
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:50,639
sometimes and I would call Gatewood up

237
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,958
and say I can't take it that the world's

238
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:58,240
beat me and I get off the phone and I

239
00:10:53,958 --> 00:11:00,799
got it I'm regenerated I'm

240
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:04,200
okay gatewood's been there when I said

241
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:06,439
Gatewood the world loves me today it's

242
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:09,519
been a good

243
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:13,040
day and as a friend we've

244
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:15,919
laughed and I know the Merit of this man

245
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:17,838
the character of this man and there

246
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:20,958
hasn't been a time that this man has let

247
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:25,480
me down as a

248
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:28,759
friend or as a citizen of my

249
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:29,759
nation the one thing I am most baffled

250
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:33,519
by

251
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:36,879
as how it is he has not been elected yet

252
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:39,320
to the seat of the governor of

253
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:41,600
Kentucky he speaks

254
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:45,839
rational he speaks

255
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:48,440
truth he speaks plain English and

256
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:51,399
anybody who's going to go and put their

257
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:55,279
vote on any candidate is looking for

258
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:58,399
someone who speaks the truth and plain

259
00:11:55,278 --> 00:12:01,200
English that's why I've never understood

260
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:05,879
how it is a man and who had the answers

261
