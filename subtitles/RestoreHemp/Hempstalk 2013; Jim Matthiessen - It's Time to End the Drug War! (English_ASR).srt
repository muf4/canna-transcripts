1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,219
you know that I just got the word they

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:07,019
got these new initiatives coming out to

3
00:00:05,219 --> 00:00:07,979
legalize marijuana in the state of

4
00:00:07,019 --> 00:00:10,199
Oregon

5
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:12,660
I think that's a good thing I think that

6
00:00:10,199 --> 00:00:14,339
all of every all of you should do that

7
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,480
and the reason I think that is because

8
00:00:14,339 --> 00:00:17,698
if you don't you know they're going to

9
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,980
legalize it anyway do you want the

10
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:22,500
legislature to legalize it for you and

11
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:25,199
make all the rules or do you want to

12
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:27,118
make the rules yourselves by legalizing

13
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,019
it yourselves so yeah that's kind of the

14
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:30,239
difference

15
00:00:28,018 --> 00:00:33,119
so you know I mean you can you know keep

16
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:34,439
keep sitting back and waiting uh but

17
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:35,879
really there's something that's got to

18
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:38,759
get done

19
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:41,040
and uh you know we don't want to be uh

20
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:43,259
you know late on the history of this

21
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:45,058
thing Oregon's right in the middle you

22
00:00:43,259 --> 00:00:47,460
know California and Oregon are the next

23
00:00:45,058 --> 00:00:50,218
states to legalize I do believe

24
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:51,539
and it's time for us to do that so if

25
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:53,399
you're looking back right across from

26
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:55,379
the main stage here there's the THC

27
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:57,899
Clinic back there there's a it's what

28
00:00:55,378 --> 00:01:00,119
where where is it let's see RH right

29
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:01,920
there okay all right right over here is

30
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:02,939
the paperwork on this new initiative

31
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,978
stuff

32
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:07,739
you know and if you want to register to

33
00:01:04,978 --> 00:01:09,658
vote as I think you ought to I'm not

34
00:01:07,739 --> 00:01:11,759
asking you to vote for president or none

35
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:13,979
of that but uh you know you can't

36
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,659
control your neighborhood and the way

37
00:01:13,978 --> 00:01:17,159
you do it is that you control the your

38
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:19,920
neighborhood through your boat locally

39
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:22,020
so the initiative process is that's how

40
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,939
we're doing it that's how it happened in

41
00:01:22,019 --> 00:01:25,978
Washington that's how it happens in

42
00:01:23,938 --> 00:01:28,500
Colorado that's how it's going to happen

43
00:01:25,978 --> 00:01:30,959
right here but really you know we got to

44
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:33,060
get involved you know and and there's a

45
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:35,039
reason for it there's too many people in

46
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:37,200
prison there's too many people in jail

47
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,540
you know because that's what's morally

48
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,340
wrong about the whole thing you know I'd

49
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:43,320
like to yeah maybe I'd like to sit back

50
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:45,420
and make all kind of money uh selling an

51
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:47,279
herb or something but that isn't the way

52
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,780
it works you know the way it works is

53
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,540
that we got a bunch of people in prison

54
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:54,478
for thinking that way

55
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:56,340
and it's time for the thing to change we

56
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:59,700
need to get the bars opened up let

57
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:01,618
everybody out of there because uh you

58
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:04,560
know that we do need jail we need it for

59
00:02:01,618 --> 00:02:07,379
criminals you know rapist murderers

60
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,118
thieves you know they're out there and

61
00:02:07,379 --> 00:02:10,978
that's enough to keep the cops busy

62
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:13,500
right there see they don't need to be

63
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:16,379
chasing us they don't need to be chasing

64
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,639
you so all you use especially man hear

65
00:02:16,378 --> 00:02:21,598
my message

66
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:23,519
you know Step Up register to vote and

67
00:02:21,598 --> 00:02:26,219
change our local rules a little bit by

68
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,560
legalizing marijuana in Oregon we say

69
00:02:26,219 --> 00:02:31,259
there's more than one thing there's also

70
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,759
a constitutional amendment

71
00:02:31,259 --> 00:02:34,439
you see there's a couple of different

72
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:36,419
things going on right now you got to

73
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:38,459
look at that you can vote on that

74
00:02:36,419 --> 00:02:40,139
you know a constitutional amendment that

75
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:41,759
uh

76
00:02:40,139 --> 00:02:43,199
means that nobody's going to go to jail

77
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:45,679
for this anymore and I think it's an

78
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:45,679
important thing
