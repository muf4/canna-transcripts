1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,720
Kentucky was the world's largest

2
00:00:02,279 --> 00:00:06,959
producer f for over 100 years it was our

3
00:00:04,719 --> 00:00:10,759
largest cash crop for for more than a

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:14,519
century and and uh imagine that a state

5
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:16,560
whose largest cash crop was hemp and uh

6
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:20,118
I'm sure that the the smoking aspect of

7
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:23,320
it was uh you know was also well

8
00:00:20,118 --> 00:00:27,678
represented um people

9
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:30,039
um of course in the early 1900s it uh

10
00:00:27,678 --> 00:00:32,399
went down and they legalized it in 37

11
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:35,840
and

12
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:38,160
um Kentucky should be the place where

13
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,280
cannabis is returned as a cash crop in

14
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:42,199
the state of Kentucky and I started out

15
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:44,640
a long time ago to try to make that a

16
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:47,120
reality uh I'm a fourth generation

17
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,558
Kentuckian uh I was 24 years old in a

18
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:51,479
milk man in

19
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:54,399
1971 when I decided I was Grist for the

20
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:57,078
mill I was end up in prison or in in

21
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:59,399
jail or dead at an early age so I

22
00:00:57,079 --> 00:01:00,518
decided that uh I better learn the

23
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:02,600
system

24
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:04,438
so uh or I was just going to be a victim

25
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,960
of it so I decided I was going to go to

26
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:08,158
college become an

27
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:09,519
attorney and while I was at it if I was

28
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,359
going to put that much into it I might

29
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:13,798
as well become governor and change the

30
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:15,359
marijuana laws in the state of Kentucky

31
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:17,640
and quit treating our people like we're

32
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:20,560
an occupied

33
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:23,400
territory and take the government out of

34
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,799
the the helicopters uh out of the air

35
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,000
that are hovering over the fields and

36
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:27,960
Gardens of the people of state of

37
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Kentucky and put marijuana into the

38
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:32,280
hands as many sick and dying people in

39
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
State as I possibly could and that's

40
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,399
what I started out to do 40 years ago

41
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,759
and I've gotten up every day since that

42
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:39,118
time to do that I've run for office in

43
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,000
the state of Kentucky on several

44
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:44,519
occasions this is my fifth time for

45
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,560
governor I've also run for uh a uh

46
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:49,679
agricultural commissioner attorney

47
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,478
general in Congress twice I've ped some

48
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,920
mighty impressive numbers I won't bore

49
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:56,158
you with them all but let me tell you

50
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,680
that this time we is the very best

51
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:01,159
chance that I've ever had to actually

52
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:03,079
win the governor of the state of

53
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:06,039
Kentucky let me tell you what that would

54
00:02:03,078 --> 00:02:09,000
do to the political landscape in the

55
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:11,759
United States of America that would be

56
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
phenomenal there was an independent uh

57
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:17,280
elected for the first time in 150 years

58
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,840
in Rhode Island last last political

59
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,719
season but he had been a state a US

60
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:25,080
state senator out of that uh out of that

61
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:27,680
state so he already had a Statewide

62
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:29,920
basis to go independent with my running

63
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,439
mate and I are totally independent no

64
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:34,518
party affiliation whatsoever I've got a

65
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:37,719
lady running mate that named D Riley

66
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:40,039
who's phenomenal uh the mother of six

67
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:43,800
two adopted one of her natural children

68
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:46,479
in Special Needs she knows where the the

69
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:48,920
politics hit the road about policies for

70
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:51,318
women and children in the state and

71
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:53,359
she's smart as attack and we need more

72
00:02:51,318 --> 00:02:56,479
women in leadership rols in the state of

73
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:58,720
Kentucky U I am running this time this

74
00:02:56,479 --> 00:03:00,639
is what I say they say galbert you're

75
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:03,080
perennial candidate that's well ky's got

76
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:05,158
perennial problems if the people in

77
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:06,599
Kentucky had who had beaten me had

78
00:03:05,158 --> 00:03:08,919
actually fixed the problems I wouldn't

79
00:03:06,598 --> 00:03:11,318
had to run again but they didn't and

80
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:12,919
they have it and they can't because

81
00:03:11,318 --> 00:03:14,798
neither party can produce a candidate

82
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:16,399
can disengage from the partisanship long

83
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:17,400
enough to work the other side to get the

84
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,799
job

85
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,480
done and the leadership of the parties

86
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:22,959
in both the major parties state of

87
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:24,560
Kentucky had the horns locked up like

88
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,878
two bull elk fighting over territory

89
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,080
while the business of the people lays

90
00:03:25,878 --> 00:03:30,000
dead in the

91
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:32,239
dust so my running rate and I say that

92
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,878
only an independent who doesn't care who

93
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,959
gets credit for doing what's right for

94
00:03:33,878 --> 00:03:37,639
the people of the state of Kentucky

95
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:39,799
stand the best chance of untying that

96
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:42,479
gordian not and letting both parties

97
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:44,400
operate in the fashion that a lot of the

98
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:47,438
well-intentioned membership really want

99
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,799
to want to work the beauty of it is

100
00:03:47,438 --> 00:03:50,079
we're not looking to replace either

101
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,560
party we're not looking to throw the

102
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:55,000
Rascals out we're not looking for you to

103
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,360
vote against your uh you know your

104
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,079
representative or Senator and we don't

105
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,519
want you to renounce your family's party

106
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:03,120
we're not asking you to do that we're

107
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,680
not asking you to vote for the dreaded

108
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,840
other party we're asking you to vote for

109
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,000
an independent who wants to work with

110
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:13,878
you to try to get the job

111
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,439
done and so U I've offered myself again

112
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:19,959
this time and the difference is there

113
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:22,478
are several things uh first of all is

114
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:25,600
that everybody's sick and tired of the

115
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:27,439
gridlock in Kentucky as they say I

116
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,360
accuse Kentucky of being the victim of

117
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:33,959
electile dysfunction that they they just

118
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:37,038
can't seem to get it right and uh so U

119
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:40,120
what we think is that uh we know for a

120
00:04:37,038 --> 00:04:45,199
fact that we're already climbing in the

121
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:48,079
PO I I said the last time uh they they

122
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:50,199
ped us about 6 months ago at 5% they

123
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:53,000
said what' you think I said that's great

124
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:56,240
with me I I believe we'll be 10% by May

125
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:59,478
and 15 to 20% by September we were at

126
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:01,199
133% in April so you know we're moving

127
00:04:59,478 --> 00:05:03,800
on up we're really not spending any

128
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:06,080
money we don't have it to spend uh but

129
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:08,800
I've never spent more than $20,000 on

130
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:10,879
any campaign in the past we spent

131
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,199
140,000 on this so

132
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:15,959
far uh you

133
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:18,639
know 990,000 of it is my

134
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:22,638
money I I practice law for a living I

135
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:26,280
live I live fee to fee uh but I smell it

136
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:28,519
this time I smell it this time that

137
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:30,758
people are sick and tired of it I got

138
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:33,159
endorsed by Union the other day and I

139
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:34,680
said why uh you know why did you folks

140
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:37,199
endorse me he said because you've never

141
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,478
lied to us Gatewood I said well hell if

142
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:42,280
I was going to lied to you I'd already

143
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:44,000
been elected you know and and people are

144
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:47,159
understanding that and people were

145
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,759
gluing into that so uh what does an

146
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,680
election for Gatewood galberth in

147
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:53,199
Kentucky mean for the people of the city

148
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:55,680
of Portland and the C people of Oregon

149
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:58,680
I'll tell you what it means For the

150
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:01,079
First Time In My Memory that I've ever

151
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:03,639
heard the people of America are going to

152
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:05,959
have a champion who believes it when the

153
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:07,720
founding fathers conferred sovereignty

154
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:10,758
on us as human

155
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:12,720
beings when they said that every every

156
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:14,280
human being is endowed by their creator

157
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,280
with life liberty and pursuit of

158
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:19,758
happiness certain inalienable

159
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:21,079
rights and uh for the first time to

160
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:23,598
think about

161
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:25,240
that before the American Revolution came

162
00:06:23,598 --> 00:06:28,159
back we were all

163
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:30,120
property we belong to the local king or

164
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,479
queen to the local Warlord whoever

165
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:34,079
possessed the most gun powder in the

166
00:06:31,478 --> 00:06:35,279
valley you didn't have any inalienable

167
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:36,639
rights people didn't have any

168
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:39,079
inalienable

169
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:41,240
rights if the ruler said hey come in

170
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:43,598
here off with their head there you went

171
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:46,478
there was nobody to intercede on your

172
00:06:43,598 --> 00:06:49,719
behalf but the founding

173
00:06:46,478 --> 00:06:52,120
fathers took humankind out of the

174
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:55,599
category of property and conferred on

175
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:58,038
them the concept of sovereign human

176
00:06:55,598 --> 00:07:00,680
beings self-d

177
00:06:58,038 --> 00:07:02,680
determinative indiv

178
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:04,560
individualized wor something

179
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:07,800
individually and something that the

180
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:10,360
government couldn't take away or mess

181
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:12,800
with and they wrote a

182
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:14,400
constitution the Declaration of

183
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,439
Independence didn't become law but the

184
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:19,679
Constitution they fashioned to try to

185
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:21,038
immortalize that was was their attempt

186
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,079
to write the set of laws that was going

187
00:07:21,038 --> 00:07:26,680
to keep that project in mind so it was a

188
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:29,038
human Revolution that conference of

189
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:31,598
sovereignty on the individual and then

190
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:33,478
they turned just loose and with that

191
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:34,959
kind of Freedom we've come in America

192
00:07:33,478 --> 00:07:36,639
and that's the way supposed to have

193
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:39,239
started out and what we've been trying

194
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:41,800
to keep up but that concept of

195
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:43,079
individual sovereignty is under great

196
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:46,360
pressure

197
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:49,198
today and the current generation is

198
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:51,280
facing the greatest threat of all of

199
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,199
having the Bill of Rights just flat

200
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:56,359
drawn out from underneath

201
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:59,879
us in the uh in the nanny State thought

202
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:04,280
line of protecting us from ourselves

203
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:08,039
but what it is is a is a is a absolute

204
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:10,239
assault on the uh on the Privileges of

205
00:08:08,038 --> 00:08:12,360
sovereign human beings and Sovereign

206
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:15,319
citizens of the

207
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:16,919
Constitution so the uh the right to life

208
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:18,639
Liber and pursuit of happiness is not a

209
00:08:16,918 --> 00:08:20,279
law because it is not in the

210
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:23,038
Constitution but in the state of

211
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:24,519
Kentucky the very first section of the

212
00:08:23,038 --> 00:08:25,839
Constitution of the state of Kentucky

213
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:28,719
says that we are

214
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:30,399
all uh possessed of inalienable right to

215
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,120
life liberty of

216
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:36,079
Happiness so I'm going to reconstruct

217
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,240
ky's policy and kuy's government around

218
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,479
that

219
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:42,560
thesis and we're going to ReDiscover

220
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:44,680
whether America still has a pulse we're

221
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:46,479
going to try to become the template of

222
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:47,439
what freedom of the individual means in

223
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,720
the state of

224
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,839
Kentucky I believe we'll become a

225
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:53,720
tourist

226
00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:56,240
Mecca I believe that people will come in

227
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:57,959
from all around uh the the country and

228
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,560
the globe to see what it likes to live

229
00:08:57,958 --> 00:09:01,078
free

230
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:03,639
and I'm not talking about riots in

231
00:09:01,078 --> 00:09:08,799
streets I'm not talking about uh you

232
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:11,399
know people causing tumult out in public

233
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:13,679
I don't see that happening I just think

234
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:16,440
that the idea that we're attempting it

235
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:18,679
is going to bring in the right-minded

236
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:20,480
people but uh we're going to try to

237
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:22,919
spread it out we're going to try to

238
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:25,680
ReDiscover the American Revolution and

239
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:29,159
we're going to do that by uh putting the

240
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:30,679
processes and the surpluses of a form of

241
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:33,159
government out to the people instead of

242
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:34,479
special interests I know who those

243
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:36,039
special interests are and I'm going to

244
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,360
put a stop to it and the savings we're

245
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:40,039
going to put back into the hands of the

246
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,039
people
