1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,759
what i think is a necessary component

2
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:06,798
all right

3
00:00:03,759 --> 00:00:09,039
look at hemp as earth medicine learn

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:10,880
everything you can possibly learn about

5
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:13,279
hemp the same way you've learned it

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,280
about medical marijuana learn it about

7
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:17,358
hemp and communicate it to the

8
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:18,800
non-medical marijuana part of this

9
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:20,720
community

10
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,960
because when they see the economic

11
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:24,879
environmental realities that can that

12
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,640
would be produced by this renewable

13
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:29,678
energy source of hemp

14
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,679
the dynamic will change but

15
00:00:29,678 --> 00:00:33,439
but it's a decision that you have to

16
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:35,839
make whether you're willing to put your

17
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:38,878
energy in to connecting with hemp energy

18
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,719
to create a larger energy anyway and

19
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:44,640
vote him if you're going to vote vote

20
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,640
him all right that's it
