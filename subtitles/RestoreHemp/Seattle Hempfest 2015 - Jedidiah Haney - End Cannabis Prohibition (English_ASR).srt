midair look at all these canna warriors

5
00:00:13,859 --> 00:00:18,660
around you volunteering their time

6
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:21,390
putting their energy into this effort

7
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:24,420
which is called cannabis freedom so

8
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:28,170

9
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:32,219
our day every day should be our day yeah

10
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:33,960
i was thinking trying to think why what

11
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:36,079
i want to talk to you guys about why I'm

12
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:39,890
up here you know I'm thinking to myself

13
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:42,799
last year I was just out there a bender

14
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:46,579
handing out cards giving out information

15
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:49,109
telling people keep Washington green

16
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:51,030
right people are like what do you mean

17
00:00:49,109 --> 00:00:54,780
keep Washington green we just legalized

18
00:00:51,030 --> 00:01:00,448
it does this look like legalization to

19
00:00:54,780 --> 00:01:02,579
you why because you're fleeing to the

20
00:01:00,448 --> 00:01:06,239
rocks and under the trees to smoke some

21
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:07,890
freakin cannabis well you know what I'm

22
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:09,420
really proud of our head pass through

23
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:10,950
and our half the staff because they're

24
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:12,810
keeping our freedoms alive and our

25
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:14,790
dreams alive and they're doing their

26
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:17,009
thing and you know what this reminds me

27
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:18,720
of years pass and hemp fest so we still

28
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:20,759
celebrate our freedoms and we still

29
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:22,769
smoke cannabis where we want to and how

30
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:26,969
we want to and we're going to continue

31
00:01:22,769 --> 00:01:29,429
to do that so celebrate today I have a

32
00:01:26,969 --> 00:01:32,390
main message to you this this battle is

33
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:36,180
not done we have a lot of work to do

34
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:38,129
there's a there's a recreational scheme

35
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:40,770
which we have in our state where you can

36
00:01:38,129 --> 00:01:43,109
purchase cannabis that's great I voted

37
00:01:40,769 --> 00:01:45,118
for that I'm fighting for that I know

38
00:01:43,109 --> 00:01:47,728
business owners that are putting in

39
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:49,409
their due diligence I also know some

40
00:01:47,728 --> 00:01:51,629
really lame business owners that are

41
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:53,960
doing some horse stuff for industry but

42
00:01:51,629 --> 00:01:56,329
we won't talk about that right now

43
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:57,649
we will talk about is the fact that just

44
00:01:56,329 --> 00:02:02,569
because we can buy it in the store

45
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:06,740
doesn't mean it's free I want to grow it

46
00:02:02,569 --> 00:02:13,039
in my backyard I want to smoke it where

47
00:02:06,739 --> 00:02:16,669
I want to I bet you do too 1.7 million

48
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:19,400
people in this state voted for i-502 and

49
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:21,229
about three-quarters more of that still

50
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,700
think that you can grow plants in this

51
00:02:21,229 --> 00:02:25,459
state just because you don't have a

52
00:02:22,699 --> 00:02:27,589
medicine card you know what I think we

53
00:02:25,459 --> 00:02:30,439
all need to get educated about what our

54
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:32,930
public policy is what our state policy

55
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:35,329
isn't get involved I know one thing's

56
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:37,370
for sure i clambered up to the state

57
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:40,100
politics this last year and observe the

58
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:43,250
most dysfunctional state legislative

59
00:02:40,099 --> 00:02:46,549
session entire history of Washington

60
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:50,689
State we went through three sessions

61
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:52,730
that's one session plus two more and we

62
00:02:50,689 --> 00:02:55,430
couldn't even figure out our state taxes

63
00:02:52,729 --> 00:02:57,799
and in fact if you're watching the state

64
00:02:55,430 --> 00:03:00,709
Supreme Court just suit our state

65
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:03,500
legislature a hundred thousand dollars a

66
00:03:00,709 --> 00:03:07,789
day until they figure out how to educate

67
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:10,400
our freaking kids I'm upset I am a

68
00:03:07,789 --> 00:03:12,709
citizen I voted for cannabis freedom

69
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:16,459
they're taxing it and they can't even

70
00:03:12,709 --> 00:03:18,199
educate my kids I want you guys to get

71
00:03:16,459 --> 00:03:20,840
involved because this is not going to

72
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:24,859
end we need to go up there and tell them

73
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:27,379
I want my cannabis I don't want it to be

74
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:31,130
shoved through a tax regulated system

75
00:03:27,379 --> 00:03:33,739
and come out dirty I want to have my

76
00:03:31,129 --> 00:03:36,530
rights and we're not going to get our

77
00:03:33,739 --> 00:03:38,900
rights until we get up there we clamber

78
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:41,109
up there and tell all of them this is

79
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:43,700
how I want it and I want it right now

80
00:03:41,109 --> 00:03:44,900
because if we don't do that what they're

81
00:03:43,699 --> 00:03:47,268
going to do is they're going to do what

82
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:49,519
they did a 502 they're going to stifle

83
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:52,129
it they're going to throw fifty-four

84
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:54,890
percent in this state into default of a

85
00:03:52,129 --> 00:03:57,259
state law that's actually in conflict

86
00:03:54,889 --> 00:03:59,719
with our state constitution if you read

87
00:03:57,259 --> 00:04:03,039
article 11 section 11 it's only two

88
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:06,250
lines long so please look it up it says

89
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:08,979
no jurisdiction can pass laws that are

90
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:12,818
outside of general law that means they

91
00:04:08,979 --> 00:04:16,358
cannot ban cannabis they cannot ban all

92
00:04:12,818 --> 00:04:18,668
rights to save access they cannot do

93
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:21,099
what they're doing and we need to go

94
00:04:18,668 --> 00:04:22,779
into the city council and those county

95
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:25,710
commissioners will you tell them you are

96
00:04:22,779 --> 00:04:28,138
wrong it says so right here in our

97
00:04:25,709 --> 00:04:30,758
Constitution and I don't care what

98
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:34,210
organization and what Attorney General

99
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:40,180
comes out with any opinion or citizen

100
00:04:34,209 --> 00:04:42,939
right Stan didn't both with me guys it's

101
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:45,579
not that hard I only put in a couple of

102
00:04:42,939 --> 00:04:47,709
days a week I still do a lot of fun

103
00:04:45,579 --> 00:04:50,050
things I work with awesome people every

104
00:04:47,709 --> 00:04:52,239
day and people share cannabis with me

105
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:54,550
every day and when they do that they

106
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:58,150
break the law I don't want to do that

107
00:04:54,550 --> 00:05:00,879
anymore I want to be free I wouldn't be

108
00:04:58,149 --> 00:05:03,579
a person I want to be a professional I

109
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:05,918
want to be whoever I want to be and have

110
00:05:03,579 --> 00:05:10,629
the right to cannabis and I want you to

111
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:12,519
have that right to right I want you to

112
00:05:10,629 --> 00:05:14,740
take pay attention to one other thing in

113
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:16,448
denver colorado maybe they're doing it

114
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:18,819
right maybe we're doing it wrong the one

115
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:21,490
thing they are doing is they got a

116
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:25,300
general ballot to a local level to

117
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:28,060
consume cannabis in public at at any

118
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:30,129
location that has any other smoking so

119
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:32,740
if you earn a cafe or restaurant and

120
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:34,538
they have a smoking area you can consume

121
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:37,658
cannabis out there if it's okay with

122
00:05:34,538 --> 00:05:39,610
that owner of that it's an entity right

123
00:05:37,658 --> 00:05:41,589
at that establishment so think about

124
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:42,939
that guys we're all around here

125
00:05:41,589 --> 00:05:44,978
frustrated we just want to smoke some

126
00:05:42,939 --> 00:05:47,408
cannabis we have to go over here to the

127
00:05:44,978 --> 00:05:49,180
rocks we have to go over there you know

128
00:05:47,408 --> 00:05:52,149
they can serve alcohol they can tax

129
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:54,970
alcohol but they can serve cannabis know

130
00:05:52,149 --> 00:05:58,509
what is going on here we need to check

131
00:05:54,970 --> 00:06:01,599
this out it only takes what was it 3,700

132
00:05:58,509 --> 00:06:03,339
citizens the city of Denver I bet you it

133
00:06:01,598 --> 00:06:05,709
takes a little bit around that here in

134
00:06:03,339 --> 00:06:07,899
Seattle so I'm going to ask you one last

135
00:06:05,709 --> 00:06:09,848
thing if you care about cannabis and you

136
00:06:07,899 --> 00:06:12,779
care about freedom of cannabis get

137
00:06:09,848 --> 00:06:12,779
involved
