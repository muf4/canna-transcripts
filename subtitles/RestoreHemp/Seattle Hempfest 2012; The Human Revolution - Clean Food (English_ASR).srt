1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:04,720
so I got this crazy idea that we should

2
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:06,359
replace all the GMO have you guys ever

3
00:00:04,719 --> 00:00:09,759
driven across the country and seen all

4
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:10,839
those GMO like corn GMO soy some of

5
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:12,400
y'all probably don't even know that

6
00:00:10,839 --> 00:00:16,000
that's actually going in all of our food

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,920
and it's completely poisonous and um

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,240
there we go now we got to do something

9
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,720
about all that so I have this crazy idea

10
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:23,518
that we're going to like replace all

11
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:25,000
those corn fields that are all going to

12
00:00:23,518 --> 00:00:26,598
feed cattle all over the world and

13
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,879
they're poisonous we should replace it

14
00:00:26,599 --> 00:00:30,879
with hemp what do you think

15
00:00:33,799 --> 00:00:39,399
then we'll have clean food we'll have a

16
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:41,359
real economy for our

17
