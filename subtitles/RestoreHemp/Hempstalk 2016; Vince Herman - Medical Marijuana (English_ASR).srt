1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,879
yeah I just got my medical card renewed

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:09,138
just this past week and found out that

3
00:00:05,878 --> 00:00:12,888
my doctor is losing his medical license

4
00:00:09,138 --> 00:00:15,088
because the Oregon State Medical Board

5
00:00:12,888 --> 00:00:19,049
decided that he was driving too many

6
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:20,640
prescriptions for this kinda stuff and I

7
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:22,439
imagine they might have been getting a

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:26,960
little pressure from the pharmaceutical

9
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:33,929
industry which is losing money to the

10
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:36,510
founder for seriously isn't it awful but

11
00:00:33,929 --> 00:00:39,000
you know we're gonna win in the long run

12
00:00:36,509 --> 00:00:41,429
you know but in the meantime here's

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,659
great doctor Ben he's not allowed to

14
00:00:41,429 --> 00:00:46,769
practice medicine that next week because

15
00:00:44,659 --> 00:00:48,959
he's fighting a battle that we're all

16
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:50,940
fighting and you know so keep up the

17
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,070
good work folks get up from the folks we

18
00:00:50,939 --> 00:00:55,109
put on this fence and keep it in

19
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:57,030
people's mind that there's still a lot

20
00:00:55,109 --> 00:00:59,250
of lot of work to do

21
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:00,120
our Portland's a great time to do it and

22
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:03,219
I'll tell you that

23
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:03,219
