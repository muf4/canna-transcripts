00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:04,639
I'm from Washington State I know we're

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:06,918
in Oregon right now but some people from

3
00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:09,039
Vancouver might be visiting today if you

4
00:00:06,918 --> 00:00:10,960
know anybody in washingon tell them we

5
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:13,638
did legalize recreational but the

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,480
lawmakers in Washington think that means

7
00:00:13,638 --> 00:00:19,358
that we no longer need to be allowed to

8
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:21,880
grow 15 plants I think that's ridiculous

9
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:24,519
the lawmakers are acting like children

10
00:00:21,879 --> 00:00:26,759
I'm ashamed to be a Washingtonian now

11
00:00:24,518 --> 00:00:28,839
that this law is on the books the fact

12
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:31,480
that our governor signed this law on the

13
00:00:28,839 --> 00:00:34,000
books makes me ashamed to be a

14
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:36,719
Washingtonian so look for

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,519
r76 this will undo what the governor

16
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,320
just did and it will maintain medical

17
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:43,520
marijuana in Washington state the way it

18
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,320
is it will let us keep growing 15 plants

19
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,920
it will allow the farmers markets to

20
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:48,679
keep happening and providing the highest

21
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,480
quality most affordable medicine to

22
00:00:48,679 --> 00:00:53,679
patients who need it tell your friends

23
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:55,439
about real legalization in Washington

24
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:56,159
state we need volunteers to help with

25
00:00:55,439 --> 00:01:01,799
the

26
00:00:56,159 --> 00:01:01,799
r76 referendum thank you
