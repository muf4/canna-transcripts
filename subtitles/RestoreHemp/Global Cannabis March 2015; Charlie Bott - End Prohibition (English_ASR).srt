1
00:00:00,659 --> 00:00:03,899
hi everybody

2
00:00:03,178 --> 00:00:06,240
um

3
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:08,820
glad to be here today

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,839
um I've been an activist like you said a

5
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,419
lot of people might know me from the

6
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:13,980
cafe I was there from most of the time

7
00:00:12,419 --> 00:00:15,480
it was it's had it had a location

8
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:18,839
hopefully we'll have a location sometime

9
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:21,539
again but a lot more people know me from

10
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:23,160
Facebook where I started

11
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:26,279
basically as soon as I got on Facebook

12
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:28,320
back in 2008 was very about the same

13
00:00:26,278 --> 00:00:31,198
time I got hooked up with Oregon normal

14
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:34,320
through going to the meetings where we

15
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,700
gave away clones and medicine to people

16
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,640
who couldn't afford

17
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:39,960
to buy it or you know have their own

18
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,558
Growers and stuff

19
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,558
um

20
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:45,299
so I got very involved with that and I'm

21
00:00:43,558 --> 00:00:48,599
very happy for the chance to talk here

22
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:48,599
today but

23
00:00:49,378 --> 00:00:53,039
well

24
00:00:51,179 --> 00:00:55,039
I think it's important not only to talk

25
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:58,320
to your legislatures

26
00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:00,539
but also to talk just to your family and

27
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,399
your friends who are not you know out

28
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:05,040
here today you know preaching to the

29
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,478
choir is a wonderful thing to do

30
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,118
and

31
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:10,739
um you'll do it you know a lot if you

32
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:12,060
get the chance to speak to people a lot

33
00:01:10,739 --> 00:01:14,280
most of the people you talk to will be

34
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:17,040
people who agree with you but there's a

35
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:20,280
lot of people out there who listen to

36
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,560
reason as we can see passing the measure

37
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:26,040
91 here 56 percent

38
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,960
was a big victory for you know

39
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,939
our movement and the world and

40
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:31,438
especially when several months before

41
00:01:29,938 --> 00:01:34,500
the year before we were told by the

42
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:36,779
marijuana policy project that we

43
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:39,359
shouldn't seek to legalize in 2014

44
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:41,099
because it was an off-year election and

45
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:43,618
people wouldn't come out and things

46
00:01:41,099 --> 00:01:45,478
wouldn't happen because of um

47
00:01:43,618 --> 00:01:46,859
experience they had in the past with gay

48
00:01:45,478 --> 00:01:48,239
marriage and

49
00:01:46,859 --> 00:01:50,640
um which is a great issue and I'm glad

50
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:52,500
to see that moving forward and and it's

51
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,460
another issue that has Unstoppable

52
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:58,200
momentum but when you look at

53
00:01:55,459 --> 00:02:00,899
consistent pulling across the country

54
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,899
which puts support for medical marijuana

55
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:06,060
at 80 percent and higher among the

56
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:06,960
general population

57
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:10,679
um

58
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:14,759
it's um time for the politicians to just

59
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:16,500
get with the program and the way to make

60
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:20,098
that happen again is to contact your

61
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,818
legislatures write letters uh emails I

62
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:22,219
got

63
00:02:20,818 --> 00:02:25,679
um this

64
00:02:22,219 --> 00:02:27,120
sb844 which Aaron was talking about a

65
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,700
minute ago where they're making changes

66
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:32,640
to the medical program I've emailed back

67
00:02:29,699 --> 00:02:34,318
and forth with Peter Buckley and some of

68
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:37,559
the suggestions that I made actually

69
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:39,539
made it into the latest amendments uh

70
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:44,280
structure so they listen they're trying

71
00:02:39,539 --> 00:02:46,079
to do things right and they know that

72
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,818
um there's a lot at stake

73
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,219
and they're listening and it's very good

74
00:02:47,818 --> 00:02:52,859
to see that happening here and to

75
00:02:50,219 --> 00:02:55,680
provide an example for the people who um

76
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:57,840
will come after us and um because in

77
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,060
2016 we'll probably see legalization

78
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:03,180
initiatives in California

79
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:04,319
we'll get the whole West Coast

80
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:06,120
um legal

81
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:08,878
for uh for adults it'll be great and

82
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,800
also and Nevada possibly Massachusetts

83
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:13,579
Rhode Island and Maine are talking about

84
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:16,439
doing it through the legislator Ohio

85
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:19,099
supposedly has half the signatures they

86
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:23,459
need to get it on the ballot for 2015

87
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:25,378
passing legalization in Ohio and in an

88
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:27,019
odd year would be

89
00:03:25,378 --> 00:03:29,939
almost

90
00:03:27,019 --> 00:03:31,739
Unthinkable but it may happen

91
00:03:29,939 --> 00:03:32,939
um but while all this good stuff is

92
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:34,319
happening and we're giving a good

93
00:03:32,939 --> 00:03:37,259
example

94
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:39,839
um people are still being executed

95
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:43,439
um around the world for cannabis

96
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:46,019
trafficking crimes it last weekend in

97
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:48,959
Indonesia one of the nine people who

98
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:52,379
were put in front of a firing squad was

99
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:54,420
Cannabis trafficker and he was killed

100
00:03:52,378 --> 00:03:56,219
for it and then every year Indonesia

101
00:03:54,419 --> 00:03:58,619
Malaysia

102
00:03:56,219 --> 00:04:00,780
Saudi Arabia a couple other different

103
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:02,700
countries there's about nine around the

104
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:07,378
world that still execute people for drug

105
00:04:02,699 --> 00:04:09,959
crimes and the drug war just has to end

106
00:04:07,378 --> 00:04:11,158
that's you know the the violence we saw

107
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:13,860
last week

108
00:04:11,158 --> 00:04:15,539
in Maryland uh around the Freddie gray

109
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:20,459
killing

110
00:04:15,539 --> 00:04:23,779
um is you know made possible by the no

111
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:26,879
knock raids and other

112
00:04:23,779 --> 00:04:30,539
exorbitant measures that have been just

113
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:34,319
become every day events for the police

114
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:38,160
to put on there have been SWAT raids and

115
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:41,879
no knock raids and people just shouldn't

116
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:45,060
be dying for this plant that can save so

117
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:47,879
many people and which

118
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:50,879
um we're finding out now the hemp side

119
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:53,159
of things we can make batteries for a

120
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:56,579
small fraction of the cost graphene

121
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:58,020
level batteries that will hold a

122
00:04:56,579 --> 00:05:00,599
tremendous charge for a tremendous

123
00:04:58,019 --> 00:05:04,159
amount of time at a much much cheaper

124
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:08,400
cost than it would to make it from the

125
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:10,080
scientifically otherwise derived stuff

126
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:12,060
um but things are going in the right

127
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:15,478
direction it's good to see Brave

128
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:17,399
Michaela up here and but keep in mind

129
00:05:15,478 --> 00:05:20,099
that last month

130
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:25,138
in Kansas

131
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:27,360
um an 11 year old boy was in a drug

132
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:29,699
education class and they were talking

133
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:32,340
about how these people should avoid

134
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:34,800
cannabis and it was had evil ill health

135
00:05:32,339 --> 00:05:37,500
effects and this 11 year old stood up

136
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,900
and said no it doesn't it saved my

137
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:41,699
mother's life and he went down to list

138
00:05:39,899 --> 00:05:43,799
all the good things that cannabis does

139
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:44,699
for people well

140
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:47,939
um

141
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:50,939
that ended up with him being taken away

142
00:05:47,939 --> 00:05:53,399
from his mother so Shona Banda

143
00:05:50,939 --> 00:05:56,399
who's a woman in again she's in Kansas

144
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:57,839
she saved her life she had Crohn's

145
00:05:56,399 --> 00:06:00,839
disease and was on the brink of death

146
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:03,299
and discovered that cannabis oil could

147
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:04,978
save her and now she's instead of being

148
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:07,520
bedridden and not being able even to

149
00:06:04,978 --> 00:06:11,219
hold her kid when which she was

150
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:12,478
at the time she's you know an activist

151
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:13,259
and

152
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:15,839
um

153
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:17,160
and she had to she's lost her kid for

154
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:19,319
the time being

155
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:22,919
um so this stuff is still going on there

156
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:24,839
are people dying and there's the

157
00:06:22,918 --> 00:06:26,579
legislation that's coming out there's a

158
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:29,698
lot of legislation coming out

159
00:06:26,579 --> 00:06:31,680
in places like Oklahoma of all places in

160
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:32,340
Georgia

161
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,459
um

162
00:06:32,339 --> 00:06:38,399
but there's CBD only laws which

163
00:06:35,459 --> 00:06:40,439
um people want because their CBD is very

164
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:42,959
helpful with seizures and stuff and it

165
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:45,959
doesn't get you high but that keeps out

166
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:48,120
the THC which does so much

167
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:49,500
for so much the whole plant medicine is

168
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:52,259
really the way to go

169
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:53,879
and anything other than that is an
