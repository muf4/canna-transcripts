1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:05,318
Federal considerations we have you know

2
00:00:03,399 --> 00:00:07,120
Federal considerations related to this

3
00:00:05,318 --> 00:00:09,879
and you're all aware of this and the

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,798
OLCC is very aware of this marijuana

5
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:15,879
remains illegal under federal law all

6
00:00:11,798 --> 00:00:18,480
right so it's a business risk right so

7
00:00:15,878 --> 00:00:21,480
we just point that out to everybody

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,278
however on August 29th 2013 the US

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,160
Department of Justice issued guidance to

10
00:00:23,278 --> 00:00:27,599
the states that have legalized

11
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:29,599
recreational marijuana they've issued

12
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,679
guidance under what is called the coal

13
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:34,759
memor

14
00:00:30,678 --> 00:00:36,558
c l e so the co memorandum provides the

15
00:00:34,759 --> 00:00:38,920
guidance to states that are putting

16
00:00:36,558 --> 00:00:41,640
recreational marijuana into effect the

17
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:44,320
coal memorandum um doesn't have the

18
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,159
force of law it's merely an opinion of

19
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,520
the US attorney's office under the

20
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:50,640
current Administration Administration to

21
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:52,600
Administration could change that so it

22
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,480
doesn't have the force of law if you'd

23
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:59,558
like to look at the colle memorandum in

24
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:59,558
its original form go to marijuana.org

25
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:05,239
Federal guidance this is the main points

26
00:01:04,118 --> 00:01:07,118
of the coal

27
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:09,359
memorandum so the main points of the

28
00:01:07,118 --> 00:01:11,719
coal memorandum are to one prevent the

29
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:14,719
distribution of marijuana to

30
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:16,079
minors two prevent revenue from the sale

31
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:19,599
of marijuana from going to criminal

32
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:19,599
Enterprises gangs and

33
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:24,200
cartels three prevent the diversion of

34
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,240
marijuana from where it is legal under

35
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:29,040
state law to other states so we don't

36
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:32,158
want it Go in out of state no interstate

37
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,600
commerce four prevent State authorized

38
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:37,960
activity from being used as a cover for

39
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:39,319
illegal activity we don't want to be

40
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:41,438
growing things in the recreational

41
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:43,438
market and then W all of a sudden

42
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:45,319
they're all over the country so that's

43
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:47,959
what they don't want to have

44
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:49,559
happen five prevent violence and the use

45
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:52,000
of firearms in the cultivation and

46
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:54,960
distribution of

47
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
marijuana six prevent drug driving and

48
00:01:54,959 --> 00:02:00,118
other adverse Public Health consequences

49
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,039
associated with marijuana use

50
00:02:00,118 --> 00:02:04,239
seven prevent the growing of marijuana

51
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:07,599
on public

52
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:10,560
lands and eight prevent marijuana use on

53
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:12,079
public property those see the eight kind

54
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,239
of principal points of what the coal

55
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,360
memoranda says but again go to

56
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:18,680
marijuana. org.gov to take a look at the

57
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:21,319
original by

58
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:23,000
yourself in order to meet the precepts

59
00:02:21,318 --> 00:02:26,878
of those eight points from the coal

60
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,080
memorandum both Colorado and Washington

61
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:31,560
and the state of Oregon is now looking

62
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:33,840
at right now and in the process of

63
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:36,598
preparing a request for proposal for a

64
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:39,759
seed to sale tracking system we don't

65
00:02:36,598 --> 00:02:41,518
feel that we can comply with federal law

66
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:43,598
without having a seed to sale tracking

67
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,680
system all

68
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:48,199
right I already said Colorado and

69
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,519
Washington require it and the reason

70
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:52,439
they require it is so that taxes are

71
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:55,719
properly collected and that the

72
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:58,840
inventory does not migrate from the

73
00:02:55,719 --> 00:03:02,239
residential Market into a black or gray

74
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:04,640
Market so that's the reason we have um

75
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,158
the SE to sale tracking system it's

76
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:08,479
designed for more effective Audits and

77
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:10,798
to satisfy federal

78
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:13,479
guidelines it's also for

79
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:15,799
efficiency we can't have people going to

80
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:17,560
every recreational marijuana grow and

81
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:19,400
whatever and you know individually

82
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:21,120
counting every single plant we'd have a

83
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:24,080
fleet of Auditors we need to be able to

84
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,959
go through and with a oneand with RFID

85
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,280
tags and be able to say how many plants

86
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:28,479
are here and what's going on and are

87
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,400
they properly where they're supposed to

88
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:32,959
be and those kinds of things it's for

89
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,599
efficiency not only for us but for for

90
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,120
the operations and that's what they do

91
00:03:34,598 --> 00:03:39,119
in in a lot of the manufacturing

92
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,120
Industries today
