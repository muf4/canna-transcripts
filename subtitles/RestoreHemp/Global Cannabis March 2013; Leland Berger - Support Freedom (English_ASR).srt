1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,040
hey i want to talk to you about two

2
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:04,640
things and i want to ask you to do two

3
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,720
things okay

4
00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:08,320
the first thing is that you know i'm a

5
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:10,400
proud member of the normal legal

6
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,480
committee national organization to

7
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,120
reform the marijuana laws

8
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,920
and uh in our legal committees about 450

9
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:19,679
lawyers nationally and we look after

10
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,760
folks that are charged with cannabis

11
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:24,160
related offenses and we do education and

12
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,400
outreach and other stuff but lately

13
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,560
lately the leaders of normal alan st

14
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:31,038
pierre the executive director

15
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:32,719
and keith straub the legal counsel have

16
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,719
been making public statements that

17
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,320
aren't really what normal is about

18
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,558
alan's been saying for example that

19
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,238
medical marijuana is a sham normal

20
00:00:38,558 --> 00:00:43,119
doesn't think medical marijuana is a

21
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:46,718
sham but allen says that publicly he

22
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:48,399
says oh five nanograms that's okay

23
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,640
you know that's probably a reasonable

24
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,558
level for uh driving under the influence

25
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,920
and that's not normal's position at all

26
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:59,119
normal's been fighting hard to

27
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:01,840
to uh to to make sure that there aren't

28
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:03,119
per se driving around the influence laws

29
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,640
passed

30
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:06,319
and uh so what i'd like you to do the

31
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,478
first thing i'm going to ask you to do

32
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:12,399
is i want you to write to alan and keith

33
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:13,599
it's alan normal.org norml.org

34
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,159
and keith

35
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:17,679
normal.org norml.org

36
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,000
and let them know that you heard me talk

37
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,960
about this and and ask them to knock it

38
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,400
off

39
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:27,118
