2
00:00:02,158 --> 00:00:08,599
of all the world.

3
00:00:04,919 --> 00:00:12,280
Dear, you are the

4
00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:15,720
one. My favorite

5
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:19,320
human under the

6
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:22,679
sun. What brings

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:26,599
tomorrow, we never

8
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:31,039
know. So, you'd better kiss

9
00:00:26,599 --> 00:00:33,799
me before you go.

10
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:37,320
There are the

11
00:00:33,799 --> 00:00:41,000
flowers. There are the

12
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:44,679
trees. There's you and me,

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,039
dear. Among all

14
00:00:44,679 --> 00:00:51,320
these. Sooner or

15
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:55,239
later, there is

16
00:00:51,320 --> 00:01:00,320
goodbye. So kiss me once more,

17
00:00:55,238 --> 00:01:00,320
dear, in case we die.

18
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:07,158
Death could be

19
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:11,118
waiting outside of this

20
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:14,040
room, anticipating.

21
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:17,640
Yours and my potential

22
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:22,240
doom. We could be

23
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:24,519
walking trip on our own feet.

24
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:28,519
Not even to

25
00:01:24,519 --> 00:01:31,959
mention all the psychos we

26
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:35,078
meet. Sooner or

27
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:38,919
later, there is

28
00:01:35,078 --> 00:01:44,039
goodbye. So kiss me once more,

29
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:46,560
dear. In case we die, take it,

30
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:51,479
Kathy. I don't really have a solo for

31
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,478
this. Neither do I. Take it.

32
00:01:52,438 --> 00:01:57,599
H I wish I could think of something

33
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:01,759
cool. It's almost over. You can just

34
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:05,718
take it now. I can take the rest. Oh,

35
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,718
no. I can't. I'm just strumming.

36
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,719
Are you screwed that way? Take it out of

37
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,719
the key.

38
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:18,519
Death could be

39
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:21,399
waiting outside of this

40
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:24,480
room,

41
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:26,239
anticipating yours and my potential

42
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:28,679
doom.

43
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:32,120
We could be

44
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:35,480
walking trip on our own

45
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:39,480
feet, not even to

46
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:42,840
mention all the psychos we

47
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:45,959
meet. Sooner or

48
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:50,800
later, there is

49
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:53,080
goodbye. So kiss me once more, dear.

50
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:57,080
In case we

51
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:59,319
die, kiss me once more,

52
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,520
dear. In case

53
00:02:59,318 --> 00:03:04,439
we

54
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:07,200
[Music]

55
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:10,199
die. Thank you guys. Thank you very

56
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:10,199
much.
