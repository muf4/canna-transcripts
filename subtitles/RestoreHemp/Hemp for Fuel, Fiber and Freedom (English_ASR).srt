1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:04,240
now this is the whole reason marijuana

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:06,758
is illegal Yep this is hemp seed oil

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,719
with a hemp Wick and it is an illuminant

4
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:11,000
hemp was an original illuminant before

5
00:00:08,718 --> 00:00:13,798
they Ed whale order oil before they were

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,359
using petroleum hip seed oil was one of

7
00:00:13,798 --> 00:00:19,879
the first uh illuminants used by

8
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:21,439
Humanity to uh light the first lamps and

9
00:00:19,879 --> 00:00:23,640
this is the whole reason it's illegal

10
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:26,118
because you can pour this hemp oil right

11
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,719
into any diesel engine turn the key and

12
00:00:26,118 --> 00:00:31,000
drive it hemp oil produces three times

13
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:33,920
more seed oil than any other plant on

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
the planet it also produces three times

15
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:40,600
more fiber and here's some HP twine uh

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,799
this is uh uh produced in China hemp

17
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:46,520
twine from China so the main reason

18
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:49,119
marijuana is illegal is because of hemp

19
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:52,559
oil and hemp fiber and marijuana laws

20
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:54,839
were created to stop the oil companies

21
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:56,718
from competing with hemp fiber with the

22
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:00,079
introduction of new Machinery that made

23
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:02,399
hemp Fuel and fiber much less expensive

24
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,319
much less expensive to process much as

25
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,760
the cotton genin had made cotton much

26
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:10,359
cheaper to process 100 years before this

27
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:13,719
new Machinery the decorticator had made

28
00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:17,599
uh hemp fiber much cheaper so the uh

29
00:01:13,719 --> 00:01:19,478
Fuel and fiber companies uh put together

30
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:21,399
a misinformation campaign we know as

31
00:01:19,478 --> 00:01:24,438
reer Madness and came up with this name

32
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:27,200
marijuana based on racist lies as the

33
00:01:24,438 --> 00:01:31,118
name marijuana proves I mean it's based

34
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:34,040
on anti-hispanic and uh people of color

35
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:38,640
racist propaganda that was prevalent in

36
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:40,479
the 20s and 30s and so uh uh here is the

37
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,599
whole reason that marijuana is illegal

38
00:01:40,478 --> 00:01:44,718
it has nothing to do with drugs drugs

39
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:48,438
are a smoke screen it's really about

40
00:01:44,718 --> 00:01:50,438
Fuel and fiber exactly and there's a

41
00:01:48,438 --> 00:01:53,599
very we're going to do this every week

42
00:01:50,438 --> 00:01:57,398
folks uh I I just love the hemp candle

43
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:59,319
idea so this is our flame of Freedom

44
00:01:57,399 --> 00:02:02,478
that uh we're going to be talking about

45
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:02,478
each and every show
