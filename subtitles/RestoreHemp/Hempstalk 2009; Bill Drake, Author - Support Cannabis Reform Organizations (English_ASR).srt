1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:03,799
well the shest way to empty a room is

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,480
for an old guy to start telling his life

3
00:00:03,799 --> 00:00:10,879
story so I promise you I won't do

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,880
that I wrote the cultivator handbook in

5
00:00:13,638 --> 00:00:20,079
1968 I wrote it because at the time we

6
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:24,519
were engaged in a terrible war in

7
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:26,559
Asia uh DEA didn't exist was the FBI

8
00:00:24,518 --> 00:00:29,439
enforcing drug

9
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:30,598
laws Richard Nixon our criminal

10
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:33,480
president

11
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:35,079
as the man in the White House and I've

12
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:38,479
been growing for a couple of years and I

13
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:41,160
realized that if if we were going to be

14
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:44,038
free truly free in this country we had

15
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:46,799
to be able to grow what we want to

16
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:49,439
consume whether it's marijuana whether

17
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:51,919
it's our own garden of vegetables

18
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:55,439
whether it's opium whatever it is you

19
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:57,879
want to grow if it's a natural plant if

20
00:00:55,439 --> 00:01:01,518
it's a free gift from God that is your

21
00:00:57,878 --> 00:01:04,118
right now those rights

22
00:01:01,518 --> 00:01:08,039
don't exist unless people like Paul

23
00:01:04,118 --> 00:01:11,719
Sanford and and Oregon normal enforce

24
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:14,439
those rights in our name you know when

25
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:16,719
somebody like Paul Stanford goes to his

26
00:01:14,438 --> 00:01:18,758
state representative and says I've got

27
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:21,959
an organization with 200 people in it

28
00:01:18,759 --> 00:01:24,239
who vote they're going to yawn at him he

29
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:26,879
says I got an organization with 2,000

30
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:29,478
people in it and they vote they might

31
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:31,599
pay attention if he says I got 10,000

32
00:01:29,478 --> 00:01:33,039
people in they're all registered and

33
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:36,640
they all

34
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,960
vote then the politicians listen so as

35
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,959
much as I hate belonging to

36
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:42,759
organizations and those who know me will

37
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:44,399
