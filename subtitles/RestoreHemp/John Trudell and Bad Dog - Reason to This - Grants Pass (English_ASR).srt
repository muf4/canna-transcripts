last night in he

00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:15,320
dream I interrogated

00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:18,399
God why is it the Good Die

00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:22,198
Young what's the reason to

00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:26,358
this we talked we argued we

00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:31,960
cried I never did getting

8
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:31,960

00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:52,759
answers already know a question for the

12
00:00:49,198 --> 00:00:56,159
question who is it took the creation

13
00:00:52,759 --> 00:01:01,920
story claimed it and took it

14
00:00:56,159 --> 00:01:01,919
apart glorifying obedience and fear

15
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:08,799
stamping uncertainty Into the

16
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:12,438
Heart rampaging through the

17
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:15,479
mind and then there's that original sin

18
00:01:12,438 --> 00:01:18,559
and something about the devil to pay and

19
00:01:15,478 --> 00:01:20,759
that Golden Rule do unto others

20
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:24,359
obviously isn't really a

21
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:26,879
rule the lord giveth the lord taketh

read it said in the beginning was
