4
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:32,039
reality was it was poor pay in our there

6
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:36,479

7
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:39,750
doing hard toward and we did like 32

8
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:43,140
cities you know in 40 days or something

9
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:47,299
like that but we got we started losing

10
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:50,399
band members 70 members of a band

11
00:00:47,299 --> 00:00:52,530

12
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:55,439
members along the way time we got the

13
00:00:52,530 --> 00:01:00,808

hung in there

17
00:01:07,349 --> 00:01:12,750
but that's how we did this other

18
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:14,520
necessity because it was we needed to do

19
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:17,430
