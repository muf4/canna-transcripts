1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,070
in a way my my attitude is you know

2
00:00:05,209 --> 00:00:10,080
we can complain and blame the bad guys

3
00:00:08,369 --> 00:00:11,729
and we can cry around a lot about how

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,559
they're not fair and things like that

5
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:15,809
you know but that's who they are always

6
00:00:13,558 --> 00:00:18,528
been that way right and that just plain

7
00:00:15,808 --> 00:00:18,528
simple reality

8
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:24,480
and I just think when I look at him I'm

9
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:25,528
specifically towards him is it like they

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,379
were mentioning earlier about the

11
00:00:25,528 --> 00:00:30,240
California Proposition 19

12
00:00:27,379 --> 00:00:33,659
you know if that would passes C then

13
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:35,939
that that that's also inclusive of hemp

14
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:37,738
yeah it is you know so there's kind of a

15
00:00:35,939 --> 00:00:40,320
major thing kind of happening around

16
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:42,390
that part of it but anyways doesn't say

17
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,799
but so about the hemp thing what the

18
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:46,700
only I would add is you know it's like

19
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:51,198
we can

20
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:53,910
the people that really are seriously

21
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:55,649
environmentally oriented I think that

22
00:00:53,909 --> 00:00:57,929
there should be serious consideration of

23
00:00:55,649 --> 00:01:00,390
hemp you know I mean isn't it just at

24
00:00:57,929 --> 00:01:02,820
least check it out yeah I check it out

25
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:04,680
rich dense illegal and and then no as

26
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,019
the reason hemp is illegal is because

27
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,729
you know

28
00:01:06,019 --> 00:01:11,459
marijuana was made illegal in the first

29
00:01:08,728 --> 00:01:13,438
place to shut down hemp that's why it

30
00:01:11,459 --> 00:01:15,780
was made illegal they went after him

31
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:17,489
through marijuana when the marijuana is

32
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,379
starting to come back in so now bring

33
00:01:17,489 --> 00:01:21,149
him back in the same way they went after

34
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:23,938
it let's bring it back in that way but

35
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:25,500
the marijuana prohibition had everything

36
00:01:23,938 --> 00:01:27,809
that it didn't have anything to do with

37
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:30,269
getting high on pot had everything to do

38
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:32,310
with hemp cutting down the forests and

39
00:01:30,269 --> 00:01:34,140
the petrochemical now going to the oil

40
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:37,680
stuff all of this had fallen into place

41
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:39,868
you know so yeah but anyway so I need

42
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,909
people that are seriously considering

43
00:01:39,868 --> 00:01:43,438
about being environmentalist and then

44
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:45,600
I'm not challenging Inc they're doing

45
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:47,849
I'm just saying hey if you're for real

46
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:50,578
about the environment this is earth

47
00:01:47,849 --> 00:01:52,559
medicine it's renewable it's earth

48
00:01:50,578 --> 00:01:54,959
medicine you know and it just plain and

49
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,310
simply is to the medical marijuana

50
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:57,718
people let's say alright well we went

51
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:59,850
and we're getting the medicine for

52
00:01:57,718 --> 00:02:01,589
ourselves now let's come back and get it

53
00:01:59,849 --> 00:02:03,239
for the earth because you know is the

54
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:04,829
one is giving us our medicine in the

55
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:06,868
first place but see I'm saying out of

56
00:02:04,828 --> 00:02:09,508
all of this and out of the hemp

57
00:02:06,868 --> 00:02:12,039
marijuana be we should be the ones that

58
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:14,579
show our dedicated loyalty to the earth

59
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:18,039
all right and and HAMP is

60
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:20,290
yeah I mean it's really anyway you know

61
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:21,459
it's you it's productive and it doesn't

62
00:02:20,289 --> 00:02:23,139
harm the Earth's you don't need the

63
00:02:21,459 --> 00:02:27,390
fastest you don't need the chemicals

64
00:02:23,139 --> 00:02:27,389
reality it helps regenerate the soil
