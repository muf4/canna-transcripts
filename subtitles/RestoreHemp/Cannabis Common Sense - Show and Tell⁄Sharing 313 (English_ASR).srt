apply this to the top of the Corn and

82
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:44,560
wart and they'd leave it there for about

83
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:46,199
three or four days and then they'd

84
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,239
remove it and then the corn or wart

85
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:50,000
would just scrape away with your

86
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:50,000
