00:00:33,058 --> 00:00:37,769
friends died in those cells okay

16
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:39,929
everybody here knows somebody who's been

17
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:41,430
arrested for marijuana everybody here

18
00:00:39,929 --> 00:00:43,950
knows somebody who went to jail for

19
00:00:41,429 --> 00:00:45,780
marijuana everybody here knows somebody

20
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:48,300
if you know me you know somebody who

21
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:50,820
knows people who died for marijuana okay

22
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:53,488
over a plant what we're here to do is

23
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:55,590
stop that in Oregon we have legal

24
00:00:53,488 --> 00:00:57,839
medical marijuana we have legal

25
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:59,820
recreational marijuana that's not true

26
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,530
everywhere I always tell people I grew

27
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,689
up in the south I grew up in North

28
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:06,540
Carolina I grew up in a place where you

29
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:08,188
grow tobacco corn liquor still legal and

30
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,720
you can buy things that will kill you it

31
00:01:08,188 --> 00:01:11,250
just about every drug store in just

32
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:12,890
about every corner store but you can't

33
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:14,790
buy marijuana there which won't

34
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:16,829
marijuana isn't going to kill anybody

35
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:18,509
the only way that you die from marijuana

36
00:01:16,829 --> 00:01:20,700
is if the government puts you in a cage

37
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:22,700
and you die there or if a hundred pounds

38
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:25,109
of it falls off a truck and smashes you

39
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:28,530
other than that is not going to kill you

40
00:01:25,109 --> 00:01:31,078
that being said I want everyone here to

41
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:33,750
understand there are still ways that you

42
00:01:31,078 --> 00:01:35,789
can be hurt by prohibition you're not

43
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:37,859
exempt from being ticketed you're not

44
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:39,420
exempt from being put in a cage you're

45
00:01:37,859 --> 00:01:42,299
not exempt from any of those things

46
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:44,340
police officers can still arrest you for

47
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:46,290
certain quantities of marijuana they can

48
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:48,600
still arrest you for leaving the state

49
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:50,189
with marijuana that they can still

50
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:52,649
arrest you for being at the post office

51
00:01:50,188 --> 00:01:54,179
of marijuana somebody came to me and

52
00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:55,649
they said hey I need to go drop this

53
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,030
package off and I said what do you have

54
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:58,890
marijuana in your car and I said you're

55
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:00,780
about to go on federal property I don't

56
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:03,000
think that's a very good idea you get

57
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:05,159
caught in the half of half plus of

58
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,379
Oregon that's federal land you get

59
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:09,509
caught on tribal land you get caught on

60
00:02:07,379 --> 00:02:11,340
any place where marijuana hasn't been

61
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:13,259
made legal and they can still put you in

62
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,819
a cage they can still find you they can

63
00:02:13,259 --> 00:02:15,229
still take

64
00:02:13,818 --> 00:02:18,018
way your kids they can still make your

65
00:02:15,229 --> 00:02:21,649
life a living hell okay and so I'm here

66
00:02:18,019 --> 00:02:25,819
to say we're going to stop that that

67
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:29,780
will not happen anymore marijuana will

68
00:02:25,818 --> 00:02:33,169
be legal in our lifetimes in the entire

69
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:35,209
country that is what is going to happen

70
00:02:33,169 --> 00:02:37,188
and it's going to happen because I'm

71
00:02:35,209 --> 00:02:39,049
going to do it and you're going to do it

72
00:02:37,188 --> 00:02:41,000
in anybody who comes to you and says

73
00:02:39,049 --> 00:02:42,709
marijuana shouldn't be legal you need to

74
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,180
look at them you need to stand up you

75
00:02:42,709 --> 00:02:46,489
need to come out of the closet and you

76
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:48,530
need to say marijuana should be legal

77
00:02:46,489 --> 00:02:50,628
marijuana is something I either do or

78
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:52,729
have done or I know someone who's close

79
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:56,688
to me who's done it and if you can do

80
00:02:52,729 --> 00:02:59,090
that it ends prohibition ends and none

81
00:02:56,688 --> 00:03:00,709
of us have to be in cages anymore none

82
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:02,810
of us have to pretend we don't do it

83
00:03:00,709 --> 00:03:04,908
anymore and you know what marijuana

84
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:06,709
doesn't lead to harder things at least

85
00:03:04,908 --> 00:03:09,078
for me marijuana led to the hardest

86
00:03:06,709 --> 00:03:11,030
thing i did was grad school that's going

87
00:03:09,079 --> 00:03:13,579
to have a doctorate because of marijuana

88
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:15,468
marijuana helped me go from a person who

89
00:03:13,579 --> 00:03:17,900
couldn't go to class because I was so

90
00:03:15,468 --> 00:03:20,378
sick I couldn't stand up vomiting at a

91
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:23,719
toilet to a person who runs a business

92
00:03:20,378 --> 00:03:25,848
pays my taxes does what I'm supposed to

93
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:27,739
do is an American citizen takes care of

94
00:03:25,848 --> 00:03:30,318
my family takes care of my friends and

95
00:03:27,739 --> 00:03:32,269
we can do that together and if you want

96
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:34,188
to do that support marijuana

97
00:03:32,269 --> 00:03:35,810
legalization not only here in Oregon

98
00:03:34,188 --> 00:03:37,728
support marijuana legalization

99
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:39,680
everywhere in this country and support

100
00:03:37,729 --> 00:03:43,269
