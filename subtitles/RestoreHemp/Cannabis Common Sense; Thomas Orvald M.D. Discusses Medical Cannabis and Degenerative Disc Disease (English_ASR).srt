1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,080
um i think i think it's reasonable to

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:07,199
talk about the

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:10,000
uh malady that

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,000
most of our our patients uh are

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,199
complaining of in the clinic

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,879
and that is uh back pain now there are a

7
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:20,640
lot of reasons for back pain but

8
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:23,919
by far the most frequent uh reason for

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:26,719
discomfort is degenerative disc

10
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,000
disease now you all know that at one

11
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:30,239
time

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,159
at least most of us believe that at one

13
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:32,799
time we were swinging in the trees and

14
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,359
we

15
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:36,320
ultimately came down and stood up on our

16
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:40,159
hind legs

17
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:43,200
and this was one of the problems that

18
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:46,799
encountered the problem with

19
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,320
disc problems if you stand in a vertical

20
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:50,479
position you have

21
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,079
vertebral bodies that have shock

22
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:53,839
absorbers between them

23
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,679
which are called discs and i'll just

24
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:59,520
write i'll

25
00:00:55,679 --> 00:01:03,519
show you a little bit of a diagram here

26
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:06,799
these are vertebral bodies

27
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:10,799
and in between the vertebral bodies as

28
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,799
shock absorbers we have discs

29
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:16,640
and you this is just uh

30
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,799
gives you an idea of what our problems

31
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,920
are

32
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:23,118
now the discs are as we said shock

33
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,000
absorbers

34
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:27,680
they are very thick and fibrous around

35
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,280
the periphery

36
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,320
and very tough but as time goes on as we

37
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,759
age

38
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:38,319
we start to have degenerative problems

39
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,280
in the disc this is a disc looking down

40
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:43,118
on it

41
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:46,239
the outside is fibrous tissue the inside

42
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:50,078
strangely enough is gelatinous

43
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:53,438
so it's like jello

44
00:01:50,078 --> 00:01:57,519
now what happens to these discs as they

45
00:01:53,438 --> 00:02:00,959
degenerate is in some cases

46
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:04,239
they get a weak spot and they bulge

47
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:07,438
when they bulge they have a tendency

48
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:09,840
to cause pressure on nerves that

49
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:11,359
originate from this area and it can

50
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,640
cause

51
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:17,760
pain the other problem is when

52
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:20,238
one of these ruptures it actually

53
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:22,079
breaks open and this gelatinous material

54
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:25,680
is forced out

55
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,640
and sits outside in this area and once

56
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,719
again

57
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:34,159
causes pressure on these nerve roots

58
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:37,039
so this is the thing that we see with

59
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:38,079
most frequency and there are many ways

60
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:41,598
of treating this

61
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:45,040
i because i am surgically oriented

62
00:02:41,598 --> 00:02:47,039
i am most happy

63
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:48,560
with a surgical approach but it's not

64
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:51,679
always possible

65
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:54,800
so today we can treat them surgically

66
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:59,200
we can treat them with some injections

67
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:02,159
of lidocaine or material that will

68
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:02,958
decrease pain but we end up most of the

69
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:07,280
time

70
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:10,239
using our proverbial cannabis

71
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,360
and cannabis helps these people

72
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,560
incredibly

73
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:16,560
with handling their discomfort and once

74
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,000
again this is the thing that we see with

75
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,239
most frequency

76
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,400
in our clinics all right thank you thank

77
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,400
you
