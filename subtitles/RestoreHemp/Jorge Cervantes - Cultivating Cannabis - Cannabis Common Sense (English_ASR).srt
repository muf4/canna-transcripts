1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,028
cannabis grower and I have a question

2
00:00:02,609 --> 00:00:08,820
for George we are having a problem and

3
00:00:06,028 --> 00:00:11,009
curing our cannabis to where we're

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:13,980
trying to find a fine line between not

5
00:00:11,009 --> 00:00:16,740
letting it mold but yet letting it get

6
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:19,500
too dry we keep them in the glass jars

7
00:00:16,739 --> 00:00:22,829
and we do burp the glass stars because

8
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:24,629
we have had some that did mold and so to

9
00:00:22,829 --> 00:00:27,209
prevent the molding you know we are

10
00:00:24,629 --> 00:00:29,969
burping the jars but then we find that

11
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:33,299
if we burp the jars too much that it's

12
00:00:29,969 --> 00:00:36,869
getting too dry so I was wondering if he

13
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:38,609
had any suggestions yeah you probably

14
00:00:36,869 --> 00:00:41,099
have mold on it it's probably got mold

15
00:00:38,609 --> 00:00:43,229
before it goes into the jar and

16
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,808
generally what happens you probably have

17
00:00:43,229 --> 00:00:49,619
some kinds of mildew the big one is the

18
00:00:45,808 --> 00:00:52,919
powdery mildew and it botrytis isn't so

19
00:00:49,619 --> 00:00:56,609
bad but that's botrytis sanara but you

20
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:58,439
can have a this powdery mildew and this

21
00:00:56,609 --> 00:01:00,840
year it's been horrid we have one year

22
00:00:58,439 --> 00:01:03,329
in Spain where it was horrid two years

23
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,189
and now it's not so bad you have to

24
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:07,260
start controlling it early on because

25
00:01:05,188 --> 00:01:10,319
it's a systemic thing and it could start

26
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:12,810
in your plants already right and you

27
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:15,149
have to kill it before it gets in if you

28
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:18,950
want to do it organically because

29
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:21,540
there's a what is the bacillus subtilis

30
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:24,060
is just one of the Pasillas you know

31
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:26,250
bacterias and serenades one of the

32
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:28,320
products that they use right and you

33
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:31,349
have to put that on your plant before

34
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:33,868
the mold comes and then you have to keep

35
00:01:31,349 --> 00:01:36,929
that up before the mold comes and then

36
00:01:33,868 --> 00:01:39,269
after that I you know keep mold other

37
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:41,909
plants that are molding away because

38
00:01:39,269 --> 00:01:44,340
this year it was horrid everything had

39
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:45,868
planned a mold I have crape myrtles

40
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:48,960
where I was growing this year in

41
00:01:45,868 --> 00:01:50,700
California and they had it my plants got

42
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:52,798
it I kept ahead of it on some of them

43
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:55,280
did an experiment experiment on the

44
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:58,290
others and they didn't look too well uh

45
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,420
but anyway there's that point you start

46
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:03,420
there and then after that when you

47
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:05,040
harvest the plants you take all the

48
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:08,550
branches you know and you put them in a

49
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:12,159
bucket of a container like this full of

50
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:16,360
water with like say a two percent of

51
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:20,259
a solution of hydrogen peroxide rich in

52
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:21,760
peroxide yeah h2o2 and then you soak

53
00:02:20,259 --> 00:02:23,679
them in there for a while it sounds kind

54
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:26,319
of funny when you soak them in there the

55
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,659
mold floats up to the top you skim that

56
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:30,849
off might take a couple of times and

57
00:02:28,659 --> 00:02:33,069
then you skim that off and then you take

58
00:02:30,849 --> 00:02:36,340
your plants and you lightly spray them

59
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:38,319
with water with water I don't know

60
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:40,000
exactly what it does to the trichomes it

61
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:42,129
may beat them a little bit but i would

62
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,810
use like a light spray not heavy spray

63
00:02:42,129 --> 00:02:46,030
just to kind of rinse it off and then

64
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:48,340
you shake that and then you let it dry

65
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:51,629
or you can put it in a harvesting

66
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:54,520
machine or I mean a trimming machine but

67
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:57,189
then then you could put it into your

68
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:59,500
container you know but what that the

69
00:02:57,189 --> 00:03:01,180
second control alloria gave was you know

70
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:04,419
when it had mold on it already and that

71
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:07,480
stuff it's hard to see you know once you

72
00:03:04,419 --> 00:03:10,869
see it it's there it's inside the plant

73
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:13,119
you can't change that so one of the

74
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:14,469
things I've been playing with I was

75
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,330
planned with one of those green lights

76
00:03:14,469 --> 00:03:19,209
you know you put on your head and walk

77
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:21,730
around in the green in the row room with

78
00:03:19,209 --> 00:03:25,240
we were filming in a I'm doing a lot of

79
00:03:21,729 --> 00:03:26,649
videos now and we were filming in a grow

80
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:29,830
room and I was looking around with this

81
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:32,590
green light and you can see the mold it

82
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:35,760
sticks out yeah and so the next thing

83
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:39,430
I'm going to do is get the UV see light

84
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:41,049
not UVB but UVC it'll burn your eyes but

85
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:43,330
you can shine it on the mold and it'll

86
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:45,370
kill it right on the plant you know so

87
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:48,760
that's a big tip please pay attention

88
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:50,259
yes there you go no master himself hey

89
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:53,370
here's what something I'd like to say I

90
00:03:50,259 --> 00:03:56,469
just came from dinner with my friend

91
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:58,830
Jeff who wrote this book teeming with

92
00:03:56,469 --> 00:04:01,449
microbes and it's an excellent book

93
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:05,320
wonderful book it's all about growing

94
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:07,899
organically you put a good biology with

95
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:09,879
your soil and you're going to grow a lot

96
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:12,390
bigger plants you're going to have way

97
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:15,909
fewer problems you're not going to have

98
00:04:12,389 --> 00:04:17,918
gosh all of these invasions to the roots

99
00:04:15,909 --> 00:04:20,079
and everything the money the the

100
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:23,079
microbes will help so much I've been

101
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:26,079
using the micro Sol enzymes for years

102
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:26,490
left that helps the nutrients break down

103
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:29,818
and

104
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:32,340
the roots those what other microbes can

105
00:04:29,819 --> 00:04:34,620
well the thing is the thing is with the

106
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:37,679
microbes they they make the fertilizer

107
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:39,689
the the nutrients that are available and

108
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,610
they make them available in the soil

109
00:04:39,689 --> 00:04:44,098
there's already a lot of things in the

110
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:46,590
soil that just are not available to make

111
00:04:44,098 --> 00:04:49,529
it available is a big thing just because

112
00:04:46,589 --> 00:04:52,859
something has a big in PK number you

113
00:04:49,529 --> 00:04:55,168
know like 10 20 30 or whatever on the on

114
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:57,360
the label doesn't mean that the plant is

115
00:04:55,168 --> 00:05:00,299
going to use it that plant it doesn't

116
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,970
use that always or uses a fraction of it

117
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:06,900
the main thing is to get the the stuff

118
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:10,620
used and anyway like I say give this a

119
00:05:06,899 --> 00:05:12,359
shot and you'll be much happier and the

120
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:14,519
other thing is to you know people spend

121
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:17,490
a lot for fertilizers and stuff it's not

122
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:20,549
necessary you can you can grow a

123
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:24,538
10-pound plant in a 200 gallon container

124
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:27,030
with good soil and for further for your

125
00:05:24,538 --> 00:05:29,399
flowering fertilizer you have two hands

126
00:05:27,029 --> 00:05:31,379
two hands like this full of bat guano

127
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:33,538
should have gloves on because because

128
00:05:31,379 --> 00:05:36,089
it's poop it's not good but you throw

129
00:05:33,538 --> 00:05:37,439
that on there and that's it that's all

130
00:05:36,089 --> 00:05:40,679
you have to give for the whole year

131
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:43,228
that's it you know so um if you feel

132
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:45,718
your head with good things you don't

133
00:05:43,228 --> 00:05:48,930
have to put too much on your plants it's

134
00:05:45,718 --> 00:05:50,668
a very good thing very good point the

135
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:52,348
big plant video that you produced you're

136
00:05:50,668 --> 00:05:55,109
working on some others now you got that

137
00:05:52,348 --> 00:05:57,180
one out there on how the best way to do

138
00:05:55,110 --> 00:06:01,860
that i know i'm gearing up right now to

139
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:03,629
make my cuttings for this this april and

140
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:05,669
excellent you know i always try to make

141
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:08,009
them right around the first a year so

142
00:06:05,668 --> 00:06:10,620
they're they're good three to five feet

143
00:06:08,009 --> 00:06:12,180
tall when they go in in April you know

144
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:14,399
that's that's what you have to remember

145
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:17,189
this plants really really easy to grow

146
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:19,468
you know some people call it a weed it

147
00:06:17,189 --> 00:06:22,288
grows everywhere you know everywhere

148
00:06:19,468 --> 00:06:26,098
there's a memory how we grow too yeah

149
00:06:22,288 --> 00:06:28,468
exactly huge 24 plants in an area and

150
00:06:26,098 --> 00:06:31,319
it's just jam-packed and so now I cut it

151
00:06:28,468 --> 00:06:34,168
back to nine I've seen you know three

152
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:36,810
plants fill a 60 x 30 greenhouse yes yes

153
00:06:34,168 --> 00:06:39,299
yeah then totally possible there's

154
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:40,050
people are growing plants you know 20 20

155
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,908
pounds

156
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:44,009
you know it's very very possible it's

157
00:06:41,908 --> 00:06:46,709
not that difficult the main thing is is

158
00:06:44,009 --> 00:06:48,810
it takes time for it to grow that big

159
00:06:46,709 --> 00:06:50,908
you know if it doesn't have time you

160
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:52,769
know the plants indoors they can grow a

161
00:06:50,908 --> 00:06:55,199
meter high and that's it because the

162
00:06:52,769 --> 00:06:57,628
light is limited and the pot is limiting

163
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:00,210
but when you have a plant that's that

164
00:06:57,629 --> 00:07:02,759
has plenty of soil and there's time for

165
00:07:00,209 --> 00:07:05,158
the biology to take place in the soil

166
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:07,800
for the for the roots to absorb

167
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:10,800
everything you're going to have a lot

168
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:13,199
bigger plant and like I say you're

169
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,598
taking your cuttings uh right after

170
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,009
Christmas first of the year that's what

171
00:07:15,598 --> 00:07:19,529
you should be doing and you're growing

172
00:07:17,009 --> 00:07:21,180
cuttings to you know I mean and but the

173
00:07:19,529 --> 00:07:23,878
thing is your cuttings have been

174
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:27,449
acclimated acclimated to this climate

175
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:30,509
this is a sunset western garden bug zone

176
00:07:27,449 --> 00:07:34,169
eight on eight a or B I can't remember

177
00:07:30,509 --> 00:07:36,538
but uh you know that means the last

178
00:07:34,168 --> 00:07:40,228
average day of frost is April fifteenth

179
00:07:36,538 --> 00:07:42,658
I things okay so I'm in zone 14 where

180
00:07:40,228 --> 00:07:45,149
I'm at in California right now I can

181
00:07:42,658 --> 00:07:46,918
start a bit earlier but the main thing

182
00:07:45,149 --> 00:07:49,408
is you could put these plants outside

183
00:07:46,918 --> 00:07:50,758
you got to keep them from flowering so

184
00:07:49,408 --> 00:07:53,278
that means they're going to need a

185
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:55,439
little light to keep it from flowering

186
00:07:53,278 --> 00:07:57,449
because you know it's a day light

187
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:59,189
sensitive plant but the other thing is

188
00:07:57,449 --> 00:08:01,319
they're going to need heat and that's

189
00:07:59,189 --> 00:08:03,750
about it it can be raining cats and dogs

190
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:05,848
outside as long as they're warm enough

191
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:07,978
they're going to grow yeah and they

192
00:08:05,848 --> 00:08:10,129
don't need tons light early on in the

193
00:08:07,978 --> 00:08:10,129
year
