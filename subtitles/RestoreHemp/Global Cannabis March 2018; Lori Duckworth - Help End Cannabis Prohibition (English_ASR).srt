1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,878
and we're offset is true it's about

2
00:00:02,279 --> 00:00:08,820
family it's about getting people out of

3
00:00:05,878 --> 00:00:14,129
cages and I was almost one of those

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:16,800
people i sat in a cage for seven days

5
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:21,359

yeah that's what we heard a year later

14
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:59,609
when we were due to go to trial we had

15
00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:01,350
some really fine attorneys you've heard

16
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:04,769
Leland Berger speak here today he

17
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:06,650

was my attorney

19
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:11,790
we took a plea bargain in all of the 29

20
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:14,250
and 28 felonies were dropped against

21
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:18,330
myself and my husband in exchange for

22
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:20,599
one Class B felony the charge was

23
00:01:18,329 --> 00:01:22,920
delivery of more than one ounce of

24
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:26,309
cannabis to another medical marijuana

25
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:29,280
card holder for no consideration and

26
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:31,740
there was no such charge that was a made

27
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,799
up charge to get those felonies to go

28
00:01:31,739 --> 00:01:36,868
away

29
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:39,240
fast-forward to three years - felonies

30
00:01:36,868 --> 00:01:41,790
been expunged as part of that plea

31
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:43,798
bargain our guns and ammunition we're

32
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:47,009
returned and that was also a first in

33
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:48,810
the state of Oregon I continued to lobby

34
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:51,030
with compassion at Oregon and you've

35
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:53,579
heard the Anthony Taylor and a couple of

36
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:55,950
other people talk about that today and

37
00:01:53,578 --> 00:01:58,309
in now the five years since that

38
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:03,950
happened we've done things like

39
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:03,950
qualified PTSD as a qualifying condition

40
00:02:04,218 --> 00:02:09,000
we didn't just do that for our veterans

41
00:02:06,989 --> 00:02:12,799
we did that for people like myself who

42
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,389
suffered from childhood traumas

43
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:20,010
for women who've been raped

44
00:02:15,389 --> 00:02:24,149
that's a trauma for children that have

45
00:02:20,009 --> 00:02:25,949
been beat sexually molested women who

46
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:28,770
have lived with domestic violence

47
00:02:25,949 --> 00:02:38,099
all of those are PTSD and you all now

48
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:41,850
qualify under the LM MA if you receive

49
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:43,769
Oregon Health Plan or food stamps you

50
00:02:41,849 --> 00:02:46,019
now only pay fifty and sixty dollars

51
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:49,700
instead of two hundred we did that

52
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:52,170
compassionate Oregon did that and

53
00:02:49,699 --> 00:02:54,030
veterans you only pay twenty dollars for

54
00:02:52,169 --> 00:03:01,709
your application fee instead of two

55
00:02:54,030 --> 00:03:03,599
hundred we did that if you want the

56
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:05,159
program to stick around you want to keep

57
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:08,849
your medical program you better keep

58
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:11,810
your patient card you medical growers

59
00:03:08,849 --> 00:03:14,250
you better keep your medical patients

60
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:16,080
you better convince some of those rent

61
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:21,959
growers to get back on this side of the

62
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:24,840
fence because without a medical program

63
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:28,439
