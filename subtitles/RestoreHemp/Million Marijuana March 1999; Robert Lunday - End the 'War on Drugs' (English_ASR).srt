marching and speaking out against the

16
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:55,679
numerous and justices brought on the

17
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:57,599
American people by the war on drugs we

18
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:59,878
may be the first true people with

19
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,460
differing opinions on the issues but one

20
00:00:59,878 --> 00:01:04,228
thing is common amongst us all the war

21
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:06,210
on drugs has affected the lives of

22
00:01:04,228 --> 00:01:08,069
everyone of us enough so that you're

23
00:01:06,209 --> 00:01:09,779
willing to get in the streets and March

24
00:01:08,069 --> 00:01:13,699
and say that things have got to change

25
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,700
the drug war is wrong

26
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:22,390
we know the drug was wrong because it's

27
00:01:20,109 --> 00:01:25,329
fraught with injustice forfeiture laws

28
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:27,849
are unjust because they allow a home or

29
00:01:25,329 --> 00:01:30,310
car be taken without an individual be to

30
00:01:27,849 --> 00:01:32,679
be charged with a crime mandatory

31
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:35,159
minimums are unjust because there's no

32
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:37,990
room to consider the circumstances that

33
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:40,509
go along with the rest the judge should

34
00:01:37,989 --> 00:01:42,489
have an option the Legislature should

35
00:01:40,509 --> 00:01:42,879
not be saying you go to jail for ten

36
00:01:42,489 --> 00:01:45,759
years

37
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:48,158
because you are related or heard about a

38
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:53,429
drug bust and the cannabis prohibition

39
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:55,990
is unjust our laws are hypocrisy

40
00:01:53,429 --> 00:01:58,629
parla it's hypocrisy that we can drink

41
00:01:55,989 --> 00:01:59,239
alcohol we killed hundreds of people

42
00:01:58,629 --> 00:02:01,829
every year

43
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:04,569
[Applause]

44
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:07,359
it's a [ __ ] receipt you can legally

45
00:02:04,569 --> 00:02:10,989
smoke nicotine and yet it kills hundreds

46
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:13,210
of thousands of people every year and

47
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:15,129
yet I'll stand here is that you have the

48
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:16,960
right to do that you should as a free

49
00:02:15,129 --> 00:02:25,930
American being able to consume nicotine

50
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:28,180
the drink alcohol and smoke pot so

51
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:32,560
what's the result of this unjust war

52
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:35,230
well for example there's a mr. gray who

53
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,699
was the US Marine for five years he went

54
00:02:35,229 --> 00:02:39,310
off and served this country in the Gulf

55
00:02:36,699 --> 00:02:42,159
War he came back with numerous

56
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:45,009
unexplainable illnesses uncontrollable

57
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:48,069
vomiting he went to the VA hospital 20

58
00:02:45,009 --> 00:02:50,379
times they prescribed numerous legal

59
00:02:48,069 --> 00:02:53,109
drugs none of them which could help him

60
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:55,299
so finally he turned like many sufferers

61
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:57,880
of the Gulf War Syndrome due to

62
00:02:55,300 --> 00:03:02,640
marijuana and he found relief and how do

63
00:02:57,879 --> 00:03:02,639
we thank him steal his [ __ ] house

64
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:08,680
[Applause]

65
00:03:06,449 --> 00:03:10,899
another Justice is the Eastside

66
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:13,180
Narcotics Task Force we allow them to

67
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:15,610
engage in terrorist tactics destroying

68
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:19,718
homes and traumatizing children house

69
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:22,819
after house after house that's unjust

70
00:03:19,718 --> 00:03:25,430
I'm just that will foster who grows

71
00:03:22,818 --> 00:03:28,218
marijuana for his own personal medical

72
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:30,640
reason should be sentenced to 93 years

73
00:03:28,218 --> 00:03:30,639
in jail

74
00:03:33,509 --> 00:03:40,019
the trunk more needs to change 80% of

75
00:03:38,098 --> 00:03:41,969
our forfeitures occur where no

76
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:45,090
individual 'its was charged with a crime

77
00:03:41,969 --> 00:03:46,769
I think this is such an injustice and we

78
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:49,229
don't have to look farther than our own

79
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:51,239
law of Washington to see the problems

80
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:53,488
with this law so I'm gonna read the

81
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:56,700
three pillars of the Washington State

82
00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:58,799
forfeiture law tenet number one and this

83
00:03:56,699 --> 00:04:01,768
is in the hip voters guide if you saw

84
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:04,019
this last year number one in cases

85
00:04:01,769 --> 00:04:06,299
involving property personal property the

86
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:07,890
burden of producing evidence shall be

87
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:11,040
upon the person claiming to be the

88
00:04:07,889 --> 00:04:13,199
lawful owner of the property that's you

89
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:15,419
that's not the cops if they plan

90
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:17,310
something to shove you up to you to

91
00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:19,168
prove it if your friend has a joint in

92
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:21,358
your car and they take your car it's

93
00:04:19,168 --> 00:04:23,129
your responsibility to prove it there's

94
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:28,198
no due process in that and there's no

95
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:29,969
justice in that look at the next two

96
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:32,160
corners of the Washington state farm to

97
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:33,539
drill on number two is each seizing

98
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,699
agency sorry meant to the state

99
00:04:33,538 --> 00:04:37,620
treasurer and about equal to ten percent

100
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:41,220
of the net proceeds of any of the

101
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:44,848
property forfeit is what happens to the

102
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:46,770
other ninety percent property and the

103
00:04:44,848 --> 00:04:49,139
net proceeds not required to be paid to

104
00:04:46,769 --> 00:04:52,329
the State Treasurer shall be retained by

105
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:55,160
the seizing law enforcement agency

106
00:04:52,329 --> 00:04:57,569
[Applause]

107
00:04:55,160 --> 00:05:00,900
and as an invitation for corruptness

108
00:04:57,569 --> 00:05:01,829
it's no longer a balanced justice system

109
00:05:00,899 --> 00:05:04,169
that we're supposed to have in the

110
00:05:01,829 --> 00:05:06,909
United States the forfeiture laws and

111
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:11,759
the drug war needs to change

112
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:13,970
[Applause]

113
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,969
