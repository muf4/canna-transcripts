1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:07,040
a disease called glaucoma it's usually a

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:10,320
disease that is caused U uh that is

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:12,519
found in in elderly people and It

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,879
ultimately if it's not treated

5
00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:19,719
appropriately it can lead to blindness

6
00:00:15,878 --> 00:00:22,800
now the the pathology in glaucoma is

7
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:25,640
that there's an Insidious increase in

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,560
pressure within the globe of your eye

9
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:31,719
there is a normal pressure that is

10
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:33,719
acceptable in the eye and there is an

11
00:00:31,719 --> 00:00:36,600
excessive pressure that is accept that

12
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:39,280
is not acceptable on the eye now the eye

13
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,439
this is a crude uh drawing of the eye

14
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,000
this is the

15
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:47,599
cornea this is the globe and here is the

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,960
lens that's on the inside of the eye so

17
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:54,079
light comes in through this area here

18
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:58,239
through the cornea through the lens and

19
00:00:54,079 --> 00:01:01,878
and is focused on the retina and the

20
00:00:58,238 --> 00:01:04,798
retina is a light sensitive uh coating

21
00:01:01,878 --> 00:01:07,879
of the back of the eye here this is

22
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:12,118
where the optic nerve comes in and

23
00:01:07,879 --> 00:01:15,399
supplies fibers to this well in in

24
00:01:12,118 --> 00:01:16,799
glaucoma the pressure goes Sky High

25
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:20,920
within this

26
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:24,520
globe and uh the treatment for glaucoma

27
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:27,359
is to somehow get the pressure down

28
00:01:24,519 --> 00:01:30,840
within the globe it just so happens that

29
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:34,280
one of the many Virtues Of cannabis is

30
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:37,118
that it has the capability of decreasing

31
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:38,560
intraocular pressure and I'll tell you

32
00:01:37,118 --> 00:01:43,359
an interesting

33
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:46,240
story uh years ago when I was uh active

34
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:49,799
in basketball I got stuck in my eye by

35
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:53,679
an index finger and I bled in my globe

36
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:56,159
and five years later I got unilateral

37
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,399
glaucoma well one of my friends is an

38
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:02,560
opthalmologist and has been taking care

39
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:05,718
of this and uh an hour before I went to

40
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:09,118
visit him I took a small amount of

41
00:02:05,718 --> 00:02:11,239
tincture of cannabis I went in to see

42
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:14,719
him an hour later he took the pressures

43
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:18,080
in my eye and they were seven now that

44
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:21,639
is way way down from the pathologic

45
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:24,959
pressure and he said yes my drops are

46
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:28,000
working well it wasn't his drops at all

47
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:31,319
it was the Cannabis so cannabis is a

48
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,318
very effective way you used properly to

49
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:37,518
decrease the pressure within the eye and

50
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:40,399
to preserve this

51
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:43,200
wonderful retina back here that

52
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:46,480
transcribes all the visual sites into

53
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:48,759
the brain so come to see us if uh you

54
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:51,560
need to have some help with the

55
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:54,560
management of your

56
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,560
glaucoma
