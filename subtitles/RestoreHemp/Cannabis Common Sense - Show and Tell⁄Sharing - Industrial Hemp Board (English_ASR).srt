1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:05,960
okay this is uh this is one of the

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:08,719
original uh pieces of hemp uh this is

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:11,160
medium density fiber board it was made

4
00:00:08,718 --> 00:00:13,558
out of hemp that was grown in Spain

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:16,679
imported through France uh we imported

6
00:00:13,558 --> 00:00:18,439
this I think in 1992 we imported a bail

7
00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:21,920
through CNS specialty Builder Supply

8
00:00:18,439 --> 00:00:24,320
Bill Ki David seber Barry uh Davis I was

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,519
on the board of directors there uh we

10
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,679
had to discover what we could do to use

11
00:00:26,518 --> 00:00:30,839
this and so we had this bail of hemp

12
00:00:28,678 --> 00:00:32,960
that we had to bring in through the DEA

13
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:35,759
and uh uh we had to prove that there was

14
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,719
no THC in it whatsoever and we were able

15
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:40,079
to do that so now we got the hemp and

16
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:42,840
now we have to discover what is it that

17
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:46,399
you do with a ba hemp to turn it into a

18
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:49,760
actual real live board and studies said

19
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:52,079
that that is stronger than steel this is

20
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:53,719
uh what we did when when we we had to

21
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:57,039
actually go through all of this standard

22
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:59,600
industry tests for this and uh for this

23
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:02,439
board uh and what we discovered was that

24
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:05,239
it met or surpassed every standard in

25
00:01:02,439 --> 00:01:07,359
the industry and so it's Mo the modulus

26
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:11,079
of rupture on this is something like

27
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:13,079
1,500 which is 10 times average and so

28
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:14,879
when we had it tested on CNN because we

29
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:18,280
actually did have this tested on CNN it

30
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:21,078
broke the machine that tests things like

31
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:23,118
this there was you know so it we had we

32
00:01:21,078 --> 00:01:25,039
we discovered all kinds of fanciful

33
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:27,280
things that you can do with him from an

34
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,000
industrial standpoint and so this is

35
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,560
when in my archives and you always have

36
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,920
showand tell down here here Paul and so

37
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,439
I I'm glad you brought that in I I I'd

38
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,960
bring a piece of History this is

39
00:01:34,438 --> 00:01:38,118
actually one of the very first hint

40
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:40,359
boards ever made and I was on the board

41
00:01:38,118 --> 00:01:43,280
of directors and I actually discovered

42
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:45,039
how it was that we could cut this up in

43
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,718
order to make it turn it into boards

44
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,159
because when we sent it to Washington

45
00:01:46,718 --> 00:01:50,559
State and we discovered we they were

46
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:53,520
using long fibers and they put it

47
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,439
through their their fiber masher and at

48
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:58,879
Washington State University have a the

49
00:01:55,438 --> 00:02:01,239
best the most uh Advanced composite uh

50
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:03,000
Manufacturing research and development

51
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:05,000
facility in the world it was funded by

52
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,959
the United States government but yeah it

53
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,959
was after World War II they they funded

54
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:10,799
that and so that's where we took it to

55
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,239
have them uh test the fibers and when

56
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,439
they put all those fibers into the

57
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,759
machine it froze the machine up in just

58
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:18,639
a few seconds and and they'd never had

59
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:20,359
anything do that to their machine before

60
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:21,919
rather than be upset they were rather

61
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,720
excited because they'd never had

62
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:25,559
anything do that before and they wanted

63
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:28,359
to know what this stuff was all about

64
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,959
and so we went on to uh several year

65
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:33,720
research and development uh process and

66
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:36,000
I believe that if you ever wanted to to

67
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:38,359
uh uh license this you could go to

68
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,400
Washington State University and and

69
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:42,720
purchase the license because they own

70
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,360
the license for this and and uh uh you

71
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:46,840
could learn how to make it and the

72
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:49,920
formula is available simple as that it's

73
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,920
it's out there
