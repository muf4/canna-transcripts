1
00:00:04,549 --> 00:00:10,109
the books credibility got a boost from

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:13,919
Jack's discovery of this 14 minute

3
00:00:10,109 --> 00:00:16,439
documentary supposedly made by the US

4
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:19,528
government five years after the

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:22,260
marihuana Tax Act its purpose was to

6
00:00:19,528 --> 00:00:25,980
encourage farmers to grow outlawed hemp

7
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:28,320
during World War two long ago when these

8
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:30,118
ancient Grecian temples were new hemp

9
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:34,140
was already old in the service of

10
00:00:30,118 --> 00:00:37,079
mankind for thousands of years even then

11
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:39,179
this plant had been grown for cordage

12
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:42,600
and coarse cloth in China and elsewhere

13
00:00:39,179 --> 00:00:44,369
in the East but now with Philippine and

14
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,620
East Indian sources of hemp in the hands

15
00:00:44,369 --> 00:00:49,378
of the Japanese and shipment of jute

16
00:00:46,619 --> 00:00:51,359
from India curtailed American hemp must

17
00:00:49,378 --> 00:00:54,479
meet the needs of our army and navy as

18
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:55,948
well as of our industries in 1942

19
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:59,038
patriotic farmers at the government's

20
00:00:55,948 --> 00:01:01,170
request planted 36,000 acres of seed

21
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:04,530
hemp an increase of several thousand

22
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:07,109
percent the goal for 1943 is 50,000

23
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:08,849
acres of seed hemp for to grow hemp

24
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:11,819
legally you must have a federal

25
00:01:08,849 --> 00:01:14,728
registration and tax stamp this is

26
00:01:11,819 --> 00:01:16,949
provided for in your contract ask your

27
00:01:14,728 --> 00:01:20,908
triple a committeeman for your County

28
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:23,189
agent about it don't forget Jack often

29
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:25,618
staged public showings of hemp for

30
00:01:23,188 --> 00:01:28,649
victory to validate his history of the

31
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:30,688
plant he also used the film as an

32
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:33,960
example of government deception and

33
00:01:30,688 --> 00:01:36,599
hypocrisy but he was stunned one day in

34
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:39,899
1988 to get a call from a newspaper

35
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:43,408
reporter questioning the authenticity of

36
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:47,570
the film while the Sahara we went out to

37
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:50,570
check the information and we found

38
00:01:47,569 --> 00:01:55,798
nobody that would corroborate your story

39
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:57,478
that this movie was even ever made you

40
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:58,860
said this movie was made by the United

41
00:01:57,478 --> 00:02:01,489
States government this movie hemp for

42
00:01:58,859 --> 00:02:03,959
victory that if there would be any

43
00:02:01,489 --> 00:02:06,269
evidence that the government ever made

44
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:07,199
such a film it would be in the library

45
00:02:06,269 --> 00:02:09,030
of congress

46
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,598
be in the Department of Agriculture it

47
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:15,659
is in neither place here's a reputation

48
00:02:12,598 --> 00:02:24,329
on the line Jack and his friends went on

49
00:02:15,659 --> 00:02:25,560
an excursion to Washington DC we were

50
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:28,370
just determined to find the

51
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,659
documentation that made it a credible

52
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:34,069
government movie made by the US

53
00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:34,068
government not made by Jack

54
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:40,719
we didn't see it as detective work we

55
00:02:39,128 --> 00:02:44,348
just saw it as we were on a mission

56
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:46,598
we're on a mission from God many others

57
00:02:44,348 --> 00:02:48,759
before Jack had searched the Library of

58
00:02:46,598 --> 00:02:52,329
Congress for proof of the documentaries

59
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:55,000
existence and found none in a day of

60
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:59,680
digging Jack ran into the same lack of

61
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:02,799
evidence after deciding to give up we

62
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:06,099
decided to give it one more try in a

63
00:03:02,799 --> 00:03:09,519
dusty old book hidden among clutter in a

64
00:03:06,098 --> 00:03:13,419
back room they found it the official

65
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:16,209
Library of Congress documentation indeed

66
00:03:13,419 --> 00:03:19,089
the film had been made by the US

67
00:03:16,209 --> 00:03:21,150
Department of Agriculture hemp for

68
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:21,150
victory

69
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:35,939
you
