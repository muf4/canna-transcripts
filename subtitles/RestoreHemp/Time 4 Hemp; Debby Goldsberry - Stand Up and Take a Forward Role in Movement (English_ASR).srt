1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,779
joining us on the program is Debbie

2
00:00:01,949 --> 00:00:06,809
goldsberry who's the co-founder the cab

3
00:00:03,779 --> 00:00:09,570
cannabis Action Network acronym can

4
00:00:06,809 --> 00:00:12,178
welcome to our show what is Ken all

5
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:13,370
about well cannabis action network is

6
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:16,589
what's called an unincorporated

7
00:00:13,369 --> 00:00:18,089
association where a charity were a group

8
00:00:16,589 --> 00:00:20,820
of people who have got together for a

9
00:00:18,089 --> 00:00:24,570
common cause our cause or our goal is to

10
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:25,948
legalize cannabis okay now I've noticed

11
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:27,480
from being involved with the hemp

12
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:29,220
movement that it's not always that the

13
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,240
ladies seem to want to speak up or

14
00:00:29,219 --> 00:00:32,609
they're not half there in the front

15
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:34,920
lines you are a good example someone

16
00:00:32,609 --> 00:00:36,629
who's not intimidated by being out there

17
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,149
I think they're afraid for their

18
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:40,469
children I think they're afraid of the

19
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:42,058
repercussions that can happen in their

20
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:44,879
professional lives how do you do with

21
00:00:42,058 --> 00:00:47,369
that let's see well I don't have

22
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:49,738
children that's easy professional life

23
00:00:47,369 --> 00:00:51,269
no that's animal activist and what do

24
00:00:49,738 --> 00:00:52,919
you tell you speak yeah um well

25
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:54,809
basically I think what it is it's a

26
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:57,059
difference between the way that male and

27
00:00:54,808 --> 00:00:59,939
female are socialized in our country of

28
00:00:57,058 --> 00:01:02,968
females are literally socialized to be

29
00:00:59,939 --> 00:01:05,338
more in the background we find in the

30
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:07,170
marijuana movement what's going on that

31
00:01:05,338 --> 00:01:09,629
when females do join the movement

32
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:10,799
they're working behind a table or

33
00:01:09,629 --> 00:01:12,719
they're in some sort of a supportive

34
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,340
role usually they choose that position

35
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:16,618
because that's where would feel more

36
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:18,000
comfortable when a woman actually does

37
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:21,299
step forward there is a lot of

38
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,680
discrimination it have its not

39
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:23,880
discrimination solely within the

40
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,740
marijuana movement the whole entire

41
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:28,140
country if not the entire world however

42
00:01:25,739 --> 00:01:29,519
that works but there is a lot within the

43
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:31,079
marijuana movement and that's like

44
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:33,509
everyone says there's a lot of

45
00:01:31,078 --> 00:01:35,429
middle-aged men involved a lot of it is

46
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:37,019
the Washington DC political scene it's

47
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:39,720
been like this year for hundreds of

48
00:01:37,019 --> 00:01:41,250
years okay um as far as getting more

49
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:43,289
people involved i think it's important

50
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:44,938
for women who are involved to stand up

51
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:47,490
and take a forward roll in a movement

52
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:49,258
that's what we're all about occasionally

53
00:01:47,489 --> 00:01:51,359
i fear the reference the girls who can

54
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:53,879
the ladies that can sew and your

55
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:55,590
co-founder who else found put this

56
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:57,030
together with you let's see well the

57
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:59,060
cannabis Action Network wasn't actually

58
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:01,609
founded by all women or

59
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:03,140
girls what it started out with it was a

60
00:02:01,609 --> 00:02:05,478
group of college students around the

61
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:08,868
state of Illinois along with national

62
00:02:05,478 --> 00:02:10,610
normal in Wisconsin normal in the long

63
00:02:08,868 --> 00:02:13,340
run when it came down to it after we

64
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:14,780
gone through a couple years let's see

65
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:16,069
what we didn't actually start can right

66
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:18,680
away i should say we started the him

67
00:02:16,068 --> 00:02:20,629
tour project on cannabis action network

68
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,610
came after about a year a year of him

69
00:02:20,629 --> 00:02:24,680
tours after we decided that we did need

70
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:26,150
to start some sort of a movement at that

71
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:29,480
time a group of us i guess you could say

72
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:30,920
friends got together a girl who were

73
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:34,159
friends and we started a national

74
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:36,199
organization so that's how now uteri

75
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:38,030
know from reading in High Times Magazine

76
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:40,579
I've been an association of course with

77
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:41,930
the hemp organization Anza you do go

78
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:44,080
coast to coast and you've had the

79
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:46,700
opportunity to see firsthand the

80
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,380
enthusiasm or lack of enthusiasm towards

81
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:50,030
the hip movement how strong of a body do

82
00:02:48,379 --> 00:02:52,189
you think we have I think we have a very

83
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:53,870
strong body about enthusiastic

84
00:02:52,189 --> 00:02:56,269
supporters out there what we found when

85
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:59,390
we go across the country it pretty much

86
00:02:56,269 --> 00:03:01,400
goes with the marijuana laws in a place

87
00:02:59,389 --> 00:03:03,619
like New York City or a state where

88
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,689
there's the decriminalization you know

89
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:07,969
just criminalisation law we don't get as

90
00:03:05,689 --> 00:03:10,939
much support in a place where there's a

91
00:03:07,969 --> 00:03:13,759
lot of harsh laws a lot of police

92
00:03:10,939 --> 00:03:15,620
intimidation on we get a lot of support

93
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:17,719
basically what's happened is that the

94
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:20,030
more the government fights against us

95
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:21,259
the more that we the users the cannabis

96
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:24,469
supporters realize that we have to get

97
00:03:21,259 --> 00:03:26,449
together and work three guys okay now

98
00:03:24,469 --> 00:03:28,789
when you raise your voice in society you

99
00:03:26,449 --> 00:03:30,828
raise it with strength and pride but a

100
00:03:28,789 --> 00:03:33,048
lot of people still aren't being able to

101
00:03:30,829 --> 00:03:34,849
have the opportunity to hear now do you

102
00:03:33,049 --> 00:03:36,889
continue you kind of continue with hemp

103
00:03:34,849 --> 00:03:39,620
tears and so how do you plan to continue

104
00:03:36,889 --> 00:03:40,880
to promote them well the the way they

105
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:42,500
haven't or works is it has a couple

106
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,599
different levels it starts off at the

107
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:46,189
beginning level the beginning level is

108
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:47,900
to get our activists to find the people

109
00:03:46,189 --> 00:03:49,609
who are interested in legalizing the

110
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:52,159
activist supporters who can carry on

111
00:03:49,609 --> 00:03:53,959
bigger and better projects usually takes

112
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:56,389
a couple years in any given area to get

113
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:58,459
a good solid core of activists after

114
00:03:56,389 --> 00:04:00,680
that we take we change the platform

115
00:03:58,459 --> 00:04:02,719
instead of finding our activists what we

116
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:04,040
do is we want to educate the public we

117
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:05,789
would call that an eight or remain

118
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:08,578
focused or we bring along a national

119
00:04:05,789 --> 00:04:10,650
speaker like jack herer lv music in the

120
00:04:08,579 --> 00:04:12,150
medical marijuana patient that's the

121
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:14,459
point that we're at right now doing our

122
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:16,590
aid tours educational forums to reach

123
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:20,060
out into the public that false things

124
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:22,769
like debates and lectures public forums

125
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:25,829
after that Nets point threat right now

126
00:04:22,769 --> 00:04:27,839
after this we plan on developing a new

127
00:04:25,829 --> 00:04:30,060
strategy how do we get bigger how do we

128
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:31,859
get better our goal right now is to have

129
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:33,389
statewide conferences in every state get

130
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:36,150
the organizers together to meet at

131
00:04:33,389 --> 00:04:38,490
roundtable discussions and to form or a

132
00:04:36,149 --> 00:04:42,239
more direct political agenda lobbying

133
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:45,030
direct demonstration type of things ok

134
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,860
now you stamina Lexington Kentucky are

135
00:04:45,029 --> 00:04:49,258
there chapters or other can

136
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:51,000
organizations across America that people

137
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:52,949
can contact to there are can

138
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,598
organizations cannabis Action Network is

139
00:04:52,949 --> 00:04:56,129
not a membership organization it's a

140
00:04:54,598 --> 00:04:59,129
network of organizations across the

141
00:04:56,129 --> 00:05:00,449
country and activists involved in the

142
00:04:59,129 --> 00:05:03,930
network we have about 200 organizations

143
00:05:00,449 --> 00:05:07,169
it has grown exponentially two years ago

144
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:08,668
we only had five so instead of actually

145
00:05:07,168 --> 00:05:10,469
encouraging people to become can

146
00:05:08,668 --> 00:05:12,930
organizations we encourage people to

147
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:14,610
develop their own organization study

148
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:15,870
local drug policy come up with something

149
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:18,389
that will be effective right in their

150
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:19,829
hometown from touring coast to coast I

151
00:05:18,389 --> 00:05:22,680
know you've had a chance to meet a lot

152
00:05:19,829 --> 00:05:26,038
of people what have you seen firsthand

153
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:27,720
what injustice have you seen firsthand

154
00:05:26,038 --> 00:05:29,370
that are stemming from the prohibition

155
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:31,500
laws that you really think need to be

156
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:33,149
immediately changed oh boy I've seen a

157
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,800
lot of injustice as the main thing that

158
00:05:33,149 --> 00:05:38,129
I think is that we need to educate our

159
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:40,710
enforcement police departments basically

160
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:42,329
I could tell you a story about Oakland

161
00:05:40,709 --> 00:05:44,609
California we were out in Oakland at a

162
00:05:42,329 --> 00:05:46,399
Grateful Dead we had her what we do is

163
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:49,439
we set up pimp information tables

164
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:51,478
display books t-shirts and stuff like

165
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:53,370
that we had a permit to set up the table

166
00:05:51,478 --> 00:05:54,930
or in at the Grateful Dead lot like I

167
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:56,459
said please come by they say where's

168
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:58,860
your permit we show them the permit they

169
00:05:56,459 --> 00:06:00,658
say marijuana table permit this can't be

170
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:02,879
possible marijuana is illegal you can't

171
00:06:00,658 --> 00:06:04,379
be here you can't do this they say we

172
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:07,259
have to call the sergeant hold on to the

173
00:06:04,379 --> 00:06:09,389
permit so police officer has a permit

174
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:11,009
with their motorcycle cops the guy gets

175
00:06:09,389 --> 00:06:13,560
on his motorcycle with the permit and he

176
00:06:11,009 --> 00:06:14,939
leaves just leaves the other cops say

177
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,439
well it doesn't matter anyway because if

178
00:06:14,939 --> 00:06:17,490
we would if you know even if you have

179
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:19,139
your permit we're going to park our

180
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:20,900
motorcycles right in front of your table

181
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:23,310
nobody's going to come up to your table

182
00:06:20,899 --> 00:06:25,949
the sergeant comes he says where's your

183
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:27,449
permit we say permit the cop just drove

184
00:06:25,949 --> 00:06:28,829
away with our permit he said you don't

185
00:06:27,449 --> 00:06:30,259
have a permit you can't be here will

186
00:06:28,829 --> 00:06:32,490
arrest you if you don't leave right now

187
00:06:30,259 --> 00:06:33,990
so right there we have it it's the

188
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:35,699
discrimination against the marijuana

189
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:37,860
it's discrimination against the culture

190
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:39,569
and it's just a blatant violations in

191
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:42,028
that they don't really understand the

192
00:06:39,569 --> 00:06:44,189
Constitution that's what we're trying to

193
00:06:42,028 --> 00:06:45,538
do now you say you set up booths at the

194
00:06:44,189 --> 00:06:47,370
Grateful Dead concert so any information

195
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:50,009
do you give to get out of these boots

196
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:52,889
well our main focus is what we call our

197
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:54,509
hemp museum we have different displays

198
00:06:52,889 --> 00:06:56,340
of hemp products that come from around

199
00:06:54,509 --> 00:06:59,699
the world right now you can import

200
00:06:56,339 --> 00:07:01,939
products we display the seeds in the

201
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:04,199
seed cake the granola bars the cloth

202
00:07:01,939 --> 00:07:06,538
different things like that we pass that

203
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:09,449
information we solve products that

204
00:07:06,538 --> 00:07:10,860
display our message basically we feel if

205
00:07:09,449 --> 00:07:13,020
somebody wears a t-shirt around with the

206
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:14,400
marijuana slogan tens of thousands of

207
00:07:13,019 --> 00:07:15,560
people will see that message over there

208
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:18,239
of course the next couple years

209
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:21,778
excellent you know if you had the

210
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:23,098
opportunity to encourage somebody to to

211
00:07:21,778 --> 00:07:24,598
join you would you encourage them to go

212
00:07:23,098 --> 00:07:26,879
on the road working to their in their

213
00:07:24,598 --> 00:07:27,930
own local areas or and how was you I

214
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:29,968
would you go about recruiting that

215
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:31,949
individual i would encourage each person

216
00:07:29,968 --> 00:07:34,829
to choose their focus individually can

217
00:07:31,949 --> 00:07:36,360
decide what your best designed to do

218
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:39,870
within this movement there are a million

219
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:41,490
facets that we need to inter cover

220
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:43,110
basically what do you tell ladies when

221
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:44,819
they come up and say i want to get

222
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:47,759
involved but i'm afraid if I do that

223
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:50,699
I'll lose my children well that's a

224
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:52,110
tough question um I tell people first of

225
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:54,449
all what they need to do is they need to

226
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:56,479
educate themselves when it comes to a

227
00:07:54,449 --> 00:07:58,379
situation something like losing a child

228
00:07:56,478 --> 00:08:00,718
number one you're going to be faced with

229
00:07:58,379 --> 00:08:02,939
the authorities when you're faced with

230
00:08:00,718 --> 00:08:05,519
the authorities that's basically what we

231
00:08:02,939 --> 00:08:07,319
say is it's a it's an on-the-spot type

232
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:09,539
thing educate yourself so if you're

233
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:11,699
faced with a problem you can argue your

234
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:12,870
point there's no reason why you should

235
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:14,310
have to worry about your children being

236
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:16,889
taken away there is nothing wrong with

237
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:19,230
supporting First Amendment are you

238
00:08:16,889 --> 00:08:21,269
primarily an informational organization

239
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:22,800
or can someone call they need help in a

240
00:08:21,269 --> 00:08:25,740
particular area and find that type of

241
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,569
help well like I said we're in network

242
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:29,490
and we can act as a referral to

243
00:08:27,569 --> 00:08:30,870
different organizations whereas we might

244
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:32,399
not have that many resources or

245
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:34,590
information much information at our

246
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,029
Kentucky base we can refer you to all

247
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:37,680
kinds of people all over the country so

248
00:08:36,029 --> 00:08:39,720
you can help people take care of

249
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:41,728
problems hopefully in their own areas if

250
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:43,349
you had the opportunity to say one thing

251
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:44,790
to the people sitting at home listening

252
00:08:43,349 --> 00:08:46,170
that might encourage them to get off

253
00:08:44,789 --> 00:08:49,409
their fanny and do something productive

254
00:08:46,169 --> 00:08:52,169
what would that be oh I would have to

255
00:08:49,409 --> 00:08:54,179
say that it's working and that's what

256
00:08:52,169 --> 00:08:56,669
people have to understand the problem

257
00:08:54,179 --> 00:08:58,349
that we have right now is that the

258
00:08:56,669 --> 00:09:01,679
situation has reached a critical point

259
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:03,720
our laws are bad the laws are so bad

260
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:05,279
that people don't even realize anymore

261
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,629
that there is a problem as far as the

262
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,339
Constitution they don't realize they

263
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:09,750
have the right to speak up for their

264
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:11,040
rights they don't realize there's the

265
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:13,320
right to protest they don't realize that

266
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:16,169
they can pass out information about

267
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:20,100
marijuana it's illegal so what I would

268
00:09:16,169 --> 00:09:21,299
tell people is you know basically the

269
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,320
only way that we're going to change this

270
00:09:21,299 --> 00:09:23,789
the only way that we're going to change

271
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,379
this debate is to get out there to

272
00:09:23,789 --> 00:09:27,209
exercise our First Amendment rights and

273
00:09:25,379 --> 00:09:29,939
to talk to people about it once you

274
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:32,129
start talking to people you become

275
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:34,050
empowered people understand the that

276
00:09:32,129 --> 00:09:36,480
it's the truth and literally your

277

284
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,509
the world that we still need yet to

285
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:54,540
change we can't do it without a group of

286
00:09:51,509 --> 00:09:57,720
people joining each other to make that

287
00:09:54,539 --> 00:09:59,490
difference please take the time take the
