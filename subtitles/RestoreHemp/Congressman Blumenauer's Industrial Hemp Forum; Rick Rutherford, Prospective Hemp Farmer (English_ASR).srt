1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:04,980
the more information we get out about

2
00:00:02,339 --> 00:00:06,419
hemp and what fabulous plant it is and

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:08,339
what it could do for the economy of

4
00:00:06,419 --> 00:00:11,280
Oregon one and for the economy of the

5
00:00:08,339 --> 00:00:12,300
United States is uh just tantamount it's

6
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:15,298
very important

7
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:18,719
um I am not necessarily an expert by any

8
00:00:15,298 --> 00:00:21,420
means but I have educated myself on him

9
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:23,820
um because as a wheat farmer what we

10
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:26,580
traditionally do is we grow one field

11
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:28,439
one year with wheat when it's harvested

12
00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:31,559
you leave the stubble on the ground and

13
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:34,079
then that field stays fallow for an

14
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:36,058
entire year so that the plant breaks

15
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,460
down and it puts nutrients in the soil

16
00:00:36,058 --> 00:00:40,320
and you also get some moisture from the

17
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:43,558
rain and so forth that gets stored in

18
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:46,579
the ground and that's what the wheat

19
00:00:43,558 --> 00:00:49,140
seeds used to grow up again

20
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:50,939
we found out that hemp is a fabulous

21
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:52,679
rotational cash crop that you can be

22
00:00:50,939 --> 00:00:53,820
growing in this field one year and you

23
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:56,759
have wheat in the other and then you

24
00:00:53,820 --> 00:01:00,238
swap them back and forth it works very

25
00:00:56,759 --> 00:01:03,000
well as a natural herbicide because it

26
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:05,640
grows a lot faster than the weeds do and

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,459
it crowds them out essentially so you

28
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,618
wouldn't have to use quite as much or

29
00:01:08,459 --> 00:01:11,938
as you would with the traditional wheat

30
00:01:10,618 --> 00:01:14,459
that we do right now and I would rather

31
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:16,079
not have to do it but there's a lot of

32
00:01:14,459 --> 00:01:18,959
weeds and stuff that are very aggressive

33
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:22,519
they're still unlike morning glory and

34
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:22,519
things that this will take over field

35
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,780
um we had our first hemp harvest in the

36
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,420
United States in over 50 years in

37
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:33,859
Colorado that was awesome and I hope to

38
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:33,859
be able to do that myself

39
00:01:34,739 --> 00:01:40,259
um and I have to ask the question of

40
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:43,520
well why can't I myself grow him uh and

41
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:46,379
that question is that some years ago

42
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:49,259
some very moneyed interests the Hearst

43
00:01:46,379 --> 00:01:51,539
Family the duponts The Rockefellers got

44
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:52,978
together and they came up with a thing

45
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:55,759
called the marijuana

46
00:01:52,978 --> 00:01:59,759
um what's the marijuana tax act

47
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:02,280
at the time people referred to hemp as

48
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:04,200
hemp and so when this legislation was

49
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,718
going through they changed the name to

50
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,618
marijuana so that the hemp farmers were

51
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:09,118
like well I don't know what this

52
00:02:07,618 --> 00:02:10,679
marijuana thing is and so they didn't

53
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:13,199
get involved in it until the last minute

54
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:15,539
well it was a little bit too late and

55
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:18,199
they were uh pushed out to the point

56
00:02:15,539 --> 00:02:20,719
where they couldn't do it anymore until

57
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:23,699
they started the hymn for victory

58
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:25,680
process during World War II because we

59
00:02:23,699 --> 00:02:27,659
needed to have ropes and canvas and a

60
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,819
lot of ants to use in the ships and to

61
00:02:27,659 --> 00:02:32,340
fight uh you know against the Axis

62
00:02:29,818 --> 00:02:34,919
powers and one of the reasons why that

63
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:37,378
is is because hemp is one of the

64
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:39,719
strongest plant fibers known to man and

65
00:02:37,378 --> 00:02:41,340
it's very resistance to seawater so

66
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:42,539
seafaring peoples of the world have been

67
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,159
using it and their ropes and their

68
00:02:42,539 --> 00:02:45,780
canvas and their sails for years and

69
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:47,000
years and years because it lasts a long

70
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:51,780
long time

71
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,280
as a matter of fact they found uh ships

72
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:54,840
at the bottom of Mediterranean Ocean

73
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,900
that have been down there for 2 000

74
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,819
years or more and they have hemp fibers

75
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:02,580
on there and when they bring them up

76
00:02:59,818 --> 00:03:05,759
they still can identify them as hemp

77
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:08,160
fibers because of its fabulous resistant

78
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:09,780
to seawater and so I think that it would

79
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:12,120
be an amazing thing for us to be able to

80
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:14,098
actually Farm in here

81
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,658
um you know that and going back to those

82
00:03:14,098 --> 00:03:17,039
moneyed interests they also came up with

83
00:03:15,658 --> 00:03:20,579
something called the Reefer Madness

84
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:23,280
campaign in order to get people on board

85
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:25,500
with uh making him go away they had to

86
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,759
make people think that if people smoked

87
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,979
it they were going to go crazy and jump

88
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:30,539
off buildings and rape people and do all

89
00:03:28,979 --> 00:03:32,280
kinds of stuff and they did a really

90
00:03:30,539 --> 00:03:33,840
good campaign of smearing and Randolph

91
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:36,900
first it was fabulous at doing that

92
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,759
propaganda and he promulgated that idea

93
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:40,799
and that idea still stands today as a

94
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:42,318
matter of fact one of Congressman blumen

95
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,400
hours

96
00:03:42,318 --> 00:03:47,699
cohorts that he works with is Michelle

97
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,980
Bachmann and she has an ad on her on her

98
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:52,560
webpage that is called the faces of pop

99
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:54,719
and what they did is they took the Faces

100
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,400
of Meth lady and said she was a beauty

101
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:58,139
queen and then two weeks later look at

102
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,599
her after smoking pot and she just has

103
00:03:58,139 --> 00:04:01,979
this melted face and so it's just silly

104
00:04:00,598 --> 00:04:04,079
that a lot of people still believe in

105
00:04:01,979 --> 00:04:07,979
that um

106
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:10,500
stupid idea of what hemp or marijuana

107
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:11,699
would do to somebody if they smoke as a

108
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:14,340
matter of fact my father used to make

109
00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:15,780
jokes about smoking rope and his buddies

110
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:17,699
would laugh and I would be like let's

111
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:20,220
smoking her up I don't understand this

112
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:22,560
and um I later found out it was because

113
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:24,600
ropes are made from him and hemp was

114
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,959
associated with the things that are

115
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:30,000
intoxicated and which it is not at all

116
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:32,279
um so the other thing I know about pimp

117
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,800
is that it is one of the most easily

118
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:37,500
digestible plant proteins known to man

119
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,960
and there are no known allergens to it

120
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:42,839
so you can eat it you can

121
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:44,459
put it on your body you can do all kinds

122
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:47,459
of things with it and it's really

123
00:04:44,459 --> 00:04:48,659
fabulous and I think that again we

124
00:04:47,459 --> 00:04:50,159
should be able to farm it in the United

125
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:51,720
States or want to be a little farmer as

126
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,919
soon as possible we're of course going

127
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,180
to have to do studies because we don't

128
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:56,219
know what strains are going to grow in

129
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:58,860
arid areas like Eastern Oregon Beaufort

130
00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:00,660
doesn't get a lot of rain so the

131
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:02,280
moisture that comes out of the sky in

132
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:05,240
the in the springtime in the wintertime

133
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:07,559
that's essentially what you get to

134
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:09,180
irrigate your crops with we're also in

135
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:11,339
an area where you don't do a lot of

136
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:14,100
irrigation from the ground unless you're

137
00:05:11,339 --> 00:05:15,779
growing something like Alfalfa but you

138
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:17,639
can't grow Alfalfa in some of the higher

139
00:05:15,779 --> 00:05:19,138
areas it's using the lower stuff and we

140
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:20,040
have some of the best Alfalfa in the

141
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:23,040
world

142
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:23,040
so

143
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:26,899
um

144
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,478
again it comes down to educating

145
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:32,460
yourselves and that's one of the things

146
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:34,500
that I did was educate myself on it as

147
00:05:32,459 --> 00:05:36,000
much as I could with the limited things

148
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,978
and limited information more information

149
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,740
is coming online nowadays which is

150
00:05:37,978 --> 00:05:42,360
fabulous but um recently a gentleman did

151
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:45,660
a really simple film called bringing it

152
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:47,879
home it's a uh it's a a great little

153
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:49,199
documentary it's really short it's funny

154
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:51,659
and it's got some great information

155
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:54,120
about the differences between the

156
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:56,039
Cannabis Indica Canada sativa why

157
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:58,680
they're cousins and why

158
00:05:56,038 --> 00:06:01,019
um uh we should be able to be able to

159
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,819
tell the difference between the two so

160
00:06:01,019 --> 00:06:04,198
if you guys could get a chance to look

161
00:06:02,819 --> 00:06:06,659
at that I don't know where it's on

162
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:09,660
Netflix or whatever but you

163
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:12,320
find it someplace but it's called

164
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:14,880
bringing it bringing it home

165
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:18,439
yeah YouTube there you go it's actually

166
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:22,199
being played out there on my laptop

167
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:24,120
so I urge everybody to watch that so uh

168
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:28,500
yeah that's all I've got there

169
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:31,139
um uh well I I do want to say one thing

170
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:32,939
if Monsanto gets a protection act

171
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:35,280
why don't we have an organ farmer

172
00:06:32,939 --> 00:06:37,459
pretend to protection protect us right

173
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:37,459
now
