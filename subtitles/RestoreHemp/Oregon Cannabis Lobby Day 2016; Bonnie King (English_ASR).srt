1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,309
hi everybody friends it's really great

2
00:00:03,089 --> 00:00:09,089
to be here I'm Bonnie king with salem

3
00:00:05,309 --> 00:00:10,349
news com I know I'm kind of preaching to

4
00:00:09,089 --> 00:00:12,570
the choir but I just wanted to say a

5
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:14,490
couple of things I was born and raised

6
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:16,740
here in Oregon like so many of you

7
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:18,810
people were too I was the daughter of

8
00:00:16,739 --> 00:00:20,639
commercial beekeepers some real salt of

9
00:00:18,809 --> 00:00:22,528
the earth kind of folks and they

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,480
believed in American they believed in

11
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:27,899
the state of Oregon these are people

12
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:31,439
that really wanted us to live the life

13
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:36,000
of liberty and happiness all of us sick

14
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:38,340
old poor rich no matter and so when I

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,170
became a journalist being able to inform

16
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:42,059
people and tell them things that they

17
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:44,370
would not have already known to make

18
00:00:42,058 --> 00:00:45,659
them informed decision makers to give

19
00:00:44,369 --> 00:00:47,759
them the knowledge that they needed to

20
00:00:45,659 --> 00:00:49,529
do to be able to move forward in their

21
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:52,229
own lives is terribly important to me

22
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:54,090
and then one of the friends that you all

23
00:00:52,229 --> 00:00:56,640
have known for so many years dr. Phil

24
00:00:54,090 --> 00:01:02,730
leveque he was a real warrior for truth

25
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:05,700
wasn't he dr. leveque I fought for the

26
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:08,069
OMP in the 90s along with Paul Stanford

27
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:10,829
Paul Looney so many of you others and

28
00:01:08,069 --> 00:01:14,879
you know he never he was a do-or-die

29
00:01:10,829 --> 00:01:16,709
kind of guy and I know absolutely if he

30
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:19,079
was standing here right now he would say

31
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:23,280
he is mad as hell that they are doing

32
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:26,908
this to our program so the ommp as it

33
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:30,659
stands is a healthy happy successful

34
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:32,670
program just like Scott said it's an

35
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:34,320
example for others all over the United

36
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:36,420
States which means all over the world

37
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:38,578
this isn't something that needed to be

38
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:42,240
messed with when measured 91 was passed

39
00:01:38,578 --> 00:01:45,469
in good faith by Oregon voters they were

40
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:48,089
obviously boondoggle they were obviously

41
00:01:45,469 --> 00:01:50,009
you know somebody somewhere had a

42
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:52,170
strategy in mind because this isn't what

43
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:54,780
we voted for three times in that bill

44
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:56,820
were protected three times it says that

45
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:58,950
this is not going to affect the Medical

46
00:01:56,819 --> 00:02:03,539
Marijuana Program and here we are after

47
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:07,399
all this time fighting for ommp again

48
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:09,959
it's absolutely unconscionable that the

49
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:12,060
lawmakers of our state would try to

50
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:15,209
overrule the citizens

51
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:17,310
this state when we know what is good for

52
00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:19,979
us take care of the sick and dying

53
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:23,250
people of this state why aren't they the

54
00:02:19,979 --> 00:02:26,159
priority that's what this is for we are

55
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:28,469
not just a roadmap for recreation that

56
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:30,659
is not why this program began that is

57
00:02:28,469 --> 00:02:33,060
not why we bought so hard there's not

58
00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:35,579
why people serve time in prison then

59
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:38,580
have died before this happened we need

60
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:40,140
to protect ommp and you know people that

61
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:41,700
have come before me have said this too

62
00:02:40,139 --> 00:02:43,829
but you know you got to stand for

63
00:02:41,699 --> 00:02:46,379
something or you'll stand for anything

64
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:48,630
so Stanford what's right you guys stand

65
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:52,879
for what we voted for stand for the OMP

66
00:02:48,629 --> 00:02:52,879
and stand for Oregon
