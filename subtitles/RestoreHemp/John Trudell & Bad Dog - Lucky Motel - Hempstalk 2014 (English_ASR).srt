1
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:08,679
so

2
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,440
oh

3
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,040
during times of shadow

4
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,840
in the background

5
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:47,839
a burst

6
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,239
the sun

7
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:54,799
waits for the moon

8
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:54,799
to torch

9
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,320
to torch tonight

10
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:12,798
the lucky motel

11
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,520
at the corner of nowhere

12
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,520
in the past

13
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:21,200
where memories go

14
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,200
to forget

15
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,759
to forget

16
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:31,359
to erase

17
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:35,359
her name is lacy

18
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:35,359
she makes it crazy kind of crazy

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,719
his name is

20
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:42,478
she can hear it

21
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:47,599
she wants one

22
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:51,519
but doesn't want

23
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:51,519
sparks of the stars burning

24
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:54,399
strong heat

25
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:12,000
as a passion of storm

26
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,598
fiery rain

27
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
lightning

28
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:17,000
carries thunder

29
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,840
my

30
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,760
she's a good girl

31
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,400
coming to understand

32
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:17,679
that sometimes this is what good girls

33
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,239
do

34
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,959
what good girls do

35
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:26,239
in the breath of science

36
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:28,400
and the magic of home

37
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,840
they held them together

38
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:34,959
so it's not to feel so

39
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,959
alone so alone

40
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:42,080
during times of shadow

41
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:44,479
in the background verse

42
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:47,120
the sun waits for the moon

43
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:49,199
to torch tonight

44
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:52,319
towards sinner

45
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:55,518
in the breath of sod

46
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:58,000
in the magic of moon

47
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:01,840
they held them together

48
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:05,080
so as not to feel so alone

49
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,080
so alone

50
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,800
you
