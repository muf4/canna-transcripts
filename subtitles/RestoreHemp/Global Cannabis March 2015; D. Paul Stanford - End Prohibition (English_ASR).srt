1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,099
thanks folks hey thanks for coming out

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:08,039
for the March we finally did it we've

3
00:00:05,099 --> 00:00:11,339
got legal marijuana congratulations and

4
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:13,798
thank you for making it happen staying

5
00:00:11,339 --> 00:00:15,899
at the fight for so long you know I've

6
00:00:13,798 --> 00:00:17,759
been saying in a long time that cannabis

7
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:21,600
prohibition has never really been about

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:23,760
drugs it's about control and money and

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,000
power and the continued centralization

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,800
of Economic and political control I

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,679
truly believe that marijuana the whole

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,920
marijuana myth was created to stop the

13
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:38,219
use of biofuels and fiber they made up

14
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,600
that whole myth and so finally the truth

15
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:42,359
is coming to light but we're still

16
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,820
experiencing blowback we still have the

17
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:46,558
legislature trying to shut down the

18
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:49,799
medical marijuana program they've been

19
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:53,578
successful across the river in

20
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:56,099
Washington with uh Senate Bill 5052

21
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:58,259
which Governor Inslee signed into law

22
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,359
just last week

23
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:03,299
they have to stop that I hope they can

24
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:06,539
organize a referendum they need 120 000

25
00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:09,179
signatures in the next 75 days or so

26
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:11,520
good luck to the folks behind that

27
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:13,979
hopefully we won't have to do a

28
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:15,599
referendum here in Oregon we have a few

29
00:01:13,978 --> 00:01:17,340
friends in the legislature but we have

30
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:19,559
to stay active with them as well and

31
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:21,359
contact them and let them know what we

32
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,759
don't like it looks like

33
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:25,799
the community's done a great job last

34
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:28,438
week in reaching out and stopping some

35
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:33,000
of the worst aspects of the dash six

36
00:01:28,438 --> 00:01:35,219
amendments to Senate Bill 844 but it's

37
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,560
still working its way through there and

38
00:01:35,219 --> 00:01:40,140

39
