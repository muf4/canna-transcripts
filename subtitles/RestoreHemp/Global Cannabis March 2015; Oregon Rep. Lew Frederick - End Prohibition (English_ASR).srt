1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,379
greetings from northeast portland and

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:05,640
from the capital and from salem listen

3
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:07,620
i'm not going to talk long i know you

4
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:09,509
all have been here for a long day

5
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:11,730
already i just wanted to update you on

6
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:13,769
what's going on in salem right now now

7
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:16,429
as you probably know it's a passage of

8
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:19,170
91 was just the beginning of a process

9
00:00:16,429 --> 00:00:20,670
laws don't spell out all the procedures

10
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:22,140
required to make them work and some of

11
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:24,449
that's being hammered out by the Oregon

12
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,350
Liquor Control Commission as well as

13
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:28,170
some of that some of it in the

14
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:30,599
legislature in fact yesterday the olcc

15
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:33,000
put together a group of committees that

16
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:35,969
are going to look at rules and licensing

17
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,909
and quality and financing and extracts

18
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:40,230
and infused items and growers are going

19
00:00:38,909 --> 00:00:42,328
to look at all those different issues

20
00:00:40,229 --> 00:00:44,189
but I want to tell you I'm not going to

21
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:46,320
talk about those i want to i know that i

22
00:00:44,189 --> 00:00:48,000
was asked to speak because of a bill I

23
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,308
introduced in the beginning of the and

24
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,289
start the process of cleaning up some of

25
00:00:50,308 --> 00:00:56,459
the effects of the so-called war on

26
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:57,960
drugs unfortunately that bill 3372

27
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:01,170
probably isn't going to make it through

28
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:05,129
the process this time fortunately

29
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:06,990
another bill will okay it won't do

30
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:09,150
everything I had I had hope but as Mick

31
00:01:06,989 --> 00:01:11,250
Jagger would have been talking about the

32
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:13,618
legislative process he he said you can't

33
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:15,719
always get what you want so what are we

34
00:01:13,618 --> 00:01:17,670
trying to do well it's important to

35
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:19,978
recognize the extreme criminalization of

36
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:22,228
certain marijuana related activities has

37
00:01:19,978 --> 00:01:24,989
done more harm to our communities then

38
00:01:22,228 --> 00:01:26,609
the drug itself ever could combined with

39
00:01:24,989 --> 00:01:28,828
measure 11 and put a lot of people

40
00:01:26,609 --> 00:01:31,319
behind the bar behind bars and gave a

41
00:01:28,828 --> 00:01:33,508
lot of people felony records for actions

42
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:37,019
that will not be criminal in the future

43
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:39,959
a stint in prison is not the end of one

44
00:01:37,019 --> 00:01:41,699
so-called debt to society a felony

45
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:44,188
record can follow you for the rest of

46
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:46,680
your life closing doors to housing and

47
00:01:44,188 --> 00:01:49,019
employment disrupting families and

48
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,159
dragging the whole community down we

49
00:01:49,019 --> 00:01:52,078
should have learned that from the

50
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:55,320
experience of alcohol prohibition in the

51
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:57,809
1920s and 30s but we had to run the

52
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:59,789
experiment again it seems and now as we

53
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:02,189
come to our senses and creative system

54
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:03,719
in which cannabis is legal but regulated

55
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:04,978
in the future we also need to do

56
00:02:03,718 --> 00:02:06,929
something about the harm that's been

57
00:02:04,978 --> 00:02:09,030
done by the prohibition in the past and

58
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:12,750
that's why I introduced a bill I

59
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:13,770
introduced a bill to create a path to

60
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,810
the expungement of

61
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:20,909
records of nonviolent marijuana related

62
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:22,620
records and and the reduction of

63
00:02:20,909 --> 00:02:24,689
sentences for similar offenses for

64
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:27,210
people who are still in custody or under

65
00:02:24,689 --> 00:02:29,219
supervision it's this is a high priority

66
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:31,230
priority for me to do something about

67
00:02:29,219 --> 00:02:33,270
this because while I won't deny that

68
00:02:31,229 --> 00:02:35,639
crime affects our community and I won't

69
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:37,409
deny that incarceration sometimes it's

70
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:39,479
an appropriate response to criminal acts

71
00:02:37,409 --> 00:02:42,049
I also believe that has been used too

72
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:44,699
often where it makes no sense at all

73
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:47,219
creating criminals out out of people who

74
00:02:44,699 --> 00:02:48,780
are doing no harm we need to fix that

75
00:02:47,219 --> 00:02:51,090
for the future and also reach back and

76
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:53,849
fix what has happened in the past now as

77
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:55,800
I said 33 to 72 is not going to make it

78
00:02:53,849 --> 00:02:57,599
but details matter a lot in the

79
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,400
legislative process and we just couldn't

80
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:01,500
work out through the details in the time

81
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,030
that we had I understand however that

82
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:05,099
there will be another bill coming

83
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:06,930
through the committee on implementing

84
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:09,569
the Senate the Senate and House

85
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:11,849
Committee on implementing measure 91 in

86
00:03:09,569 --> 00:03:13,259
the how in the district and the capital

87
00:03:11,849 --> 00:03:16,259
that's called the Joint Committee on

88
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:18,319
marijuana just so that you know yes it's

89
00:03:16,259 --> 00:03:20,699
a joke and everyone seems to like it I

90
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:24,930
am always set for some of the folks here

91
00:03:20,699 --> 00:03:27,449
I urge you to use the online Oregon

92
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:30,270
legislative information system olas look

93
00:03:27,449 --> 00:03:32,280
that up Oh L is to keep informed about

94
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:34,170
what the committee is doing and I hope

95
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:37,110
you'll pay more attention to this make

96
00:03:34,169 --> 00:03:40,019
more attention to more than this one

97
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:42,090
issue because make I want you to make

98
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:45,770
this issue your gateway issue for more

99
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:48,330
involvement in our policy making process

100
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:50,760
our system works better when people

101
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:52,830
watch and take part and that means you

102
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:55,590
and I want to also just thank you for

103
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:58,350
coming out and and being so active in

104
00:03:55,590 --> 00:04:00,719
the campaign last year and stay active

105
00:03:58,349 --> 00:04:03,120
we need to have you to continue to

106
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:05,219
listen to what's going on to watch to

107
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,810
talk with everyone know who your

108
00:04:05,219 --> 00:04:08,280
legislators are do you know who your

109
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:10,289
legislators are how many of you know who

110
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,120
your legislators are all right if you

111
00:04:10,289 --> 00:04:13,949
don't you need to look it up and find

112
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,870
out who that is and go and talk with

113
00:04:13,949 --> 00:04:17,399
them let them know that you're out there

114
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:18,810
let them know that you're watching and

115
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:20,668
that you want to have some things

116
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:22,108
changed as I said I don't think my

117
00:04:20,668 --> 00:04:24,149
particular bill is going to make it

118
00:04:22,108 --> 00:04:26,529
through but I believe we will get a bill

119
00:04:24,149 --> 00:04:28,089
that will come through in some form

120
00:04:26,529 --> 00:04:30,009
work that will make certainly make

121
00:04:28,089 --> 00:04:32,319
things a little better for the folks who

122
00:04:30,009 --> 00:04:34,149
have been incarcerated who have records

123
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:36,579
anto who are presently incarcerated

124
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:38,649
maybe we'll get some changes and that'll

125
00:04:36,579 --> 00:04:40,418
only because become because you decide

126
00:04:38,649 --> 00:04:42,989
to work for it so thank you very much

127
00:04:40,418 --> 00:04:42,990
take care
