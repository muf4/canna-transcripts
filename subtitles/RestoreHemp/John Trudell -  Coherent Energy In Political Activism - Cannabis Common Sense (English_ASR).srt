1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,270
this comes in a matter i think the

2
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:05,309
finding new ways to approach this thing

3
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:06,929
exactly mere you know these are the

4
00:00:05,309 --> 00:00:08,039
mother talking about the stuff they do

5
00:00:06,929 --> 00:00:12,629
but these are the people that created

6
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:14,070
the Inquisition yeah I'm anything that

7
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:16,859
they were doing doing we're not being

8
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:19,230
realistic and pragmatic if someone act

9
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:20,880
of cruelty or stupidity or just plain

10
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:22,679
old cold-bloodedness happens and we're

11
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:27,960
shocked and surprised by it then shame

12
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:29,250
on us exactly yeah yeah so so it's

13
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,710
really to me a matter because

14
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:34,019
everything's about energy all right and

15
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:35,489
they're focusing their energy we can

16
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,140
call it whether it's the hate stuff all

17
00:00:35,488 --> 00:00:39,659
the discussion but they're focusing

18
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:42,000
their energy in such a way all right

19
00:00:39,659 --> 00:00:44,339
that it's being effective for them and

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,350
and and but it's it also because they

21
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:48,059
can hit us and push emotional buttons

22
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:51,270
and pull the stores out of us then they

23
00:00:48,058 --> 00:00:53,039
distort our energy you know and so to me

24
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:54,570
I think what's really ahead of us is

25
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,429
it's not even a matter of our organizing

26
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:59,009
them it's a matter of out thinking them

27
00:00:56,429 --> 00:01:01,500
thinking differently outside of their

28
00:00:59,009 --> 00:01:02,729
definitions and inside of the bar yeah

29
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,188
outside the box because see we're

30
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:06,840
talking about alternative energies

31
00:01:04,188 --> 00:01:09,029
because the whole marijuana thing all of

32
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:11,939
it but really this everything is about

33
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:13,799
energy and when I look at it is well we

34
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:15,329
are individual alternative energy

35
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:18,360
sources if we looked at ourselves as

36
00:01:15,329 --> 00:01:21,509
alternative energy as well as we do hemp

37
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:23,400
or whatever else you know and understood

38
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:26,069
the value of that and then use that

39
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,540
power of our creative intelligence use

40
00:01:26,069 --> 00:01:29,459
that power of our creative intelligence

41
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:31,500
clearly and currently we can out think

42
00:01:29,459 --> 00:01:33,868
these people but it's not happening

43
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:36,328
because because we've been imprinted and

44
00:01:33,868 --> 00:01:38,219
wired to have these insecurities these

45
00:01:36,328 --> 00:01:39,629
doubts and these reactionary fear so

46
00:01:38,219 --> 00:01:41,670
they they know they can push in your

47
00:01:39,629 --> 00:01:43,618
motion button so they're spending so

48
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:44,939
however many of these things are half of

49
00:01:43,618 --> 00:01:47,250
that just put out there just to push our

50
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:50,459
emotional buttons it's not to recruit a

51
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:51,780
new people have been rebelling against

52
00:01:50,459 --> 00:01:53,429
the oppressor class since there's been

53
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,978
an oppressor class and I look within our

54
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:58,140
my own lifetime we were young idealistic

55
00:01:55,978 --> 00:02:00,179
our stuff we want it all to be good in

56
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:01,618
fairness and that you know and so we did

57
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:03,630
all the stuff we went out there we took

58
00:02:01,618 --> 00:02:05,819
all that out there basically that the

59
00:02:03,629 --> 00:02:07,949
generations had done before and the way

60
00:02:05,819 --> 00:02:09,989
that they did it now and so what's

61
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:12,539
missing if our intentions are good our

62
00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:13,439
motives are good our idealism is good

63
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:15,269
and yet the

64
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:17,310
stay on top of us in what's missing and

65
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:18,810
I think what's missing is we weren't

66
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:21,750
using the palm of our creative

67
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:23,610
intelligence clearly and coherently see

68
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:25,110
we were just picking up all behavior

69
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:27,090
patterns and organizing the same way

70
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:28,710
under the same definitions at the

71
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:30,900
generation before had in generation

72
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:32,580
before heads we never challenged we

73
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,170
never we never approached it from the

74
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:35,969
concert the perspective of well maybe

75
00:02:34,169 --> 00:02:38,069
life is about responsibility and not

76
00:02:35,969 --> 00:02:39,810
freedom because I've responsibility has

77
00:02:38,069 --> 00:02:42,150
it's got a definite meaning to us

78
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:43,770
whereas freedom is an abstraction all

79
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:45,480
right i mean it is because i can say i

80
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:48,900
believe in freedom but then that means

81
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:51,209
that that the racist liar that lies

82
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,830
about hemp the only thing then what they

83
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:55,020
have the freedom to do that if i had you

84
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:56,490
know since it's an action right and

85
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:57,689
we've never really approached this thing

86
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:59,879
whole thing from the sense the

87
00:02:57,689 --> 00:03:01,740
perception of responsibility what we

88
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:06,379
have a response it because if we want to

89
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:09,420
be free being free is connected to

90
00:03:06,379 --> 00:03:11,159
responsibility alright being oppressed

91
00:03:09,419 --> 00:03:15,000
his concept is connected to this

92
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:18,079
abstract hill logical all right no

93
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,080
definition of freedom
