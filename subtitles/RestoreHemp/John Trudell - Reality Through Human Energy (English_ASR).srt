1
00:00:00,589 --> 00:00:06,330
and whatever's going on in this

2
00:00:02,759 --> 00:00:09,629
dimensional reality will never help

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:15,000
fight them it's about how thinking then

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:25,698
it's about how thinking just think about

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:29,518
that about alternative energy power

6
00:00:25,699 --> 00:00:35,579
power alternative energy conscious live

7
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:38,339
thought process of thinking energy we

8
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:42,420
are the alternative energy that can make

9
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:45,270
the change to happen but we really have

10
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:47,640
to understand what this means we really

11
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:51,329
have to get it and understand it then we

12
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:53,609
become that power power the people but

13
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:55,189
and to do with the vote or any

14
00:00:53,609 --> 00:00:57,948
other thing that's got to do with

15
00:00:55,189 --> 00:01:00,869
thinking with a clear coherent

16
00:00:57,948 --> 00:01:04,338
intelligent mind use the intelligence

17
00:01:00,869 --> 00:01:06,899
early in clear how much power do we have

18
00:01:04,338 --> 00:01:08,519
if you can you make yourself feel

19
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:11,580
miserable with your fears your doubts

20
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:15,449
mere insecurities if you can do that you

21
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:18,599
have power simply put

22
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:21,750
alright so it's just a matter but that's

23
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:23,908
power used in coherently and chaotically

24
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:26,188
so just thinking some mental shifts here

25
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:30,240
and use that power clearly and

26
00:01:26,188 --> 00:01:36,719
coherently and real change this is the

27
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:39,750
power of the beat like this cannabis Tax

28
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:42,390
Act your vote but you you the voting is

29
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:45,090
like using it as a tool you know you

30
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:50,750
just use it as a tool but your power

31
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:50,750
isn't their powers you
