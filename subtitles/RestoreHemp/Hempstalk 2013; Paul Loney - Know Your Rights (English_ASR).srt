1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:05,819
but let us celebrate house bill 3460.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,400
here's allowing more transparency and

3
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:10,759
freedom it is helping us in our markets

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:14,820
right folks don't forget that

5
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:17,579
and so however our marijuana law is full

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,960
of gray areas areas that we all have to

7
00:00:17,579 --> 00:00:21,538
be aware of

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:25,740
remember possessing and growing

9
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:27,900
marijuana must be out of public view out

10
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:31,079
of public view means on a public view

11
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:33,058
it's not on your front porch not in your

12
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:34,920
car with the visor down you're not in

13
00:00:33,058 --> 00:00:37,199
the parking lot of the concert or as

14
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,079
Scott says not here you got to be a

15
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,219
professional about it

16
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:43,558
and we have to remember I had to count

17
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:44,640
folks there are no such thing as extra

18
00:00:43,558 --> 00:00:46,558
plants

19
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,960
there's no such thing as extra plants

20
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:49,979
just in case your plants Hermie or one

21
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,899
dies

22
00:00:49,979 --> 00:00:54,000
you know your plant count is your plant

23
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:56,640
count no matter what

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,920
and we have to know right away

25
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,799
the positive the police weigh everything

26
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:04,939
folks including that bag of leaves you

27
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:04,939
intended to compost

28
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,799
so Aaron please remember your card does

29
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:13,500
not protect you on Federal Land

30
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,840
you can and we'll get a citation that

31
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,799
will cost you money and potentially your

32
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,600
freedom

33
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,500
and your student aid if you're in

34
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:21,839
college

35
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,978
just for simply possessing a single

36
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,259
joint

37
00:01:22,978 --> 00:01:27,539

38
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:29,519

39
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:31,020

41
00:01:31,019 --> 00:01:36,060

have these four sayings that I'd like

59
00:02:11,098 --> 00:02:14,759
people to repeat after me when I say

60
00:02:12,659 --> 00:02:17,280
them okay so this is what you need to do

61
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:19,318
when you have a police encounter in your

62
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,959
car when you're walking at your home

63
00:02:19,318 --> 00:02:24,479
it's all Sam and please repeat after me

64
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:27,120
because we all have to practice these

65
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:28,859
so when we're brushing our teeth we're

66
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,739
walking down the street in our car

67
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:32,940
instead of sinking to the radio

68
00:02:30,739 --> 00:02:36,680
practicing Saints

69
00:02:32,939 --> 00:02:36,680

73
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,360
