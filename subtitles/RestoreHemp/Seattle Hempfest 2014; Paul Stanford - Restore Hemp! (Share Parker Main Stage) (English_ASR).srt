1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,819
you know I think that marijuana is our

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:09,839
mother earth

3
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:13,320
greatest gift to mankind produces more

4
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:15,240
fuel more fiber and more food than any

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:18,118
other plant on the planet

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:21,118
and marijuana prohibition has never

7
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:24,240
really been about drugs marijuana

8
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:26,160
prohibition was always about money power

9
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:28,379
and the continued centralization of

10
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,259
Economic and political control

11
00:00:28,379 --> 00:00:35,579
the whole marijuana myth was made up to

12
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:39,179
displace petroleum at five and uh tree

13
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:41,340
fiber and [ __ ] fiber they couldn't have

14
00:00:39,179 --> 00:00:45,479
made hip illegal if they said it was him

15
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:47,700
they couldn't have made uh any of that

16
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:49,619
illegal unless if they said it was

17
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:52,399
Cannabis they could have made it illegal

18
00:00:49,619 --> 00:00:55,619
it was only by taking this new word

19
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:57,000
marijuana and using that with raises

20
00:00:55,619 --> 00:01:00,179
propaganda that they were able to

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,698
prohibit it so here we have prohibited

22
00:01:00,179 --> 00:01:05,819
the most productive play it on the

23
00:01:02,698 --> 00:01:08,158
planet the one that is also the oldest

24
00:01:05,819 --> 00:01:11,399
cultivated crop all archaeologists

25
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:14,640
Scream It's been cultivated for at least

26
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:17,219
ten thousand and maybe over 30 000 years

27
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,599
it's the very basis of Agriculture

28
00:01:17,219 --> 00:01:20,219
itself

29
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:22,500
so

30
00:01:20,219 --> 00:01:25,379
we've got the most productive crop and

31
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:27,719
the oldest crop and now we have a

32
00:01:25,379 --> 00:01:30,239
limited legalization with the initiative

33
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:33,179
here where you can have house but that's

34
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:35,039
not enough you folks have to realize we

35
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:38,280
all are going to have to remain active

36
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:42,000
remain Vigilant and contact our

37
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:44,219
political Representatives side petitions

38
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,739
we need to change the law even though

39
00:01:44,219 --> 00:01:49,920
it's a better law it's not good enough

40
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:54,000
until our Farmers could cultivate Health

41
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:56,280
without regard to its THC content but

42
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,659
with a focus on the most productive

43
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:03,000
varieties of seed for fiber and all the

44
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:05,579
various uses of animal until that

45
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,659
happens it's going to be prohibitively

46
00:02:05,578 --> 00:02:09,419
expensive

47
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:11,819
so when we allow Farmers to cultivate

48
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:15,299
hip without regard to its THC content

49
00:02:11,818 --> 00:02:17,579
we'll begin to displace petroleum our

50
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:20,640
Farmers could get that money instead of

51
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:23,099
the electrochemical pharmaceutical

52
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:25,559
military industrial transdational

53
00:02:23,098 --> 00:02:28,259
corporate Elite fascist sons of a

54
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,659
[ __ ] that run the world today and

55
00:02:28,259 --> 00:02:32,878
give us the words for oil

56
00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:35,459
we don't need the petroleum you know

57
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:36,598
everything petroleum touches it makes

58
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:40,199
toxic

59
00:02:36,598 --> 00:02:42,060
if it's a natural alternative and we

60
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:44,280
could give the money to our Farmers it's

61
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:48,239
not going to give to the Swiss bank

62
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:49,378
accounts and the uh despots around the

63
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,719
world

64
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:54,179
we need to restore him so I just urge

65
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:57,120
you guys to get involved don't settle

66
00:02:54,180 --> 00:03:00,260
for the status quo and help us restore

67
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,259
hip thank you
