1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,519
hey it's morgan fox i'm the

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:05,200
communications manager at the marijuana

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,400
policy project um

4
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,720
i really just kind of want to talk about

5
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,320
the television for a little bit um

6
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,400
national

7
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,400
tv is probably one of the most important

8
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,759
uh media

9
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,000
outlets that we can go after just

10
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,920
because it gets the most number of views

11
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,519
uh clips from national tv are the ones

12
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,960
that get posted on blogs and get spread

13
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:24,800
around a lot more that's what really

14
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,320
grabs people's attention and we've

15
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,640
definitely come a long way in getting

16
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,439
access to national media i mean um

17
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:34,079
in 2002 uh one of my predecessors uh

18
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:36,238
tried to call cnn to pitch a story and

19
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,000
uh the receptionist had to put him on

20
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:40,078
hold because she couldn't stop laughing

21
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,840
and when she brought him back uh her

22
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,799
response was all right mr marijuana what

23
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,640
should i

24
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:45,839
say uh you want to talk about

25
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,320
and uh

26
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,160
in 2008 they were calling us i mean

27
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,480
we've really come a long way but now

28
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:54,078
that we have access to it uh it's

29
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:56,238
becoming a

30
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,239
very much a double-edged sword

31
00:00:56,238 --> 00:01:00,399
it's become harder to control the uh the

32
00:00:58,238 --> 00:01:01,679
messaging and uh

33
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,079
harder to get stories pitched the way

34
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:05,760
that we really want them to uh because i

35
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:07,280
mean quite frankly the media cares about

36
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,200
drama they don't care about facts they

37
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,879
don't care about truth all they care

38
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:14,240
about is what's going to get the most

39
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:16,798
views and for that they want drama and

40
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:19,118
conflict so

41
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,280
the trick is to try to get these guys to

42
00:01:19,118 --> 00:01:24,478
focus on the conflicts that we want them

43
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:27,200
to as opposed to the conflicts that

44
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:28,959
they find the easiest and the way that

45
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,320
we do that is i mean first developing

46
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:31,679
relationships with producers to make

47
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:34,000
sure that we can pitch them the type of

48
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,759
stories that we need to but also by

49
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,239
creating our own conflicts so that we

50
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,239
can control the messaging that means uh

51
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:42,319
calling out legislators in public forums

52
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:44,239
so that uh people will start to uh you

53
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:45,599
know ask questions and uh you know maybe

54
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:47,280
put them on the spot a little bit they

55
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:48,719
love it when politicians are embarrassed

56
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,879
and start scammering

57
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:51,840
we all do yeah

58
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:53,519
um

59
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,880
instead of them

60
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:56,560
just waiting for them to find their own

61
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:58,478
stories and going after things like

62
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,840
conflicts within uh ballot initiative

63
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:01,039
campaigns or conflicts within the

64
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,399
movement or

65
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,159
you know that

66
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:07,280
that one dispensary owner who's got a

67
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:08,719
bunch of ak-47s in the back you know

68
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,318
we need to get them to focus on the

69
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:11,598
conflicts that we want them to because

70
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:13,839
those are the juicy stories they don't

71
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:15,359
really care about uh you know how this

72
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,400
bill is going along unless there's some

73
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,319
sort of hook

74
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,159
and uh as we like move forward and try

75
00:02:18,318 --> 00:02:22,560
to get uh more and more media coverage

76
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:23,759
for this uh really i mean we can't find

77
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,159
anybody that's going to debate us on

78
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:27,759
this issue anymore and i've tried uh

79
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:29,039
so many times i'll be talking to uh

80
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:30,560
producers and they say well we want to

81
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:32,799
do a segment on this but we can't find

82
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,360
anybody to uh beat the other side of the

83
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,680
debate i'll do it

84
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,720
masquerade as a drug warrior nice job

85
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:43,360
well what about the children

86
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:44,080
absolutely um but uh those are the

87
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,239
things that we need to really

88
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,319
concentrate on uh creating conflicts

89
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,920
that the media wants uh to look at and

90
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:51,919
that means we have to really try to go

91
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:53,839
out there and embarrass the people that

92
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:56,639
are working against us but of course in

93
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,680
like a polite way um right no cream pies

94
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:59,279
yeah

95
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:03,400
but uh i mean that's really all i've got

96
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,400
uh if anybody has any questions
