beautiful yes give yourselves a

4
00:00:10,919 --> 00:00:17,879
hand you know I remember I remember the

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:21,278
first few hemp fests I remember when we

6
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:25,278
measured our numbers in the hundreds but

7
00:00:21,278 --> 00:00:27,879
it didn't stay that way we grew we grew

8
00:00:25,278 --> 00:00:31,559
to measure Hempfest in the thousands and

9
00:00:27,879 --> 00:00:34,558
the tens of thousands and now Hempfest

10
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:35,399
is measured in the hundreds of thousands

11
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:37,000
of

12
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:39,600
attendees

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,519
yeah and you know the progress of our

14
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:45,120
movement has mirrored the growth of

15
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:49,199
Hempfest since the beginning of Hempfest

16
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:51,558
we've passed medical cannabis laws in 17

17
00:00:49,198 --> 00:00:55,280
States and there's more to come this

18
00:00:51,558 --> 00:00:58,280
year now from the east coast to the West

19
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:01,799
Coast from Michigan to

20
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:04,599
Colorado from New Jersey Jersy to

21
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:08,200
Washington patients can obtain their

22
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:12,280
medicine in safe well-regulated

23
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:14,719
access points they no longer need to

24
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:17,400
negotiate The Perils of the Underground

25
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:20,438
Market they no longer need to worry

26
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:23,600
about getting short weade or getting

27
00:01:20,438 --> 00:01:25,679
contaminated medicine or having a knife

28
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:29,959
or a gun pulled on

29
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:32,200
them we have created tens of thousand

30
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:35,078
thousands of well-paying jobs and access

31
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:37,879
points across the country and those

32
00:01:35,078 --> 00:01:41,399
access points have generated hundreds of

33
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:44,319
millions of dollars of revenue for our

34
00:01:41,399 --> 00:01:47,118
communities we have reduced the burden

35
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:49,398
on law enforcement and we've made our

36
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:53,599
neighborhoods

37
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:55,759
safer we have proven we have proven that

38
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:58,280
cannabis can be distributed in a way

39
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:01,840
that brings benefits to communities

40
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,840
instead of Harms

41
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:07,199
but you know the Guardians of Public

42
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:09,079
Safety up there in the high levels of

43
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,280
the Department of Justice the US

44
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:12,200
attorneys they don't think these are

45
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,959
good

46
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:19,359
things and so last year they launched a

47
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:21,239
coordinated multi- Agency Nationwide

48
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,160
attack on our

49
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:25,719
community now that attack started out in

50
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:28,878
Michigan and

51
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:31,159
Montana and when nobody noticed when

52
00:02:28,878 --> 00:02:34,280
there was no public outcry when there

53
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:37,039
was no blow up in the media the feds

54
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:40,239
expanded this campaign to

55
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:43,878
California where they have closed

56
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:45,759
400 access points with threats of

57
00:02:43,878 --> 00:02:48,518
seizing their

58
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:51,000
property just a few weeks ago Harborside

59
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:52,800
Health Center became the latest Target

60
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,878
of this Federal attack when they served

61
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,959
papers on us to seees the property that

62
00:02:54,878 --> 00:03:02,878
we are located in but we have no

63
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,878
intention of of closing our

64
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:12,679
doors we will never abandon our

65
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:15,920
patients we will use every legal means

66
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:18,519
at our disposal to contest this action

67
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:21,479
on the part of the federal government we

68
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:24,319
have nothing to hide we've done nothing

69
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:27,719
wrong we know that Justice is on our

70
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:31,079
side and we look forward to our day in

71
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:33,199
courtt now since Harbor Side was served

72
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,080
this campaign of the feds unfortunately

73
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:36,518
has

74
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,680
metastized like a malignant cancer it

75
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:42,879
continues to spread 10 threats went out

76
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,920
in Colorado recently and just last week

77
00:03:42,878 --> 00:03:47,120
I'm sorry to say it spread here to your

78
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:49,759
own state of Washington when the US

79
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:53,400
attorney in the eastern district served

80
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:56,438
forfeiture notices on four access points

81
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:58,599
sadly three of them have already

82
00:03:56,438 --> 00:04:00,799
closed are we going to let them get away

83
00:03:58,598 --> 00:04:03,000
with this no

84
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:05,319
no way we're going to let them get away

85
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,479
with it they think they can crush us are

86
00:04:05,318 --> 00:04:10,318
we

87
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:13,078
crushed no way we are roused we are

88
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:15,438
roused to our righteous Fury now we will

89
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:17,120
not be crushed I'll tell you after

90
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:19,759
Harborside was served with these

91
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:22,759
despicable notices offers of assistance

92
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:24,800
poured into us from all over the country

93
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:27,560
every single activist organization you

94
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:30,160
can imagine got in touch with us we had

95
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:32,959
simultaneous demonstrations in four

96
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:35,080
different States including a courageous

97
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:37,519
takeover of the Obama campaign

98
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:40,439

have a common message and we are going

102
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:51,319
to send it clear and Loud we're going to

103
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:54,079
tell President Obama that it is time for

104
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:57,399
him to keep the promise he made to us to

105
00:04:54,079 --> 00:05:00,399
our community it is time for him to call

106
00:04:57,399 --> 00:05:02,799
off these Rogue prosecutors and stop

107
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:08,198
this horrible horrible

108

backwards now all across this country

114
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:28,839
we've built laws we've passed laws and

115
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:30,239
built systems of distribution that have

116
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:32,239
allowed patient

117
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,560
to come out of the Shadows of the

118
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:37,079
Underground Market and come into the

119
