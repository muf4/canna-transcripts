59
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:12,310
ballot title and summary that Paul Loney

60
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:14,409
just read is written by the Attorney

61
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:18,939
General and Secretary of State's office

62
00:03:14,409 --> 00:03:21,039
to meet certain statutory requirements

63
00:03:18,939 --> 00:03:23,439
to describe the actual legislation the

64
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:26,318
legislation itself is much longer and

65
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:28,930
more detailed but that's what they wrote

66
00:03:26,318 --> 00:03:31,119
yeah and it's like I say it's a real

67
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:33,760
good one I mean it is good it you know

68
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,439
we keep the drive in the influence of

69
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:37,810
intoxicants laws because we all believe

70
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:39,818
in lease all of us who are volunteering

71
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:41,259
for the garden cameras TaxACT that and

72
00:03:39,818 --> 00:03:43,179
you shouldn't drive on the influence of

73
00:03:41,259 --> 00:03:45,009
anything and so we want to make sure

74
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:46,659
those laws are in there you know we

75
00:03:45,009 --> 00:03:50,229
don't want anybody to say that all we're

76
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:52,389
promoting irresponsible use we are and

77
00:03:50,229 --> 00:03:54,238
not at all were flaunting response we

78
00:03:52,389 --> 00:03:59,230
are promoting responsible use of

79
00:03:54,239 --> 00:04:01,120
cannabis and then and as Drex the Oregon

80
00:03:59,229 --> 00:04:03,789
Liquor Control Commission to license

81
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,950
marijuana cultivation for qualified

82
00:04:03,789 --> 00:04:09,128
persons and for them to purchase the

83
00:04:05,949 --> 00:04:10,988
entire crop and that's you know the

84
00:04:09,128 --> 00:04:14,018
regulation it's a quite that way it's a

85
00:04:10,989 --> 00:04:17,410
well regulated system that it can't go

86
00:04:14,019 --> 00:04:19,780
awry that you know it limit the black

87
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:21,250
marketer if not totally wipe out the

88
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:24,159
black market and I think it was pretty

89
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:27,279
much eliminate the black market maybe

90
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:29,540
not entirely but I'd say 99.9% of the

91
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:34,250
black market would be gone

92
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:36,290
it would license people to grow the drug

93
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:38,149
for sales to the Oregon Liquor Control

94
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:39,800
Commission the Oregon Liquor Control

95
00:04:38,149 --> 00:04:44,179
Commission would then put it in their

96
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:46,040
state liquor stores and also the liquor

97
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:49,579
stores would put it in local bars and

98
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:52,340
and shops that have a license that bars

99
00:04:49,579 --> 00:04:54,649
the entry of minors so that people under

100
00:04:52,339 --> 00:04:57,109
21 couldn't come in to a place where

101
00:04:54,649 --> 00:05:00,529
marijuana is being smoked any more than

102
00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:02,270
they can go into a bar where that's

103
00:05:00,529 --> 00:05:04,489
serving hard liquor drinks or things

104
00:05:02,269 --> 00:05:08,479
like that it would be very similar to

105
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:11,900
that and it would tax the recreational

106
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:13,460
sales of marijuana through these liquor

107
00:05:11,899 --> 00:05:18,229
stores and bars but it would allow

108
00:05:13,459 --> 00:05:20,989
untaxed medical marijuana prescriptions

109
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:22,819
to people through pharmacies so that

110
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:25,579
sick people could get the medicine they

111
00:05:22,819 --> 00:05:27,439
need you know marijuana is a very useful

112
00:05:25,579 --> 00:05:31,159
medicine in many different conditions

113
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:34,339
it's been used for medicine going back

114
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:36,230
over 6,000 years the oldest written

115
00:05:34,339 --> 00:05:39,949
texts that talked about different

116
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:42,290
medicines one of the Vedas from northern

117
00:05:39,949 --> 00:05:44,569
India mention marijuana for many

118
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:46,760
different ailments yeah it's you know

119
00:05:44,569 --> 00:05:50,500
it's all throughout you know record

120
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:53,990
history we have all societies have used

121
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:55,100
cannabis as a medicine because they've

122
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:57,740
all found to be such a wonderful

123
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:59,930
medicine you know even in this century

124
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:02,420
here in the US we've used we've used it

125
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:06,189
as as a medicine and again the century

126
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:08,300
all through up to the 1920s it was until

127
00:06:06,189 --> 00:06:09,980
marijuana prohibition came in and then

128
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:11,960
we stopped using it as a medicine and

129
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:13,670
you know even now of course the final

130
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:16,849
government allows a few people to use it

131
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:19,970
as a medicine you know and before they

132
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:22,000
put a stop to it but it and it's you

133
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:25,220
know people have to use the entire herb

134
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,170
instead of just the the pill form where

135
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:29,870
the government says will work you know

136
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:31,790
the pill form is just one component of

137
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:34,340
marijuana and there are at least three

138
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:37,819
other medicinal components in marijuana

139
00:06:34,339 --> 00:06:40,839
outside of the pills what the pills have

140
00:06:37,819 --> 00:06:43,569
is THC or tetrahydrocannabinol

141
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:46,119
that's sold under the brand name Marinol

142
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:46,990
and that is just one of the components

143
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:50,889
the THC

144
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:57,668
there's also CBD and CBC and a couple of

145
00:06:50,889 --> 00:06:59,199
others CBD is a anti it's a dilator

146
00:06:57,668 --> 00:07:02,889
lowers blood pressure

147
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:05,819
it stops infections and it dilates blood

148
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:08,319
way so it lowers blood pressure and of

149
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:11,349
bronchial passageways so that's one of

150
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:13,990
the reasons that it's been useful as a

151
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:15,430
treatment for asthma even though smoking

152
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:17,889
something doesn't seem like it would be

153
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:19,660
good for asthma it is in fact been used

154
00:07:17,889 --> 00:07:24,430
traditionally for asthma because it

155
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:26,680
dries up the liquids and it also dilates

156
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:29,530
and makes larger the passageways and

157
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:31,660
then there CBC can a back row mean

158
00:07:29,529 --> 00:07:34,149
that's an anti [ __ ] agent it's not

159
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:39,000
psychoactive at all the way THC and CBD

160
00:07:34,149 --> 00:07:42,759
are both psychoactive or give you a

161
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:45,639
response that makes you high but CBC

162
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:49,060
isn't and it's an anti [ __ ] agent

163
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:52,000
that stops tremors people with multiple

164
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:54,490
sclerosis or other other problems find

165
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,168
it very very useful yeah it's you know

166
00:07:54,490 --> 00:08:00,150
it just goes to show that there's other

167
00:07:56,168 --> 00:08:03,310
these multitude of active agents in

168
00:08:00,149 --> 00:08:05,679
cannabis and you know it falls along

169
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:07,060
with a lot with what herbal medicine

170
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,459
people talk about when they say have

171
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:11,410
taken the entire herb for medicine that

172
00:08:09,459 --> 00:08:13,569
natural past talk about taking the

173
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:16,389
entire herb for the medicine and not

174
00:08:13,569 --> 00:08:18,250
just one single component looks what

175
00:08:16,389 --> 00:08:20,079
they wanted to do with Marinol because

176
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:22,120
that you know it's this plant has

177
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:25,029
evolved through literally thousands of

178
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:26,918
years and so it everything's together

179
00:08:25,029 --> 00:08:29,288
and we've used as medicine that way

180
00:08:26,918 --> 00:08:31,089
forever because one part balances out

181
00:08:29,288 --> 00:08:33,309
the other because you have an

182
00:08:31,089 --> 00:08:36,038
antispasmodic but you need to be able to

183
00:08:33,309 --> 00:08:38,500
transport that to all parts your body

184
00:08:36,038 --> 00:08:40,088
and so through it when it dilates it it

185
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:43,360
gets the blood flowing much more

186
00:08:40,089 --> 00:08:45,070
smoother through the body it transports

187
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,350
it to all parts the buys the muscles

188
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:49,570
easily a lot of these drugs they make

189
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:51,610
that we take from the chemical

190
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:53,320
pharmaceutical industry the problem is

191
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:55,870
how do we get it from

192
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:58,480
our stomachs if we if we swallow it to

193
00:08:55,870 --> 00:09:03,009
our muscles and that's the hardest part

194
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:04,930
they have is doing that or or some drugs

195
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:07,509
we inject whatever I think a look

196
00:09:04,929 --> 00:09:09,129
quicker but normally we just swallow all

197
00:09:07,509 --> 00:09:11,560
of our drugs from the pharmaceutical

198
00:09:09,129 --> 00:09:14,559
industry and it's not the same thing as

199
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:16,689
as inhaling something because it meets

200
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:18,698
that blood you know interface in the

201
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:20,860
lungs and then very easily is

202
00:09:18,698 --> 00:09:24,000
transported and what's and a very smooth

203
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:26,620
rough of the entire body it's true and

204
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,839
when you look at marinol which is just

205
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:30,879
that single component THC it doesn't

206
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:34,360
have the full effects of the entire

207
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:37,088
earth when you look at that pill the

208
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:40,690
small ones are 250 milligrams ones are

209
00:09:37,089 --> 00:09:43,540
six dollars each in pharmacies and the

210
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:47,019
larger ones thousand milligrams those

211
00:09:43,539 --> 00:09:49,559
are 15 dollars now if you're suffering

212
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:53,740
from chemotherapy as a treatment for

213
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:55,869
nausea and you have for cancer I mean

214
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:58,120
you have nausea you're gonna throw up

215
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:59,980
two or three of those pills before you

216
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,959
get it down and once you finally do get

217
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:03,819
one of those pills down because it has

218
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:06,309
to go through your intestinal tract it

219
00:10:03,818 --> 00:10:09,068
takes up to an hour to take effect where

220
00:10:06,309 --> 00:10:13,088
about less than a dime maybe a nickels

221
00:10:09,068 --> 00:10:16,269
worth of marijuana in a legal

222
00:10:13,089 --> 00:10:18,040
environment that to two puffs and you

223
00:10:16,269 --> 00:10:20,528
don't throw up those puffs obviously and

224
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:22,719
you're you've lost the nausea you're not

225
00:10:20,528 --> 00:10:25,509
throwing up you're not in agony anymore

226
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,639
and that's what the prohibition of

227
00:10:25,509 --> 00:10:30,039
marijuana as a medicine is doing you

228
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:32,110
know in California and Arizona they

229
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:35,708
passed medical marijuana initiatives

230
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:37,149
overwhelmingly and the federal

231
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:39,068
government has come in and said that

232
00:10:37,149 --> 00:10:42,009
they're gonna stop doctors from putting

233
00:10:39,068 --> 00:10:44,769
letting that go into effect well octa

234
00:10:42,009 --> 00:10:46,809
was written specifically to be upheld in

235
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:49,000
federal court so that the federal

236
00:10:46,809 --> 00:10:52,328
government can't stop it from taking

237
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,970
effect and by doing that we think that

238
00:10:52,328 --> 00:10:58,289
will allow patients to access medicine

239
00:10:54,970 --> 00:11:00,879
much more reasonably through pharmacies

240
00:10:58,289 --> 00:11:03,709
exactly we're gonna you know through

241
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:06,230
organ cams tax ID we're gonna say folks

242
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:09,190
you know it's gonna be sold at cost to

243
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:12,230
patients to people who have

244
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:14,990
prescriptions from you know their doctor

245
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:17,600
and so the doctor can you treat the

246
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:20,120
whole patient patient and not have to

247
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,830
worry about you know oh you know are you

248
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:23,149
be able to get the stuff illegally

249
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:25,310
because there are doctors out there who

250
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:28,399
will tell their patients with multiple

251
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:29,779
sclerosis that they have to you know you

252
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,129
know I can't give it to you and I can't

253
00:11:29,779 --> 00:11:34,250
really write it down but you really

254
00:11:31,129 --> 00:11:37,070
should try and you know smoke some

255
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:39,620
cannabis because it has beneficial

256
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:41,090
effects people multiple sclerosis and

257
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:43,250
those people they're those people if

258
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:45,259
they if they can smoke multiple if they

259
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:47,330
can smoke the cannabis they can live

260
00:11:45,259 --> 00:11:50,600
productive lives and they have no

261
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:52,940
problems holding down jobs and taking

262
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:56,240
care of their family taking care of

263
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:58,220
their home driving a car and all the

264
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:01,039
rest of it but they don't have to start

265
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:02,870
to get the spasms then they can't keep

266
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:05,599
their job they can't take care of their

267
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:08,179
family and you know and they're no

268
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:11,090
longer a productive member of society

269
00:12:08,179 --> 00:12:12,349
they become chlorin quote a burden and

270
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:14,810
you know the rest of us have to pay for

271
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:17,600
it and that's not what we want right you

272
00:12:14,809 --> 00:12:20,359
know our initiative would allow farmers

273
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:22,480
to grow the drug and then the central

274
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:26,029
state commission would distribute it and

275
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:28,550
taxed profit to adults in liquor stores

276
00:12:26,029 --> 00:12:30,049
those over the age of 21 I think that'll

277
00:12:28,549 --> 00:12:32,959
take it out of the hands of the black

278
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:35,179
market and remove the profit motive then

279
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:37,070
it will allow doctors to prescribe it

280
00:12:35,179 --> 00:12:39,709
through pharmacies now if you'd like to

281
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:41,780

see

295
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:24,800
rrh dot o-r-g and you know currently

296
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:27,469
those pills cost so much and we see the

297
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:31,639
people throwing up this Marinol when

298
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:34,300
just a small amount of cannabis in a

299
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:36,529
smoked form would ease their suffering

300
00:13:34,299 --> 00:13:39,229
immediately but the government doesn't

301
00:13:36,529 --> 00:13:42,139
want to see that happen they currently

302
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:46,190
classify marijuana as a schedule 1 drug

303
00:13:42,139 --> 00:13:48,199
with no medical benefits but studies

304
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:49,760
have been done in fact one of them was

305
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:53,540
published in Journal of internal

306
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:56,419
medicine where they surveyed oncologists

307
00:13:53,539 --> 00:13:59,329
or cancer doctors and in surveying those

308
00:13:56,419 --> 00:14:02,000
oncologists they asked them if marijuana

309
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:04,160
were legally available would you

310
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,950
prescribe it to your patients now these

311
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:10,339
oncologists are treating people who have

312
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:12,740
cancer and those doctors said 54% of

313
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:15,350
them said that yes they would prescribe

314
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:17,299
marijuana if it were medicinally

315
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:19,070
available why does the government think

316
00:14:17,299 --> 00:14:22,179
that it knows better than these

317
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:24,560
professional oncologists cancer doctors

318
00:14:22,179 --> 00:14:27,250
I think it's because they have an

319
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:30,799
economic interest in the continuation of

320
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:33,350
prohibition but those same doctors 54

321
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:35,629
percent said they would prescribe it 48

322
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:38,120
percent said they already had they'd

323
00:14:35,629 --> 00:14:39,830
already broken the law and recommended

324
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:42,710
that their patients use marijuana and

325
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:45,320
get it illegally and that was in a

326
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:47,480
survey of all of the oncologists across

327
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:49,100
the country yeah you know I think that's

328
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,990
just fabulous that these doctors are

329
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:53,540
being honest about it out there telling

330
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:55,100
her patients that look you know I can

331
00:14:53,539 --> 00:14:57,019
say I can't write a prescription for you

332
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:58,580
and I can't give you any but you should

333
00:14:57,019 --> 00:15:00,679
really think about this because I've had

334
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:02,389
other patients of mine come in and say

335
00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:05,689
yeah this is you know I've had all sorts

336
00:15:02,389 --> 00:15:07,850
of problems until I tried cannabis and

337
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:09,710
then it was wonderful and these people

338
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:12,590
who are sick I mean they're not out to

339
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:15,320
to get high or to get stoned cowan

340
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:17,780
unquote they're there to bail the field

341
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:19,490
better to build the function as a normal

342
00:15:17,779 --> 00:15:22,149
human being as a normal adult in our

343
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:24,470
society and that's what all of us want

344
00:15:22,149 --> 00:15:26,840
you know we all want to be able to

345
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:28,340
function the way we can to our best of

346
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,790
our abilities and to contribute to her

347
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:30,740
best of our

348
00:15:28,789 --> 00:15:33,139
abilities and our you know the

349
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:35,389
government just wants to control so much

350
00:15:33,139 --> 00:15:38,000
that they won't want they don't let us

351
00:15:35,389 --> 00:15:40,460
do that and this is a big thing on

352
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,750
control here the government you know

353
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:44,210
doesn't want us to think for ourselves

354
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:47,240
doesn't want people to realize that they

355
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:48,830
can get a drug for pennies literally

356
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:51,230
pennies that'll take care of lots of

357
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:52,820
problems I mean it's not a it's not a

358
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:55,340
drug it's not a cure-all it's on a

359
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:58,820
wonder drug it's just one one thing that

360
00:15:55,340 --> 00:16:01,250
can be used on the entire part you know

361
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:04,310
it for your health regime if you're ill

362
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:06,379
but it's it's definitely a good tool

363
00:16:04,309 --> 00:16:09,589
yeah it's one thing that doctors should

364
00:16:06,379 --> 00:16:11,570
have access to and currently doctors

365
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:13,580
have to break the law to recommend it to

366
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:15,560
patients and they realize that if they

367
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:18,230
prescribed this this little pill that's

368
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:20,599
available today that it's difficult for

369
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:23,450
people who have nausea or having spasms

370
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:25,820
to keep those pills down and those pills

371
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:28,759
are incredibly expensive their benefit

372
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:31,280
the pharmaceutical industries where by

373
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:32,990
putting marijuana at Causton pharmacies

374
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:35,959
which is what the Oregon cannabis Tax

375
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:37,879
Act will do it's going to make it a lot

376
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:39,889
cheaper for people who have these

377
00:16:37,879 --> 00:16:41,899
illnesses to deal with them and that's

378
00:16:39,889 --> 00:16:44,169
what we're trying to do you know in

379
00:16:41,899 --> 00:16:48,220
California and Arizona in November of

380
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:51,799
1996 those states overwhelmingly passed

381
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:55,399
marijuana medical initiatives the one in

382
00:16:51,799 --> 00:16:57,549
Arizona was actually backed by two

383
00:16:55,399 --> 00:16:59,870
former senators senator Barry Goldwater

384
00:16:57,549 --> 00:17:02,449
one of the founding fathers of

385
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:05,000
Republican conservatism and Senator

386
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:07,789
Dennis deconcini both of them back that

387
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,980
and then up in Washington State coming

388
00:17:07,789 --> 00:17:13,759
up this year just in another month and a

389
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:16,190
half now they have I 685 the drug

390
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:19,099
medicalization Act which will also allow

391
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:21,500
doctors to prescribe marijuana so if

392
00:17:19,099 --> 00:17:26,089

00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,319
get this on a ballot you know that's you

406
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:02,389
know another thing that this is all

407
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:04,009
about about your medical rights it's

408
00:18:02,388 --> 00:18:07,459
about your civil rights but you know

409
00:18:04,009 --> 00:18:09,349
choosing to be able to take whatever

410
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:11,720
medications you want the whole thing

411
00:18:09,349 --> 00:18:13,009
about marinelle and little pills if we

412
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:15,319
just stop and think about the for a

413
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:17,778
minute here's something that obviously

414
00:18:15,319 --> 00:18:19,220
works and these pharmaceutical companies

415
00:18:17,778 --> 00:18:21,259
know it works and the government knows

416
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:23,839
it works but instead of just allowing a

417
00:18:21,259 --> 00:18:25,278
plant they transform into a pill I mean

418
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:27,678
why would we why would you even need a

419
00:18:25,278 --> 00:18:29,659
pill when you already have a perfectly

420
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:32,120
good system out there for it

421
00:18:29,659 --> 00:18:34,970
it's just it just doesn't make any sense

422
00:18:32,119 --> 00:18:36,739
at all to me other than the fact that

423
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:38,740
you know obviously that people can make

424
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:41,599
money off at the pharmaceutical industry

425
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:45,109
but it's just so it just to me it just

426
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:48,709
any common sense you know that we don't

427
00:18:45,109 --> 00:18:50,808
need more surveys or tests to see where

428
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:53,298
it on marijuana works as a medicine we

429
00:18:50,808 --> 00:18:54,769
know it does otherwise why why Marinol

430
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:58,250
be out there why would our government

431
00:18:54,769 --> 00:19:00,859
allow Marinol to be prescribed so we

432
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:05,119
know it works yeah exactly it is a very

433
00:19:00,859 --> 00:19:09,199
useful medical preparation and and like

434
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:11,058
Paul Loney just pointed out this it's

435
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,889
quite hypocritical to say it doesn't

436
00:19:11,058 --> 00:19:14,599
have medical effects when they allow

437
00:19:12,888 --> 00:19:17,058
this pharmaceutical pill that's so

438
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:19,849
expensive to be out on the market when

439
00:19:17,058 --> 00:19:23,869
the inexpensive herb could replace it

440
00:19:19,849 --> 00:19:26,418
and we hope you'll get involved in the

441
00:19:23,869 --> 00:19:28,908
Oregon cannabis Tax Act and try to stop

442
00:19:26,419 --> 00:19:31,370
this madness help us put this on the

443
00:19:28,909 --> 00:19:36,019
ballot by giving us a call today

444
00:19:31,369 --> 00:19:38,628
right away at 2 3 5 4 6 so 6 yeah it's

445
00:19:36,019 --> 00:19:42,109
just amazing I mean the if you do any

446
00:19:38,628 --> 00:19:44,538
kind of research at all out there what

447
00:19:42,109 --> 00:19:46,519
the benefits are in Jamaica you know

448
00:19:44,538 --> 00:19:48,179
where there's a lot of Rastafarians that

449
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:50,700
smoke a lot of

450
00:19:48,179 --> 00:19:53,120
cannabis you know it's part of their

451
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:55,769
religion they're the the women there

452
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:58,439
they have better childbirths they have

453
00:19:55,769 --> 00:20:01,529
less time and labor their babies come

454
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:03,150
out weighing more which is always a good

455
00:20:01,529 --> 00:20:04,798
sign doctors say oh it's always good

456
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:07,350
when doctors wait I mean babies weigh

457
00:20:04,798 --> 00:20:09,599
more it's a sign of healthy baby

458
00:20:07,349 --> 00:20:12,298
these rasta firing women they have

459
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:14,699
shorter Labor's less a lot less

460
00:20:12,298 --> 00:20:17,490
traumatic a lot less incidences of

461
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:21,080
having to do cesarean sections the

462
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:23,669
babies are healthier when they're born

463
00:20:21,079 --> 00:20:25,889
you know less problems in the first few

464
00:20:23,669 --> 00:20:27,150
months their lives that you know that

465
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:29,429
you hear about you know with other

466
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:31,470
babies and it's just it's just amazing

467
00:20:29,429 --> 00:20:34,350
and they're you know where are these

468
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:36,419
people you know consumed what the rest

469
00:20:34,349 --> 00:20:38,219
was probably think uh I've seen amount

470
00:20:36,419 --> 00:20:40,759
of cannabis but you know they don't have

471
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:43,200
any problems with it yeah the

472
00:20:40,759 --> 00:20:46,140
Rastafarians are known to smoke ounces

473
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:48,980
maybe even four ounces a day if they

474
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:54,390
have access to it they smoke it in large

475
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:56,519
cigars and and quite frequently and they

476
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:58,410
find that that doesn't have a bad effect

477
00:20:56,519 --> 00:21:00,418
in the studies they've done in Jamaica

478
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:03,720
and they've done some pretty significant

479
00:21:00,419 --> 00:21:07,890
in-depth studies in Jamaica a couple

480
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:09,690
filling up a couple of books so to say

481
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:12,809
that there isn't research showing that

482
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:15,029
medical marijuana is beneficial he's

483
00:21:12,808 --> 00:21:17,519
just a lie and it's a self-serving live

484
00:21:15,029 --> 00:21:22,109
by those who say that because they want

485
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:24,150
to make more money and when you look at

486
00:21:22,109 --> 00:21:26,269
the the marinol pills that are out there

487
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:28,860
today they're obscenely expensive

488
00:21:26,269 --> 00:21:31,440
fifteen dollars up to fifteen dollars

489
00:21:28,859 --> 00:21:33,689
for a pill which is be a nickels worth

490
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,820
of marijuana so you can see the economic

491
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:37,558
incentive they have to keep doing what

492
00:21:35,819 --> 00:21:39,659
they're doing yeah it's just a huge

493
00:21:37,558 --> 00:21:41,970
incentive and you know the fact that

494
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:43,980
with the Rasta firing women down there

495
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:47,279
in Jamaica I mean they're taking the

496
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:49,620
dosage in the way that a naturopathic

497
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:51,928
doctor would want you to or any doctor

498
00:21:49,619 --> 00:21:53,819
if they stopped and thought about it you

499
00:21:51,929 --> 00:21:56,460
know they all airway down they smoke it

500
00:21:53,819 --> 00:21:57,829
at their own pace it's not like okay I'm

501
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:59,750
going to smoke you know

502
00:21:57,829 --> 00:22:01,789
this huge amount in the next half an

503
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:04,789
hour no it just you just do it at your

504
00:22:01,789 --> 00:22:06,769
own pace everybody has their own pace it

505
00:22:04,789 --> 00:22:08,509
depends on your own body and so that's

506
00:22:06,769 --> 00:22:10,039
there it's a very good delivery system

507
00:22:08,509 --> 00:22:11,960
because they know what their body is

508
00:22:10,039 --> 00:22:14,690
going through that moment and what it

509
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:16,279
needs and what it doesn't need and

510
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:17,870
they're you know with a British

511
00:22:16,279 --> 00:22:20,029
government controlling Jamaica for so

512
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:21,819
long down there they did all sorts of

513
00:22:20,029 --> 00:22:24,889
research because they're worried about

514
00:22:21,819 --> 00:22:26,179
cameras getting into Britain and you

515
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:28,700
know like Paul said there was no

516
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:30,980
problems down there at all and they've

517
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:33,049
had very few problems back in Britain

518
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:36,700
itself when cannabis got back there big

519
00:22:33,049 --> 00:22:39,349
time so is a very very it's a very

520
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:41,210
benign substance in so many ways but

521
00:22:39,349 --> 00:22:43,189
it's also very helpful helpful benign

522
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:45,680
substance if that's not an oxymoron yeah

523
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:48,259
there's actually a new study that's

524
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:51,440
being done in Britain to examine the

525
00:22:48,259 --> 00:22:53,920
anti [ __ ] qualities of cannabis how

526
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:57,230
it stops people were undergoing

527
00:22:53,920 --> 00:23:00,590
convulsions and spasms from things such

528
00:22:57,230 --> 00:23:02,960
as multiple sclerosis specifically it is

529
00:23:00,589 --> 00:23:06,289
a test of multiple sclerosis patients

530
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:08,600
that's just beginning in Great Britain

531
00:23:06,289 --> 00:23:10,279
and there are many different medical

532
00:23:08,599 --> 00:23:12,500
studies that are taking place the United

533
00:23:10,279 --> 00:23:15,139
States government has just sponsored a

534
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:17,150
new set of studies into the medical

535
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:20,150
benefits but that's no reason to

536
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:23,120
prohibit it today because it is useful

537
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:26,090
it's been used medicinally for thousands

538
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:27,679
of years but now it's prohibited and I

539
00:23:26,089 --> 00:23:30,619
really believe the only reason it's

540
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:32,810
prohibited is because it's economically

541
00:23:30,619 --> 00:23:34,729
benefits small groups of people and

542
00:23:32,809 --> 00:23:36,559
those people want to make certain that

543
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:39,380
they continue making all the money they

544
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:43,000
can make and buy it helps them to do

545
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:45,470
that that by making marijuana illegal

546
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:48,890
exactly it would take away another

547
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:50,930
profit Center for them if all these

548
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:52,730
drugs were no longer available or you

549
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:54,769
know people wouldn't buy the drugs and

550
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:57,079
they can easily go down to their local

551
00:23:54,769 --> 00:23:59,569
pharmacy and pick up Venessa no

552
00:23:57,079 --> 00:24:01,069
marijuana it would take a big profit

553
00:23:59,569 --> 00:24:04,128
center out of all the pharmaceuticals

554
00:24:01,069 --> 00:24:05,928
and they'd be real upset about it

555
00:24:04,128 --> 00:24:08,058
and that's why the pharmaceutical

556
00:24:05,929 --> 00:24:10,249
companies are backing partnership for a

557
00:24:08,058 --> 00:24:12,470
drug-free America no partnership for

558
00:24:10,249 --> 00:24:14,089
drug-free America does almost two

559
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:17,118
million dollars worth of advertising

560
00:24:14,089 --> 00:24:19,548
every day and 95 percent of those ads

561
00:24:17,118 --> 00:24:21,769
talk about marijuana and how bad

562
00:24:19,548 --> 00:24:23,898
marijuana is but when you look at the

563
00:24:21,769 --> 00:24:26,089
companies that are actually putting that

564
00:24:23,898 --> 00:24:27,678
information out there the companies that

565
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:30,678
sponsor partnership for drug-free

566
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:32,869
America it's not a big surprise to see

567
00:24:30,679 --> 00:24:35,149
that it's a lot of pharmaceutical drug

568
00:24:32,868 --> 00:24:38,269
companies and beer companies primarily

569
00:24:35,148 --> 00:24:40,278
its pharmaceutical drug companies beer

570
00:24:38,269 --> 00:24:43,069
companies and companies with an interest

571
00:24:40,278 --> 00:24:45,679
in the police industrial complex

572
00:24:43,069 --> 00:24:48,528
companies like Wackenhut that operate

573
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:50,749
independent privatized prisons they are

574
00:24:48,528 --> 00:24:53,358
one of the big supporters of partnership

575
00:24:50,749 --> 00:24:56,808
for a drug-free America Eli Lilly the

576
00:24:53,358 --> 00:24:59,028
people who synthesize Marinol synthetic

577
00:24:56,808 --> 00:25:00,589
marijuana and make fifteen dollars a

578
00:24:59,028 --> 00:25:03,409
pill they are one of the big sponsors

579
00:25:00,589 --> 00:25:05,028
anheuser-busch the beer makers they're

580
00:25:03,409 --> 00:25:07,309
one of the big sponsors all of these

581
00:25:05,028 --> 00:25:10,819
people have a big economic interest in

582
00:25:07,308 --> 00:25:13,579
prohibition and that's why marijuana is

583
00:25:10,819 --> 00:25:18,249
illegal today it isn't about drugs it's

584
00:25:13,579 --> 00:25:21,319
about money yeah it's not about you know

585
00:25:18,249 --> 00:25:24,139
the evils of marijuana the evils of

586
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:26,298
cannabis it's about civil rights and

587
00:25:24,138 --> 00:25:29,928
civil liberties that's it's the freedoms

588
00:25:26,298 --> 00:25:31,608
that we have out there for us and be

589

choose our own recreational drugs choose

591
00:25:34,128 --> 00:25:39,079
our own products that we can grow and

592
00:25:36,138 --> 00:25:42,469
the Oregon campus Tax Act will allow us

593
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:45,408
to do that you know so give us a call at

sign this petition and just to get it on

606
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:16,410
a ballot that's we're asking is to have

607
00:26:14,628 --> 00:26:20,069
a choice in the ballot November 9th

608

have a choice afterwards because no

610
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:26,009
one's gonna force anybody to take

611
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:27,269
marijuana is a medicine you know we

612
00:26:26,009 --> 00:26:28,650
won't be you know Mary and I will still

613
00:26:27,269 --> 00:26:30,750
be there for those who want to you know

614
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:32,580
pay that big bucks but for those who

615
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:34,650
don't marijuana will be there as a

616
00:26:32,579 --> 00:26:35,970
medicine that's all we're asking and

617
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:38,580
that's all hoping that you'll help us

618
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:40,200
enjoy it it's doing that the Oregon

619
00:26:38,579 --> 00:26:44,129
cannabis Tax Act would allow medical

620
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:45,930
marijuana and prescriptions through

621
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:48,720
pharmacies with doctors it would also

622
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:51,390
allow people to grow their own it would

623
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:54,299
limit the recreational use to those over

624
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:56,009
the age of 21 and it would raise

625
00:26:54,299 --> 00:26:59,190
hundreds and millions of dollars in

626
00:26:56,009 --> 00:27:02,609
taxes would also legalize industrial

627
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:04,980
hemp because marijuana cannabis hemp

628
00:27:02,609 --> 00:27:07,979
produces more fiber produces more

629
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:09,420
protein produces more oil than any other

630
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:11,220
plant on our planet

631
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:13,140
I truly believe that's another one of

632
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:15,960
the key factors that marijuana is

633
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:18,390
illegal for today it would produce more

634
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:19,980
of these products and the companies that

635
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:22,170
produce those don't want to have to

636
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:24,930
compete with him so we want to urge you

637
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:26,460
to give us a call get the petition get

638
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:28,259
some signatures you know it might be

639
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:30,960
intimidating because on these petitions

640
00:27:28,259 --> 00:27:32,400
there are 15 signature lines you don't

641
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,170
have to fill up the whole petition

642
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:36,750
though in fact if you just want to sign

643
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:38,759
one name on there and send it back in to

644
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:41,220
us please do but once you've gotten your

645
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:43,349
signatures don't hold on to them send

646
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:45,870
them back in to us right away we will

647
00:27:43,349 --> 00:27:48,299
hopefully turn this in early we have

648
00:27:45,869 --> 00:27:51,209
until next July of 1998 to get the

649
00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:53,940
signatures but we want to get them in as

650
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:55,920
