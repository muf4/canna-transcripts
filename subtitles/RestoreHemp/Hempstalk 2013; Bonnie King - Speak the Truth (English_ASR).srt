1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,009
in 2003 i think i met dr. Phil davec I

2
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:12,780
know a lot of you guys know dr. Leveque

3
00:00:08,009 --> 00:00:14,519
if you don't this is dr. Leveque says

4
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:16,679
closest I could get today because he

5
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:20,189
just couldn't make it so this is almost

6
00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:22,050
life point he's really a tall guy anyhow

7
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:25,948
if he was here he'd have all kinds of

8
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:29,490
advice to give to you um all good advice

9
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:32,880
doc lévêque was one of the main guys it

10
00:00:29,489 --> 00:00:37,500
helped the law of initiative in 1998

11
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:40,890
become a reality he had problems with

12
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:44,219
the Oregon Medical Board because he

13
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:46,230
signed more patients authorizations than

14
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:49,770
any other doctor in the state of Oregon

15
00:00:46,229 --> 00:00:53,429
so good for him he helped 5,000 patients

16
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:55,320
before they took him out in 2004 so he

17
00:00:53,429 --> 00:00:57,390
had five good years that he helped all

18
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:00,420
these people a thousand of them are

19
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:02,460
veterans and we hear from them every day

20
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:05,219
we hear from them at Salem News calm

21
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:08,310
because he's a regular writer for us so

22
00:01:05,219 --> 00:01:10,938
he's a really special guy he turned 90

23
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:14,728
years old I just a couple of months ago

24
00:01:10,938 --> 00:01:17,459
and he's still going strong so you'll

25
00:01:14,728 --> 00:01:19,618
see him around and he writes for us two

26
00:01:17,459 --> 00:01:22,589
three four times a week so catch his

27
00:01:19,618 --> 00:01:26,750
stuff on salem news com he covers PTSD

28
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:29,579
and a lot of toxicology he is a forensic

29
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:31,438
toxicologists and a pharmacologist one

30
00:01:29,578 --> 00:01:35,250
of the only ones in the state of Oregon

31
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:38,399
and so though he can't sign applications

32
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:40,709
anymore he can still talk about what he

33
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,530
knows to be true fact which is that

34
00:01:40,709 --> 00:01:45,839
cannabis cures and he knows the true

35
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:47,879
such as we all do so I just wanted to

36
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,549
share that with you that doc does wish

37
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:53,129
that he could be here and on his behalf

38
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:56,630
I'd like to say what he would of course

39
00:01:53,129 --> 00:01:59,539
leave you with don't smoke in the rain

40
00:01:56,629 --> 00:02:00,828
anyway you guys are in family and we

41
00:01:59,539 --> 00:02:04,728
always think of the cannabis community

42
00:02:00,828 --> 00:02:06,199
as a community and I want you to look at

43
00:02:04,728 --> 00:02:08,359
each other and realize you know this

44
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:10,310
isn't a bad this is you know we don't

45
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:12,620
want to look at each other as people

46
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:15,259
that we only run into at places like

47
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:17,930
this because it's a cool place to hang

48
00:02:15,259 --> 00:02:20,239
out we do this all the time you're an

49
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:22,150
activist if you believe in Indian

50
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:25,009
prohibition then you need to believe it

51
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:27,080
24-7 so look at each other as your

52
00:02:25,009 --> 00:02:29,899
brothers and sisters we need to take

53
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:33,019
care of each other keep each other out

54
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:35,439
