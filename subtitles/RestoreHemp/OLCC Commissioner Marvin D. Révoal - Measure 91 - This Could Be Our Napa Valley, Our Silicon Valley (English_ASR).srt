1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,669
good afternoon everyone my name is

2
00:00:01,318 --> 00:00:04,679
Barbara Bowl and i represent

3
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:08,609
congressional district number four which

4
00:00:04,679 --> 00:00:12,629
is lame county a central part of the

5
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:14,308
state congressman defazio area I'm

6
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:16,350
excited about what's going on right now

7
00:00:14,308 --> 00:00:17,788
my commercial brokerage insurance

8
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,210
brokerages that we have office and

9
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:22,109
Portland Eugene so I get to see a lot of

10
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:24,420
businesses small businesses like

11
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:26,970
business I happen to believe that this

12
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:29,640
could be our Napa Valley our silicon

13
00:00:26,969 --> 00:00:36,089
valley if we do it right and we really

14
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:38,579
or the main component right I think that

15
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:42,510
the rest of the country is looking at

16
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:44,789
Oregon right now we have our number

17
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:46,469
three there been some mistakes that have

18
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:49,079
been made in the other two states we're

19
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:50,850
hoping to avoid those we want to hear

20
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:53,250
from you we're going to start making

21
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:56,039
rules later on this year with the idea

22
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:58,049
that this becomes an economic engine and

23
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:00,120
one of the goals that that I have is

24
00:00:58,049 --> 00:01:02,939
that in the coming year this next

25
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:04,530
biennium the organ liquor control is

26
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:07,920
going to deliver to the state of Oregon

27
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:11,219
1.2 billion dollars that's what liquor

28
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:13,890
wine and beer does to the state remember

29
00:01:11,219 --> 00:01:16,259
we don't have a consumption tax so you

30
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:18,390
know I want to be excited to one day say

31
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:21,329
guess what the cannabis industry

32
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:23,219
produced 1.2 billion dollars to the

33
00:01:21,329 --> 00:01:27,650
state of Oregon and maybe we can build a

34
00:01:23,219 --> 00:01:27,650
library once in a while so thank you
