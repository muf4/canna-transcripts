1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,080
and what have we learned from Colorado

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,080
and Washington and what have these two

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:09,120
states done especially well or poorly

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:13,679
from what you've

5
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:15,838
seen sure I think that uh in Washington

6
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,560
uh the bill was fairly poor it doesn't

7
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:21,518
allow people to grow their own it does

8
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:24,759
it Limits The Possession to an ounce if

9
00:00:21,518 --> 00:00:26,879
you have uh over 28 gram in Washington

10
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:30,880
you're have a misdemeanor if you have

11
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:34,000
over 40 GRS you'll go to jail so this is

12
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:36,238
dramatically better than that and uh in

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,759
Colorado they have a particularly

14
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:42,119
onerous system of Regulation that

15
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:44,799
requires video cameras on the grow site

16
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:47,519
from seed to sale with a video feed to

17
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:50,399
the state store it's definitely over

18
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:55,039
regulated uh we've seen prices of $7 and

19
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:58,039
$800 an ounce in Washington and uh

20
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,480
several hundred an ounce in Colorado

21
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:03,000
we're not going to wipe out the black

22
00:00:59,479 --> 00:01:07,640
market those prices folks I think uh

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,200
initiative 53 will do that and uh a $35

24
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:12,118
an ounce tax is certainly reasonable and

25
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:15,118
I think it's a lot

26
00:01:12,118 --> 00:01:15,118
better
