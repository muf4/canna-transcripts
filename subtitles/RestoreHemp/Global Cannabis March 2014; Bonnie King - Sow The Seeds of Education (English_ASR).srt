1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,769
certain people have made these things

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:06,690
possible in the cannabis community we

3
00:00:04,769 --> 00:00:09,029
have so many cannabis warriors that have

4
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:11,880
come before us that don't get nearly

5
00:00:09,029 --> 00:00:13,859
enough attention and all of us gets come

6
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,900
out here and march around and we have

7
00:00:13,859 --> 00:00:18,899
our cheers and our chance and our flags

8
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:21,600
and we need to do it all the time but

9
00:00:18,899 --> 00:00:24,599
years ago there were only a few people

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,779
that had the guts to do this and we need

11
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:30,210
to give them mama John a day like today

12
00:00:26,778 --> 00:00:32,429
