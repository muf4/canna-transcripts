420 but uh we're here to Mark important

22
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:05,920
occasion you know we want to see hemp

23
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:08,960
restored hemp is one of the oldest crops

24
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:11,118
grown by people everybody agrees that

25
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:12,798
marijuana was among the first few crops

26
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:17,200
that people started growing at least

27
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:19,759
12,000 years ago and it produces more

28
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,680
food protein that meets human

29
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:25,319
nutritional needs better than any other

30
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:28,439
protein out there it produces more fuel

31
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:31,199
biodiesel fuel from its seeds and

32
00:01:28,438 --> 00:01:33,239
ethanol from its leaves and stocks and

33
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,478
from these hemp stocks and this is the

34
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:38,759
official Hemp stock of Hemp stock here 3

35
00:01:35,478 --> 00:01:42,640
years old it from the stocks it produces

36
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:45,879
more paper more fiber more building

37
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:49,319
materials than any other plant

38
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:51,239
so uh we're here to legalize him and

39
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:53,118
we're doing it through an initiative

40
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:55,118

420 well you know it's it's less than a

60
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:43,399
minute away according to my clock so uh

61
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:47,479
you know we're here for freedom and

62
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:50,519
liberty too you know our right to our

63
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:53,000
freedom of Consciousness to be happy

64
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:55,400
here on this planet is one of the other

65
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,639
things we're fighting for you know right

66
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:01,719
now there's really a rapid growth in

67
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:04,039
genetic technology and Gene information

68
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:06,919
there's rapid growth in nanotechnology

69
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:09,239
as they miniaturize all sorts of things

70
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:11,798
there's a rapid growth in artificial

71
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:14,519
intelligence within a lot of our

72
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:16,799
lifetimes lot most of of you guys out

73
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:19,280
there uh computers are going to be

74
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:22,280
pretty darn smart and if we don't

75
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:25,080
protect individual rights then the

76
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:28,239
future is dire you know things like the

77
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:31,680
Matrix and the Terminator are

78
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:33,799
possibilities so we have to protect our

79
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,959
right freedom of Consciousness and

80
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:39,200
expand natural individual rights and I

81
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:42,560
think marijuana is a bell weather issue

82
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:44,560
on that the the fact that they've taken

83
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:47,239
the oldest crop the one that produces

84
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,560
more fuel more food more fiber and more

85
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:51,079
medicine than any other plant and they

86
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,920
made that one

87
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:55,319
illegal it's

88
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:57,839
wrong so we're going to have to get

89
00:03:55,318 --> 00:04:01,399
active I'm counting on you happy

90
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:07,199
420 and uh

91
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:07,200
we'll be back restore him
