1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,160
thank you keith thank you everybody for

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,799
being here and uh bear in mind that

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:10,000
that's our former police chief

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:11,839
that you heard uh taking that position

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,120
by the way john and so um yeah it's

6
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:16,160
great to be here today it's a really

7
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:18,160
exciting time uh and i'm very um

8
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,320
optimistic about prop 19 passing right

9
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,079
now let me start off by saying what the

10
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,079
state of california law is to give you a

11
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:25,439
grasp of where things stand right now

12
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:28,000
basically marijuana is illegal in

13
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,879
california there is a

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,920
qualified limited immunity that people

15
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:36,719
have if they get a doctor's approval

16
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:39,920
and that is an immunity that allows them

17
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,439
theoretically to have eight ounces or

18
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,879
six plants

19
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:45,199
and be immune from a rest if they have

20
00:00:42,878 --> 00:00:46,799
the right paperwork otherwise they're in

21
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,719
court fighting it out and a lot of times

22
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:50,159
the problem is the paperwork the cop

23
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,320
doesn't believe doesn't like the doctor

24
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:54,159
doesn't believe it's

25
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,679
undone in time and so forth whatever

26
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:57,198
their issues are that they have against

27
00:00:55,679 --> 00:01:00,558
the paperwork becomes a big factor in

28
00:00:57,198 --> 00:01:02,238
this whole thing um but sb4 prop 215

29
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:04,478
created the limited qualified immunity

30
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:06,478
sp 420 created an opportunity for

31
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:09,118
collectives to grow in and

32
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:12,000
it also set up the safe harbor for use

33
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:14,159
but basically it created a legal defense

34
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,599
against sales of marijuana which right

35
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,520
now we have this dispensary system in

36
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:19,280
california which is not based upon them

37
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:21,039
saying it's legal to sell marijuana is

38
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,680
to say that if you get it busted that

39
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,840
you have a legal defense in court for

40
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,280
marijuana

41
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,680
it is a felony to furnish for people

42
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,680
below the age of 18 in california it's a

43
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,520
misdemeanor to possess marijuana to

44
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,680
transport marijuana it is a felony to

45
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:38,640
cultivate marijuana that felony can be

46
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,880
mitigated by a pc-1000

47
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,359
deferred uh entry of judgment which

48
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:44,640
means that the judge is nice to you that

49
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:46,078
you might be able to get out there

50
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,399
without having a permanently scarred

51
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:50,639
record other than having been arrested

52
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,960
because they can dispose of the pc uh

53
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,478
excuse me of your cultivation bust

54
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:57,438
as was mentioned earlier something like

55
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:59,039
56 percent of uh californians think

56
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:00,959
marijuana should be legal when you look

57
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,840
at the polling what we have right now

58
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:04,199
the

59
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:07,280
average of the last seven polls comes to

60
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:10,560
51.3 percent or who are in favor of the

61
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:12,159
initiative um as written so uh what this

62
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,080
means that is that our opponents are now

63
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:16,239
in the position where they will say that

64
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,840
they're not in favor of the drug war

65
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,439
they're not in favor of marijuana being

66
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,280
illegal they just think this is the

67
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:23,199
wrong initiative and then they will give

68
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,959
you two reasons of why they think it is

69
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:26,238
wrong or more they have you know they

70
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,439
can make up fake stuff as much as they

71
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:30,000
want obviously

72
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:31,359
uh so um so i'm going to pass on that

73
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,199
for a moment and get back to that minute

74
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,519
because what i want to go to next is how

75
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:37,280
do we arrive at prop 19 in the form that

76
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,879
is written right now the origins and

77
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,080
concept come from the fact that there

78
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:42,639
were four initiatives that were being

79
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,400
crafted in california last year

80
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:46,238
one of them was a california cannabis

81
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,159
initiative which was a full legalization

82
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,680
initiative the other was the california

83
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:51,598
hemp and health initiative jack harris

84
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,040
initiative uh the other one was called

85
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:54,399
the common sense initiative a couple

86
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:55,598
guys in long beach who just said it's

87
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,560
time to do something and they didn't

88
00:02:55,598 --> 00:02:57,439
know they didn't have a group they

89
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,560
didn't have anything they just wrote

90
00:02:57,439 --> 00:02:59,919
something that said it's common sense to

91
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,360
legalize marijuana so therefore we

92
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:03,119
should do it

93
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,920
basically with their initiative and then

94
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,200
we have proposition 19. now as you

95
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:09,280
notice only one of those is called

96
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:10,958
proposition that's because of the four

97
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,719
one made it onto the ballot my wife

98
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,800
mickey norris here

99
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:18,120
who's a co-publisher of the west coast

100
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,120
leaf with me

101
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:22,719
she and i were engaged in the writing of

102
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,000
three of those initiatives and what we

103
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:25,359
people said to us so which one do you

104
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,919
support and what we said is we support

105
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,680
the one that gets on the ballot

106
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:31,679
because the other ones you know it's

107
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,680
they're great ideas maybe but they're

108
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,200
not on the ballot and so it seems pretty

109
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,120
clear to me how you have to address that

110
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:38,798
kind of a situation however not everyone

111
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,878
felt about that way

112
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:43,760
and so i'm here to tell you that this

113
00:03:40,878 --> 00:03:46,239
initiative is very very very very very

114
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:47,759
carefully written it was initiated from

115
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,280
material was put together by criminal

116
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:51,039
lawyers then it went to uh

117
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,158
constitutional lawyers then it went to

118
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:56,798
election lawyers there was a group of uh

119
00:03:54,158 --> 00:03:58,318
citizens such as myself and mickey and

120
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,000
many of the leaders of the movement were

121
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:01,839
invited to participate and they said

122
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,199
they did not want to because they felt

123
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,640
this was the wrong year and if they held

124
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:06,079
off for two years then they would get

125
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:07,598
involved but they wouldn't get involved

126
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,719
now we took the different approach we

127
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:09,919
said if there's something on the ballot

128
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:11,759
i want to have something

129
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:13,438
input on what it's like and so then a

130
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:14,479
lot of people are resentful for us to us

131
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:15,519
because of well how come we were

132
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:17,039
consulting they weren't and the answer

133
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:18,720
is because we took the time and went to

134
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,720
the meetings and they didn't that's what

135
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,320
happened there and so those means were

136
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,479
extremely interesting because this

137
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:26,319
initiative was designed to do several

138
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:28,478
things one is to preserve the existing

139
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:29,680
medical marijuana laws the attorneys

140
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:31,039
have told us originally as long as you

141
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,478
don't mention

142
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,520
yeah

143
00:04:32,478 --> 00:04:34,879
so they said as long as we didn't

144
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:36,478
mention the medical marijuana laws that

145
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:37,360
they were automatically preserved and as

146
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:38,800
long as we didn't put them in the

147
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,479
section it says these are the laws that

148
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,160
are changed it would not be changed but

149
00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:44,639
we said that's not enough we put in the

150
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,400
purposes three times that it protects

151
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,160
the medical marijuana laws in california

152
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:50,319
and in the ballot argument it says one

153
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,680
time that we're preserving those laws so

154
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:53,199
the idea that it's changing those is

155
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,040
completely wrong was written to protect

156
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,800
the medical marijuana laws and in fact

157
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,639
to go beyond it because the current

158
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,400
medical marijuanas do not make it clear

159
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,720
that you can sell medical marijuana

160
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:05,198
whereas prop 19 says you can sell

161
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,320
marijuana if you if the city authorizes

162
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,720
it and so the question of the

163
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:10,639
dispensaries will be resolved

164
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,800
clearly that you can sell marijuana in

165
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:15,120
california for medical uses after prop

166
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,960
19 passes which is not clear right now

167
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,800
is still being fought out in courts

168
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:21,038
the other thing is that it's a modest

169
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,319
goal rather than legalizing unlimited

170
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:23,759
amounts of marijuana for anybody to use

171
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:25,680
all the time in any place and share with

172
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:28,080
anybody of any age they wrote something

173
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,478
that said it limits to one ounce

174
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:32,000
and you have a affirmative defense to if

175
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:34,079
you have more than an ounce and the

176
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,519
legislature can increase the quantities

177
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:36,879
available and the legislature can

178
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:38,719
continue to make further changes to

179
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:40,719
improve the initiative by reducing

180
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,560
penalties and reducing restrictions but

181
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,000
not by going the other way not by adding

182
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,079
new penalties doesn't give them that

183
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,279
authority it doesn't get and it and so

184
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:48,800
um

185
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:51,119
so and it also makes a very small

186
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,400
personal grow legal what that means

187
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,160
changed during the course of our

188
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:55,519
discussion originally it was a

189
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,439
reasonable amount then it became maybe

190
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:59,038
100 square feet then it went down to 50

191
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:00,478
square feet then it went down to 32

192
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:03,279
square feet and what we found out is

193
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:05,918
that the people who don't grow marijuana

194
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:08,719
think that that is a lot of marijuana

195
00:06:05,918 --> 00:06:10,318
and so so richard came to the 25 square

196
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,919
feet and the legislature can increase

197
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,759
that um

198
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:15,439
initially i was very against that but i

199
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,199
think that with the affirmative defense

200
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:18,399
that you can defend bigger gardens and

201
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:20,240
so that's not really going to be a

202
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:21,839
problem that just means if you can stay

203
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,319
within 25 square feet you don't get

204
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:26,959
arrested uh and the other thing is that

205
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:29,439
it allows local regulations

206
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:32,159
without putting in a state law that

207
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:33,759
regulates the uh the sales of marijuana

208
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,120
this is what our constitutional lawyers

209
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,720
told us we had to do they said if we

210
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,319
made a law that california had to break

211
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,160
federal law that that would be ruled

212
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,600
unconstitutional immediately what we can

213
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,919
do is say that the state is stepping

214
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,360
aside and it's going to allow the cities

215
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:47,279
to do the same kind of regulation that

216
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,319
they do over the gas station the barber

217
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:52,399
shop the grocery store the drugstore the

218
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,639
liquor store the tobacco outlets the

219
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:55,918
same kind of regulation and of course

220
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,280
that offended a lot of people because

221
00:06:55,918 --> 00:06:58,478
they felt like marijuana is not supposed

222
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:00,000
to be regulated it's supposed to be

223
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:02,000
something different

224
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,918
but our sense of what we got to through

225
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,598
the polls was this that the voters were

226
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:07,279
in favor of legalization but they don't

227
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:09,199
like the alcohol model because they

228
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:10,879
think it's not controlled well enough

229
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,720
they wanted more controls over marijuana

230
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:14,399
than over alcohol and we might say well

231
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,919
marijuana safer but that's not what the

232
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:17,359
voters want to hear they want to hear

233
00:07:15,918 --> 00:07:19,598
that we have written a law that produces

234
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,360
more controls and so those controls were

235
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:23,439
put in there specifically to do a couple

236
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,319
of things one of them being that it

237
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:26,959
would

238
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:29,199
make 18 to 20 years old equi

239
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:31,758
excuse me sales or transfers to people

240
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:34,240
between the ages 18 and 21 we kept all

241
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:36,879
the criminal penalties for cells to

242
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,840
minors below 18 and 14. those remained

243
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:39,199
intact

244
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:41,279
same as they always have been there's no

245
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:43,280
new felony in this at all

246
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:44,879
but what it did do is it made it tougher

247
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:47,359
penalty for selling to people between

248
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:49,759
the 18 18 and 21

249
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,280
made it equivalent to the alcohol model

250
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,639
uh and it said that we have to keep it

251
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:54,079
away from kids and it did in kind of an

252
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,720
ambiguous way is that you can't it

253
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:58,639
doesn't legalize smoking around people

254
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,080
around minors

255
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:01,519
so it didn't make a new penalty it

256
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:03,359
didn't change the law about it it said

257
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:06,079
that it didn't specifically make it

258
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,960
legal to do that uh and so we basically

259
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:10,318
so you still have your misdemeanor uh

260
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:13,359
furnishing

261
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:15,039
charge uh but

262
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,639
and the medical is still protected but

263
00:08:15,038 --> 00:08:18,719
if you're distributing people under the

264
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,000
age of between 1821 you might actually

265
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,000
have the possibility of prison time it's

266
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,439
not a guaranteed prison time excuse me

267
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,598
jail time there is no prison time i said

268
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:27,199
that completely wrong this is only jail

269
00:08:25,598 --> 00:08:27,918
it does not create any prison time at

270
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,199
all

271
00:08:27,918 --> 00:08:30,159
uh

272
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,759
and the other thing that people are

273
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,200
concerned about let me reiterate that no

274
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,240
prison time

275
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,278
because i know that's going to come back

276
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,479
and haunt me the fact that i said the

277
00:08:35,278 --> 00:08:37,599
wrong word

278
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,719
that's the way that it works in this

279
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:42,240
movement okay so uh and the financial

280
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,519
argument raises the nights very well

281
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,879
although people don't really expect it

282
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,240
to pay off the way it sounds like it

283
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:47,039
will because they remember the lottery

284
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,879
and it didn't pay off the way they

285
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:50,719
thought it was going to the drug cartel

286
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:53,838
argument is extremely powerful because

287
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,600
the fact that 60 of the drug cartels uh

288
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:57,440
in mexico's money and i know the word

289
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,800
mark cartel's being abused here but i'm

290
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,200
just going to go with the common usage

291
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:02,879
the drug cartels in mexico about 60 of

292
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,320
money from selling marijuana that if we

293
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:05,519
take the california market away from

294
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,399
them that that's going to reduce their

295
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:09,679
ability to slaughter people in mexico

296
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,039
and to do that kind of criminality

297
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:14,079
that's going on down there and people

298
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:14,079
are really concerned about that

299
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,600
the other two things that are really

300
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,959
important to california is that they

301
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,639
don't want people driving under the

302
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:23,679
influence and they don't want people in

303
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:28,319
the workplace smoking pot and so uh what

304
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:28,319
we did is in initiative it protects the

305
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:33,679
employer's right to say what people can

306
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:35,838
do on the job it protects the federal

307
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:37,199
drug-free workplace laws which by the

308
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:38,399
way we can't change federal law anyway

309
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,040
it is you know

310
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,799
and then it also uh makes sure that the

311
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:44,799
the driving under the influence laws are

312
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:46,399
intact so it protects preserves those

313
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:48,079
because again you can argue that people

314
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:49,278
may drive safer on marijuana than other

315
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,560
things but voters don't want to hear

316
00:09:49,278 --> 00:09:52,320
that they want to hear that people are

317
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:53,838
not going to be driving under the

318
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,480
influence of marijuana any more than

319
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:58,399
they used to so uh that's where the way

320
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,920
the law was written based upon polls

321
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,879
what we were looking for is the middle

322
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:02,958
ground

323
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:04,958
in other words uh and so we're getting

324
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:06,559
hit from both ends and so let's talk

325
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:08,319
about that for the next moment here

326
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:09,759
which is that uh we were got the

327
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,920
backlash we were expecting from the

328
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:14,399
right wing which is that they say well

329
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:15,679
uh this is creating a crazy situation

330
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,039
and and so forth and marijuana is this

331
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:18,239
great danger and and people begin

332
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:19,759
driving under the influence and people

333
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,959
are going to be smoking at work and we

334
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:22,639
have dealt with all that within the

335
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:24,479
initiative itself so most of their

336
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:26,078
claims don't have a lot of traction if

337
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,759
you actually read the initiative only if

338
00:10:26,078 --> 00:10:29,599
you don't read the initiative now what

339
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:31,759
we were not necessarily expecting was

340
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,680
that uh dennis perrone and another group

341
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:36,319
a woman called dragon fart or something

342
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:39,519
like that is out there uh making up

343
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,959
false stories about the initiative and

344
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,799
spreading it around we were not really

345
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:44,239
counting on that because we were hoping

346
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:46,319
for this what we call

347
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:49,519
we're doing 51.3

348
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:51,519
with the um uh what they call the um

349
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,959
likely voters but we want the unlikely

350
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,320
voters out there too the young people

351
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:55,439
who aren't expected to vote and we think

352
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,200
it's going to be important for the

353
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,120
democrats and for the progressive agenda

354
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,120
in general to have this happen as well

355
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,519
and so um

356
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,879
anyway so just to basically say it uh

357
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,159
you know there are no new felonies it

358
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:08,159
doesn't do basically anything that they

359
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:09,838
say and so in the new issue of the west

360
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:11,360
coast leaf we have a we did an

361
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:13,279
investigation of the claims that were

362
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,320
made by those people you can't go on

363
00:11:13,278 --> 00:11:15,919
forever though because they can make up

364
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,600
conspiracy stories like you wouldn't

365
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:19,039
believe and you can spend your whole

366
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,240
life trying to dispute their conspiracy

367
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:22,000
theories but we looked at the things

368
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,240
that they said were likely and we found

369
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,440
out that basically uh it was all wrong

370
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:29,278
what they had to say so then um

371
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,320
the historical context is that this has

372
00:11:29,278 --> 00:11:32,879
been

373
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,959
that this is 38 years since california

374
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:37,039
had legalizing non-medical marijuana on

375
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:39,599
the ballot coincidentally or

376
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:42,240
inextricably it's the same ballot number

377
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,440
proposition 19 and right now the big

378
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,959
funders have not come through with the

379
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,040
money for it so we need to count upon

380
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:48,479
people like john said for here you know

381
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,679
if you could take one month's supply of

382
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,039
money that you spend on marijuana and

383
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:52,799
give a third of it to normal a third of

384
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:54,719
the problem 19 a third to prop 74 that

385
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:57,719
would be an extremely good use of your

386
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,720
money

387
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:02,959
and in addition to that i would say that

388
00:12:01,278 --> 00:12:06,078
you have the uh the information here to

389
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:07,679
donate to the campaign and also the

390
00:12:06,078 --> 00:12:09,039
west coast leaf gives you a full rundown

391
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:12,078
on how these things look and all these

392
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:12,879
arguments and i think that prop 215 is

393
00:12:12,078 --> 00:12:14,799
the best thing that happened to

394
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:17,600
california

395
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:19,599
since i've been alive and if prop 19

396
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,680
passes it is going to far far surpass

397
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,800
anything that proposition 215 did and so

398
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:24,638
we need every one of you out there

399
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:26,240
telling people in california register

400
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:27,600
vote get people to vote absentee get

401
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,759
them out to vote but we have to have

402
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,519
them and we will need to win on november

403
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:33,278
the 2nd so please thank you for your

404
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:35,360
time and get everybody out

405
00:12:33,278 --> 00:12:37,600
on behalf of uh legalizing marijuana it

406
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,919
makes it lawful not just a legal defense

407
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,079
this law says it is lawful for people to

408
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:43,519
possess cultivate and use marijuana and

409
00:12:42,078 --> 00:12:44,319
that is the difference because that's

410
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,000
the beginning of the end of

411
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:50,278
discrimination which is all based upon

412
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,278
it being illegal thank you very much
