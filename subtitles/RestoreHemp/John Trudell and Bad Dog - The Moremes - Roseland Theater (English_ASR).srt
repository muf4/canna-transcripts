1
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:17,420
there's me there's the other me

2
00:00:13,609 --> 00:00:19,850
there's another me and then there are

3
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:24,410
the more means

4
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:28,609
we've all got a domino to play so we

5
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:32,149
been trying to work it out we don't know

6
00:00:28,609 --> 00:00:36,500
how your life turned or what all that

7
00:00:32,149 --> 00:00:40,759
means but me and amis we're not going

8
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:43,000
back we've already seen what we couldn't

9
00:00:40,759 --> 00:00:43,000
do

10
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:53,009
any skeletons in our closets are our own

11
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:56,310
private stash of bones that's free with

12
00:00:53,009 --> 00:00:59,729
no choice there's no scream like the

13
00:00:56,310 --> 00:01:04,530
next screen reducing the present get to

14
00:00:59,729 --> 00:01:10,978
nothing while yet eternity is now not

15
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:13,890
then who's divided into once and you

16
00:01:10,978 --> 00:01:17,539
know how many does that mean there's

17
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:20,759
love that loves there's love that fears

18
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:24,450
there's love that possesses there's love

19
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:31,159
it needs proof where's the love that

20
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:31,159
accepts love that likes love that cares

21
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:38,709
there's no forgetting some realities

22
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:41,469
destiny through it us and fate wasn't

23
00:01:38,709 --> 00:01:45,280
much help with his way of loading the

24
00:01:41,469 --> 00:01:48,478
loan but it was up to us to carry it and

25
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,478
we didn't have any sane

26
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:30,230
if the land where the law is king using

27
00:02:26,189 --> 00:02:35,039
fear like glue pretending pretending

28
00:02:30,229 --> 00:02:41,238
isn't pretending each and every one of

29
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:46,560
us have seen the Lord not a one of us

30
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:50,310
likes the way we fall sometimes straight

31
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:53,640
is a way of walking which snake isn't an

32
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:56,729
option because we've been accused of

33
00:02:53,639 --> 00:03:01,969
some things we did some things we didn't

34
00:02:56,729 --> 00:03:01,969
do and we heard I forgive you

35
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:15,409
are looking for a me there will answer

36
00:03:08,219 --> 00:03:15,409
to me so far there's no one who will

37
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:21,949
ah
