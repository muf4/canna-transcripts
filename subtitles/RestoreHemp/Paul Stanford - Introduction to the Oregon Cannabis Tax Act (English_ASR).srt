1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,759
Thank

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,359
you. You know, we helped uh oh, 110,000

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,480
people across the whole country get

4
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:11,679
medical marijuana permits. That's a good

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:14,240
thing. But one of the things we keep

6
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:16,240
hearing from the patients is why do I

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,399
have to go back in every year and get a

8
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:20,719
card? Well, that's the program we've got

9
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:23,038
right now. And it's a lot better than

10
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:25,839
being thrown in jail if you're sick of

11
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,640
marijuana. at least patients should be,

12
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:30,879
you know, out of the line of fire and

13
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:34,000
war on drugs. And so the medical

14
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:35,839
marijuana law has done that and it

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,759
continues to expand, but it's not really

16
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,480
the final solution. You know, the Oregon

17
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:42,640
Supreme Court just ruled that uh like

18
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:44,479
California that we have no appointment

19
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,239
right if you test positive for

20
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:49,959
marijuana, even if you have a permit to

21
00:00:46,238 --> 00:00:53,198
do it legally, then they can fire you at

22
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:55,759
will. We're still having

23
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:59,000
uh our kids taken away from us in court

24
00:00:55,759 --> 00:01:02,718
proceedings. We're still uh

25
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,040
facing various forms of uh prejudice

26
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:07,760
against us. And so really what we got to

27
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,439
do is end marijuana prohibition. Yeah.

28
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,320
And when we do, we're going to restore

29
00:01:09,438 --> 00:01:14,399
industrial hemp at the same time. And so

30
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:17,679
that's what our Oregon cannabis tax act

31
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:20,400
petition will do. It would allow anyone

32
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,799
to grow their own marijuana without a

33
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:26,000
license. You can even breed mar

34
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:29,439
different types of marijuana as sells

35
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,959
and starts without uh getting a license.

36
00:01:29,438 --> 00:01:34,478
You'd only need a license if you wanted

37
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:36,000
to say the flowers. You'd sell them to

38
00:01:34,478 --> 00:01:38,478
adults.

39
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,319
uh we looked at international treaties

40
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:42,078
and implemented a system of controls

41
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:43,919
that's mandated by these treaties

42
00:01:42,078 --> 00:01:45,879
because treaties carry the same weight

43
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,159
as constitution and judicial

44
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:50,478
proceedings. So we tried to design a

45
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:53,759
bill that would be upheld in court and

46
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:56,239
that's why we uh designed it the way we

47
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,159
did that had a lot to do with it because

48
00:01:56,239 --> 00:02:00,519
so often initiatives go through the

49
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:03,200
process and they're uh uh ruled

50
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:04,959
unconstitutional. So we designed this

51
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,799
specifically to be upheld in that

52
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:09,758
federal court challenge by implementing

53
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:13,040
a system of controls that these treaties

54
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:15,359
may be. But uh one of the things that

55
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:19,280
would happen with the proceeds from the

56
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,800
cannabis is 90% go to state general fund

57
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,000
which majority of that goes to

58
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:28,319
education.

59
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:30,400
Then uh 8% no 7% would go to drug

60
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:33,199
treatment programs so that people who

61
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:36,080
have problems with drugs and alcohol can

62
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:39,439
get help. Currently 95% of them are

63
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:41,680
turned away when they seek help you know

64
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:43,680
dealing with substance abuse problems.

65
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,239
1% would go for a realistic drug

66
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,800
education program for kids and then 2%

67
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:53,400
the last 2% would be directed to promote

68
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:56,719
hemp biodeiesel and hemp uh fiber and

69
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:59,519
food. Now I I truly believe the reason

70
00:02:56,719 --> 00:03:01,359
marijuana's illegal is because the

71
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:04,719
petrochemical industries came up with

72
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:08,720
the misinformation campaign that we know

73
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:11,280
as reaper. They said marijuana, this

74
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:13,680
deadly new drug, even though it was the

75
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,919
first, one of the first crops people

76
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,800
cultivated in all the first agricultural

77
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:21,000
societies on this planet. They said this

78
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:25,120
deadly new drug called marijuana based

79
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,280
on racist, you know, propaganda

80
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,080
uh was cause people go crazy and kill

81
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,479
their family and friends. Now, we know

82
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:35,000
marijuana doesn't do that. In fact, what

83
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:37,079
it does is uh the flowers of marijuana

84
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,239
produce a human

85
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:44,200
neurotransmitter that uh makes people

86
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:46,599
happy or not just one but several human

87
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:50,280
neurotransmitters. It makes people happy

88
00:03:46,598 --> 00:03:53,199
and painfree. And then they fight cancer

89
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:56,479
too. And then you move this same plant

90
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:59,598
and it makes seeds that make more oil

91
00:03:56,479 --> 00:04:03,919
and more protein per acre than any other

92
00:03:59,598 --> 00:04:05,518
plant. Over 300 gallons of oil per acre.

93
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:08,878
That's three times more than any other

94
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:12,640
biodeiesel product. And at the same

95
00:04:08,878 --> 00:04:15,039
time, uh 6,000 lb of residual protein

96
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:17,519
after a seed pressed for that oil. And

97
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:21,358
that protein is perfect. It's almost

98
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:23,840
exactly what our bodies need in terms of

99
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:26,560
uh the protein profile of all different

100
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:28,959
eight amino acids. In fact, though

101
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:32,439
soybeans make a little bit more protein,

102
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:35,918
hemp protein is much more digestible

103
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:37,160
cuz digest all the soy protein takes two

104
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:40,399
stuff. It's

105
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:42,639
like anyway, so we have a plant that

106
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:44,959
produces more fiber, more protein, and

107
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:47,840
more oil than any other plant on the

108
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:51,239
planet. This is obviously a sacred gift

109
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:56,000
from the creator, the mother

110
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:58,639
earth. Grateful that uh we're given the

111
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,240
task to free this planet, the free

112
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:04,800
industrial he and uh I think uh when we

113
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:07,918
do, we're going to open up our economy

114
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:11,918
for incredible new jobs. Once we start

115
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:14,159
using hemp oil for cars, for biofiesel,

116
00:05:11,918 --> 00:05:16,799
we won't need as much petroleum.

117
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,759
Petroleum is very toxic. You know, just

118
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:22,400
imagine if the Exxon

119
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:24,800
vales had dumped a load of hemp seed oil

120
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:26,959
in the Prince William Sound there, you

121
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,120
know, 20 some years ago. That would

122
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:31,519
have, you know, it would have been

123
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,720
nutrition for the environment, but the

124
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:38,079
petroleum wiped out the

125
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:40,320
environment. So, we need to restore him,

126
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:42,959
and that's what this petition will do.

127
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:46,319
Well, I'm really proud and and honored

128
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:50,638
that John Trudeell and his his Bad Dog

129
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:52,399
fan here, the Bad Dogs, they uh are

130
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:55,038
helping support this and get this word

131
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:56,638
out. I want to thank you all for coming.

132
00:05:55,038 --> 00:05:59,680
Please get some more petitions and

133
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:02,639
support our campaign and help us restore

134
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,639
him. Be nice.
