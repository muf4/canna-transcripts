1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,160
thanks Don

2
00:00:02,638 --> 00:00:07,519
uh so I come from a very different

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:10,000
Washington uh I call it Mordor on the

4
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:12,320
pomac um you don't smell ganja in the

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,559
air you smell sulfur right um and so

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:17,118
it's a different political reality uh

7
00:00:14,558 --> 00:00:18,879
I'm not going to talk about the the

8
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:21,079
politics of of drug policy in the west

9
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:23,479
coast much less in Seattle where you

10
00:00:21,079 --> 00:00:24,759
have a a very different world than than

11
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:27,080
exists in in much of the rest of the

12
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:28,800
country but I want to talk about how

13
00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:31,879
politics gets done in the other

14
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,520
Washington and why it is that it's so

15
00:00:31,879 --> 00:00:36,399
difficult to get any kind of meaningful

16
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:39,760
reforms going uh

17
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:42,000
initialized and uh there is a dirty

18
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:44,238
little secret in Washington uh there's

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,679
one discourse that goes on in public and

20
00:00:44,238 --> 00:00:47,759
when it comes to voting time and all

21
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:49,238
that stuff and when the doors are closed

22
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:51,000
I've been doing this for 13 years now

23
00:00:49,238 --> 00:00:53,599
talking to members of Congress and their

24
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,640
staff when they're behind closed doors

25
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,679
the whispering starts so what do you

26
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:00,159
think about Taxation and legalization

27
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:01,518
and Regulation and decriminalization

28
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:03,079
uh and I've heard this from Democrats

29
00:01:01,518 --> 00:01:05,759
and Republicans conservatives and

30
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:07,239
liberals um and they always talk about

31
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,359
it like they're the first ones who Ever

32
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:11,478
Raised that question um they're so

33
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:13,000
deeply closeted in so many ways it's

34
00:01:11,478 --> 00:01:15,280
kind of like going to a Convention of

35
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,640
closeted gay Mormons um they're all

36
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,759
terrified that everyone else in the room

37
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,560
will find out they're the same as

38
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,519
everyone

39
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:24,320
else um and so one of the things I'm I'm

40
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:26,560
trying to do is figure out how do you

41
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:28,519
depolarize what has been traditionally a

42
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:31,359
third rail or the mother of all third

43
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:32,959
rail political issues is in in politics

44
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:34,679
uh that is the drug war third rail are

45
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:36,239
people familiar with the term third rail

46
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,720
it comes from the subway system right

47
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:40,239
two rails carry the Train the third rail

48
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:42,438
carries the high voltage if you touch it

49
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:45,319
you're dead politically so historically

50
00:01:42,438 --> 00:01:48,519
third rail issues been abortion gay

51
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:52,239
marriage Aid to Israel the gun control

52
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:54,280
pedagog budget and drugs and crime um

53
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:56,919
and so what I'm trying to do is figure

54
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:58,680
out a way to depolarize that third rail

55
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:02,039
how do you get politicians to say in

56
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:03,560
public what they say in private and in

57
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:05,920
so doing I think there's a there's one

58
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:08,199
technique uh it's very counterintuitive

59
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,800
that may work um and you could try this

60
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:11,759
not just at the national level but at

61
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:14,239
the state and Municipal level with

62
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:15,439
associations conventions um you know

63
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,519
whether it's a Convention of the chiefs

64
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:19,639
of police or whatever it's a way to help

65
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:22,039
people come out of the closet slowly uh

66
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:26,119
and dip their toes in the water and that

67
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:27,239
has to do with accountability um it's

68
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,680
it's going to sound heretical but I

69
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:30,519
think there's too much accountability in

70
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,280
Washington right now

71
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:34,480
um and I think you might get more

72
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:37,239
responsive policies if you had

73
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:40,079
temporarily less accountability what do

74
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:41,878
I mean by that um Oscar wild once said

75
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,719
if you want a man to tell the truth give

76
00:02:41,878 --> 00:02:46,799
him a mask is there a way we can give

77
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:49,598
our politicians a temporary mask a

78
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:52,920
non-binding mask where they can express

79
00:02:49,598 --> 00:02:56,079
their views uh as in a confessional uh

80
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:57,559
without without risk attack risk of of

81
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,920
of being attacked

82
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:02,239
outright um the prime minister of of

83
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:05,000
Luxenberg was talking about a different

84
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:07,239
third ra issue at home um but he said

85
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,439
look we all know what needs to be done

86
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:11,039
but we just don't know how to get

87
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:13,199
reelected after we've done it this is

88
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:15,519
the problem right and the problem can be

89
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:17,679
framed I think um I think Bart Simpson

90
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,920
put it very well when Bart Simpson ran

91
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,000
for class president he ran by attacking

92
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:24,399
his opponent and he said my opponent

93
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,280
says there are no easy answers well I

94
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,719
say he's not looking hard enough that's

95
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,239
the problem in Washington people are

96
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:32,280
looking for easy answers politicians

97
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,560
think voters will only understand simple

98
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:36,438
short Solutions and if drugs are bad of

99
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,000
course you have to have a War on Drugs

100
00:03:36,438 --> 00:03:39,280
um if you're a broke you can't have

101
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,959
deficit spending you can't have a

102
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,039
stimulus package uh it's

103
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:45,438
counterintuitive to argue that that that

104
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:48,280
you do the opposite might have a better

105
00:03:45,438 --> 00:03:51,759
effect and so the way to do this then uh

106
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:54,759
is to have a nonbinding straw pole that

107
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:57,280
is to say a procedural exercise for for

108
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:59,919
10 minutes no one will know how you

109
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,598
voted your party leadership won't know

110
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:03,399
your constituents won't know your

111
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:05,199
funders won't know the lobbyists won't

112
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,799
know the nonprofits won't know no one

113
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:09,399
will know and for those 10 minutes for

114
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:11,159
the first time in Washington you will

115
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,840
have the ability as an elected official

116
00:04:11,158 --> 00:04:15,120
to think what is really in the best

117
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,959
interest of the United States of this

118
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,120
generation of the next generation of

119
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,478
Seven Generations down the line whose

120
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,240
job is to look out for the for the

121
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:26,719
bigger picture and to temporarily put

122
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:29,079
partisan concerns aside and that and

123
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,199
that would allow them then to to to come

124
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:34,560
out of the closet and express their

125
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:36,478
views anonymously and as long as one

126
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,000
person as long as one person votes in

127
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:42,079
the opposite uh way then no one can know

128
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,918
that it wasn't you uh that did that and

129
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:46,120
so it's hard to gain this in any kind of

130
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:49,000
cynical way but it's a way to get

131
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:51,120
temporary honesty and what that does is

132
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,560
that if you had a straw poll in Congress

133
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,000
that was non-binding because it has to

134
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,399
be non-binding because the

135
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,478
Constitution guarantees that if 1/5 of

136
00:04:56,399 --> 00:05:00,918
the Quorum presentent demands a recorded

137
00:04:58,478 --> 00:05:03,279
vote you have that reported vote with

138
00:05:00,918 --> 00:05:04,959
names and and who voted yes yes or no

139
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:07,319
but if you have this non-binding straw

140
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:08,839
poll and it turns out that 2/3 of

141
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:11,519
Congress or 34s of Congress thinks we

142
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:13,758
got to decriminalize or tax and regulate

143
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:16,599
um then just having that aggregate

144
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:19,120
number at the end 2/3 or 3 quarters

145
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:21,160
gives members of Congress some political

146
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:24,038
Capital they can then come out during

147
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:25,840
the recorded vote and say look um I'm

148
00:05:24,038 --> 00:05:27,439
just being courageous uh I'm I'm

149
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:29,359
actually saying in public what all of my

150
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:31,360
most of my colleagues believe in private

151
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,680
and it's time we had an open and honest

152
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,680
discussion about this it's it's it's

153
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,240
it's a if they want to present that as

154
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,400
being courageous I'll let them have it

155
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:41,000
it's a coward's way out but it's a way

156
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:43,918
for them to come out of that closet

157
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,879
slowly without risking attack uh and

158
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:48,560
that jump starts it Leap Frogs the

159
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:51,079
conversation it's a way of manufacturing

160
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:53,000
a Tipping Point right so if you imagine

161
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:55,279
if you had the National Conference of

162
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,879
the chiefs of police and you did this

163
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:58,839
Anonymous straw poll at the beginning of

164
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:00,600
their conference and it was announced

165
00:05:58,839 --> 00:06:01,959
that you know 23 third or 3/4 of the

166
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,400
police Chiefs here really believe that

167
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:05,399
we've gone too far with the drug war we

168
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:07,399
need to reverse gears uh we need to do

169
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:10,439
some some counterintuitive things and

170
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:12,038
imp Implement harming reduction Etc U

171
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:14,439
that would really change the tenor of

172
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:16,079
the conversation but right now they're

173
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:17,639
all sitting up on here on this on the

174
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:19,680
stage um

175
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:21,280
closeted and so it's a way for police

176
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,478
Chiefs for other people in sensitive

177
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:25,239
positions to come out of the closet uh

178
00:06:23,478 --> 00:06:26,839
and that can really spark a different

179
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,960
kind of conversation it could save us

180
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:30,439
years in terms of of opening up the

181
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:33,439
discussion so that's what I'm going to

182
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:33,439
do
