2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:12,320
Yeah, Hemptock. Good to be here. I

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,080
played that Seattle Hemp Fest for years

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,800
and years. Started out as a little place

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,719
up there in Starlight Mountain. Smaller

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,519
than this, even way up there in the

7
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:23,599
Cascades, you know. Be getting cold this

8
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:25,518
time of night. Be hunkering down in your

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,640
sleeping bag and your tent taking a

10
00:00:25,518 --> 00:00:31,320
little nip of something to keep warm.

11
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,359
song from back in those

12
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,039
days. Well, here's a little song that

13
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:37,200
you might get along with. All about a

14
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:39,280
natural seed growing wine by the side of

15
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,600
the roadway. It's nature's a wonderful

16
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,920
weed. Been around so long, it's hard to

17
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,600
tell why anyone would think it's new.

18
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,679
Love it or hate it. However you relate

19
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:51,000
it, I'll leave that up to you. But isn't

20
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:54,198
that righteous? And isn't that good

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,679
enough? Ain't that the way it ought to

22
00:00:54,198 --> 00:00:58,759
be? Isn't that righteous? And isn't that

23
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:03,519
good

24
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:03,519
enough? Righteous is good enough for

25
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:09,280
me. Now history's locked in a cardboard

26
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:11,359
box and it's hard to take a look with

27
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,680
sidetrack thrills and fantasies all

28
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:15,359
written all over the book. Everybody

29
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,040
tells you what to think and they've got

30
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:18,959
their reasons why. You got to pick

31
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,240
reality up by the scruff of the neck and

32
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:24,879
look it right in the eye. And isn't that

33
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:27,079
righteous? Isn't that good enough?

34
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:30,478
Ain't that the way it ought to

35
00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:31,560
be? Isn't that righteous? And isn't that

36
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:36,239
good

37
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:36,240
enough? Righteous is good enough for

38
00:01:36,519 --> 00:01:40,319
me. Now, the same people that are

39
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,159
spreading the fear, the same people that

40
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:43,919
scare me the most. You know, some of

41
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:46,240
them look like they just assume like to

42
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,000
hang it from a lamp post. They talk

43
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:50,798
about what it does to your brain. Well,

44
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,719
I just have to react cuz Hitler never

45
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:55,520
touched the stuff. And that's an actual

46
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:56,840
fact. And isn't that righteous? Isn't

47
00:01:55,519 --> 00:02:00,039
that good

48
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:03,520
enough? Ain't that the way it ought to

49
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:04,600
be? Isn't that righteous? And isn't that

50
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:09,239
good

51
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:11,919
enough? Righteous is good enough for

52
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:13,878
me. Now, George Washington was a father

53
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:16,318
of our country and he had a hemp

54
00:02:13,878 --> 00:02:18,159
plantation. Betsy Ross used it to make

55
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:20,399
the flag that flew above the baby

56
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:22,560
nation. They wrote their declarations on

57
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,840
paper from that same hemp fiber press.

58
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,680
And I don't know what they smoked when

59
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,479
they were taking a break, but I got a

60
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,120
pretty good guess. That isn't that

61
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:33,318
righteous? Isn't that good

62
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:36,800
enough? Ain't that the way it ought to

63
00:02:33,318 --> 00:02:37,878
be? Isn't that righteous? And isn't that

64
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:42,560
good

65
00:02:37,878 --> 00:02:42,560
enough? Righteous is good enough for

66
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:48,959
me. Now it'll calm you down when you're

67
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,280
too uptight. You know, it just might

68
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:53,920
make you smile. Use a seed oil in your

69
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,239
engine. little lubricate the miles.

70
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:58,318
Glaucoma and chemotherapy, they say it

71
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,560
smooths out the track. So next time you

72
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:02,439
meet a cancer patient, ask them what

73
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,080
they think about that. And isn't that

74
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:08,280
righteous? Isn't that good

75
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:11,680
enough? Ain't that the way it ought to

76
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:12,840
be? Isn't that righteous? And isn't that

77
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:18,439
good

78
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:18,439
enough? Righteous is good enough for me.

79
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:24,399
I don't know why some people get so

80
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,400
upset when you say to legalize it.

81
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,400
They'd rather build more jails, arrest

82
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,560
more people, and spread more crazy lies.

83
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,480
It's like talking to a brick wall, you

84
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,920
know? They just don't get the facts. I

85
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:35,840
think they ought to try a little that

86
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:38,559
Betsy Ross. It just might help them

87
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,039
relax. And isn't that righteous? Isn't

88
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,158
that good

89
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:46,560
enough? Ain't that the way it ought to

90
00:03:43,158 --> 00:03:48,719
be? Isn't that righteous? Isn't that

91
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,719
good enough?

92
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:52,318
Ratches is good enough for me. Now, this

93
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:54,878
is just a song about a pre for common

94
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:56,479
sense. You know what I'm saying? Just a

95
00:03:54,878 --> 00:03:58,158
little common sense, a little bit of

96
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:59,518
slowdown on a pick them up and throw

97
00:03:58,158 --> 00:04:02,560
them away and lock the door kind of

98
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,560
thing. You know what I'm talking

99
00:04:03,318 --> 00:04:08,878
about? I don't know.

100
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:11,680
I So, I I guess I've just about had my

101
00:04:08,878 --> 00:04:13,359
say now, so I get beyond my way. I know

102
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,000
some people don't like the kind of

103
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,919
things I've got to say, but I got mine

104
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,839
and you got yours. is we give what we

105
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:21,439
can take. So next time I need a

106
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:23,478
breather, well, I might just take a

107
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:26,040
little smoke break. And isn't that

108
00:04:23,478 --> 00:04:29,159
righteous? Isn't that good

109
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:32,560
enough? Ain't that the way it ought to

110
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:33,639
be? Isn't that righteous? And isn't that

111
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,560
good

112
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:39,199
enough? Righteous is good enough. Yes,

113
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:43,000
righteous is good enough. Righteous is

114
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,000
good enough for me.

115
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,478
Thank
