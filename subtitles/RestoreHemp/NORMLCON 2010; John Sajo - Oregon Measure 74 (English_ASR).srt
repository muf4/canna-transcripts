1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:05,599
i first smoked pot 45 years ago when i

2
00:00:03,678 --> 00:00:07,759
was a freshman at georgetown law school

3
00:00:05,599 --> 00:00:10,480
in washington d.c and i've been a

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:12,960
regular smoker ever since there is

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,719
nothing wrong with the responsible use

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,679
of marijuana

7
00:00:14,718 --> 00:00:19,600
it was 40 years ago next month that

8
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:21,439
normal was formed

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,199
and at the time

10
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,278
and so we've been at this now for four

11
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:27,118
decades and our position then and our

12
00:00:25,278 --> 00:00:29,518
position now is

13
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:31,439
there's absolutely nothing wrong with

14
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:33,519
the responsible use of marijuana by

15
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,439
adults and it should be of no interest

16
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,680
or concern to the government they have

17
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:41,839
no they have no business knowing whether

18
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:41,840
we smoke or why we smoke

19
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:47,439
as alan mentioned in his opening

20
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:49,920
comments we really are at a tipping

21
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:51,679
point in this country there are more

22
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,559
living americans who have smoked

23
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:55,679
marijuana than living americans who have

24
00:00:54,558 --> 00:00:58,159
not

25
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:59,840
and with the increasing support we have

26
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:02,398
from the public now

27
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:06,400
we've made more political progress in

28
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:08,960
the last five years than in the first 35

29
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,880
so folks we are very close to winning

30
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:12,478
this closer than it looks like when

31
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:14,798
you're out struggling on the street

32
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:16,959
level i understand but once change

33
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:19,680
begins it happens more quickly than you

34
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:19,679
anticipate

35
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,840
now i want to introduce you now to some

36
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,439
of the people who are

37
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,759
responsible for the progress we're

38
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:29,839
making i don't for a moment suggest that

39
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,840
these are the only important projects

40
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,280
around the country because frankly there

41
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,200
are so many of those we couldn't

42
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,719
possibly have everyone represented on a

43
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,359
panel or we wouldn't have time during

44
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:42,640
the three-day weekend but this is a fair

45
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:44,560
sample i think of the very good positive

46
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,680
progressive work that's going on on this

47
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,478
issue

48
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,479
um

49
00:01:46,478 --> 00:01:51,039
the first person i'd like to introduce

50
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:53,359
uh is because we're here in his home

51
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:56,240
state john sajo is the executive

52
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:58,078
director of a group called voter power

53
00:01:56,239 --> 00:02:00,478
they are the primary sponsor of

54
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:03,519
initiative 74 i believe it is is that

55
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:04,879
right john 74 in oregon which would

56
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:08,719
create a

57
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:10,560
state license dispensary system

58
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:12,159
where right now in oregon as healey

59
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,318
explained i'm sure

60
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:15,840
they have medical marijuana and you can

61
00:02:14,318 --> 00:02:18,318
share it among your friends and give it

62
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,560
away but nobody is legally allowed to

63
00:02:18,318 --> 00:02:22,238
sell it well with some luck in november

64
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,039
that's going to change please welcome

65
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:25,039
john sajo

66
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:32,079
thanks keith and uh welcome all you

67
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,759
normal attendees if there's any of you

68
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,840
that are my age or a little older you

69
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:36,959
might remember the last time normal had

70
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,039
the

71
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,719
annual conference in in portland was

72
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:42,719
1986

73
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:44,878
and uh back then we also had a measure

74
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:47,598
on the ballot to legalize personal use

75
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:50,239
of marijuana i was the

76
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:53,199
main person on that and uh we've come a

77
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:55,280
long way that year we got 26.3 percent

78
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:57,518
yes vote and it was a real sobering

79
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,598
lesson and so it's exciting to be with

80
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,680
you all here now when we are on the

81
00:02:59,598 --> 00:03:04,399
verge of not only being on the ballot

82
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,400
but winning the election so this is an

83
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,680
exciting time

84
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,439
i think

85
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,439
i assume you're all here because you

86
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:13,680
love marijuana and you would like to

87
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:14,878
legalize it

88
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,159
good

89
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:17,919
well let me tell you you know when i

90
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:20,399
started out as a young activist many

91
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:21,839
decades ago i looked at it and you know

92
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,760
tried to figure out well how do we do

93
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,000
that you know is it going to be do we go

94
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:28,079
to our legislatures do we go to congress

95
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,120
do we you know bring court cases where

96
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,239
the laws are thrown out and i i quickly

97
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,080
realized that the way we're going to

98
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:37,759
legalize marijuana is using the

99
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,840
initiative process and that has been how

100
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:42,239
most of the major gains have happened

101
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,840
that's how we got you know prop 215 in

102
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,959
california brought us the first medical

103
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:49,039
marijuana law now we have 14 states

104
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:52,000
plus d.c and most of them came with

105
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:54,400
initiatives so we need to embrace the

106
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,799
initiative process the people are far

107
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,319
ahead of the politicians on this issue

108
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,959
and that's how we're going to legalize

109
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:02,958
marijuana and this is an exciting year i

110
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,878
you know i'm not a hundred percent sure

111
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,479
but i think we have marijuana on the

112
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:08,318
ballot and four states and i think

113
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:10,318
that's the most we've ever had on in in

114
00:04:08,318 --> 00:04:13,318
one time so that's another measure of

115
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:13,318
progress

116
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:21,358
now i'm just going to try to share some

117
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:23,199
things i've learned over the years about

118
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:26,159
using the initiative process and what we

119
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,160
need to know about it

120
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:32,160
first off it costs a lot of money and

121
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:34,399
up until recently most of the

122
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,000
initiatives were not funded by us they

123
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:38,079
weren't funded by

124
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,918
you know a grass roots movement they

125
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:42,000
were funded by a small number of big

126
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:43,918
funders peter lewis soros and sperling

127
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,160
and thank god for those

128
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:48,560
you know really wise rich men

129
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:51,120
but it's time for this movement to move

130
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,478
past that funding source and frankly

131
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,879
we're having to do it whether we like it

132
00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:54,879
or not

133
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,360
we got on the ballot by doing it

134
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:02,478
ourselves and we did get a grant from

135
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,759
mpp and a grant from dpa but in this

136
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:05,680
initiative that we just put on the

137
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:08,400
ballot we raised the lion's share of the

138
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:11,280
money uh from small contributions and

139
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:13,519
and a few benefactors and one of my

140
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:15,519
messages is that if we want to legalize

141
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:17,839
marijuana we're going to have to pay for

142
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:19,439
it and it's not going to be cheap

143
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:22,000
and i'm hoping that we can go away from

144
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:24,079
this conference with everybody realizing

145
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,399
that we have the power just those of us

146
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:28,240
at this conference to do this but we

147
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:30,000
need to shift our spending a little bit

148
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,240
and we need to all make sure we spend as

149
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,800
much on legalization as we spend for

150
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:37,038
example at the governor hotel

151
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:40,478
and if we do that we'll be pretty close

152
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:42,319
to legalizing marijuana

153
00:05:40,478 --> 00:05:44,079
so anyway part of my pitch to you all is

154
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:45,038
we need your help you know one of the

155
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:46,639
things that's going on with this

156
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:48,719
initiative is we barely got on the

157
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:51,439
ballot we're nearly broke and we're in a

158
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,120
very very difficult tough campaign we

159
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:55,038
think we can win and there's lots of

160
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,800
evidence that shows we can but we need

161
00:05:55,038 --> 00:05:58,719
you to help us raise some money so we're

162
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,560
having an after party tonight at the

163
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,840
motish building which is about three

164
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,319
blocks from here we're passing out

165
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:06,000
flyers so so come on down and you know

166
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,000
we'll uh we'll be continuing the

167
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,560
conference after it stops here and have

168
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,959
uh speakers and and and things you can

169
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,879
uh bid on and all that all that usual

170
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:16,399
stuff but anyway we need your help so so

171
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:18,399
please step up

172
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:19,758
now what does our initiative do

173
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:21,519
our initiative you know we've had the

174
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:24,000
oregon medical marijuana act for 12

175
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:26,318
years and it's a it's a great law it it

176
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,079
has stopped patients from being arrested

177
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,639
for using their medicine

178
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:32,399
what it hasn't done is created a system

179
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,960
where all patients get medicine and they

180
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:37,439
get it conveniently we now have over

181
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:38,799
forty five thousand patients in oregon i

182
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:40,719
don't know if that's the highest per

183
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,919
capita among the states but it's right

184
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,600
up there

185
00:06:41,918 --> 00:06:45,279
but we have a system that requires these

186
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,280
people to produce their own medicine and

187
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:49,439
it's a felony for anybody to sell it to

188
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:51,519
them and we've been struggling with that

189
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:53,279
for 12 years making the best of it and

190
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:55,359
we do pretty good you know there's a lot

191
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:57,279
of organizations that that try to help

192
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,199
patients but it just doesn't work you

193
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:01,198
know there's no question

194
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:03,360
uh that requiring patients to produce

195
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,360
their own medicine keeps marijuana

196
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,439
medical marijuana in the dark ages and

197
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,280
we look forward to a future where

198
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:11,279
patients can grow it themselves if they

199
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:13,359
want but where they can go buy it and

200
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:15,439
where they can buy advanced products

201
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,199
that research and development and

202
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:18,800
innovators like some of you out there

203
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,000
are going to come up with and that's

204
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,160
going to be a better world and we're

205
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,079
going to make it happen uh on november

206
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,840
2nd

207
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:27,519
there's some really exciting aspects of

208
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:29,439
this campaign now we we've done a lot of

209
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:32,560
polling and you know one of the things i

210
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:34,319
got to say is that uh

211
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,160
part of politics is our issue but a

212
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:38,879
bigger part of politics is realizing

213
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,639
that we're a little issue in a big sea

214
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:43,439
and right now one of the things we're up

215
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:45,840
against is the decline of the democratic

216
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:48,639
party in the in the national

217
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:50,318
sphere and the you know the republicans

218
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,160
are highly motivated they're out for

219
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:53,919
blood and they're all going to be voting

220
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,560
we polled on our issue

221
00:07:53,918 --> 00:07:59,359
in right after the november 2008

222
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,038
election and we were polling at 59 32.

223
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,680
we polled in june and we're only ahead

224
00:08:01,038 --> 00:08:05,279
46 41 and it's not because people have

225
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,598
changed their attitudes about medical

226
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:09,598
marijuana it's because young democrats

227
00:08:07,598 --> 00:08:11,120
are not planning on voting

228
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:13,519
and so

229
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,598
one lesson there is the key to us

230
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:18,560
winning this election and i imagine it's

231
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:21,759
the key to prop 19 winning in california

232
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,680
is we have to mobilize the young voters

233
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,759
we have to register them and we have to

234
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,840
get out the vote so we're directing a

235
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:29,919
lot of effort in our campaign at that we

236
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:31,839
have petitioners out collecting uh

237
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:34,158
emails and registering voters we just

238
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:35,120
registered we just collected uh emails

239
00:08:34,158 --> 00:08:37,519
from

240
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,120
about 5000 people at the state fair and

241
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,639
now we have an email list approaching

242
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,719
twenty thousand and we're gonna we're

243
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:44,559
gonna keep building on that to where we

244
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,640
can send out emails and remind people to

245
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:48,799
vote in oregon we are lucky because we

246
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:50,799
have only vote by mail we don't go to

247
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:52,479
the polls at all so we have about a a

248
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:54,079
two week window where people have their

249
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,639
ballots and we're going to spend a lot

250
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,800
of our resources on on getting people

251
00:08:56,639 --> 00:09:00,879
that we know our supporters out to vote

252
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:03,199
and if we do that that will easily

253
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:05,679
overcome uh the fact that we're not over

254
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:08,640
50 in our polling numbers uh there's

255
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:09,919
been another test of of this campaign as

256
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:12,240
well

257
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:13,759
last month a new part of the initiative

258
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,399
process here in oregon was called the

259
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:18,399
citizens initiative review where

260
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:20,559
another non-profit organization

261
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,639
partnering with the state government

262
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:24,958
selected 24 voters

263
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:26,879
uh at random to demographically match

264
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:29,599
the state of oregon and those folks

265
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:32,399
studied this initiative for a solid week

266
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,800
we had many hours of uh testimony they

267
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:36,958
had expert witnesses we brought out

268
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:38,559
all kinds of people we brought

269
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:40,958
mary lynn mathery from patients out of

270
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:42,799
time and mike kravitz from uh veterans

271
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:44,958
for access to medical marijuana we

272
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:46,479
brought don duncan from asa you know the

273
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:48,719
other side they talked to andrea

274
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,480
barthwell they talked to uh

275
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,480
you know chris's police chief who said

276
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,200
all kinds of terrible things about uh

277
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:57,440
dispensaries in california uh but at the

278
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:00,080
end of that process where these 24

279
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,760
average citizens got to really get into

280
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:05,440
the trenches and study the details of

281
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:07,600
the initiative we won 13-11

282
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,920
and the lesson for that is that we can

283
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,600
win but it's going to be very close and

284
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:13,759
that's really what what we're up against

285
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,000
in this race and uh we're putting the

286
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:17,679
best campaign forward we can we got some

287
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,839
good things going for us

288
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:22,479
oregon has a voters pamphlet that you

289
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:24,240
can buy pro and con arguments in it gets

290
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,759
mailed to every household

291
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,399
we have an outstanding lineup in our

292
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:30,559
voters pamphlet uh we have 11 arguments

293
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:32,078
in including one from tom potter the

294
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:34,559
former mayor and police chief of

295
00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:36,639
portland betty roberts former justice of

296
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:38,879
the oregon supreme court

297
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:41,679
christine olson former u.s attorney for

298
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:43,519
oregon so our goal was to have some

299
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:45,359
law enforcement people on our side and i

300
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,879
think we did pretty good there uh we

301
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,519
have eight other arguments from doctors

302
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:51,679
and patients the other side has only two

303
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:54,799
uh one from citizens against legalizing

304
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:57,039
marijuana and another uh from the cops

305
00:10:54,799 --> 00:11:00,078
uh so i think we we're gonna win in that

306
00:10:57,039 --> 00:11:02,240
arena that's gonna be very influential

307
00:11:00,078 --> 00:11:04,639
we hope to raise a significant amount of

308
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,720
money over the next two months and use

309
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:09,278
it to get out the vote on the one hand

310
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,120
and also to put out our message that a

311
00:11:09,278 --> 00:11:12,799
regulated system will work better than

312
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:16,000
what we have now and we'll make sure all

313
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:18,000
patients get the medicine they need and

314
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,799
you know wish us luck do what you can to

315
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,159
help

316
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:24,359
i think we're going to win this election

317
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:24,360
in november thank you very much
