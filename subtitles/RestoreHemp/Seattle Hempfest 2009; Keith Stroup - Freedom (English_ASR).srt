1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:07,040
it is time we stop arresting marijuana

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:09,440
smokers and there's three basic reasons

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,679
one is we're spending an estimated 10

4
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:13,678
billion dollars a year

5
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:15,679
chasing and arresting and prosecuting

6
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,519
otherwise law-abiding citizens simply

7
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,679
because when they relax in the evening

8
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:21,600
they prefer to smoke a joint that's

9
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:23,278
idiotic and it's a waste of law

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,840
enforcement resources

11
00:00:23,278 --> 00:00:27,759
number two prohibition invites the

12
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:30,399
government into private areas of our

13
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,399
life that are simply inappropriate most

14
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:35,119
americans agree we don't want the

15
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:38,640
government coming into our house to know

16
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:40,799
what books we read uh the subject of our

17
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,960
of our music we listen to and certainly

18
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:45,519
we don't want them knowing and watching

19
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,600
our behavior in the bedroom well neither

20
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,760
do they have any places to get involved

21
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,640
in the decision as to whether we smoke

22
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:54,159
marijuana or drink alcohol when we relax

23
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,920
in the evening

24
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:58,398
now the good news

25
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,559
the good news is that when you ask the

26
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:03,039
public how they feel about marijuana

27
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:05,518
penalties you find that roughly 80

28
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:07,680
percent now say they support the right

29
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,478
of a serious ill patient to use medical

30
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,720
marijuana when a doctor recommends it 80

31
00:01:10,478 --> 00:01:14,400
8 out of 10 americans

32
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:16,400
well then how come we've only won that

33
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,799
in 13 states for christ's sake it's

34
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,200
because we need to take that support and

35
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:24,159
convert it into public policy

36
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,000
we know now that 76 of the public three

37
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,520
out of four americans agree with us on

38
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,599
the basic premise

39
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:33,359
that you should not arrest and jail a

40
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:35,919
marijuana smoker 76 3 out of 4. so we

41
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:38,078
have largely won the hearts and minds

42
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,320
of the american public

43
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:42,798
our challenge is to convert that into

44
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:45,199
public policy by the way more recently

45
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:47,200
there was a poll taken nationwide by

46
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:50,560
zogby the normal commission that showed

47
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:53,118
52 percent of the public nationwide now

48
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,759
favor not just decriminalizing marijuana

49
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:58,560
but legalizing it legalizing it taxing

50
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:00,799
it regulating it like we do alcohol and

51
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,439
one survey by the field poll company in

52
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:05,920
california found 56

53
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:09,439
of the people in california now support

54
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:11,360
legalization so what does this all mean

55
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:13,919
well it means honestly we're about to

56
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,040
win this issue we're getting very close

57
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:16,878
to it

58
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:19,439
i think definitely in your lifetime i

59
00:02:16,878 --> 00:02:20,959
hope in mine but within five years i

60
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:23,199
think we're going to stop arresting

61
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,959
marijuana smokers in this country and

62
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:27,679
the first few states are going to begin

63
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,360
to experiment with legally regulated

64
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,680
markets

65
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,599
justice anthony kennedy in writing for

66
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,560
the majority in the u.s supreme court

67
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:38,639
recently in a case

68
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,759
said the following at the heart of

69
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:42,159
liberty

70
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:44,878
is the right to define one's own concept

71
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:47,359
of existence of meaning of the universe

72
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:49,120
and of the mystery of the human life it

73
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,800
is the promise of the constitution that

74
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,439
there is a realm of personal liberty

75
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,519
where the government may not enter

76
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:57,199
well as i said when i started there's

77
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:00,080
absolutely nothing wrong with the

78
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:02,079
responsible use of marijuana by adults

79
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,440
and it is of no interest to the

80
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,239
government and they should stop

81
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:07,919
arresting and start respecting marijuana

82
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,000
smokers

83
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:12,479
in the end we are only accidentally

84
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,039
talking about marijuana we are really

85
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:19,039
talking about personal freedom

86
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:21,439
join normal stand-up legalize marijuana

87
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:21,439
thank you

88
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:26,719
right on keith
