Keith St Welcome to our show now you

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,000
started normal is the impression I got

10
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:23,239
you're the founder of normal how did

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,439
that all get started how'd that come

12
00:00:23,239 --> 00:00:29,399
about well I was uh coming out of law

13
00:00:26,439 --> 00:00:30,759
school and it was I graduated in 1968

14
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:33,079
and if you remember those were the

15
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:34,878
height of the anti-war years so like a

16
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:36,520
lot of law students I'd first been

17
00:00:34,878 --> 00:00:38,479
introduced to marijuana as part of the

18
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:40,520
anti-war movement it was back then if

19
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:42,038
you smoked a marijuana cigarette you

20
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:44,640
were making as much a political

21
00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:46,520
statement as you were having enjoying a

22
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,399
recreational drug you were essentially

23
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:50,800
thumbing your nose at The Establishment

24
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:53,640
that had gotten us into the Quagmire of

25
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:56,238
Vietnam um but what began to be to

26
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:59,239
happen where um a lot of friends began

27
00:00:56,238 --> 00:01:00,959
to be busted and literally the uh the

28
00:00:59,238 --> 00:01:02,558
first few months I was out of law school

29
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,118
I had two or three friends come to me

30
00:01:02,558 --> 00:01:06,280
who had been stopped because they either

31
00:01:04,118 --> 00:01:07,759
had long hair and got the attention of

32
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:09,239
the police or drove a van or there were

33
00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:10,959
all kind peace signs were on their bump

34
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:12,759
or whatever and when they'd pull them

35
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:15,478
over of course they'd find a joint under

36
00:01:12,759 --> 00:01:17,759
the seat or whatever and as a young

37
00:01:15,478 --> 00:01:20,679
lawyer trying to figure out how to help

38
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:23,118
these folks um I had also just spent two

39
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:25,118
years working on a a group called The

40
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:26,799
National Commission on product safety it

41
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:28,640
was my way to stay out of Vietnam to be

42
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,560
real honest I was I managed to get a

43
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,040
critical skills toir it and and to avoid

44
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,280
having to go to the war and I was about

45
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,360
10 days away from having to ship out

46
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:39,280
when I got that so I spent 2 years

47
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:42,200
working closely with Ralph nater and I

48
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,439
was impressed by uh the techniques he

49
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:47,320
used and it seemed to us that instead of

50
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:48,478
trying to deal with individuals one by

51
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:50,078
one who were being arrested for

52
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:52,039
marijuana and at that point by the way

53
00:01:50,078 --> 00:01:55,000
the arrest rates were about I think

54
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:56,479
about 650,000 people a year and over 90%

55
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,319
of those were for simple possession of

56
00:01:56,478 --> 00:02:00,200
an ounce or less and they were going to

57
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:01,559
jail for long periods of time especially

58
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:04,039
in States like Texas but actually all

59
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,118
over the country they were okay so we

60
00:02:04,039 --> 00:02:07,478
thought if we could start an

61
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:09,280
organization that uh approached the

62
00:02:07,478 --> 00:02:11,000
problem the way nater did on a lot of

63
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,719
his issues as with a consumer

64
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,759
perspective and to focus on the

65
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:16,080
unfairness of treating otherwise

66
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:17,840
law-abiding citizens who weren't

67
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,480
threatening in any way at all as

68
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,878
criminals simply because they prefer to

69
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:23,359
smoke a marijuana cigarette rather than

70
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:25,159
drink alcohol that there was a good good

71
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,080
bit of appeal to that if you made that

72
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:30,878
case effectively so normal really was a

73
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,160
concept that we sat down thought up and

74
00:02:30,878 --> 00:02:35,359
uh and put together and then you took

75
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:37,919
that concept and you made that grow

76
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,200
Nationwide well uh there has certainly

77
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:41,518
had been people with similar ideas

78
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:42,839
before there had been small groups

79
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,360
spraying up in different parts of the

80
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,239
country I had trouble getting good

81
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:48,280
funding it was obviously not a very

82
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:52,599
popular issue back then that I'm talking

83
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:54,080
now 68 69 and 70 um you were perceived

84
00:02:52,598 --> 00:02:57,598
as being radical and certainly out of

85
00:02:54,080 --> 00:03:00,360
the mainstream um I managed to get some

86
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:02,598
pretty good funding I managed to uh to

87
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:05,920
get Playboy Foundation behind the

88
00:03:02,598 --> 00:03:07,598
project early on um Hefner would give us

89
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:09,039
space in the magazine to focus on

90
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:10,560
victims where if we were able to go in

91
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:13,199
and get someone out of jail or whatever

92
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,598
so uh over a period of a couple of years

93
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:16,359
we did a lot of traveling we'd go to

94
00:03:14,598 --> 00:03:18,039
Texas where the situation was probably

95
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,560
the worst and we'd take journalists

96
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:21,039
through the Texas prison system for

97
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,519
example because we wanted them to meet

98
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:24,199
these people who are being locked up and

99
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:27,120
to see what who these victims really

100
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:29,399
were um and in the process of that the

101
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,000
name normal obviously got some currency

102
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,879
and it began to be recognized by at

103
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,438
least a minority of the folks in the

104
00:03:33,878 --> 00:03:39,438
country as the public interest group

105
00:03:35,438 --> 00:03:41,479
working on marijuana um the major uh

106
00:03:39,438 --> 00:03:44,479
step forward in solidifying the country

107
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:46,039
under one Banner had to do with amorphia

108
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:49,039
on the west coast it's a fascinating

109
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:51,199
group that Gordon Brownell and um uh

110
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:53,438
Michael Aldridge and uh there was a

111
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:55,119
third person had put together and it was

112
00:03:53,438 --> 00:03:56,919
a legalization group and they raised

113
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,200
their funds by selling rolling papers

114
00:03:56,919 --> 00:04:01,919
made from Cannabis and if you keep in

115
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:03,518
mind cannabis is what it's used in

116
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:05,280
Canadian currency it's used in a lot of

117
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,719
things but it was nonetheless it was a

118
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,199
it was an interesting idea because you

119
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:10,680
could in theory raise your money from

120
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:14,598
your own constituents to fund the

121
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:16,358
project the problem was back then it was

122
00:04:14,598 --> 00:04:18,798
similar to I think the political

123
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:21,399
situation today if you were perceived as

124
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:24,039
being proot of trying to turn on the

125
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:25,560
world you really couldn't get access to

126
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:27,840
legislator and you wouldn't get access

127
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:29,360
to the major media so we always said we

128
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:31,038
didn't encourage the use of marijuana

129
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,400
but we recognize that for millions of

130
00:04:31,038 --> 00:04:33,839
people who made the choice to use it

131
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:37,079
that's their choice it's part of the

132
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:39,439
right to privacy so um amoria had

133
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:40,800
trouble continuing making their Project

134
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:43,160
work because they were perceived as a

135
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,439
little bit over the line so we got to

136
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:46,039
know them they were doing very good work

137
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:47,680
on the west coast and we were doing good

138
00:04:46,038 --> 00:04:50,680
work in most of the rest of the country

139
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,240
so we merged amorphia with normal um we

140
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,759
opened up a West Coast office one of

141
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,560
their people ran it one of their people

142
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:58,639
came back and helped me run the East

143
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:01,240
Coast office and so from about 1973 on I

144
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:03,360
think most of the ious work on marijuana

145
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:06,918
law reform was done under the banner of

146
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:09,280
normal now when I was uh first hearing

147
00:05:06,918 --> 00:05:11,159
about normal back in the 70s I'm from

148
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:13,478
Indiana and travel news travel is a

149
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:16,639
little slower usually two or three I'm

150
00:05:13,478 --> 00:05:18,159
from Southern Illinois so I know okay we

151
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:20,079
were always under the impression that if

152
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,000
you got busted for anything whether it

153
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:23,560
was a joint a bag no matter where you

154
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,079
were at in the United States if you got

155
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:28,439
into a spot call normal they're there at

156
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:30,519
your side and they'll fight for you well

157
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:32,240
and I think we pretty well did that now

158
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:34,159
I'm sure there were cases where the help

159
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,199
we offered them may may not have been as

160
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,479
comprehensive as one would like to offer

161
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:41,639
but we had a lot of calls but we also

162
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:43,758
had a a lot of young lawyers like myself

163
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:46,680
but spread all over the country who were

164
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:48,639
getting out of law school about 67 6869

165
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:51,720
they'd been radicalized by the anti-war

166
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:55,160
movement um they began to get active in

167
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:57,039
other social issues so it was feasible

168
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,520
back then that when those phone calls

169
00:05:57,038 --> 00:06:00,318
came into my office in Washington I

170
00:05:58,519 --> 00:06:03,478
could pick up the phone and I had lists

171
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:06,000
of half a dozen or more dedicated active

172
00:06:03,478 --> 00:06:08,800
lawyers in almost every state okay that

173
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,360
would at no cost uh drive across the

174
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,639
state or whatever uh get a bail hearing

175
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,240
get this poor kid out of jail uh figure

176
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:17,598
out if he could negotiate something or

177
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:19,759
if not represent him uh and most of

178
00:06:17,598 --> 00:06:21,719
those times for no fee at all okay uh

179
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:23,240
they were really dedicated lawyers so I

180
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,919
think that was an accurate perception of

181
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:28,079
a lot of our activity in the 70s but

182
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:30,120
again keep in mind that we were we had

183
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:32,879
to help people because that's what the

184
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:34,759
guts of the issue was about and we also

185
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:36,800
had to make sure the rest of America who

186
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:38,400
didn't smoke marijuana got to know some

187
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,160
of these people and the way we did it

188
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:41,959
was we would go help them and then we

189
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,680
would with their permission publicize

190
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:45,758
the case both in the local media and

191
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,959
sometimes in the National media when did

192
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,560
that start to change I know that people

193
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:52,359
now sometimes when they ring up normal

194
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:54,319
they have difficulties in reaching

195
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:56,000
assistance I'm I'm not sure I can

196
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:58,479
exactly follow it I can tell you I was

197
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
with normal from when we started at 1970

198
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:04,000
and I left in um mid 1979 so I ran it

199
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,160
for about the first 10 years um their

200
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,918
political side I think atrophy during

201
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,360
the 8S uh they still have an active

202
00:07:08,918 --> 00:07:12,680
legal committee but it's a legal

203
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:14,199
committee that uh mainly holds clle

204
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:16,038
programs in other words they train other

205
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:17,360
lawyers and they do some very good work

206
00:07:16,038 --> 00:07:19,079
and they have some of the finest lawyers

207
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,960
in the country that still are active on

208
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:23,359
that side but when the political climate

209
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:24,918
of the country began to get more

210
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,639
conservative I would say the parents

211
00:07:24,918 --> 00:07:30,478
group started making a big impact uh

212
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:31,840
anti- drug impact in the the late 70s

213
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:32,639
and then they really took hold in the

214
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:35,638
early

215
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:37,199
80s normal got positioned somehow to

216
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:40,199
where they were no longer allowed to

217
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:42,439
play uh if you had a legislative hearing

218
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:43,960
uh in Congress or in one of the States

219
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:46,158
during the 70s they wouldn't have

220
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:47,719
thought about having a hearing without

221
00:07:46,158 --> 00:07:49,839
inviting us to have at least one

222
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:52,280
spokesperson and in fact the majority of

223
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:54,038
the hearings that were held we put on we

224
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:57,119
had a traveling Road show of

225
00:07:54,038 --> 00:07:59,680
psychiatrists and pediatricians and

226
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,199
researchers uh Dr Whipple a wonderful

227
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:04,639
pediatrician in her 80s zinberg and wild

228
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:06,400
at Harvard uner ligher at UCLA we had

229
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:08,478
some World recognized

230
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:10,359
psychopharmacologists and others who

231
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:12,038
were willing and we would raise the

232
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,759
money to do this but we would line up

233
00:08:12,038 --> 00:08:15,839
three or four states and set up State

234
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,400
Legislative hearings and take these

235
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:20,239
people state to state so they could hear

236
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:23,000
from the real experts excellent um

237
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:25,000
sometime in the early 80s they quit

238
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,399
allowing normal to participate and we

239
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,959
were defined once again or the

240
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:30,839
organization was as being too radical

241
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:32,439
but I don't I think normal had changed I

242
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:35,838
think the country had changed it had

243
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:38,800
gone this direction to the okay now I

244
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:40,519
know that uh our laws uh have gotten a

245
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:43,679
little different over the past several

246
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:45,240
years and uh we hope to cover uh some of

247
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:47,159
these aspects in your opinions if

248
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:49,120
they've gotten worse or better when we

249
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:51,519
come back after

250
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:54,519
this welcome back to our discussion with

251
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:57,120
Keith stro Keith uh do you think that

252
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:59,240
the laws have gotten worse or better I

253
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,440
mean in some ways they've gotten we know

254
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:03,919
what that we got the medical taken care

255
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,120
of now maybe in San Francisco yeah and

256
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:07,278
so that is positive but on the overall

257
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:10,399
do you think they've gotten worse or

258
00:09:07,278 --> 00:09:12,439
better well um it shows one's age to be

259
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,879
able to put it in perspective but I will

260
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:16,320
tell you that um if you've been at this

261
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:18,039
for a while or if someone's been

262
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:21,680
focusing and interested in the drug

263
00:09:18,039 --> 00:09:25,240
issue for some time in the late 60s um

264
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:26,958
it was uh the first war on drugs was uh

265
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:30,240
announced by the president and they

266
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:34,319
passed a major anti-me bill I believe it

267
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:36,399
was in uh 69 that in fact included a

268
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,160
provision introduced by then Congressman

269
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,440
Ed cotch who of course subsequently was

270
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:41,838
a mayor of New York for many years uh to

271
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,480
require him to set up something called

272
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:45,560
the commission on marijuana and drug

273
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:48,399
abuse and it sort of went unnoticed by

274
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:49,679
the the U DEA and the government

275
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,759
agencies that thought they were getting

276
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:53,759
through you know this first anti-drug

277
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:55,159
bill now I'll connect back up with that

278
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:57,078
in a second but in answer to your

279
00:09:55,159 --> 00:10:00,039
question the laws at that time were very

280
00:09:57,078 --> 00:10:03,278
tough indeed um for example in 1970 and

281
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:04,519
71 in the state of Texas they had over

282
00:10:03,278 --> 00:10:06,000
I'm trying it's been a while since I've

283
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:08,480
thought about these figures but they had

284
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,480
over a hundred people locked up for life

285
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,680
sentences for possession of an ounce or

286
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:15,039
less of marijuana life sent for life

287
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:17,838
sentences they had something like 600

288
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:19,919
people serving more than 30-year terms

289
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:22,240
so there were pockets of the country

290
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:24,679
where the laws were as outrageous then

291
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:27,039
as as they are in the worst place today

292
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:29,078
I think the major change has been that

293
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:31,039
people are more aware of the tough laws

294
00:10:29,078 --> 00:10:33,199
now because they tend to be federalized

295
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:34,399
uh Congress every year tries to outdo

296
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,560
what they did the year before and they

297
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:38,679
pass more minimum mandatories and they

298
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:41,039
pass more death penalty categories where

299
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:43,000
people can be put to death um it has no

300
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:45,360
impact of course on crime it has no

301
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,639
impact on drug use but it somehow it's a

302
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,200
demagogy experience that politicians

303
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:52,799
find works for them so they keep doing

304
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:54,440
it um so things are I would say about as

305
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:57,519
bad now as they've ever been because

306
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:59,279
you've now had all of the Reagan Era and

307
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:01,320
uh two years of the Bush era where they

308
00:10:59,278 --> 00:11:02,759
trying to outdo themsel and show how

309
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,519
against drugs they are by locking up

310
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:06,799
more and more people but I will say this

311
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:08,759
I don't think it's any worse today um

312
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:10,199
than it was in the late 60s early '70s

313
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:12,360
and in particular I don't think the

314
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,879
climate overall is any worse you got to

315
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:16,759
remember we were coming out of the uh

316
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:18,838
Reaper Madness era and we hadn't moved

317
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:20,159
very far beyond that by the late 60s

318
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:21,880
there were still people that thought if

319
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:23,759
you smoke marijuana it was addictive or

320
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:25,958
it made you commit violent crimes I mean

321
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:27,559
things that now seem kind of oh well

322
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:29,278
like children might talk about but

323
00:11:27,559 --> 00:11:30,919
nobody in the who's educated would

324
00:11:29,278 --> 00:11:32,600
discuss those things they were they were

325
00:11:30,919 --> 00:11:35,919
perceived as being accurate in the late

326
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:38,480
60s so um what I see is a cyclical

327
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:40,039
movement where interestingly there was a

328
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,800
book by David mustow a professor of

329
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:43,879
history at Yale University that he used

330
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:45,439
to do some testifying for us that he

331
00:11:43,879 --> 00:11:48,120
talks about the history of Narcotics

332
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:50,839
legislation generally and it tends to go

333
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:52,959
in say decade long jumps where you'll go

334
00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:55,279
for a decade and the country will be

335
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:57,599
somewhat permissive especially if the

336
00:11:55,278 --> 00:11:58,879
econom is doing well we tend to be a

337
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,320
little bit more willing to let our

338
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:02,000
neighbors do what they want as long as

339
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,160
they don't bother us and so you you get

340
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,919
in the period where as we were in the

341
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:08,159
early' 70s up through the really the

342
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:10,278
late '70s where the country essentially

343
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:12,480
said we don't really care if you smoke

344
00:12:10,278 --> 00:12:14,439
marijuana don't flaunt it in our face

345
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:17,278
but we shouldn't lock up lock you people

346
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:19,240
up in jail with real criminals but at

347
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:20,720
some point then the pendulum starts SW

348
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:23,120
swinging back and clearly for the last

349
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,680
12 13 years it has been going in a more

350
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,799
conservative Direction but that too will

351
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:30,239
change and I I suppose what I want

352
00:12:27,799 --> 00:12:33,319
people to understand is it is often

353
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,919
during the times of the the worst

354
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:37,639
repression or

355
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:39,399
oppression that political activist and

356
00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:41,959
public interest associations do their

357
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:43,839
most creative and most valuable work our

358
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:46,479
best work at normal I honestly believe

359
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:47,920
was during the early and mid 700s when

360
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,639
uh it was tough out there and there was

361
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:51,278
a threat of being arrested at every stop

362
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:53,440
and the police were they didn't even

363
00:12:51,278 --> 00:12:55,240
want us coming into town when we started

364
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,639
making progress and started being more

365
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:58,799
acceptable and then when Jimmy Carter

366
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,680
became president Etc it was difficult to

367
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:02,838
know what to do we weren't used to being

368
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:05,719
insiders so I would suspect what you're

369
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:08,199
going to see is um as bad as things are

370
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:10,079
today 3 or 4 years from now I think we

371
00:13:08,198 --> 00:13:12,799
will look back and feel very good about

372
00:13:10,078 --> 00:13:14,359
the progress and unexpected progress in

373
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:15,759
a lot of cases that are going to be made

374
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,800
in the next few years I don't think it's

375
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:19,958
a hopeless situation God I hope so there

376
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:22,919
are so many people out there now oh yeah

377
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:24,479
I knows um now you commented earlier in

378
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:26,519
our discussion that you worked in

379
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,720
association with Ralph nater now that

380
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:29,560
must have been interesting and

381
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:31,879
beneficial to what you were doing normal

382
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:34,078
well I think he's uh the ultimate public

383
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:36,320
interest lawyer and probably the role

384
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:39,359
model for hundreds and hundreds of

385
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:41,120
people who came along after him um I was

386
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,240
lucky in that when I was hired at this

387
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,720
Commission on product safety they hired

388
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:48,278
four young lawyers right out of law

389
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:50,040
school and um our immediate boss was a a

390
00:13:48,278 --> 00:13:51,799
lawyer from Harvard who had been Ralph

391
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:53,838
nater's roommate in law school and when

392
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:55,838
nater first came and set up his first

393
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:57,959
public interest group in Washington uh

394
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,800
this man had been his executive director

395
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:01,799
so it gave me a chance to study at the

396
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:04,240
feed of people who I consider to be the

397
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:06,879
Masters I think they probably defined

398
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:09,799
the whole field of public interest law

399
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:13,600
okay now do you see the hemp movement

400
00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:16,719
taking a a major effect into the economy

401
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:19,399
soon and if so on a national scale or is

402
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:22,079
it a global outside of America or well

403
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:24,078
I've been fascinated by the U attention

404
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:25,758
paid in the last year to finally to

405
00:14:24,078 --> 00:14:28,039
arguments that had sometimes been made

406
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:30,839
earlier but apparently didn't catch

407
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:33,599
didn't catch on for some reason um what

408
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:35,680
I saw is during the 70s we focused on

409
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,800
getting kids out of jail or people out

410
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:40,078
of jail for smoking grass that seemed to

411
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:41,758
be the area that needed the attention

412
00:14:40,078 --> 00:14:44,039
and also the area that people were

413
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:45,800
willing to reconsider maybe they are

414
00:14:44,039 --> 00:14:48,039
overreacting to this whole question of

415
00:14:45,799 --> 00:14:49,919
whether somebody smokes a joint the

416
00:14:48,039 --> 00:14:52,078
medical issue began to come along in the

417
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:54,240
mid-70s when I remember when Bob Randle

418
00:14:52,078 --> 00:14:56,159
first walked in my office and said I'm a

419
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,680
glaucoma patient when I smoke marijuana

420
00:14:56,159 --> 00:15:00,360
my vision clears up I I thought this is

421
00:14:58,679 --> 00:15:02,120
wonderful news I also wondered if I was

422
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:04,079
dealing with u somebody who was a little

423
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:05,879
flaky now over the years obviously I got

424
00:15:04,078 --> 00:15:07,278
to know Bob I greatly respect him and

425
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:09,320
he's led the charge on this whole

426
00:15:07,278 --> 00:15:12,480
question of the medicinal uses of

427
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:15,600
marijuana um but for a number of years I

428
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:18,320
think that issue has carried its burden

429
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,800
um there's been probably more progress

430
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,839
made in that part of the the drug issue

431
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:25,838
in the last 10 years than in any other

432
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:28,440
now what I see is I see this economy or

433
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:31,000
ecology and economy movement uh

434
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:33,800
beginning to discuss seriously what hemp

435
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,159
could do for for our economy and um uh

436
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:38,879
how it could help us avoid polluting our

437
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:40,879
ecology um all of that is both good in

438
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:43,318
the sense that I think it has Merit in

439
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:45,198
its own right it's also good because it

440
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:47,039
makes it more difficult for those who

441
00:15:45,198 --> 00:15:49,679
want to continue to treat us as

442
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:52,480
criminals to justify marijuana as some

443
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:54,439
evil drug um so I'm delighted at the

444
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,839
movement I suspect that it has a lot of

445
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:57,480
uh there'll be a lot of progress in that

446
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:59,000
area too okay now currently you're

447
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:01,600
working for the nation National

448
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,278
Association for criminal defense lawyers

449
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,440
um could you tell us a little bit what

450
00:16:03,278 --> 00:16:07,600
that's about and still allow you to keep

451
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,880
your hand active in the hint movement

452
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,600
well I haven't uh really for the last 10

453
00:16:09,879 --> 00:16:13,318
12 years I haven't been active in it I

454
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,959
still know some of the people and

455
00:16:13,318 --> 00:16:17,078
occasionally I'll drop by a meeting or

456
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:19,599
something I certainly feel a sense of

457
00:16:17,078 --> 00:16:21,120
history and connection to it but the

458
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,920
hemp movement I think is kind of a

459
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,278
younger person's game not entirely but I

460
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:28,479
mean I think it's important for all

461
00:16:25,278 --> 00:16:31,000
issues that every few years you have a

462
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:33,440
new young group of idealistic and

463
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,039
committed and energized people who care

464
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,279
very much about the issue that you kind

465
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:38,439
of pass the Baton to sometimes they take

466
00:16:37,278 --> 00:16:40,958
it I mean they're just good enough they

467
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:42,399
start doing good work and and uh you

468
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:45,638
start realizing you want to help them

469
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:48,000
with their projects um now what I do now

470
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:50,759
is not not terribly different but it's

471
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,399
not quite as focused um I represent a

472
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:54,680
Cadre of lawyers who are terribly

473
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:56,679
committed to the Bill of Rights the very

474
00:16:54,679 --> 00:16:59,318
concerned that the War on Drugs has in

475
00:16:56,679 --> 00:17:00,799
fact become a war on the Constitution

476
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:03,399
and that what the Supreme Court has done

477
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:05,558
in essence is they've created a created

478
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:08,199
a an exception to the Fourth Amendment

479
00:17:05,558 --> 00:17:10,678
that's a drug exception if if drugs are

480
00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:12,880
involved in a fact situation they will

481
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:14,880
Overlook police conduct or Overlook the

482
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:17,319
absence of a warrant and justify it on

483
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,400
the basis of its drugs but if it's in an

484
00:17:17,318 --> 00:17:21,480
area without drugs absolutely they throw

485
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,199
the evidence out well there's no drug

486
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:24,838
exception in the Constitution that's

487
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:27,640
been created they don't call it that but

488
00:17:24,838 --> 00:17:29,319
that's what they've done okay so uh I do

489
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:31,440
much the same kind of work but it's a

490
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:33,519
it's a little broad more broad-based we

491
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,600
oppose the death penalty we we train

492
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:37,918
criminal defense lawyers so that they

493
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:40,000
can do a better job at assuring that a

494
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:42,280
citizen who is arrested has a fair

495
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,798
chance to tell his side of the story and

496
00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:45,678
that unless the government meets their

497
00:17:43,798 --> 00:17:48,720
burden that individual ought not to be

498
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:50,160
in jail um I it's important work it's

499
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,440
not terribly different from what I did

500
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:55,519
at normal okay we have about a minute

501
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:57,400
left uh our audience I'm sure is very

502
00:17:55,519 --> 00:17:59,798
interested in your background and your

503
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:02,440
knowledge and your perception of your

504
00:17:59,798 --> 00:18:04,440
avenues that you've walked down in life

505
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:07,558
uh is there anything that you'd like to

506
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:09,960
share that would be well I'll tell you

507
00:18:07,558 --> 00:18:11,798
there was once when I was young um I'm

508
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:14,440
47 so when I was younger I guess I'm not

509
00:18:11,798 --> 00:18:15,960
quite dead yet but uh I I went to Ramsey

510
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:17,600
Clark when I was first thinking about

511
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:19,440
starting normal because he was a hero of

512
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:23,079
mine from his anti-war work

513
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:24,759
etc and um I was I wanted to do it I had

514
00:18:23,079 --> 00:18:27,000
it formulated but it was a little scary

515
00:18:24,759 --> 00:18:29,279
to quit my job and jump off the deep end

516
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,640
Ramsey said to me I'd read his book

517
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:32,279
I'm sorry I read his book crime in

518
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:35,440
America and he talked about the need to

519
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:36,960
legalize drugs he said Keith do it and I

520
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,679
said well I want to but I need

521
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,200
encouragement from people like you who I

522
00:18:38,679 --> 00:18:42,798
you know I respect and you're wiser it

523
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:44,480
seems kind of suicidal and he said do it

524
00:18:42,798 --> 00:18:46,440
when you're young when you can be

525
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,159
idealistic and make those kinds of risks

526
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:50,080
take those kinds of chances when you're

527
00:18:48,159 --> 00:18:51,440
older and you have kids in college you

528
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:54,158
have other considerations you have to

529
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:56,759
make so um I would say the same thing to

530
00:18:54,159 --> 00:18:58,880
younger folks if you've got a a sense of

531
00:18:56,759 --> 00:19:01,319
commitment and you feel that something

532
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:04,200
you care about is important enough

533
00:19:01,319 --> 00:19:05,678
follow that it really is important um I

534
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:08,279
have never had a moment of regret for

535
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:09,840
the 10 years I spent running normal

536
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:11,480
