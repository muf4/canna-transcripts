1
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:07,040
feeling

2
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:08,400
the feeling

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,800
of something

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,960
gone wrong

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:16,759
how do you define

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,759
what you can't explain

7
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:21,439
and they're dragging on

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,920
hunger

9
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:26,480
goes on long

10
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,519
and in self-defense

11
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,278
long

12
00:00:27,518 --> 00:00:32,879
keeps gnawing back

13
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:34,238
sometimes

14
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,719
the thoughts

15
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:39,280
don't know what to think

16
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,039
and where i've been

17
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,719
doesn't remember

18
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:45,839
a thing

19
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,840
about me

20
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:50,479
something strange going on

21
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,640
everything that had unraveled

22
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:58,640
and now

23
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,960
it's raveling back

24
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,840
into all i thought

25
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,840
i'd escaped

26
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:14,079
those places i don't want to go

27
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:16,560
but don't want could care less

28
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:21,200
about any of that

29
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:24,640
not with his own need for a fix

30
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:27,600
looking at what's been done

31
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,118
all i did was go along for the ride

32
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:32,000
i didn't ask

33
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:32,000
where we were going

34
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,200
in a shadowing of light

35
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:38,840
flung to the edge

36
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,840
collided with

37
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:45,560
reality and reality

38
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,560
didn't even blink

39
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:08,000
those dreams

40
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:11,680
marked by scars

41
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:15,120
the rampaging question is who

42
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,120
would want to score a dream

43
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,560
maybe

44
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:22,000
its scars

45
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:25,598
need dreams too

46
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:29,280
writing a shattering of breaking

47
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:31,679
into an echo of silence

48
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,280
that bitter taste

49
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:37,480
looks

50
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,479
for someone sweet

51
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,400
feeling

52
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:05,840
the feeling

53
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,840
of something gone wrong

54
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,680
how do you define

55
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:11,679
what you can't explain

56
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:19,119
writing a shadowing of light

57
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:22,000
flung to the edge

58
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:24,080
collided with reality

59
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,878
and reality

60
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,879
didn't even blink

61
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,640
you
