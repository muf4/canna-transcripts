1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,278
i'm pleased to watch the evolution here

2
00:00:03,279 --> 00:00:07,839
for example of this gathering

3
00:00:05,278 --> 00:00:11,280
you're getting down into the nuts and

4
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:15,519
bolts new faces some old friends

5
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:18,879
hearing the report from the regulators

6
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:22,240
what steve said 210 million dollars in

7
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:24,320
little oregon already

8
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:25,198
things are happening

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,800
although

10
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,840
it's ironic

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,400
that

12
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:32,159
donald trump's point person

13
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:35,679
on the drug war

14
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:37,039
chose the week that california opened up

15
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:40,320
the largest

16
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:43,039
marijuana market in america

17
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,719
and the week that vermont became the

18
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:47,039
first state

19
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:49,840
through the legislative process

20
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,840
to legalize

21
00:00:49,929 --> 00:00:53,158
[Applause]

22
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:00,878
to try and upset the apple part

23
00:00:57,198 --> 00:01:03,519
to attack state legal industry

24
00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:04,478
to be able to cast a shadow

25
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:08,320
over

26
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:12,640
progress that is taking place now in 30

27
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:15,359
states around the country um

28
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:18,478
i have been doing this a long time i am

29
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:20,959
excited about what you've done what's

30
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:23,280
happened with the public

31
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:24,319
i mean when we first started this

32
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,439
it was

33
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:29,118
one out of three maybe in the polls that

34
00:01:27,438 --> 00:01:30,879
thought that we ought to

35
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:32,239
legalize

36
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:35,920
cannabis

37
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:38,319
we've watched that move forward

38
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:41,200
the last polls i've seen actually a

39
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:43,118
majority of republicans

40
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,560
now support

41
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:46,640
adult use

42
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,920
and if you look at independents and

43
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,079
democrats

44
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:53,519
the numbers are off the charts

45
00:01:50,078 --> 00:01:54,478
one thing that has remained consistent

46
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:58,000
is that

47
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:59,920
regardless of how americans feel

48
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,159
about marijuana

49
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,759
they don't think the federal government

50
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:09,799
should interfere

51
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:09,799
with what states decide they want to do

52
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,760
that is

53
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:19,840
our secret weapon

54
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:21,439
one of our secret weapons you know i've

55
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,878
been going around the country and i've

56
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:23,840
been campaigning on these ballot

57
00:02:22,878 --> 00:02:26,959
measures

58
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,959
um very exciting watch what's happened

59
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,640
and then the results actually i would

60
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:32,400
have spent more time in arizona if i'd

61
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:34,958
known we were going to get that close we

62
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,039
would have been maybe nine for nine

63
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:39,759
but eight out of nine is not bad

64
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:42,239
and as i remind every audience every

65
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:44,719
interview i give

66
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:47,360
in the states where donald trump

67
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:49,039
and cannabis were on the ballot

68
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,540
cannabis got a lot more votes than

69
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:54,750
donald trump

70
00:02:50,539 --> 00:02:54,750
[Applause]

71
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,800
we also as you know thanks to some of

72
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:02,840
the folks in colorado

73
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,560
have a very

74
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,239
explicit

75
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,120
statement

76
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:11,280
from then candidate trump

77
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,120
about where he stood

78
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,439
and you've probably all seen the clip he

79
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:19,360
very clearly said the states ought to be

80
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:21,280
able to do what the states are doing

81
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,360
i think it's important to

82
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:26,318
help candidate trump

83
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,319
remember what he said

84
00:03:26,318 --> 00:03:30,560
remember that

85
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:31,759
millions of people who voted for donald

86
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,400
trump

87
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:36,959
voted for cannabis

88
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:39,599
and that we are watching

89
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:41,280
all the dire predictions that the goofy

90
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:44,798
folks that have been arguing against his

91
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:47,680
three years they've fallen apart

92
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:49,840
30 states have moved into this space

93
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,599
including i'm very pleased with what

94
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:55,039
some of you have helped bring about in

95
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:58,158
oregon washington colorado

96
00:03:55,039 --> 00:04:01,519
the sun still sets in the west

97
00:03:58,158 --> 00:04:05,120
big rocks haven't fallen out of the sky

98
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:07,519
children still go to high school

99
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:10,560
what's happened is we've watched an 8

100
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:12,879
billion dollar industry emerge

101
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,799
200 000 people

102
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:19,279
employed

103
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:22,319
we've watched the industry maturity

104
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:24,879
some of you here been on the front lines

105
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:27,439
i am excited about what we have seen in

106
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:30,319
the last five years in washington dc

107
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:32,560
having people from this industry

108
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:34,639
making the case

109
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,439
the simple case

110
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,439
of what they want

111
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,040
they want to be able

112
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:44,960
to pay

113
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,960
fair taxes with a check

114
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:51,680
how hard is that

115
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:53,199
[Applause]

116
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,519
you want

117
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:59,120
the federal government to respect the

118
00:04:55,519 --> 00:05:01,758
will of millions of voters from maine to

119
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:05,600
california

120
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:06,639
you want the insane prohibitions

121
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,800
against

122
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,120
clinical research

123
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,680
on cannabis to be

124
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,360
done away with

125
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,959
that restricts

126
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:21,759
the opportunities we've got to mature

127
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:24,399
the industry to be able to develop

128
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:26,639
important effective tests

129
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:29,359
for impairment

130
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:32,478
this is a critical issue

131
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,520
as you know there are 20 million people

132
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:35,758
a month

133
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:37,359
who use cannabis

134
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,919
and many people

135
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:42,560
i mean i i've lost track of the number

136
00:05:39,918 --> 00:05:47,049
of people who've told me that medical

137
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:50,660
marijuana has changed their lives

138
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:50,660
[Applause]

139
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:58,160
and it is totally mainstream

140
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:02,719
you want

141
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,840
to make sure

142
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,680
that the veterans

143
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:11,839
administration doctors

144
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,840
can talk to america's veterans

145
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,519
in states where it is legal

146
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:26,079
but it's not just for our veterans who

147
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:27,039
who die too frequently from overdose who

148
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:29,439
have been

149
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:31,839
given opioids

150
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:34,639
at a frequency far

151
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:36,079
far in excess of the general population

152
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,840
and are denied

153
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:40,879
a medication

154
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:44,959
that can be transformative

155
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:47,120
it shouldn't be that hard

156
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:50,000
well we're coming in to what i think now

157
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:52,319
is the home stretch i was appalled

158
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,240
at what jeff sessions did

159
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:58,639
but the more i reflected on it

160
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,160
it may be a favor

161
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,478
as i've been campaigning around the

162
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:05,199
country i have made the prediction and a

163
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:06,800
number of bets

164
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,240
that this

165
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,439
crusade

166
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,439
is over in five years

167
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:14,318
well

168
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,079
that was

169
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:18,319
last year so i've only got four years

170
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:18,318
left

171
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:24,240
but i think

172
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:26,719
if we all do our job

173
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:29,439
thanks to jeff sessions we can cut that

174
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,440
time in half

175
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:34,160
we've got people who are involved that

176
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:37,199
have not been involved before we have

177
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:40,800
more media attention and we are getting

178
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:42,080
more people in congress

179
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,560
you know i've

180
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:46,560
mentioned uh warbacher blumenauer

181
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,079
amendment was easier

182
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,879
to get into

183
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:53,279
the continuing resolution than any other

184
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:55,439
time that we've dealt with

185
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:57,038
congress

186
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:58,879
is pretty much aligned it's the best

187
00:07:57,038 --> 00:08:01,360
congress we've ever had

188
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:05,520
virtually every one of my democratic

189
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:08,889
colleagues and now dozens of republicans

190
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:12,549
are on board

191
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:12,550
[Applause]

192
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:17,680
but let's just lay it out the republican

193
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:20,639
leadership

194
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,319
would not even allow us

195
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,400
a vote

196
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:27,680
this last year

197
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:29,839
on continuing now we're in reasonably

198
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:32,719
good shape as well the continuing

199
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:34,799
resolution has the provision

200
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,879
we have if we ever get around to

201
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:40,000
actually passing a budget

202
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:42,240
how quaint is that

203
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,080
it's on the senate side and we've got as

204
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,360
i mentioned strong support on the house

205
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,200
side

206
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,440
we've got a problem with some people in

207
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:52,399
key positions who messed with us who

208
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,959
took my veterans access legislation that

209
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:56,480
passed both the house and the senate in

210
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:58,000
last congress

211
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,120
and took it out

212
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,120
in a conference committee

213
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,600
that has to change

214
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:09,360
let me tell you what i'm doing

215
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,278
because this is

216
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:15,680
probably an area that i'm spending more

217
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:17,919
time on legislatively than any other

218
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:20,079
first and foremost

219
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:22,559
i'm trying to make sure that all my

220
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,720
democratic colleagues are in line

221
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:27,039
it's a huge percentage but they're not

222
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:30,000
all there and i'm working to make sure

223
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:32,000
that everybody understands

224
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,559
these issues

225
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,360
second i have communicated with every

226
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:40,000
man and woman running as a democrat for

227
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:42,480
congress and there's a gazillion of them

228
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,519
lots of energy

229
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:48,879
about these issues how to talk about how

230
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:52,720
it is important for them to take

231
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:52,720
an unequivocal position

232
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,440
there's no problem politically if they

233
00:09:55,278 --> 00:09:58,958
do i think there's a problem politically

234
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,279
if they don't

235
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:03,599
i will go to my grave

236
00:10:01,278 --> 00:10:07,120
convinced that if hillary clinton could

237
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:09,680
have given a coherent answer on cannabis

238
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,679
she'd be president today

239
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:13,838
and it wasn't that i didn't tell her or

240
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:16,399
that you didn't tell her

241
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:16,399
it's just

242
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:22,959
skittishness an inauthentic answer of

243
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:24,639
something that she knew

244
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:26,958
and i think frankly she played a

245
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:30,319
political prize

246
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:33,199
i want people this go around

247
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:36,240
who aren't with us who aren't helpful

248
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:39,920
who aren't specific

249
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,919
i want them to pay a political price

250
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:43,600
i've zeroed in on a couple of people who

251
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:46,479
have been

252
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:48,320
extraordinarily unhealthy we've already

253
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,519
had a nice little billboard in pete

254
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:53,600
sessions district with a veteran asking

255
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:56,560
why pete sessions doesn't want him to

256
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,560
have his medicine

257
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:03,199
we are

258
00:10:59,278 --> 00:11:06,480
going to make sure that this is a

259
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:08,160
political issue

260
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,240
and you

261
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:13,679
need to make sure

262
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:16,000
this is a political issue number one

263
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:19,039
anybody who's got a facility with

264
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,958
customers coming in and out

265
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:24,240
there ought to be a little

266
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:24,239
vote cannabis

267
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:29,839
poster there ought to be voter

268
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:29,839
registration cards

269
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:39,360
this is not rocket science

270
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,320
and this motivates

271
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:44,079
particularly young people

272
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:48,399
we need to make sure that that

273
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:49,838
motivation is acted upon

274
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:52,240
now you're starting to have a political

275
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:54,399
footprint people are starting to notice

276
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,639
an eight billion dollar industry

277
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:58,879
you're watching what is happening

278
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:01,360
some of the politicians are starting to

279
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:02,720
come around

280
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,519
there ought to be

281
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:07,200
some very specific conversations

282
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,839
about where they stand and what they're

283
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,839
going to do

284
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:14,719
next

285
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:16,799
we need to flood capitol hill

286
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,560
over the next few months with people

287
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:20,240
from the industry i will tell you one of

288
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:22,399
the reasons we're in a more powerful

289
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:25,680
position we've ever been is because

290
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:29,039
people in today's cannabis industry have

291
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:29,039
turned out in force

292
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:35,120
and it's making a difference

293
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:37,120
they're watching the old stereotypes

294
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:40,320
of meltaway

295
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:42,560
people today are serious business people

296
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,399
they care deeply about their customers

297
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:46,559
and their product

298
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:48,240
the people i've worked with in oregon

299
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:49,199
around the country

300
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,360
really

301
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:54,320
make a difference

302
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:57,839
we need to make sure that that new face

303
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:59,360
of the cannabis industry is on display

304
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:02,079
in washington

305
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:04,720
and talking about what the impacts are

306
00:13:02,078 --> 00:13:07,838
having a cloud over financing over

307
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:11,120
banking the impact of not being able to

308
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:11,120
be taxed fairly

309
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:18,319
and you are powerful spokespeople

310
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:22,560
very powerful spencer

311
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:24,959
we're continuing with our bipartisan

312
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:26,719
cannabis caucus

313
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:28,879
i mean i don't like what the republican

314
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:32,959
leadership has done with this but i have

315
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:34,559
worked with pro-cannabis republicans

316
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:37,199
two of my

317
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:40,078
co-chairs of the cannabis caucus are

318
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,920
republicans if you would have told me

319
00:13:40,078 --> 00:13:44,078
20 years ago when i'm working on this

320
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:46,319
that one of the first co-chairs of our

321
00:13:44,078 --> 00:13:48,399
cannabis caucus would be an 83 year old

322
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,800
republican from alaska

323
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,320
i might have taken that back

324
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:54,078
but don young

325
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:57,199
is terrific

326
00:13:54,078 --> 00:14:02,719
dana rohrabacher has been tireless

327
00:13:57,198 --> 00:14:05,599
i took the 280e legislation that

328
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:08,959
grover norquist

329
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:11,199
famous republican tax activists

330
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:13,359
appeared with me when we had our first

331
00:14:11,198 --> 00:14:15,198
press conference grover was there

332
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,360
talking about how that was

333
00:14:15,198 --> 00:14:19,919
inappropriate

334
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:22,000
and we've packaged it and given it to

335
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:24,799
carlos cabello

336
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,600
as my partner now in the in the house

337
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:27,120
he's

338
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,560
terrific

339
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,039
i saw

340
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:32,799
uh we're here a moment ago from senator

341
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:34,319
wyden's office

342
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:35,599
senator wyden

343
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,879
and i have

344
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,440
introduced

345
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:41,519
comprehensive legislation that would

346
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,680
solve the problem

347
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:46,000
but i'm excited that there are now

348
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:48,078
dozens of people who are coming forward

349
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,759
with their proposals

350
00:14:48,078 --> 00:14:51,599
we're encouraging them we want more

351
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:53,360
voices as long as it's consistent and

352
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,680
it's moving in the right direction we

353
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:58,879
think that's terrific

354
00:14:55,679 --> 00:15:02,000
and we'll continue to build on that

355
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:02,000
bipartisan effect

356
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:08,078
we need you

357
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,159
to carry that

358
00:15:08,078 --> 00:15:12,159
not just to capitol hill

359
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:14,879
not just having your little voter

360
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:17,278
registration not just having serious

361
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:19,679
conversations with candidates when they

362
00:15:17,278 --> 00:15:20,879
pop up

363
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:22,879
we need you

364
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:26,000
to be able to pull

365
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:27,679
those people

366
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,958
on the ground

367
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:31,039
look at

368
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:33,278
i had three national

369
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:35,439
industry phone calls

370
00:15:33,278 --> 00:15:36,240
in the aftermath of this confusion one

371
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,399
of the

372
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,680
messages that we are delivering

373
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,720
is that

374
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:45,359
bring

375
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:45,360
people from capitol hill to you

376
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:50,479
this is a congressional recess

377
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:53,120
for the house of representatives

378
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,959
i'm encouraging people to look at what

379
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,600
the recess

380
00:15:54,958 --> 00:16:00,239
calendar looks like

381
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:02,560
and use that time to invite

382
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:05,198
members of the house and senate across

383
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:06,638
the country to come in and see what you

384
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:08,719
do

385
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:10,480
look at your business look at the

386
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:15,040
commercial facilities look at the

387
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:16,560
growing applications look at the retail

388
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:18,958
it's important a lot of people are

389
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:21,039
making a judgment who have no idea what

390
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:23,198
you're doing

391
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:26,879
and the more they interact i think the

392
00:16:23,198 --> 00:16:30,319
better off we're going to be

393
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:32,240
i hope that you are relentless

394
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:35,759
in making sure

395
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,480
that everybody in the industry meets

396
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:39,039
your

397
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:41,680
high standards

398
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:43,759
i have met people who take great pride

399
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:46,239
and a number of them use the term they

400
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:49,959
want to be the gold standard

401
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,959
they want to be the best

402
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,440
we need to make sure

403
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:58,399
that there is no

404
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,680
area where people are stepping over the

405
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:04,318
line

406
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:07,038
selling product to miners is obscene

407
00:17:04,318 --> 00:17:11,279
and we need to make sure that it does

408
00:17:07,038 --> 00:17:12,400
not happen in oregon or anyplace else

409
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:14,318
and i know

410
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,319
most of you are rigorous i've watched

411
00:17:14,318 --> 00:17:17,918
you in action

412
00:17:16,318 --> 00:17:19,199
but we've had some problems you read

413
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:21,839
about him here

414
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:24,240
that cannot continue

415
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:26,480
that's an open invitation

416
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:29,519
to upset the upper

417
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:31,440
it'll come back to haunt us

418
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:34,639
you heard steve talk about

419
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:36,880
leakage of product

420
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:39,200
it can't happen

421
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,960
we've got to make sure

422
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,720
that what i think

423
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:45,600
we were able to put across in oregon

424
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:47,600
which is i think the model legislation

425
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:48,959
we've got cooperation from the

426
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:51,279
legislature

427
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:53,120
from the state regulatory agency we've

428
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:55,119
had industry leadership

429
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:57,918
we've got to make sure

430
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:59,918
that we keep that commitment

431
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:02,320
that we all made to the oregon voters

432
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:04,240
this is the system we're going to abide

433
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:05,759
by

434
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,558
and it's important

435
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:08,558
that we do that

436
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,919
i want to thank you

437
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:13,679
for your help

438
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:15,520
your encouragement

439
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:17,919
for what you're doing in an area that

440
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:20,319
i've been involved with now over 40

441
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:20,320
years

442
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:30,639
if you would have told me in 1973 when

443
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:34,079
we had our first

444
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:35,759
bill that would have about uh two plants

445
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:36,639
uh per household

446
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:39,440
um

447
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,640
then it would have taken 44 years to get

448
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:44,080
where we are

449
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:46,320
i don't think i would have believed it

450
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:47,759
but if you would have told me

451
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:50,079
10 years ago

452
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:52,400
about our rapid progress the development

453
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:55,359
the movement the public support i don't

454
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:59,440
think i wouldn't believe that either

455
00:18:55,359 --> 00:19:01,199
we're in a spot now

456
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,038
where we can drag it across the finish

457
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:06,240
line where you can work with me so that

458
00:19:03,038 --> 00:19:07,759
i'm not a liar that we get this done

459
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,240
this next year

460
00:19:07,759 --> 00:19:12,400
we can do that

461
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:15,279
part of it and i will work day and night

462
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:18,880
to be able to make sure that the chair

463
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:20,879
of the house judiciary committee is not

464
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,760
about good luck from virginia

465
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,120
who's

466
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:26,319
not our friend

467
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:28,879
but jerry nadler from new york who

468
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:30,480
in 77

469
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:33,600
voted in

470
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:35,360
new york to decriminalize and who's been

471
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:37,439
with us every step of the way in the

472
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:40,319
legislation in congress

473
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,320
these things matter

474
00:19:40,798 --> 00:19:45,038
i will stop at this point

475
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:48,240
i will

476
00:19:45,038 --> 00:19:50,319
continue to follow through with you we

477
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:53,279
continue to want you to be able to

478
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:55,599
provide our office with information that

479
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:58,720
we need to know about

480
00:19:55,599 --> 00:20:00,079
we need to make sure that we're moving

481
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,000
not just

482
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:05,119
legislatively but you know it looks like

483
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,839
we've got shots in missouri and michigan

484
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:10,159
new hampshire house of representatives

485
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:11,519
passed a pro-cannabis

486
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:13,038
legislation

487
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:15,200
this week

488
00:20:13,038 --> 00:20:16,798
we need to keep the pressure up on all

489
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,038
of those

490
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:21,599
but accept my thanks

491
00:20:19,038 --> 00:20:23,679
accept my commitment to work with you to

492
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:26,558
make sure that we do what we need to do

493
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,600
legislatively politically and with the

494
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:30,000
public

495
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:32,798
because i truly think

496
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:37,038
our time has come and next year we can

497
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:40,599
get it accomplished once and for all

498
00:20:37,038 --> 00:20:40,599
thank you very much
