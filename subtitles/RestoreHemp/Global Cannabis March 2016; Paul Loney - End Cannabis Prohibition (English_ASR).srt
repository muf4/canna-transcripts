1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,459
how many folks here want to have a job

2
00:00:03,318 --> 00:00:09,240
how many folks here won't have a place

3
00:00:05,459 --> 00:00:10,888
to live well guess what our state

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,199
legislature they don't care if you have

5
00:00:10,888 --> 00:00:14,879
a job if you're a marijuana consumer

6
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:17,038
they don't care if you have a place to

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,260
live your marijuana consumer far as

8
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,270
they're concerned you can be hungry and

9
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:24,029
homeless living on the streets if you

10
00:00:21,269 --> 00:00:26,698
use marijuana that's why we march folks

11
00:00:24,028 --> 00:00:28,768
the city of Portland as was mentioned

12
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:31,109
earlier they asked as why are you guys

13
00:00:28,768 --> 00:00:34,500
still marching I thought we fixed

14
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:36,660
everything and it's like no people you

15
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,460
know we have consumers right you mean

16
00:00:36,659 --> 00:00:41,099
you have businesses out there businesses

17
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:44,009
can now sell but where can you use it if

18
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,480
you're a renter you cannot use it in

19
00:00:44,009 --> 00:00:48,689
your home if your lanterns and want it

20
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:50,909
most employers they'll fire you if you

21
00:00:48,689 --> 00:00:54,030
turn a positive and a urine test for THC

22
00:00:50,909 --> 00:00:56,398
metabolites they don't care whether we

23
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:58,770
smoked a month ago they're going to fire

24
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,989
you that's why we're here folks that's

25
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:02,930
why we march and we march for our

26
00:01:00,988 --> 00:01:05,670
brothers and sisters who can't march

27
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:08,400
publicly in cities around Oregon even

28
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:10,500
where they have to hide their belief in

29
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,049
a marijuana plant that marijuana plant

30
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:14,969
is the best plan for them remember that

31
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:17,580
that's why we're marching for folks that

32
00:01:14,969 --> 00:01:19,140
can't March is there you know there

33
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:21,900
would be blackballed by the local

34
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:24,390
jurisdiction that they did can we march

35
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:28,140
because we need to have our rights to

36
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:30,780
gather in public and use marijuana when

37
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:33,659
we want to you know it's again our state

38
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:36,420
legislature says you guys can't smoke

39
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:38,310
marijuana if you're a renter guess what

40
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:41,790
it's legal so you can't but it's not

41
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:44,579
legal folks I'm sorry measure 91 you

42
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:47,189
know which I helped draft oh you know it

43
00:01:44,578 --> 00:01:49,679
was a partial stepped we are not there

44
00:01:47,188 --> 00:01:52,169
yet and don't let anybody ever tell you

45
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,570
that we have legalization we have the

46
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:56,939
best model in the country when it's only

47
00:01:54,569 --> 00:01:59,489
part way belt now we have to make sure

48
00:01:56,938 --> 00:02:02,008
that we have a place to live a place we

49
00:01:59,489 --> 00:02:03,959
have social clubs and that the fact that

50
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:06,149
the city of Portland you know they don't

51
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:07,559
charge they're charging outrageous sums

52
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:10,229
of money if you want to get into

53
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:13,140
marijuana business you know again it

54
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:13,560
falls right into the say legislature and

55
00:02:13,139 --> 00:02:15,689
the

56
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:19,469
bureaucrats they would only like to

57
00:02:15,689 --> 00:02:21,509
regulate a few large industries dealing

58
00:02:19,469 --> 00:02:23,359
with marijuana we have to tell know that

59
00:02:21,509 --> 00:02:26,699
this is truly a cottage industry

60
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:30,180
everybody has a right to grow and sell

61
00:02:26,699 --> 00:02:32,488
marijuana with minimal fees not

62
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:34,110
expensive fees sorry just remember that

63
00:02:32,489 --> 00:02:36,000
when you're out there when you're

64
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:38,069
talking to your friends saying why did

65
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,840
you spend a beautiful Saturday in the

66
00:02:38,068 --> 00:02:42,238
streets of Portland well you could have

67
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,219
been home gardening or doing something

68
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,590
else because we had we're losing our

69
00:02:44,219 --> 00:02:48,568
rights folks you know they say oh you

70
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:51,180
guys you have legal marijuana you can go

71
00:02:48,568 --> 00:02:54,738
into a store oh and here's my favorite

72
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:57,269
if you're a patient you can buy tax-free

73
00:02:54,739 --> 00:02:59,610
it's like well what good does that do if

74
00:02:57,269 --> 00:03:01,140
the patient is low income you know

75
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:04,110
wouldn't be four they were getting it

76
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:05,879
for free you know and taxes only we're

77
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:08,430
going to be twenty percent who's paying

78
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:10,829
for the other eighty percent you know so

79
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:13,230
that doesn't make any sense right so and

80
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:15,060
it was Anna was talking about not just

81
00:03:13,229 --> 00:03:17,729
write and call your lettuce I just go

82
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:20,340
visit them when they have a town hall

83
00:03:17,729 --> 00:03:22,469
and they all love Gabby's little town

84
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:25,920
halls go talk to them tell them who you

85
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:28,680
are they need to see real people because

86
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:31,409
right now you know down in Salem they're

87
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:33,480
seeing the big business folks and we

88
00:03:31,409 --> 00:03:36,180
can't let marijuana become big business

89
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:38,310
here in Oregon we need to show the

90
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:40,230
entire world that we grow the best

91
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:44,069
marijuana in the world and we have the

92
00:03:40,229 --> 00:03:46,169
most freedoms with it so and if Anna is

93
00:03:44,068 --> 00:03:49,469
still out there I'm sure she want me to

94
00:03:46,169 --> 00:03:51,719
help lead folks in this little thing we

95
00:03:49,469 --> 00:03:54,239
have to say so back here in my poster

96
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:55,979
you know these four things when you have

97
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,239
an officer comes up to you you still

98
00:03:55,979 --> 00:04:00,000
need to remember these even though

99
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:04,759
marijuana's somewhat legal so I go

100
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,759

and I wish to speak to my attorney yeah

106
00:04:24,908 --> 00:04:28,680
