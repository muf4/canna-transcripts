00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,020
hey thank you guys thanks for everybody

2
00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:06,778
showing up if we don't show up we don't

3
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:10,138
blow up so we encourage everybody to get

4
00:00:06,778 --> 00:00:12,089
out to all the events represent and make

5
00:00:10,138 --> 00:00:14,548
sure that we can hold the people who got

6
00:00:12,089 --> 00:00:16,920
this industry moving that we can all

7
00:00:14,548 --> 00:00:18,989
transition into this industry these

8
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,670
green rushes are moving in they're

9
00:00:18,989 --> 00:00:22,679
trying to like wipe us all out for

10
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:25,109
pennies on the dollar that's been their

11
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:27,179
plan they really have no heart and soul

12
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:28,740
into cannabis so when you go out there

13
00:00:27,179 --> 00:00:31,739
and spend your hard-earned money at

14
00:00:28,739 --> 00:00:33,629
cannabis support the stores and support

15
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:35,850
the locations that support the people

16
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:37,170
who brought you here it's been a long

17
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:39,270
road for all of us

18
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:41,879
my wife was part of the first collective

19
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:44,520
garden in San Diego in 1996 our

20
00:00:41,878 --> 00:00:49,308
collective got a raided in San Diego in

21
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:51,899
1999 where I was arrested for 448 plants

22
00:00:49,308 --> 00:00:53,399
we've done a lot of things everybody's

23
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:55,109
done a lot of things we put a lot of

24
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:57,090
energy into this and we need to get

25
00:00:55,109 --> 00:00:59,159
something back you know we really need

26
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:01,739
to hold on to our medical laws we'll be

27
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:03,808
seen what happened in Washington is a

28
00:01:01,738 --> 00:01:05,338
disgrace to medical and it's really a

29
00:01:03,808 --> 00:01:07,679
disgrace to all the efforts that

30
00:01:05,338 --> 00:01:09,150
everybody put in the same people who

31
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,880
fought against this tooth and nail

32
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:14,189
Inslee and all the rest of us who fought

33
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:17,219
against cannabis now we'll go to the

34
00:01:14,188 --> 00:01:19,798
death to protect the tax dollar so that

35
00:01:17,219 --> 00:01:21,719
our plan really worked our plan was to

36
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:24,390
like get them addicted to the money and

37
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:25,890
then we'll be able to legalize so

38
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:28,140
they're all addicted it's spreading

39
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:30,569
across the country states are lining up

40
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:32,280
they all want to cash in on it but we

41
00:01:30,569 --> 00:01:35,250
still need to show up at these events

42
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:37,290
and let our voice be heard to make sure

43
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:39,180
that the small guys and the small

44
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:41,850
farmers and the crafts farmers don't get

45
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:43,829
wiped out the big talk now is a race to

46
00:01:41,849 --> 00:01:46,140
the bottom well we saw the race to the

47
00:01:43,828 --> 00:01:48,149
bottom come in years ago because there's

48
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:50,969
big corporations already out there who

49
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:53,399
are ready to lose 30 to 50 million

50
00:01:50,969 --> 00:01:56,280
dollars to create market to capture

51
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:58,920
market share so when you go out there

52
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:02,609
make conscious choices on what you buy

53
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:04,170
buy organic buy clean buy local just

54
00:02:02,609 --> 00:02:06,478
like we do here in the Pacific Northwest

55
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:09,239
and Oregon we need to do the same for

56
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:10,949
cannabis it's not about the dollar the

57
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:11,659
lower the price the probably the crop

58
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:14,419
your weeds your

59
00:02:11,659 --> 00:02:17,000
getting so support your local growers

60
00:02:14,419 --> 00:02:19,879
organic growers and keep on showing up

61
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,889
at the events and you know show up on a

62
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:24,650
regular basis and you could really make

63
00:02:21,889 --> 00:02:26,419
a change in the cannabis movement so
