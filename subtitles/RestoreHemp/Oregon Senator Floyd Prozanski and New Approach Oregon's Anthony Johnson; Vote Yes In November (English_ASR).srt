1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,879
maybe we can expand on why it seen is is

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:08,759
a good thing that the OLCC regulates

3
00:00:05,878 --> 00:00:10,119
recreational marijuana when presumably

4
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:12,160
they don't have any experience with

5
00:00:10,119 --> 00:00:14,518
cannabis I'd be uh particularly

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,079
interested on the consumption side of it

7
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:17,079
as far as

8
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:23,399
monitoring yeah the uh OLCC you know

9
00:00:21,399 --> 00:00:24,959
they they have experience with alcohol

10
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:27,479
they have experience with licensing

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:30,000
rules regulations audits sting

12
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:32,279
operations collecting Taxation and so

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,719
they have experience dealing with you

14
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:38,120
know a relatively similar product so as

15
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:40,239
all the government agencies goes they

16
00:00:38,119 --> 00:00:42,320
just happen to be the best one for this

17
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:43,759
program the Oregon Health Authority with

18
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,039
some with some experience dealing with

19
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:47,439
medical cannabis really made it clear

20
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:49,320
that they only wanted to stick with

21
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:51,759
medical cannabis and didn't want to move

22
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:54,000
into adult use over 21 so we really

23
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:55,878
didn't want to have an antagonistic

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,039
relationship with a government agency

25
00:00:55,878 --> 00:00:59,920
that didn't really want the regulations

26
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:02,280
starting a brand new regulation on

27
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:05,879
unfortunately there are startup costs

28
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:07,920
associated with that and and so when you

29
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:09,679
start off with the state saying this

30
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,560
brand new agency is going to cost $22

31
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:16,200
million a year um for whether that's

32
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:18,200
true or not that uh really puts you in

33
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,280
in a tough position to win the election

34
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,840
so the OLCC you know has experience with

35
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:25,159
these type of rules and regulations and

36
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:28,280
uh they are definitely looking to be

37
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:30,439
educated from patients consumers people

38
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:32,320
in the industry how Washington and

39
00:01:30,438 --> 00:01:34,599
Colorado's gone and they're definitely

40
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:37,118
looking to have you know work groups

41
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:38,640
around the various issues to to educate

42
00:01:37,118 --> 00:01:41,239
themselves and that's one of the reasons

43
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,799
why we give the OLCC a full year to

44
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:45,798
develop the rules and regulations so

45
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:48,439
they have time to uh to learn about

46
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:50,200
cannabis bring in experts and pass you

47
00:01:48,438 --> 00:01:52,158
know Common Sense rules and

48
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:54,280
regulations yeah that's one of the

49
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,960
things that was impressive for me is

50
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:58,200
ensuring that you have an agency that

51
00:01:55,959 --> 00:02:02,319
actually has some expertise in

52
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,920
regulations of uh substances this is U

53
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:05,959
from my perspective what new approach

54
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,598
Oregon was able to do is come together

55
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:10,878
with a existing facility so you will not

56
00:02:08,598 --> 00:02:13,839
find us needing to actually start from

57
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:15,159
Ground Zero as Anthony says uh one of

58
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,159
the things that is very important to

59
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:18,959
myself and many people that serve in the

60
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:21,239
legislature is that we do away with the

61
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:24,439
black market or the Underground Market

62
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:27,319
and uh by having the uh taxing structure

63
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:29,079
that they have placed in in in order uh

64
00:02:27,318 --> 00:02:31,280
to move forward actually will give us

65
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:33,239
that best opport opportunity to undercut

66
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,800
we've seen historically when you look at

67
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:36,840
what happened with alcohol when it was

68
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:40,239
prohibited and when it came back you can

69
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:43,598
actually have the impact of undoing uh

70
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:46,000
the cartel type of philosophies uh by

71
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:49,238
actually having a well-regulated

72
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,919
industry I also believe that the OLCC

73
00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:54,000
knowing for uh my discussions from uh

74
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:55,839
the executive director they're not

75
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,400
waiting until this passes they're

76
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,640
already there as Anthony says working

77
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,800
and watching and seeing from those who

78
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:03,919
are actually implementing in Colorado as

79
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,799
well as what's happening now in

80
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:09,000
Washington to be ready for uh what is

81
00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:11,040
going to come forward and the I guess

82
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,719
not saving grace but I think the the

83
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:14,798
part of having a deep breath and

84
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:16,439
ensuring that we move forward in a

85
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:18,959
positive light is that there is a

86
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:21,158
one-year incubation to actually have it

87
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,000
up and running uh but clearly I can tell

88
00:03:21,158 --> 00:03:25,439
you right now that uh Steve marks who is

89
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,519
the executive director of OLCC uh has

90
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:29,560
been on the phone with me and he has

91
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:32,360
made it very clear that he's working

92
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:34,479
with the department of a as well as the

93
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:36,640
Oregon Health Authority because the

94
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:38,318
measure itself deals not only with the

95
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:40,238
recreational part but also brings

96
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:42,759
forward some of the stuff I've worked on

97
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,519
in industrial hemp and also where you

98
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:45,798
have the medical part and I think we'll

99
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:47,959
get into some of the questions that we

100
00:03:45,799 --> 00:03:51,159
go into greater detail why it's so

101
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:53,120
important that this uh uh measure that

102
00:03:51,158 --> 00:03:55,039
new approach organ has put forward

103
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:58,120
actually calls out that we're going to

104
00:03:55,039 --> 00:04:00,639
maintain a separate uh system for the

105
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:03,280
medical and it's not going to be blended

106
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:06,318
into the retail such as what has been

107
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,318
discussed at the Maran

108
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:12,280
state so let's let's address that what

109
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:15,238
what will happen to the or Oregon

110
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:17,720
medical marijuana program if this passes

111
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:19,639
and if OMMP continues will there be

112
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:22,320
separate dispensaries for medical and

113
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:22,319
recreational

114
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,959
purposes well I guess starting off from

115
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:32,519
where we're at yes I expected they will

116
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:34,719
one om p is going to stay in place the

117
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:37,120
uh new approach measure

118
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:40,120
ip53 uh calls that out and distinctly

119
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,800
says it will stand alone uh the

120
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:43,399
important part of that is because I

121
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,879
think the needs are very important for

122
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:48,038
all of us to realize as to exactly what

123
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:50,800
that program was set up for and what IT

124
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:53,279
addresses uh I was fortunate to be able

125
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:56,000
to uh help move forward after the

126
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:57,879
measure passed back in 1998 we had about

127
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,360
10 years that ran and actually showed

128
00:04:57,879 --> 00:05:01,240
how the medical marijuana program was

129
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,240
working working how efficient it was and

130
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:05,478
how it was actually helping patients to

131
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,800
actually get the relief they want uh

132
00:05:05,478 --> 00:05:09,758
knowing that and knowing that the

133
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,639
citizens actually passed uh that uh

134
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:16,919
measure which was if I'm not mistaken

135
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:18,680
was um ballot measure 67 uh back in 1998

136
00:05:16,918 --> 00:05:20,519
uh what we basically have seen is that

137
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:22,240
it has actually worked to the point of

138
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:25,159
where we wanted to give the patients in

139
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:28,600
Oregon more control more assurance and

140
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:30,720
protection so in in 2009 I was able to

141
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,800
get my colleagues to actually support

142
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,319
changing the scheduling of marijuana

143
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,840
from a schedule one which is identified

144
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:42,120
as having no Municipal purposes to a

145
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:42,119
schedule two and so we are one

146
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:48,918
of we are the only state that I know

147
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:50,879
that has actually taken the step to

148
00:05:48,918 --> 00:05:52,959
actually recognize what the people of

149
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:55,319
this state have said that we believe it

150
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:57,638
doesn't have a medical purposes and use

151
00:05:55,319 --> 00:06:00,160
and it should be uh uh clarified and

152
00:05:57,639 --> 00:06:01,960
classified to be a scheduled to drug and

153
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,880
so that is something that for me is very

154
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:06,478
important and clearly as long as the

155
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:08,759
federal government is let's say behind

156
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:10,560
and coming up where the people of this

157
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:12,199
state and 20 other states in the

158
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,680
District of Columbia are at as it

159
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:16,360
pertains to medical marijuana U until

160
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:18,038
they make the change from a schedule one

161
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,400
to a schedule two we have to do

162
00:06:18,038 --> 00:06:22,079
everything we can to protect our

163
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:22,079
patients in this

164
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:27,199
state we've addressed this a little bit

165
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:29,639
um maybe you could expand on what impact

166
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:31,919
this uh legalization might have on the

167
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,918
black

168
00:06:32,918 --> 00:06:37,478
market well my goal is to put it out of

169
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:40,639
business I mean the reality is we have

170
00:06:37,478 --> 00:06:42,719
an opportunity uh to have it an industry

171
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:45,038
become more legitimate and out from

172
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:48,479
underneath the uh the rocks and from

173
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:50,478
behind um you know closed doors and and

174
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:52,000
Alleyways and everything else to the

175
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:54,000
point of where you can actually have a

176
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,478
viable industry that's actually going to

177
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,598
be producing Revenue that can go into

178
00:06:56,478 --> 00:07:01,360
the state general fund to pay for

179
00:06:58,598 --> 00:07:04,279
education uh human resource issues

180
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:07,120
health and wellness as well as for uh

181
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:10,198
Public Safety needs and so I do in fact

182
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:12,360
think that you're going to see uh the

183
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:14,520
the let's say the turning away and the

184
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:16,960
drying up of the uh of the black market

185
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:18,878
as it stands today and that you will in

186
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:21,758
fact and many of the people I represent

187
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:24,720
in the district I represent uh are

188
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:27,280
looking forward of coming uh out and

189
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:30,080
being more public and being able to

190
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:32,119
actually be accountable for what they do

191
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:35,318
and not be behind the scenes and being

192
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:36,879
concerned as to uh uh who might be uh

193
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:38,439
knocking on the doors be it law

194
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:40,680
enforcement or the bad guys trying to

195
00:07:38,439 --> 00:07:42,639
get in and uh take what they what

196
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:45,759
they're doing right now and this is

197
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:47,960
something that spans Beyond urban areas

198
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:50,000
uh I represent a lot of rural areas of

199
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:51,318
Douglas and Lane counties and I can tell

200
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,639
you that there are a lot of people have

201
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:54,879
spoken to me about this topic and they

202
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:56,960
think that this is something that's

203
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,919
right for the state and it will make us

204
00:07:56,959 --> 00:08:00,120
all better for it and we'll have the

205
00:07:58,918 --> 00:08:01,639
accountabil

206
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,639
and the responsibilities will be in

207
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:05,598
place and then we are actually will see

208
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:08,879
Revenue coming forward that will help us

209
00:08:05,598 --> 00:08:08,878
as a state
