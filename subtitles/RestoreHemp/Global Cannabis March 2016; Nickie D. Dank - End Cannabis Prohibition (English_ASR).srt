1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,220
hi everybody and I mean hig a tie what a

2
00:00:06,028 --> 00:00:12,780
spectacular day here in pollen door

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:15,059
again thank you mother nature bear with

4
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:17,969
me a little my PTSD is kicking a little

5
00:00:15,058 --> 00:00:22,710
hard right now so just bear with me you

6
00:00:17,969 --> 00:00:25,618
guys so do we have to say to our state

7
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:28,320
again what's wrong with all these

8
00:00:25,618 --> 00:00:30,589
changes you keep making that continue to

9
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:34,399
happen and have happen to our cannabis

10
00:00:30,589 --> 00:00:37,380
medical program in the last year or so

11
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:42,500
always somebody or something has tried

12
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:45,780
to change us leave our medicine alone

13
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:49,500
that seems to be the words that have

14
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:52,469
been said or used by most how many times

15
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:55,890
have you said it or heard someone else

16
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:58,469
say it gee do you think anybody's

17
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:01,980
listening and know that we can hear

18
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:05,129
ourselves saying it who's listening come

19
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:07,829
on state of Oregon our state had one of

20
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:11,790
the best medical cannabis programs to me

21
00:01:07,829 --> 00:01:14,819
I am a multi-state medical cannabis card

22
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:17,820
holder now that medical has paved the

23
00:01:14,819 --> 00:01:20,728
way for recreational recreational will

24
00:01:17,819 --> 00:01:26,758
ultimately take over and be servicing

25
00:01:20,728 --> 00:01:34,408
our ommp in the end this sounds crazy to

26
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:36,650
me disappointed disappointed is one of

27
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:43,170
the strongest words that this Oregon

28
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:46,020
Oregonian can say I like a lot of you

29
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:49,500
have had to make constant change in the

30
00:01:46,019 --> 00:01:53,039
past few years social clubs closing

31
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:55,049
because of the Clean Air Act my markets

32
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,710
closed because they couldn't be

33
00:01:55,049 --> 00:02:01,500
regulated by the state my friends died

34
00:01:58,709 --> 00:02:05,478
because it was more important for them

35
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,478
to be treated with pharmaceuticals

36
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:14,120
then the choice of cannabis what else

37
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:15,890
must mean we give up well I'm not

38
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:19,129
willing to give up my medical cannabis

39
00:02:15,889 --> 00:02:21,109
card and if they end this program they

40
00:02:19,129 --> 00:02:27,379
will be literally ripping the card out

41
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:31,130
of my hand our hands my friends hands my

42
00:02:27,379 --> 00:02:35,030
family's hands seems like paying it

43
00:02:31,129 --> 00:02:38,870
forward or giving back Oregon can be the

44
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:42,469
ultimate reward in closing I would love

45
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:45,200
