00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:45,509
political committee that's circulating a

15
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:48,058
petition the Oregon cannabis Tax Act

16
00:00:45,509 --> 00:00:51,808
which will tax and regulate the sales of

17
00:00:48,058 --> 00:00:53,519
marijuana to adults and allow medicinal

18
00:00:51,808 --> 00:00:56,759
marijuana and completely legalized

19
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:59,609
industrial hemp it's true that's as our

20
00:00:56,759 --> 00:01:00,960
tagline begin the show says this is the

21
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:03,600
truth we're here to tell you the truth

22
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,129
and our petition is about telling the

23
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,129
truth and getting the truth back out

24
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:10,770
there which is why we would call our

25
00:01:07,129 --> 00:01:12,539
political action camp committee to

26
00:01:10,769 --> 00:01:15,199
restore hemp we want to restore hemp to

27
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:18,479
its rightful place to its truthful place

28
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:20,879
yeah him produces more fiber protein and

29
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:23,789
oil than any other plant on this planet

30
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:25,978
and our petition would allow Oregon

31
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:29,040
farmers to cultivate this valuable crop

32
00:01:25,978 --> 00:01:33,810
and allow Oregon industries to develop

33
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:37,110
sustainable products and practices yeah

34
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:39,060
the entire crop will be purchased by the

35
00:01:37,109 --> 00:01:43,289
Oregon Liquor Control Commission and

36
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:47,430
then be sold to state-run stores and

37
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:49,530
packaged that way for for use but part

38
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:51,689
of that also would they would package it

39
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:54,450
to pharmacies and control it for

40
00:01:51,688 --> 00:01:55,019
pharmacies and so we would work that way

41
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:57,269
with it

42
00:01:55,019 --> 00:02:01,468
which would help patients who need it

43
00:01:57,269 --> 00:02:04,798
for medical purposes yes it would also

44
00:02:01,468 --> 00:02:06,419
allow doctors to prescribe it through

45
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:10,439
those pharmacies and that wouldn't be

46
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:12,390
taxed the marijuana in pharmacies would

47
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:12,939
be sold at cost so it'd be very an

48
00:02:12,389 --> 00:02:15,219
expense

49
00:02:12,939 --> 00:02:17,770
the sales to adults through the state

50
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:20,560
liquor store system we would have a tax

51
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:23,530
on the sales of the product to adults

52
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:27,699
and that and through any bars or public

53
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:30,159
houses that wanted to add marijuana as

54
00:02:27,699 --> 00:02:31,750
something as long as they bar minors

55
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:34,180
from entering and they have a license

56
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:36,039
they could be supplied by the olcc

57
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:38,560
we actually change the name of the olcc

58
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:40,000
to the oregon intoxicant Control

59
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,800
Commission rather the Oregon Liquor

60
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,289
Control Commission because we'll be

61
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:47,320
including cannabis in there Everywhere's

62
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:48,370
and and it would make more sense anyways

63
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:51,840
because the Oregon Liquor Control

64
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:56,530
Commission right now does deal with

65
00:02:51,840 --> 00:03:00,009
certain medical drugs and it packages

66
00:02:56,530 --> 00:03:02,979
liquor as medicine for some people and

67
00:03:00,009 --> 00:03:04,899
so then also what we're we really want

68
00:03:02,979 --> 00:03:06,729
to point out is that this does allow

69
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:10,480
this question always comes up it does

70
00:03:06,729 --> 00:03:12,819
allow people to grow at home because if

71
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:14,789
we don't we classify seeds and starts as

72
00:03:12,819 --> 00:03:17,889
hemp and hemp

73
00:03:14,789 --> 00:03:20,859
not regulated by this initiative you

74
00:03:17,889 --> 00:03:24,609
allowed to grow hemp so as in the

75
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:26,590
Netherlands today the cultivation of

76
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:30,880
marijuana for personal use and the sales

77
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:34,959
of seeds and small plants and starts or

78
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:36,519
cuttings would be legalized and so you

79
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:39,069
wouldn't be mandated to go through the

80
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:41,770
state system but since most people who

81
00:03:39,069 --> 00:03:44,560
grew smoke tobacco don't grow their own

82
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:46,090
tobacco we would guess that the there

83
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,949
would still be a pretty open market

84
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:50,890
through the liquor store system and

85
00:03:47,949 --> 00:03:52,238
local taverns and public houses but

86
00:03:50,889 --> 00:03:54,669
definitely cuz not everybody has a green

87
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:56,500
thumb let's face it and not everybody

88
00:03:54,669 --> 00:03:59,530
wants to take responsibility of watering

89
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:00,939
a plant on you know on a weekly basis or

90
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:02,439
whatever and and have them to worry

91
00:04:00,939 --> 00:04:05,409
about it's um you just want to pop down

92
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:07,719
in the local store and buy some or go

93
00:04:05,409 --> 00:04:10,689
into the local public house and enjoy a

94
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:12,099
little bit with their friends and so

95
00:04:10,689 --> 00:04:15,039
that's what this is all about it is

96
00:04:12,099 --> 00:04:17,529
basically restoring freedom and freedom

97
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:20,079
of choice and one thing I want to make

98
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:23,250
clear up front is surely you know I can

99
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:25,620
see public houses open up after this

100
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:28,350
initiative passes but

101
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:30,240
it's still illegal under this to drive

102
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:33,060
under the influence under the influence

103
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,560
of anything is still illegal so we're

104
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:37,199
gonna make that perfectly clear to start

105
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:40,319
off with but and I'm real happy that

106
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:43,620
this does cover the medical purposes for

107
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:46,228
marijuana a lot of people out there use

108
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:48,149
marijuana on a daily basis some some

109
00:04:46,228 --> 00:04:49,949
people use on a weekly basis when the

110
00:04:48,149 --> 00:04:52,859
need strikes but they do need marijuana

111
00:04:49,949 --> 00:04:55,199
for a medical purpose and this addresses

112
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:57,870
that this takes them out of the black

113
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:00,660
market out of the hands of the common

114
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:02,879
criminals out of their hands of trying

115
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:04,970
to grow it for themselves and says okay

116
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:08,639
wording you know treat like a regular

117
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:10,740
herb a pharmaceutical herb exactly it

118
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,720
would allow the sale through pharmacies

119
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:16,400
and so people would be certain that

120
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:20,220
they're getting medicinal quality

121
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:21,478
marijuana through pharmacies so we're

122
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:25,020
doing that through a petition process

123
00:05:21,478 --> 00:05:26,939
and right now we have closing in on

124
00:05:25,019 --> 00:05:28,978
about two almost twenty thousand

125
00:05:26,939 --> 00:05:30,930
signatures we need to turn in about a

126
00:05:28,978 --> 00:05:32,909
hundred thousand signatures because we

127
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:36,120

196
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:30,009
dying Densmore who probably ought to

197
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:32,490
have heard of today was a victim of

198
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:34,990
marijuana task force she ran the

199
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:37,539
cannabis buyers club a local version of

200
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:41,639
it here which helped out people here who

201
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:45,309
who needed as their the drug of of

202
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:46,990
missile need and this will help and but

203
00:08:45,309 --> 00:08:49,029
she can't be here because she's

204
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:50,649
suffering from some medical problems

205
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:51,870
right now do the fact that the police

206
00:08:50,649 --> 00:08:53,879
have harassed her

207
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:57,149
she can't get access yeah actually I

208
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:59,519
talked to her this evening and she was a

209
00:08:57,149 --> 00:09:03,360
person who was running the alternative

210
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:05,699
health clinic here in Portland and was

211
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,680
busted I guess it was in late September

212
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:10,050
initially and they came back in late

213
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:13,139
October and busted her again and took

214
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:14,969
her to jail for over a week they held

215
00:09:13,139 --> 00:09:18,240
her in there and I'm sure most of you

216
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:20,399
feel a lot safer because this lady died

217
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:24,389
and Densmore was locked up but she is

218
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:27,240
now having to take a urinalysis test at

219
00:09:24,389 --> 00:09:29,120
least once a week call in daily seven

220
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:32,820
days a week down to the Multnomah County

221
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:37,230
Jail and their supervisors and report

222
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:42,290
periodically to them upon demand and to

223
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:44,610
undergo your analysis testing and

224
00:09:42,289 --> 00:09:46,740
because that she can't use her medicine

225
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:51,600
and she's doing really really poorly she

226
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:53,789
says her cardiac problems are starting

227
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,070
to increase and she's got a number of

228
00:09:53,789 --> 00:09:57,899
other medical problems and then she's

229
00:09:56,070 --> 00:10:00,000
under an incredible amount of stress and

230
00:09:57,899 --> 00:10:03,088
she misses her friends the people she

231
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,580
used to work with in the the club she

232
00:10:03,089 --> 00:10:07,500
really said she she was missing some of

233
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:09,120
those folks so if you want to get in

234
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:11,250

235
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,230

237
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:19,110
three five four six zero six

238
00:10:15,769 --> 00:10:22,980
she couldn't make it tonight hopefully

239
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:26,839
she'll be back with us in mid to late

240
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:28,830
January when we tape again so she'll be

241
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:30,779
hopefully she'll be feeling a little bit

242
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:33,209
better and you give us a report directly

243
00:10:30,778 --> 00:10:35,700
yeah it's just really shame that the

244
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:39,449
police had to spend all of our tax

245
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:42,509
dollars on this you know there's a they

246
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:45,330
had a multi most surveillance on the

247
00:10:42,509 --> 00:10:49,110
internal health center they sent in

248
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:51,240
undercover police numerous times they

249
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:54,269
sent in informa descend street and

250
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:56,339
forming in and the thing is that you

251
00:10:54,269 --> 00:10:59,039
know they had a real doctor write up

252
00:10:56,339 --> 00:11:01,410
real notes and we don't know why this

253
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:03,838
doctor did this whether this doctor was

254
00:11:01,409 --> 00:11:04,879
was pressured because he was under some

255
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,619
sort of

256
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:10,350
suspicions himself or some sort of crime

257
00:11:07,619 --> 00:11:11,970
or whether the doctor is the drug

258
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:14,550
warrior and while I take pardon and if

259
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:17,040
that's the case then he's writing you

260
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:20,039
know false notes in which he's reported

261
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:21,509
to the state licensing board of medicine

262
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:24,118
the figure out why this guy's writing

263
00:11:21,509 --> 00:11:26,818
phony prescriptions for non-existent

264
00:11:24,119 --> 00:11:30,678
alum elements there's a lot of questions

265
00:11:26,818 --> 00:11:33,149
there that haven't been answered by the

266
00:11:30,678 --> 00:11:35,548
local police department or the local

267
00:11:33,149 --> 00:11:37,948
district attorney and so I would suggest

268
00:11:35,548 --> 00:11:40,169

269
00:11:37,948 --> 00:11:42,208

275
00:11:52,139 --> 00:11:56,039
Dinsmore and others it's not just her

276
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:59,100
there's other people as well that were

277
00:11:56,039 --> 00:12:01,919
arrested you know from this whole fall

278
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:04,439
out at this marijuana task force it's

279
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:07,289
just a travesty yeah yeah they they

280
00:12:04,438 --> 00:12:10,708
arrested some of the people who were

281
00:12:07,289 --> 00:12:13,230
helping they're volunteering and it's

282
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:15,868
it's a shame that very ill people people

283
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:18,028
who who are dying in fact the

284
00:12:15,869 --> 00:12:20,639
alternative health clinic a few of their

285
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:24,720
patients would be dying every every week

286
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:28,789
or a lot you know people who have cancer

287
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:31,410
and advanced HIV and they found that

288
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:32,639
cannabis helped them cannabis helped the

289
00:12:31,409 --> 00:12:35,368
the cancer patients undergoing

290
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:37,079
chemotherapy restore their appetite

291
00:12:35,369 --> 00:12:38,910
cannabis helped the AIDS patients

292
00:12:37,078 --> 00:12:40,678
restore their appetite that were

293
00:12:38,909 --> 00:12:43,740
suffering from the wasting syndrome

294
00:12:40,678 --> 00:12:46,139
so to go in and arrest the people

295
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:49,428
providing relief to these people to me

296
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:51,600
seems particularly evil and cruel

297
00:12:49,428 --> 00:12:53,850
unfortunately some of the officers

298
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,249
involved when that have questionable

299
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:58,290
ethics in my opinion a lot of officers

300
00:12:56,249 --> 00:13:01,019
though support innovations like the

301
00:12:58,289 --> 00:13:03,298
Oregon cannabis Tax Act and they want to

302
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:06,948
make certain that they don't have to go

303
00:13:03,298 --> 00:13:10,769
out and arrest nonviolent family raising

304
00:13:06,948 --> 00:13:13,558
adults using marijuana and the privacy

305
00:13:10,769 --> 00:13:15,659
of their home so a lot of times we have

306
00:13:13,558 --> 00:13:17,899

no complaints from the public on this

332
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:21,470
this was all police generated the whole

333
00:14:19,309 --> 00:14:23,509
controversy about this there's no the

334
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:24,560
you know the police you know they didn't

335
00:14:23,509 --> 00:14:27,679
say they're getting calls from the

336
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:31,338
public to go out and bust these people

337
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:32,509
people all had gotten some publicity for

338
00:14:31,339 --> 00:14:34,400
running they'll turn of health center

339
00:14:32,509 --> 00:14:37,490
for providing cannabis for people who

340
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:39,169
desperately needed it as medicine but

341
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:41,450
the police didn't you know they created

342
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:42,769
their own their own crime in a sense it

343
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:46,160
seems to me that they have a political

344
00:14:42,769 --> 00:14:49,759
agenda at least the officers in the drug

345
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:53,299
enforcement units that pursued this case

346
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:55,639
to arrest medical patients because the

347
00:14:53,299 --> 00:14:59,539
District Attorney of Multnomah County

348
00:14:55,639 --> 00:15:01,789
Michael shrunk had said that he wasn't

349
00:14:59,539 --> 00:15:04,429
going to prosecute marijuana cases well

350
00:15:01,789 --> 00:15:07,958
here he is prosecuting a marijuana case

351
00:15:04,429 --> 00:15:11,838
so that's one politician I guess but

352
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:13,879
we'd like to point out that you know

353
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:15,410
some people say that marijuana is

354
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:18,379
medicinally available over-the-counter

355
00:15:15,409 --> 00:15:20,919
because there's a substance called

356
00:15:18,379 --> 00:15:23,179
Marinol that contains one of the

357
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:25,278
psychoactive substances that's in

358
00:15:23,179 --> 00:15:27,500
cannabis contains THC or

359
00:15:25,278 --> 00:15:30,559
tetrahydrocannabinol there are other

360
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:31,710
site non psychoactive and psychoactive

361
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:35,219
substances in mayor

362
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:41,879
Oana that have medicinal properties CBD

363
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:44,450
or cannabidiol is a anti [ __ ] agent

364
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:47,580
that stops multiple sclerosis patients

365
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:49,500
spasms very efficiently if you're

366
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:52,650
undergoing a spasm of with multiple

367
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:54,360
sclerosis you can't swallow a Marinol

368
00:15:52,649 --> 00:15:56,639
pill and wait an hour and a half for it

369
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:59,190
to work just a few hits of marijuana

370
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:02,210
helped multiple sclerosis patients and

371
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:05,970
the British Medical Association just

372
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:07,650
noted that in a survey and an article

373
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:09,240
they had in the British Medical Journal

374
00:16:07,649 --> 00:16:10,620
saying that marijuana should be

375
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:12,899
medicinally available

376
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:16,019
you know the Oregon cannabis Tax Act the

377
00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:18,539
question itself says exactly yes vote

378
00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:20,789
permit state licensed cultivation and

379
00:16:18,539 --> 00:16:24,000
sale of marijuana for medical purposes

380
00:16:20,789 --> 00:16:26,879
and to adults it really stresses the

381
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,070
medical aspects of our initiative

382
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:31,620
because we set up a number of medical

383
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:34,200
studies through the Oregon Health

384
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:35,940
Sciences University and other medical

385
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:38,280
research facilities here in the state of

386
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:41,340
Oregon and all of that's funded through

387
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:44,909
the taxation of the recreational sale of

388
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:48,300
marijuana so our initiative will help

389
00:16:44,909 --> 00:16:51,389
medical patients not only get medicinal

390
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:54,000
marijuana but also access the health

391
00:16:51,389 --> 00:16:57,299
they need yeah it's you stop and think

392
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:00,360
about it you know smoking marijuana is

393
00:16:57,299 --> 00:17:03,059
the best delivery control substance for

394
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:05,279
THC you know much better the pill as you

395
00:17:03,059 --> 00:17:08,129
said that you pill you know you have two

396
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:09,240
difficulty swallowing sometimes the time

397
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:11,100
it takes for it to break down your

398
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:13,529
stomach then they go through the stomach

399
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:16,439
walls with lining into your bloodstream

400
00:17:13,529 --> 00:17:18,470
and then to the muscles that need it or

401
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:21,390
the nerves or wherever it needs to go to

402
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:23,640
versus smoking it's always bad for

403
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:24,870
things in their lungs but that's the

404
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:27,180
only choice you have

405
00:17:24,869 --> 00:17:31,259
in your lungs right away I mean you're

406
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:34,110
it's getting the oxygen and blood mixes

407
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:36,750
right away so within minutes you know

408
00:17:34,109 --> 00:17:38,519
it's it's where it needs to go to some

409
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:40,710
of the patients that take Marinol

410
00:17:38,519 --> 00:17:43,170
complained that an hour and a half later

411
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:44,850
they either too stoned that the effects

412
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:47,730
strike too suddenly

413
00:17:44,849 --> 00:17:49,678
and to intensely or they don't get that

414
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:53,308
effect at all and so they really can't

415
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:56,038
get an effective dose very they can't

416
00:17:53,308 --> 00:17:58,259
measure it too well orally no it is the

417
00:17:56,038 --> 00:17:59,269
best love control substance and wanting

418
00:17:58,259 --> 00:18:02,009
it back to a point you made about

419
00:17:59,269 --> 00:18:05,250
Michael Shrunk local da being a

420
00:18:02,009 --> 00:18:06,538
politician and yet is you know and you

421
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:08,910
know I've heard him interviewed on this

422
00:18:06,538 --> 00:18:11,579
talk show where he a talk show here in

423
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:13,710
town and and he basically said that I'm

424
00:18:11,579 --> 00:18:16,168
a politician and right now

425
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:17,579
marijuana is against the law but I mean

426
00:18:16,169 --> 00:18:19,380
you know obviously left it open and if

427
00:18:17,579 --> 00:18:21,689
the law has changed you know he'll be

428
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:23,490
supported michael shrunk is not going to

429
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:25,140
be out in front of the band leading it

430
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:27,390
some people think that Michael shrunk

431
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:28,860
should be and you know his job is a

432
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:31,049
politician and he's not going to be out

433
00:18:28,859 --> 00:18:33,389
in front of the band which is where we

434
00:18:31,048 --> 00:18:36,058
come in we have to lead a band there's

435
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:39,530
you know majority of people here in

436
00:18:36,058 --> 00:18:41,908
Oregon want to have medical marijuana

437
00:18:39,529 --> 00:18:43,710
available and you know we can do that

438
00:18:41,909 --> 00:18:45,360
through this petition and then people

439
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:47,429
like Michael shrunk will just say okay

440
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:50,099
yeah it's there you know this is the

441
00:18:47,429 --> 00:18:53,159
people I've spoken and you know we can

442
00:18:50,099 --> 00:18:56,038
we can do this with this initiative so I

443
00:18:53,159 --> 00:18:59,130
just I like how to say you know Michael

444
00:18:56,038 --> 00:19:00,150
shrunk is a politician and he's being

445
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:02,789
pushed around by the police department

446
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:04,530
here certainly numbers of it yeah you

447
00:19:02,788 --> 00:19:06,750
know I heard a report recently that

448
00:19:04,529 --> 00:19:09,089
Michael Strunk actually admitted that he

449
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:09,630
had a very ill relative up in Washington

450
00:19:09,089 --> 00:19:12,779
State

451
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:16,559
that was undergoing chemotherapy and

452
00:19:12,779 --> 00:19:20,428
that he actually procured and supplied

453
00:19:16,558 --> 00:19:23,579
marijuana to this very ill relative so

454
00:19:20,429 --> 00:19:25,890
now he's his office is in charge of

455
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:28,859
prosecuting a number of very ill people

456
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:31,259
that like his relative needed marijuana

457
00:19:28,859 --> 00:19:32,579
to help save their lives to treat their

458
00:19:31,259 --> 00:19:34,950
some yes I don't know whether that's

459
00:19:32,579 --> 00:19:36,779
true or not but still though I mean it

460
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:38,069
just shows you that if Michael shrunk

461
00:19:36,779 --> 00:19:41,158
was saying earlier he wouldn't prosecute

462
00:19:38,069 --> 00:19:43,918
these but he was presented by the police

463
00:19:41,159 --> 00:19:45,270
department such a high-profile case is

464
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:47,880
where it comes down to this was a very

465
00:19:45,269 --> 00:19:50,339
high-profile case and a deputy da that

466
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:51,539
really well numb once just no but he was

467
00:19:50,339 --> 00:19:52,709
presented to them by the police

468
00:19:51,538 --> 00:19:54,960
department if it would have been just

469
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:56,940
one little person growing and given to a

470
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,140
few others he could have you know had to

471
00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:00,750
fall between the cracks

472
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:03,660
but because the police spent so much

473
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:06,539
time on it so much money so many

474
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:08,640
officers doing this and to you know

475
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:12,960
well-publicized raids I mean both raids

476
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:15,000
were you know Oregonian front page news

477
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,920
I believe and on every channel and and

478
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,529
so so that he had he couldn't just

479
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:21,269
ignore it he had to go ahead and and

480
00:20:19,529 --> 00:20:23,099
prosecute this you know the police

481
00:20:21,269 --> 00:20:25,349
pushed him into it or certain members of

482
00:20:23,099 --> 00:20:29,069
the police certain members of police you

483
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:30,839
know don't don't believe in your rice

484
00:20:29,069 --> 00:20:34,200
that's what I've got is you know that's

485
00:20:30,839 --> 00:20:35,759
that's the simple sad fact you know most

486
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,710
police officers do believe in your

487
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:39,990
rights but some don't and they're the

488
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:43,350
ones that are you know pushing you're on

489
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:45,240
a DA's office sadly so another ass thing

490
00:20:43,349 --> 00:20:47,099
that the our ballot title says

491
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:49,980
specifically on the medical issue is

492
00:20:47,099 --> 00:20:52,678
that Commission will sell marijuana at

493
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:56,429
cost to pharmacies and medical research

494
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:58,530
facilities for medical purposes we need

495
00:20:56,429 --> 00:21:01,559
your help that's why we're here is to

00:21:25,829 --> 00:21:29,668
put this in about well you know that's

506
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:32,849
that's important that the Commission

507
00:21:29,669 --> 00:21:36,419
will sell this medical cannabis to

508
00:21:32,849 --> 00:21:37,769
license research facilities because one

509
00:21:36,419 --> 00:21:39,780
of the first things that Ronald Reagan

510
00:21:37,769 --> 00:21:42,808
did when he came into office he cut off

511
00:21:39,779 --> 00:21:45,889
all funding for research for cannabis

512
00:21:42,808 --> 00:21:49,319
and as we all know that researchers are

513
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:52,020
dependent upon funding usually federal

514
00:21:49,319 --> 00:21:53,939
for their research especially in medical

515
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:55,950
and if you don't do research you don't

516
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:57,360
keep your job as a professor at a

517
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:59,340
university or you don't get tenure to

518
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:00,629
keep your job and then you got you got

519
00:21:59,339 --> 00:22:03,418
to keep doing your research and keep

520
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:04,980
publishing papers and what soon as soon

521
00:22:03,419 --> 00:22:07,140
as Ronald Reagan cut off the federal

522
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:09,419
funding for cannabis you know every

523
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:11,049
researcher just dropped it yeah and if

524
00:22:09,419 --> 00:22:13,869
we can present

525
00:22:11,048 --> 00:22:16,148
to them at a reasonable cost medical

526
00:22:13,868 --> 00:22:18,519
marijuana cannabis there'll be a lot

527
00:22:16,148 --> 00:22:20,798
more researchers back into the subject

528
00:22:18,519 --> 00:22:25,359
here yeah also they they cut off the

529
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:28,960
supply to get legal marijuana for

530
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:30,788
medicinal purposes for a study you have

531
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:34,360
to get permission from NIDA the National

532
00:22:30,788 --> 00:22:36,638
Institute of drug abuse and NIDA hasn't

533
00:22:34,359 --> 00:22:40,089
granted permission there's one study

534
00:22:36,638 --> 00:22:41,979
that was going to go forward done at the

535
00:22:40,089 --> 00:22:44,648
University of California at San

536
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:48,849
Francisco Medical School and they wanted

537
00:22:44,648 --> 00:22:52,689
to study the effects of marijuana on HIV

538
00:22:48,849 --> 00:22:56,829
infected patients and the dr. Abrams

539
00:22:52,690 --> 00:23:00,669
there Donald Abrams sought permission to

540
00:22:56,829 --> 00:23:03,278
receive legal medical marijuana and his

541
00:23:00,669 --> 00:23:05,859
study was funded all through but NIDA

542
00:23:03,278 --> 00:23:08,888
and approved that a number of different

543
00:23:05,858 --> 00:23:12,428
levels but NIDA denied access to medical

544
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:13,988
marijuana yeah yes it's difficult for

545
00:23:12,429 --> 00:23:15,970
these researchers not only to get

546
00:23:13,989 --> 00:23:18,369
funding but they can't even get the

547
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:20,710
substance from that's why I said so I

548
00:23:18,368 --> 00:23:22,988
said that this one here because we'll

549
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:25,509
we'll provide it to license research

550
00:23:22,989 --> 00:23:28,090
facilities at cost I mean it's gonna

551
00:23:25,509 --> 00:23:30,249
open up a boom in research for this yeah

552
00:23:28,089 --> 00:23:32,108
and a number of states allowed medical

553
00:23:30,249 --> 00:23:37,749
marijuana but they never provided a

554
00:23:32,108 --> 00:23:40,480
method to supply medical patients in

555
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:42,389
fact 36 states including Oregon had

556
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:46,089
medical marijuana at one time or another

557
00:23:42,388 --> 00:23:50,138
over I think it's 26 now have medical

558
00:23:46,089 --> 00:23:52,509
marijuana today legally allowed but only

559
00:23:50,138 --> 00:23:54,459
in California are they allowing patients

560
00:23:52,509 --> 00:23:56,669
to cultivate their own and that's the

561
00:23:54,460 --> 00:24:00,879
only place where there really is a

562
00:23:56,669 --> 00:24:03,489
system of delivery for patients you know

563
00:24:00,878 --> 00:24:05,589
and of course though every every

564
00:24:03,489 --> 00:24:07,269
researcher who's actually studied us has

565
00:24:05,589 --> 00:24:09,278
said that basically there's enough

566
00:24:07,269 --> 00:24:14,429
research out there already that says

567
00:24:09,278 --> 00:24:15,960
that cannabis does work for a number of

568
00:24:14,429 --> 00:24:18,399
illnesses

569
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:21,819
where'd want to call it a problem for

570
00:24:18,398 --> 00:24:23,229
the human body we all we know that you

571
00:24:21,819 --> 00:24:24,579
know that every time they do a research

572
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:27,159
they just go ahead and catwalk

573
00:24:24,579 --> 00:24:29,019
all the past studies and they're doing

574
00:24:27,159 --> 00:24:30,580
it again yep they're doing another the

575
00:24:29,019 --> 00:24:32,470
fellows constitute of Medicine have the

576
00:24:30,579 --> 00:24:34,740
National Science Foundation is just

577
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:37,450
doing another one at the behest of the

578
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:39,220
federal drug czar yeah that was the

579
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:41,440
passage of the bills in California

580
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:42,640
California Arizona they wanted you know

581
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,110
come up with another one because they

582
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,120
were pressured into it they were denying

583
00:24:44,109 --> 00:24:47,769
it and so now they can say well actually

584
00:24:46,119 --> 00:24:49,719
we're doing something where we're

585
00:24:47,769 --> 00:24:51,940
cataloging all the past research they're

586
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:53,620
not doing new research no they're doing

587
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:57,070
a few forums around the country one of

588
00:24:53,619 --> 00:24:59,408
them in Los Angeles New Orleans and a

589
00:24:57,069 --> 00:25:01,720
final one in Washington DC where they're

590
00:24:59,409 --> 00:25:04,028
allowing all sorts of public input a

591
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:06,179
couple of the researchers actually are

592
00:25:04,028 --> 00:25:09,819
from Oregon Health Sciences University

593
00:25:06,179 --> 00:25:11,440
there are only five researchers involved

594
00:25:09,819 --> 00:25:13,359
on the project and two of them are from

595
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:17,350
right here in Portland at the Oregon

596
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:20,109
Health Sciences University but you know

597
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:24,278
our initiative is what we hope is going

598
00:25:20,109 --> 00:25:26,979
to allow patients to legally get medical

599
00:25:24,278 --> 00:25:28,929
marijuana through pharmacies and I think

600
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:30,669
that's a big breakthrough for them yeah

601
00:25:28,929 --> 00:25:33,580
and it is going to be a big breakthrough

602
00:25:30,669 --> 00:25:36,519
for the patients you know so many people

603
00:25:33,579 --> 00:25:38,168
you know you know this the idea that

604
00:25:36,519 --> 00:25:39,940
they can just go to local pharmacy and

605
00:25:38,169 --> 00:25:41,860
get it with their prescription so much

606
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:44,200
better than I stated earlier and then

607
00:25:41,859 --> 00:25:48,398
trying to find some local dealer that

608
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:50,500
has some you know and hoping that it's

609
00:25:48,398 --> 00:25:51,969
that it's good clean stuff because you

610
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:54,940
never know what's going out no

611
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:56,649
pesticides or who knows what and there

612
00:25:54,940 --> 00:26:00,038
was what they spray on the stuff to you

613
00:25:56,648 --> 00:26:02,229
know make it seem better but just that

614
00:26:00,038 --> 00:26:04,419
simple you know in their mind they know

615
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:07,538
that it's safe I mean it's it's just so

616
00:26:04,419 --> 00:26:10,929
much better it's just a travesty you

617
00:26:07,538 --> 00:26:12,638
know that we don't allow this medicine I

618
00:26:10,929 --> 00:26:14,860
mean right well I should the government

619
00:26:12,638 --> 00:26:16,298
tell you what is medicine what isn't

620
00:26:14,859 --> 00:26:20,229
medicine you know we're all adults

621
00:26:16,298 --> 00:26:22,359
enough to make up our own minds so get

622
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:25,389
our petition that's the solution that we

623
00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:27,490
keep working at here and we urge you to

624
00:26:25,388 --> 00:26:30,490
call us and get these things at two

625
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:33,250
three five four six zero six I hate to

626
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:36,490
be redundant but we do need your help

627
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:38,440
without your help we we might not make

628
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:42,490
it we need everyone's help

629
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:46,808

631
00:26:46,808 --> 00:26:51,069
of these and get helpless get some

632
00:26:49,569 --> 00:26:52,960

we'll be happy to send you one if you

634
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:57,700
just want one and help us put this on

635
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:59,409
the ballot yeah cuz I'm sure you know

636
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:01,509
most you out there watching us you know

637
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:05,559
have known as somebody personally who

638
00:27:01,509 --> 00:27:07,028
has been helped by medical cannabis you

639
00:27:05,558 --> 00:27:09,638
know it's some way or somebody with

640
00:27:07,028 --> 00:27:12,909
multiple sclerosis or chemotherapy or

641
00:27:09,638 --> 00:27:15,069
you know wasting syndrome you mean you

642
00:27:12,909 --> 00:27:17,710
know it or just you know horrible pains

643
00:27:15,069 --> 00:27:19,028
from all the chemical exposures people

644
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:20,829
that's a new one coming up with these

645
00:27:19,028 --> 00:27:23,319
chemical toxic exposures people have

646
00:27:20,829 --> 00:27:26,888
that cannabis helps that relieve that

647
00:27:23,319 --> 00:27:30,460
total oliver body pain morning sickness

648
00:27:26,888 --> 00:27:32,469
yeah and menstrual cramps cannabis was

649
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:35,590
actually prescribed back to Queen

650
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:37,210
Victoria over a hundred years ago for

651
00:27:35,589 --> 00:27:41,798
menstrual cramps and was used for that

652
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:44,169
for many many years so met right now

653
00:27:41,798 --> 00:27:47,679
marijuana isn't allowed for morning

654
00:27:44,169 --> 00:27:49,809
sickness and menstrual cramps and in the

655
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:53,200
areas where it has been studied in

656
00:27:49,808 --> 00:27:54,970
conjunction with pregnancy and women's

657
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:57,629
health issues they found that is

658
00:27:54,970 --> 00:28:02,200
increased the birth weight of babies and

659
00:27:57,628 --> 00:28:05,408
