1
00:00:04,719 --> 00:00:07,199
right now

2
00:00:05,919 --> 00:00:10,638
the government is spending much more

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:13,839
money crushing the production of hemp

4
00:00:10,638 --> 00:00:14,959
and another thing that puzzles me

5
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:17,519
about the

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,560
insanity or the even the diabolical

7
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:20,559
nature

8
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:23,118
of the right wing religious republican

9
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:23,118
situation

10
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:28,160
why do they go after the american

11
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,320
farmers

12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,480
they spend more money fighting hemp in

13
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,640
this country you know in california

14
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:37,119
which is my home state uh

15
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,439
hemp was the number one agricultural

16
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:41,439
cash product in iowa in tennessee and

17
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:43,920
like back in indiana where i'm from how

18
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:46,320
many states uh at least that we're aware

19
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,640
of 28 or more yeah honest farmers out

20
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,759
there trying to make a living growing up

21
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,480
and the government is out there

22
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:54,479
arresting these good-hearted

23
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:56,319
free enterprise farming agricultural

24
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:59,839
americans meanwhile

25
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:02,719
down in colombia and peru these

26
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,478
gangsters the cocaine uh cartel people

27
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:06,640
are making billions of dollars and if

28
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:08,640
we're spending less money on them i said

29
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,960
how come i think you're probably right

30
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,840
that um

31
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:15,679
they uh they don't want people to be

32
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,719
using hemp do because it would interfere

33
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:22,640
with the oil monopoly it would interfere

34
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:25,039
with the wood pulp monopoly

35
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,799
and also i think

36
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,960
there's something really religiously

37
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,960
diabolic and evil

38
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:32,959
about the right-wing christians in this

39
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:34,879
country who go after him

40
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:36,559
because they hate people to have

41
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:38,640
pro-choice and to make your own

42
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,320
decisions about your life and they seem

43
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,640
to be some of the people too who

44
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:44,719
overlook the medical aspects absolutely

45
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,399
yeah now from your perspective and being

46
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:48,798
being a psychiatrist as you are you've

47
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,159
had the opportunity to become acquainted

48
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,399
with

49
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,920
many different aspects of healing and

50
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:55,920
some of the some of the more positive

51
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,640
benefits of the uses of ham could you

52
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,719
share that please

53
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,640
well there have been an enormous number

54
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:04,959
of studies that show that

55
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,519
that hemp and cannabis

56
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:09,118
is uh was extremely necessary for

57
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:10,719
certain forms of glaucoma you simply

58
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:11,520
have to have it

59
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:12,959
there

60
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,239
in many states

61
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:18,159
these fanatic anti-pleasure people are

62
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:21,039
so afraid that the patient who's going

63
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:23,199
blind might enjoy the experience that

64
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:24,799
you got to go blind you can die but

65
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:26,560
don't have a good time because the

66
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,319
republicans are in power that's

67
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,318
apparently the logic here are they using

68
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:32,560
it too for anorexia and for cancer

69
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:34,000
exactly aids i mean there's one terrible

70
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,840
thing about hemp and i don't want to get

71
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,680
into the uh you know the use of

72
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,560
marijuana but i got to be honest with

73
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,719
you

74
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:44,719
there are some terrible side effects of

75
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:44,719
smoking or using marijuana one is

76
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:49,199
it's called refrigerator blackout when

77
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:50,639
you get the munchies oh okay you know

78
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:51,839
you suddenly you smoke a joint and

79
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:53,679
suddenly you're there you are the next

80
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,439
thing you know you've eaten uh

81
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,519
nine pounds of fig newton and say that

82
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:59,359
now that's that's dangerous you got it

83
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,200
you gotta be careful there uh

84
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,000
on the other hand if you're dying of

85
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:05,759
cancer or uh malnu nourish because of

86
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,479
stomach problems and you don't have any

87
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:09,840
appetite hemp of course is the illogical

88
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:12,318
and obvious

89
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,080
and natural medicine to give you an

90
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:15,759
appetite to see you through that period

91
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,159
but again

92
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:20,000
a good true puritan we'd rather have you

93
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:21,919
die

94
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,680
now we all have a good meal while you're

95
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:25,039
giggling

96
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,040
we also know

97
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:29,359
that it's good for stress to calm you

98
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:32,400
down and from a viewpoint of a

99
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,599
psychiatrist is there any benefits

100
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,439
for someone who might be having

101
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:37,919
emotional or mental problems as opposed

102
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:40,000
to giving them like

103
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:41,280
valiums or some of these other stronger

104
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,039
drugs that seem to be causing problems

105
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,840
like prozac and so on

106
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:45,199
yeah

107
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,640
well number one i don't want to come out

108
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:48,399
like a smart

109
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:49,679
smart ass here and

110
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,080
every

111
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,319
psychological situation is individual

112
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,239
and needs its own uh you know it's on

113
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:57,839
pharma pharmacology so i want to

114
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,959
generalize

115
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:03,039
but certainly uh the things about hemp

116
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,120
is it's not addictive

117
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:07,598
it's extremely uh harm doesn't have any

118
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,360
of the side effects of uh many of the

119
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:11,280
euphorics

120
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,560
and the antidepressants

121
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,560
that are approved

122
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,680
and the doctor's prescriptions will give

123
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,399
you so uh

124
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,400
yeah there's a

125
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:22,399
you see the thing about religious

126
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:25,519
fanaticism is

127
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:26,799
that the crazier the nuttier the wilder

128
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:28,639
and almost the

129
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,639
more nonsensical the belief to already

130
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,800
hang on to it so that uh

131
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,960
i've debated for many years a man who

132
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,680
was the head of the dea for about five

133
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:40,560
years name is peter benson yeah she has

134
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,879
and i can't believe him he's going after

135
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,918
him but he's trying to say that

136
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:46,079
oh

137
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:48,319
him

138
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:50,959
they gave a lot of some some mice some

139
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:53,439
hemp and it made male mice

140
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:55,359
teenage male mice and it made their

141
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:57,759
breasts grow a little so he's like few

142
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:00,000
college boys he's even going to i think

143
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:02,720
why is he going the real problems of

144
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,560
crack babies and the inner city and uh

145
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,360
alcohol which was our number one drug

146
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,038
here

147
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,960
and uh nicotine

148
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:11,038
half a million people die here from that

149
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:12,079
here's this guy's blathering on about

150
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:14,159
the

151
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:15,599
dangers of uh

152
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,280
of uh

153
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,360
i don't know he never did mention

154
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:21,359
whether uh whether

155
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,560
marijuana would make girls breast

156
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,240
breaker but i don't want to get into

157
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,319
that the whole thing is now you've also

158
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,918
had a few debates with g gordon liddy

159
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:31,199
too yeah that's right

160
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:34,000
and uh he seems to think that uh

161
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,840
marijuana i.e hemp is one of the uh

162
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,399
the plants that's going to lead to a

163
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:40,239
complete social breakdown and our

164
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:42,399
structure of government

165
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,000
and you see well i know gordon liddy uh

166
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:46,719
i've been debating him i've known him

167
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,519
for years over 25 years

168
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,600
i know exactly how his mind works

169
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:53,519
like a good army man

170
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,840
like a good military man

171
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:58,478
