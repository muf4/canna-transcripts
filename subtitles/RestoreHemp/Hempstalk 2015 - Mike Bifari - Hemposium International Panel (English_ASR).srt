1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:08,429
we've been on the front line for

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:11,820
struggling for freedom of the pan and of

3
00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:17,310
the consumers of cannabis since maybe

4
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:19,109
like 17 years now and it would it was

5
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:25,140
nothing there we kind of built

6
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:28,618
everything from zero with no money this

7
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:31,380
is actually what we did and I won't just

8
00:00:28,618 --> 00:00:33,600
give a brief little update about what's

9
00:00:31,379 --> 00:00:36,000
really going on in South America you

10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,370
know and this can ever think this big

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,289
contradictions worldwide you know about

12
00:00:38,369 --> 00:00:43,199
that there's also contradictions even

13
00:00:40,289 --> 00:00:47,000
here where you guys are ending

14
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:49,859
prohibition right big contradiction

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,350
contradiction that we can't even smoke

16
00:00:49,859 --> 00:00:55,948
in the pot even if it's legal huh let's

17
00:00:52,350 --> 00:01:00,960
see so that's one so um let's go for

18
00:00:55,948 --> 00:01:04,259
South America like Chile this year the

19
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:07,500
authorized destroying for medical

20
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:11,430
patients for 500 plants that this was

21
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:14,150
made by a foundation called aya and the

22
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:18,630
government of one of the counties of

23
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:21,478
santiago chile and after that they are

24
00:01:18,629 --> 00:01:24,000
continuing to discuss the commission's

25
00:01:21,478 --> 00:01:25,590
in Congress the change of the law a lot

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,540
number twenty dollars and that's the

27
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:31,618
name of the law and they're changing it

28
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:35,280
for authorizing six plants per residents

29
00:01:31,618 --> 00:01:37,590
and about half kilo of dry pots in each

30
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,960
property that's what they're discussing

31
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:42,150
now but it's not done yet there's

32
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:45,149
they're they're trying to finish it but

33
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:47,130
it's not done this isn't cheating they

34
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:50,930
have a great community I would break

35
00:01:47,129 --> 00:01:54,060
cannabis community in cheated they make

36
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:57,390
like every year they make the expo weed

37
00:01:54,060 --> 00:02:01,890
which is a three-day event and the last

38
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:04,769
one they had around 70,000 70,000

39
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:06,930
personas attendee for the three-day

40
00:02:04,769 --> 00:02:08,019
event they also have the global

41
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:11,050
marijuana march

42
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:14,770
which is we have here on my right mr.

43
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:17,830
dana p 0 which is they responsible for

44
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:21,100
that if you want passport and past five

45
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:24,820
years and making the march so

46
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:27,750
successfully so this marching sun devil

47
00:02:24,819 --> 00:02:32,079
gather around more than that about

48
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:35,430
300,000 personas this year in May and in

49
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:40,380
Argentina the same March gather around

50
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:46,390
200,000 so huge huge massive event

51
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:49,599
people that they absolutely feel better

52
00:02:46,389 --> 00:02:52,119
by consuming this herb but there's

53
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:54,789
there's not much culture about it I mean

54
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:57,580
people want freedom but they don't know

55
00:02:54,789 --> 00:03:00,729
the history they don't know all the uses

56
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:04,600
of hemp so we're in the in the process

57
00:03:00,729 --> 00:03:08,139
of educating all these massive amounts

58
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:11,409
of people that are waiting for the

59
00:03:08,139 --> 00:03:13,779
hell's freedom but we're lack of culture

60
00:03:11,409 --> 00:03:17,699
yet we have to go through a big process

61
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:21,580
of Education and that's what we're doing

62
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:24,789
alright well let me go get to uh yeah

63
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:29,560
Gaston just just I wanted to finish with

64
00:03:24,789 --> 00:03:31,599
this that here and you know we've been

65
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:34,120
we've been here in America for a few

66
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:39,189
weeks now and we've been observing

67
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:43,200
what's going on and I want to salute how

68
00:03:39,189 --> 00:03:47,229
to say congratulate all the hard-working

69
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:50,679
activists that have made this ending a

70
00:03:47,229 --> 00:03:52,840
provisional reality but I the messages

71
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:55,090
that were not done yet we have to keep

72
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:59,620
on continuing with the rest of America

73
00:03:55,090 --> 00:04:02,229
to liberate the rest of America of three

74
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:05,650
thoughts concerning the pant because

75
00:04:02,229 --> 00:04:07,090
what you guys do here is very important

76
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:08,980
for the rest of the world maybe you're

77
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:11,439
not really cautious about that but

78
00:04:08,979 --> 00:04:16,358
whatever happens here has a big impact

79
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:17,819
worldwide so I was here last year one

80
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:20,729
you guys were with

81
00:04:17,819 --> 00:04:22,139
91 and you succeeded so I want to

82
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:24,360
congratulate all the hard-working

83
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:26,579
activists and tell them that they will

84
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,850
thank you for the hard work but we're

85
00:04:26,579 --> 00:04:31,289
not done yet we have to continue and

86
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:34,650
spreading the word thank you thank you

87
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:36,720
so much so we don't have actually

88
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:41,429
there's no help in South America only

89
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:45,960
other white a project of just a research

90
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:49,560
project we used to have a head but we

91
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:52,169
don't have it anymore and what I want to

92
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:54,060
say about about this new era that's

93
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:55,530
coming that I've seen here also the

94
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:58,730
United States you know part of the

95
00:04:55,529 --> 00:05:02,009
contradictions is we should take the

96
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:04,770
human barriers that make these limits of

97
00:05:02,009 --> 00:05:07,490
THC in hip we should just move them away

98
00:05:04,769 --> 00:05:09,930
that's part of that task that is already

99
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:14,150
we have to keep on doing that because

100
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:16,560
that those those were part of a

101
00:05:14,149 --> 00:05:18,569
different a different time a time of

102
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,610
prohibition now it's a different time

103
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:24,719
and we should go forward and taking

104
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:27,240
those artificial barriers and leave the

105
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,840
plant grow as it is naturally and take

106
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:33,120
all the benefits of it tell us what you

107
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:35,129
know um I represent I've been

108
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:39,030
representing the growers a lot because

109
00:05:35,129 --> 00:05:41,219
we have a homegrown movement but you

110
00:05:39,029 --> 00:05:43,289
know what i want to say is that that's

111
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:47,670
not really important because that's not

112
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:49,920
safe access for all of us we got to go

113
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:53,400
forward in trying to find a different

114
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:55,790
way of getting access besides the whole

115
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:55,789
goal

116
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:01,910
I think you guys are a big example for

117
00:05:59,389 --> 00:06:05,060
the rest of the world I think many of us

118
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:07,160
are going to be inspired by Oregon and

119
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:09,410
by United States in general but Oregon i

120
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:13,630
think that article law is really good

121
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:16,490
and you guys have been following the

122
00:06:13,629 --> 00:06:19,899
information right all the the money has

123
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:19,900
been that's right
