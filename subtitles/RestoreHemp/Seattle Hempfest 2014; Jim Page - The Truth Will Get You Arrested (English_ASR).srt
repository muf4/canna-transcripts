2
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:19,519
doing he held that truth like a fist

3
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:23,359
full of lightning

4
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:23,358
put it out in the world and he let it go

5
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:31,118
and it went viral out in the cyber space

6
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:31,118
until nobody could say that they didn't

7

8
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:48,719

11
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:57,079
in the helicopter

12
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:57,079
has it hovered over here

13
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:01,599
should have seen the figures on the

14
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:04,719
ground looking run for cover tangled in

15
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,719
the wounded and dead

16
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:12,439
it wasn't like they said it was gonna be

17
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:12,438
there were no heroes in the white house

18
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:17,279
and those people on the ground they

19
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:21,200
weren't even soldiers they were

20
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,200
civilians what do you think about

21
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:27,000
that what you don't know

22
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,799
it came for bradley manning

23
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,840
put him in a little white room where the

24
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,840
light was always on

25
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,159
and then locked the door behind him he

26
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:54,519
said we're going to give you justice

27
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,520
until the justice is all gone

28
00:02:07,118 --> 00:02:11,080
trooper get you arrested

29
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,840
secrets on the field around the big

30
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:30,000
machine

31
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:31,920
the secrets of the poison over history

32
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,239
secrets are a power that a lot could be

33
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:34,238
seen

34
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:40,719
behind mystery

35
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:43,840
that what you don't know can kill you

36
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:43,840
the truth will get you

37
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:52,400
and what you don't know can kill you

38
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,400
the truth will get you arrested

39
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:57,679
they say that history is written by the

40
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:00,080
victims who define it and then they nail

41
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,080
it down

42
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:06,719
the other history of the wheel

43
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:06,719
and wheels spin around

44
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,719
you can't hide away forever you know

45
00:03:10,878 --> 00:03:14,719
sooner or later somebody's gonna see

46
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:22,639
and chelsea manning with a whistle

47
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,640
and that makes her a hero to me

48
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:30,039
now what you don't know can kill you

49
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:43,598
get you arrested

50
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:47,839
get you arrested
