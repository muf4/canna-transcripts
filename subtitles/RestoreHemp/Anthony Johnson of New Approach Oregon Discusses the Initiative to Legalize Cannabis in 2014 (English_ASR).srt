treating marijuana use as a crime it

6
00:00:11,798 --> 00:00:17,519
regulates legalizes and tax taxes

7
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:20,359
marijuana uh similar to how we do beer

8
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:23,118
and wine it sets up a wholesaler

9
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:24,760
retailer producer and processor uh

10
00:00:23,118 --> 00:00:26,839
licenses through the Oregon Liquor

11
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:30,118
Control Commission who'll be tasked

12
00:00:26,839 --> 00:00:34,359
making sure that uh only adults over the

13
00:00:30,118 --> 00:00:36,840
age of 21 are utilizing cannabis and

14
00:00:34,359 --> 00:00:39,238
will be responsible for responsible for

15
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:43,800
collecting the taxes that are generated

16
00:00:39,238 --> 00:00:46,479
which are $35 per ounce for flow $10 per

17
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:49,759
ounce of leaf and $5 for every marijuana

18
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:53,358
plant that's sold uh 40% of the revenue

19
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:56,358
generated will go towards education uh

20
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:59,679
35% goes to State and local law

21
00:00:56,359 --> 00:01:02,399
enforcement 20% goes to the uh Oregon

22
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:04,478
Health Authority for uh mental health

23
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:07,200
and substance abuse treatment programs

24
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:10,319
and 5% are allocated towards drug

25
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,680
prevention um there are uh home uh

26
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:15,158
limited home cultivation allowed similar

27
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:17,600
to uh home brewing and making your own

28
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:19,799
wine that's allowed and it clearly

29
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:22,199
protects and explicitly protects the

30
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:23,759
Oregon medical marijuana program uh so

31
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,960
it does not impact the medical marijuana

32
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:28,840
program uh at all so if patients need

33
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:31,118
higher possession limits and the

34
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:32,399
recently licensed and regulated uh

35
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:35,200
facilities through the Oregon Health

36
00:01:32,399 --> 00:01:38,560
Authority are not impacted uh by the new

37
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:41,399
approach Oregon measure and uh finally

38
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,478
um the State Department of Agriculture

39
00:01:41,399 --> 00:01:47,519
is currently not you know has currently

40
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:50,718
had a policy of not um licensing

41
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:52,599
industrial hip Farmers uh but that's

42
00:01:50,718 --> 00:01:54,759
slowly but surely changing the new

43
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:56,478
approach measure just mandates that the

44
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:59,239
State Department of Agriculture cannot

45
00:01:56,478 --> 00:02:02,319
rely upon the federal government to deny

46
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:05,078
Industrial licenses for qualified Oregon

47
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:08,840
farmers so hopefully it'll help uh open

48
00:02:05,078 --> 00:02:10,799
up a new uh market for our farmers who

49
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:13,319
uh aren't allowed to currently possess

50
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,879
industrial hem so in short it'll you

51
00:02:13,318 --> 00:02:17,958
know end the arrest of you know over 10

52
00:02:15,878 --> 00:02:19,919
arrest or citation of more than 10,000

53
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:22,159
oregonians better direct our law

54
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:23,958
enforcement resources regulate marijuana

55
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:26,000
like beer and wine for adults over the

56
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:28,519
age of 21 and generate millions of

57
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,919
dollars of revenue for our state so the

58
00:02:28,519 --> 00:02:34,280
first question we have is is uh with

59
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:36,039
this measure how would taxation work and

60
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:39,719
is there a difference between taxing

61
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:43,199
flowers and processed products like hash

62
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:45,199
oil question of Taxation so under the uh

63
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:48,039
new approach Oregon measure we tax

64
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:50,839
marijuana one time and that's after the

65
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:53,598
first time it's produced and sold um and

66
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:57,519
it's taxed at basically $125 per gram of

67
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:59,919
flour uh $10 per ounce of leaf and $5

68
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:03,680
every plant sold so if you are using

69
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:06,399
using the flowers or Leaf to make

70
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:09,319
edibles oils hash well whatever that may

71
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,959
be uh the marijuana that goes into the

72
00:03:09,318 --> 00:03:13,719
product has already been taxed and

73
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:16,360
there's no additional sales tax no

74
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:18,799
additional taxes beyond that uh we do

75
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:20,400
allow uh vertical integration you don't

76
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:22,040
have to be vertically integrated if you

77
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,439
don't want to we think it's one of the

78
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:26,318
things we've taken uh like the best from

79
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:28,000
Colorado's legalization measure and the

80
00:03:26,318 --> 00:03:31,598
best from Washington's legalization

81
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,400
measure to give Oregon uh you know

82
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:36,000
really small businesses the flexibility

83
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,959
to uh shape their business the way they

84
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,360
see fit in Colorado the marijuana retail

85
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:46,039
stores have to grow 70% of what they

86
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:48,000
sell in Washington uh you cannot grow

87
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:49,878
and sell you can either be a producer or

88
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,840
a retailer so that's led to some of the

89
00:03:49,878 --> 00:03:54,158
supply problems uh they've seen in

90
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,878
Washington in their roll out under the

91
00:03:54,158 --> 00:03:58,598
new approach organ measure if you're a

92
00:03:55,878 --> 00:04:00,399
producer who sells to a retailer then

93
00:03:58,598 --> 00:04:02,560
you'll pay the tax after you sell to the

94
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,959
retailer if you're vertically integrated

95
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,680
to where you're a producer and retailer

96
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,000
you're not actually taxed until after

97
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:11,360
you sell it to the to your customer so

98
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,400
the marijuana's tax the same regardless

99
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,239
of what product it went went into or

100
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:18,239
what you sell it for it's all about the

101
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:18,239
weight
