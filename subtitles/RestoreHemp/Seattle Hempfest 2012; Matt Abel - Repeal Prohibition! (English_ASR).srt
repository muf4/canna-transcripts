1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,960
hey thank you very much really pleased

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:07,798
to be here at Hempfest this is my first

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:09,519
Hempfest and I live in Detroit Michigan

4
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:12,920
and I am here to tell you first of all

5
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:17,039
Michigan has 200,000 medical marijuana

6
00:00:12,919 --> 00:00:18,920
patients registered in less than 4 years

7
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,800
and so things are really happening in

8
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:23,840
Michigan Michigan has reciprocity if you

9
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:26,039
have a medical marijuana card from any

10
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:30,198
other state you're protected under

11
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:32,880
Michigan law up to 2 1/2 o of personal

12
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:35,679
possession and um well if you were

13
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,960
growing 12 plants so I was just telling

14
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:39,280
a story to somebody and when they called

15
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,679
me I said well I should tell this story

16
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,879
on stage it's kind of interesting so I'm

17
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:47,039
in Detroit I've been practicing

18
00:00:43,878 --> 00:00:49,079
marijuana law for 25 years basically but

19
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,320
for the last 10 years I've really been

20
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:53,960
concentrating in it to the point where 5

21
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:55,799
years ago I had a straight marijuana

22
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,558
practice now at that time all the

23
00:00:55,799 --> 00:00:59,959
marijuana law in Michigan was criminal

24
00:00:57,558 --> 00:01:01,959
defense that's all we had unfortunately

25
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:04,799
felonies misdemeanors and by the way do

26
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:09,040
not consent to any searches right don't

27
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:10,880
ever do that so yeah Fourth Amendment so

28
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,520
uh I've been practicing criminal defense

29
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:14,759
law and then all of a sudden we get the

30
00:01:12,519 --> 00:01:16,438
medical marijuana law and I had no idea

31
00:01:14,759 --> 00:01:18,200
that was going to happen in Michigan but

32
00:01:16,438 --> 00:01:20,919
I happen to be in the right place at the

33
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,680
right time timing is everything and so

34
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:24,400
um I jumped on that I formed the law

35
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,759
firm of cannabis Council and tomorrow

36
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,840
you'll probably see me wearing the

37
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:29,920
T-shirt with my logo so now there are

38
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,640
four lawyers in our law for a Canabis

39
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:35,560
Council and so uh we represent

40
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,759
dispensaries and uh businesses and also

41
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:39,478
people who've been busted unfortunately

42
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,879
but the story I was going to tell was

43
00:01:39,478 --> 00:01:45,920
that we needed a home and so real estate

44
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:48,478
is cheap in Detroit I mean cheap so

45
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,079
they're giving stuff away so uh I was

46
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:52,799
lucky enough to find this building I

47
00:01:50,078 --> 00:01:55,519
used to drive by it every day on my way

48
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,399
to work at this office I used to rent

49
00:01:55,519 --> 00:02:00,158
and um they wanted a million dollars for

50
00:01:57,399 --> 00:02:02,718
this building and um well I got it for

51
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,560
about you know a tenth of that but the

52
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:07,158
point of the story was this building

53
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,360
used to be a radio station and the radio

54
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:12,080
station in Detroit was

55
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,200
wwww and at that time it was a rock in

56
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,440
the 70s it was a rock and roll radio

57
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:19,439
station and in fact Howard Stern was a

58
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:22,598
DJ who got a start there in Detroit in

59
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:25,439
at W4 and the the the stern story is

60
00:02:22,598 --> 00:02:27,639
that W4 changed their format one weekend

61
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:29,639
from Rock and Roll to Country and Howard

62
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:32,878
Stern came to work on Monday and said I

63
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:35,639
am not playing country music I quit Okay

64
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:37,840
well the short version is I ended up

65
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:40,000
buying that building and the studio

66
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,479
that's that they used as the broadcast

67
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,039
studio has turned into the medication

68
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:47,639
Lounge for our clients who are patients

69
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:49,759
so if you come to Detroit uh you can

70
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:52,238
come into the lounge there's a Steinway

71
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:55,639
grand piano in there in 1920 there's a

72
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:59,158
tuba a trombone a ukulele a harmonica a

73
00:02:55,639 --> 00:03:00,839
guitar um that's actually a a six string

74
00:02:59,158 --> 00:03:03,158
that I bought from for my 50th birthday

75
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,319
that I never learned to play and um

76
00:03:03,158 --> 00:03:06,079
there are a couple other musical

77
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:08,679
instruments so I invite you all to come

78
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,480
to Detroit and to Michigan um but I'm

79
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:12,319
here as the representative of Michigan

80
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:15,439
normal I'm the executive director of

81
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:17,479
Michigan normal this year yeah right on

82
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:18,919
we need to legalize it you know some

83
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:21,359
people say oh we shouldn't have a lawyer

84
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:23,399
as a director of normal because H he'll

85
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,799
be out of a job if we legalize it so

86
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:28,640
he's working against his own interests

87
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:30,400
right yeah uhhuh so I can't get a job

88
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:35,639
doing anything else you know that's the

89
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:39,000
problem so anyway um here we are and

90
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:41,359
uh I'm I think we need to legalize it so

91
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,080
we started a petition drive this year um

92
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:46,080
we needed

93
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:48,640
323,000 signatures in Michigan uh we

94
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,799
ended up with 54,000 signatures I

95
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:53,399
mistakenly thought that volunteers would

96
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:55,680
get up and do this work to just repeal

97
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,719
prohibition but it doesn't happen that

98
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,719
way um I guess I'm not as good a

99
00:03:57,719 --> 00:04:01,359
marketer as I need to be so we need to

100
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:04,400
raise a bunch of money we're planning to

101
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:07,720
do that in the next year or two and and

102
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:11,680
do it right um and we're looking for

103
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:15,039
Washington and Oregon and Colorado to

104
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,879
lead the way in legalizing marijuana so

105
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:19,159
that the rest of us so that we we can

106
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:22,240
see a wave across the country you know

107
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:25,560
I'm in Michigan which is just an island

108
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:28,680
in the middle between Rhode Island and

109
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:30,120
Oregon or Colorado there's there's not a

110
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,600

112
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,080

113
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:37,839
this year and there are some other

114
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:40,240
states that are on the ballot this year

115
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:41,839
and we need to support that so everybody

116
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,918
