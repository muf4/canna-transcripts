5
00:00:06,209 --> 00:00:11,789
our petition once it becomes enacted

6
00:00:08,939 --> 00:00:15,329

7
00:00:11,789 --> 00:00:18,538
to patients medicinal marijuana

8
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:20,759
it will our farmers to grow hemp and

9
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:25,679
compete in the world markets it will

10
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:28,500
allow individuals to grow and their own

11
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:33,210
personal quantities of hemp and will

12
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:36,539
allow the sale of marijuana to people in

13
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:38,399
coffee shops in bars and in liquor

14
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:41,750
stores just like hard alcohol is sold

15
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:43,980
now it's a it's a comprehensive

16
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:46,170
reworking of our laws as ours like to

17
00:00:43,979 --> 00:00:48,179
tell folks you know this initiatives

18
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:49,859
gonna raise hundreds of millions of

19
00:00:48,179 --> 00:00:51,329
dollars in revenue for the state we

20
00:00:49,859 --> 00:00:53,308
don't really know exactly how much but

21
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:55,350
we can say hundreds of millions of

22
00:00:53,308 --> 00:00:57,899
dollars because I like the sound that

23
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:59,460
hundreds of millions dollars well I also

24
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:01,378
Paula don't want to forget that it's

25
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:04,260
also going to allow us to save money

26
00:01:01,378 --> 00:01:07,228
they won't be so much money on putting

27
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:09,450
people in jail hiring no district

28
00:01:07,228 --> 00:01:12,239
attorneys hiring police officers public

29
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:14,299
defenders judges it all adds up so we'll

30
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:17,640
be saving money as well as getting tax

31
00:01:14,299 --> 00:01:20,670
money off of this hundreds of millions

32
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:22,829
of dollars and you know we dedicate that

33
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:25,290
money ninety percent of it to the state

34
00:01:22,829 --> 00:01:27,060
general fund where the legislature can

35
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:29,610
decide how to spend it we hope they'll

36
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:31,859
put it toward education but the other

37
00:01:29,609 --> 00:01:36,328
ten percent eight percent of that left

38
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:38,310
goes to drug treatment programs so that

39
00:01:36,328 --> 00:01:41,008
alcoholics and other people with

40
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:42,649
substance abuse product problems can get

41
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:45,930
the help they need when they need it

42
00:01:42,649 --> 00:01:48,149
final two percent one percent would go

43
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:50,368
to a comprehensive drug education

44
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:52,739
program for kids in schools taught by

45
00:01:50,368 --> 00:01:54,959
educational professionals not by the

46
00:01:52,739 --> 00:01:57,089
police like the DARE program is today

47
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:59,819
then that last one percent would go to

48
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:02,579
fund a state agricultural committee to

49
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:04,468
promote industrial hemp to try to

50
00:02:02,578 --> 00:02:08,008
restore its place here in our economy

51
00:02:04,468 --> 00:02:10,049

98
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:12,920
downtown Seattle it had grown to three

99
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:15,230
or four thousands the estimate

100
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:17,810

the rally after the million marijuana

109
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:43,160
March so Vivien McPeak who is also the

110
00:06:41,089 --> 00:06:45,769
emcee of the Seattle Hempfest which

111
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:49,370

115
00:06:55,430 --> 00:07:00,019

to be here today

117
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:06,979
Nora is the director of the November

118
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:08,449
coalition out of Colville Washington the

119
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:10,430
November Coalition is one of the most

120
00:07:08,449 --> 00:07:14,089
powerful organizations in the country to

121
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:15,680
end the drug war it started around 1977

122
00:07:14,089 --> 00:07:18,799
right before the Seattle Hempfest that

123
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:21,560
year what the November coalition does is

124
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,540
it puts names and faces behind the

125
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:27,889
prisoners the POWs of the war on drugs

126
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:29,720
and the war on pot and also behind they

127
00:07:27,889 --> 00:07:32,360
hidden the victims of the war on out of

128
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:35,930
the war on drugs which is the children

129
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:38,240

never killed anyone toxicity

137
00:07:56,370 --> 00:08:06,310
if somebody tells you different if a

138
00:07:59,259 --> 00:08:07,980
bold-faced lie there's a reason that

no concrete evidence whatsoever you can

147

be served to prison on hearsay evidence

148
00:08:31,329 --> 00:08:40,000
alone by paid informants who are already

149
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:42,589

150
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,889

00:09:46,809 --> 00:09:59,529
a owner and operator of him net hello

172
00:09:54,850 --> 00:10:03,240
Seattle right here in the middle

173
00:09:59,529 --> 00:10:03,240
Westlake Center you guys are awesome

174
00:10:03,389 --> 00:10:08,049
those of you to some of the marches

175
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:09,639
against prohibition last year I'm sure

176
00:10:08,049 --> 00:10:19,689
you can appreciate the members we see

177
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:21,220
here today today we've been marching and

178
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:23,380
speaking out against the numerous and

179
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:26,529
justices brought on the American people

180
00:10:23,379 --> 00:10:28,629
by the war on drugs we may be a diverse

181
00:10:26,529 --> 00:10:30,610
group of people with differing opinions

182
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:33,250
on the issues but one thing is common

183
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:35,139
amongst us all the war on drugs has

184
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:37,059
affected the lives of everyone of us

185
00:10:35,139 --> 00:10:39,069
enough so that you're willing to get in

186
00:10:37,059 --> 00:10:41,349
the streets and March and say that

187
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:43,860
things have got to change the drug war

188
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:43,860
is wrong

189
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:52,530
we know the truck was wrong because it's

190
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:55,470
fraught with injustice forfeiture laws

191
00:10:52,529 --> 00:10:57,990
are unjust because they allow a home or

192
00:10:55,470 --> 00:11:00,450
car to be taken without an individual to

193
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:02,820
be charged with a crime mandatory

194
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:05,300
minimums are unjust because there's no

195
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:08,129
room to consider the circumstances that

196
00:11:05,299 --> 00:11:10,769
go along with the rest the judge should

197
00:11:08,129 --> 00:11:12,629
have the option the legislature should

198
00:11:10,769 --> 00:11:15,600
not be saying you go to jail for ten

199
00:11:12,629 --> 00:11:18,059
years because you are related or heard

200
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:21,000
about a drug bust and the cannabis

201
00:11:18,059 --> 00:11:25,739
prohibition is unjust our laws are

202
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:28,379
hypocrisy parla it's hypocrisy that we

203
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:29,379
can drink alcohol we've killed hundreds

204
00:11:28,379 --> 00:11:32,439
of people every year

205
00:11:29,379 --> 00:11:34,480
[Applause]

206
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:37,480
it's a [ __ ] receipt you can legally

207
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:40,769
smoke nicotine and yet it kills hundreds

208
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:43,149
of thousands of people every year and

209
00:11:40,769 --> 00:11:44,949
yet I'll say it here is that you have

210
00:11:43,149 --> 00:11:46,600
the right to do that you should as a

211
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:50,970
free American being able to consume

212
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:50,970
nicotine to drink alcohol and smoke pot

213
00:11:55,049 --> 00:12:02,709
so what's the result of this unjust war

214
00:11:58,299 --> 00:12:05,379
well for example there's a mr. gray who

215
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:06,850
was the US Marine for five years he went

216
00:12:05,379 --> 00:12:09,429
off and served this country in the Gulf

217
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:12,310
War he came back with numerous

218
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:15,129
unexplainable illnesses uncontrollable

219
00:12:12,309 --> 00:12:18,219
vomiting he went to the VA hospital 20

220
00:12:15,129 --> 00:12:20,529
times they prescribed numerous legal

221
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:23,259
drugs none of them which could help him

222
00:12:20,529 --> 00:12:25,419
so finally he turned like many sufferers

223
00:12:23,259 --> 00:12:28,029
of the Gulf War Syndrome due to

224
00:12:25,419 --> 00:12:32,789
marijuana and he found relief and how do

225
00:12:28,029 --> 00:12:32,789
we thank him steal his [ __ ] house

226
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:38,840
[Applause]

227
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:41,060
another Justice is the Eastside

228
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:43,399
Narcotics Task Force we allow them to

229
00:12:41,059 --> 00:12:45,739
engage in terrorist tactics destroying

230
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:50,169
homes and traumatizing children house

231
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:50,169
after house after house that's unjust

232
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:55,440
and just that will foster the crows

233
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:58,350
marijuana for his own personal medical

234
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:00,770
reason should be sentenced to 93 years

235
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:00,769
in jail

236
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:10,819
the drug more needs to change 80% of our

237
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:12,920
forfeitures occur where no individual

238
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:15,379
'its was charged with a crime I think

239
00:13:12,919 --> 00:13:17,569
this is such an injustice and we don't

240
00:13:15,379 --> 00:13:19,639
have to look farther that our own law of

241
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:21,740
Washington to see the problems with his

242
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:23,449
law so I'm going to read the three

243
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:26,839
pillars of the Washington State

244
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:28,940
forfeiture law tenet number one and this

245
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:31,910
is in the hip voters guide if you saw

246
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:34,279
this last year number one in cases

247
00:13:31,909 --> 00:13:36,439
involving property personal property the

248
00:13:34,278 --> 00:13:38,028
burden of producing evidence shall be

249
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:41,180
upon the person claiming to be the

250
00:13:38,028 --> 00:13:43,338
lawful owner of the property that's you

251
00:13:41,179 --> 00:13:45,559
that's not the cops if they plan

252
00:13:43,339 --> 00:13:47,450
something to shove you up to you to

253
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:49,309
prove it if your friend has a joint in

254
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:51,470
your car and they take your car it's

255
00:13:49,309 --> 00:13:53,269
your responsibility to prove it there's

256
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:58,339
no due process in that and there's no

257
00:13:53,269 --> 00:14:00,110
justice in that look at the next two

258
00:13:58,339 --> 00:14:02,300
floors of the Washington state farm to

259
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:03,680
drill on number two is each seizing

260
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:05,599
agency sorry meant to the state

261
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:07,759
treasurer and about equal to ten percent

262
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:10,850
of the net proceeds of any of the

263
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:13,330
property for critism final pillar what

264
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:15,950
happens to the other ninety percent

265
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:17,330
property and the net proceeds not

266
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:19,339
required if I'm paid to the State

267
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:22,420
Treasurer shall be retained by the

268
00:14:19,339 --> 00:14:25,249
seizing law enforcement agency

269
00:14:22,419 --> 00:14:27,688
[Applause]

270
00:14:25,249 --> 00:14:31,048
and as an invitation for corruptness

271
00:14:27,688 --> 00:14:31,980
it's no longer a balanced justice system

272
00:14:31,048 --> 00:14:34,588
that we're supposed to have in the

273
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:37,060
United States the forfeiture laws and

274
00:14:34,589 --> 00:14:43,399
the drug war needs to change

275
00:14:37,059 --> 00:14:45,688
[Applause]

276
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:47,818
alright and I hope you enjoyed a little

277
00:14:45,688 --> 00:14:50,248
flavor that day up in Seattle the

278
00:14:47,818 --> 00:14:51,628
million marijuana March it was a great

279
00:14:50,249 --> 00:14:53,069
sunny day where there was perfect

280
00:14:51,629 --> 00:14:55,438
weather for the March people had a lot

281
00:14:53,068 --> 00:14:57,659
of fun as you could see good speakers

282
00:14:55,438 --> 00:14:59,789
and you know once you tell us a little

283
00:14:57,659 --> 00:15:02,730
about the whole idea behind the million

284
00:14:59,789 --> 00:15:04,738
marijuana March Paul well you know it

285
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:06,569
has a long history it's been called the

286
00:15:04,739 --> 00:15:09,209
million marijuana March for about the

287
00:15:06,568 --> 00:15:11,998
past three years and up until this year

288
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:15,208
it had just taken place in New York City

289
00:15:11,999 --> 00:15:19,109
it had a history in New York City going

290
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:21,659
back to like 1970 as the Fifth Avenue

291
00:15:19,109 --> 00:15:24,119
made a pot parade that put on by the

292
00:15:21,659 --> 00:15:26,278
yuppies the group started by Abbie

293
00:15:24,119 --> 00:15:28,259
Hoffman and Jerry Rubin back in the 60s

294
00:15:26,278 --> 00:15:31,499
but anyway they've been doing the march

295
00:15:28,259 --> 00:15:34,350
there but back in about 1995 when they

296
00:15:31,499 --> 00:15:37,230
had the Million Man March by the Nation

297
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:39,298
of Islam they they start calling up the

298
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:42,778
million marijuana March and this year

299
00:15:39,298 --> 00:15:44,759
was the first time that they had broken

300
00:15:42,778 --> 00:15:46,708
out into other cities and in fact there

301
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:49,259
were marches taking place all over the

302
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:52,078
world in Amsterdam and Auckland New

303
00:15:49,259 --> 00:15:56,068
Zealand in Sydney Australia and San

304
00:15:52,078 --> 00:15:57,958
Francisco and New York of course Chicago

305
00:15:56,068 --> 00:15:59,668
I can't even begin to name all the

306
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:01,558
cities that this thing was going on in

307
00:15:59,668 --> 00:16:02,909
and maybe it did approach a million

308
00:16:01,558 --> 00:16:05,668
people when you talk about it on a

309
00:16:02,909 --> 00:16:07,198
worldwide scale you know that's what I

310
00:16:05,668 --> 00:16:08,428
heard they did approach a million I

311
00:16:07,198 --> 00:16:10,349
think that's great you know that's the

312
00:16:08,428 --> 00:16:11,970
whole idea behind it a pass I've never

313
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:14,089
had a million this year they had a

314
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:16,949
million marchers across the world

315
00:16:14,089 --> 00:16:18,959
speaking up for marijuana and hoping

316
00:16:16,948 --> 00:16:21,298
next year I made a it'll grow even

317
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:25,638
bigger so remember that date folks

318

00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:33,178
part in

322
00:16:30,808 --> 00:16:34,798
you know we're circulating the Oregon

323
00:16:33,178 --> 00:16:37,350
cannabis Tax Act petition

324
00:16:34,798 --> 00:16:38,350
this will allow adults to legally buy

325
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:41,649
marijuana

326
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:43,509
two state liquor stores bars and other

327
00:16:41,649 --> 00:16:46,329
shops that get the license will be able

328
00:16:43,509 --> 00:16:48,879
to serve marijuana the same way they

329
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:51,400
serve mixed alcoholic drinks it will

330
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:53,470
also allow farmers to cultivate the drug

331
00:16:51,399 --> 00:16:55,299
for sales to the Oregon Liquor Control

332
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:57,090
Commission the Oregon Liquor Control

333
00:16:55,299 --> 00:17:00,399
Commission would sell it through

334
00:16:57,090 --> 00:17:03,190
pharmacies both in Oregon and outside at

335
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:05,819
cost we're just cover the cost of the

336
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:08,200
agency and the farmers expenses and then

337
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:10,450
it would sell it at a profit through our

338
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:13,210
state liquor stores and raise lots of

339
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:16,299
money so it would also allow adults to

340
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:18,400
grow their own and allow farmers to

341
00:17:16,299 --> 00:17:21,819
cultivate industrial hemp without a

342
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:25,180
license so that they could produce paper

343
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:26,889
fabric protein oil fuel and 50,000

344
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:29,080
different products so we need your help

345
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:31,509
to put this important issue on the

346
00:17:29,079 --> 00:17:34,179
ballot you know if you can help us

347
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:36,069
petition in public if you can help us in

348
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:38,170
our office if you can help us on our

349
00:17:36,069 --> 00:17:40,299
phone banks if you just want to get the

350
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:40,900
petition just so you can sign it

351
00:17:40,299 --> 00:17:44,619
yourself

352
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:47,560
call us and what's that number Erico 503

353
00:17:44,619 --> 00:17:50,639
two three five four six zero six

354
00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:54,250
that's two three five four six oh six

355
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:56,380
call us we have voicemail if we're not

356
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:58,890
right there and you can also look at our

357
00:17:56,380 --> 00:18:02,200
website it's one most of the major

358
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:04,660
website Awards from Netscape what school

359
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:07,000
and so on but you can print our petition

360
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:09,490
out from the internet you can watch this

361
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,890
TV show on the internet you can watch a

362
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:13,420
hundred different videos but you can get

363
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:21,070
our attention directly through the

364
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:23,470
internet at WWE our Rho our G so now

365
00:18:21,069 --> 00:18:27,039
we're going to go into another segment

366
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:31,240
of our interview with the Dean emeritus

367
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:34,720
of Oregon Health Sciences University dr.

368
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:37,599
John Benson dr. Benson was also one of

369
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:39,309
the two principal co-investigators for

370
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:42,159
the National Academy of Sciences

371
00:18:39,309 --> 00:18:45,789
Institute of Medicine report that was

372
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:48,490
issued in March 1999 called marijuana

373
00:18:45,789 --> 00:18:52,089
and medicine assessing the science base

374
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:54,038
and this is a real good interview it

375
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:57,069
technical at times goes into a lot of

376
00:18:54,038 --> 00:19:00,640
the the details behind the pharmacology

377
00:18:57,069 --> 00:19:04,418
of cannabis and its use as a medicinal

378
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:07,028
agent so I guess we'll just run right

379
00:19:04,419 --> 00:19:08,169
into that hope you enjoy it some of the

380
00:19:07,028 --> 00:19:10,890
people who were on the panel I've

381
00:19:08,169 --> 00:19:13,990
recalled that the Israeli scientists

382
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:17,259
because neutrophil not cool mccoullough

383
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:19,808
Mikula he's the one who discovered THC

384
00:19:17,259 --> 00:19:21,339
about 25 years ago and then discovered

385
00:19:19,808 --> 00:19:24,190
the receptor sites or at least worked on

386
00:19:21,339 --> 00:19:27,129
the team worked on those and has also

387
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:30,850
been involved in some of the endogenous

388
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:34,360
cannabinoids natural substances we all

389
00:19:30,849 --> 00:19:40,148
have in our brains and bodies as well

390
00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:44,369
still very active right are those coming

391
00:19:40,148 --> 00:19:47,288
to endorphins are there a different

392
00:19:44,369 --> 00:19:51,569
group of chemicals also endogenous

393
00:19:47,288 --> 00:19:54,158
though that use different receptors

394
00:19:51,569 --> 00:19:58,329
there are different receptors for the

395
00:19:54,159 --> 00:20:03,880
opioids morphine and codeine those two

396
00:19:58,329 --> 00:20:08,710
substances so the endorphins are among

397
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:11,110
these agents that help energize the

398
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:13,528
neurons to put out transmitters in

399
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:17,019
various centers of the brain and

400
00:20:13,528 --> 00:20:21,569
cannabinoids or the components of the

401
00:20:17,019 --> 00:20:23,769
marijuana leaf are yet another system

402
00:20:21,569 --> 00:20:26,048
pharmacological system so that

403
00:20:23,769 --> 00:20:29,889
endogenous system I hope you think they

404
00:20:26,048 --> 00:20:32,408
call it the endorphin like substance

405
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:37,179
since the anatomy it's a Septon and

406
00:20:32,409 --> 00:20:42,130
amide yes the one that is best developed

407
00:20:37,179 --> 00:20:46,870
it also uses the so called cb1 receptor

408
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:49,570
cannabinoid one receptor and such as THC

409
00:20:46,869 --> 00:20:56,639
does and then there's another one that's

410
00:20:49,569 --> 00:21:00,049
2 AG Iraq and Daniel glycerol

411
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:04,740
which is another of these and endogenous

412
00:21:00,049 --> 00:21:09,119
cannabinoids like substances have they

413
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:13,019
identified the primary action of this

414
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:16,019
receptor system is that there are many

415
00:21:13,019 --> 00:21:19,200
actions actually there the receptors

416
00:21:16,019 --> 00:21:22,109
have been identified and cloned actually

417
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:24,029
and they can be cited or located in

418
00:21:22,109 --> 00:21:28,079
various parts of the brain that had to

419
00:21:24,029 --> 00:21:33,049
do with pain perception with movement

420
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:37,109
control with control of vomiting with

421
00:21:33,049 --> 00:21:41,339
warm and pleasant feelings with sedation

422
00:21:37,109 --> 00:21:46,039
and so forth so they're very common

423
00:21:41,339 --> 00:21:49,919
throughout the brain so that there is

424
00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:53,029
definite what should we say therapeutic

425
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:57,539
action of these substances would that be

426
00:21:53,029 --> 00:22:00,029
well I mean I wouldn't say the actions

427
00:21:57,539 --> 00:22:02,460
that you mentioned seemed to me to be

428
00:22:00,029 --> 00:22:04,619
therapeutic in nature could be 30 well

429
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:07,230
they might be exploited for therapeutic

430
00:22:04,619 --> 00:22:13,139
uses that's correct because there are

431
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:16,579
these systems yes in place and that's

432
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:20,250
the reason I'm sure that people have

433
00:22:16,579 --> 00:22:24,779
found some utility for the use of these

434
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:26,400
cannabinoid substances before the

435
00:22:24,779 --> 00:22:33,329
president of the Institute of Medicine

436
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:34,740
asked you to be a co-investigator can

437
00:22:33,329 --> 00:22:37,009
you tell us about the process that led

438
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:42,120
up to the Institute of Medicine

439
00:22:37,009 --> 00:22:44,039
conducting this inquiry yes the White

440
00:22:42,119 --> 00:22:47,129
House Office of National Drug Control

441
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:52,170
Policy which is directed by Barry

442
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:55,110
McCaffrey ask the Institute concept to

443
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:59,850
consider such a study and was willing to

444
00:22:55,109 --> 00:23:04,319
fund it about the same time a major

445
00:22:59,849 --> 00:23:06,319
foundation also thought this would be

446
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:08,720
worthy of study

447
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:11,960
but the Institute thought it better and

448
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:14,870
so did it apparently general McCaffrey

449
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:19,160
if only the one sponsor were responsible

450
00:23:14,869 --> 00:23:23,329
and so a proposal was made to the his

451
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:25,850
office by the Institute staff which led

452
00:23:23,329 --> 00:23:31,399
to a statement of task so called and

453
00:23:25,849 --> 00:23:33,169
then the funding of the study what was

454
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:35,450
the mandate from the Office of National

455
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:38,810
Drug Control Policy on that didn't they

456
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:40,850
exclude they just won the medical report

457
00:23:38,809 --> 00:23:43,099
nothing to do with science sir well

458
00:23:40,849 --> 00:23:45,079
there's no lens the science yes they

459
00:23:43,099 --> 00:23:47,539
wanted the scientific basis for any

460
00:23:45,079 --> 00:23:51,799
benefits or harms that might come from

461
00:23:47,539 --> 00:23:56,480
the medical use of marijuana or its

462
00:23:51,799 --> 00:23:59,589
component substances and we were not

463
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:04,099
restricted but we were not picked either

464
00:23:59,589 --> 00:24:06,829
to address issues of social legislative

465
00:24:04,099 --> 00:24:09,230
regulatory at cetera kinds of

466
00:24:06,829 --> 00:24:11,929
considerations I think it would have

467
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:14,269
been a very different statement of task

468
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:16,789
and a very different group that could

469
00:24:14,269 --> 00:24:18,440
not have included me were you involved

470
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:21,799
at all I know that the Institute of

471
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:24,529
Medicine produced a report 15 years

472
00:24:21,799 --> 00:24:27,859
before regarding marijuana not

473
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:31,399
specifically as medicine there was

474
00:24:27,859 --> 00:24:36,439
viewed that oh absolutely I was not that

475
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:41,060
was in 1982 and it was frustrated by the

476
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:44,509
lack of clear science rigorous

477
00:24:41,059 --> 00:24:48,349
experimentation and called repeatedly

478
00:24:44,509 --> 00:24:52,250
for research in various fields in the

479
00:24:48,349 --> 00:24:55,879
meantime there's been a explosion of

480
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:59,829
knowledge in the basic science field all

481
00:24:55,880 --> 00:25:02,390
of these an and amide and receptors and

482
00:24:59,829 --> 00:25:05,569
neurotransmitters and sighting of these

483
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:08,630
things and various control areas in the

484
00:25:05,569 --> 00:25:10,970
brain have been elaborated so we were at

485
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:13,590
a distinct advantage over the people who

486
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:17,519
did that study

487
00:25:13,589 --> 00:25:20,548
and we hope we carried things a bit

488
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:22,679
further because of that new science

489
00:25:20,548 --> 00:25:26,009
could you address that explosion in

490
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:29,700
science and discovery of the receptor

491
00:25:26,009 --> 00:25:33,859
system and a bit for our audience well

492
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:39,990
it really was the identification of the

493
00:25:33,859 --> 00:25:42,990
receptors themselves cloning them citing

494
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:46,380
them wherever they were found both in

495
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:48,538
the brain and peripherally the CB to

496
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:52,440
that cannabinoid to receptor is

497
00:25:48,538 --> 00:25:57,269
primarily in the immune system and more

498
00:25:52,440 --> 00:26:02,690
peripheral nervous system and CB one is

499
00:25:57,269 --> 00:26:05,730
primarily in the brain these endogenous

500
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:09,210
cannabinoids like substances that I've
