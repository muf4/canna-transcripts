1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:06,639
so the political Mantra this season is

2
00:00:03,799 --> 00:00:08,839
jobs jobs jobs you're hearing it from at

3
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:12,080
least Democratic candidates everywhere

4
00:00:08,839 --> 00:00:14,399
in the country so I went down to the

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,240
picnic at the labor temple in Madison

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,560
last

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,359
Monday and you know that's always full

8
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:24,479
of political candidates chasing the

9
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:26,840
union vote as I caught members of legisl

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,800
where we'd had a hemp Bill cleared the

11
00:00:26,839 --> 00:00:32,599
agriculture committee with a comfortable

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:36,399
margin but never got a floor vat since

13
00:00:32,598 --> 00:00:39,398
you guys are talking jobs jobs jobs let

14
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:42,439
me show you some jobs and I pulled out

15
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:45,120
these cards come and grab one with a

16
00:00:42,439 --> 00:00:50,759
photo of the employees of the Fairwater

17
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:50,759
hemp company of Fairwater Wisconsin in

18
00:00:56,878 --> 00:01:04,280
1917 and uh the fairw Water hemp company

19
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:06,319
has another unique place in history it

20
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:08,799
was the first place that hemp was ever

21
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:12,279
used as an energy

22
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:15,000
crop uh cross the Grand River was the

23
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:17,439
Fairwater Water Wheel the largest of its

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,879
kind generating electric power for the

25
00:01:17,438 --> 00:01:23,199
nearby

26
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:26,640
Villages and uh as demand grew as they

27
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:29,960
got more distribution line laid there

28
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:32,840
came a point where in the fall during

29
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:36,319
the dry season there wasn't enough Hydro

30
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:38,040
power to supply the whole customer base

31
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:40,438
they

32
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,200
built well the owner of the water wheel

33
00:01:40,438 --> 00:01:44,679
was the son-in-law of the guy who owned

34
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:47,640
a hmill across the river and he noticed

35
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:51,479
his uh father-in-law had this Kil that

36
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:55,319
was burning all of the waste products of

37
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:57,920
their rope manufacturer the herds and he

38
00:01:55,319 --> 00:02:02,798
said let's get a steam

39
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:06,599
engine so for the drive fall months for

40
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:09,640
at least 2 years uh The Villages of

41
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:12,919
Fairwater and Marcus and surrounding

42
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:14,399
Countryside were indeed powered by hemp

43
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:17,079
for

44
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,360
electric uh it's my belief that at this

45
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:21,800
point until we get really good

46
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:26,959
technology

47
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:30,879
for making liquid fuels from low density

48
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:32,959
solid biomass like hem stocks

49
00:02:30,878 --> 00:02:35,239
that we really will actually be seeing

50
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:38,120
hemp playing a role in electric

51
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:40,920
generation before it's really viable as

52
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:45,080
a liquid fuel it's not that you can't

53
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:47,399
grow enough biomass it's that the

54
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:49,280
conversion to the high density liquid

55
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,599
that you can haul around in a car is

56
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,280
still very energy

57
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:57,158
intensive and when Donnie and I were

58
00:02:54,280 --> 00:03:00,519
first talking about this stuff in 1992

59
00:02:57,158 --> 00:03:03,158
the lab guys were saying oh cellulose to

60
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:06,799
ethanols right around the corner well

61
00:03:03,158 --> 00:03:09,759
it's turned out to be a very soft

62
00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:11,200
Corner yes they are closer but I'm not

63
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:13,039
going to say it's you know something

64
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:16,439
happening as fast as we can get the laws

65
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:16,439
on hemp change
