specifically the continued prohibition

00:00:45,558 --> 00:00:50,198
of hemp marijuana cultivation prevents

9
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:53,078
our society from utilizing Nature's

George washhington he and All American

farmers were required to grow and could

16
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:09,359
even pay their taxes with hemp why

17
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:11,118
because hemp was the used for the

18
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:14,599

instructing patriotic American farmers

to grow 350,000 acres of hemp per year

00:01:51,078 --> 00:01:56,319
uses the sun more efficiently than

37
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:58,919
virtually any other planet on our planet

38
00:01:56,319 --> 00:02:02,879
in fact on a planet wide climate wide

39
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:06,320
and soil wide basis hemp grown annually

40
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:09,318
would produce approximately 40 times the

41
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:12,239
biomass that is living organic matter of

42
00:02:09,318 --> 00:02:15,560
the next best annual rival biomass crops

43
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:19,159
that be can grown on Earth such as corn

44
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:19,159
kunu and sugar

45
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:23,879
cane today we have the ability in the

46
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,519
mechanized technology to use hemp

47
00:02:23,878 --> 00:02:30,280
biomass and other biomasses for energy

48
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:32,120
farming and produce all of the clean

49
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,919
Renewable Fuel we would need for all of

50
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:35,920
our

54
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:46,158
shown that reversing the greenhouse

55
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:50,759
effect will only be possible if possible

56
00:02:46,158 --> 00:02:53,280
at all if hemp and other biomass Wast

57
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:55,239
are used again as they were until 130

58
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,280
years ago for making the overall

59
00:02:55,239 --> 00:02:59,439
majority of Earth's paper fiber fuels

60
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:03,680

plastic to Dynamite as for

62
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,120
marijuana the blossom of the hemp plant

63
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:09,919
US Government clinical studies as well

64
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:12,480
as studies of the Jamaican Costa Rican

65
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:14,798
and Greek marijuana using populations

66
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:16,318
indicate statistically that you will

67
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:18,159
live more than a year longer if you

68
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:22,280
smoke marijuana every day than if you

69
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:25,000
use no drugs at all and 8 to 24 years

70
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:28,640
longer than regular tobacco and alcohol

71
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,479
users in 1987 US Government statistics

72
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:34,759
reported 39 5,000 Americans died from

73
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:37,399
tobacco 87% of all lung cancer cases

74
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:39,239
were caused by tobacco use also the

75
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:42,959
National Institute of drug abuse that's

76
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:46,840
nighta reports 125,000 Americans died in

77
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:48,759
1987 from alcohol use that same agency

78
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:52,640
and the surgeon general's mortality

79
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:55,679
statistics report zero Zer deaths ever

80
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:59,158
due to marijuana and as of October

81
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:02,200
1988 no case of lung cancer has ever

82
00:03:59,158 --> 00:04:05,560
been a tri uted solely to marijuana

83
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:08,318
use therefore we at hemp are seeking a

84
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:11,560
marijuana hemp armus that is an

85
00:04:08,318 --> 00:04:13,078
immediate Nationwide moratorium on the

86
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:15,039
personal medical and Industrial

87
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:16,600
suppression of hemp and for the

88
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:19,079
president in Congress to immediately

89
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:21,519
appoint a hemp advisory commission to

90
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:24,478
oversee and expedite reintroduction of

91
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:25,360
hemp to American agriculture business

92
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:28,079
and

93
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,960
Medicine our justifications for this

94
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:32,918
moratorium commission are that with few

95
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:34,959
exceptions none of the American public

96
00:04:32,918 --> 00:04:37,120
especially our politicians who should

97
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:38,519
have known when they made these laws the

98
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,240
judges who should have known when they

99
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:42,758
enforced them and the police and even

100
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,680
the teachers who should have taught them

101
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:47,479
and all the rest of us in the first

102
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:48,720
place knew virtually any of the

103
00:04:47,478 --> 00:04:51,918
preceding

104
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:54,639
history facts information or the vast

105
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:58,879
potential of hemp as Earth's Premier

106
00:04:54,639 --> 00:05:01,038
natural renewable resource biomass and

107
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:03,439
life extend

108
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:06,599
if I have to go to jail for fighting for

109
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:09,719
that or give of any other part or you

110
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:11,639
should you should be proud to I mean

111
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:14,160
such a sweet thing as marijuana to go to

112
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:16,160
jail for put there by people that don't

113
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:19,759
even know this information haven't the

114
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:22,160
foggiest idea and yet chemicals

115
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,759
petrochemicals fossil fuels are totally

116
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,160
legal and hemp one of the greatest

117
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:27,120
things that we if not the greatest

118
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:29,960
natural growing thing on earth is

119
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,360
illegal every damn politician out they

120
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:33,279
be should be ashamed of themselves

121
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,960
forever if they continue this now that

122
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:36,439
they know this or they and don't check

123
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:38,638
it out if they've heard it and they

124
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:40,399
don't believe it check it out but if

125
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,720
it's true you better change your ways

126
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:44,638
because if a world would accept you I

127
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,199
wouldn't want to live in that world and

128
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,038
if the world doesn't accept you you

129
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:50,160
should you should be proud of a world

130
00:05:48,038 --> 00:05:52,639
that would teach you how to behave like

131
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:55,160
adults like you want kids to behave like

132
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:57,360
to be responsible to control their uses

133
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:59,680
we expect you to control the abuses of

134
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:03,080
the power of legislating stupidity

135
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:06,319
ignorance and the end of my Planet

136
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:06,318
that's all
