1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,509
I want to talk about something that I

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:06,059
think not many people here aware of is

3
00:00:03,509 --> 00:00:08,759
that the there is another industrial

4
00:00:06,059 --> 00:00:11,669
hemp farming act in Congress and it was

5
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:14,849
introduced in May by representative ron

6
00:00:11,669 --> 00:00:17,309
paul and it already has more co-sponsors

7
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:19,410
that we've ever had on an industrial

8
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:21,299
hemp farming act a bill this is the

9
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:22,649
leave the third bill that has been

10
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,570
introduced by representative ron paul

11
00:00:22,649 --> 00:00:28,079
and that's because the hard work of a

12
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:29,879
group called vote hemp all right so vote

13
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:31,858
HAP is a pretty much single issue

14
00:00:29,879 --> 00:00:33,960
focusing just on the industrial hemp

15
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:36,710
side of things that Eric stienstra who

16
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,759
is the president of boat him this year

17
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:40,890
finally got on board with some of us

18
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:42,839
who've been urging for longer than more

19
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:46,549
than a year that it's time to hitch our

20
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:49,649
star to moving medical and recreational

21
00:00:46,549 --> 00:00:52,109
legislation and so we've worked with the

22
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:54,359
proposition folks in California and

23
00:00:52,109 --> 00:00:58,289
Colorado here in this state we're

24
00:00:54,359 --> 00:01:01,259
including industrial hemp now as a as a

25
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:03,480
as comes under the will come under the

26
00:01:01,259 --> 00:01:05,879
same initiatives and legislation that's

27
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:09,000
moving around the country work this is a

28
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:10,649
new strategy honestly the last 10 years

29
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,269
surprisingly we've worked totally

30
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:13,740
separate people working on medical

31
00:01:12,269 --> 00:01:16,170
corporate people working on industrial

32
00:01:13,739 --> 00:01:18,688
I've worked separately and I think the

33
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:19,950
big change in the last 12 months since

34
00:01:18,688 --> 00:01:23,899
we were sitting on the stage a year ago

35
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:26,520
is that there's a new openness towards

36
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:28,320
including industrial hemp with what

37
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:30,658
really is a more popular issue and there

38
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:33,149
is medical cannabis recreational

39
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:36,329
cannabis marijuana you know in the East

40
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:38,070
Coast if you say cannabis people's eyes

41
00:01:36,328 --> 00:01:39,809
glaze over they actually don't know what

42
00:01:38,069 --> 00:01:41,099
you're talking about there's there's

43
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:43,590
something trying to be quite a bit of

44
00:01:41,099 --> 00:01:45,298
ignorance still as to what do you even

45
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:47,430
is in what is cannabis you say marijuana

46
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:49,618
you'd ninety-five percent of people know

47
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:52,649
you're talking about so I'm just going

48
00:01:49,618 --> 00:01:55,200
to say that you know there is a the East

49
00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:58,530
Coast deficit of knowledge on this issue

50
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:01,020
and what our biggest challenge is is to

51
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:03,060
continue to educate politicians that

52
00:02:01,019 --> 00:02:06,780
goes that go to Washington to write laws

53
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:08,789
that this is a safe issue the industrial

54
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:10,560
hemp issue and it's probably now the

55
00:02:08,788 --> 00:02:12,619
whole issue is safe it's not just

56
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,170
industrial hemp it's it's mad

57
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:17,480
Michael it's even the idea of just tax

58
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:20,689
and regulate so i'll leave it there and

59
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:22,128
but we there is this bill in congress

60
00:02:20,689 --> 00:02:24,019
and industrial hemp farming act and I

61
00:02:22,128 --> 00:02:25,939
really hope if you're you haven't

62
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:27,349
already called your Congressman in the

63
00:02:25,939 --> 00:02:30,169
last month you haven't been calling

64
00:02:27,348 --> 00:02:32,179
enough so give them a call or her a call

65
00:02:30,169 --> 00:02:35,500
and ask them to support that though

66
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:35,500
thank you so much
