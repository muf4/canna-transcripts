1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,600
I met a group of people out in

2
00:00:01,399 --> 00:00:06,519
Harrisburg Oregon who decided that they

3
00:00:04,599 --> 00:00:10,558
they they would like to

4
00:00:06,519 --> 00:00:13,160
import hemp excuse me from Spain through

5
00:00:10,558 --> 00:00:15,359
France and so we did and we had to get

6
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:17,640
the dea's permission so we imported this

7
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:20,079
hemp and then we took that hemp and we

8
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,679
made Boards out of

9
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:24,759
it it's really a nice guitar and this is

10
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:27,719
a really old piece of wood that the wood

11
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:30,400
is older than the the guitar so what's

12
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:34,280
going on is I've got this piece of wood

13
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:36,679
that's 20 years old and it has an age

14
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:38,359
today right and it was made out of hemp

15
00:00:36,679 --> 00:00:40,519
fibers that we imported from Spain

16
00:00:38,359 --> 00:00:42,679
through France and we were able to prove

17
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:45,399
through this piece of wood right here or

18
00:00:42,679 --> 00:00:47,280
actually medium density fiber board that

19
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:50,759
we could actually create medium density

20
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,558
fiber board and that because of that we

21
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:57,358
have the ability to

22
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:59,439
change the the dynamic in the woods okay

23
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:01,920
now we proved this 20 years ago but

24
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:04,079
because we do not have anywhere in the

25
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,640
world we do not have enough adequate

26
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:09,118
Supply to actually do it I mean nobody's

27
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,719
growing hemp fields in United States

28
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:12,519
unless you run out in Nebraska and get

29
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:15,000
some of the ditch weed I mean it is

30
00:01:12,519 --> 00:01:16,599
everywhere you know it is you've seen it

31
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,438
and that's what's going on you know we

32
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:21,519
we just don't have a real Supply if we

33
00:01:18,438 --> 00:01:24,158
ever had a supply I mean tomorrow we

34
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:26,039
could be producing Boards out of hemp we

35
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:29,320
could be turning all the herd in the

36
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:32,040
inside of the stock into Visos and and

37
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:34,679
making you know know chairs for

38
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,759
astronauts that will never break you

39
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,079
know we could do things that you

40
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,879
couldn't you could even imagine but we

41
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:42,078
we actually can't because we got a big

42
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:43,438
imagination so one of the reasons that I

43
00:01:42,078 --> 00:01:48,039
keep fighting and I've been doing this

44
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:51,359
for over 30 years is I believe I believe

45
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,359
I believe
