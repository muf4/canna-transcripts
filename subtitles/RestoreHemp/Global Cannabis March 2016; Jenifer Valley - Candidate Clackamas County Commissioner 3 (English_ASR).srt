1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,429
you know I am the only candidate running

2
00:00:03,178 --> 00:00:08,820
for Clackamas County Commissioner that

3
00:00:05,429 --> 00:00:11,550
voted in favor of measure 91 I think

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:14,309
it's important that all of us who voted

5
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:17,519
for measure 91 get involved in our

6
00:00:14,308 --> 00:00:21,118
communities at every level city county

7
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:24,239
state doesn't matter we all really need

8
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:26,219
to be involved and and talking to Oregon

9
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:28,169
Health Authority especially because

10
00:00:26,219 --> 00:00:30,809
they're the ones who are running our

11
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:33,420
medical marijuana program straight into

12
00:00:30,809 --> 00:00:36,210
the ground right now I am running for

13
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:38,760
Clackamas County Commission because when

14
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:41,429
we legalized marijuana fifty-seven

15
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:43,619
percent of clackamas county voters voted

16
00:00:41,429 --> 00:00:45,659
in favor of it but not one of our

17
00:00:43,619 --> 00:00:49,769
Clackamas County Commissioners did and

18
00:00:45,659 --> 00:00:52,648
they decided to go with their vote when

19
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:54,899
it came time to make regulations they

20
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:57,270
didn't consider the fact that they were

21
00:00:54,899 --> 00:01:00,539
on the losing side of that vote and

22
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:03,420
instead of opting out of legalization

23
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:05,460
they decided to zone it out and they

24
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:07,290
made it nearly impossible to start a

25
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:09,899
cannabis business in clackamas county

26
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:11,640
and that made me mad enough to want to

27
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:14,250
run for office and let them know that

28
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:17,250
they were wrong so I hope you'll all

29
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:18,840
support me in my run and I'd like to see

30
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:21,709
you all out there at the Oregon Health

31
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:25,400
Authority meetings have a great day

32
00:01:21,709 --> 00:01:25,399
let's get to margin
