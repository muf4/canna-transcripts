21
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:03,329
the whole thing but in my work there

22
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:05,879
what I found is I talked to people and I

23
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:07,829
and I find out why you coming to the

24
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:11,000
club why aren't you at home why aren't

25
00:01:07,829 --> 00:01:13,590
you hanging out in your own space

26
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,368
parents don't want to smoke pot around

27
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:20,219
their kids so just like a bar or a cigar

28
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:22,920
bar they need a place to go socialize

29
00:01:20,219 --> 00:01:25,978
away from their mind or children because

30
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,868
they're responsible parents we have

31
00:01:25,978 --> 00:01:30,030
other people that come in you know what

32
00:01:27,868 --> 00:01:33,060
the housing situation is here it's tight

33
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:36,150
I know people that are literally living

34
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:38,040
in trailers and come in to our nice club

35
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:41,280
because they want to entertain their

36
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:43,618
guests and they want to socialize and

37
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,379
I'll tell you you know the days of

38
00:01:43,618 --> 00:01:48,239
reefer madness are going away but

39
00:01:46,379 --> 00:01:51,688
unfortunately we need more people in the

40
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:55,259
state house so it goes away more the

41
00:01:51,688 --> 00:01:56,489
organ cleaned or Clean Air Act one is

42
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:58,530
the method that they're using to

43
00:01:56,489 --> 00:02:03,089
regulate us they want to say that there

44
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:04,680
can be no smoking anywhere well you know

45
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:07,020
we're supposed to be free to associate

46
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:09,118
with each other if it's legal for me to

47
00:02:07,019 --> 00:02:11,639
smoke a joint at home why should it be

48
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:13,530
legal for me to smoke a club socially

49
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:17,129
somewhere

50
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:18,840
so I'm only one voice but I see a lot of

51
00:02:17,129 --> 00:02:21,209
voices out here and here's the thing

52
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:24,360
that I want you to do I know you're

53
00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:27,840
already registered to vote you know what

54
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:30,390
laws you want there to be in effect do

55
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:34,409
you know who represents you either

56
00:02:30,389 --> 00:02:38,458
locally or in the State House have you

57
00:02:34,409 --> 00:02:41,879
ever contacted them have you ever seen

58
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:43,409
them at a public gathering seen them out

59
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:45,989
of the county fair with or eating hot

60
00:02:43,409 --> 00:02:48,989
dogs whatever they got going on have you

61
00:02:45,989 --> 00:02:51,870
been to their offices have you written

62
00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:54,390
an email or made a phone call these are

63
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:57,750
the things that all the individual

64
00:02:54,389 --> 00:03:00,988
voices can do to effect change you know

65
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:04,709
there's money at play in this there's

66
00:03:00,989 --> 00:03:06,239
there's money in keeping it illegal you

67
00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:08,250
know there's there's a lot of fines that

68
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:11,069
go out people you know you smoked out in

69
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:13,979
public you can get a ticket and you know

70
00:03:11,068 --> 00:03:19,589
what the court system it's just a grind

71
00:03:13,979 --> 00:03:23,729
so we need to create safe access where

72
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:28,819
adults can meet and greet and entertain

73
00:03:23,729 --> 00:03:31,949
each other responsibly and socially and

74
00:03:28,819 --> 00:03:35,299
not be feel like criminals we shouldn't

75
00:03:31,949 --> 00:03:38,069
have to hide in the closet anymore so

76
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:39,989
