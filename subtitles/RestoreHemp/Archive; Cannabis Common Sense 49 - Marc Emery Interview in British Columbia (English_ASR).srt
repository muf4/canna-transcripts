29
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:40,680
trip up in Vancouver the police

30
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,680
basically ignore the marijuana laws and

31
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,600
uh they don't arrest people for smoking

32
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:47,079
marijuana there's several establishments

33
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:49,280
where people openly smoke marijuana and

34
00:01:47,078 --> 00:01:51,078

original proprietor of hemp BC yeah it's

38
00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:00,880

40

educational Mark Emery is a quite an

41
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:08,919
inspiration to everybody I think he's a

42
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:11,080
definitely unique individual um and he's

43
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:13,280
got his own points of view which are we

44
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:14,800
may all agree with all of them but um

45
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,640
he's got a vision and he followed his

46
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,120
vision I really like that fact that Mark

47
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:21,000

105
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:47,519
help us out I me we want to change the

106
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:48,959
entire culture here in Oregon that

107
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:52,519
surrounding hemp get rid of the

108
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:54,680
prohibition culture and go into the um a

109
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:56,959
much more of a regulation culture that's

110
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:59,478
like you know the first step to freedom

111
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:01,239
is to you know get rid of prohibition

112
00:04:59,478 --> 00:05:03,879
and and you know we want to just

113
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:05,600
regulate it the same as alcohol is you

114
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:08,680
know we would have it for recreational

115
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,320
use in state liquor stores um and that

116
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:12,199
would be I think a very good way of

117
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:13,759
doing it because there there's only you

118
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:16,240
know adults they check

119
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:18,600
IDs um and then you wouldn't have people

120
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,519
on playgrounds selling marijuana people

121
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:23,479
staying on the street corner selling it

122
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:25,758
it' just be much more of a pleasant

123
00:05:23,478 --> 00:05:28,038
atmosphere um and we would and the state

124
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,400
of course would raise money off of that

125
00:05:28,038 --> 00:05:31,759
and I think everybody would have a much

126
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:34,679
better time with it um and as you can

127
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,879
see up in Vancouver um there's such a

128
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:39,000
wonderful atmosphere up there there's a

129
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:41,879
great community and I hope that comes

130
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,199
through in the in the shows that we have

131
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:45,759
upcoming here the various interviews

132
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:49,439
that the people up there just really

133
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:51,400
know how to respect the plan um and then

134
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:53,478
therefore uh everybody's okay with it

135
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:55,239
the police are okay with it um it's

136
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:56,879
against the law there but the police say

137
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,918
Hey you know long as you're not

138
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:00,800
bothering anybody why should we bother

139
00:05:58,918 --> 00:06:02,519
you right right and that's the way it

140
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,759
should be so the first part of this

141
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:07,279
interview uh is with Mark Emory we want

142
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:10,319

145
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:16,120
a few radical things I don't know if

146
00:06:14,598 --> 00:06:18,279
we'll get into it this portion but of

147
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:21,478
course he has his own views and he's

148
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:23,959
really done a lot to uh change the

149
00:06:21,478 --> 00:06:26,879

00:07:03,038 --> 00:07:06,959
human freedom and liberty and nothing

167
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,598
more pressing than marijuana

168
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:12,038
legalization in that front but for the

169
00:07:08,598 --> 00:07:14,159
first 12 years uh from 1980 to 1992 I

170
00:07:12,038 --> 00:07:16,120
went to court in jail for many different

171
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,560
things uh opening my stores on Sunday

172
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:19,519
which we were convicted of and sent to

173
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:21,319
jail we used to sell everything that the

174
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:24,598
government banned so we went to court

175
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:27,800
and were convicted there and I during a

176
00:07:24,598 --> 00:07:29,240
municipal garbage strike in 1986 I

177
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:31,520
provided my own private garbage service

178
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:34,120
for free for the public picked up 72,000

179
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:35,439
lb of garbage just to basically uh show

180
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,720
people they shouldn't be helpless during

181
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:39,319
you know government strikes I mean I've

182
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,960
done all sorts of stuff but prior to uh

183
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:43,479
the marijuana legalization issue which I

184
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:46,439
really started in Earnest in around 1991

185
00:07:43,478 --> 00:07:47,758
mhm in ' 91 was that when you moved here

186
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:49,598
was that back actually that was in

187
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,280
Ontario we started selling illegal

188
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:52,439
banned books on marijuana I was shocked

189
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:53,878
to find that they were illegal but I

190
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:55,478
always wondered why High Times was never

191
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:56,759
on the news stands in Canada and why you

192
00:07:55,478 --> 00:07:58,318
couldn't buy any kind of material about

193
00:07:56,759 --> 00:08:00,199
marijuana and it's because Canada has a

194
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,680
law that basically

195
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:06,038
says anything that promotes Advocates or

196
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:08,759
in any way condones marijuana use um is

197
00:08:06,038 --> 00:08:11,360
illegal and subject to $100,000 fine and

198
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:13,319
that's on video or in printed form it

199
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,319
specifically points ask for marijuana no

200
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:16,439
it says any illegal drugs so you can't

201
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:17,639
promote any illegal drug and if

202
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:18,918
marijuana is illegal of course and this

203
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:21,038
the primary one I mean there's not a lot

204
00:08:18,918 --> 00:08:22,598
of people promoting LSD or heroin

205
00:08:21,038 --> 00:08:24,240
although there certainly is a lot of

206
00:08:22,598 --> 00:08:26,000
medical documentation that would also be

207
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,120
illegal in those areas too and of course

208
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,959
all books about the subject are illegal

209
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:32,120
etc etc and there are no EX iions and it

210
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:33,639
provides for $100,000 fine and or 6

211
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:36,278
months in jail and that's not a first

212
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:37,679
offense a second offense $300,000 so

213
00:08:36,278 --> 00:08:40,200
anyway there isn't any fine bigger than

214
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:41,679
the criminal code as it turns out and uh

215
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,839
that's all for books about marijuana so

216
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:44,838
anyway we started selling them but I

217
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:46,720
didn't get charged for that one they

218
00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:47,880
that was clearly unconstitutional so we

219
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,360
end up selling them in front of the

220
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:51,639
police station one day after a big press

221
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,320
conference and hundreds of people there

222
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:55,039
and they still wouldn't arrest me so

223
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:56,440
that was my history in Ontario and then

224
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:58,439
I went to Asia to live for a couple

225
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:02,399
years came back here in March of 94 and

226
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:04,680
founded HC on April 11th 1994 mhm and

227
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,600
then we really kicked up some dust mhm

228
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:09,278
yeah so what what is or at that time

229
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:11,800
what was hemp BC because um a lot of us

230
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:13,078
don't know what de time when I came here

231
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:15,159
there were no hemp stor there are no

232
00:09:13,078 --> 00:09:17,199
pipes or bongs all that's illegal um

233
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:18,838
there were no books about marijuana in

234
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,079
High Times magazine was illegal in all

235
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:23,560
of Canada and not distributed here for

236
00:09:21,078 --> 00:09:26,439
four or five years by that time and

237
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:28,239
there was nothing and so I knew there

238
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:30,120
must be a market there somewhere and

239
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,839
what I did is from April 11th through

240
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:34,320
July uh of that year I sold High Times

241
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:36,279
magazine and growstone door to door to

242
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,399
houses to people at bus stops to variety

243
00:09:36,278 --> 00:09:40,278
stores I sort of was a mini distributor

244
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,159
to about 4050 stores who were willing to

245
00:09:40,278 --> 00:09:43,399
handle it but by the way four fifths of

246
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:44,838
all the people approached in stores

247
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:47,600
refused to handle High Times because it

248
00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:49,240
was banned they said and so you know

249
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,320
human freedom and liberty is not alive

250
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:53,079
in the in the minds of most book sellers

251
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:55,200
but we did find some who'd sell it like

252
00:09:53,078 --> 00:09:57,278
here in there 5 10 20 copies and stuff

253
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,759
like that and that's what I did for 3

254
00:09:57,278 --> 00:10:00,600
months sold things door to door and then

255
00:09:58,759 --> 00:10:02,519
earned up my to start the to pay the

256
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,680
rent on the location at 324 West

257
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:06,879
Hastings which became the original HC

258
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:08,759
and where we were first rated and is now

259
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:10,399
the stop you here just for a second

260
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:12,078
where did you get the hemp times or the

261
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:13,519
High Times from oh we would just import

262
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:15,639
them they didn't stop them at custom

263
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,360
they stop at custom no no that that that

264
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:19,720
that law was not being enforced but the

265
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,278
fear factor involved in having a law

266
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,639
like that meaning you could be charged

267
00:10:21,278 --> 00:10:23,958
at any time meant that Distributors

268
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:26,159
wouldn't conventional Distributors

269
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:27,399
simply wouldn't handle it because the

270
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:29,078
the climate was also different in the

271
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:30,958
1980s and the Reagan Bush period you

272
00:10:29,078 --> 00:10:32,519
know people were easily scared off but

273
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:33,559
that started to thaw considerably

274
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:35,320
especially with the influence of the

275
00:10:33,559 --> 00:10:38,679
emperor wears no clothes in the late '

276
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:41,399
80s and early 90s and eventually uh we

277
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:42,799
did open on July 7th 1994 the HC store

278
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:45,120
which is now the HC Legal Assistance

279
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:46,799
Center that location MH and understand

280
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,959
that block was all boarded up when you

281
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:51,639
came to it and that it's bad block yeah

282
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:53,679
the exact location of where HC was

283
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:55,039
founded used to be a communist Albanian

284
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:57,078
Bookshop and it had been put out of

285
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:59,319
business when somebody torched it so the

286
00:10:57,078 --> 00:11:01,319
place was all fired and charred inside

287
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:03,200
and there was urine smells and urine all

288
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:05,519
it just was a filthy block and that was

289
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,040
one of the filthiest buildings and but

290
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,639
it was run by a guy who would be was

291
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:10,319
anxious to have anybody renovate the

292
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:12,720
place and fix it up and that's how we

293
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,079
got in in a seemingly controversial

294
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,320
business we had an Asian landlord and

295
00:11:14,078 --> 00:11:17,199
all my landlords are Asian for this

296
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:18,560
building all our stores because they

297
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,560
tend to only care if they get the rent

298
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:21,278
they don't really care about what you're

299
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:23,359
doing in that building and we really do

300
00:11:21,278 --> 00:11:24,600
renovate all the buildings extensively

301
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,079
all the properties we've ever been in

302
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:29,480
have been improved considerably so they

303
00:11:27,078 --> 00:11:30,958
benefited by that trust in us and and

304
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:33,159
from there though we launched a separate

305
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:36,039
grow shop down the street right after

306
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:38,039
the first rate in in January 96 we

307
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:40,000
opened the little grow shop 3 weeks

308
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:42,000
later just next door and then we

309
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,958
Consolidated those into the HBC super

310
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,639
store that you see now MH so what was

311
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:48,319
the initial reaction of the authorities

312
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:49,919
when you opened up the first hemp PC

313
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,879
store we never got any reaction I've

314
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:54,319
never yet had a complaint sent to me by

315
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:55,799
letter for form written form from the

316
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,920
city hall from anybody in fact I've

317
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:58,719
never had a complaint from the general

318
00:11:56,919 --> 00:12:00,199
public either and I used to work there

319
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,959
six days a week and I've never had a

320
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:03,200
single person say I don't agree with

321
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:05,039
what you're doing I've never had it it's

322
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,920
the least controversial Enterprise I've

323
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:08,240
ever started that's great to hear yeah

324
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:09,479
well you got to understand that

325
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,879
Vancouver and British Columbia are very

326
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:13,120
much a live andl lit Society the problem

327
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:15,679
is they don't get politicians that

328
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,399
reflect that that and uh and that's

329
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:19,359
typical because living live people don't

330
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:20,799
tend to go vote people who tend to vote

331
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,839
tend to be people with property vested

332
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:23,879
interests you know people from

333
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,000
Vancouver's West Side who have a lot of

334
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:26,240
wealthy property and they don't want

335
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,198
anything to change and they don't they

336
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,480
don't want to keep it white Caucasian

337
00:12:28,198 --> 00:12:31,958
and you know that old Vancouver people

338
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,399
who want the new Vancouver are the

339
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:35,399
immigrants the new people here the

340
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:36,799
movers and shakers young people people

341
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:38,679
who don't conventionally see any purpose

342
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:40,120
to voting and to a large degree they're

343
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:41,278
correct there is no real purpose to

344
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:43,000
voting but the problem is we're

345
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:45,720
victimized by the electoral process in

346
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,198
the absence of that so that's a problem

347
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:51,240
well what do you see the the future here

348
00:12:48,198 --> 00:12:53,719
in um Vancouver the city and the The

349
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:57,560
Province BC about democracy then if this

350
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:59,278
many people are flouting the law M and

351
00:12:57,559 --> 00:13:00,439
you know and they won't change the law I

352
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:02,519
mean is that going to have any sort of

353
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:03,959
impact on Democracy here you think well

354
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:05,440
ultimately you know politicians are like

355
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:07,278
a flock of seagulls they follow the

356
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,880
leader and the leader is public opinion

357
00:13:07,278 --> 00:13:10,278
and public opinion if it lingers long

358
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:13,078
enough in the One Direction will

359
00:13:10,278 --> 00:13:15,198
eventually permeate Society completely

360
00:13:13,078 --> 00:13:16,599
and all people will presume that that is

361
00:13:15,198 --> 00:13:18,359
the proper way to think and so things

362
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:20,320
going to happen in a very gradul way

363
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:22,320
without any like momentous decisions on

364
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,560
behalf of parliament or some some Old

365
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,560
Judge who you know is not going to

366
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:27,159
deliver Liberty to us because you know

367
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:28,638
we think we're due judges are very

368
00:13:27,159 --> 00:13:30,399
frightened old men really who've been

369
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:32,039
insulated behind a court bench for a lot

370
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:33,159
of their lives and don't really

371
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:35,120
understand the real world and aren't

372
00:13:33,159 --> 00:13:36,759
used to shaking things up in any proper

373
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,320
controversial way especially Canadian

374
00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:39,799
judges cing judges are particularly

375
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,160
conservative they like to think they've

376
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:42,399
got a heart of gold and sometimes they

377
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:43,360
do have a compassionate heart but

378
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,399
they're not they're not the kind of

379
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,120
people that are courageous enough to

380
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:47,399
change laws and you're not going to find

381
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:49,399
politicians I mean you have 3 million

382
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:52,078
pot smokers in the country about 15% of

383
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:53,759
the adult population perhaps even more I

384
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:55,559
mean you have clearly no one in favor of

385
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:56,720
prohibition in Canada any longer but

386
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:58,278
nonetheless you don't have a single

387
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,120
advocate for marijuana legalization in

388
00:13:58,278 --> 00:14:02,320
Parliament I mean not one single guy has

389
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:03,720
taken on the issue of civil liberties

390
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,560
for marijuana smokers even though you'll

391
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:07,199
find people in Parliament having the

392
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:09,000
same interest in homosexuals of whom

393
00:14:07,198 --> 00:14:10,359
there are far fewer in Canada and you'll

394
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,039
see the same people having the same

395
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,480
interest in First Nations or Chinese or

396
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:15,399
Asian people's rights and all of those

397
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:17,079
are legitimate but there's far fewer of

398
00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:19,320
each one of those groups in Canada than

399
00:14:17,078 --> 00:14:21,239
there are marijuana smokers and for some

400
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:24,040
reason we have been considered suitable

401
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:26,278
scapegoats like they have in America for

402
00:14:24,039 --> 00:14:27,439
60 years and there's no explanation ever

403
00:14:26,278 --> 00:14:29,120
offered like in Parliament they never

404
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,880
give an explanation so why we're keeping

405
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,000
prohibition nobody says yes we need to

406
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:35,240
criminalize a million Canadians and you

407
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,519
know arrest 100,000 every year and for

408
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:38,680
what purpose and you never get that

409
00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:40,120
answer you never get part two of the

410
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:41,479
opening premise like okay if we're

411
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:43,440
having this police dat what's the

412
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,839
explanation well we don't have one you

413
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:48,800
know and so it goes like that and that's

414
00:14:44,839 --> 00:14:50,800
most in incomprehensible well but isn't

415
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:53,078
it great what's going on up there Paul

416
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:54,639
in Vancouver British Columbia oh it's

417
00:14:53,078 --> 00:14:57,000
just fascinating what's going on up

418
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:59,600
there and you know we can do better here

419
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,159
um by getting our petition and getting

420
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,399

November and then come January 1 we

422
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:08,799

count out there as soon as possible

444
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,159
because we know it is everybody kind of

445
00:15:58,039 --> 00:16:01,879
hangs on to them sort of forgets about

446
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:04,039
them but you only have two or three

447
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:05,639
signatures on there send them in because

448
00:16:04,039 --> 00:16:07,078
they all count you know we've sent

449
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:09,399
thousands of those out there we've just

450
00:16:07,078 --> 00:16:12,879
got a tiny fraction of them in so we

451
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:15,679
urge you to send your petitions back in

452
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:18,318
we have to have them by the end of June

453
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:20,919
so if you have petitions send them back

454
00:16:18,318 --> 00:16:24,120
and if you need more give us a call at

455
00:16:20,919 --> 00:16:26,198
503 235

456
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:30,240
4606 if you're in the Portland area

457
00:16:26,198 --> 00:16:32,120
that's 235 4606 six so I guess we should

458
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,639
get back to that Mark Emory interview

459
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:35,318
you know it's just fascinating yeah it

460
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:37,720
is it's good to know that early history

461
00:16:35,318 --> 00:16:40,000
of how hemp BC started and how the whole

462
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:41,639
culture there started in community so I

463
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,318
think it's going to be great um watching

464
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:45,198
the rest of the interview and think

465
00:16:43,318 --> 00:16:47,639
about how we here in Oregon can do the

466
00:16:45,198 --> 00:16:50,639
same thing with all of our help so here

467
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:51,720
it is the Mark Emory hemp BC interview

468
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,799
thanks for

469
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:55,120
watching as long as we're moving towards

470
00:16:53,799 --> 00:16:56,719
Freedom then you're moving in a positive

471
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,120
direction and certainly since the time

472
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,800
I've been in here things have moved on

473
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:01,198
the marijuana issue a very positive

474
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:02,599
direction I mean you know when you

475
00:17:01,198 --> 00:17:04,000
consider that you couldn't buy a pipe in

476
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:06,400
this town you know and you couldn't buy

477
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,798
a book or magazine about marijuana and

478
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,280
you know I mean productivity has

479
00:17:07,798 --> 00:17:10,959
probably tripled since I've you know

480
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:12,599
been here in the last four years and

481
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,919
we've been on every major media which

482
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:15,198
was Unthinkable before they would never

483
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,360
think about putting a marijuana seed

484
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:18,480
dealer on the front page of the Wall

485
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:20,958
Street Journal and you know CNN the mass

486
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,558
media the Ted Turner you know uh Time

487
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,519
Warner corporate establishment giving me

488
00:17:22,558 --> 00:17:26,759
a great review on CNN or for that matter

489
00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:28,318
Rolling Stone the old the old hippies

490
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:29,558
and the new capitalist and rolling stone

491
00:17:28,318 --> 00:17:30,918
gave us an excellent review too we

492
00:17:29,558 --> 00:17:32,639
always get good reviews there's a daily

493
00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:34,840
paper you've got article from two days

494
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,320
ago another great full page article

495
00:17:34,839 --> 00:17:38,439
they're always great reviews the media

496
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:40,558
is completely on side in a lot of issues

497
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:42,279
when they interview me it comes out fine

498
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:43,839
I always ask them whenever you do a grow

499
00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:45,440
bust you know you always take these cops

500
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:47,119
press releases and say you know four

501
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,120
hydroponic operations or seed why don't

502
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:50,038
you ask them what their moral

503
00:17:48,119 --> 00:17:51,599
justification for that is if resources

504
00:17:50,038 --> 00:17:53,599
are short how can you justify chasing

505
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:55,319
down any marijuana growers when we know

506
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:57,158
it's harmless when everybody in British

507
00:17:55,319 --> 00:17:58,399
Columbia approves of it when two-thirds

508
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:00,080
have clearly got on record saying they

509
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,440
don't think marijuana should be illegal

510
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,918
why do you waste anybody's time why do

511
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,519
you destroy people's lives why do you

512
00:18:02,919 --> 00:18:06,600
violate their civil rights why do you

513
00:18:04,519 --> 00:18:07,839
continue this police state for nothing

514
00:18:06,599 --> 00:18:09,480
they never asked that question they

515
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:11,319
can't get up the nerve to ask the cops

516
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:12,919
that question but if every every

517
00:18:11,319 --> 00:18:14,079
journalist asked the cop that question

518
00:18:12,919 --> 00:18:15,640
every time there was a girl raid you'd

519
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:17,678
see them drop they just wouldn't want to

520
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:19,159
get gred anymore you know you wouldn't

521
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:21,280
and then people who are raided would

522
00:18:19,159 --> 00:18:22,559
call the press to alert them and the

523
00:18:21,279 --> 00:18:23,798
relationship would be reversed they'd

524
00:18:22,558 --> 00:18:25,519
call them say I've just been violated

525
00:18:23,798 --> 00:18:27,240
and these people would record their

526
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:29,038
point of view instead it's repeatedly

527
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:32,120
always the police point of view just

528
00:18:29,038 --> 00:18:33,558
print the police um news bolt in verb

529
00:18:32,119 --> 00:18:35,199
yeah now they're a little more inqu

530
00:18:33,558 --> 00:18:36,359
inquisitive here because they know that

531
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,080
the most of the population is not

532
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:39,959
supportive of this marijuana War the

533
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:42,000
police are waging but you know the media

534
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:44,440
could do a lot more to accelerate the

535
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
liberation of several million people and

536
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:47,960
most of the reporters are on side it's

537
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,279
again the older editorial staff the

538
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,919
people who have more corporate interest

539
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:53,200
in mind would like to tread a fine line

540
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:54,880
between supporting the police as

541
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,798
everybody has to knee- yourk do so in a

542
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,240
corporate you know democracy like we

543
00:18:56,798 --> 00:18:59,480
have here everybody has to say you know

544
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,400
the police May done something it's not

545
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:02,159
like we're against the police for

546
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,880
anything blah blah blah even though they

547
00:19:02,159 --> 00:19:05,520
know they've been like ruining lives and

548
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:07,360
families in this unnecessary drug work

549
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:08,960
for their own self-interest you know for

550
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:10,599
the last two decades I mean sure

551
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,960
politicians Inspire them but cops can

552
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:13,558
tell them to [ __ ] off really we got

553
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:15,558
better things to do and no one would say

554
00:19:13,558 --> 00:19:17,000
boo about marijuana but cops do it

555
00:19:15,558 --> 00:19:19,200
because a lot of people thousands of

556
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,919
Canadians for example 2,000 cops are

557
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,798
employed every eight hour shift to just

558
00:19:20,919 --> 00:19:24,600
chase down marijuana so if they made

559
00:19:22,798 --> 00:19:25,879
marijuana illegal tomorrow you got 6,000

560
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:27,798
guys right there who are immediately

561
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:29,039
super and probably 10 or 20,000 other

562
00:19:27,798 --> 00:19:30,240
cops I mean if you didn't have a drug

563
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:31,640
war at all you would need half the

564
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,558
police officers in North America that

565
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:36,400
you've got today oh yeah absolutely

566
00:19:34,558 --> 00:19:38,119
fraction of the prisons yeah exactly I

567
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,280
mean exactly fraction of pris and you'd

568
00:19:38,119 --> 00:19:42,079
have a great increase in society safety

569
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:44,119
see prohibition accomplishes the exact

570
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:46,119
opposite of every stated aim it raises

571
00:19:44,119 --> 00:19:48,000
the price of Marijuana or drugs or all

572
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:50,279
drugs so that you and I the consumer

573
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,480
have to spend more of that on our

574
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:54,119
supplies as opposed to our children or

575
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,360
education or buying a new computer or a

576
00:19:54,119 --> 00:19:56,798
home or investing in the economy or

577
00:19:55,359 --> 00:19:58,918
starting our own business a lot of our

578
00:19:56,798 --> 00:20:01,319
money goes to the herbs and and drugs we

579
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:04,400
seek it encourages police corruption

580
00:20:01,319 --> 00:20:06,000
armed uh Crim gangs it destabilizes at

581
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,320
least 15 to 20 foreign governments in

582
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,919
the world right now whole countries are

583
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:12,079
in total D stabilization because of a US

584
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:14,480
drug war in South and Central America

585
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:16,558
you've got uh whole Aid programs geared

586
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,919
on whether they have a crop eradication

587
00:20:16,558 --> 00:20:19,759
program going on in that particular

588
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:21,799
Community like India or Bangladesh

589
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:23,240
you've got um you know organized crime

590
00:20:21,798 --> 00:20:25,319
profiting because it's illegal you've

591
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:26,798
got biker gangs you've got you've got

592
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:28,319
police corruption you've got people

593
00:20:26,798 --> 00:20:30,400
being shot dead in their homes during

594
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:32,279
raid you've got every kind of civil

595
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,000
liberty disab from urine testing to kids

596
00:20:32,279 --> 00:20:36,119
riding on you at school to parents

597
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,720
riding on their kids I mean it's a whole

598
00:20:36,119 --> 00:20:39,399
terrible system we' fostered with this

599
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,919
drug war and not a good thing has come

600
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,840
of it it's destroyed everything that's

601
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:46,440
supposedly held dear in America Freedom

602
00:20:42,839 --> 00:20:48,639
privacy Liberty money uh Law and Order

603
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:51,320
uh clean government prohibition ruins it

604
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:53,120
all well I mean I think the one that one

605
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:54,359
yeah one that we really lost in America

606
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:56,399
I don't know how how you guys are going

607
00:20:54,359 --> 00:20:58,279
here but a right to you be free from

608
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,840
search and seizure in America I mean

609
00:20:58,279 --> 00:21:01,119
when I was was a kid growing up that was

610
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:03,000
you know always held up to be one of our

611
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:04,959
greatest ones we don't have that here in

612
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,240
Canada really there's no privacy or you

613
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,679
know cops do what they want you know the

614
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:10,319
thing is they tend to be politer about

615
00:21:08,679 --> 00:21:12,919
it's friendly fascism you know in a

616
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:14,200
sense but uh but then you know I should

617
00:21:12,919 --> 00:21:15,278
talk so on one hand if I were in the

618
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,679
United States I'd be in jail for the

619
00:21:15,278 --> 00:21:19,798
next 20 years so right you know so you

620
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:21,080
know I've got 17 counts including nine

621
00:21:19,798 --> 00:21:22,839
trafficking and I'm still walking I

622
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:24,278
don't know how long that'll last but you

623
00:21:22,839 --> 00:21:26,038
know I'm still out on the street even if

624
00:21:24,278 --> 00:21:27,880
they barred me from my own businesses

625
00:21:26,038 --> 00:21:29,480
and for forced me at gunpoint to sell

626
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:31,080
them the fact as all of it still

627
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:32,640
basically exists except I'm not allowed

628
00:21:31,079 --> 00:21:34,199
to own it you've got to be flexible you

629
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,919
can't go on that block yeah you can't go

630
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,200
on that block well these are

631
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:37,480
revolutionary times and for a

632
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:39,759
revolutionary to still be allowed on the

633
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:42,079
street not shot dead maybe I should be

634
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:44,640
grateful yeah yeah so what kind of legal

635
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:46,199
charges are you facing well we've got uh

636
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,640
eight counts of trafficking from two

637
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:50,360
different uh times and most recently the

638
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,159
one that got me barred from my own store

639
00:21:50,359 --> 00:21:53,599
is allegedly and this usually I get

640
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:55,240
charged by the way after I do a major

641
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:57,158
national interview of some kind or we

642
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:59,240
get raided or something like that and I

643
00:21:57,159 --> 00:22:00,080
was on the Vicky gabo show live for 25

644
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:02,000
minutes

645
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:03,558
Nationwide and then the next the later

646
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
on the day I got served with I was put

647
00:22:03,558 --> 00:22:07,839
in jail I tried for two counts of

648
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,599
trafficking marijuana and hashish and

649
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:11,599
apparently two months earlier some

650
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:13,319
Americans had come up to my Cafe a man

651
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:15,240
and his three daughters and I allegedly

652
00:22:13,319 --> 00:22:17,038
got them high allegedly gave them a gift

653
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:18,640
of $5 worth of hash which would be about

654
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:20,720
that much I guess half a gram a quarter

655
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,278
of a gram and they went back to United

656
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,519
States and they got caught with it and

657
00:22:22,278 --> 00:22:26,519
they said Mark emry gave it to us and

658
00:22:24,519 --> 00:22:28,278
they were let go and but you don't

659
00:22:26,519 --> 00:22:30,200
really recall this happened oh God no I

660
00:22:28,278 --> 00:22:31,679
mean it could well just be a story they

661
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:33,480
say oh Mark oh yeah well I find it

662
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:34,798
fantastic that it's even you can use

663
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,960
that I mean that way what about the guy

664
00:22:34,798 --> 00:22:37,558
who's caught with a big truck full of

665
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:40,240
pot he can just hey Marky told me to

666
00:22:37,558 --> 00:22:42,558
deliver this billinton yeah or the mayor

667
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:44,200
Vancouver but anyway so they sent this

668
00:22:42,558 --> 00:22:45,399
back to Vancouver and they sat on it for

669
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,519
six s weeks and then all of a sudden

670
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,960
right after did that interview they

671
00:22:46,519 --> 00:22:49,359
chared to move two counts of trafficking

672
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:50,798
and there's no witness because they're

673
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:53,479
not coming back here to testify there's

674
00:22:50,798 --> 00:22:54,679
no hash no cop ever saw and not and the

675
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:56,599
only person who took a statement is an

676
00:22:54,679 --> 00:22:58,080
American Immigration officer so it's not

677
00:22:56,599 --> 00:22:59,798
even within the legal jurisdiction of

678
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:01,158
Canada that anything is alleged to have

679
00:22:59,798 --> 00:23:02,359
happened with any but the thing is they

680
00:23:01,159 --> 00:23:04,200
charge me and we don't come to trial

681
00:23:02,359 --> 00:23:05,918
till next December so for the whole year

682
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,640
so anyway they put me in jail so that's

683
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:09,480
what that's what led to you not being

684
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:11,120
able to visit yeah because they they put

685
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:12,720
me in jail and they said listen if you

686
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:14,000
don't agree to never go back to the 300

687
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,159
block you have to sign this agreement

688
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,919
undertaking and and the failure to obey

689
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:20,520
it is indefinite imprisonment right then

690
00:23:18,919 --> 00:23:21,480
we're not letting you out we're going to

691
00:23:20,519 --> 00:23:23,000
ask him to hold you in because you've

692
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:25,278
already got tons of trafficking charges

693
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,640
and you know and so I had to agree to it

694
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:29,000
or they would never let me out for

695
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,759
months and months so now if I'm uh go in

696
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,038
the block where my old shops are are

697
00:23:30,759 --> 00:23:35,000
then I would go to jail indefinitely

698
00:23:32,038 --> 00:23:35,000
until it comes up at TR in

699
00:23:35,319 --> 00:23:40,879
December isn't that great what's going

700
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:42,640
on up there in Vancouver once again I'll

701
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,520
have to say it's fabulous I mean it's

702
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:46,440
just so interesting you know Mark Embry

703

704
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:50,720

705
00:23:48,359 --> 00:23:53,959
our rights up there and pioneering

706
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:55,440
things uh with direct Civil Disobedience

707
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:57,240
yeah exactly I mean from what he started

708
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:59,960
off with just like selling banned books

709
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:01,440
and banned magazines to saying okay

710

711
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:06,400
utensils to a multi-million dollar

712
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:09,519
Enterprise with 43 employees he just

713
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:11,278
pulled himself up by his bootstraps uh

714
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:13,440
basically going door to-door selling

715
00:24:11,278 --> 00:24:15,240
magazines and using that to open his

716
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,720
businesses yeah I mean that that's kind

717
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:18,120
of interesting you going from shop to

718
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,480

to take couple cop magazine that can get

720
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,240
you busted you know and it's just and it

721
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:26,320
was quite um impressive how we did it

722
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,000
like I say I mean the man he had a

723
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:30,678
vision and he followed it and he got

724
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,880
there um and I think you know we here

725
00:24:30,679 --> 00:24:36,000
have a vision in Oregon right and that

726
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:38,760
is to completely legalize and regulate

727
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:41,119
adult sales of marijuana to allow people

728
00:24:38,759 --> 00:24:43,519
to grow their own to license Farmers to

729
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:46,000
grow the crop commercially to allow

730
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:47,558
medical patients to access marijuana

731
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,240
through pharmacies with the doctor's

732
00:24:47,558 --> 00:24:51,839
prescription and to allow Farmers

733
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:54,359
without a license to cultivate

734
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:56,359
Industrial Hemp to produce thousands of

735
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:58,759
