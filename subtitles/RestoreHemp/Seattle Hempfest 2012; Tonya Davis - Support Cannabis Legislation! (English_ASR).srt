1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,919
know I want to personally thank every

2
00:00:02,158 --> 00:00:07,718
one of you for coming out today and

3
00:00:04,919 --> 00:00:11,120
yesterday and on

4
00:00:07,719 --> 00:00:13,919
Friday because this taste of

5
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:17,519
Freedom you can't get anywhere else

6
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:21,278
right I mean this is just

7
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:23,960
amazing so I want yall to appreciate

8
00:00:21,278 --> 00:00:26,839
that because I'm from

9
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:29,439
Ohio and we don't get this kind of

10
00:00:26,839 --> 00:00:30,599
Freedom so this is like going into a

11
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,320
Time War

12
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:35,079
you

13
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:38,079
know

14
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:40,480
okay I want to put my two cents in on

15
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,600
something and and I'm and I'm risking my

16
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:45,159
life here I'm sure because it's such a

17
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:48,879
passionate debate and I and I don't mean

18
00:00:45,159 --> 00:00:51,198
that in a bad way you guys need

19
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:55,079
to support

20
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:58,159
anything that's going to bring things

21
00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:01,920
forward now what I I know the patients

22
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:01,919
aren't happy with 502

23
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:08,319
but y'all C can take out the bad stuff

24
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,960
it's just something else to fight about

25
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:13,719
and fight

26
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:16,519
for but if we can stop the caging

27
00:01:13,719 --> 00:01:20,280
up of

28
00:01:16,519 --> 00:01:23,560
everyone for making a

29
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:25,478
choice that's progress now you're going

30
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:28,040
to have the cops that are going to be

31
00:01:25,478 --> 00:01:29,879
going out there and are going to be

32
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:32,560
doing their thing and make and break

33
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:36,719
breaking the law themselves by harassing

34
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:39,600
the patients and the sick that happens

35
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:42,920
everywhere but what we can do is go

36
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:47,039
after those police

37
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:49,680
officers and try to protect our

38
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:53,320
patients you know understanding and

39
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:58,079
compassion is what this movement is

40
00:01:53,319 --> 00:02:01,038
about so I don't say support or don't

41
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:03,438
support I say your

42
00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:05,320
conscience but don't be so hard on the

43
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:08,038
folks that either support it or don't

44
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:09,959
support it because we all have to be on

45
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:14,518
the same

46
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:16,680
side now Ohio had some very good news we

47
00:02:14,519 --> 00:02:19,680
just had

48
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:22,640
a our paraphernalia laws got dropped

49
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:25,360
down to uh a

50
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:27,399
misdemeanor see in Ohio we probably got

51
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:30,160
one of the best well at least one of the

52
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:33,800
top three

53
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:37,318
uh best marijuana laws in the country

54
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:39,480
we're allowed to have up to 99 G and

55
00:02:37,318 --> 00:02:41,958
it's $100

56
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:45,919
ticket but now if you have it in a

57
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:48,920
baggie or you have the papers to roll it

58
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:52,119
you're going to jail don't pass

59
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:55,359
go uh which was kind of backwards but

60
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:58,560
our legislator stepped up to the plate

61
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,760
and they have lowered the penalties the

62
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:05,239
same as marijuana

63
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:06,840
use or possession so I think that's

64
00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:11,120
amazing

65
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:13,959
um I've been an activist for over 10

66
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:17,000
years I uh stand up

67
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:20,479
for patience and everyone alike you know

68
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,878
I started out and this was just about

69
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:25,639
Tanya but now it's been so much it's

70
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:27,479
about the world now you know but you

71
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:30,399
don't know that when you first go into

72
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:33,438
it

73
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:36,319
last August I found out that uh there's

74
00:03:33,438 --> 00:03:39,400
nothing that our doctors can do for

75
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:42,798
me I found out I've got massive calcium

76
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:45,640
deposits on my brain all over my

77
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:48,200
brain these calcium deposits are on the

78
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:49,958
very important parts of your brain so I

79
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:53,560
get to look forward to a

80
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:56,280
stroke I get to look forward to uh heart

81
00:03:53,560 --> 00:04:00,479
attacks I get to look forward to

82
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:00,479
dementia and Alzheimer's

83
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:07,360
this disease by my doctors telling me

84
00:04:04,598 --> 00:04:08,039
how very sick I was it's actually pissed

85
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,760
me

86
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:13,438
off you know my doctor I don't care what

87
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:14,919
state I'm in that I'm living in if

88
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:18,478
that's home that's home I'm you're not

89
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:21,839
going to run me out of my home for

90
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:24,039
making a choice to try to fight for my

91
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:25,959
life if there is nothing that the

92
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:29,319
doctors can do for

93
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:30,560
me and our government has patents on

94
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:31,759
this

95
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:36,079
oh my

96
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:40,120
gosh our government has patents on Canan

97
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:40,120
aboid as

98
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:44,319
antioxidants and

99
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:46,159
neuroprotectants so don't you think that

100
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:48,079
puts me in a pretty good position

101
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,840
because you know what nobody's going to

102
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:53,918
take me out like a

103
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:56,359

105
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:01,960

110
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,079
