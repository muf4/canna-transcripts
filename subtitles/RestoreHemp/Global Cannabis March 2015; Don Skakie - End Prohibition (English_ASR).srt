1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,099
hey Portland how are you

2
00:00:04,318 --> 00:00:08,400
hey we've been yes all the time every

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:10,740
time we do an initiative we want you to

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,138
vote Yes yes yes all the time for

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:15,419
cannabis but I gotta tell you we got

6
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:17,579
some problems up in Washington they're

7
00:00:15,419 --> 00:00:22,500
the very problems I talked about on this

8
00:00:17,579 --> 00:00:25,379
stage this time last year and that is in

9
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:27,660
Washington state our legislature has

10
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:31,739
just passed a law that will end medical

11
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:34,280
access as we know it and require that

12
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:36,659
patients that don't grow for themselves

13
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:39,899
obtain their medicine from the state

14
00:00:36,659 --> 00:00:43,019
licensed recreational shops that allow

15
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:45,660
any of up to 200 pesticides in that

16
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:47,219
product now that may be okay for a

17
00:00:45,659 --> 00:00:49,319
recreational consumer that may be

18
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:51,920
healthy I don't know what the levels are

19
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:54,359
but I'm here to tell you

20
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,579
pesticides are not medicine for any sick

21
00:00:54,359 --> 00:01:00,238
person

22
00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:04,799
we have filed referendum 76 in

23
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:08,340
Washington state but now it's not yes we

24
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:11,400
want to tell them no the legislature has

25
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:15,420
passed this law no

26
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:18,000
the governor signed this law no

27
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:21,540
putting patients in with recreational

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,579
consumers to compete

29
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:25,979
for with with somebody that wants to get

30
00:01:23,579 --> 00:01:29,158
high so that you can be well and at an

31
00:01:25,978 --> 00:01:31,379
exorbitant price we say no they want us

32
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:33,118
to lower our plant limits which are

33
00:01:31,379 --> 00:01:35,640
already half of what was originally

34
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:38,819
recommended for any patient to provide

35
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:42,659
for themselves on down to four to six

36
00:01:38,819 --> 00:01:45,118
plants we say no we have legalized the

37
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:47,759
ounce for anybody to have

38
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:50,938
but now they want patience to be on a

39
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,618
registry and we say no and the reason

40
00:01:50,938 --> 00:01:54,779
for that is because we register one

41
00:01:52,618 --> 00:01:57,060
thing in Washington State

42
00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:00,359
sex offenders and we're not sex

43
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:02,219
offenders there is no reason there's no

44
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:05,840
valid reason

45
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:08,639
to put patients on a registry anymore

46
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:11,420
you know in Oregon you guys did it

47
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:15,179
before medical and that helped establish

48
00:02:11,419 --> 00:02:19,139
your your legal framework we have been

49
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:21,900
fighting since 1998 to get improvements

50
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:24,179
for patients and we've gotten forward

51
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:26,219
we've gotten forward and now we seem to

52
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:29,040
be going backwards

53
00:02:26,219 --> 00:02:32,300
the fight is on for medical

54
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:35,400
you know compassion is where

55
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:36,959
provider will just give medicine to

56
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,659
someone in need

57
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,519
I don't see that happening in a in a

58
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:44,939
for-profit business

59
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:47,459
and when you whatever you pay you are

60
00:02:44,939 --> 00:02:49,620
paying an exorbitant tax you're putting

61
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:51,239
this tax on the very people that can at

62
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:54,239
least affect it

63
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:57,000
you you put this tax on and people are

64
00:02:54,239 --> 00:03:00,060
going to have a choice of getting less

65
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,400
medicine or going right back to the back

66
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:04,739
alleys and black market and that is

67
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,620
where we were it is not where we want to

68
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:10,378
be and we refuse to be there

69
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:12,900
we must keep medical legitimate

70
00:03:10,378 --> 00:03:15,598
I've already had commitments of

71
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:19,019
thousands of dollars a piece all right

72
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:20,939
I'm in for a thousand Buck Paul Stanford

73
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:23,219
has said he's down for a thousand

74
00:03:20,939 --> 00:03:24,840
dollars a thousand dollars a thousand

75
00:03:23,219 --> 00:03:28,080
dollars a thousand dollars we're going

76
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:31,200
to add it up our patients are energized

77
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:34,560
our paper to uh get this referendum on

78
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:36,780
the ballot will be out uh May 17th 18th

79
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,658
right around there we'll go live and our

80
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:41,580
patients will do a wonderful job

81
00:03:38,658 --> 00:03:44,519
collecting signatures and educating the

82
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:47,580
public on why they want to vote no

83
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:50,219
on referendum 76.

84
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:53,340
but we won't be able to do that alone

85
00:03:50,219 --> 00:03:56,098
we need our community we need all the

86
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:59,098
Growers that grow medical we need all

87
00:03:56,098 --> 00:04:02,039
the access points that provide for

88
00:03:59,098 --> 00:04:04,199
patients we need all the authorizing

89
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:07,019
Physicians that do a wonderful job

90
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:09,298
picking up the slack of the other

91
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:11,719
providers that refuse to provide

92
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:14,819
authorizations for our patients in need

93
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:16,798
we need a thousand dollars from each one

94
00:04:14,818 --> 00:04:19,379
of these entities and we need it for

95
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:22,259
every quarter through this campaign it's

96
00:04:19,379 --> 00:04:24,478
going to cost about 240 thousand dollars

97
00:04:22,259 --> 00:04:25,439
to collect the signatures if we do

98
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:27,899
nothing

99
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:29,300
will cost less than that but we need

100
00:04:27,899 --> 00:04:33,359
that money

101
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:36,960
502 which promised us they told us they

102
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:39,479
told us over and over and over again 502

103
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:42,478
will not affect medical medical patients

104
00:04:39,478 --> 00:04:44,939
will not be affected by 502 and now they

105
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:47,758
want to put us right in that system it

106
00:04:44,939 --> 00:04:51,418
was all a lie it was a grab for power

107
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:54,419
and money and control they have gone

108
00:04:51,418 --> 00:04:56,659
from arresting us to taking our wallets

109
00:04:54,418 --> 00:05:02,939
right out of our hands

110
00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:05,340
no no on r76 will save safe access in

111
00:05:02,939 --> 00:05:07,319
Washington state it is going to

112
00:05:05,339 --> 00:05:10,439
Galvanize our community as it never has

113
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:12,300
before and it will enable us to have our

114
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:16,019
discussions as a community moving

115
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:20,040
forward so that we can create reasonable

116
00:05:16,019 --> 00:05:22,139
regulations that codify the services we

117
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:26,520
provide to patients now

118
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:28,819
we have an estimated five to eight

119
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:31,500
hundred access points across Washington

120
00:05:28,819 --> 00:05:33,180
can you imagine how many people that's

121
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:37,879
serving right now

122
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:39,780
the 502 system has roughly 60 plus

123
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:40,978
licensed stores and they're not all

124
00:05:39,779 --> 00:05:42,839
opened yet

125
00:05:40,978 --> 00:05:45,478
they can't even serve the recreational

126
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:47,879
demand they have now how are they going

127
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:50,399
to serve thousands of patients that have

128
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:52,800
almost daily needs

129
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:55,319
I I don't understand what the thinking

130
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,720
was but we're gonna straighten them out

131
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:59,879
we're going to get this done we're gonna

132
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:02,100
get it on the ballot we're gonna pass it

133
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:05,120
in November and then we're gonna stand

134
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:09,539
up as a community and tell the

135
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:12,538
legislators what to do right we need

136
00:06:09,538 --> 00:06:15,959
this to be right we need medical to be

137
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:18,899
separate from recreational if you don't

138
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:20,879
do that Friday is going to come and the

139
00:06:18,899 --> 00:06:22,620
patient's going to have a Payday and

140
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:24,659
he's going to walk on down to that store

141
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:27,240
and be willing to pay that high tax

142
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:29,100
because he's sick and he needs his

143
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:31,079
medicine and you know what's going to

144
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:32,879
happen he's going to find out that

145
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:35,339
Johnny's got a party tonight and he

146
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:37,860
bought up all that supply of that very

147
00:06:35,339 --> 00:06:40,279
strain that he needs to be well simply

148
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:45,600
so Johnny and his buddies could get high

149
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:48,258
no no on r76.org

150
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:51,000
I'm sorry

151
00:06:48,259 --> 00:06:53,060
r76no.org is our website and we'll be

152
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,519
going live probably Monday or Tuesday

153
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:59,399
it'll be public information it'll be

154
00:06:56,519 --> 00:07:02,399
volunteer opportunities and sign ups and

155

ended up with seed to sell but

160
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:20,279

161
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:21,659
free the plant free the people promote

162
