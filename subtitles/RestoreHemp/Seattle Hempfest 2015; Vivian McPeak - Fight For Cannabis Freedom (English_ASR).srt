1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,879
when it comes to prohibition you have

2
00:00:01,409 --> 00:00:07,169
the right not to remain silent and

3
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:11,000
that's why we do sell hempfest no man

4
00:00:07,169 --> 00:00:14,419
I've guns or tanks or jails or prisons

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:19,198
ever going to stop the march of freedom

6
00:00:14,419 --> 00:00:20,640
and the song of justice because with all

7
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:24,150
the warts and all problems that we have

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:26,699
here nine states of america us americans

9
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:30,118
we love our freedom we love our liberty

10
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:32,939
and by golly we haven't got enough of it

11
00:00:30,118 --> 00:00:34,289
yet about ten years ago we used to hear

12
00:00:32,939 --> 00:00:37,349
this theme of terrorists hate us for our

13
00:00:34,289 --> 00:00:40,170
freedom I'm not necessarily sure that's

14
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:41,579
true but our answer as well if they hate

15
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:44,670
us for our freedom to let's really piss

16
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:48,210
them off and give us some more let's

17
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:50,429
legalize cannabis for real and that

18
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:54,049
means repeal prohibition on the federal

19
00:00:50,429 --> 00:00:56,519
level that doesn't mean highly tax it

20
00:00:54,049 --> 00:01:00,799
restrict patients closed down

21
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:05,280
dispensaries that doesn't mean his tests

22
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:09,390
be discriminated at your job that's not

23
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:11,728
our original legalization last year we

24
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:13,769
had two adult lounge is here out of

25
00:01:11,728 --> 00:01:17,039
public view we're children couldn't see

26
00:01:13,769 --> 00:01:18,599
people then stop the people 21 and over

27
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,330
to go behind the fence and smoke their

28
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:24,449
pot I love your kids don't we leave on

29
00:01:21,329 --> 00:01:28,530
the state but state legislature passed

30
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:30,900
2136 Senate bill 21 36

31
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:32,728
making it a class E felony I have any

32
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:35,609
place for the purpose using marijuana

33
00:01:32,728 --> 00:01:39,689
which means no marijuana clubs don't

34
00:01:35,609 --> 00:01:44,090
private clubs no pot parties nothing

35
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:46,408
like that that's not legalization folks

36
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:50,850
that's the state legislature that treats

37
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:53,670
cannabis like it's oxycontin every day I

38
00:01:50,849 --> 00:01:55,199
walk down the street the sidewalk people

39
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:59,579
smoking cigarettes like nothing with

40
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:01,070
impunity everywhere even though four

41
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:03,420
hundred thousand people die from

42
00:02:01,069 --> 00:02:05,579
directly from using cigarettes this year

43
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:09,349
in America 400,000 people directly from

44
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:11,729
their use even more for secondhand smoke

45
00:02:09,349 --> 00:02:13,620
drive down the street you see people in

46
00:02:11,729 --> 00:02:16,709
front of bars on the patios drinking

47
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:18,719
alcohol even though over 40,000 people

48
00:02:16,709 --> 00:02:19,769
die from alcohol-related illness who

49
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:22,409
knows how many people die from

50
00:02:19,769 --> 00:02:26,610
alcohol-related violence car accidents

51
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:29,759
suicides accidents but you can't smoke a

52
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:34,260
joint that sound like legalization to

53
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:36,780
you sure note to me that's why we're

54
00:02:34,259 --> 00:02:38,310
going to keep doing this and then you

55
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:41,489
know I've asked probably ten times for

56
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:43,049
the media this week well I have a hemp

57
00:02:41,489 --> 00:02:44,789

down at any time but over it now over in

63

chemotherapy and on having pot is not a

124
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:31,529
bad as being in a prison cell

125
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:32,939
and losing your freedom it's not as bad

126
