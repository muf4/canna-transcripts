1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,560
I think that if we win in Oregon and

2
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:07,838
they win in Colorado with amendment 64

3
00:00:05,559 --> 00:00:10,759
and you know a lot of us had problems

4
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:12,359
with Prop 19 and there were the

5
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:15,240
provisions of that there was some

6
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:18,160
dissension in California uh but our

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,640
opposition's going to look at 502 and if

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,480
it doesn't pass they're going to think

9
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:25,439
well that shows people aren't in favor

10
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:28,240
of marijuana legalization it won't talk

11
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,839
about the the specifics that patients

12
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:32,399
had a problem with or uh marijuana

13
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:34,840
growers have a problem with it'll just

14
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,840
be a defeat same way that Prop 19 was a

15
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:39,559
defeat but I think if all of those

16
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:42,440
initiatives pass it could be much akin

17
00:00:39,558 --> 00:00:45,599
to the fall of the Berlin wall or the

18
00:00:42,439 --> 00:00:48,119
top Ling of linen statue in Red Square

19
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:51,558
that the whole edifice of marijuana

20
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:51,558
prohibition will

21
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,840
crumble

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,480
so if that happens in five years we're

23
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:02,480
going to be talking about a huge new

24
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:05,399
industry several new Industries not just

25
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:07,519
one you know Steve D'Angelo and I both

26
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,400
were there at the Inception of the HP

27
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:12,399
industry in the early 90s and late 80s

28
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,000
as several other people here in the the

29
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,719
audience are have been as well I think

30
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,159
that the hip industry when it's freed of

31
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:23,039
the shackles and the economic artificial

32
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:26,079
barriers on prohibition I think that the

33
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:29,320
hemp industry will dwarf the Cannabis

34
00:01:26,078 --> 00:01:31,839
marijuana industry I think hemp fuel is

35
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:34,798
going to be the primary engine of that I

36
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:38,200
think hemp fiber is going to be a large

37
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:40,320
component we already see hemp food in in

38
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:43,478
most of the stores in a billion doll

39
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:46,199
industry it really is a trillion dollar

40
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:48,478
industry now you know in

41
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:51,879
1937

42
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:54,399
Popular Mechanics it said that uh it was

43
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:56,478
a billion doll industry it's a a

44
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,280
trillion dollar industry Now Dave cber

45
00:01:56,478 --> 00:02:01,078
is holding up a piece of hemp fiber

46
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:04,159
board he helped p ER the production of

47
00:02:01,078 --> 00:02:08,399
that at Washington State University back

48
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:12,360
in the 80s and so uh I think that when

49
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:15,239
we replace prochemical fuels with

50
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:17,000
biofuels particularly hip fuel that

51
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:18,439
instead of putting all our money into

52
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,639
you know the energy industry is the

53
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:23,280
world's largest industry currently it

54
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:26,039
goes to the chiks in Saudi Arabia the

55
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:29,199
despots in OPEC the corporatists in

56
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:32,560
Exxon and mobile and that money instead

57
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:34,280
of going into those folks uh uh pockets

58
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,920
and their Swiss bank accounts will go to

59
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:39,080
our farmers and our communities and just

60
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:41,359
realign our whole economy there'll be a

61
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:45,000
whole new set of problems of course but

62
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:47,640
I think that uh uh we're on the verge of

63
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,598
creating several new environmentally

64
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:53,199
sustainable Industries that'll change

65
00:02:49,598 --> 00:02:53,199
society and our whole economic

66
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,400
paradigm
