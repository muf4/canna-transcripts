1
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:25,960
feeling the

2
00:00:22,278 --> 00:00:28,559
feeling of something gone

3
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:33,039
wrong how do you

4
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:33,039
define what you can't

5
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:40,160
explain into the dragging

6
00:00:36,558 --> 00:00:42,679
on Hunger gnaws on

7
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:47,718
long and in

8
00:00:42,679 --> 00:00:47,719
self-defense long keeps gnawing

9
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,879
back sometimes the thoughts don't know

10
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,359
what to

11
00:00:52,878 --> 00:01:01,718
think and where I've been doesn't

12
00:00:56,359 --> 00:01:01,719
remember a thing about me

13
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,759
something strange going

14
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:11,079
on everything that had

15
00:01:06,759 --> 00:01:15,920
unraveled and now it's raveling back

16
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:15,920
into all I thought I'd

17
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:24,600
escaped and those places I don't want to

18
00:01:20,118 --> 00:01:31,920
go don't want could care less about any

19
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:31,919
of that not with its own need for a fix

20
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:39,519
looking at what's been done all I did

21
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:39,519
was go along for the

22
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:48,718
ride and a shadowing of

23
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:50,560
light flung to the edge collided with

24
00:01:48,718 --> 00:01:55,239
reality and

25
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,240
reality didn't even blink

26
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:16,839
those dreams marked by

27
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:18,878
scars the rampaging question is who

28
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:25,319
would want to scar a

29
00:02:18,878 --> 00:02:25,318
dream maybe it scars need dreams

30
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:33,680
too writing a shattering of breaking

31
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:38,080
into an echo of

32
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:41,680
Silence that bitter taste looks for

33
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,680
someone sweet

34
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:12,000
feeling the feeling of something gone

35
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:15,840
wrong how do you

36
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,479
define what you can't

37
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:23,120
explain in a shadowing of

38
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:25,518
light flung to the edge collided with

39
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:30,439
reality and

40
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:30,439
reality didn't even blink

41
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:36,639
on
