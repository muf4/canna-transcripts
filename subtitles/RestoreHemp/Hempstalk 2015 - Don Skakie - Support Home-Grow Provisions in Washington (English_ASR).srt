1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,849
we have no home grow in Washington State

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:08,460
get her down here anybody 21 and up

3
00:00:05,849 --> 00:00:11,638
getting out the four plants that's real

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:15,350
Eagle ization when you can grow it and

5
00:00:11,638 --> 00:00:19,740
give it away that's real Eagle ization

6
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:24,810
if i'm still in washington state forced

7
00:00:19,739 --> 00:00:27,629
to go to a store that has any of 271

8
00:00:24,809 --> 00:00:30,288
pesticides on it which is where they're

9
00:00:27,629 --> 00:00:33,988
trying to drive all the medical patients

10
00:00:30,289 --> 00:00:37,620
it's not really legalization you know

11
00:00:33,988 --> 00:00:41,039
our movement has come up quite a way and

12
00:00:37,619 --> 00:00:44,099
we made a lot of ground with medical but

13
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:45,600
it seems now that now thats recreational

14
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,750
legal and everybody sees a big pot of

15
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,670
gold that medical seems to be taking a

16
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:53,640
backseat seems to be getting rougher

17
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:56,730
treatment seems to be seen to be not

18
00:00:53,640 --> 00:01:00,000
legitimate and I thank goodness for the

19
00:00:56,729 --> 00:01:03,448
Oregon program that is so well at scotts

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,450
in your society here that it is still

21
00:01:03,448 --> 00:01:09,359
apart as a matter of fact of leads

22
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:11,790
recreational you have got to go to the

23
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:13,228
to the medical shop right now until we

24
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:15,900
can get our other people licensed

25
00:01:13,228 --> 00:01:19,618
washington did that exactly the opposite

26
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:23,340
way they gave licenses out to the rec

27
00:01:19,618 --> 00:01:25,829
people people that were medical we're

28
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:28,020
not as accepted and less down the road

29
00:01:25,829 --> 00:01:30,509
and right now they are trying to shut us

30
00:01:28,019 --> 00:01:32,849
down I work in a place called Northwest

31
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:36,390
cannabis market up in Seattle this is

32
00:01:32,849 --> 00:01:38,969
the place were 20 to 30 vendors seven

33
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:40,890
days a week quote our medicine in front

34
00:01:38,969 --> 00:01:43,978
of legitimate patients with cards across

35
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:46,649
earth and across our two markets in the

36
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:49,799
a.m Seattle and white center we just on

37
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:54,780
the fifteenth of September shut down our

38
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:56,950
Seattle market we have had 2.5 million

39
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:59,228
patient visits to our market

40
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:01,750
how do they want to serve our needs they

41
00:01:59,228 --> 00:02:03,879
want to eliminate your choice they want

42
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:06,609
to shove you into the store they want to

43
00:02:03,879 --> 00:02:09,159
tax you that's all it's about it's not

44
00:02:06,609 --> 00:02:10,929
about what's best for you or what's best

45
00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:14,169
for the people or best for the state

46
00:02:10,929 --> 00:02:16,000
it's our money and a power grab and I

47
00:02:14,169 --> 00:02:20,919
say to all of you in any other states

48
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:24,219
Ohio can you hear me don't forget the

49
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:27,848
people that got us here our growers are

50
00:02:24,219 --> 00:02:30,039
experts they know what they're doing you

51
00:02:27,848 --> 00:02:32,048
know this new crowd they're going to do

52
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:34,389
great because they got lots and lots of

53
00:02:32,049 --> 00:02:36,879
money behind them but I don't want to

54
00:02:34,389 --> 00:02:39,699
legalize pot at forty and fifty dollars

55
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:43,329
a gram taxed I want to legalize pot so

56
00:02:39,699 --> 00:02:47,018
it goes down to about two bucks a gram I

57
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:49,719
want it to be free I want to grow my 15

58
00:02:47,019 --> 00:02:52,030
plants and I want to give some to you

59
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:55,379
into you into you and I'll tell you

60
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:58,449
something when anybody can grow in

61
00:02:55,379 --> 00:03:01,030
Washington State that will be the best

62
00:02:58,449 --> 00:03:02,828
protection for any patient because it

63
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:06,699
will not only not be forced to go to a

64
00:03:02,829 --> 00:03:08,439
store where poison is not medicine they

65
00:03:06,699 --> 00:03:11,169
will be able to get their cannabis from

66
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:12,939
anyone they choose it may be your

67
00:03:11,169 --> 00:03:16,659
