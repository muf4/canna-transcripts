1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720
I'm John Lucien law for 20 and some

2
00:00:02,189 --> 00:00:05,370
marijuana law firm founded here in

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:07,230
Portland Oregon back in two thousand

4
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:08,370
seven we've been doing this for a long

5
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:10,019
time and we're going to have to keep

6
00:00:08,369 --> 00:00:11,699
doing until it's completely legal like

7
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:13,349
they said so what I want to tell

8
00:00:11,699 --> 00:00:15,509
everybody is we've made giant steps

9
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:16,710
we're getting there there's still a lot

10
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:18,359
of people out there who are suffering

11
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:20,550
we've got people who are still in prison

12
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:23,010
people who are still in jail in this

13
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:24,839
state and in other states we've got

14
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:27,480
people around who are getting arrested

15
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:29,820
still you can be 18 19 20 still get

16
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,528
arrested you can be growing more than

17
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,969
one plant and get arrested you can do so

18
00:00:31,528 --> 00:00:34,530
many things that will allow you to get

19
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:36,329
arrested or otherwise have to deal with

20
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:39,120
the police and so until the day comes

21
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:40,710
when community community policing where

22
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:42,089
the police your friends again where the

23
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:43,320
police are trying to help you where the

24
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:45,000
police are trying to give you directions

25
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,520
rather than see what's in your pocket

26
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,320
until that day comes I want you to

27
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,270
remember something and those words are

28
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,189
very clear they're all my lighters throw

29
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:55,050
my cards they're on my website they're

30
00:00:53,189 --> 00:00:56,849
on just about everything I own to the

31
00:00:55,049 --> 00:00:58,679
point that I think I could repeat it in

32
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:01,260
my sleep and so what I ask everybody to

33
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:03,570
do help yourself out learn this phrase

34
00:01:01,259 --> 00:01:05,429
this will save you I've had clients who

35
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:07,200
say themselves easily ten twenty thirty

36
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:08,729
thousand dollars by just saying these

37
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,500
magic words and they really are magic

38
00:01:08,728 --> 00:01:12,840
words the Supreme Court of the United

39
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:14,489
States says they're magic words and they

40
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,259
will get the police to leave you alone

41
00:01:14,489 --> 00:01:18,209
and if they don't and they do violate

42
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:20,159
your right so you've got recourse but if

43
00:01:18,209 --> 00:01:21,719
you don't say these words you can be in

44
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,090
a lot of trouble so what I want

45
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:26,700
everybody to do is say with me am I free

46
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:32,530
to go officer

47
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:35,280
if I am being detained I do not consent

48
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:35,280
to any searches

49
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:43,579
and I want to speak with my attorney

50
00:01:38,709 --> 00:01:49,879
prior to answering any questions those

51
00:01:43,578 --> 00:01:51,559
are magic words good luck thank you they

52
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:54,618
aren't magic words but what's important

53
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:56,390
about this is that the police they

54
00:01:54,618 --> 00:01:57,679
oftentimes can be your friends and I

55
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:59,239
don't want to disparage them because

56
00:01:57,679 --> 00:02:01,159
there's a lot of good cops do a lot of

57
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:02,718
good things and take care of us and they

58
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:05,030
help us out in a lot of ways but when it

59
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:06,559
comes to marijuana when it comes to drug

60
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:08,449
use when it comes to those sorts of

61
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,090
things the police are not your friends

62
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:13,009
okay and so what you've got to do is

63
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:16,069
you've got to stand up and it's not easy

64
00:02:13,009 --> 00:02:18,769
even if your voice shakes even if your

65
00:02:16,068 --> 00:02:21,229
body shakes even if you cry even if you

66
00:02:18,769 --> 00:02:23,659
have to sit down when you deal with the

67
00:02:21,229 --> 00:02:25,789
police you have to assert your rights

68
00:02:23,659 --> 00:02:27,949
because if you don't assert your rights

69
00:02:25,789 --> 00:02:30,620
you're going to end up in a jail cell

70
00:02:27,949 --> 00:02:32,839
you can end up in a cage they can take

71
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:34,489
your kids they can take your job they

72
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:36,799
can take your house they can take your

73
00:02:34,489 --> 00:02:38,719
card but what they can ultimately take

74
00:02:36,799 --> 00:02:40,370
them for so many people is so valuable

75
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:42,439
and something I'd fall for many years

76
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:44,480
for is your freedom I've watched my

77
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:47,810
friends die in cages that's not

78
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:50,629
hyperbole I've watched them I found out

79
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:53,599
that they're dead from a letter from the

80
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:55,669
department of justice okay I don't want

81
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:57,289
anyone here to ever suffer that I don't

82
00:02:55,669 --> 00:02:58,729
want anyone here to ever watch them try

83
00:02:57,289 --> 00:03:00,349
to take away their kids because you

84
00:02:58,729 --> 00:03:02,328
smoked a joint and they claim that

85
00:03:00,349 --> 00:03:04,039
you're an unfit parent what I want to do

86
00:03:02,329 --> 00:03:06,230
is I want to live in a world where

87
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:08,030
marijuana is treated appropriately where

88
00:03:06,229 --> 00:03:09,469
there's going to be some regulation

89
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:11,090
that's never going to be the case we're

90
00:03:09,469 --> 00:03:13,189
never going to live in the Utopia that I

91
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:14,509
wish we could live in but if we can live

92
00:03:13,189 --> 00:03:17,389
in a world where when you smoke

93
00:03:14,509 --> 00:03:20,298
marijuana it won't destroy your life for

94
00:03:17,389 --> 00:03:22,700
a year five years 10 years 20 30 40 or

95
00:03:20,299 --> 00:03:26,109
injure life that's the world I want to

96
00:03:22,699 --> 00:03:26,108
live in guys thank you
