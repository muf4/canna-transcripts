1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,160
and this hero died before he could see

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:08,440
the freedom which he fought for most of

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:10,240
his life our elders are dying every day

4
00:00:08,439 --> 00:00:13,518
and with them goes a knowledge that may

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:15,599
never be recovered forced some for their

6
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,439
entire lives to hide what they know

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,600
instead of sharing it with others for

8
00:00:17,439 --> 00:00:22,759
fear that others May seek to end their

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:26,720
lives to keep this information from the

10
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:28,480
general public education is the only way

11
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:30,678
to get the freedom we seek for this

12
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,039
plant and ourselves

13
00:00:30,678 --> 00:00:33,679
understanding will only come when the

14
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:35,878
people open their eyes to the

15
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:37,799
possibility that they have been misled

16
00:00:35,878 --> 00:00:40,039
by the media and certain corporations or

17
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:41,718
government organizations about the true

18
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:43,920
purposes of a naturally occurring

19
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:45,960
substance which had had a symbiotic

20
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,079
relationship with all life on Earth

21
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,439
until the

22
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:51,558
1930s discrimination and Prejudice

23
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:53,640
towards the cannabis plant and those who

24
00:00:51,558 --> 00:00:55,799
choose to us utilize its broad

25
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,799
applications will always exist if fear

26
00:00:55,799 --> 00:01:01,198
and ignorance are the only tools being

27
00:00:57,799 --> 00:01:03,679
used to fight our oppression

28
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:05,920
if you know me or have seen me around

29
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:08,680
I've usually got a camera uh that's kind

30
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:12,118
of what I do as an activist uh I go

31
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:15,118
places I meet people uh I participate in

32
00:01:12,118 --> 00:01:18,239
the global cannabis Community because

33
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:20,438
this is a global

34
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:24,280
Community uh which we are trying to

35
00:01:20,438 --> 00:01:26,758
represent here today as respectful and

36
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:28,920
informed group of concerned citizens

37
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:31,319
that want their opinions to be

38
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,759
recognized I have had a tremendous

39
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:35,478
opportunities over the last decade or so

40
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:38,159
which allowed me to travel to great

41
00:01:35,478 --> 00:01:39,519
places and meet even greater people I'd

42
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,280
like to thank the people and

43
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:43,078
organizations that helped me to reach

44
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,519
out and educate

45
00:01:43,078 --> 00:01:47,478
others although I've been involved with

46
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:49,359
many organizations and groups looking to

47
00:01:47,478 --> 00:01:53,118
forward the movement towards true

48
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:55,359
cannabis Freedom you know

49
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:56,438
like where it's growing on your parking

50
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:58,759
strip like

51
00:01:56,438 --> 00:02:01,879
roses uh I believe that individual

52
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:04,438
activism is the real key you don't need

53
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:07,039
to sign up with only one group of people

54
00:02:04,438 --> 00:02:09,919
you can find your way into multiple

55
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:12,520
channels of this beautiful plant and its

56
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:14,878
abilities I have always preached that
