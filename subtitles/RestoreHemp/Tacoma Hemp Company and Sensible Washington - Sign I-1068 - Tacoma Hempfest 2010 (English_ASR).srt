1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,719
up here we got two of the gentlemen

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,480
very very behind the i-1068 campaign for

3
00:00:04,719 --> 00:00:07,759
legalization of marijuana in washington

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,599
state this year

5
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:11,280
if you've seen any of these petitions

6
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:13,039
around or heard about this it's probably

7
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:14,399
because of one of these two guys or one

8
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:16,239
of the many hundreds of volunteers

9
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,560
across the state that are busting their

10
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:20,320
asses to get the signatures to do all

11
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:22,719
this all of you people that are out here

12
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:26,160
signing all these petitions for every

13
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:28,960
other petition outside of 1068 every one

14
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,759
of these guys is a paid signature gather

15
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,719
all of the 1068 signature gatherers are

16
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:37,200
unpaid volunteers and we have got

17
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:39,439
hundreds of thousands of signatures so

18
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,719
far without the financial incentive

19
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:43,119
behind it and that's because this is

20
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:45,679
what people want in this state in this

21
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:48,399
country for this life

22
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:49,840
so let's get together and get 1068

23
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,320
signed if you've signed anything else

24
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:55,039
here today and you have not signed 1068

25
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,280
please do so before you leave get your

26
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,399
friends to do so tell your parents tell

27
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,320
everybody

28
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,640
sign this thing whether you want it

29
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,920
legal or you don't stay you can't stand

30
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,760
it it doesn't matter get on the ballot

31
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,079
and vote for it that's how this country

32
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,079
works

33
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:14,478
so now a couple words from these guys

34
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,079
so i've been a little too busy gathering

35
00:01:14,478 --> 00:01:19,679
you know signatures to actually prepare

36
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:19,679
speech so i guess i'll have to ad hockey

37
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,080
my name is chris van putten and i i

38
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:25,519
coordinate the volunteer efforts

39
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:29,519
throughout pierce county on behalf of

40
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:29,519
i-1068 to legalize marijuana

41
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:34,719
so some people ask me how did you come

42
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:37,359
to do that

43
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:39,519
how did you come to become a coordinator

44
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:41,759
on behalf of 1068

45
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:43,280
well i volunteered

46
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,280
i started gathering signatures and i

47
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,799
kept gathering signatures and after i

48
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,200
kept gathering signatures and no one

49
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,600
started stepping up as a coordinator i

50
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:55,280
was selected and i said hey i want to

51
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:57,438
help other people gather signatures too

52
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,280
originally i guess it all started you

53
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:01,599
know last fall

54
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:05,040
started learning about marijuana before

55
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:07,919
i just been brainwashed stigma publicity

56
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,719
government right i learned about it i

57
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,439
read i read studies after study and the

58
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:15,598
more i read the less prohibition made

59
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:16,479
sense

60
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:19,598
so

61
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:21,280
after i saw the 1068 was out

62
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:22,399
signed the initiative

63
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,878
write it

64
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,599
realize i have to make the change i have

65
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:28,959
to help other people make the change

66
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:31,199
when we want to see a change in the

67
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:32,560
world we have to make that change and we

68
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:34,958
have to let the people

69
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,640
vote on the change and let the

70
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:39,598
government reflect the popular opinion

71
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:40,958
of society and my opinion of how the

72
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:43,518
world should be

73
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,920
doesn't coincide with how it is

74
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:48,239
so it's then my prerogative

75
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:51,119
to coordinate and to help

76
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:56,280
reform society and help all of you

77
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:56,280
to help 1068 and legalize marijuana

78
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,200
hello tacoma

79
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:15,199
hey i'm don skacky with initiative 1068

80
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:18,399
i'm the northwest washington field

81
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:20,799
director and we are getting it done

82
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,120
and like you've been told

83
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,800
none of us are paid everybody's been out

84
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,719
on the streets they've been out in bad

85
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,719
weather cold weather cloudy weather

86
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:31,039
sunny weather hot weather they're

87
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:33,680
getting it done but actually they're not

88
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:36,158
getting it done you are all getting it

89
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,879
done because without you we can't put on

90
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:40,798
the ballot our polling says that when

91
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:42,000
you talk to voters

92
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,560
53

93
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,840
say yes 35

94
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,959
say no

95
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:51,280
that is way beyond a margin of error all

96
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:54,000
we need to do is get it on the ballot

97
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,000
and people will vote yes but if we don't

98
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,239
get it on the ballot you're not gonna

99
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,840
have your chance they're gonna send it

100
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,158
back to the legislature where they can

101
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,560
screw it all up like they tried to sell

102
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:06,560
it in liquor stores early this year that

103
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,280
doesn't fly with my medicine next to

104
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:12,080
dangerous alcohol that's right

105
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,799
put this on the ballot if you have not

106
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,639
signed the 1068

107
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,720
register to vote if you're not already

108
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:22,240
registered sign it if you have not

109
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:24,080
already signed it and more importantly

110
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,400
we are in the process of counting right

111
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:28,560
now and we've got a margin of error of

112
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:30,879
seven and a half percent

113
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,959
and that is because of people like you

114
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:34,319
that know that once you've signed it

115
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:36,079
that you've done

116
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:37,839
and because of all volunteers that i'm

117
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:39,758
checking to make sure that you don't

118
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:41,839
sign it more than one time

119
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,840
but lately we've had some problems with

120
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:46,638
other signature gatherers from paid

121
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:48,239
petitions claiming to be us

122
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,680
so at this point

123
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,720
it can't hurt

124
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,478
if if you're sure you've signed 1068

125
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,720
please don't sign it again

126
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:59,039
but if you're not sure if you don't

127
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,440
remember if it was that one or not

128
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,600
or if you thought it was 1068 but when

129
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:05,839
you look at our sheet take the time to

130
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:09,280
look at what you're signing

131
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:10,478
make sure it's 1068 and get it signed

132
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:12,879
we've got

133
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:15,680
this event we've got taste of tacoma

134
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:17,759
we've got hoopfest and spokane we've got

135
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,759
gay pride up in seattle this weekend we

136
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,919
have every other thing that's happening

137
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,759
in the state and i can tell you from as

138
00:05:21,918 --> 00:05:25,839
someone that sat there in that offices

139
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:28,080
the last couple of days and counted

140
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:30,719
signatures we're looking at the numbers

141
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:33,359
and they are damn close people they are

142
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,600
so close that we are either going to or

143
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,400
going to not make it on the ballot by

144
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,479
the slimmest of margins so

145
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:42,159
talk to everyone you know

146
00:05:40,478 --> 00:05:44,000
ask them to sign

147
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,840
ask them to volunteer

148
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,639
pick up a petition out of the stranger

149
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:51,198

00:05:56,399 --> 00:06:02,079

154
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,079
prohibition in washington

155
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:10,318
state i can't tell you how often i've

156
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
stood out for hours and had

157
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,960
person after person come up to me and

158
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,079

163
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:26,319
