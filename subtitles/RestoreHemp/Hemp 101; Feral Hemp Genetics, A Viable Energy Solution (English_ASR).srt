1
00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:06,600
I know Agra that you've been working on

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:08,460
hemp fuel projects for many years and uh

3
00:00:06,599 --> 00:00:11,638
could you talk about how Pharaoh hemp

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:14,460
here in the Midwest could uh solve our

5
00:00:11,638 --> 00:00:16,799
energy problems well I don't know that

6
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:18,420
feral hemp the feral hemp genetics could

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,539
solve our energy problems but the feral

8
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:23,580
hemp is a small amount of the of the

9
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:25,920
plant growth in the area we took a feral

10
00:00:23,579 --> 00:00:28,559
Hemp stock and and grew that

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,019
agriculturally well we want to grow 500

12
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:32,339
acres of hemp under a center pivot and

13
00:00:31,018 --> 00:00:34,859
we're looking at what kind of

14
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,960
preparations do we have to undertake in

15
00:00:34,859 --> 00:00:39,719
order to grow a crop of a size that can

16
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,660
make a difference and assuming a

17
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:44,820
hundred-fold increase you need uh five

18
00:00:42,659 --> 00:00:46,619
acres a year before that of seed crop

19
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,899
dedicated for seed not making food out

20
00:00:46,619 --> 00:00:51,058
of it and five hundredths of an acre the

21
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:53,820
year before that which is like 20 foot

22
00:00:51,058 --> 00:00:56,218
by 20 foot and

23
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:58,738
the year before that two foot by tufa

24
00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:01,379
which is really one plant

25
00:00:58,738 --> 00:01:04,079
and so we're four years away from being

26
00:01:01,378 --> 00:01:07,819
able to grow industrial hemp

27
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:07,819
on a scale it can make a difference
