00:00:15,028 --> 00:00:25,868
last night in a dream i interrogated god

2
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:31,420
why is it the good die young what's the

3
00:00:25,868 --> 00:00:36,698
reason to this we talked we argued we

4
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:43,420
cried I never did get any answers but

5
00:00:36,698 --> 00:00:48,519
God knows I tried the answers already

6
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:52,300
know a question for the question who is

7
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:56,770
it took the creation story claimed it

8
00:00:52,299 --> 00:00:58,649
then took it apart glorifying obedience

9
00:00:56,770 --> 00:01:02,380
in fear

10
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:03,780
rampaging through the mine stamping

11
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:07,079
uncertainty

12
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:10,560
into the heart and then there's that

13
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:12,609
original sin and something about the

14
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,269
devil to pay

15
00:01:12,609 --> 00:01:18,890
and that golden rule do unto others

16
00:01:15,269 --> 00:01:22,670
obviously isn't really a rule

17
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:26,150
the Lord giveth the Lord taketh away the

18
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:30,040
violence gets violent and God just sits

19
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:30,040
there with nothing to say

20
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:32,629
Oh

21
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:07,959
I've read it said in the beginning was

22
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:09,618
the word and the Word was God I never

23
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:13,009
read it said

24
00:02:09,618 --> 00:02:17,870
in the beginning was thought and the

25
00:02:13,009 --> 00:02:20,560
thought is to think what that has to do

26
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:20,560
with anything

27
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:32,280
last night any drinking interrogative

28
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:37,140
God why is it the good die young what's

29
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:42,110
the reason to this we talked we argue we

30
00:02:37,139 --> 00:02:46,629
cry I never did get any answer

31
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:46,630
but God knows I tried
