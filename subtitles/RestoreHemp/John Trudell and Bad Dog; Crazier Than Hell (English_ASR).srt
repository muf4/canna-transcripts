1
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,840
feeling

2
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:21,839
crazier than hell

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,679
got this time on my hands

4
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,039
and got you

5
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:33,439
on my mind

6
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:35,840
and got nowhere else

7
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:35,839
to go

8
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,239
the fires

9
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:43,759
burn hot and cold

10
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:45,359
that someplace

11
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:48,799
in between

12
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:52,640
the melt and the freeze

13
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:52,640
this need for reaching for you

14
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,640
you

15
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,558
were all i could be

16
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,280
now i'm here

17
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:04,878
wearing alone

18
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,439
we were one

19
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,040
now i'm a ghost

20
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:11,199
falling

21
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,840
from my place

22
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,840
in the sun

23
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:20,079
this dizzy

24
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,079
is out of control

25
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:23,839
the world keeps spinning

26
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:28,478
i heard

27
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:29,759
a vibrating echoing

28
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:31,519
sounded

29
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,000
a lot

30
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:34,000
like you

31
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:45,200
amongst the truths i sought

32
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,200
you were the one i found

33
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,239
now i'm needing

34
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:52,719
the remembering close

35
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:55,839
of memories of you

36
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:55,840
holding my hand

37
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:01,759
remembrances of laughter singing

38
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,640
songing the nights

39
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:08,878
with belonging

40
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:10,080
sweetnessing the shelter of each other

41
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:12,079
reality

42
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:15,879
the reality

43
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,879
of safe feeling

44
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,560
got you on my mind

45
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:56,959
with these times of missing you

46
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:56,959
i'm never not going to love you

47
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:02,560
these days

48
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,560
without you to hold my hand

49
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:10,238
feeling crazier than hell

50
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:13,439
this crazy just goes on and on and on

51
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:15,439
in this confusion of me

52
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:18,318
crazy together

53
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:21,919
or crazy apart

54
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:23,359
when crazy is crazy

55
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:26,158
it's not always

56
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,159
in our heads

57
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:33,000
sometimes

58
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,000
it's in our hearts

59
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:42,560
feeling crazier than hell

60
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:48,158
got this time on my hands

61
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:51,039
and got you

62
00:03:48,158 --> 00:03:51,039
in my mind

63
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:57,400
and got nowhere else

64
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,400
to go

65
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,199
you
