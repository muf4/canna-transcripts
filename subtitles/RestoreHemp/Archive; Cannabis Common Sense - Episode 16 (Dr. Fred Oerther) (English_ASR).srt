00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,849
I'm Paul Stanford welcome to the show

17
00:01:02,149 --> 00:01:06,920
yeah and this show was brought to you by

18
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:08,750
our political action committee that

19
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:11,990
campaigned for the restoration and

20
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:14,750
regulation of hemp it's all volunteer

21
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:17,269
effort and exists solely to put the

22
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:19,069
Oregon camest tax act on a ballot which

23
00:01:17,269 --> 00:01:23,449
exists solely to get back some of our

24
00:01:19,069 --> 00:01:24,979
freedoms which allow us to enjoy

25
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:27,409
cannabis recreationally

26
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:29,510
I'm handed out as medicine through

27
00:01:27,409 --> 00:01:30,530
pharmacies and our farmers can grow

28
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:33,790
industrial hemp

29
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:38,659
yeah the Oregon cannabis Tax Act would

30
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:41,750
allow the state to make some money just

31
00:01:38,659 --> 00:01:45,439
the way they make money off beer liquor

32
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:47,359
and tobacco in terms of taxing it

33
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:49,819
through the state liquor store system

34
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:54,920
like they do with distilled alcohol the

35
00:01:49,819 --> 00:01:56,899
state would license farmers to cultivate

36
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:58,670
the drug for sales to the state

37
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:00,710
commission then the state commission

38
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:03,650
would distribute it at cost to

39
00:02:00,709 --> 00:02:05,839
pharmacies and to the liquor stores

40
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:08,300
where they'd make a profit would also

41
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:12,560
allow farmers to cultivate industrial

42
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:14,020
hemp and him par viewers know produces

43
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,050
more fiber for clothes

44
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:19,270
in textiles and paper and more oil for

45
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:22,000
fuel and food and more protein than any

46
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:26,320
other plant on this planet so our job

47
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,870
here is to stop the war on drugs and

48
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:31,900
we're trying to do that through using

49
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:33,789
our most powerful tool the pen through

50
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:36,550
the initiative process and we need your

51
00:02:33,789 --> 00:02:38,560
help so we urge you to give us a call at

52
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:39,250

screen

style 5:03 2 3 5 4 6 o 6 we'll send you

58
00:02:52,960 --> 00:03:01,180
our newspaper and our petitions because

59
00:02:56,349 --> 00:03:02,979
we want to get you involved there's a

60
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:05,849
bunch of different ways to get involved

61
00:03:02,979 --> 00:03:10,019
outside of petitioning - including

62
00:03:05,849 --> 00:03:12,939
transporting people to events data-entry

63
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:14,500
delivering newspapers but most of all we

64
00:03:12,939 --> 00:03:16,659
want to get you involved right Paul

65
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:19,509
yeah it's very simple to gather

66
00:03:16,659 --> 00:03:22,359
signatures just the other day Paul and I

67
00:03:19,509 --> 00:03:24,549
went out with a new person and within

68
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,960
you know half an hour he had picked it

69
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:29,110
picked it up and was raring to go the

70
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:30,849
next day out by himself and it's just

71
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:32,980
and it's fun you're actually out there

72
00:03:30,849 --> 00:03:35,769
you know you're meeting people it's a

73
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:38,310
good place to people watch and it's it's

74
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:42,159
amazing to find out how many people

75
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:43,930
don't care about their own personal

76
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:45,969
lives out there you ask them if they're

77
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:48,129
you know you know if you want to look at

78
00:03:45,969 --> 00:03:50,080
its I initiate eveni and say no then we

79
00:03:48,129 --> 00:03:51,939
ask what what the initiative is they

80
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,590
have no they don't care about their own

81
00:03:51,939 --> 00:03:57,189
political rights anymore that it's like

82
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:59,159
to involve themselves to do anything

83
00:03:57,189 --> 00:04:02,439
about it you know because they're just

84
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:04,810
it's it's that you know our society has

85
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:06,180
taught us to you know go inward I mean

86
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:10,080
not think about anything else

87
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:12,430
mm-hmm voting is just one way of

88
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:15,160
democracy you know democracy is really

89
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:17,410
power in the people and not to wolves to

90
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:19,209
the sheep voting on the menu which is

91
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:21,870
what's become right mature they call it

92
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:25,050
majoritarianism

93
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:26,759
but politics and voting you vote a lot

94
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:28,889
of ways you vote with dollars you vote

95
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:31,379
with your feet you vote with ballots and

96
00:04:28,889 --> 00:04:34,710
if it comes to it sometimes in some

97
00:04:31,379 --> 00:04:36,418
jurisdictions they've voted with bullets

98
00:04:34,709 --> 00:04:41,489
they did here a couple of hundred years

99
00:04:36,418 --> 00:04:44,639
ago 1776 and and but the the initiative

100
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:46,949
process is a way to peacefully

101
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,918
participate in the political process and

102
00:04:46,949 --> 00:04:51,750
under the the theories that we we call

103
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:54,359
our own we're supposed to be able to

104
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:56,668
change the rules under which we live and

105
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:59,160
that's well you know I'd like to tell

106
00:04:56,668 --> 00:05:02,339
people that petitioning is one of the

107
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:04,650
most effective and effectiveness

108
00:05:02,339 --> 00:05:07,259
oriented activities that you can take on

109
00:05:04,649 --> 00:05:09,659
a previous show I've given this analogy

110
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:11,579
that I think vote if you don't exercise

111
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:15,570
your political rights you lose your

112
00:05:11,579 --> 00:05:17,728
political rights and just just like your

113
00:05:15,569 --> 00:05:20,399
any other type of exercise if you don't

114
00:05:17,728 --> 00:05:23,039
do it you're going to lose that power

115
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:25,709
and if you look at voting voting is a

116
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:29,189
very important activity and I wouldn't

117
00:05:25,709 --> 00:05:31,859
want to say to denigrate it at all but I

118
00:05:29,189 --> 00:05:34,319
think voting is like lifting a two pound

119
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:36,300
weight and if you're going to write to

120
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:37,110
your Congressman or write to your local

121
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:39,389
newspaper

122
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:41,280
that's like exercising and lifting a

123
00:05:39,389 --> 00:05:43,649
five-pound weight if you're gonna get a

124
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:44,909
petition though and circulate it among

125
00:05:43,649 --> 00:05:47,159
your family and friends

126
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:49,530
well now you're exercising with the

127
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:52,470
10-pound weight but it the most

128
00:05:49,529 --> 00:05:55,379
effective thing you can do is to go out

129
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:57,810
in public and meet people you don't know

130
00:05:55,379 --> 00:06:00,180
and if you do it with a group of us it's

131
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:01,860
fun and you have people tell you how

132
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:03,930
grateful they are that you're there

133
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:06,479
doing that and that to me is like

134
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:08,939
lifting a hundred pound weight in

135
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:11,430
comparison the different ways we can

136
00:06:08,939 --> 00:06:14,939
exercise our political rights I like

137
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:17,819
that I like that metaphor when I started

138
00:06:14,939 --> 00:06:20,969
petitioning I wasn't very good I knew

139
00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:23,519
what I knew but I couldn't express what

140
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:26,850
I knew and by the time I had talked to a

141
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:30,719
thousand people and explained what I was

142
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:33,510
about I refined my explanation down to a

143
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,360
very few very succinct cogent correct

144
00:06:33,509 --> 00:06:36,579
words

145
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:39,908
and after I'd listen to a thousand

146
00:06:36,579 --> 00:06:41,800
stories I knew what it was and I was

147
00:06:39,908 --> 00:06:44,168
able to respond to people's concerns

148
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:47,218
what are their common questions around

149
00:06:44,168 --> 00:06:50,500
this issue and to me it was invaluable

150
00:06:47,218 --> 00:06:52,689
political training I it was for me it

151
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:55,978
was better than going down to hang out

152
00:06:52,689 --> 00:06:58,210
in Salem that doing that kind of

153
00:06:55,978 --> 00:06:59,978
apprenticeship I know that you did an

154
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:02,529

pressure on it at all it all counts

00:07:25,629 --> 00:07:33,278

about something you and your intro you

167
00:07:35,139 --> 00:07:40,360
talked about what what happened when

168
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:42,189
they did when they ended alcohol

169
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:46,509
prohibition remember we had like 13 or

170
00:07:42,189 --> 00:07:49,449
14 years 29 to 33 to end alcohol

171
00:07:46,509 --> 00:07:52,718
prohibition and what did they do at the

172
00:07:49,449 --> 00:07:55,650
end of prohibition what they did was

173
00:07:52,718 --> 00:07:58,959
they set up what I call non criminal

174
00:07:55,649 --> 00:08:01,810
distribution basically and you've

175
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:03,908
addressed that in in the thing about the

176
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:05,379
the liquor stores and I wish you'd tell

177
00:08:03,908 --> 00:08:07,269
me a little bit more about how that's

178
00:08:05,379 --> 00:08:11,319
gonna work I'm very because there has to

179
00:08:07,269 --> 00:08:12,579
be non criminal distribution exactly

180
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:14,500
that there's gonna have to be that

181
00:08:12,579 --> 00:08:17,258
mechanism somehow it's going to have to

182
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:19,569
be set up and and worked and it's gonna

183
00:08:17,259 --> 00:08:21,400
have to be made fair and all of those

184
00:08:19,569 --> 00:08:25,300
things okay well what would happen is

185
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:29,168
this a farmer who is interested in

186
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:31,629
cultivating the drug for sale would get

187
00:08:29,168 --> 00:08:33,788
a license from what is currently the

188
00:08:31,629 --> 00:08:35,889
Oregon Liquor Control Commission however

189
00:08:33,788 --> 00:08:37,870
the Oregon cannabis Tax Act our

190
00:08:35,889 --> 00:08:41,788
initiative petition changes the name of

191
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:44,948
the olcc to the ICC the Oregon

192
00:08:41,788 --> 00:08:47,960
intoxicant Control Commission using the

193
00:08:44,948 --> 00:08:51,559
term intoxicant to represent what

194
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:55,040
both liquor and marijuana due to people

195
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:57,139
and so we decided to skewed the term

196
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:59,870
drugs because that might include

197
00:08:57,139 --> 00:09:01,730
pharmaceuticals well anyway a farmer who

198
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:04,278
was interested in that would apply for a

199
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:06,350
license the state would determine how

200
00:09:04,278 --> 00:09:08,830
much it needs to purchase in a given

201
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:12,320
period then the state would equitably

202
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:16,190
distribute the license among the

203
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:18,528
applicants and they would buy either the

204
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:20,209
maximum amount the farmer would grow or

205
00:09:18,528 --> 00:09:22,909
they would buy approximately the same

206
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:25,639
amount from the different farmers now

207
00:09:22,909 --> 00:09:28,039
according to specifically the Single

208
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:30,049
Convention treaty the state has to have

209
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:31,730
a commission and this is the single

210
00:09:30,049 --> 00:09:33,889
convention treaties an international

211
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:35,860
treaty that governs the way controlled

212
00:09:33,889 --> 00:09:38,088
substances can be sold by the

213
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:39,889
signatories and has over a hundred

214
00:09:38,089 --> 00:09:42,920
different nations that have signed up to

215
00:09:39,889 --> 00:09:44,870
it it's a it's a it's not a good treaty

216
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:47,449
by any means and personally I'd like to

217
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:50,629
see it repealed but it's the structure

218
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:52,790
that we first have to work in and the

219
00:09:50,629 --> 00:09:55,070
way to repeal it is to go to the United

220
00:09:52,789 --> 00:09:58,129
States Senate and have them repeal it

221
00:09:55,070 --> 00:10:00,470
well it's a real hard job to go to your

222
00:09:58,129 --> 00:10:01,399
hundred US senators and get them to do

223
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:03,440
something like that

224
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:05,870
so here we tried to write our initiative

225
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,580
in compliance with that treaty so that

226
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:10,639
it be upheld according to that treaty

227
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:13,940
the state has to collect the entire crop

228
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:15,588
within four months of harvest so the

229
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:17,930
cannabis would be harvested by the

230
00:10:15,589 --> 00:10:22,370
farmers and then it might be processed

231
00:10:17,929 --> 00:10:25,609
into cigarettes or any one of a number

232
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:28,610
of things and so processors would have

233
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:30,080
it but within um four months of harvest

234
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:32,899
the state would take control of that and

235
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:35,209
then distribute it to pharmacies for

236
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:37,759
medical need and it would be it cost for

237
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:40,549
pharmacies it wouldn't be taxed and it

238
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:43,129
would sell it through the 270 store

239
00:10:40,549 --> 00:10:45,229
liquor store system that we have here in

240
00:10:43,129 --> 00:10:48,289
the state of Oregon here in Oregon we're

241
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:51,620
one of the 26 states that has a state

242
00:10:48,289 --> 00:10:53,719
controlled storage system for distilled

243
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:56,419
alcohol products and rather than

244
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:58,759
creating a new infrastructure to comply

245
00:10:56,419 --> 00:11:00,409
with these international treaties we

246
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:01,580
decided to work within the existing

247
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:03,199
structure

248
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:04,879
so the state would take control of it

249
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,120
and put it in the state liquor stores

250
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:09,889
however our initiative allows

251
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:13,000
individuals to cultivate their own

252
00:11:09,889 --> 00:11:16,659
marijuana without a license and it also

253
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:21,019
makes it illegal to prohibit any

254
00:11:16,659 --> 00:11:22,370
specific strain of seed or cuttings so

255
00:11:21,019 --> 00:11:25,009
if you want to go to your local garden

256
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:28,519
store and pick out the variety you want

257
00:11:25,009 --> 00:11:32,960
or the seed that you want the the trade

258
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:35,899
in the seeds and starts is not regulated

259
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:37,730
but the trade in the Dragons basically

260
00:11:35,899 --> 00:11:40,850
it's like wine and beer if you want to

261
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:43,550
brew your own beer or make your own wine

262
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:46,310
you don't need a license to be able to

263
00:11:43,549 --> 00:11:53,539
do that but if you want to brew enough

264
00:11:46,309 --> 00:11:55,250
beer or make enough wine to sell and you

265
00:11:53,539 --> 00:11:56,959
want to sell it then you've got to get a

266
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:59,450
license and the government is going to

267
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:02,110
come in and make certain you're applying

268
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:04,640
the laws that the legislature

269
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:06,860
legislators enacted does that explain it

270
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:09,919
is there anything that's missing here

271
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:12,409
yeah we have again the in short a

272
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:15,439
non-criminal distribution system it's

273
00:12:12,409 --> 00:12:19,389
set up we have the skeleton or the

274
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:23,630
outline or the it's already there

275
00:12:19,389 --> 00:12:26,480
does the single convention deal with

276
00:12:23,629 --> 00:12:29,120
alcohol as no substance no so that's out

277
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:31,070
of the exactly the purview of the single

278
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,289
Kimmage okay that's not a scheduled

279
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:35,210
drugs and then they don't and it's not

280
00:12:33,289 --> 00:12:37,189
and tobacco also it's not a scheduled

281
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:38,930
drug no not at all it's not even

282
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:40,820
considered a drunk yet even though the

283
00:12:38,929 --> 00:12:42,949
settlement with the tobacco company so

284
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:44,629
in the in the u.s. now that the FDA has

285
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:46,610
the authority to regulate that with the

286
00:12:44,629 --> 00:12:51,320
drug it is a drug yeah okay so we should

287
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:53,570
see some interesting things you know if

288
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:55,970
it was if it was health and safety as

289
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:59,240
somebody pointed out not too long ago

290
00:12:55,970 --> 00:13:05,060
they would be confiscating the homes and

291
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:08,750
cars and money of people who use alcohol

292
00:13:05,059 --> 00:13:12,679
and tobacco or who buy and sell alcohol

293
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:15,740
and tobacco and and that's the

294
00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:18,649
the prohibition approach and they have

295
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:20,810
they have chosen not to do it at all as

296
00:13:18,649 --> 00:13:23,240
far as tobacco is concerned until

297
00:13:20,809 --> 00:13:26,289
recently and that's 400,000 deaths a

298
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:30,620
year according to yeah yeah more

299
00:13:26,289 --> 00:13:31,579
statistics yeah 400 and yeah far more

300
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:33,679
than alcohol

301
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:36,139
yeah alcohol you get a hundred thousand

302
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:39,588
deaths a year but for marijuana

303
00:13:36,139 --> 00:13:42,830
zip zilch and all he wrote folks even if

304
00:13:39,589 --> 00:13:44,630
you believe their numbers all all that's

305
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:47,180
they're not illegal drugs put together

306
00:13:44,629 --> 00:13:49,100
is less what five thousand something

307
00:13:47,179 --> 00:13:51,859
like that it is yeah because very few

308
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:54,790
people you know actually died from the

309
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:57,110
illegal drugs they died from you know

310
00:13:54,789 --> 00:14:00,860
poor nutrition because they're doing

311
00:13:57,110 --> 00:14:02,690
illegal drugs pharmacist it's same thing

312
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:04,190
it's the same thing though farms are the

313
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:06,740
drugs the people of poor nutrition and

314
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:08,870
they're doing pharmaceutical drugs yeah

315
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:10,879
but it's from all the side effects that

316
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:12,139
the impurities that they mix with these

317
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:14,149
drugs yeah

318
00:14:12,139 --> 00:14:16,100
like even these days with cannabis you

319
00:14:14,149 --> 00:14:17,779
never know what's sprayed on cannabis I

320
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:19,879
mean that's you know frame we'll just

321
00:14:17,779 --> 00:14:21,259
consumer out there that's the scary part

322
00:14:19,879 --> 00:14:23,600
you don't know what somebody's sprayed

323
00:14:21,259 --> 00:14:25,220
out so in light of that I'd like to

324
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,339
point out that the Oregon cannabis Tax

325
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:31,370
Act takes that into consideration the

326
00:14:27,339 --> 00:14:33,470
cannabis that is sold has to be graded

327
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:36,679
and tested for adulterants and the

328
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:39,649
packages have to say what adulterants

329
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:42,559
what additives are included in that

330
00:14:39,649 --> 00:14:44,360
cannabis if you look at tobacco we all

331
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:46,338
know they put saltpeter in there to make

332
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:49,730
them burn they actually put a little bit

333
00:14:46,339 --> 00:14:54,070
of ammonia in there to release the the

334
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:58,850
nicotine and make it pass through the

335
00:14:54,070 --> 00:15:03,470
the blood air membranes in your lungs

336
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:05,360
they put in I've heard upwards to I

337
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:08,029
don't know what is it 400 different

338
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,709
chemicals in a tobacco cigarette but

339
00:15:08,029 --> 00:15:12,289
you'll never find that written on any

340
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:13,849
package about no cigarettes what they do

341
00:15:12,289 --> 00:15:15,439
is they chop it up and they put it into

342
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:17,470
a sludge and they add a bunch of stuff

343
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:20,209
to it then they dry it out well

344
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:22,610
according to the Oregon cannabis Tax Act

345
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:24,349
if they wanted to do something like that

346
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:26,090
with cannabis they'd have to list every

347
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:29,870
single added

348
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:32,090
and they would have to I warn of the

349
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:34,340
health danger of any that have harmful

350
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:36,860
effects known harmful effects to human

351
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:38,990
health they brought it on themselves you

352
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:41,389
know when I was the kid fifty years ago

353
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:44,480
we all called cigarettes were called

354
00:15:41,389 --> 00:15:46,819
coffin nails everybody knew that one

355
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:49,700
cigarette short took a day off your life

356
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:52,160
that was or an hour you know there was

357
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:54,020
some kinda that that was common

358
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:57,559
knowledge if there was it was it was

359
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:59,090
vernacular proof and you know they've

360
00:15:57,559 --> 00:16:01,039
gotten away with that for years they run

361
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:05,090
that scan but science hasn't proven well

362
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:07,429
yes nobody asks science they ask shil

363
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:12,019
stopped but and she'll say oh no there's

364
00:16:07,429 --> 00:16:14,629
nothing but you know the this they have

365
00:16:12,019 --> 00:16:17,179
not treated tobacco very well it the

366
00:16:14,629 --> 00:16:19,970
thing I find historically interesting

367
00:16:17,179 --> 00:16:23,229
about alcohol prohibition is we have

368
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:25,759
prohibition from 29 to 33 and

369
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:28,639
historically to me it looks like for the

370
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:31,730
next 50 years after alcohol prohibition

371
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:33,860
was repealed that the public attitude

372
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:36,409
was so bad about anybody that talked

373
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:40,250
about alcohol that we couldn't publicly

374
00:16:36,409 --> 00:16:42,110
recognize that that that hundreds of

375
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:44,389
thousands of people were dying or being

376
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:46,399
injured in drunk driving accidents every

377
00:16:44,389 --> 00:16:48,409
year the people were dying of cirrhosis

378
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:51,769
the people have brought these problems

379
00:16:48,409 --> 00:16:53,750
up were ignored because of that 13 years

380
00:16:51,769 --> 00:16:57,259
of moral grandeur that they called

381
00:16:53,750 --> 00:17:00,740
alcohol prohibition with gangs with with

382
00:16:57,259 --> 00:17:04,190
increasing federal enrichment into the

383
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:06,140
lives of private citizens and also into

384
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:08,480
local politics the feds got big into

385
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:11,780
local law enforcement politics in

386
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:15,470
prohibition and it took 50 years before

387
00:17:11,779 --> 00:17:18,740
society as a whole and our rulers as a

388
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:21,470
group could begin to address the problem

389
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:23,029
of alcohol consumption it's not wasn't

390
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:25,460
just that I think because if you went

391
00:17:23,029 --> 00:17:27,680
back when they repeal prohibition it was

392
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:29,420
a two part thing as usual the government

393
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:32,150
always gets the second part part number

394
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:34,460
one repeal prohibition part number two

395
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:35,360
there was to be a massive education

396
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:37,840
campaign

397
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:41,178
to the American public about the dangers

398
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:43,189
the use of alcohol which is be funded by

399
00:17:41,179 --> 00:17:44,840
the alcohol companies but you know that

400
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:47,419
was the agreement but you know next to

401
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:50,119
the next day they Acts Part B if it

402
00:17:47,419 --> 00:17:51,679
happens all the time now I don't know

403
00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:54,288
wait you know but I mean that's that's

404
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:56,028
that's where the real problem was and

405
00:17:54,288 --> 00:17:58,398
that's why you know the abuse to this

406
00:17:56,028 --> 00:18:00,140
day rains with alcohol and which is why

407
00:17:58,398 --> 00:18:02,658
among our children that's the highest

408
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:04,549
drug they abuses alcohol but we know

409
00:18:02,659 --> 00:18:05,028
with Oregon cameras TaxACT a different

410
00:18:04,548 --> 00:18:09,730
story

411
00:18:05,028 --> 00:18:12,470
yeah we we wrote the TaxACT base to

412
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:16,069
specifically distribute the profits and

413
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:19,250
the taxes that will be the state's

414
00:18:16,069 --> 00:18:21,099
windfall when they tax and regulate the

415
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:23,269
cannabis market you know right now

416
00:18:21,099 --> 00:18:25,730
marijuana is the number one cash crop

417
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:28,700
here in the United States and in an

418
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:31,460
Oregon it's the number one cash crop by

419
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:32,750
probably the largest factor in in the

420
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:35,778
United States with the possible

421
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:37,278
exception of Hawaii here in Oregon we

422
00:18:35,778 --> 00:18:40,609
have one of the highest per capita

423
00:18:37,278 --> 00:18:43,130
production rates of cannabis what our

424
00:18:40,609 --> 00:18:45,558
initiative will do is it would bring in

425
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:48,740
that money out of the black market and

426
00:18:45,558 --> 00:18:51,079
put it on the table for all of us to see

427
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:53,990
and the state would have a share in that

428
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:58,849
you know in 1989 the DEA said that that

429
00:18:53,990 --> 00:19:01,788
was 2.6 billion dollars that's the price

430
00:18:58,849 --> 00:19:04,009
of marijuana is about doubled since 1989

431
00:19:01,788 --> 00:19:05,658
so it might have gone up maybe

432
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:07,879
productions gone down it's very

433
00:19:05,659 --> 00:19:10,940
difficult to gauge these things but

434
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:15,620
let's say that we could bring in 20% of

435
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:17,570
that if we could bring in 20% of 2.6

436
00:19:15,619 --> 00:19:20,168
billion dollars we're talking five

437
00:19:17,569 --> 00:19:22,490
hundred million dollars that by far

438
00:19:20,169 --> 00:19:26,690
dwarfs the amount of money that's coming

439
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:29,929
in from the lottery the lottery proceeds

440
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:32,058
are projected over two years where this

441
00:19:29,929 --> 00:19:36,110
would just be a single year over a two

442
00:19:32,058 --> 00:19:37,970
year biennium as our financial and

443
00:19:36,109 --> 00:19:39,500
physical statements are made by state

444
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:42,528
government we'd be talking about a

445
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:47,450
billion dollars or maybe a tenth or more

446
00:19:42,528 --> 00:19:49,279
of total state revenue well I thought

447
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:51,440
you know you're gonna get into the fact

448
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:53,509
organ cameras TaxACT put all that side

449
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,610
that we direct money to go into exam

450
00:19:53,509 --> 00:19:57,710
treatment programs education that's the

451
00:19:55,609 --> 00:19:59,839
important thing too it doesn't matter

452
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:02,120
what the money figures are cuz people

453
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:03,859
will always argue with us but but if you

454
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:06,559
can point the fact that we're going to

455
00:20:03,859 --> 00:20:09,740
direct proceeds to treatment programs

456
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:11,779
education programs so that you know that

457
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:13,549
people will be able to get help if they

458
00:20:11,779 --> 00:20:15,769
want help well ninety percent of the

459
00:20:13,549 --> 00:20:19,549
proceeds would go into the state general

460
00:20:15,769 --> 00:20:23,299
fund as revenue for state programs but

461
00:20:19,549 --> 00:20:25,159
then eight percent would go in to drug

462
00:20:23,299 --> 00:20:27,409
treatment programs you know right now

463
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:29,029
alcoholics and addicts are turned away

464
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:32,000
ninety percent of the time when they

465
00:20:29,029 --> 00:20:33,889
seek help usually they only can get that

466
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,970
help after they've been found guilty of

467
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:37,040
some other crime

468
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:41,809
well our initiative would increase

469
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:44,450
funding for that by several times and it

470
00:20:41,809 --> 00:20:48,259
would 8% of the total proceeds would go

471
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:51,440
in to substance abuse treatment programs

472
00:20:48,259 --> 00:20:53,930
one percent would go into funding and

473
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:56,840
creating a comprehensive and realistic

474
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:59,000
drug education program for kids and then

475
00:20:56,839 --> 00:21:02,899
the final one percent would go into a

476
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:05,569
state agricultural committee to promote

477
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:07,220
industrial hemp since hemp has been

478
00:21:05,569 --> 00:21:09,319
repressed and many people myself

479
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:13,190
included believe that the whole

480
00:21:09,319 --> 00:21:16,009
marijuana smoke screen pun intended

481
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:19,930
was created to divert attention away

482
00:21:16,009 --> 00:21:22,309
from the fact that hemp it produces more

483
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:24,650
fiber protein and oil than any other

484
00:21:22,309 --> 00:21:27,289
problem we we think that one percent of

485
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:29,900
the proceeds from the profit of the sale

486
00:21:27,289 --> 00:21:32,480
of the drug going to reestablish this

487
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:34,730
vital and sustainable energy industry is

488
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,769
is quite appropriate we think it will

489
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:38,509
help put oregon on the cutting edge of

490
00:21:36,769 --> 00:21:40,220
exciting new developments and

491
00:21:38,509 --> 00:21:43,460
technologies that are truly sustainable

492
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:45,920
well yeah i you know believe that we

493
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:47,870
can't just as we can't throw all sorts

494
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:50,029
of wild numbers about tax proceeds

495
00:21:47,869 --> 00:21:52,039
coming from this we do we don't know

496
00:21:50,029 --> 00:21:53,809
what the industrial hemp market would be

497
00:21:52,039 --> 00:21:56,210
because it's been so long we've been

498
00:21:53,809 --> 00:21:58,789
caught up in this cult of you know of

499
00:21:56,210 --> 00:22:01,460
modernity we said okay we now we can

500
00:21:58,789 --> 00:22:02,428
have petroleum now we can have plastics

501
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:04,889
we can have cotton

502
00:22:02,429 --> 00:22:07,919
and people were so excited by new modern

503
00:22:04,888 --> 00:22:09,839
things they forgot him because hemp you

504
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:11,580
know also became that was for the low

505
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:13,470
class people wore hemp clothes

506
00:22:11,579 --> 00:22:16,138
meaning the upper classes were silk and

507
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:18,179
then cotton you know and so it became

508
00:22:16,138 --> 00:22:20,189
service thing like only the lower-class

509
00:22:18,179 --> 00:22:22,259
people would would wear it and would use

510
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:25,288
it as a fiber and then only lower cut

511
00:22:22,259 --> 00:22:27,509
people would use it as a intoxicant and

512
00:22:25,288 --> 00:22:31,169
that's the you know and that's what you

513
00:22:27,509 --> 00:22:32,490
have to get back away from right either

514
00:22:31,169 --> 00:22:36,559
better we all got a cop to be in low

515
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:39,450
class people yeah yeah and we're not

516
00:22:36,558 --> 00:22:42,298
that were not but it's you know we've

517
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:44,610
got to learn again what what him can do

518
00:22:42,298 --> 00:22:46,470
for us we've forgotten and that's what

519
00:22:44,609 --> 00:22:48,689
it comes down to if there's to be a

520
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:52,798
chief and a halfway chance of saving the

521
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:56,929
remaining trees and putting the put in

522
00:22:52,798 --> 00:23:01,048
the farmland into in the useful service

523
00:22:56,929 --> 00:23:02,730
hemp is is the way to do it until about

524
00:23:01,048 --> 00:23:05,089
a hundred and forty years ago over

525
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:07,980
ninety percent of all the world's paper

526
00:23:05,089 --> 00:23:09,868
yep of course remember 100 four years

527
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:12,210
ago very very little paper in his world

528
00:23:09,868 --> 00:23:13,618
yes a lot less yeah so we don't I mean

529
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:14,879
so when people start throwing numbers

530
00:23:13,618 --> 00:23:17,788
around is what I put that in perspective

531
00:23:14,878 --> 00:23:19,259
that we just don't know what industrial

532
00:23:17,788 --> 00:23:21,599
hemp will do for us because we haven't

533
00:23:19,259 --> 00:23:26,970
used it so long it's time to experiment

534
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:29,308
I know my household is now where we're

535
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:33,179
active we we read a lot we write a lot

536
00:23:29,308 --> 00:23:35,730
and and so forth but we're jacking out

537
00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:38,759
the equivalent of 20 foot of tree every

538
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:40,589
two weeks in in terms of newsmen you

539
00:23:38,759 --> 00:23:44,210
know three foot of newsprint 20 foot of

540
00:23:40,589 --> 00:23:48,209
tree yeah and every two weeks were

541
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:50,579
firing out 20 foot of tree yeah and I'm

542
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:52,798
a pauper and and penal we cut down and

543
00:23:50,579 --> 00:23:55,829
we recycle and I'm just appalled between

544
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:58,579
the mail the newspaper and then you know

545
00:23:55,829 --> 00:24:01,138
the computer paper and and and the the

546
00:23:58,579 --> 00:24:05,490
advertisements the the stuffers you know

547
00:24:01,138 --> 00:24:08,398
is that much thick clay paper in in an

548
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:10,829
Oregonian when it comes by waste of the

549
00:24:08,398 --> 00:24:12,719
shiny stuff weighs almost as much as the

550
00:24:10,829 --> 00:24:15,029
paper itself yeah

551
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:17,970
but there's a tremendous amount of of

552
00:24:15,029 --> 00:24:21,210
trees going up the chimney that need not

553
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:24,360
there are other sources of pulp and

554
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:26,850
fiber now as some numbers that I do like

555
00:24:24,359 --> 00:24:28,678
to refer back to are the United States

556
00:24:26,849 --> 00:24:30,918
Department of Agriculture studies that

557
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:33,840
were done at the turn of this century in

558
00:24:30,919 --> 00:24:37,020
1916 the US Department of Agriculture

559
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:39,779
began looking at hemp Hurd's which were

560
00:24:37,019 --> 00:24:41,849
traditionally a waste material Hiep was

561
00:24:39,779 --> 00:24:44,548
traditionally grown for the bark or the

562
00:24:41,849 --> 00:24:46,980
bast fiber that's the outer part of the

563
00:24:44,548 --> 00:24:49,319
stalk the interior part of the stock the

564
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:51,210
hemp Hurd's were a waste material that

565
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:54,329
was used as animal bedding or sometimes

566
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:56,788
burn as a fuel but with the introduction

567
00:24:54,329 --> 00:24:59,490
of the dekor diecutting machine at the

568
00:24:56,788 --> 00:25:01,529
turn of this century that waste material

569
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:04,558
could be collected much more efficiently

570
00:25:01,529 --> 00:25:07,589
than it could previously be done when

571
00:25:04,558 --> 00:25:10,980
when it was the the bast fiber was

572
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:12,808
separated by hand in 1916 the United

573
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:16,200
States Department of Agriculture did a

574
00:25:12,808 --> 00:25:18,389
bulletin USDA bulletin 404 the name of

575
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:20,880
that bulletin was hip herds as a paper

576
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:24,240
making material and in that they said to

577
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:27,179
provide a mill that makes a hundred tons

578
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:29,400
of paper a day by today's standard a

579
00:25:27,179 --> 00:25:32,970
hundred tons of paper day is a very

580
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:34,830
small mill but by those standards it was

581
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:37,740
an average mill back at the turn of this

582
00:25:34,829 --> 00:25:40,949
century to provide that mill with enough

583
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:44,130
trees to feed the mill would take 40

584
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:46,890
thousand five hundred acres to provide

585
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:50,010
that same mill with this waste product

586
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:53,159
from producing him vast fiber and hemp

587
00:25:50,009 --> 00:25:55,140
seed oil and protein would take just ten

588
00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:57,120
thousand acres under cultivation now

589
00:25:55,140 --> 00:26:00,509
that's according the US Department of

590
00:25:57,119 --> 00:26:03,329
Agriculture's bulletin 404 admittedly

591
00:26:00,509 --> 00:26:05,819
it's a dated document and agricultural

592
00:26:03,329 --> 00:26:08,579
techniques have been improved since then

593
00:26:05,819 --> 00:26:11,339
but those techniques haven't been in

594
00:26:08,579 --> 00:26:14,308
practice with him well we really don't

595
00:26:11,339 --> 00:26:17,399
know what it back this time to

596
00:26:14,308 --> 00:26:18,899
experiment once again you know and you

597
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:20,400
know pun intended there once again you

598
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:21,899
know we have to experiment with him to

599
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,419
find out what it can do for us you know

600
00:26:21,898 --> 00:26:25,058
and we've forgotten at a society you

601
00:26:24,419 --> 00:26:27,249
know it's

602
00:26:25,058 --> 00:26:28,599
time to say okay you know let's do it

603
00:26:27,249 --> 00:26:32,409
and that's why we have the Oregon campus

604
00:26:28,599 --> 00:26:34,658
Tax Act you know asking folks out there

605
00:26:32,409 --> 00:26:36,340
to get out there and petition it's you

606
00:26:34,659 --> 00:26:38,860

get out with friends it's amazing how

608
00:26:38,859 --> 00:26:43,119
quickly time goes by and how many

609
00:26:40,419 --> 00:26:44,980
singers you can get in a hurry you know

610

to sign this and you're a few friends

612
00:26:46,359 --> 00:26:50,859
but best thing to do is come out and

613
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:55,028
petition you know at some summer event

614
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:57,189
concerts waterfront parks or ad malls

615
00:26:55,028 --> 00:26:59,950
and there's also out there now the

616
00:26:57,190 --> 00:27:01,330
Oregon drug control amendment put out by

617
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:03,149
the American and a prohibition League

618
00:27:01,329 --> 00:27:07,928
and then there's a referendum on the

619
00:27:03,148 --> 00:27:09,849
recrimination bill so help us out and

620
00:27:07,929 --> 00:27:11,830

621
00:27:09,849 --> 00:27:13,599
phone our phone number which is on the

00:27:11,829 --> 00:27:18,038
screen you should call it if you're in

623
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:20,079
the Portland area and is 2 3 5 4 6 o 6

624
00:27:18,038 --> 00:27:24,638
if you're outside of the Portland area

625
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:29,019
and you're watching this it's 1 5 0 3 2

630
00:27:42,339 --> 00:27:48,699
you can have a real impact and it's the

631
00:27:45,638 --> 00:27:51,908
most highly effective activity you could

632
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:53,919
take to stop the build-up of coercive

633
00:27:51,909 --> 00:27:54,490
police power in America that's what I

634
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:57,070
think

635
00:27:54,490 --> 00:27:59,079
yeah and initiatives all these so-called

636
00:27:57,069 --> 00:28:00,970
political consultants and the

637
00:27:59,079 --> 00:28:02,829
politicians in Salem themselves say that

638
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:04,749
if you get something down to ballot

639
00:28:02,829 --> 00:28:06,460
that's when they pay attention that's

640
00:28:04,749 --> 00:28:07,839
true it's like what happened last time

641
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:09,159
with the Oregon clean stream edition

642
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:11,648
they have a guy on a ballot but it lost

643
00:28:09,159 --> 00:28:13,419
but governor kids however they had to do

644
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:16,268
something this year you know they had

645
00:28:13,419 --> 00:28:18,340
because it was on the ballot it's like

646
00:28:16,269 --> 00:28:20,558
you know the so this will do this will

647
00:28:18,339 --> 00:28:22,118
tell the folks in Salem that were we're

648
00:28:20,558 --> 00:28:26,138
serious about this taking back our

649
00:28:22,118 --> 00:28:27,730
freedoms that's absolutely right but we

650
00:28:26,138 --> 00:28:31,240
can't do it ourselves you know I often

651
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:34,899
hear the question what are you going to

652
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:36,368
do to legalize marijuana well we're not

653
00:28:34,898 --> 00:28:37,619
going to do it by ourselves

654
00:28:36,368 --> 00:28:39,509
we've all

655
00:28:37,619 --> 00:28:42,179
all in this together and it's going to

656
00:28:39,509 --> 00:28:43,829
