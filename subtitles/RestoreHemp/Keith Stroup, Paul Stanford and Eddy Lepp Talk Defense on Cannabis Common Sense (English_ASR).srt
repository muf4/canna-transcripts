1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,560
and mr keystrop founder of normal i want

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:06,080
to welcome you back to the show again

3
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:08,719
thank you for taking the world's oldest

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,839
marijuana smoker

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,679
yeah

6
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:14,240
and we were just talking earlier that

7
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:15,679
just last year during the boston freedom

8
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,399
festival you were

9
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:20,399
had your first u.s marijuana arrest yeah

10
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:22,479
amazing because i've been

11
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:25,358
smoking out front for

12
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,439
we found a normal 37 years ago and i

13
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:29,279
think i wasn't as out front the first

14
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,439
four or five years but i went back

15
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:33,679
recently because i'm working on a book i

16
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,759
went back and was surprised at how

17
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:38,878
honest about my own drug use i was in

18
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:41,119
1977 so right somewhere back there i

19
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:43,679
came out front for some reason they

20
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:45,759
didn't bust me until last year at the at

21
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:48,238
the boston freedom rally and i think it

22
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:50,079
was strictly an accident i mean we

23
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:52,718
i was smoking a joint behind a booth

24
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:55,280
with the associate uh purdue associate

25
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:57,120
director at high times rick cusick and

26
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,640
we weren't trying to get arrested

27
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:01,280
otherwise i would have lit up a joint on

28
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,079
the stage we were just sharing a joint

29
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,840
so

30
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:06,079
once they arrested us they kept trying

31
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,960
to drop charges and of course we didn't

32
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:10,478
want them to drop charges

33
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:12,319
three different times they offered

34
00:01:10,478 --> 00:01:14,000
finally the judge said if we'll just pay

35
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:15,279
the court costs and our lawyer objected

36
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,799
said no we don't want to drop charity he

37
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,840
said well i'll waive the court costs and

38
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,840
our lawyer objected

39
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,400
so at any of it the judge finally

40
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,560
figured out he said ah nullification you

41
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,799
know we wanted so we ended up going to

42
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,400
trial we both took the stand under oath

43
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,159
and said of course we were smoking a

44
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,640
joint what else would you be doing at

45
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,680
the boston freedom rally it's a smoking

46
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,359
process

47
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,360
you know it's why obviously only time

48
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:42,879
once a year i go to boston is to attend

49
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:45,039
the smoke out and at any event

50
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:47,118
they ended up convicting us

51
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,960
the people in the jury pool who were

52
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:50,640
favorable were too honest one of them

53
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:52,319
even said to the judge

54
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,840
judge if they lit up a joint on the

55
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:55,839
stand i wouldn't convict them

56
00:01:56,478 --> 00:02:00,078
so all of the good people got taken out

57
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,159
of the jury post and the others didn't

58
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:03,519
have much trouble but to the judge's

59
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,920
credit he understood it was an

60
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:08,639
intellectual challenge he had no court

61
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,318
costs no fine no probation the

62
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,679
prosecutor went six months probation

63
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:13,839
because they knew they'd put us on drug

64
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,080
testing and we'd fail you know but uh

65
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,840
the judge said no no no time served we

66
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,680
we served 20 minutes when they arrested

67
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,080
the 20 minutes so it was i thought it

68
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,879
was we didn't get penalized for going to

69
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,040
trial most people in america do if you

70
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:29,759
search your rights and go to trial

71
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:31,759
tell me right you pay a penalty well you

72
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:35,120
know i went through a federal trial for

73
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:37,679
growing marijuana back in what was in 93

74
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,920
december of 93 and i was told if i

75
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,080
didn't take the plea bargain offer i was

76
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:43,759
going to get 10 years so i they offered

77
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,239
me five years that didn't really seem

78
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:48,479
like much of a bargain so i did go to

79
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:51,039
trial and i admitted i did everything

80
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:53,679
that the judge and the you know that the

81
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:56,000
prosecutor was alleging we didn't even

82
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,599
call any witnesses we did have one point

83
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,759
where they introduced my library that

84
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:02,560
turned out to be pretty beneficial to me

85
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:05,120
because when my uh defense attorney was

86
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,560
able to cross-examine the officer on the

87
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,878
stand he said pick up this book

88
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,199
marijuana your legal rights turn to page

89
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:14,799
219 and read the chapter headline the

90
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:16,799
cop picked it up he stuttered for about

91
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,280
30 40 seconds the judge said read the

92
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,239
chapter headline the

93
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,840
uh

94
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,000
my lawyer said read the chapter headline

95
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,000
he just kept stuttering finally it came

96
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,759
out it said juries can acquit defendants

97
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,759
even if they think they're guilty and it

98
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:32,318
was about six pages all about jury

99
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:33,919
nullification the prosecutor jumped up

100
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:35,919
objection objection

101
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:38,079
and the judge says oh you can't object

102
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:40,479
to your own evidence you can only object

103
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,959
to their evidence now you introduced

104
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:45,280
this evidence so you can't object to it

105
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:47,598
and it was kept in the record and i was

106
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,039
acquitted so well i would have done 10

107
00:03:47,598 --> 00:03:52,000
years and i don't really know of any

108
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:53,199
other man to win on notifications i know

109
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,560
until

110
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:58,959
until about 1880 in this country defense

111
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,039
lawyers could argue jury nullification

112
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:03,598
they can say to the jury look if you

113
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:05,359
think the defendant did is charged but

114
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:07,280
that it would not be fair to convict him

115
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,200
of a crime which would be a marijuana

116
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,959
smoker obviously most americans know it

117
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:12,878
shouldn't be a crime

118
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,400
but you can't argue that because of a

119
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:17,039
supreme court decision i think was in

120
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,798
1880 and so now what has to happen you

121
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,600
have to figure out ways to try to let

122
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:23,679
the jury know that if they're outraged

123
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,479
by this particular application of the

124
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,879
law they do not have to convict most of

125
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:30,159
i think they do yeah we just they don't

126
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:32,478
let them tell the jury unfortunately

127
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,759
that's right and i got lucky

128
00:04:32,478 --> 00:04:37,120
in the books

129
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:38,960
so the you didn't get so lucky eddie you

130
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,519
no actually uh have you been sentenced

131
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:44,319
yet no i get uh

132
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:46,399
sentenced december 21st and this in

133
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:49,040
federal court yes and to address what

134
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:50,879
you said about having the courage to

135
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,879
stand by your convictions and take it

136
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:55,040
clear to trial

137
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:58,159
two and a half years ago

138
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:01,360
when they had all four

139
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:03,759
the major components of the two warrants

140
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,360
i was looking at four life sentences 17

141
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:08,160
million dollars in fines in an

142
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,479
additional 40 years

143
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,479
prior to the udv decision which is a

144
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:13,279
major religious decision

145
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:15,918
uh

146
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:17,679
they offered me 30 months 18 months in

147
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:19,279
prison and six months and a halfway

148

home home detention

150

uh i go back to the very real

151
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:28,240
possibility on december 1st being

natural life

154
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:36,159
they're asking for a 10-year minimum at

155
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:37,439

in my life

anybody else certainly i'll still be

168
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,160
able to do

169
00:06:03,918 --> 00:06:08,639
you know i'm not going to just die but

170
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,680
the other side of it is i might as well

171
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,360
uh

172
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,800
and it's there's a lot to keep fighting

173
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:17,360
for well the judge uh was emphatic

174
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,360
after she

175
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,319
abolished me for smoking growing or

176
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:23,918
being around any marijuana she then let

177
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,600
me come up here

178
00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:27,120
and one of the points she was emphatic

179
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:30,000
about was that i let people know the

180
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,439
dangers of growing marijuana and the

181
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,560
penalties

182
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:36,079
and i will tell you quite frankly if you

183
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,639
grow marijuana

184
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:40,879
and the federal government catches you

185
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:43,038
you cannot have enough money you cannot

186
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:46,159
have enough power you cannot have enough

187
00:06:43,038 --> 00:06:49,519
friends they will destroy you

188
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:52,160
my attorneys won this case three times

189
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:55,198
the first time all of the warrants were

190
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:58,479
thrown out the judge said do not put

191
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:01,439
your lying witnesses to the prosecution

192
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:02,959
on my stand about open field

193
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:04,639
less than a month later she turned

194
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:07,279
around and allowed the open field

195
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:09,598
warrant keeping the case going

196
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:11,758
the second time we did a flawless

197
00:07:09,598 --> 00:07:14,399
presentation under the

198
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:16,160
religious freedoms restoration act

199
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:18,478
for the first five minutes the judge

200
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,319
came out agreed with every point we made

201
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:22,719
said that i was sincere that this was

202
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:25,039
religious conviction we made every point

203
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,680
that the supreme court called for she

204
00:07:25,038 --> 00:07:30,000
said that we qualified for

205
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,160
she then spent the next five minutes

206
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,038
telling the prosecutor that he had

207
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:37,280
failed on every count

208
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:40,318
he had not shown compelling interest he

209
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:42,478
had not shown least restrictive means

210
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:47,680
according to the u diva decision

211
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:51,120
at that time that case was over i won

212
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:53,519
the prosecutor submitted

213
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,280
my attorney submitted at that time as

214
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:56,878
far as i know and i'm not positive maybe

215
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:58,478
you know better but as far as i know at

216
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,319
that time the judge is supposed to take

217
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,519
everything under consideration

218
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,680
instead

219
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:05,198
this judge took it on herself to become

220
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,439
the prosecutor

221
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:09,360
explained that diversion was possible

222
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:11,360
even though the udv decision said the

223
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,879
diversion in and of itself is possible

224
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,879
at any level and therefore cannot be

225
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,720
used as a sole compelling

226
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,400
reason for a decision

227
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,080
she used it for the so compelling

228
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:22,959
decision

229
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:25,598
held holding me over again

230
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:26,478
in trial when i should have won the case

231
00:08:25,598 --> 00:08:29,120
and

232
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:31,758
when we actually went to trial

233
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:34,639
she tailored her jury instructions so

234
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:36,080
specifically and defined the crime so

235
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:38,000
specifically

236
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,000
that a gentleman that spoke to the jury

237
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,839
after the fact told me that one of the

238
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,918
ladies that he spoke to

239
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:47,120
told him with tears running down her

240
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:50,480
face that they knew i had broken no law

241
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:53,200
either state or federal

242
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:55,039
but that because of the judge's specific

243
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,278
jury instructions

244
00:08:55,039 --> 00:09:00,159
and the specific definitions that they

245
00:08:57,278 --> 00:09:01,838
were given they had no choice but to

246
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:04,480
find me guilty

247
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:07,519
and sadly in my jury pool as you alluded

248
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:10,000
to the guys that stood up and said hey

249
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:12,240
my mother died of marijuana or died of

250
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,080
cancer and used marijuana the last two

251
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,320
years it's the only thing that brought a

252
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,759
relief you're out of here let me ask you

253
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,440
something keith is there any way to kind

254
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:21,120
of exclude those kind of questions from

255
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,800
the jury say we're not going to ask them

256
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,360
about their marijuana use and you can

257
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:27,199
either i think a lot of defense lawyers

258
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:29,278
in fact don't

259
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,959
well first off in states the judge

260
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:32,720
usually does it not the defense lawyer

261
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:34,879
but in federal court the defense lawyers

262
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,399
get to do it but what i hear some of the

263
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:39,039
more experienced ones

264
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,639
will frequently waive their right to ask

265
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:43,439
questions for the very point you reign

266
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:46,000
they they sometimes think by the dress

267
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:48,000
and the way a juror acts that they can

268
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
kind of guess who's sympathetic and if

269
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,080
they ask the damn question and the juror

270
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
answers it honestly they're thrown out

271
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,759
of the pool so okay

272
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,839
a lot of lawyers think they'd rather

273
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:59,919
rely on their own instincts than ask the

274
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:02,160
questions they threw

275
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:04,399
i'm not sure how many people but at

276
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:06,159
least six to eight people out of the the

277
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,120
jury pool when they came in with 80

278
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:08,240
people

279
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,440
uh

280
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,680
nurses

281
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:14,079
yeah they threw them out threw them out

282
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:16,319
doctors threw them out anybody that had

283
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:19,120
any medical knowledge medical knowledge

284
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,800
got thrown out immediately in my case

285
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:24,560
they were pre-screened before they ever

286
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:24,559
came to the courtroom right
