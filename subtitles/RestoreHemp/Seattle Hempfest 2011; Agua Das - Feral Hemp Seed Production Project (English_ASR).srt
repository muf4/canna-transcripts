1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,839
oh yes well what we are out to do is we

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:12,260
want to grow 500 acres under a center

3
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:12,260
pivot on Navajo or Apache land

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:19,920
in order to be ready for the success

5
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:24,299
we need to have five acres growing hemp

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:27,060
seed or seed to plant 500 Acres assuming

7
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:29,278
a hundred-fold increase each year and

8
00:00:27,059 --> 00:00:32,820
the year before that we need to have

9
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:35,939
five hundredths of an acre which would

10
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:38,539
be 20 foot by 20 foot

11
00:00:35,939 --> 00:00:41,699
and the year before that we need to have

12
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:44,100
100th of that acreage which is two foot

13
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,859
by two foot which is one plant

14
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:50,340
so that means we're four years away from

15
00:00:46,859 --> 00:00:53,960
being able to grow hemp on a scale that

16
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:53,960
could have a real impact
