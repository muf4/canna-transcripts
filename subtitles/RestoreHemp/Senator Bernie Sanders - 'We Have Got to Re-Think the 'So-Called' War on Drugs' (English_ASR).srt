1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:07,199
now one of the reasons that so many

2
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:10,638
Americans are angry is they see a

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:14,280
criminal justice system which comes down

4
00:00:10,638 --> 00:00:16,518
very heavily on the poor and on people

5
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:16,518
of

6
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:28,920
color in Vermont Oregon or any place

7
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:31,358
some kid gets picked up with marijuana

8
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:34,289
that kid is likely to have a police

9
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:37,570
record for the rest of his or her

10
00:00:34,289 --> 00:00:37,570
[Music]

11
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:45,440
life but apparently if you are an

12
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:49,520
executive on Wall Street whose greed and

13
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:51,539
illegal Behavior destroyed this economy

14
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,609
nothing happens to

15
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:54,609
[Music]

16
00:00:55,479 --> 00:01:01,599
you so what Wall Street has got to learn

17
00:00:58,878 --> 00:01:04,198
and Corporate America has got to learn

18
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:08,680
is that we are going to bring Justice

19
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:08,679
back to a broken Criminal Justice

20
00:01:10,759 --> 00:01:18,280
System we have got to rethink the

21
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,280
so-called War on

22
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:31,079
Drugs it turns out turns out that over

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,989
the last 30 years Millions of Americans

24
00:01:31,078 --> 00:01:36,279
have police records for possession of

25
00:01:34,989 --> 00:01:39,199
[Music]

26
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:43,439
marijuana it turns out that the federal

27
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:48,430
controlled substance act list marijuana

28
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:50,599
is a schedule one drug right next to

29
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:53,280
[Applause]

30
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:56,679
heroin that is why I've introduced

31
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,840
legislation to take marijuana out of the

32
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:01,840
federal control substance

33
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,840
Act

34
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:14,000
but when we talk about

35
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:16,039
drugs all of us have got to recognize

36
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,280
that in my state of Vermont neighboring

37
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:22,479
the Hampshire and all over this country

38
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:23,840
we have a major crisis in terms of

39
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:26,919
opiate

40
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:31,400
addiction heroin addiction and people

41
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:34,958
dying every day from overdoses

42
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:37,200
what we have got to do as a nation is to

43
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:40,800
understand that the most effective way

44
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:44,719
to deal with drug and alcohol abuse is

45
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:47,120
not making them crimes but making them

46
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:47,120
health

47
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,080
issues
