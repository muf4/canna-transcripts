skunks your afghans

47
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,399
when we [ __ ] up that recording you

48
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,280
were talking about blueberry and how you

49
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,200
would

50
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,040
you got some blueberry you start growing

51
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,640
when you were 13.

52
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,960
you're working with skunks you're

53
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,118
working with afghanis and then all of a

54
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:02,879
sudden you're buying blueberry seeds

55
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:04,959
from a seed bank what were those

56
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:05,839
blueberries that you really liked

57
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:08,159
so

58
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,920
starting off with the the old original

59
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:12,479
varieties like from my cousins that i

60
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:14,799
agree with and stuff skunks afghans and

61
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:16,719
el skunk evolves into later you know

62
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,160
you're looking at what's hot like the

63
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:20,239
newest of the new

64
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:22,079
real exciting time we go into the widows

65
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,599
and then eventually revolve into the

66
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,599
years where the

67
00:02:23,598 --> 00:02:27,359
blue bear was coming out and

68
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:28,878
like you said you were talking about you

69
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,319
know all the excitement back then you

70
00:02:28,878 --> 00:02:32,639
know getting the money order trying to

71
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:34,799
hide not get caught just to get the damn

72
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:37,279
seeds over you know take two months or

73
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,800
whatever and we finally get these uh

74
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,120
blueberry seeds

75
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,319
i found good stuff i didn't find that

76
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,840
crazy

77
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:45,280
people used to call the blueberry yum

78
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,200
yum you know

79
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,598
but like said friends

80
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:52,079
they had a friend that i guess did you

81
00:02:49,598 --> 00:02:54,079
know you got to smoke some of that and i

82
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:57,360
mean it was off the charts

83
00:02:54,080 --> 00:03:00,800
but my favorite favorite one of all time

84
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:03,599
blue moonshine i had a blue moonshine

85
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:07,200
that was like [ __ ] drugs like

86
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:10,158
i mean just so so strong it's not so bad

87
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:11,199
it's still in my top ten list off of all

88
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:12,158
time

89
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:15,199
nice

90
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:17,120
just insane and unfortunately

91
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:18,560
um that was one of the ones like he did

92
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,400
away with because

93
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,680
i talked to him at a show one time being

94
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,959
like hey what's up with that he's like

95
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,400
oh yeah bringing it back i'm like why

96
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,158
would you have ever gotten rid of it and

97
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,719
he was like well it was it was a

98
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:31,039
stepping stone it was just a step in a

99
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:33,439
long process because you know dj he does

100
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:36,318
a lot he works the [ __ ] you know he's

101
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:39,199
not no hurry puts the work in

102
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:41,280
you know the dude dude really gets it in

103
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:43,359
so he said yeah i'm working on it so

104
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,719
that's one thing i gotta i gotta check

105
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,879
on you know he's like yeah i'd be a

106
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:49,199
couple years so like all right well it's

107
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:51,359
been a couple years for sure and for a

108
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:53,119
long year so i know you haven't been

109
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,200
going out and about socializing and

110
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,719
partying so what's up with that blue

111
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:58,238
moonshine dude

112
00:03:56,719 --> 00:04:00,799
so it was supposed like i remember the

113
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,719
description it was like the blue side of

114
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,159
the widow family or the white or he

115
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:06,239
called it the white family you know i

116
00:04:04,158 --> 00:04:09,039
know it's so much white widows

117
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:11,759
and uh my god like little kush plants

118
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:12,719
all like super super dark purple almost

119
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:14,798
black

120
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:17,439
and just this pungent

121
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:19,519
it smelled purple if that makes any

122
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:22,959
sense i mean it was like the epitome was

123
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:26,160
like the smell purple it's so pungent

124
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:26,959
man like chemical pungent funk it was

125
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,759
just

126
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:32,079
awesome it grew awesome and just the the

127
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:35,439
potency of it was just knockout i love

128
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:37,439
that [ __ ] did it take more after those

129
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:39,519
moonshine traits or did it take more

130
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:40,959
after the blue traits

131
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:43,758
it was uh

132
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:46,560
i can't really honestly speak on it

133
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:49,680
because i i never had his what he would

134
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:52,160
call like pure moonshine or any of that

135
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,959
but whatever whatever that project was i

136
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,120
mean

137
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:58,079
it was like if you had like the most

138
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:00,000
gnarly of the blueberry type

139
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:02,959
funks but more like i said just the

140
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,000
color purple man

141
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:08,719
that was the selling boy oh dude it it

142
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,560
was it was just ridiculous man and like

143
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,360
i said just so potent

144
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,360
just knockout [ __ ] man and like i would

145
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,360
that was my all-time favorite you know

146
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,560
delving into those lines you know i

147
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,960
agree that

148
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,720
i grew the great crush

149
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:26,638
and when i was the other one i grew it

150
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:28,960
was uh azor hayes i think okay tried

151
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,800
that one but yeah nothing like that blue

152
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:33,359
main show was like oh the f13 almost

153
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,038
forgot about that one but uh yeah

154
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,479
nothing like that nothing like that blue

155
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:39,120
manchan though

156
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:40,959
nice dude i feel like i don't hear you

157
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,280
talk about some of your favorite strains

158
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:45,680
you know i've heard you talk about a lot

159
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:47,758
of your cultivars very often but we

160
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,600
don't care very much about like what you

161
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,038
like and that's a big part of growing is

162
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,639
like you're taking

163
00:05:51,038 --> 00:05:54,560
other people's stock and trying to find

164
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,639
stuff out of that too right

165
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,038
yeah and that's the thing is like

166
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,960
some guys are just like all about oh i

167
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:02,560
like this so let me get c breeder a and

168
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:04,560
c b to b and i'm just going to sling it

169
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,720
together and then they'll sell seeds

170
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,879
i've never been really

171
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,039
that type of dude i do my work

172
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:12,719
and then other people's work

173
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:14,560
well that's their work and i like their

174
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,800
work you know it's it's a done deal for

175
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,120
me i'm just gonna grow it and grow and

176
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,879
smoke it but unfortunately when you

177
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,800
really get into breeding and stuff man

178
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:23,839
all your space and all your times taken

179
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,319
up with it

180
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:28,959
as far as delving into like

181
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:31,039
newer things that people make

182
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:32,879
it was all like taking a back burner for

183
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:34,719
like retirement day or something you

184
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:36,000
know and then i'm going to jump into

185
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,759
those but

186
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,600
there was a lot of stuff that i liked

187
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,199
you know just like to grow and just you

188
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,120
know smoke it so

189
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:45,038
they were just clones that were in the

190
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,639
in the room and it's like all right well

191
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:48,399
i need some more of this weed so like

192
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,639
while i'm testing out these you know a

193
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:53,038
bunch of these beans that i just made

194
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,160
in the back that corner i'll have a

195
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:56,800
whatever

196
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:59,599
just to replenish you know

197
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,680
i feel like it's fair to say though

198
00:06:59,598 --> 00:07:04,560
out of everything that you appreciate

199
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:07,439
you're more into the gassy skunky rotten

200
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,800
type offensive [ __ ] would that be right

201
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:10,879
yeah i like

202
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:14,079
and i have such an appreciation for all

203
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:15,680
of it but yeah i tend to go toward

204
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:16,959
he said sour

205
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,120
kim

206
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:22,399
type funk you know that that's typically

207
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:24,800
the way my my hand always goes

208
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:27,120
but equally to that

209
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,079
i do like those like really really

210
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,800
potent

211
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:33,680
purples and like those hash punches

212
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,439
really narcotic hash plants that's

213
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,720
definitely something i wanted to talk to

214
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:38,719
you about

215
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,680
yeah man that's that's another big one

216
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,199
for me

217
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,199
but then like when i'm talking like

218
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:45,199
hazes and you know [ __ ] like that you

219
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:48,319
know that's a whole another

220
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:50,319
you know frankincense funk like man i

221
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:52,000
honestly man really i'm all over the

222
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:53,439
place but i guess

223
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,680
you know when it comes to the evening

224
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:57,759
time the night time yeah it's like it's

225
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,079
going more toward that uh you know what

226
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:02,000
people say like the gassy side of things

227
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:04,159
i'm going towards those real narcotic

228
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,839
hash plants that have more

229
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,560
i mean some of them are like that too

230
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:10,878
but my favorite one was more

231
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,360
they said in that purple flavored uh

232
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:16,160
realm of things

233
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,400
so speaking on hash plans

234
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,919
back in the day i told you earlier two

235
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:22,000
of the ones that we grew from you that

236
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:22,959
we loved were the munson

237
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,199
and

238
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:28,239
the most memorable for me is the polecat

239
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:31,280
91 yeah that's a good one that pull cat

240
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,080
91 that had skelly hash plan in it right

241
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:35,278
yeah

242
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:37,519
and see skelly hash plant i've heard the

243
00:08:35,278 --> 00:08:39,278
puck a million times

244
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:41,679
but that was a little bit beyond my time

245
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:42,958
i think the only thing that i've had it

246
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:45,599
in is

247
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:48,239
your polecat 91 can you tell us a little

248
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,839
bit more about skelly and what made that

249
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,680
hash plant so

250
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:53,040
popular and wanted

251
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:55,679
yeah so

252
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:56,719
normally out there like especially in

253
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:58,719
the

254
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,759
breeding world and stuff like that or

255
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,200
like the

256
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:02,799
people that might not be breeding but

257
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,959
they're like the extreme growers

258
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:06,399
actually keep track of all the all the

259
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:07,439
genetics being made and sold and

260
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:10,159
everything

261
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,680
anytime there's anything out there where

262
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:13,519
anybody says

263
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:15,599
nah man you can't have it

264
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:18,320
it is it makes them go [ __ ] well

265
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,320
that's all literally

266
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:22,399
dude

267
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:24,719
what was mine i was like

268
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:27,039
the old dealer's trick

269
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,560
no you can't have that jar man i'll

270
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:30,399
[ __ ] make something i'm just going to

271
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:31,759
grow up the pictures talk about how

272
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:35,759
awesome it is and when people are like

273
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:35,759
oh i want to see like nah nah

274
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,360
and then people go wild and then all you

275
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,879
got to do is let one clone out to

276
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,200
somebody you know he's going to give it

277
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:48,720
away all right and then when you do that

278
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,879
be like whatever you do don't give it to

279
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,639
anybody right and within the year it

280
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:54,559
should be in like you know ten thousand

281
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:56,480
different hands

282
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:58,319
somebody's gonna have two parts of it

283
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,240
and then at that point that's when you

284
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,278
drop the seeds and then you just cash

285
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,079
out

286
00:10:01,278 --> 00:10:03,039
like

287
00:10:02,078 --> 00:10:04,559
you know

288
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:05,679
you know that that would be just the

289
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:07,359
ultimate

290
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:08,958
[ __ ] you know what i mean just to

291
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,740
show like

292
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:12,879
[ __ ] duke dropping tips

293
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:15,200
[Laughter]

294
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:16,559
so yeah i mean there's that but

295
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:20,640
all that aside

296
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:23,199
it is super super super [ __ ] dang man

297
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:24,639
it's just [ __ ] awesome

298
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,480
it's one of those hatch plants that

299
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:30,240
leads them up lanes on that

300
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:31,600
just rotten gassy nasty or rag type type

301
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,278
side of things

302
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,519
extremely potent

303
00:10:33,278 --> 00:10:38,240
that just slow as [ __ ]

304
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:40,480
barely even stretches when you flower it

305
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,600
but man it's just

306
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,120
amazing

307
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,639
and

308
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,120
when i was talking

309
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:48,399
to mike and everything and his you know

310
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,720
the dude that

311
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:53,039
originally got the seeds over in holland

312
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:56,000
and they came back with it uh hidden in

313
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:57,679
a sewn into a sweater and all that [ __ ]

314
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,480
it was uh

315
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:01,039
because

316
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,879
they got it or whatever before cincy was

317
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:03,919
doing the [ __ ] with neville so it should

318
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:07,360
have been

319
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:08,639
uh neville's uh hash blank stock oh wow

320
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:12,000
which was

321
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:13,679
i think it was like an nl2 nl2 nl1 and

322
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,519
something else man

323
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:17,519
my brain's been a little a little hazy

324
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,720
here lately i don't know like if you

325
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,159
yeah i mean you got the power of the

326
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,000
internet right you can look up the whole

327
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:24,879
c bank catalogs

328
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,639
and bean brains could correct me too he

329
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:28,639
even sent me like little catalogs with

330
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:30,000
her at home but i remember it was like a

331
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:31,278
heavy you know

332
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,600
an old base

333
00:11:31,278 --> 00:11:34,958
and um anyways they come over here

334
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,639
they're growing it

335
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:38,239
and you know it stood the test of time

336
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:40,000
and typically anything that's that old

337
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,000
and stands the test of time you know

338
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,879
there's a there's a damn good reason for

339
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,120
it

340
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:47,120
so having that heavy

341
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,120
nl base

342
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,480
that was a one good reason and just the

343
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,639
fact that it just

344
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,800
it's awesome it's it's got what uh what

345
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:57,440
i like and what i want

346
00:11:54,799 --> 00:12:00,000
the other side to it is like

347
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,120
my own personal beliefs you know like

348
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,600
i've heard

349
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,759
a billion or one stories about him from

350
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,720
here come from there come from here from

351
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:10,958
there yep i've always believed that that

352
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,160
chem is a derivative of that

353
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:15,119
so

354
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:16,480
sticking with that uh that got i always

355
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,000
thought that i was like well maybe it

356
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:21,120
was like an l skunk

357
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,360
that was you know producing that hit it

358
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,360
and and that's you know the derivative

359
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,680
so i felt like all right

360
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:30,320
if i'm going to work in this gene pool i

361
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:32,239
want to encapsulate as much as i can

362
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,920
of of that

363
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,399
into this hybrid right

364
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:37,360
which is going to be gnarly funk

365
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,799
and

366
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:42,639
really good potency so that was the that

367
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:44,399
was kind of the

368
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,680
the starting point

369
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,919
of um

370
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:50,078
of doing that that whole that whole

371
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:53,120
project so that way

372
00:12:50,078 --> 00:12:55,359
eventually i have a dominion skunk male

373
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:58,000
which you know it was a was a hybrid it

374
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,879
had you know all the all the core genes

375
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
in it

376
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:04,000
and then i could use that to start

377
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,360
to start hitting anything that was that

378
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,639
was kim

379
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,480
and then

380
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:10,320
i did another project

381
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:13,120
that was i was trying to hit any

382
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:15,360
basically anything chem og with it which

383
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,360
was a 54 mail

384
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:20,399
so like i wanted to have those those

385
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,360
things and work them to the to the way

386
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,000
where

387
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,720
i'm i'm keeping the funk i'm keeping the

388
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,159
uh and keeping that the good qualities

389
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,720
that gene pool

390
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:33,278
good strong branching and everything to

391
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,600
you know go along with that rad potency

392
00:13:33,278 --> 00:13:38,320
and really good gnarly nose on

393
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:40,720
everything so that was kind of

394
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:43,360
kind of that whole project to finally

395
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:45,920
hit that hit that end goal

396
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,360
and uh the pole cat and then the polecat

397
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:48,799
bx

398
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,639
were definitely

399
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:51,838
definitely up there

400
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,680
on the uh

401
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:55,600
on the charts with the nose and the

402
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:57,359
potency and everything so it worked out

403
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,360
pretty damn good

404
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,278
i really missed that one i gotta say

405
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,759
that was by far one of my favorite

406
00:14:01,278 --> 00:14:06,399
outdoor plants of all time [ __ ] yeah

407
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:08,240
dude we would top i i had a patron

408
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:10,399
member ask me earlier

409
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,720
they heard about your tips on high

410
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:14,639
stress training low stress training they

411
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,560
want to know like if there's certain

412
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:18,240
cultivars that you recommend a certain

413
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:19,439
amount of training on or a certain type

414
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,440
of training

415
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,639
and they said they had a

416
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,040
pole cat

417
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:27,360
out crossing from you i don't think he

418
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:29,120
mentioned what cross it was but i said

419
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,360
if it's anything like the original pole

420
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:34,159
cat and you're doing it outdoors top at

421
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:36,079
once super crop the lowers and then just

422
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:38,000
keep everything even and it's gonna

423
00:14:36,078 --> 00:14:40,000
produce like hell for you

424
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,600
oh yeah for sure man

425
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,639
and that's like another little tip for

426
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,639
like

427
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:47,120
anybody growing out there

428
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:49,519
and it was something that you know

429
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,959
i learned this early on

430
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:53,120
growing out different things especially

431
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:55,439
when you're growing from clone

432
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,360
say like you know our first

433
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,760
go around we're just like all right you

434
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:02,000
know we're just going to uh we're just

435
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:04,240
going to go for the pillow

436
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,679
for the for the topping

437
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,480
so you top it

438
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:08,000
and

439
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,680
you know everything's kind of little but

440
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,839
let's say like you don't you don't you

441
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:13,599
don't call it you go again and this time

442
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:15,920
you super cropping you know oh wow all

443
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,839
the flowers are like really big

444
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:19,360
some things don't

445
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:21,519
respond well

446
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,959
to like the multi-cola

447
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,759
type training right

448
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:27,039
right

449
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:28,799
so like a good example of it was the 88

450
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:30,719
g13 hash plant

451
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:32,639
if you super crop it a little bit and

452
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,720
get the lower branches to kind of come

453
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:37,039
up toward the top and keep them about

454
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:39,440
four to six inches below the apex of it

455
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:40,719
you know the very tip of the top

456
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,880
you would do great

457
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,720
now if you punched it again and got

458
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:47,039
everything even or if you topped it

459
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,800
early on your yield would go down below

460
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:51,599
half of what you would have got

461
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:53,919
and those growth options which are the

462
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,720
what it send into the apex you know says

463
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:56,559
like

464
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:59,278
you get the most you get the lion's

465
00:15:56,559 --> 00:16:00,319
share of my energy right now

466
00:15:59,278 --> 00:16:02,000
when you

467
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,680
have to divvy it up

468
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,600
across a whole bunch of different tops

469
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:07,519
it's like some of these plants like they

470
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,360
just get confused or something you know

471
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:11,278
they get a little worked up over it and

472
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,680
you don't end up getting it now some

473
00:16:11,278 --> 00:16:16,320
plants you can have 12 tops and you're

474
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:18,078
going to get 12 equally large colas and

475
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,320
it's going to do very well for you and

476
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:23,198
then some of them it does nothing or

477
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,920
some cases it even did get worse

478
00:16:23,198 --> 00:16:25,758
so

479
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:28,159
what i always say is like when you grow

480
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:31,360
out when you grow up from seed

481
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:33,278
kind of go not all natural but

482
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,639
just you know do the do the super

483
00:16:33,278 --> 00:16:36,639
cropping enough to where you're getting

484
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:38,000
the lowers up near the top

485
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:40,320
and

486
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,198
do your first run like that find your

487
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,639
winner right and then once you got that

488
00:16:43,198 --> 00:16:46,240
and you're gonna move forward and now

489
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:49,039
it's the next run

490
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:51,919
you know try like one clone you know

491
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:53,838
top which i have one clone super crop

492
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:56,000
you know like like you normally would

493
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:58,399
and then do another one you know with

494
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,480
multiple tops you know five six ten

495
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:03,039
however many types you want and see how

496
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:05,199
it responds then that way

497
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:07,038
you're kind of dialing it in

498
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:09,199
you know how you're gonna

499
00:17:07,038 --> 00:17:10,798
have your space management go down and

500
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:13,279
then that way you know you can

501
00:17:10,798 --> 00:17:14,798
predictably say okay well i'm gonna need

502
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:16,078
you know this much square footage for

503
00:17:14,798 --> 00:17:18,480
each one of these plants they're gonna

504
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:21,359
give me give or take about this amount

505
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:23,439
and it responds what best in in this way

506
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:24,879
and you know i do that at the same time

507
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:26,240
as you would you know dialing in your

508
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:29,840
feeds

509
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:31,839
and also like your your job times too

510
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:35,038
because my first few runs i'll play

511
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:36,798
around give or take a couple days before

512
00:17:35,038 --> 00:17:39,519
during and after

513
00:17:36,798 --> 00:17:41,359
to really really dial in that that chop

514
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:43,119
date you know to see

515
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:44,558
if that potency really spikes because

516
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:46,319
some things man they have like a little

517
00:17:44,558 --> 00:17:48,399
short window where [ __ ] really really

518
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:50,240
spikes and peaks very high

519
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,480
it's great and potent before and after

520
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,960
but there's these little windows where

521
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,880
should it make you snatch off sweat and

522
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,720
you know that's ultimately we want the

523
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,559
best possible right so

524
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,000
play around with these things and then

525
00:18:00,558 --> 00:18:03,440
that way you you know something you're

526
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,880
going to keep you know you you really

527
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,798
got that thing dialed in so you're

528
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,720
making the best of your your space

529
00:18:06,798 --> 00:18:12,160
management and you're getting the best

530
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:14,240
possible outcome at the end you know

531
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,720
dude that's a perfect tip for new

532
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:19,440
growers right there take that same clone

533
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:21,839
that you like grow it in as many ways

534
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:24,720
possible and see how it responds best

535
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:26,639
yeah mind your six ps right

536
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,640
yeah proper planning prevents poor

537
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,640
performance

538
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:38,079
another thing that you talk about is

539
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:40,400
something that i talk to my patrons

540
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:42,480
about very often you say it a little bit

541
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,880
different than me you talk about reading

542
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,079
a plant sign language right what does

543
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,880
that mean

544
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:49,038
so

545
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,799
no obviously they can't speak and if the

546
00:18:49,038 --> 00:18:53,119
plants does start talking to you and

547
00:18:50,798 --> 00:18:57,400
you're hearing a language and

548
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:57,399
uh you might want to put the mushrooms

549
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:04,480
damn it that's what's going on and i get

550
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:06,319
it man it was speaking [ __ ] clown

551
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,440
might make it out man

552
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:10,319
but um

553
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,919
so i always kind of related it to like

554
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:14,720
you know they can't verbally speak but

555
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:16,559
they can speak through sign language so

556
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,720
it's up to us to

557
00:19:16,558 --> 00:19:19,519
know the the best way to to understand

558
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,720
that

559
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:25,038
and i would kind of like relate it to

560
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:27,440
if you've known somebody long enough and

561
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:29,359
you notice like they look a certain way

562
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:32,320
or act in a certain way that they might

563
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:34,479
be hungry or they're hot or whatever so

564
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:36,960
like the same like social cues like to

565
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,798
use with another human being

566
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,640
and more in particular a human being

567
00:19:38,798 --> 00:19:42,319
like that you hang around a lot you

568
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,600
might notice a little subtle subtle

569
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:45,759
little thing so

570
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:48,079
same type deal like you know know what

571
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:50,720
know what your deficiencies look like

572
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:53,918
know what your toxicities look like

573
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:56,240
understand about light sensitivity

574
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:58,320
and know what 100

575
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,400
super healthy looks like

576
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:02,960
so you can you can kind of have a have a

577
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,480
gauge a gauge on that so that way you're

578
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,480
knowing like

579
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,240
you know the the perfect sweet spots for

580
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,960
like watering because you know if you're

581
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:13,759
doing your soil thing um i noticed like

582
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:16,798
a lot of people over over water like has

583
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:19,200
like a huge huge problem so not over

584
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:20,960
watering and knowing like the right

585
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,038
amount to give them for like what they

586
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,640
need for that period of time and knowing

587
00:20:23,038 --> 00:20:26,640
when to give it to them you know and

588
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:29,360
then looking at the angle of how the

589
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,799
leaves are pointing up or flat or

590
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:32,558
less than

591
00:20:30,798 --> 00:20:35,038
parallel with the floor you know when

592
00:20:32,558 --> 00:20:36,558
they start to come down past that point

593
00:20:35,038 --> 00:20:37,440
knowing knowing these little things and

594
00:20:36,558 --> 00:20:39,599
knowing

595
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,960
what you know uh you know yellow leaves

596
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:43,038
starting at the bottom aren't knowing

597
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:45,038
what a little rough spot is become

598
00:20:43,038 --> 00:20:46,798
familiar with all these things and

599
00:20:45,038 --> 00:20:48,558
essentially you're learning their

600
00:20:46,798 --> 00:20:49,839
language right and then that way you

601
00:20:48,558 --> 00:20:51,678
know how to

602
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:52,879
better handle your problems if there is

603
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:54,798
a problem

604
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:57,360
and then once you start to learn these

605
00:20:54,798 --> 00:20:59,519
uh these different things

606
00:20:57,359 --> 00:21:01,038
know how to deal with them accordingly

607
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:02,720
if you're an organic grower know how to

608
00:21:01,038 --> 00:21:03,839
do it organically

609
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,839
and

610
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:07,519
don't limit yourself to knowing like oh

611
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:08,879
i need a bottle of

612
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:11,119
whatever like

613
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:13,200
you know like you know there's a bunch

614
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:15,839
of ways you know you like one could even

615
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:18,240
get calcium i had a buddy that uh in a

616
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:21,678
pinch he crushed up a bunch of toms oh

617
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:24,079
damn yeah that's actually [ __ ] jesus

618
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:25,840
yeah so like you know if you're in a

619
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:28,240
pinch and a lot of that you know it

620
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:30,240
comes from growing up in an illegal

621
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,640
world where i can't go to a grocery

622
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,319
store i'm gonna get [ __ ] indicted if

623
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,400
i go to this [ __ ] story you know i'm

624
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:38,558
like yeah i just can't do it i can't

625
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,798
order things yeah you have to be able to

626
00:21:38,558 --> 00:21:43,359
know your own thing so

627
00:21:40,798 --> 00:21:44,639
that knowledge came from there but

628
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:45,839
you know there's there's a whole bunch

629
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,919
of different ways and that's the thing

630
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:50,639
is like you might have

631
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:52,480
this dolomite lime that you

632
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,720
you know made a slurry with and broke it

633
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,720
down some microbes and [ __ ] now you're

634
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,640
you're using that but you know you might

635
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,159
not be able to get out and he's like oh

636
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,799
man i need to

637
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:04,480
get a little calcium boost real quick

638
00:22:02,798 --> 00:22:05,679
and you don't have any but you know it's

639
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,200
really needed maybe you're out in the

640
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:08,320
20s it's going to be a while before you

641
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,600
can get out

642
00:22:08,319 --> 00:22:12,960
hey man you saw a roll of [ __ ] toms

643
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:15,279
you know and you're like all right cool

644
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:17,200
you know you you could potentially use

645
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:19,519
that you know so there's there's a lot

646
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,600
of i wouldn't recommend it of course you

647
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:24,639
know but if you had to

648
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:26,558
you had an alternative so like no

649
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:29,440
in a pinch

650
00:22:26,558 --> 00:22:31,279
when in rome right

651
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,960
right right so

652
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:35,200
you know you gotta you gotta know know

653
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:37,120
your alternatives and and things like

654
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,080
that like bray rabbit molasses for

655
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:40,479
instance

656
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:43,038
[ __ ] ton of calcium in that [ __ ] ton of

657
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:44,640
calcium in that so that gives you give

658
00:22:43,038 --> 00:22:47,119
you a little boost there it's got some

659
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,400
iron and some other goodies in there as

660
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:51,918
well so

661
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:53,440
you know just be uh well versed in uh

662
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:55,440
what to do

663
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,519
according to what this plant is trying

664
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:00,309
to tell you you know what i mean

665
00:22:57,519 --> 00:23:03,460
so you know the more you know right

666
00:23:00,309 --> 00:23:03,460
[Music]

667
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:08,240
the more you know yeah

668
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:09,599
no that's i i love how you explain that

669
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:13,038
because that's a big thing that i tell

670
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:16,639
my patrons i call it reading your plants

671
00:23:13,038 --> 00:23:18,640
and it's it's basically exactly how you

672
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:21,679
described it i would say watering

673
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:24,080
practices are the number one killer of

674
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:26,320
plants for new growers absolutely it's

675
00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:28,639
the hardest thing for them to learn but

676
00:23:26,319 --> 00:23:31,119
after that it's just understanding

677
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,799
mobile and immobile nutrients

678
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:34,959
understanding what your nutrients are

679
00:23:32,798 --> 00:23:37,519
and what they do for your plant right

680
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:39,919
yep you're environmental and

681
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:42,158
and the one other big one i would add to

682
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:43,278
it is understanding the difference

683
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:45,520
between

684
00:23:43,278 --> 00:23:48,319
plant available

685
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:51,200
and not available yeah things that can

686
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:53,278
be taken up and then things that really

687
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,960
need to be broken down and what it takes

688
00:23:53,278 --> 00:23:56,400
to break those down

689
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,759
so

690
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,240
knowing that

691
00:23:57,759 --> 00:24:02,798
will also help with you know doing doing

692
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,599
things but it's also going to help you

693
00:24:02,798 --> 00:24:05,200
with

694
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:06,158
uh you know another thing i've always

695
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,519
said with

696
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:10,960
growing

697
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:12,960
especially myself which is weird as [ __ ]

698
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,079
it's like the like the the horse and the

699
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,000
carrot

700
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:18,319
you gotta push them a little bit you

701
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:21,119
know to get them to do do exactly what

702
00:24:18,319 --> 00:24:23,038
you want to really really excel

703
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:24,000
so you have to lead them along

704
00:24:23,038 --> 00:24:27,119
and

705
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,079
you need to know why things happen

706
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:30,558
and

707
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:33,678
what causes these things to happen

708
00:24:30,558 --> 00:24:36,558
and that way you can say okay

709
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:38,320
well if higher uv light is going to

710
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:40,879
trigger a response

711
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:42,639
for for more oil production right

712
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:45,919
we can say okay

713
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:48,880
oh we can give it more uv right now we

714
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:51,120
need to know how can we best facilitate

715
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,799
this so now we know how to trigger it

716
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:53,918
but we need to know how to facilitate

717
00:24:52,798 --> 00:24:56,319
that right

718
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:58,240
so if you know like okay well now it's

719
00:24:56,319 --> 00:25:00,158
about that time so we're going to crank

720
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,679
the lights up a little bit higher now

721
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:02,720
i'm going to start you know feeding it

722
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:04,559
something for a little more oil

723
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,839
production and understand that it's kind

724
00:25:04,558 --> 00:25:07,759
of like a

725
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:09,918
not like a super stress but it's like a

726
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:11,599
stress response so uh when they're

727
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:14,240
stressed they produce little bits of

728
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:16,558
salicylic acid so let's help him out

729
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,798
once he's like alloy water right that's

730
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:21,678
got a [ __ ] ton of salicylic acid

731
00:25:18,798 --> 00:25:24,079
so let's facilitate the stress response

732
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:26,159
what they need to produce more oil

733
00:25:24,079 --> 00:25:27,359
and you know trigger it

734
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:28,720
and deliver

735
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:30,319
and then that way you know with all

736
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:33,038
these other little things

737
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:35,359
you can kind of lead them along the path

738
00:25:33,038 --> 00:25:38,400
that you want

739
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:41,278
yep absolutely that's definitely a great

740
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:43,200
tip again is [ __ ] understanding plant

741
00:25:41,278 --> 00:25:45,278
stages and what they're using at those

742
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,840
different stages right

743
00:25:45,278 --> 00:25:50,798
awesome and you're also a big

744
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:52,480
no-till organic guy right

745
00:25:50,798 --> 00:25:54,319
why what got you into that you've tried

746
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:57,360
hydro haven't you

747
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:59,678
oh yeah yeah i grew uh your hydra back

748
00:25:57,359 --> 00:26:01,119
in the day because of uh

749
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:03,919
allegedly

750
00:26:01,119 --> 00:26:07,959
allegedly i love that word

751
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:07,960
i say that one a lot allegedly

752
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:14,400
yeah so it's like you know to go to a

753
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:16,480
bunch of a bunch of different places

754
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,240
that are all over the state like it's

755
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:21,278
just not feasible so you have to have

756
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:23,200
things automated and everything

757
00:26:21,278 --> 00:26:25,759
so that was like the the best way to do

758
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:28,720
it you know we've done you know you know

759
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:30,960
drippers you know drain drained waste

760
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,720
recycles doing rockwool

761
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:35,600
done cocoa

762
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:39,919
evan flow and hydrocorals you know

763
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:39,918
and my buddy used to call hydra wow

764
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:45,038
clay pellets you know right

765
00:26:42,558 --> 00:26:46,240
yeah i've grown about every every way

766
00:26:45,038 --> 00:26:47,359
you can think

767
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,200
but

768
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:51,519
grown in soil

769
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,840
without a doubt always got my my best

770
00:26:51,519 --> 00:26:56,558
quality and i wasn't really sacrificing

771
00:26:53,839 --> 00:26:59,678
much on the on the heel department

772
00:26:56,558 --> 00:27:02,158
i'm just i'm not into smoking rock hard

773
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:03,679
he just doesn't burn good for me

774
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:05,520
and i'm not uh

775
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:07,038
i'm nuts because like the thing is like

776
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:09,200
it'll be like oh it's black ash what

777
00:27:07,038 --> 00:27:11,919
like i mean you do hydroponics correctly

778
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:14,240
like it'd have a white ash but

779
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:17,038
you know it just wasn't wasn't wasn't my

780
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:19,519
jam flavonoids terpenes weren't weren't

781
00:27:17,038 --> 00:27:21,278
there like they were in the soil

782
00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:23,599
i might you know i'm gonna finish a

783
00:27:21,278 --> 00:27:25,919
little bit quicker i'm with you

784
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:28,158
but man if i'm already going you know 60

785
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:30,720
something days or whatever like you know

786
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:32,159
a few handful of days ain't gonna hurt

787
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,360
me when it comes to

788
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:34,880
you know

789
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:36,558
the quality of the end product and

790
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,640
ultimately for me

791
00:27:36,558 --> 00:27:40,720
that was my um

792
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:43,038
you know that's that's my that's my jam

793
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,319
you know so back in those days

794
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:46,558
early days

795
00:27:44,319 --> 00:27:47,759
of uh alleged

796
00:27:46,558 --> 00:27:50,639
pumping

797
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:52,798
you know it was fine but

798
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:55,840
it was just out of out of that necessity

799
00:27:52,798 --> 00:27:59,119
and that necessity only right

800
00:27:55,839 --> 00:28:00,639
so yeah like for me personally

801
00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:02,398
and especially the way the world is

802
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:05,278
today it's like i don't i don't have

803
00:28:02,398 --> 00:28:07,038
those worries so yeah i can i can just

804
00:28:05,278 --> 00:28:10,079
do do my soul thing

805
00:28:07,038 --> 00:28:11,839
so aside from the quality and [ __ ] just

806
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:15,119
the ease of it man

807
00:28:11,839 --> 00:28:17,678
just the the flat out ease of growth

808
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:19,278
it's cheaper it's just easier all the

809
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:20,399
way around you know

810
00:28:19,278 --> 00:28:22,319
and

811
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:23,759
especially like after the first run you

812
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:25,200
know you've you know you've already paid

813
00:28:23,759 --> 00:28:26,720
for that soil you know and then you can

814
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:29,759
just rock and roll

815
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:31,200
in it in it again you know if the soil

816
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:33,599
was

817
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,278
really really set up for that

818
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:38,480
as far as like the no-till it's like

819
00:28:35,278 --> 00:28:40,558
yeah i'm not definitely not telling but

820
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:42,159
when somebody said that to me years ago

821
00:28:40,558 --> 00:28:44,079
i was like yeah yeah and they're like oh

822
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:46,080
what cover crops are you running i was

823
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:48,319
like oh no i'm

824
00:28:46,079 --> 00:28:50,079
doing that i'm doing my thing inside

825
00:28:48,319 --> 00:28:52,079
yeah like oh yeah yeah we know like what

826
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:53,678
cover cross here and i was like oh i

827
00:28:52,079 --> 00:28:55,199
don't do that like what about your mulch

828
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:57,440
there i was like well i stripped down

829
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,960
the lower third of my plant like i mess

830
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,240
it up with scissors

831
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,319
and i put that

832
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:04,480
yeah man i'll throw some bokashi on it

833
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:06,240
maybe some earthworm castings and

834
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:08,798
let it go to town and

835
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:10,640
it does that does pretty awesome

836
00:29:08,798 --> 00:29:12,480
but i don't i don't grow

837
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:14,799
you know another

838
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:16,798
another crop crap on it and it's just

839
00:29:14,798 --> 00:29:18,319
that's just my style you know

840
00:29:16,798 --> 00:29:21,038
i've tried it

841
00:29:18,319 --> 00:29:22,079
it was just adding add to my into my

842
00:29:21,038 --> 00:29:23,919
workload

843
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:26,240
so just mulching with my when i'm

844
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:27,520
stripping you know that was always good

845
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:30,159
enough for me

846
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:32,798
and every now and again i'm top dressing

847
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:34,799
a few things just to keep levels of

848
00:29:32,798 --> 00:29:38,000
certain things up

849
00:29:34,798 --> 00:29:39,759
i'm not real big on overloading the soil

850
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,919
like with everything

851
00:29:39,759 --> 00:29:44,319
in existence you know

852
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:46,320
a lot of those things like i really want

853
00:29:44,319 --> 00:29:47,119
to keep in my control

854
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:49,439
so

855
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:51,439
some guys throw it down [ __ ] thumbs

856
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:53,440
alfalfa and kelp

857
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,960
and they're like you know writing in the

858
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:57,278
mix and

859
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:59,200
i'm gonna come in with the yeah

860
00:29:57,278 --> 00:30:00,558
it kind of smells like [ __ ] green

861
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,558
grass

862
00:30:00,558 --> 00:30:05,038
kind of burns my throat i'm like yeah

863
00:30:02,558 --> 00:30:07,038
dude that's that's that's

864
00:30:05,038 --> 00:30:09,278
it right there and it's like you know

865
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:11,679
something that's not mentioning on that

866
00:30:09,278 --> 00:30:13,759
bag of whatever that you know banana is

867
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:16,000
the you know the plant growth regulators

868
00:30:13,759 --> 00:30:16,798
you know they're organic you know

869
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,960
but

870
00:30:16,798 --> 00:30:21,038
the uh you know there's pgrs that are

871
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:23,919
that are in there you know so

872
00:30:21,038 --> 00:30:25,519
uh trichatinol and the alfalfa is giving

873
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:28,720
that nice green

874
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:30,879
grass [ __ ] funk to it so there's that

875
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:32,798
and then that acetone there's sodium now

876
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,640
the kelp is really uh

877
00:30:32,798 --> 00:30:37,200
really doing it up for you on the

878
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:39,200
smoothness you know so it's like don't

879
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,880
don't load your [ __ ] down with

880
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,399
everything under the sun

881
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,640
you have it in your room but like you

882
00:30:42,398 --> 00:30:47,599
know brew it make it use it when it's

883
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:49,278
needed no and

884
00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:51,119
yes you can make it available and you

885
00:30:49,278 --> 00:30:54,159
can give it then yeah and just because

886
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:55,599
it's good and veg and you're gonna bloom

887
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:57,519
don't feed that [ __ ] through the whole

888
00:30:55,599 --> 00:30:59,759
volume cycle like you're inhibiting a

889
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:01,679
lot of a lot of things doing it too then

890
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:03,038
that goes back to like educating

891
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:05,120
yourself like

892
00:31:03,038 --> 00:31:08,158
why does this do what it does and what

893
00:31:05,119 --> 00:31:11,439
is actually going on other than like oh

894
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:15,039
it worked it did good plant looked happy

895
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:19,080
you know like not like

896
00:31:15,038 --> 00:31:19,079
the beginner grower notes

897
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:23,220
i remember taking those notes yep good

898
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:24,558
watered happy

899
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:26,798
[Laughter]

900
00:31:24,558 --> 00:31:30,319
yeah plant green plant

901
00:31:26,798 --> 00:31:30,319
plant green plant good yeah

902
00:31:31,359 --> 00:31:33,839
that's awesome

903
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:36,320
so

904
00:31:33,839 --> 00:31:37,839
i'm a big organic guy too i haven't

905
00:31:36,319 --> 00:31:39,759
[ __ ] around with hydra i'm one of the

906
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:41,839
only organic growers i know that's never

907
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:45,440
touched hydro in his life

908
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:48,240
yeah but i went from using like a mostly

909
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:50,798
organic synganic like bald nutrient

910
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:52,240
system it was horrible it was

911
00:31:50,798 --> 00:31:54,240
they had like [ __ ]

912
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,200
eight thirteen balls or some [ __ ] like

913
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,599
that

914
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:01,038
it was just yeah it was just ridiculous

915
00:31:57,599 --> 00:32:01,038
i went from that i got

916
00:32:01,759 --> 00:32:05,839
the ph down that was the worst that was

917
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:07,759
the worst yeah

918
00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:09,220
three drops out we're way the [ __ ] out

919
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:10,640
now god damn it

920
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:14,079
[Laughter]

921
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:17,038
i look like lemon juice man perfect

922
00:32:14,079 --> 00:32:21,038
now yes now i'm using lemon juice but

923
00:32:17,038 --> 00:32:23,119
before i i moved into top dressing

924
00:32:21,038 --> 00:32:25,919
and after that i really got into k f

925
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:29,278
practices if you're familiar with that

926
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:31,200
oh very very familiar man that it works

927
00:32:29,278 --> 00:32:32,159
and there's there's books

928
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,159
yes

929
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:36,240
that are available to the public for

930
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:38,240
anybody listening it's not

931
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:40,798
something you know secret like you

932
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:42,880
should get those learn those and and

933
00:32:40,798 --> 00:32:45,278
understand why those things are doing

934
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:47,360
good it's the same thing like with toms

935
00:32:45,278 --> 00:32:48,480
or whatever like no like you can find

936
00:32:47,359 --> 00:32:50,319
nutrients

937
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:52,240
literally all over the place just you

938
00:32:50,319 --> 00:32:53,599
know fermenting them or you know

939
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,278
breaking them down

940
00:32:53,599 --> 00:32:57,278
in other other ways

941
00:32:55,278 --> 00:32:59,359
it's there you know and you can really

942
00:32:57,278 --> 00:33:02,000
do some cool [ __ ]

943
00:32:59,359 --> 00:33:04,000
yes so i have a couple questions for you

944
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,319
on that i

945
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,240
went from using knf

946
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:10,158
and every

947
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:12,240
run i would take my soil out i would

948
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:13,600
re-amend it like you were saying just

949
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:16,000
throw it in there because it's good for

950
00:33:13,599 --> 00:33:17,119
veg right

951
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,519
and uh

952
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:21,599
now i'm getting bigger pots i'm growing

953
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:23,359
in beds i'm doing stuff like this and

954
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:26,639
i'm trying to do the no-till

955
00:33:23,359 --> 00:33:28,639
hand-in-hand incorporated with the k nf

956
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:31,600
are you getting your soil tested after

957
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:34,480
each run do you gauge it

958
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:38,079
what type of organic growing are you

959
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:41,038
using in conjunction with your no-till

960
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:43,678
as far as like testing goes

961
00:33:41,038 --> 00:33:46,158
for the longest time that was just

962
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:48,240
just not a practical thing that that was

963
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:50,000
going to happen for me

964
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:52,798
out here

965
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,558
especially like when the cbd ship went

966
00:33:52,798 --> 00:33:56,558
super crazy

967
00:33:54,558 --> 00:33:58,319
and that's okay and it's you know it's

968
00:33:56,558 --> 00:34:00,079
all legit and everything you started

969
00:33:58,319 --> 00:34:01,759
getting a lot of these ad companies that

970
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:04,000
were coming out you're like oh yeah

971
00:34:01,759 --> 00:34:05,759
we'll test your soul test your soul and

972
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,960
at that point that's when i was like

973
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:11,199
okay yeah i can i can test this because

974
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:12,800
you know like i'm at the end of the day

975
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:14,799
like i'm a

976
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,960
scientific guy i might not look it or

977
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:19,679
sound it but i want to quantify [ __ ] and

978
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:20,800
know what exactly is going on so i did

979
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:22,480
get to see

980
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,800
you know my levels and you know what

981
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:27,918
would deplete and it wasn't

982
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:30,000
incredibly far off from what i kind of

983
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:31,199
already knew like but i had like a

984
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,599
tangible

985
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:35,918
actual number with it now that you know

986
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:37,760
i could i could really hone in with

987
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:39,918
versus me just

988
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:42,480
once again just looking at the plants in

989
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:45,279
the past and being like well every run

990
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:47,440
you know you know on the second you know

991
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:50,480
another run i noticed like i'm starting

992
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:53,200
to peter out here so i need to

993
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:54,878
start adding you know this that or the

994
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:58,399
other right

995
00:34:54,878 --> 00:34:59,920
so yeah if if it's available to you and

996
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:02,400
you can do it

997
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:04,000
i would definitely highly advise that

998
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:06,480
because you know we want to we want to

999
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,320
be the best at you know what we're what

1000
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:10,960
we're trying to do

1001
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:12,960
as far as my soil pots

1002
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:14,240
like beds are really cool

1003
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,960
but the only

1004
00:35:14,239 --> 00:35:20,559
i guess downside of it to me was if

1005
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:22,960
something happens yes

1006
00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:25,759
yeah i don't want it

1007
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:29,599
so if for whatever ungodly reason say

1008
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:31,119
pythium were to uh come into the mix

1009
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:32,800
i don't want that spreading across the

1010
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:35,519
whole bed and losing everything if i

1011
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:37,280
didn't happen to notice it in a plant

1012
00:35:35,519 --> 00:35:39,759
you know i could at least take that pot

1013
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:41,599
and remove it out of the out of the area

1014
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:44,079
and you know be done with it without

1015
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:45,200
break when that and

1016
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:47,280
offered me a little bit of

1017
00:35:45,199 --> 00:35:49,279
configurability where i could you know

1018
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:51,760
arrange things and move around

1019
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:54,400
so but i mean beds are

1020
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:56,320
they are cool you know but it's just uh

1021
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:58,960
for me i needed to

1022
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:01,599
have that little versatility as well

1023
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:04,559
as far as my pots once once i set them

1024
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:06,320
up i don't i never bust them up again

1025
00:36:04,559 --> 00:36:08,239
but i found out like gross stones ain't

1026
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:09,838
around anymore so

1027
00:36:08,239 --> 00:36:11,439
i'm gonna have to go back to like

1028
00:36:09,838 --> 00:36:14,159
comments and [ __ ] like that i guess

1029
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:16,000
again but paralyte breaks down mad quick

1030
00:36:14,159 --> 00:36:17,920
though so

1031
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,079
the important part

1032
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:22,159
about people that i noticed like when

1033
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:24,880
they were doing these like big big huge

1034
00:36:22,159 --> 00:36:27,358
20-something gallon no-till pots

1035
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:29,280
and we're beds for that matter is that

1036
00:36:27,358 --> 00:36:31,440
aeration wise they were just relying a

1037
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:33,519
lot on the paralyte and it's going to

1038
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:34,559
break down fairly quickly yes and then

1039
00:36:33,519 --> 00:36:36,960
you're going to start losing your

1040
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:39,279
aeration which is going to invite you

1041
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:42,240
know problems and

1042
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:44,079
the plants are going to start to suffer

1043
00:36:42,239 --> 00:36:46,639
make sure like when you set your pot or

1044
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:48,800
your bed up make sure that it is you

1045
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:50,559
know it's set up good to go for it for

1046
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:53,200
the long haul

1047
00:36:50,559 --> 00:36:55,119
sizing wise on my pots

1048
00:36:53,199 --> 00:36:57,679
it just i kind of just kind of honed it

1049
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:58,800
in over trial and error for a long time

1050
00:36:57,679 --> 00:37:00,960
as

1051
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:03,200
the plant that i want about the

1052
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,079
we'll just say diameter times height

1053
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:06,239
there

1054
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:09,220
equal pot

1055
00:37:06,239 --> 00:37:10,959
once again plant plant happy plant good

1056
00:37:09,219 --> 00:37:11,919
[Laughter]

1057
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:14,240
so

1058
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:16,400
if it was like a small say like a waist

1059
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:18,959
high belly button plant

1060
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:22,720
five gallons seven gallons full

1061
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:24,800
chest high chin hives you know

1062
00:37:22,719 --> 00:37:28,319
maybe a little taller you know

1063
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:30,560
10 gal on the 15s depending on because

1064
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:33,519
some things have the crazy insane root

1065
00:37:30,559 --> 00:37:35,358
systems that just want to right go go

1066
00:37:33,519 --> 00:37:38,000
bonkers you know and other things they

1067
00:37:35,358 --> 00:37:39,920
don't they don't quite have that that

1068
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,519
vigor in the root zone that like some

1069
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:43,760
cultivars do

1070
00:37:41,519 --> 00:37:46,159
so you know i'd play it play it by ear

1071
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:48,240
with the with the cultivar as well kind

1072
00:37:46,159 --> 00:37:50,000
of try to cater individually instead of

1073
00:37:48,239 --> 00:37:52,000
like all right you're all cannabis right

1074
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,559
all right cool you know y'all all act

1075
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:57,280
the same right and it's like no no no it

1076
00:37:54,559 --> 00:37:58,960
doesn't work not that one not that yeah

1077
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:00,720
in the corner

1078
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:03,119
you know they all got their dietary

1079
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:05,759
needs and

1080
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:07,680
tweaks and [ __ ] and things i do like

1081
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:09,280
don't like

1082
00:38:07,679 --> 00:38:11,598
so let me ask you another question

1083
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:13,839
something we've been talking about in my

1084
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:15,200
discord server with my patrons

1085
00:38:13,838 --> 00:38:17,519
was

1086
00:38:15,199 --> 00:38:19,759
keeping a no-till

1087
00:38:17,519 --> 00:38:21,838
in a certain size i had always heard

1088
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:24,480
don't do it in anything under a 15

1089
00:38:21,838 --> 00:38:26,078
gallon a big reason of that is that dry

1090
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:28,800
down time right and keeping that

1091
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:30,720
biodiversity going exactly

1092
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:33,039
what would you suggest for like the

1093
00:38:30,719 --> 00:38:35,679
smallest pot size that you could get a

1094
00:38:33,039 --> 00:38:37,519
no-till system in with

1095
00:38:35,679 --> 00:38:39,838
i think what it really

1096
00:38:37,519 --> 00:38:41,440
boils down to is the

1097
00:38:39,838 --> 00:38:43,119
one the person

1098
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:45,920
and how attentive and how much you're

1099
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:48,240
there you know in your in your garden

1100
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:50,159
and then the second thing being like

1101
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:51,358
when we go back to the to the plant

1102
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:53,519
itself

1103
00:38:51,358 --> 00:38:55,199
and that root zone bigger

1104
00:38:53,519 --> 00:38:57,199
because like if i got something i know

1105
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:58,799
that just has this crazy root zone and i

1106
00:38:57,199 --> 00:39:00,399
already know that

1107
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:02,400
in a week

1108
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:04,800
four flowers it's starting to suck water

1109
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:07,280
up so damn quick i know better than to

1110
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:09,839
try to grow this big bastard on a 10 or

1111
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:12,160
seven so i know like hey you definitely

1112
00:39:09,838 --> 00:39:15,039
need to be in a 15. some things you can

1113
00:39:12,159 --> 00:39:17,039
get away with with a with a tent

1114
00:39:15,039 --> 00:39:17,838
but yeah that's that's the whole key is

1115
00:39:17,039 --> 00:39:19,599
like

1116
00:39:17,838 --> 00:39:21,119
keeping these microbes happy letting

1117
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:23,680
them build their infrastructure their

1118
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:25,440
highways and byways their living living

1119
00:39:23,679 --> 00:39:27,759
spaces and all in places where they're

1120
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:30,639
reproducing you got

1121
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:33,680
concentrate on them because they're like

1122
00:39:30,639 --> 00:39:36,159
in your industrial assembly line plant

1123
00:39:33,679 --> 00:39:38,639
that's job is to send food to to the

1124
00:39:36,159 --> 00:39:40,480
roots they're your workers and you gotta

1125
00:39:38,639 --> 00:39:41,920
keep your workers happy

1126
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:43,679
the better they do the better that

1127
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:46,159
plant's going to do long as you make

1128
00:39:43,679 --> 00:39:48,719
sure they're happy in their environment

1129
00:39:46,159 --> 00:39:50,239
and they have what they need to succeed

1130
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:53,039
then they're they're they're going to

1131
00:39:50,239 --> 00:39:54,639
take care of the rest for you so i don't

1132
00:39:53,039 --> 00:39:55,440
yeah i think

1133
00:39:54,639 --> 00:39:56,960
with

1134
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,559
most people

1135
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:00,240
definitely like i mean if you want to

1136
00:39:58,559 --> 00:40:02,400
push the envelope and go back and forth

1137
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:05,679
sure but yeah i think you know 15 would

1138
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:08,000
be a good proper size for most people

1139
00:40:05,679 --> 00:40:10,799
they might not be able to you know they

1140
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,559
might work two jobs or you know

1141
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:15,440
you know life gets [ __ ] up sometimes

1142
00:40:12,559 --> 00:40:17,358
so i think 15 would be a good place

1143
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:19,679
caveat to that

1144
00:40:17,358 --> 00:40:22,639
people with big 15s they start [ __ ]

1145
00:40:19,679 --> 00:40:24,399
watering like just transplanted you know

1146
00:40:22,639 --> 00:40:25,920
like you water it down you get it good

1147
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:28,400
and good and down

1148
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:31,519
you you put in a dixie cup

1149
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:33,440
clone you know in it you watered it in

1150
00:40:31,519 --> 00:40:35,119
but everybody wants to water the whole

1151
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:36,838
[ __ ] pot again it doesn't like

1152
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:38,960
throwing the kids in the pool

1153
00:40:36,838 --> 00:40:41,679
yeah so it's like you know it's just

1154
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:44,639
dried out or not dried out but it's

1155
00:40:41,679 --> 00:40:46,559
starting to dry in the immediate area of

1156
00:40:44,639 --> 00:40:48,719
the transplant so the rest of the pot

1157
00:40:46,559 --> 00:40:51,440
was good you just needed to wet out the

1158
00:40:48,719 --> 00:40:53,039
circumference of that area again and

1159
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:55,679
maintain

1160
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:57,679
a good moisture moisture level

1161
00:40:55,679 --> 00:41:00,239
as it's starting to go along because as

1162
00:40:57,679 --> 00:41:01,679
it comes more to a dry not dry but you

1163
00:41:00,239 --> 00:41:03,838
know it's it's

1164
00:41:01,679 --> 00:41:05,519
running out of these this moisture

1165
00:41:03,838 --> 00:41:06,799
that's what roots do it's the horse and

1166
00:41:05,519 --> 00:41:08,800
the carrot thing

1167
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:10,240
it has to kind of go there or else the

1168
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:12,480
root's going to get complacent it'll

1169
00:41:10,239 --> 00:41:13,358
just stay right there and not search for

1170
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:15,440
water

1171
00:41:13,358 --> 00:41:17,679
so like it needs to come you know down

1172
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:19,838
in level 4 to search for it again then

1173
00:41:17,679 --> 00:41:21,199
you need to reward it with some carrot

1174
00:41:19,838 --> 00:41:22,799
and then you know you do it again that's

1175
00:41:21,199 --> 00:41:25,519
what's causing that root system to go

1176
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:26,560
it's looking for moisture and being fed

1177
00:41:25,519 --> 00:41:27,838
that's

1178
00:41:26,559 --> 00:41:29,119
how she goes

1179
00:41:27,838 --> 00:41:31,519
so

1180
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:33,519
if it takes a gallon of water say to wet

1181
00:41:31,519 --> 00:41:35,358
down the spot real good and you

1182
00:41:33,519 --> 00:41:37,199
transplant in and it's good and happy

1183
00:41:35,358 --> 00:41:40,799
when you water again you don't need to

1184
00:41:37,199 --> 00:41:42,719
hit it with another gallon you know

1185
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:45,760
you're probably good with you know 40

1186
00:41:42,719 --> 00:41:47,519
ounces of water or something like that

1187
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:49,280
so that's another one that i noticed

1188
00:41:47,519 --> 00:41:51,358
because then they're just like oh yeah

1189
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:53,040
the root zone didn't do [ __ ] and

1190
00:41:51,358 --> 00:41:56,000
this is never happy is this always

1191
00:41:53,039 --> 00:41:58,318
droopy all the time and yeah

1192
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,318
you've been you're waterboarding them it

1193
00:41:58,318 --> 00:42:03,039
didn't have good government secrets bro

1194
00:42:00,318 --> 00:42:03,920
you waterboarded it for nothing man

1195
00:42:03,039 --> 00:42:07,199
yep

1196
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:10,000
absolutely so i need to smoke a bowl

1197
00:42:07,199 --> 00:42:13,679
really quick but before we get going to

1198
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:15,358
break i wanted to ask you has there been

1199
00:42:13,679 --> 00:42:17,118
one input

1200
00:42:15,358 --> 00:42:19,199
one tip one

1201
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:21,680
major piece of advice that has really

1202
00:42:19,199 --> 00:42:24,078
changed your growth for the better

1203
00:42:21,679 --> 00:42:24,960
hmm it's been

1204
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:26,640
so

1205
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:30,880
many

1206
00:42:26,639 --> 00:42:32,400
so many little things that really did it

1207
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:33,838
one thing

1208
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:36,079
and i don't think i could even put it

1209
00:42:33,838 --> 00:42:37,519
down to just this this one thing man

1210
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:39,760
it's uh

1211
00:42:37,519 --> 00:42:41,599
and so so many things but hey i guess

1212
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:43,760
that means that we got uh

1213
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:46,480
we got more to talk about you know

1214
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:48,880
nothing bored more

1215
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:51,280
yeah absolutely all those little things

1216
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:53,119
that you reach for that people give you

1217
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:55,200
advice over you try them they work for

1218
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:57,039
you all that stuff adds up to what your

1219
00:42:55,199 --> 00:42:58,399
style of growing is right

1220
00:42:57,039 --> 00:43:00,960
yeah exactly

1221
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:03,039
for me i think the biggest thing

1222
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:03,920
you know it's not one thing

1223
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:05,358
it's

1224
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:07,599
the idea

1225
00:43:05,358 --> 00:43:10,799
that i don't have to throw my soil away

1226
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:13,359
anymore i can regenerate this i can

1227
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:15,599
not only help my plants i can help my

1228
00:43:13,358 --> 00:43:17,279
pocket i can help the planet all at the

1229
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:19,280
same time

1230
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:21,599
you know what i could ride without being

1231
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:23,359
one of those things because

1232
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:25,760
you know way back in the day i used to

1233
00:43:23,358 --> 00:43:26,960
toss mine out he said his root balls i

1234
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:28,880
throw them in the garden where i was

1235
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:31,280
growing you know watermelons tomatoes

1236
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:33,519
and [ __ ] yep and i had like that one

1237
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:35,440
section where [ __ ] was just bonkers feel

1238
00:43:33,519 --> 00:43:36,719
like my hand us that's some real good

1239
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:38,159
soil down there everything must be

1240
00:43:36,719 --> 00:43:39,598
washing off going down there to the

1241
00:43:38,159 --> 00:43:42,318
bottom bro

1242
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:44,079
yeah man i reckon so i reckon so well

1243
00:43:42,318 --> 00:43:46,400
yeah you throw that [ __ ] in the trash

1244
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:47,839
then you know you got the you got the

1245
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:49,440
chance of them seeing that [ __ ] unless

1246
00:43:47,838 --> 00:43:50,960
you throw it in like a [ __ ] abandoned

1247
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:55,838
dumpster somewhere

1248
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:58,000
but uh yeah man yeah in the country

1249
00:43:55,838 --> 00:43:59,358
i was talking to gas from swami organic

1250
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,358
seed and that's one of the things that

1251
00:43:59,358 --> 00:44:03,838
he was talking about too he used to

1252
00:44:01,358 --> 00:44:05,598
throw his soil away back in the day and

1253
00:44:03,838 --> 00:44:06,960
one of the things that we both know is

1254
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:09,119
because that's a place where you can

1255
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:11,519
throw soil where nobody's gonna question

1256
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:14,240
why is there soil there right

1257
00:44:11,519 --> 00:44:15,759
but and you know what the one time where

1258
00:44:14,239 --> 00:44:16,959
i just said

1259
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:19,680
[ __ ] it

1260
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:21,920
let's just roll again just for shits and

1261
00:44:19,679 --> 00:44:24,000
giggles just to see what's going on here

1262
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:25,920
yep it was better

1263
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,000
it was better than the first run yep and

1264
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:29,760
that's what triggered it in my head

1265
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,599
that's what we were saying we're

1266
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:33,520
throwing that through that soil in our

1267
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:35,680
gardens and all of a sudden we noticed

1268
00:44:33,519 --> 00:44:37,358
our [ __ ] tomatoes are happy our

1269
00:44:35,679 --> 00:44:40,399

1270
00:44:37,358 --> 00:44:41,358
on here like this isn't trash made of

00:46:43,519 --> 00:46:48,639
questions okay take your time take your

1326
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:50,800
time it really is

1327
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:53,199
i'm gonna say screaming eagle in there

1328
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:54,960
too oh [ __ ] and with that dominion v

1329
00:46:53,199 --> 00:46:57,519
it's like my pole cat dominion g

1330
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:59,760
projects you know like those were

1331
00:46:57,519 --> 00:47:02,000
oh man these are good ones

1332
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:02,880
you know so but yeah that would probably

1333
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,960
be it

1334
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:06,160
the the screaming eagle one was a was a

1335
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:08,318
big one too

1336
00:47:06,159 --> 00:47:11,199
what was the difference between the

1337
00:47:08,318 --> 00:47:13,679
dominion g and the capital g

1338
00:47:11,199 --> 00:47:15,199
well the the cat g was just the the

1339
00:47:13,679 --> 00:47:17,519
first

1340
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:19,358
the first attempt you know like like i'm

1341
00:47:17,519 --> 00:47:21,119
gonna make this and we're we're gonna

1342
00:47:19,358 --> 00:47:24,799
see what happens

1343
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:26,800
a lot a lot of nasty nasty funk

1344
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:29,119
resulted from it

1345
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:30,640
i grew some out

1346
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:32,400
for just a

1347
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:34,799
just to hook up some friends with it you

1348
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:36,838
know i had a little keeper you know that

1349
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:40,720
that i wanted to you know keep working

1350
00:47:36,838 --> 00:47:43,119
with it was just [ __ ] skunk man

1351
00:47:40,719 --> 00:47:45,519
and people were flipping out about it

1352
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:47,599
so i only had

1353
00:47:45,519 --> 00:47:50,159
because i did a huge hunt

1354
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:52,400
jesus christ i think it was like 40

1355
00:47:50,159 --> 00:47:55,279
packs something like that and people

1356
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:56,960
were just [ __ ] trying to [ __ ]

1357
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:58,559
just i thought it was going to get raped

1358
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:00,000
or something the way people were [ __ ]

1359
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:02,240
creeping on me

1360
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:04,159
so i was like [ __ ] it oh yeah just take

1361
00:48:02,239 --> 00:48:06,558
them you know it's like it's not a done

1362
00:48:04,159 --> 00:48:08,399
deal but i've already had my selection

1363
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:10,800
i've already made a step you know in the

1364
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:12,800
process so i already know like

1365
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:14,720
even if they tried some some [ __ ] boy

1366
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:17,039
[ __ ] which i know is gonna happen anyway

1367
00:48:14,719 --> 00:48:19,199
because i've been doing this a while um

1368
00:48:17,039 --> 00:48:21,440
there's no way in how they'd catch up

1369
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:22,318
so you know i left that out but you know

1370
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:25,200
the

1371
00:48:22,318 --> 00:48:26,639
ultimate goal was to you know refine it

1372
00:48:25,199 --> 00:48:29,199
further and further

1373
00:48:26,639 --> 00:48:31,039
further along into uh

1374
00:48:29,199 --> 00:48:33,679
the the dominion g

1375
00:48:31,039 --> 00:48:35,279
and having like a really just

1376
00:48:33,679 --> 00:48:37,838
same thing with the

1377
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:39,440
the pole cat you know having that nasty

1378
00:48:37,838 --> 00:48:42,558
that kim skunk

1379
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:43,920
blend on the on the nose and just knock

1380
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:46,160
down

1381
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:47,838
kick-ass potency and just good

1382
00:48:46,159 --> 00:48:50,159
well-structured plants that weren't

1383
00:48:47,838 --> 00:48:51,519
floppy or anything you know and stuff

1384
00:48:50,159 --> 00:48:53,920
that was good and hearty that you know

1385
00:48:51,519 --> 00:48:56,079
you could grow it indoor or outdoor

1386
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:58,800
and not finicky so

1387
00:48:56,079 --> 00:49:00,880
in the hills and the cold

1388
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:02,079
yeah they can they can take it they can

1389
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:03,838
definitely

1390
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:05,119
that was my favorite was growing it up

1391
00:49:03,838 --> 00:49:07,279
in the mountains when it was all cold

1392
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:10,480
and [ __ ] it would just get thick man

1393
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:13,280
those branches would be like arms yeah

1394
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:15,760
by far one of my favorite another big

1395
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:17,280
thing about something you

1396
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:18,960
talked about was

1397
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:21,280
when you're curing

1398
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:23,760
you leave about like one or two inches

1399
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:25,760
on your petioles right yeah man dude

1400
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:28,480
that's been a huge thing for me that has

1401
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:30,800
helped me out so much with my grill

1402
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:33,440
yeah it really it really helps with that

1403
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:35,920
with the drying process man like

1404
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:37,838
it keeps things more consistent you know

1405
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:41,039
so you're not drying up in one spot not

1406
00:49:37,838 --> 00:49:43,119
the other nice consistent drying and it

1407
00:49:41,039 --> 00:49:45,759
acts as like like kind of acts as like a

1408
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:48,160
wick almost you know just kind of slowly

1409
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:50,480
and surely just evenly

1410
00:49:48,159 --> 00:49:52,239
displacing that that moisture that we're

1411
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:54,079
trying to get rid of you know

1412
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:55,439
yeah dude turn me on to that back in the

1413
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:57,359
day and

1414
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:59,760
i was like yeah [ __ ] it you know he

1415
00:49:57,358 --> 00:50:01,920
found out by accident too yeah it was

1416
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:03,920
you know some remembers this little lady

1417
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:05,838
or his daughter or what but

1418
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:07,680
just helping him do it and this wasn't

1419
00:50:05,838 --> 00:50:09,599
yeah using scissors it was a snip snip

1420
00:50:07,679 --> 00:50:11,199
snip so if something left it and he was

1421
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:13,119
like oh no you can just break them off

1422
00:50:11,199 --> 00:50:14,558
and just leave it you know by the branch

1423
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:16,240
like whatever

1424
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:18,319
and then he had all the ones that they

1425
00:50:16,239 --> 00:50:20,639
you know had done like that they noticed

1426
00:50:18,318 --> 00:50:22,800
like wow that that made a

1427
00:50:20,639 --> 00:50:24,879
substantial difference there so then he

1428
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:27,440
started doing it on purpose and turned

1429
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:29,280
me onto it and say i'll be down

1430
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:31,599
nice dude hell yeah

1431
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:33,519
see before that i was doing a whole

1432
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:35,920
plant hang i would leave on all the fan

1433
00:50:33,519 --> 00:50:38,079
leaves and everything like that and it

1434
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:39,920
really i mean it was okay if you had a

1435
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:42,079
couple of plants in there with really

1436
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:43,760
good air flow but uh yeah you got that

1437
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:45,519
thing packed after like an outdoor

1438
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:47,680
harvest or something it's like jesus

1439
00:50:45,519 --> 00:50:50,318
christ there's so much moisture in here

1440
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:52,399
and i would take them all the way down

1441
00:50:50,318 --> 00:50:54,159
you know cut the entire leaf off petiole

1442
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:55,680
and everything and then when i heard you

1443
00:50:54,159 --> 00:50:57,598
say that i started leaving a little

1444
00:50:55,679 --> 00:50:59,279
extra on there and it actually helped

1445
00:50:57,599 --> 00:51:00,240
out quite a bit

1446
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:01,680
yeah

1447
00:51:00,239 --> 00:51:03,759
yeah like i said it's those little

1448
00:51:01,679 --> 00:51:05,358
things that we pick up and

1449
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:07,119
we start adding all those little things

1450
00:51:05,358 --> 00:51:08,799
together and make a real successful

1451
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:09,838
regimen there you know

1452
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:12,000
yep

1453
00:51:09,838 --> 00:51:14,880

wasn't even like a mole even you know it

1477
00:52:04,318 --> 00:52:07,358
was just

1478
00:52:05,199 --> 00:52:08,879
like a giant freckle

1479
00:52:07,358 --> 00:52:11,199
birthmark

1480
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:15,440

later and she's you know she's like a um

1484
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:23,599
a nurse or whatever and it's like yeah

1485

00:55:53,119 --> 00:55:58,960
i don't know man

1590
00:55:55,119 --> 00:56:00,720

1591
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:02,480
i like the [ __ ] names that you come

1592
00:56:00,719 --> 00:56:04,959
out with man it's all good

1593
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:07,039
polecat was a big one to me because

1594
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:08,240
when i had my cousins moved over to

1595
00:56:07,039 --> 00:56:10,960
montana

1596
00:56:08,239 --> 00:56:13,118
they lived on pole cat road

1597
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:14,960
and so that name stuck out to me i was

1598
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:17,280
like [ __ ] polka we gotta grow pool

1599
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:19,440
cat man like

1600
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:21,280
that's pretty dope but when you had that

1601
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:23,440
one i remember seeing the cross on it

1602
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:25,599
said basic skunk and i said

1603
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:27,679
that's such a funny

1604
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:30,000
way to name something when we were

1605
00:56:27,679 --> 00:56:32,558
talking earlier about like the old

1606
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,440
tactics of oh you can't have that one

1607
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:36,000
like

1608
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:38,000
right but who wants basic skunk like

1609
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:40,639
that sounds like it's [ __ ]

1610
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:42,480
it's basic man

1611
00:56:40,639 --> 00:56:44,558
what was the basic skunk and why did you

1612
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:47,440
name it that

1613
00:56:44,559 --> 00:56:50,400
it was a it's the nl skunk and l skunk

1614
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:52,240
type hybrid and back in the day

1615
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:53,838
they had the um

1616
00:56:52,239 --> 00:56:57,439
the basic five

1617
00:56:53,838 --> 00:56:58,960
uh through sativa c12 skunk hybrid which

1618
00:56:57,440 --> 00:57:00,559
is nl5

1619
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:03,440
that's what they they i guess that's

1620
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:07,280
what they decided to call it then

1621
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:11,280
oh so this was a ssc original yeah that

1622
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:15,359
was their old name okay uh for nl5

1623
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:18,400
well that makes more sense now okay

1624
00:57:15,358 --> 00:57:21,358
yeah exactly so yeah using

1625
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:23,440
the like an old scentsy uh shiva skunk

1626
00:57:21,358 --> 00:57:25,759
and basic skunk and

1627
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:27,519
making this hybrid it wasn't you know

1628
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:29,200
the basic five

1629
00:57:27,519 --> 00:57:31,119
skunk hybrids so it was just like i

1630
00:57:29,199 --> 00:57:33,759
would just call it you know basic skunk

1631
00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:34,960
and it's cool because the name like that

1632
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:36,000
it was something you know we were

1633
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:37,920
keeping

1634
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:40,159
you know keeping in-house and everything

1635
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:42,318
but still this the name of line is like

1636
00:57:40,159 --> 00:57:45,759
oh guys this is basics

1637
00:57:42,318 --> 00:57:45,759
i need to look over here guy

1638
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:50,798
right nice yeah yeah that would that was

1639
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:52,160
a little bit beyond my time so it's nice

1640
00:57:50,798 --> 00:57:54,400
hearing those stories and getting

1641
00:57:52,159 --> 00:57:55,598
familiarized with where those genetics

1642
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:57,838
came from

1643
00:57:55,599 --> 00:57:58,798
is that the same thing with the cis

1644
00:57:57,838 --> 00:58:01,119
skunk

1645
00:57:58,798 --> 00:58:03,759
or was that your creation no that was

1646
00:58:01,119 --> 00:58:07,039
that was that was one of mine yeah

1647
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:09,680
okay so you did do the cis the granny

1648
00:58:07,039 --> 00:58:11,920
and the local one was just one that was

1649
00:58:09,679 --> 00:58:14,558
running around virginia

1650
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:16,318
yeah that was another one that we um

1651
00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:17,359
that we were just goofing around back in

1652
00:58:16,318 --> 00:58:18,719
the day

1653
00:58:17,358 --> 00:58:21,358
and um

1654
00:58:18,719 --> 00:58:23,519
using a sour diesel ibl when we were

1655
00:58:21,358 --> 00:58:25,279
goofing around with that

1656
00:58:23,519 --> 00:58:27,519
which that

1657
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:29,280
wanted to pass out some testers to a few

1658
00:58:27,519 --> 00:58:31,039
people we knew some people that already

1659
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:33,680
were already growing sour

1660
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:34,880
and uh he wanted our feedback on it you

1661
00:58:33,679 --> 00:58:36,399
know because we could give a real

1662
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:38,000
feedback in comparison to the client

1663
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:39,280
because back then

1664
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:41,920
you didn't have a whole [ __ ] ton of

1665
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:43,839
people growing sour diesel you know you

1666
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:45,519
didn't have even that many people ever

1667
00:58:43,838 --> 00:58:47,358
even smoked it so

1668
00:58:45,519 --> 00:58:49,920
you needed the good feedback

1669
00:58:47,358 --> 00:58:52,798
and um they're just goofing around had

1670

01:01:30,079 --> 01:01:36,798
from there and then hit the airborne g13

1736
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:39,119

virginia beach ganny that's just the

1741
01:01:46,159 --> 01:01:50,879
as it's the girl this one we went uh

1742
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:53,119
with the mail route down the mail

1743
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:55,920

1744
01:01:53,119 --> 01:01:57,200
girls saw what i wanted to see

1745
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:58,880
found the mail that was best

1746
01:01:57,199 --> 01:02:01,199
corresponding to that

1747
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:04,240
and hit the airborne with it so that way

1748
01:02:01,199 --> 01:02:06,960
we got a good good amount of uh d13

1749
01:02:04,239 --> 01:02:08,879
genetics in there plus there's some nl2

1750
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:10,720
because half of that airborne is it's a

1751
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:13,760
g13 nl2

1752
01:02:10,719 --> 01:02:14,959
from old neville seed bank stock if you

1753
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:16,960
grew him out

1754
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:18,559
you know his little handle was airborne

1755
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:21,199
so um

1756
01:02:18,559 --> 01:02:24,000
you know that was his keeper so

1757
01:02:21,199 --> 01:02:26,879
you know between the uh afghani and the

1758
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:29,199
88 hash plant the rg13 hash plant we

1759
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:31,200
were kind of getting

1760
01:02:29,199 --> 01:02:33,598
good symmetry you know good the things

1761
01:02:31,199 --> 01:02:35,519
are syncing up just just right

1762
01:02:33,599 --> 01:02:36,798
so it ended up

1763
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:38,798
[ __ ] awesome

1764
01:02:36,798 --> 01:02:40,880
i really really love that one

1765
01:02:38,798 --> 01:02:42,798
it's a great one i'm gonna continue to

1766
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:43,838
work with that one too man

1767
01:02:42,798 --> 01:02:45,920
so

1768
01:02:43,838 --> 01:02:48,159
philly you know well you answered one of

1769
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:49,440
the next question

1770
01:02:48,159 --> 01:02:50,960
yeah yeah

1771
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:52,480
i need a

1772
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:53,679
an affiliate

1773
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:54,880
read that one

1774
01:02:53,679 --> 01:02:57,038
and uh

1775
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:58,640
come back at everybody with it

1776
01:02:57,039 --> 01:03:01,280
that way i can hone in on that one

1777
01:02:58,639 --> 01:03:02,960
phenotype that i feel is just

1778
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:05,200
just so awesome like all of them are

1779
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:07,119
great but there's the one pino that like

1780
01:03:05,199 --> 01:03:08,960
i mean it pops up frequently but like i

1781
01:03:07,119 --> 01:03:11,200
want i want the majority of the pack

1782
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:12,798
popping something like that and since

1783
01:03:11,199 --> 01:03:15,199
there was only a limited amount of them

1784
01:03:12,798 --> 01:03:17,199
that went out to begin with anyway

1785
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:19,439
so like general public because most of

1786
01:03:17,199 --> 01:03:21,838
them i gave out to veterans

1787
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:25,039
for them to grow or people that were

1788
01:03:21,838 --> 01:03:27,759
grown for vets or ptsd and stuff and bad

1789
01:03:25,039 --> 01:03:30,480
anxiety problems okay yup that's why i

1790
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:32,559
remember so i gave most of them

1791
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:34,798
and then i had a handful left that sold

1792
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:37,359
uh sold off because you know a lot of

1793
01:03:34,798 --> 01:03:38,480
people like well i mean just need that

1794
01:03:37,358 --> 01:03:41,119
just people

1795
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:42,798
beating your door down you know so

1796
01:03:41,119 --> 01:03:44,240
everybody had basically hit me up that

1797
01:03:42,798 --> 01:03:45,280
was going to hit me up it was like a

1798
01:03:44,239 --> 01:03:47,519
whole

1799
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:49,680
[ __ ] year maybe even more than a year

1800
01:03:47,519 --> 01:03:51,920
later i was like all right let the last

1801
01:03:49,679 --> 01:03:53,838
handful of them out people went

1802
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:55,838
pretty much ape [ __ ] over it

1803
01:03:53,838 --> 01:03:57,838
and um i was like yeah you know it's

1804
01:03:55,838 --> 01:03:59,599
something i need to continue on because

1805
01:03:57,838 --> 01:04:02,719
i was so impressed with it

1806
01:03:59,599 --> 01:04:04,798
it's such a good good thing so

1807
01:04:02,719 --> 01:04:07,838
so would it be fair to say that you have

1808
01:04:04,798 --> 01:04:10,798
plans to get back into those find that

1809
01:04:07,838 --> 01:04:13,920
phenotype and back cross it

1810
01:04:10,798 --> 01:04:16,480
so i had already done um some

1811
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:19,039
affiliate stuff with it anyway

1812
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:20,240
and or two steps with it

1813
01:04:19,039 --> 01:04:23,119
and

1814
01:04:20,239 --> 01:04:25,038
it really honed in it really really came

1815
01:04:23,119 --> 01:04:28,000
down just just doing it like that so i

1816
01:04:25,039 --> 01:04:30,319
don't think um back crossing will be uh

1817
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:32,480
will be necessary with that one so

1818
01:04:30,318 --> 01:04:33,599
you're going to go forward with the line

1819
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:35,599
right on

1820
01:04:33,599 --> 01:04:37,359
yeah just doing doing the failure i

1821
01:04:35,599 --> 01:04:38,720
think uh you know

1822
01:04:37,358 --> 01:04:40,798
just

1823
01:04:38,719 --> 01:04:42,239
you know we'll do the f4

1824
01:04:40,798 --> 01:04:44,400
and then you know check it out from

1825
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:46,479
there and that's probably where i'll

1826
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:49,599
i'll leave it as just set up just set an

1827
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:51,599
f4 i'll keep keep driving it in and then

1828
01:04:49,599 --> 01:04:53,920
and then i'm getting that result of that

1829
01:04:51,599 --> 01:04:56,160
for them you know i'm cool with that

1830
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:58,400
hell yeah so everybody's got something

1831
01:04:56,159 --> 01:04:59,598
to look forward to eventually in the

1832
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:01,920
future

1833
01:04:59,599 --> 01:05:04,079
oh yeah oh yeah

1834
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:05,519
when you can

1835
01:05:04,079 --> 01:05:07,039
when they're where there's a little

1836
01:05:05,519 --> 01:05:09,358
there's a lie right

1837
01:05:07,039 --> 01:05:10,319
when you're a free man again that's

1838
01:05:09,358 --> 01:05:13,598
right

1839
01:05:10,318 --> 01:05:15,920

1840
01:05:13,599 --> 01:05:17,680

i knew like i wanted to do some good

1888
01:07:07,039 --> 01:07:11,839
things for people but i had

1889
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:16,079
no idea that there would be

1890
01:07:11,838 --> 01:07:17,920
by the time i got out in the legit world

1891
01:07:16,079 --> 01:07:21,039
i just saw so much

1892
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:23,680
[ __ ] and [ __ ] and

1893
01:07:21,039 --> 01:07:25,520
you know people that were not

1894
01:07:23,679 --> 01:07:28,239
not the best people in the past and i'm

1895
01:07:25,519 --> 01:07:30,318
like wow holy [ __ ] y'all are all of the

1896
01:07:28,239 --> 01:07:32,000
people running this now like

1897
01:07:30,318 --> 01:07:33,920
and honestly like it pissed me off

1898
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:36,000
before i even moved out here

1899
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:38,240
and i was like all right well you know

1900
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:39,838
i'm still gonna go do my thing

1901
01:07:38,239 --> 01:07:42,078
and i think

1902
01:07:39,838 --> 01:07:44,239
you know i never expected it but one

1903
01:07:42,079 --> 01:07:46,640
thing i can say to anybody is like

1904
01:07:44,239 --> 01:07:49,759
you're just doing what you do

1905
01:07:46,639 --> 01:07:51,358
doing the right thing every day

1906
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:54,480
if it's the right thing and the good

1907
01:07:51,358 --> 01:07:57,199
energy a good intention

1908
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:58,798
people that have that that same

1909
01:07:57,199 --> 01:08:02,000
basis you know in their life you know

1910
01:07:58,798 --> 01:08:03,280
ethics and and quality and and and just

1911
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:05,358
you know the whole

1912
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:06,400
the whole can of worms man like

1913
01:08:05,358 --> 01:08:08,318
those people are going to find

1914
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:09,440
themselves drawn to you

1915
01:08:08,318 --> 01:08:11,199
and

1916
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:13,200
what's refreshing about the whole thing

1917
01:08:11,199 --> 01:08:14,798
is like there's so many

1918
01:08:13,199 --> 01:08:16,079
really really really good people still

1919
01:08:14,798 --> 01:08:18,319
left out there

1920
01:08:16,079 --> 01:08:19,119
and that gave me uh definitely gave me

1921
01:08:18,319 --> 01:08:20,159

2136
01:16:06,238 --> 01:16:09,439

and just insane amounts of resin and

2139
01:16:12,238 --> 01:16:15,198
really really strong knockdown potency

2140
01:16:14,319 --> 01:16:18,079
but

2141
01:16:15,198 --> 01:16:20,319

2142
01:16:18,079 --> 01:16:23,439
orange uh citrusy

2143
01:16:20,319 --> 01:16:24,479
finos that he was just blowing away with

2157
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:54,640
i mean you work with skunks you work

2158
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:56,159
with g13 you also do so much afghani

2159
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:57,840
work and [ __ ] do you have like a

2160
01:16:56,158 --> 01:16:59,679
preference in the type of high that you

2161
01:16:57,840 --> 01:17:02,480
enjoy i like them all

2162
01:16:59,679 --> 01:17:04,399
oh this depends on the time you're like

2163
01:17:02,479 --> 01:17:06,399
yeah they all have their own place

2164
01:17:04,399 --> 01:17:10,158
exactly is there one that you're like

2165
01:17:06,399 --> 01:17:10,158
wanting more than the other

2166
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:15,600
ah like so

2167
01:17:13,359 --> 01:17:17,119
and this is kind of segue with the you

2168
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:18,000
know we were talking about medical stuff

2169
01:17:17,119 --> 01:17:21,039
too

2170
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:23,760
is like if you smoke that same thing

2171
01:17:21,039 --> 01:17:25,679
every day day in day out yes you build

2172
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:28,400
up that tolerance and it's just not as

2173
01:17:25,679 --> 01:17:30,560
great as it was you know you said like

2174
01:17:28,399 --> 01:17:32,399
chasing the dragon looking forward again

2175
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:35,360
but you just got you got to put it down

2176
01:17:32,399 --> 01:17:37,439
and get away from it so i always like

2177
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:39,519
you know the so for our time and place

2178
01:17:37,439 --> 01:17:41,119
so like my day times

2179
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:42,560
three to five different things i like

2180
01:17:41,119 --> 01:17:44,158
for the daytime

2181
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:46,159
intermediate in the evening i want to

2182
01:17:44,158 --> 01:17:48,319
chill but i still got to do [ __ ]

2183
01:17:46,158 --> 01:17:50,158
you know at three to five i like that

2184
01:17:48,319 --> 01:17:52,000
and three to five for just knocking me

2185
01:17:50,158 --> 01:17:54,319
the [ __ ] out at night yeah so that way i

2186
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:55,840
can rotate through these and the same

2187
01:17:54,319 --> 01:17:58,399
thing with like dealing with medical

2188
01:17:55,840 --> 01:18:00,159
patients is like finding multiple

2189
01:17:58,399 --> 01:18:02,319
things that are getting to that same

2190
01:18:00,158 --> 01:18:04,079
goal for them and leaving them whatever

2191
01:18:02,319 --> 01:18:06,319
element it might be right

2192
01:18:04,079 --> 01:18:08,319
and that way they can rotate it so this

2193
01:18:06,319 --> 01:18:09,679
one day this one the next day and then

2194
01:18:08,319 --> 01:18:11,840
go through that cycle so they don't

2195
01:18:09,679 --> 01:18:13,600
really build that tolerance up to it so

2196
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:14,880
they're getting good relief you know day

2197
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:16,079
in and day out

2198
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:17,920
so

2199
01:18:16,079 --> 01:18:20,479
yeah i had a lot of different little

2200
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:22,399
ones for the day and then in the evening

2201
01:18:20,479 --> 01:18:23,919
and then you know definitely for the for

2202
01:18:22,399 --> 01:18:26,559
the night too

2203
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:29,039
good deal good deal man i'm very much

2204
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:30,560
the same i feel myself going for the

2205
01:18:29,039 --> 01:18:32,640
more heady [ __ ]

2206
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:35,039
most the time and i'm one of those guys

2207
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:37,360
that's like i'm gonna keep going and i'm

2208
01:18:35,039 --> 01:18:39,359
going all day until i pass the [ __ ] out

2209
01:18:37,359 --> 01:18:41,359
there's no relaxing and going to bed i'm

2210
01:18:39,359 --> 01:18:43,279
just like [ __ ]

2211
01:18:41,359 --> 01:18:44,960
when my body gives out i'm done and

2212
01:18:43,279 --> 01:18:46,479
that's when i'm gonna smoke my bedtime

2213
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:49,119
[ __ ] yeah

2214
01:18:46,479 --> 01:18:51,439
so that's pretty rare for me in finding

2215
01:18:49,119 --> 01:18:52,960
a cultivar that i appreciate for that

2216
01:18:51,439 --> 01:18:55,198
time of the day

2217
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:57,520
when i'm just i'm ready to go to bed i'm

2218
01:18:55,198 --> 01:18:59,198
done i want to be relaxed i want to lay

2219
01:18:57,520 --> 01:19:00,880
in my bed float for a second and fall

2220
01:18:59,198 --> 01:19:02,960
asleep yeah

2221
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:04,800
what have you produced that you would be

2222
01:19:02,960 --> 01:19:07,198
like man this is this is what you need

2223
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:09,520
to go out for betty bye

2224
01:19:07,198 --> 01:19:11,119

2225
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:13,679
for the night

2226
01:19:11,119 --> 01:19:15,599
that local skunk was pretty [ __ ]

2227
01:19:13,679 --> 01:19:17,359
knocked down and uh

2228
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:20,079
some of those phenos like it was just

2229
01:19:17,359 --> 01:19:23,359
over you know overboard

2230
01:19:20,079 --> 01:19:26,479
i would also have to say

2231
01:19:23,359 --> 01:19:28,880
these purple dahlia finos were real good

2232
01:19:26,479 --> 01:19:30,079
for me for going to sleep

2233
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:32,960
[ __ ] yes

2234
01:19:30,079 --> 01:19:33,840
i was looking at that one

2235
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:36,480
yeah

2236
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:39,840

2238
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:44,400
this heavy

2239
01:19:41,279 --> 01:19:46,880
put you out type type stone

2240
01:19:44,399 --> 01:19:49,359
grainy skunk that was another one that

2241
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:51,600
was definitely more on the narcotic

2242
01:19:49,359 --> 01:19:53,198
narcotic side

2243
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:55,120
screaming eagle

2244
01:19:53,198 --> 01:19:56,879
i'm like if you're really chief and

2245
01:19:55,119 --> 01:19:58,960

2247
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:03,439
zone too

2248
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:06,400
there was uh the beefcake d which was

2249
01:20:03,439 --> 01:20:07,519
like a figure four uh male to the kim

2250
01:20:06,399 --> 01:20:09,198
dog d

2251
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:11,520
that one was pretty

2252
01:20:09,198 --> 01:20:12,559
pretty heavy on the on the sedation as

2253
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:14,320
well

2254
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:17,440
i don't know why

2255
01:20:14,319 --> 01:20:18,960
but kim and og bring me up

2256
01:20:17,439 --> 01:20:21,359
like a [ __ ]

2257
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:23,520
i was gonna say that too

2258
01:20:21,359 --> 01:20:25,759
i don't get that but a lot of people it

2259
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:28,320
knocks out it brings me the [ __ ] up i

2260
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:31,360
love kim in the morning

2261
01:20:28,319 --> 01:20:33,519
i had a yes i've had friends in the past

2262
01:20:31,359 --> 01:20:35,599
like you ever have any friends like they

2263
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:37,040
put them on ridlon or adderall or

2264
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:38,560
anything like that

2265
01:20:37,039 --> 01:20:42,319
no

2266
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:46,600
no no all right so it's like a 80 [ __ ]

2267
01:20:42,319 --> 01:20:46,599
that would make a lot of sense though

2268
01:20:52,158 --> 01:20:55,599
bounces off the walls all the [ __ ]

2269
01:20:54,158 --> 01:20:57,198
time right

2270
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:58,480
so they give them the [ __ ] and then just

2271
01:20:57,198 --> 01:21:00,638
mellows them out

2272
01:20:58,479 --> 01:21:01,919
you know allows them to concentrate and

2273
01:21:00,639 --> 01:21:04,480
you know do

2274
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:07,520
right be more calm right

2275
01:21:04,479 --> 01:21:09,439
now if you give that same drug to

2276
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:11,920
someone else who doesn't need that

2277
01:21:09,439 --> 01:21:13,759
they're going to [ __ ] bounce all over

2278
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:15,199
the walls and and it's the exact

2279
01:21:13,760 --> 01:21:16,079
opposite right

2280
01:21:15,198 --> 01:21:18,559
right

2281
01:21:16,079 --> 01:21:21,279
so there's some people

2282
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:24,560
that can take like narcotics even

2283
01:21:21,279 --> 01:21:26,079
percocets and oxycontin and shellica and

2284
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:28,080
man they're they're [ __ ] singing

2285
01:21:26,079 --> 01:21:30,639
around the [ __ ] place doing doing

2286
01:21:28,079 --> 01:21:32,639
work and talking a million miles an hour

2287
01:21:30,639 --> 01:21:34,560
and then you know the next man

2288
01:21:32,639 --> 01:21:36,000
you know he's gonna be passed out for

2289
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:37,440
about eight hours

2290
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:40,158
so it's like

2291
01:21:37,439 --> 01:21:41,599
depending on the person you know it

2292
01:21:40,158 --> 01:21:43,279
really had you know you could say like

2293
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:45,840
the majority of people

2294
01:21:43,279 --> 01:21:48,559
experience this but yeah sometimes it's

2295
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:50,480
the exact exact opposite man

2296
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:52,800
and i found that interesting with those

2297
01:21:50,479 --> 01:21:54,079
