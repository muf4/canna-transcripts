53
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:53,599

54
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:56,079

00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,480
the beginning and you know i kind of

59
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,439

growing conversations and then

63
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,360

use his mics and his setup and yeah got

88
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:04,878
the ball rolling

89
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,680
oh yeah man

90
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:07,598
so

91
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,959
how many episodes did you guys get in

92
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:10,399
before you're like

93
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,920
we're gonna do this like we're gonna

94
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,120
invest in some equipment and start doing

95
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:14,958
this ourselves

96
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:18,239
one

97
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:19,439
yeah i think uh after that first episode

98
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:21,039
um

99
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:22,800
pretty much

100
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,120
beyond that like right after that we

101
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:28,800
went and went on amazon bought these

102
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:30,959
mics that are in the shot today and um

103
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,240
bought one audio box and we didn't

104
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:36,159
really know how to use it very well it

105
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:37,759
was like a usb one um upgraded uh or got

106
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,120
another one because josh was out of town

107
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,400
quite a bit and we had to do that from

108
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,079
afar

109
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:43,679
just because of his job but then we got

110
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:44,879
the one that we're using today which is

111
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,918
great it's

112
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:47,600
uh

113
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:50,079
it's like the pod track yeah the pod

114
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,919
track p4 and it's got like four sound

115
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:53,599
bite options for it it's got four

116
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:54,560
channels and it's i don't know it's

117
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,479
really good

118
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,399
so that was our like latest purchase and

119
00:04:56,478 --> 00:05:00,879
we have a camera as well it just

120
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:02,319
doesn't work very good uh so that was

121
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:03,439
kind of a shitty purchase but you know

122
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:05,279
it's all

123
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:08,319
it it's all in the in the learning

124
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:10,638
process but yeah from like episode two i

125
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:12,240
would say we we invested into at least

126
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,280
these mics to get good audio quality

127
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,639
because that was one of the things that

128
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:19,038
like was priority for us um is you know

129
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:20,400
we listen to podcasts and some of them

130
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:23,439
you know just don't have the best

131
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:25,198
quality uh just audio wise and so it's

132
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:26,478
kind of hard to listen to sometimes and

133
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,280
that was one of the things that we were

134
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:31,199
just like dead set no we have to have

135
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:34,159
at least some sort of you know at least

136
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,759
mid-range quality mic yeah and landed on

137
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:39,280
these at night they sound pretty pretty

138
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:40,479
good i think all right yeah

139
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:41,439
hell yeah

140
00:05:40,478 --> 00:05:43,359
so

141
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:45,759
the smoking with podcasts you started

142
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,439
this just your smoke buddies you're

143
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,520
hanging out smoking all the time getting

144
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:51,038
into these deep conversations

145
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:55,519
where did it go from there is that what

146
00:05:51,038 --> 00:05:56,639
it still is is it just smoking uh i mean

147
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:58,240
it

148
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:01,519
as we

149
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:04,560
i guess mature as growers in like

150
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:08,399
cannabis we're both in the industry so

151
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:11,038
it's it's evolved into more of a

152
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:12,959
like a grow talk kind of situation where

153
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:15,519
you know we try to cover some topics or

154
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:16,399
some news that's related to the industry

155
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:19,038
or

156
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:21,359
you know some tidbits information we got

157
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:23,120
or you know latest grow or

158
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,600
product review but

159
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,759
we always try to keep that aspect of uh

160
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:30,000
keeping it like loose and free and you

161
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:32,319
know if we want to talk about something

162
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
totally sidebar we do and you know it

163
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,520
happens often especially with guests

164
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,120
because

165
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:39,599
the whole

166
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,519
criteria for us doing this was we wanted

167
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,199
people to come on the show and feel like

168
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:45,758
they were smoking with us right like we

169
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,840
wanted the listeners at home to feel

170
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,360
like oh [ __ ] yeah like i feel like i'm

171
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:51,439
at a smoke sesh right now with these

172
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,319
guys and it wanted to keep it really

173
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:56,959
like low key and and comfortable

174
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:59,520
uh our first guests weren't

175
00:06:56,959 --> 00:07:02,638
super you know experienced podcasters

176
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:04,318
right so it kind of helped ease them in

177
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,519
by you know it's just a regular

178
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,919
conversation and we're going to pass

179
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:08,879
around a joint and you know we

180
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:10,159
kind of

181
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:12,560
that's the one thing we want to keep

182
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:15,280
going forward is that that vibe

183
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,879
oh yeah that's important i think a lot

184
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:19,198
of people that are at home especially

185
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:21,519
stoners that are into like our kind of

186
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:24,240
niche of podcasting that's what they're

187
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:26,159
looking for is not that i mean we all

188
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,000
know we love information learning more

189
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,840
about this plant it's [ __ ] amazing if

190
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,918
you can find some other way to

191
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:33,598
incorporate something into your grow

192
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:35,598
that's going to work with it then you

193
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:36,959
get down that wormhole it doesn't matter

194
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:39,279
and you just keep going down that

195
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:41,359
wormhole and learning more and more but

196
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:43,279
as stoners there's also

197
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,120
so much attention time that you have for

198
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:46,799
it you know before you start going off

199
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,199
into the other stuff so if it gets too

200
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,680
serious they kind of throw me off i've

201
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:54,639
listened to quite a few that are very

202
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:56,560
very scientific cannabis podcasts and i

203
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,240
can listen to them and i love them but i

204
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,000
can only listen to so much before i'm

205
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,840
like okay i need to take this

206
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,120
information and

207
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:04,878
you know

208
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,000
break that [ __ ] down then i'll take some

209
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,240
more you know

210
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,240
so it helps to break that ice especially

211
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,000
when you're getting guests on um to

212
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,759
throw curveballs like that which i will

213
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,519
be doing with you guys

214
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,120
i want to ask each of you though really

215
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:19,038
quick

216
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:22,560
individually

217
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:22,560
what was your favorite episode

218
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,960
that's you

219
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:29,520
it's hard to quantify that

220
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:31,680
and i think um when we were on we were

221
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:33,519
just recently on another podcast with

222
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,918
derek um

223
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:37,519
and he asked us a very similar question

224
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:39,519
and it's very hard to nail it down

225
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:41,918
because they're especially our guest

226
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,599
episodes there's just so much

227
00:08:41,918 --> 00:08:45,360
information packed in there as well as

228
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,040
like people's story and stuff like that

229
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,159
and it's

230
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:52,240
it's hard to just like say one episode

231
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:54,240
but i think my favorite type of episode

232
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,680
is when we would just get stupid high i

233
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,440
guess i'll break it into a type is when

234
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:59,838
we just get dumb high we'll start off

235
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,600
talking about weed um but yeah like you

236
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:03,120
said it just kind of just goes in in a

237
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,200
completely different direction and those

238
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,720
are fun because you

239
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,240
at a certain point of the conversation

240
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,320
the mics aren't in front of you anymore

241
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,000
in your head you're just you're just

242
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,120
talking and then you don't

243
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,958
you don't

244
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,879
have any expectation for the show and

245
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:18,399
those are just so freelance um when

246
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:19,759
having guests on it there's more of a

247
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:21,759
structure to it right you want to dig

248
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:23,120
into them and those are great in their

249
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:24,720
own right because like i said there's

250
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,959
nuggets of information and stuff like

251
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,639
that that you can get from these people

252
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:30,079
um about you know

253
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:32,799
the way they grow or whatever but yeah

254
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:35,440
the freelance free form

255
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:38,000
smoking just uh episodes were really

256
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,760
really fun but i i can't say a favorite

257
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,360
i got one that's been coming to my mind

258
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:43,360
lately i i won't

259
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,120
i guess i'll give the political uh put

260
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,560
it out front i love every single one of

261
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,959
our guests and i'm glad that they gave

262
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:51,119
us the time that they did and you know

263
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:52,719
most people especially the breeder

264
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,080
episodes like i learned so much just

265
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,839
from talking

266
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,000
to somebody for an hour right so they're

267
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:00,080
they're super cool but man my favorite

268
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,519
was like we we had

269
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:05,600
this girl on name alya but we had done a

270
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:08,159
back-to-back so right before we had her

271
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,920
on we were doing another recording with

272
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:11,278
my homie yonder

273
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:13,519
and uh

274
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:14,799
he was just there like he was like yeah

275
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:16,320
i was like you want to stick around dude

276
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:17,919
like you can just keep smoking with us

277
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,480
and he was like yeah sure so like we

278
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:23,120
just surprised guests on this other

279
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:25,120
podcast and i mean it was really fun we

280
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,879
smoked and you know i he actually

281
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,639
brought some stuff to that one too so i

282
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:30,958
was like oh okay this ended up being

283
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:32,559
okay but it was just a super long

284
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:34,719
session i'm like yeah [ __ ] it dude you

285
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:37,278
can be here i was already high at that

286
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:39,120
point so it sounded like you're going

287
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:40,799
yeah

288
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,639
there's certainly an evolution to our

289
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:44,479
podcast though there's those days where

290
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:46,480
we would go for like two or three hours

291
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,480
and put that whole episode together and

292
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,120
would just go off on just the most

293
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,639
random random things we could find

294
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,000
whatever was in the news or whatever

295
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:55,278
that was just kind of a funny story we

296
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,879
would talk about it and then have our

297
00:10:55,278 --> 00:10:58,480
own

298
00:10:56,879 --> 00:11:00,399
opinion on it but

299
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,639
yeah no definitely we've kind of gone

300
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:04,958
into this more cannabis niche and we're

301
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:06,879
still open to having whoever on and

302
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:10,078
talking about anything i mean we've had

303
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:11,519
you know people yoga instructors do um

304
00:11:10,078 --> 00:11:14,559
you know aaliyah you were just talking

305
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:16,320
about uh she she's like a very mindful

306
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:18,639
type person um

307
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:21,600
yeah like more spirituality mindfulness

308
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:22,879
like positivity kind of thing yeah uh

309
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,240
we've had

310
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:26,639
people who were

311
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:29,200
you know into cooking and i mean i've

312
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:31,600
had people in oklahoma that

313
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,600
we did like a pokemon card episode and

314
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,079
that was pretty fun with my homie riley

315
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:39,680
and he's random too but like 90 of the

316
00:11:36,078 --> 00:11:39,679
episode was like pokemon guards

317
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,640
i like the ones that are unexpected like

318
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,480
that you know if if it's too structured

319
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:48,159
it's not fun anymore

320
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,519
yeah right you have to have those

321
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:50,480
[ __ ] hooks

322
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,440

323
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:55,200
so i didn't even ask you guys i see

324

we're in two different places but we're

335
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:18,078

a tiki madman

339
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:28,079
collab situation from a while ago that

340
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:30,879
we had at our facility um

341
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:32,958
when i first started working there

342
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:34,958
the first iteration of this that i tried

343
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:36,159
was like not

344
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:38,319
not good

345
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:40,240
uh you know like i'm sorry it sounds

346
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,480
like you're going really easy

347
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:45,120
yeah it was it was pretty trash dude and

348
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:47,920
like i was it was harsh and i was like

349
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,360
oh man this is like this can't be what

350
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:51,278
we're putting out all the time right

351
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,879
like you know like in my head and i

352
00:12:51,278 --> 00:12:54,879
wasn't gonna say that at a brand new job

353
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:57,200
but i was like damn dude this is this is

354
00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:58,958
rough and then uh

355
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,879
you know we tried it a couple more times

356
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:02,879
and it just never

357
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:04,159
got the legs it never got to where it

358
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:05,759
was gonna go but then they were like hey

359
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:08,159
we wanna we really want this to work

360
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:10,958
right so they tried it one more time

361
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:12,639
actually this last time dude it's

362
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:14,319
it's good you know it's got potential

363
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,079
and i'm like okay well if you know if we

364
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,920
tweaked this a little bit more i'd [ __ ]

365
00:13:16,078 --> 00:13:20,719
with this hardcore it's it smells good

366
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:23,199
it's got good structure now uh and i

367
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:25,680
mean the high is pretty great i'm pretty

368
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:28,000
focused it's more like on the hybrid

369
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:29,519
sativa side of life for me and we don't

370
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,519
have a lot of those at our facility most

371
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:32,720
of [ __ ] is like knockout like straight

372
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,560
indica

373
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,720
put you down into the floor

374
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:38,958
and the ones we do are like the citrus

375
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,879
terps which are seem like in in at least

376
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:42,479
washington that's like the bottom of

377
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:44,480
people's choice

378
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,320
uh for terpene profiles so it's it's

379
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,399
hard um

380
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,399
but those ones we have also they're

381
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,000
they're a sherb cross it's emergency

382
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:55,360
from sea junkie they released it a

383
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:58,240
little while ago but it's sherb to uh

384
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,839
blow pops orange orange blow pops uh so

385
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,079
it's got citrus but it also has like

386
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,040
some sherb to it so it it kind of is a

387
00:14:02,078 --> 00:14:05,359
good

388
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:07,599
segue i guess into it rather than it

389
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,759
just being like full force chop cookies

390
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,680
yeah

391
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:14,078
like the name drop with the chop cookies

392
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:15,919
for sure we we have a very

393
00:14:14,078 --> 00:14:18,078
love-hate relationship with the chopped

394
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:21,198
cookies

395
00:14:18,078 --> 00:14:23,838
this is all dangly [ __ ] it is

396
00:14:21,198 --> 00:14:25,919
and it's like the bud tastes so good

397
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:28,399
when tropicana cookies is grown right

398
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:31,360
it's really really tasty bud

399
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:33,519
the high it's not bad it's not the best

400
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:36,159
but it's not bad at all yeah but yeah

401
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:37,679
just growing her she's just kind of a

402
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:39,919
[ __ ]

403
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:41,919
oh you could tell people like with warm

404
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:43,039
cookies tropicana cookies at the end of

405
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:44,479
the grow

406
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:46,319
it's kind of like you got a finger in

407
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,079
the bubble at the end of sex like you're

408
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,360
like oh that was nice but

409
00:14:48,078 --> 00:14:51,759
yeah and then you go to harvest it and

410
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,919
you're really like i got [ __ ] up

411
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:55,759
because they're like this small after

412
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:58,879
they dry they're just tiny little

413
00:14:55,759 --> 00:15:00,559
cookies ugly yeah exactly but they are

414
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:02,159
some pretty flowers too

415
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:03,919
yeah and they taste good right they have

416
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:05,600
their place it's just yeah it takes some

417
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:08,078
patience extracts

418
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,360
that's extract for sure yeah yeah that

419
00:15:08,078 --> 00:15:10,078
would be a good one

420
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,879
so

421
00:15:10,078 --> 00:15:14,638
when did both of you get into growing

422
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:15,919
like what was your first experience with

423
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,759
cannabis

424
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:19,439
i'll let you go that's chronologically

425
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:21,360
yeah um

426
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,199
you know it's hard to put a date on it

427
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:27,199
uh i don't know exactly when i just know

428
00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:28,319
it was roughly when i was around 20

429
00:15:27,198 --> 00:15:30,078
21

430
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,600
uh i believe it was 21 because we had

431
00:15:30,078 --> 00:15:33,679
dispensaries here and i was able i was

432
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,800
buying wheat out of dispensaries so 21

433
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:36,159
we'll say that

434
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:38,479
um

435
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:40,559
we i've been hold up back

436
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,320
i've been smoking since i was 16. that's

437
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:44,159
when i first first got introduced to it

438
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,959
i was in high school um

439
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:47,278
and

440
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:48,799
was really off and on with it

441
00:15:47,278 --> 00:15:51,439
and then had some friends who whose

442
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:53,679
parents grew and stuff like that and was

443
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,920
constantly around weed right and i had

444
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:57,198
access to it so i just

445
00:15:55,919 --> 00:15:58,399
and then i

446
00:15:57,198 --> 00:15:59,919
i got

447
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:03,679
to the point where i was like smoking

448
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:06,399
daily like i am now and so uh it got to

449
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:08,958
a point to where uh me and my buddy were

450
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:11,120
just like we really want to grow this

451
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:13,039
it was a different buddy before i met

452
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:16,159
josh and um

453
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:16,159
started growing with him but

454
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:21,519
we decided that we wanted to grow the

455
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,839
weed and hope in hopes to make some

456
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:26,000
money not make money off it but like i

457
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:27,279
guess recoup our money from

458
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,198
the it's like spending it on

459
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:31,360
dispensaries so rather than spending it

460
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:33,278
at the dyspo that weed is kicking in so

461
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,720
i'm kind of rambling here that tends to

462
00:16:33,278 --> 00:16:37,278
happen i'm sorry

463
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,360
um

464
00:16:37,278 --> 00:16:41,360
we got some we got some seeds he ordered

465
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,399
some up out of like amsterdam or

466
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,240
something like that there were some

467
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:46,320
northern lights um that he was a real

468
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,360
big fan of and so we decided to grow

469
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,959
that

470
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,560
and it was like sketchy style right like

471
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:52,719
send them a money order and then hope

472
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:54,159
the seeds come later yeah but it was his

473
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,519
money so i was totally okay with it

474
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:58,319
happening i was like all right if you

475
00:16:55,519 --> 00:17:00,240
want to do that man like whatever um but

476
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,720
yeah we grew those in a kind of [ __ ]

477
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:06,000
way uh we grew them in soil to start

478
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,720
under some like um cfl bulbs like two of

479
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,919
them

480
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,558
um

481
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:13,919
and then he had been reading a lot about

482
00:17:10,558 --> 00:17:15,519
like dwc and stuff like that and

483
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,799
he was like i think i want to do that

484
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:18,959
and so he was like i think i want to

485
00:17:16,798 --> 00:17:21,359
transplant the ones that we have in soil

486
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:23,759
they were about like yay big

487
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:25,279
um and uh

488
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:26,640
i don't know why we thought that that

489
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:28,078
would be a good idea but we were brand

490
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,600
new to it so like all right i was like

491
00:17:28,078 --> 00:17:31,200
all right you think this is gonna work

492
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:33,439
and he's like yeah you just gotta wash

493
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,120
off the roots and set them in this

494
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,759
hydroton stuff and i was like all right

495
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:39,839
man like whatever um

496
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:42,480
like out of the i think we had like five

497
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:45,519
or six plants like three two or three of

498
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:47,440
them made it um and we had swapped he

499
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:50,160
had bought like one of those blurple

500
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:54,000
lights off amazon for like 100 bucks um

501
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:55,279
the ones with the fans that uh are awful

502
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,839
um

503
00:17:55,279 --> 00:18:00,399
i've seen some really good bud off of a

504
00:17:57,839 --> 00:18:02,480
couple of those brands uh i know what

505
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,160
you're talking about but like uh

506
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,759
god damn now i can't even think of the

507
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,960
name of them either but like viper

508
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:09,119
spectra

509
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,200
yeah viper spectra was one of them there

510
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:13,038
was like bloom i don't know bloom plus

511
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,558
was kind of like a yellow there's a few

512
00:18:13,038 --> 00:18:16,798
of them though the viper spectra are the

513
00:18:14,558 --> 00:18:19,038
ones that come to mind the most

514
00:18:16,798 --> 00:18:20,960
like the onboard fans that would you

515
00:18:19,038 --> 00:18:22,720
know blow all the heat away from the

516
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,319
light and whatnot but yeah i've seen

517
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,160
some really pretty buds on there it's

518
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:27,759
just a matter of your environment this

519
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,160
wasn't this wasn't like a bootleg

520
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:32,079
version of not this one

521
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,679
no and you know we didn't know [ __ ]

522
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:35,119
about environment or anything like that

523
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:38,400
they were growing under this little

524
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:40,879
under the stairs closet in there um

525
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:43,759
and i mean we did decent there was it

526
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:47,679
was it wasn't successful i wouldn't say

527
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:49,759
i don't i don't ever remember really

528
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:51,679
i can't even think of harvesting that

529
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:53,599
bud like i can't even remember that

530
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:57,640
that's how like i don't

531
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:57,639
that's why i can't say it was successful

532
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:04,558
we did some really really dumb stuff and

533
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,160
i continue to do dumb stuff but i'm a

534
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:09,279
little more calculated with it now like

535
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:11,200
i understand components right yeah yeah

536
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:14,000
no you're never going to be perfect you

537
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:16,080
know 24 7 ain't going to happen sorry

538
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,679
but that was my introduction to you know

539
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:19,279
growing weed and

540
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:21,600
eventually you know did some butt

541
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:24,000
tending stuff uh and then finally made

542
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:26,480
my way into a grow here in washington so

543
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:30,640
oh yeah man that's awesome

544
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:31,360
yeah so did garrett influence you josh

545
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,120
no

546
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:36,319
like a little bit i was thinking about

547
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:37,599
it at the time we were working together

548
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:40,240
uh

549
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:42,159
just like started construction together

550
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,720
like we were doing some like remodel

551
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,400
type stuff with this investor guy and i

552
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,759
i had been to his house i'd smoked over

553
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,840
there i'd seen

554
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:51,759
you know the tent or the little grow

555
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:54,240
space you know with the blurple light

556
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:55,919
you'd open it up like oh god and then

557
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,440
let your eyes adjust for like three

558
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:59,520
seconds and then you could actually see

559
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,038
the plant uh

560
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:02,400
you know like [ __ ] around with that

561
00:20:01,038 --> 00:20:04,798
and i was like okay well they're doing

562
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:07,200
the thing and then you know i'd seen

563
00:20:04,798 --> 00:20:08,879
when they started doing the dwc there

564
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:11,360
was the like three in there and the five

565
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:13,840
gallon buckets like i remember that

566
00:20:11,359 --> 00:20:15,439
and shortly after that time

567
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:18,079
my brother

568
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:20,640
hit me up and he was like hey

569
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:21,678
i started growing this weed plant

570
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,520
uh

571
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:25,679
but i don't know what's wrong with it

572
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:27,759
could you figure it out and he asked me

573
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:29,440
because he knew i knew people who grow

574
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:32,240
weed and he you know he's like i don't

575
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,120
know anybody right so i'm like okay well

576
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,798
let me

577
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:36,399
see what's up like send me a picture of

578
00:20:34,798 --> 00:20:38,319
your plant

579
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,640
and he sends me this picture and it's

580
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:42,000
it's a [ __ ] like you know 18 inch

581
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,159
plant

582
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,640
and it's in a

583
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,600
like you know those soup bowls

584
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,600
uh

585
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:51,918
but are also mugs like it's got the

586
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:54,399
little mug handle on it yeah like bigger

587
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:57,120
mug so he had it in that

588
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,960
uh so i would say maybe like a solo cup

589
00:20:57,119 --> 00:21:01,519
and a half worth of

590
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:04,720
dirt for this 18 inch

591
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:07,359
uh plant any drainage holes

592
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:10,880
uh no uh-uh nope it was like just

593
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:12,959
sitting in soup pretty much uh

594
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:16,720
and he had

595
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:18,319
he had it growing in the windowsill

596
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:20,798
but like facing the south side of the

597
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:23,038
house so there was never like any direct

598
00:21:20,798 --> 00:21:24,079
sunlight ever it was just always like

599
00:21:23,038 --> 00:21:26,798
getting

600
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:29,199
ambient sunlight from the window

601
00:21:26,798 --> 00:21:31,200
and i was like okay so right off the bat

602
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,919
i don't know a lot about a lot right now

603
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:35,440
but i know that you need lights to grow

604
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:36,960
weak i know that you can't just put it

605
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,480
in your windowsill and do the thing it's

606
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,720
at least got to be like outside like

607
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:43,038
catching a lot of sun right like you

608
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,720
can't that's number one and i was like

609
00:21:43,038 --> 00:21:47,440
number two like

610
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,960
that's not a pot dude that's a cup like

611
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:51,200
you need to get it out of the cup and

612
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,880
into like an actual pot for plants like

613
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,480
you know i'm like that's that's what i'm

614
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,919
thinking and he was like okay well like

615
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,839
do you want to take it because i can't

616
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:58,960
grow it any bigger than it is now and i

617
00:21:57,839 --> 00:22:00,798
was like

618
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,159
sure man but it's probably going to die

619
00:22:00,798 --> 00:22:03,599
right like i was like it's already in a

620
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:05,280
bad spot it looks hella sick it's like

621
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:08,959
turning yellow it's got different spots

622
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:11,359
on the leaves yeah like spider mites too

623
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:13,200
it was just like like this plant was

624
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:16,079
doomed to fail right and i was like [ __ ]

664
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,559
and i like hung it and i put it over

665
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,400
this little plant and this like i think

666
00:23:36,558 --> 00:23:40,079
i transplanted it into like a plastic

667
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,960
one gallon

668
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:41,678
uh

669
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,000
and

670
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:46,480
it came back to life dude like it just

671
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,798
said it lived

672
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:50,640
yeah so i was like okay well now i

673
00:23:48,798 --> 00:23:52,319
actually have to grow this [ __ ] plant

674
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,080
right like it didn't die

675
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:55,918
uh so now i'm like researching and i'm

676
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:57,759
looking at all this i'm asking garrett a

677
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:59,440
million seven questions right like oh

678
00:23:57,759 --> 00:24:01,440
what about this and you know like he's

679
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:03,120
letting me borrow newts and

680
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,880
[ __ ] like that and coming and checking

681
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:06,319
on the plant and like we floured this

682
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,240
thing out we ended up like

683
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:10,558
he had some pollen from one of his

684
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:12,000
plants and we ended up seeding like

685
00:24:10,558 --> 00:24:13,918
half of it

686
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,359
and we got hella seeds off of it now we

687
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:17,440
still have them to this day like that's

688
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:19,519
like a supposedly the

689
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:22,320
bag seed that my brother grew was from

690
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:24,558
acapulco gold but like i can't

691
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:26,240
confirm or deny that so i i'm not gonna

692
00:24:24,558 --> 00:24:27,839
call it that i'm like i'm not gonna say

693
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,000
this is a land race

00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:32,798
without knowing for sure it was it was

695

i guess they're on heroin so that is a

812
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:46,639
downer so maybe that like made them a

813
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,079
little yeah but like you know that i

814
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,759

your eye man what's that

923
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:43,120
uh this is hebrew for protector of

924
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,798
israel my son's name's israel and i

925
00:32:43,119 --> 00:32:47,518
wanted to get a tattoo for him but i

926
00:32:44,798 --> 00:32:49,200
like he came super early so the time i

927
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:51,038
had to think and plan this out was like

928
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:53,679
cut down to like two days

929
00:32:51,038 --> 00:32:54,879
uh and so i was like oh okay i'm just

930
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:58,320
gonna get this

931
00:32:54,880 --> 00:33:00,799
and i had a homie who was uh

932
00:32:58,319 --> 00:33:02,158
he'd studied hebrew so he like was like

933
00:33:00,798 --> 00:33:04,000
i think these are the words you're going

934
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:05,679
to look for and so i did i looked it up

935
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,679
on google and sure [ __ ] there the words

936
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:10,000
that he said that they were going to be

937
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:11,679
and then this lady who was jewish that i

938
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,200
met later she like read it and she was

939
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:14,000
like oh that's so cute blah blah blah

940
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,679
like

941
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,278
no problem so i was like okay it doesn't

942
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:18,640
say like soy sauce or something on my

943
00:33:17,278 --> 00:33:20,319
arm like

944
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:22,960
i wanted it to say

945
00:33:20,319 --> 00:33:25,119
uh yeah worked out good got it in

946
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:27,038
oklahoma like right before i came to see

947
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:29,518
my son

948
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:30,720
i saw this image one time it cracked me

949
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:32,960
up

950
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,720
but it shows all these americans walking

951
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:36,558
around with like chinese letters and

952
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:38,798
stuff tattooed on their arm and then

953
00:33:36,558 --> 00:33:40,798
said imagine if china was like this and

954
00:33:38,798 --> 00:33:43,679
they just had like water written on

955
00:33:40,798 --> 00:33:43,679
their arm in english

956
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:49,599
and i never thought about chinese single

957
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:51,679
tattoos the same after that

958
00:33:49,599 --> 00:33:53,918
they're so much better than like but i

959
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:56,000
mean people do that right people tattoo

960
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:58,000
[ __ ] stupid words up their forearms

961
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,558
or across their chest or like that's a

962
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,480
thing it looks cool i like the japanese

963
00:34:00,558 --> 00:34:04,798
characters i like chinese characters you

964
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:06,720
know it's cool writing but uh when you

965
00:34:04,798 --> 00:34:09,119
think of it in that perspective just

966
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,639
like yeah yeah it's weird like imagine

967
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:12,559
going to the country and that's their

968
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:14,320
thing you'd be like why do you have that

969
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:15,918
just going and also country and yeah

970
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:18,240
seeing english letters tattooed on

971
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:19,679
somebody's half of the half the tattoos

972
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:21,759
would be something weird because they

973
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:24,000
think it's this but it's not it's like

974
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,919
translates all weird word yeah and so

975
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,239
you're like

976
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:30,638
that dude on your body like that

977
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:31,759
please don't barn door written

978
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:35,838
yeah

979
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:35,839
this means strength and you're like

980
00:34:36,398 --> 00:34:39,679
you see it all the time with like i

981
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:42,159
don't know like you'll there'll be memes

982
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:43,679
essentially of it but it's like

983
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:45,280
clothing a lot of the clothing over

984
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:48,159
there they'll like knock off clothing is

985
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:50,879
like misinterpreted or miss

986
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:53,919
so i assume the same principles would

987
00:34:50,878 --> 00:34:56,719
happen if you were to get a tattoo

988
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:59,199
of an english word

989
00:34:56,719 --> 00:35:00,480
yeah oh yeah 100

990
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:02,719
exactly

991
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:04,400
and plus english is such a [ __ ] hard

992
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:08,319
language to like learn and understand

any other way you have something better

998
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:19,039
right yeah i need a chinese person

999
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:21,119

1000
00:35:19,039 --> 00:35:24,159
bilingual chinese english like they're

1001
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:26,000
genius they're leather level

1002
00:35:24,159 --> 00:35:28,799
i i know

1003
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:31,199
quite a few languages but i'm not fluent

1004
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:33,119
in like any of them except for english i

1005
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:34,879
can get by with most of them if i sit

1006
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:36,400
there and i listen and i take my time to

1007
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:38,480
speak it back and think about what i'm

1008
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:40,639
saying but i'm not just like off the

1009
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:42,559
cusp oh yeah i got this you know

1010
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:44,000
even that's impressive dude like just

1011
00:35:42,559 --> 00:35:45,440
being able to understand and communicate

1012
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,760
with people like even if it took you a

1013
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:49,599
long time because i think about meeting

1014
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:51,760
you know people from different countries

1015
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:53,359
here in america and like any english

1016
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:55,359
that they speak i'm like yeah dude like

1017
00:35:53,358 --> 00:35:56,880
i'll [ __ ] like tell me like i want to

1018
00:35:55,358 --> 00:35:58,719
hear what you're saying you know even if

1019
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:00,000
it's broken and they got a thick accent

1020
00:35:58,719 --> 00:36:02,000
like whatever i'm going to try to

1021
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,079
understand and so i feel like it's the

1022
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,280
same right like they just appreciate

1023
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:07,440
that you're trying to communicate with

1024
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:09,280
them in a way that they can understand

1025
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:10,800
so like they're like yeah

1026
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,960
dope

1027
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:15,280
so if you could learn any other language

1028
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,800
what would you learn

1029
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:21,040
i'm already kind of halfway there with

1030
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:22,640
spanish just you know heritage wise but

1031
00:36:21,039 --> 00:36:24,880
maybe japanese

1032
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:27,358
i watch a lot of anime

1033
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:29,358
like a dumb amount in fact i don't watch

1034
00:36:27,358 --> 00:36:30,719
any tv period except for anime like

1035
00:36:29,358 --> 00:36:33,440
there's not another show where i'm like

1036
00:36:30,719 --> 00:36:35,679
yeah i watched that like maybe once a

1037
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:37,119
year i'll like watch a different type of

1038
00:36:35,679 --> 00:36:40,559
show but like

1039
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:42,880
it's 90 of the time it's anime

1040
00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:45,519
right huh now that makes a lot of sense

1041
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:47,760
my first instinct is just to say russian

1042
00:36:45,519 --> 00:36:50,079
and i think the only reason why is

1043
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:51,920
because like i don't know it sounds cool

1044
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:53,920
um similar to german like i already know

1045
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:55,358
a little bit of german and have gone

1046
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:57,680
over and visited for a couple weeks

1047
00:36:55,358 --> 00:37:00,159
there through an exchange program which

1048
00:36:57,679 --> 00:37:02,239
was really cool um but awesome i don't

1049
00:37:00,159 --> 00:37:03,679
know russian and plus i play a lot of

1050
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:05,679
video games and some of those video

1051
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:08,960
games have a big russian fan base like

1052
00:37:05,679 --> 00:37:09,838
cs go or like escape from tarkov then so

1053
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,519
like i don't know to be able to

1054
00:37:09,838 --> 00:37:12,960
communicate or just like talk [ __ ] to

1055
00:37:11,519 --> 00:37:15,358
them

1056
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:16,800
[ __ ] to americans in that game uh that'd

1057
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:18,319
be kind of yeah i don't know funny i

1058
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,720
learned the whole language just to talk

1059
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:22,880
[ __ ] online

1060
00:37:20,719 --> 00:37:24,639
also probably kind of like low-key

1061
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:26,880
useful in the political climate right

1062
00:37:24,639 --> 00:37:29,118
now right oh yeah

1063
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:32,079
that's awesome

1064
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:34,400
russian and german are two very angry

1065
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:36,480
sounding languages yeah

1066
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,280
and like i'm not gonna lie german is

1067
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,519
like

1068
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:41,200
it's like an ugly language to me when i

1069
00:37:39,519 --> 00:37:43,759
like when i think about german it

1070
00:37:41,199 --> 00:37:45,519
doesn't it's not soft and like sweet and

1071
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:47,680
like sound good it's like if somebody

1072
00:37:45,519 --> 00:37:49,119
was gonna yell at me or like be mean it

1073
00:37:47,679 --> 00:37:50,639
would sound good in german but if

1074
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:51,920
somebody wanted to like swoopy talk

1075
00:37:50,639 --> 00:37:53,279
sweet enough things into my ear and a

1076
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,639
whisper and they were speaking german

1077
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,320
i'd be like oh like

1078
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:58,159
what are you doing

1079
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:00,240
it's just a lot of consonants

1080
00:37:58,159 --> 00:38:02,879
i don't know any russian at all but i

1081
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:04,959
knew a little bit of ukrainian and at

1082
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,880
the time i did not know that there was

1083
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:08,720
much of a difference but i had a couple

1084
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:10,880
friends that were russian and i had a

1085
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:12,559
couple other friends that were ukrainian

1086
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:14,559
the ukrainians were the ones that were

1087
00:38:12,559 --> 00:38:15,838
teaching me ukrainian but then i would

1088
00:38:14,559 --> 00:38:17,279
talk to my russian friends and they

1089
00:38:15,838 --> 00:38:18,880
would understand what i was saying but

1090
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,640
they look at me like

1091
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,640
you're saying that like all messed up

1092
00:38:20,639 --> 00:38:25,440
and i was like it's ukrainian they're

1093
00:38:22,639 --> 00:38:27,838
like yeah it's like slang it's like

1094
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:30,639
it's like hispanic compared to like true

1095
00:38:27,838 --> 00:38:32,719
spanish yeah like they understand each

1096
00:38:30,639 --> 00:38:35,440
other but it's like yeah but people from

1097
00:38:32,719 --> 00:38:37,039
spain are like yeah on a different

1098
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:39,440
on a different level like i don't even

1099
00:38:37,039 --> 00:38:41,599
like hearing them talk some of the like

1100
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:43,519
ways that they

1101
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:45,838
put accents on their word or like the

1102
00:38:43,519 --> 00:38:47,519
way they like say the th sound of like

1103
00:38:45,838 --> 00:38:48,799
with a lisp it's like

1104
00:38:47,519 --> 00:38:50,719
like they're constantly spitting on

1105
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,680
yours and then yeah

1106
00:38:50,719 --> 00:38:54,159
it doesn't

1107
00:38:51,679 --> 00:38:55,679
it doesn't sound very good to me it's

1108
00:38:54,159 --> 00:38:57,920
more akin to like

1109
00:38:55,679 --> 00:38:59,919
that type of spanish though is like how

1110
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:01,358
i get like french and italian and them

1111
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:04,480
being all the same thing because it's

1112
00:39:01,358 --> 00:39:08,319
kind of all got that same error of

1113
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:11,358
whatever that latin base yeah

1114
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:13,838
oh yeah so i didn't even ask you guys i

1115
00:39:11,358 --> 00:39:16,319
asked you what you were smoking on

1116
00:39:13,838 --> 00:39:20,078
what's your favorite type of cannabis

1117
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:22,000
like what do you primarily go after

1118
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:24,560
the

1119
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:28,650
i would say like the the necrotic type

1120
00:39:24,559 --> 00:39:31,920
of effect or not

1121
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:33,760
[Laughter]

1124
00:39:35,679 --> 00:39:39,039

i don't know maybe ten legal countries

1176
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:25,358
like we we're the only ones that they

1177
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,559
don't ship to like

1178
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:27,679
directly

1179
00:41:26,559 --> 00:41:31,119

1180
00:41:27,679 --> 00:41:32,159

1185
00:41:37,838 --> 00:41:41,358
[ __ ] i probably should grow you know

1186
00:41:39,519 --> 00:41:43,358
that i'm just like looking at like i got

1187
00:41:41,358 --> 00:41:46,838
my little collection but like you don't

1188
00:41:43,358 --> 00:41:49,920
need a good amsterdam that's right here

1189
00:41:46,838 --> 00:41:51,759
buddy i'm about it thank you sir uh i'll

1190
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:53,838
get you taken care of but yeah like

1191
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:56,079
those like lemony like citrusy or

1192
00:41:53,838 --> 00:41:59,039
grapefruity kind of like

1193
00:41:56,079 --> 00:42:01,519
notes with like some funk like some like

1194
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:03,599
like some feet or some some something

1195
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:04,639
you know like or some skunkiness like i

1196
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:06,240
i don't know i kind of like that

1197
00:42:04,639 --> 00:42:10,000
contrast and

1198
00:42:06,239 --> 00:42:11,838
the effects for me are always kind of

1199
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,159
like they don't mellow me out they keep

1200
00:42:11,838 --> 00:42:16,880
me focused and i i like being able to

1201
00:42:14,159 --> 00:42:20,159
like be happy and be relaxed but also be

1202
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:24,160
able to do things uh i am 90 certain i

1203
00:42:20,159 --> 00:42:26,239
have like some undiagnosed add adhd

1204
00:42:24,159 --> 00:42:27,679
and so like having something that like

1205
00:42:26,239 --> 00:42:29,598
helps me

1206
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:31,838
stay on target for longer than six

1207
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:33,359
seconds is dope right so i'm like oh i

1208
00:42:31,838 --> 00:42:35,119
love that weed like that that weed's

1209
00:42:33,358 --> 00:42:37,759
good for me because i can literally head

1210
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:39,760
down on this task focus in and just go

1211
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:42,160
and crush it

1212
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:45,040
oh yeah man would you say that limonene

1213
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:46,639
chirping was like one of your

1214
00:42:45,039 --> 00:42:49,119
more favorable

1215
00:42:46,639 --> 00:42:50,879
profiles

1216
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:52,160
but it's more like the funk from the

1217
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:53,920
like

1218
00:42:52,159 --> 00:42:55,199
because anything that smells like gmo or

1219
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,960
like just like makes you puke in your

1220
00:42:55,199 --> 00:42:58,159
mouth a little bit is really where i'm

1221
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:00,318
like ooh

1222
00:42:58,159 --> 00:43:02,639
i want to smoke that but like that with

1223
00:43:00,318 --> 00:43:03,440
that like someone's squeezing on top of

1224
00:43:02,639 --> 00:43:05,440
that

1225
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:06,800
you know like i like those combos

1226
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:09,519
because i don't like just straight up

1227
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:10,839
orange like tangy is cool but like

1228
00:43:09,519 --> 00:43:13,759
you know it's not my

1229
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:15,838
thing okay nice sometimes time it's got

1230
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:17,200
enough pining in there to be different

1231
00:43:15,838 --> 00:43:18,159
you know it's almost like an orangey

1232
00:43:17,199 --> 00:43:20,159
haze

1233
00:43:18,159 --> 00:43:22,318
and uh

1234
00:43:20,159 --> 00:43:23,598
but like when you get that funk but you

1235
00:43:22,318 --> 00:43:25,599
can you can get a little bit of the

1236
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:28,400
citrus i don't know that's a good combo

1237
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:30,318
for me yeah i think weed is situational

1238
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:31,920
like like you were that you were just

1239
00:43:30,318 --> 00:43:33,838
asking i was like what our favorite type

1240
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:36,000
is but yeah i think like you were saying

1241
00:43:33,838 --> 00:43:38,639
on a nice day like today i wouldn't like

1242
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,519
to just be on the couch zoned out you

1243
00:43:38,639 --> 00:43:41,440
know

1244
00:43:39,519 --> 00:43:42,960
um so yeah i think wheat is definitely

1245
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:44,880
situational there's plenty of times

1246
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:46,800
where i i fall josh and i have the

1247
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:48,559
similar palette when it comes to weed so

1248
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:50,000
yeah we're generally smoking and can

1249
00:43:48,559 --> 00:43:51,440
agree on the same things that's why

1250
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,199
we're good smoking buddies that's how

1251
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:54,800
this started because it was like that i

1252
00:43:53,199 --> 00:43:57,199
like that too okay let's get it we're

1253
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:59,519
gonna go smoke that

1254
00:43:57,199 --> 00:44:00,480
oh yeah dude that's a good smoke partner

1255
00:43:59,519 --> 00:44:02,960
to have

1256
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:04,400
yeah so we both worked at danks they

1257
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:06,318
would be like ooh have you tried that

1258
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:08,240
yet no and i'm like you should and then

1259
00:44:06,318 --> 00:44:11,838
you go get it you're like oh damn i'm

1260
00:44:08,239 --> 00:44:12,639
trusting that another agent yeah oh yeah

1261
00:44:11,838 --> 00:44:17,279
so

1262
00:44:12,639 --> 00:44:19,838
garrett uh what about chirping profiles

1263
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:22,960
anything but the haze

1264
00:44:19,838 --> 00:44:22,960
terpene profile i don't like

1265
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:27,280
like me like i don't mind the flavor

1266
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:30,000
right like i can get down on it but it

1267
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:32,720
just it puts my anxiety through the roof

1268
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,719
did you say that haze doesn't like me

1269
00:44:32,719 --> 00:44:36,959
correct

1270
00:44:34,719 --> 00:44:36,959
once

1271
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:42,400
honestly i'll smoke that stuff and i'm

1272
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:44,079
like damn that tastes really good i mean

1273
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:46,800
it's just like a refreshing pine tree or

1274
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:47,599
like you know some rosemary um

1275
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:49,680
not

1276
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:51,359
and then my body starts my heart starts

1277
00:44:49,679 --> 00:44:53,118
beating and i and then my brain starts

1278
00:44:51,358 --> 00:44:54,960
focusing solely on that and it's like oh

1279
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:56,640
that's beating pretty loud and then then

1280
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:59,039
you go through this

1281
00:44:56,639 --> 00:45:00,799
uh like stair step paradigm

1282
00:44:59,039 --> 00:45:02,719
yeah into this weird paranoia and you're

1283
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:03,760
like oh [ __ ] am i even breathing right

1284
00:45:02,719 --> 00:45:05,439
like this

1285
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:07,280
like it feels like something's in my

1286
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:08,639
lung maybe i should go to the hospital

1287
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:10,720
no you don't need to go to the hospital

1288
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:12,719
you're okay yeah that's just tough it

1289
00:45:10,719 --> 00:45:14,480
really [ __ ] with gary and like almost

1290
00:45:12,719 --> 00:45:16,719
like sometimes he's allergic to it like

1291
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:19,199
he'll like sneeze and get itchy eyes and

1292
00:45:16,719 --> 00:45:20,719
like oh [ __ ] yeah it's like no it's not

1293
00:45:19,199 --> 00:45:22,239
well yeah

1294
00:45:20,719 --> 00:45:24,959
and i'm over here like nah this shit's

1295
00:45:22,239 --> 00:45:24,959
pretty cool man

1296
00:45:26,719 --> 00:45:30,719
yeah that's our only difference it's

1297
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:32,639
like i'll smoke a straight up sativa

1298
00:45:30,719 --> 00:45:34,719
sativa and he's got to be careful about

1299
00:45:32,639 --> 00:45:37,039
which ones he does

1300
00:45:34,719 --> 00:45:38,399
there's there's i really really like

1301
00:45:37,039 --> 00:45:41,599
hazes

1302
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:44,240
but i do prefer a little bit of uh the

1303
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:46,480
indica i say that very [ __ ] loosely

1304
00:45:44,239 --> 00:45:48,239
uh indica but like more affy bread and

1305
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:50,480
do it where it's gonna bring it a step

1306
00:45:48,239 --> 00:45:52,159
down but it's still leaning towards the

1307
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:54,240
sativa side you know

1308
00:45:52,159 --> 00:45:56,159
right i can get down on the cross the

1309
00:45:54,239 --> 00:45:58,399
haze crosses like i've gotten some lemon

1310
00:45:56,159 --> 00:46:00,480
hazes that have done me all right uh

1311
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:01,440
super silver is my worst enemy

1312
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:04,079
um

1313
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:05,838
and then like just classic hazes is just

1314
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:07,920
not not for me like the old pifs and

1315
00:46:05,838 --> 00:46:09,599
stuff like that i just can't do it but

1316
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:12,159
there are there have been crosses that

1317
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:14,960
that i'm like oh i can i can enjoy this

1318
00:46:12,159 --> 00:46:17,679
this haze um but yeah not this not the

1319
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:19,760
straight ups not the pining heavy

1320
00:46:17,679 --> 00:46:21,679
uh go-getters

1321
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:24,400
i've been getting into growing a little

1322
00:46:21,679 --> 00:46:26,159
bit more of the hash cultivars just

1323
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:29,440
because i want to play with making my

1324
00:46:26,159 --> 00:46:31,598
own ash rosin okay so just

1325
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:33,760
made bubble hash for years pressed

1326
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:36,000
flower rosin but i've never gone through

1327
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:38,319
pressing my bubble hash because i covet

1328
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,318
bubble hash so much that if i have it i

1329
00:46:38,318 --> 00:46:42,800
just smoke it as bubble ash like i

1330
00:46:40,318 --> 00:46:44,480
[ __ ] love that like if i had to be on

1331
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:46,240
a desert island and they said there's

1332
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:48,159
only one method you can use from now on

1333
00:46:46,239 --> 00:46:51,838
and i'd be like give me some [ __ ] ash

1334
00:46:48,159 --> 00:46:53,598
what easy what makes that like what why

1335
00:46:51,838 --> 00:46:56,159
i i need to understand that i've never

1336
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:58,559
been able to like truly ask somebody why

1337
00:46:56,159 --> 00:47:00,159
like bubble hash or just it's usually

1338
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:01,838
some old dude coming in to buy it when i

1339
00:47:00,159 --> 00:47:03,358
was about tender and he would always hit

1340
00:47:01,838 --> 00:47:05,440
the hash and he's like dude this stuff

1341
00:47:03,358 --> 00:47:06,480
is legit and i've tried it myself right

1342
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:10,639
but like

1343
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:13,119
i don't like in your mind why is that so

1344
00:47:10,639 --> 00:47:16,000
like upper level

1345
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:18,640
i've always been a flower guy for the

1346
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:20,559
most part i enjoy rolling joints even

1347
00:47:18,639 --> 00:47:22,799
when dabs came around i didn't get into

1348
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:25,119
them for a long time just because it was

1349
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:26,800
like oh that got me high really quick

1350
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:28,960
but it takes the

1351
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:30,318
experience away from it when you're in a

1352
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:31,920
circle with your friends and [ __ ] and

1353
00:47:30,318 --> 00:47:33,679
you can sit there for you know a half

1354
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:35,358
hour pass around a couple joints or

1355
00:47:33,679 --> 00:47:37,118
something have these big long

1356
00:47:35,358 --> 00:47:40,078
conversations next to hey you want this

1357
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:42,000
dab done yeah and it was a little messy

1358
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:44,160
when it started out right like

1359
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,838
doing dabs way back in the day looked

1360
00:47:44,159 --> 00:47:47,598
really weird like some of the [ __ ]

1361
00:47:45,838 --> 00:47:49,838
looked like pickles and i was like a

1362
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:51,119
[ __ ] night

1363
00:47:49,838 --> 00:47:52,799
yeah

1364
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:54,640
yeah

1365
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:56,400
yeah i look like [ __ ] drugs it still

1366
00:47:54,639 --> 00:47:58,000
kind of does like my dad will come

1367
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:58,960
around and see me take a dab and he's

1368
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,000
just like

1369
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:05,039
your clothes is just weird

1370
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,039
that looks like [ __ ]

1371
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:10,640
so to answer your question

1372
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:12,960
i always appreciate joint speed because

1373
00:48:10,639 --> 00:48:14,879
it had the full flavor of the plant and

1374
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:17,519
that's what i love is the flavor of the

1375
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:20,000
plant i love that experience with it too

1376
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:22,159
hash when you're smoking bubble hash it

1377
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,318
burns for quite a while it's a thick

1378
00:48:22,159 --> 00:48:26,239
smoke but the thing is you've isolated

1379
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:28,558
those glands there's still a little bit

1380
00:48:26,239 --> 00:48:30,318
of contaminants whether it's stalks or

1381
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:33,040
like you know small leaf matter whatever

1382
00:48:30,318 --> 00:48:35,599
depending on what grade of hash you have

1383
00:48:33,039 --> 00:48:37,599
but i feel like you get all the

1384
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:39,519
cannabinoids every bit of that plant and

1385
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:41,838
that flavor is just packed there and

1386
00:48:39,519 --> 00:48:44,400
then when you press into hash rosin

1387
00:48:41,838 --> 00:48:46,078
unless your environments exactly you

1388
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:48,559
know like perfect like you have a cold

1389
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:51,440
room ready for it a cold environment

1390
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:53,200
cold storage cold water everything

1391
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:54,318
you know your spatulas everything are

1392
00:48:53,199 --> 00:48:56,000
cold

1393
00:48:54,318 --> 00:48:57,199
you're going to lose terpenes through

1394
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,800
the process

1395
00:48:57,199 --> 00:49:01,039
through processing it

1396
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:02,720
hash cures really well so the oxidation

1397
00:49:01,039 --> 00:49:04,480
on the outside will change the color of

1398
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:06,639
that and it'll make like a hard shell

1399
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:07,519
and kind of preserve everything that's

1400
00:49:06,639 --> 00:49:09,679
in there

1401
00:49:07,519 --> 00:49:11,759
so that i feel

1402
00:49:09,679 --> 00:49:13,519
i'm really interested in making the hash

1403
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:15,599
rosin just because pretty and i'm

1404
00:49:13,519 --> 00:49:18,000
interested in making consistencies like

1405
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:20,480
diamonds and sugar and because we blew

1406
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,318
bho back in the day but that shit's so

1407
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:24,719
[ __ ] bad for you you never get all of

1408
00:49:22,318 --> 00:49:27,759
that out even i'm not talking [ __ ] but

1409
00:49:24,719 --> 00:49:29,279
even a lot of uh the wreck industry i i

1410
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:31,440
taste some of these bhos shows and

1411
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:33,359
you're like there's it's definitely

1412
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:34,960
still in there like you can't have a

1413
00:49:33,358 --> 00:49:37,279
twang you're like

1414
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:38,720
yeah there's some really good guys doing

1415
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:41,040
it out there but then there's some that

1416
00:49:38,719 --> 00:49:43,199
you're just like okay you open it up and

1417
00:49:41,039 --> 00:49:45,119
that shit's like [ __ ] dark amber

1418
00:49:43,199 --> 00:49:48,719
orange and you're like

1419
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:48,720
[ __ ] see the butane in this

1420
00:49:49,838 --> 00:49:53,440
aaron uh no yeah

1421
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:55,920
was always the best for me

1422
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:57,679
okay you made me a believer sir like i

1423
00:49:55,920 --> 00:50:00,240
subscribed like you that was a good

1424
00:49:57,679 --> 00:50:01,679
explanation i'm like yeah yeah well as

1425
00:50:00,239 --> 00:50:03,679
you're talking about it i'm sitting over

1426
00:50:01,679 --> 00:50:06,078
here like me and josh have ranted and

1427
00:50:03,679 --> 00:50:07,838
raved about uh rosin like we would

1428
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:09,839
always say we would always talk about

1429
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:11,358
rosin in that way and like

1430
00:50:09,838 --> 00:50:13,440
that's just one step further than the

1431
00:50:11,358 --> 00:50:14,558
stuff you're smoking right so then you

1432
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:16,079
said you wanted to play around with the

1433
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:17,519
hash rosin and i was just questioning

1434
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:19,359
you on a question i already had the

1435
00:50:17,519 --> 00:50:20,639
answer to so

1436
00:50:19,358 --> 00:50:22,719
you know

1437
00:50:20,639 --> 00:50:24,558
sorry about that but i get it was just

1438
00:50:22,719 --> 00:50:26,799
it's just a different it's just a

1439
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:29,280
different process i guess like you don't

1440
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:31,519
dab the bubble hash right so

1441
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:33,440
i don't know i guess maybe it's like the

1442
00:50:31,519 --> 00:50:35,119
predecessor you know right it's just you

1443
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:37,119
know i get it like for me it's the

1444
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:37,920
cocoon version you know it's like it's

1445
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:39,838
good

1446
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:43,920
but when you like squish that into some

1447
00:50:39,838 --> 00:50:43,920
five star or six star or whatever like

1448
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:46,559
that is

1449
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:48,318
it's the plan right it's like the

1450
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:51,920
essence of the plan yeah they need to

1451
00:50:48,318 --> 00:50:54,639
start paying me to do ratings yeah dude

1452
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:57,119
that plan for sure okay so i've got my

1453
00:50:54,639 --> 00:50:58,960
second hook question for you guys

1454
00:50:57,119 --> 00:51:03,039
i'd rather sleep

1455
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:03,039
wearing handcuffs or a bike helmet

1456
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:06,838
uh

1457
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:09,440
can i like can i ask a question to the

1458
00:51:06,838 --> 00:51:11,199
question yeah the handcuffs in front of

1459
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:14,240

mean if you're freaking out the bike

1468
00:51:26,639 --> 00:51:31,358
helmet could be just as sexualized

1469
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:32,800
enough

1470
00:51:31,358 --> 00:51:35,519
no you're behind the back you're

1471
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:38,240

handcuffed

1475
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:44,720
my back for a little bit took a little

1476
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:46,719
nappy nap in the back of the

1477
00:51:44,719 --> 00:51:48,239
vehicle on the way to where i was going

1478
00:51:46,719 --> 00:51:50,639
uh

1479
00:51:48,239 --> 00:51:52,159
you are a very patient person it wasn't

1480
00:51:50,639 --> 00:51:54,639
bad

1481
00:51:52,159 --> 00:51:56,318
bad i leaned over i wasn't like on my

1482
00:51:54,639 --> 00:51:57,679
hands and you know it was just a regular

1483
00:51:56,318 --> 00:51:59,440
nap at that point

1484
00:51:57,679 --> 00:52:00,960
i think the bike helmet would like mess

1485
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:03,039
with my neck that's the only way i

1486
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:04,720
hesitate like i'm so specific on how my

1487
00:52:03,039 --> 00:52:06,318
pillow has to go behind my head when i

1488
00:52:04,719 --> 00:52:08,318
go to sleep at night for me to like fall

1489
00:52:06,318 --> 00:52:09,759
asleep but i can only imagine having

1490
00:52:08,318 --> 00:52:12,318
this [ __ ] thing on the top of my head

1491
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:14,079
where i'm like yeah no yeah like you

1492
00:52:12,318 --> 00:52:15,759
drop or do stuff that's got to support

1493
00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:17,920
the pillow the pillow didn't now it goes

1494
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:19,280
to the neck and now yeah right but like

1495
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:20,800
trying to get that right just sounds

1496
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:22,960
frustrating you move you're gonna wake

1497
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:24,079
up with a headache oh for sure sure

1498
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:25,760
gonna wake up with a headache you know

1499
00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:26,800
if you wake up with it you don't wake up

1500
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:28,480
with a headache when you sleep in the

1501
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:30,880
handcuffs maybe your fingers hurt a

1502
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:34,400
little bit i still teasing bike element

1503
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:37,039
okay so when you guys had me on your

1504
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:39,519
podcast the other day which is great

1505
00:52:37,039 --> 00:52:41,599
saying i i loved some of your episodes

1506
00:52:39,519 --> 00:52:43,679
that that phenotype episode is the first

1507
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:47,280
one that pops out to me as it was the

1508
00:52:43,679 --> 00:52:49,039
most recent one i listened to um

1509
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:51,760
but

1510
00:52:49,039 --> 00:52:53,358
it cracked me up how far out you guys

1511
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:55,040
could go out there and i appreciate you

1512
00:52:53,358 --> 00:52:56,639
guys coming on my show and doing this

1513
00:52:55,039 --> 00:52:58,800
with me because we've done the exact

1514
00:52:56,639 --> 00:53:01,118
same thing we get to talk cannabis we

1515
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:02,880
get to have fun but we also get to throw

1516
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:05,200
some [ __ ] out there so i want to talk

1517
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:07,599
about that episode specifically

1518
00:53:05,199 --> 00:53:09,439
good towards the end

1519
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:10,800
you guys start getting into aliens and

1520
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:12,318
[ __ ] like that

1521
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:14,800
tell ya what

1522
00:53:12,318 --> 00:53:17,358
what do you each believe oh is there

1523
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:18,400
life out there oh well it's for sure

1524
00:53:17,358 --> 00:53:20,639
thousand

1525
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:23,039
one thousand percent

1526
00:53:20,639 --> 00:53:24,558
and i i will talk about any i will tell

1527
00:53:23,039 --> 00:53:26,480
people i'm like

1528
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:29,359
right now with the technology we have

1529
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:31,519
you can't even kind of say no right like

1530
00:53:29,358 --> 00:53:33,358
you can live in your hole and hide under

1531
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:35,119
your rock if you want to

1532
00:53:33,358 --> 00:53:36,239
there's just so much evidence out there

1533
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:38,720
and

1534
00:53:36,239 --> 00:53:40,799
[ __ ] dude like i i don't know about you

1535
00:53:38,719 --> 00:53:42,719
but it's not that hard to go see a

1536
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:44,800
[ __ ] experience like

1537
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:48,078
you know like i think everyone's gotta

1538
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:49,599
like i've seen that or you know

1539
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:51,519
yeah that's

1540
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:53,200
what about you gary yeah dude there's

1541
00:53:51,519 --> 00:53:54,800
just absolutely

1542
00:53:53,199 --> 00:53:56,318
yeah of course there's [ __ ] out there

1543
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:58,800
it's like they tell us like i don't i

1544
00:53:56,318 --> 00:54:00,558
don't know specific numbers but there's

1545
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:02,720
hundreds of thousands of i don't know

1546
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:04,240
how many galaxies right like galaxies

1547
00:54:02,719 --> 00:54:06,318
and we're in the milky way right which

1548
00:54:04,239 --> 00:54:11,000
is comprised of many different

1549
00:54:06,318 --> 00:54:11,000
uh you know solar solar systems

1550
00:54:23,519 --> 00:54:28,559
there's no way it's just empty for just

1551
00:54:26,318 --> 00:54:30,159
no reason right and even like bacteria

1552
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:31,599
on another planet would count as an

1553
00:54:30,159 --> 00:54:33,440
alien right because it's just life on

1554
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:35,280
another planet exactly like

1555
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:37,280
even at that level like you gotta

1556
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:38,880
believe that at some point right there

1557
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:40,880
it could be something right and then

1558
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:42,640
they tell us there's earth-like planets

1559
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:44,559
out there it's like well then

1560
00:54:42,639 --> 00:54:47,759
yeah i saw this statistic that was like

1561
00:54:44,559 --> 00:54:50,160
just in our like galaxy hubble telescope

1562
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:52,960
alone has already yeah noticed quite a

1563
00:54:50,159 --> 00:54:55,199
few planets that have potentially have

1564
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:57,440
water which is the basis of life and

1565
00:54:55,199 --> 00:54:58,960
that's the way that i see about it is if

1566
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:00,318
we already perceive this and we know

1567
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:02,559
that there's a few planets out there

1568
00:55:00,318 --> 00:55:04,480
that could potentially have life within

1569
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:06,720
the vision of the entire universe that

1570
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:08,719
we can see which is way beyond our reach

1571
00:55:06,719 --> 00:55:10,078
which is like this much right i forgot

1572
00:55:08,719 --> 00:55:12,078
what they named it but there's a brand

1573
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:14,798
new telescope that's even more powerful

1574
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:16,318
than the hubble was i've been seeing

1575
00:55:14,798 --> 00:55:18,159
it's pretty cool

1576
00:55:16,318 --> 00:55:20,480
but they're getting way better pictures

1577
00:55:18,159 --> 00:55:22,639
within just imagine if we find even more

1578
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:24,960
of these you exactly like you said if

1579
00:55:22,639 --> 00:55:27,920
there's not like a [ __ ] amoeba or a

1580
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:30,079
protozoa on that is that not an alien

1581
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:33,039
right like so at some level like we win

1582
00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:35,119
like there's aliens and i'm a safe bet

1583
00:55:33,039 --> 00:55:37,519
that is a safe you could put your money

1584
00:55:35,119 --> 00:55:39,680
there and be all right yeah we're not

1585
00:55:37,519 --> 00:55:41,679
talking the aliens in the movies no like

1586
00:55:39,679 --> 00:55:43,279
no literally though

1587
00:55:41,679 --> 00:55:46,159
like if you guys if you're trying to ask

1588
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:48,720
me like how i really feel yes like

1589
00:55:46,159 --> 00:55:50,798
yes everything everything everything

1590
00:55:48,719 --> 00:55:53,199
that you've been

1591
00:55:50,798 --> 00:55:55,679
riddle me this why have so many alien

1592
00:55:53,199 --> 00:55:57,118
things come out like in that as of late

1593
00:55:55,679 --> 00:55:58,480
and like that now it's like second

1594
00:55:57,119 --> 00:56:00,880
nature now shit's coming from a

1595
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:03,358
different planet superheroes whatever

1596
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:05,680
like it's it's just okay it's accepted

1597
00:56:03,358 --> 00:56:06,639
dude like i feel like that's like slow

1598
00:56:05,679 --> 00:56:09,118
roll

1599
00:56:06,639 --> 00:56:11,118
like desensitization so that when they

1600
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:12,640
tell you there's aliens it doesn't melt

1601
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:14,400
your brain out of your face right like

1602
00:56:12,639 --> 00:56:15,598
you don't just go into a panic and start

1603
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:17,440
lighting your pants people think we've

1604
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:18,960
already been visited

1605
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:21,599
oh yeah

1606
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:23,440
yes yeah i agree like

1607
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:26,000
ain't no way dude bro i just watched

1608
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:29,280
this like an hour long documentary on

1609
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:31,838
mummies in the grand canyon

1610
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:33,119
and i i'm convinced well there's like a

1611
00:56:31,838 --> 00:56:35,679
sphinx or something they uncover no

1612
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:37,519
there's so much it's like i'm not going

1613
00:56:35,679 --> 00:56:40,719
to go into it because it's so long but

1614
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:44,239
like i need to look this up

1615
00:56:40,719 --> 00:56:46,239
yeah was it a credible source

1616
00:56:44,239 --> 00:56:48,159
there's multiple different videos on

1617
00:56:46,239 --> 00:56:50,639
this and the credible source is this

1618
00:56:48,159 --> 00:56:53,358
place exists and there was these things

1619
00:56:50,639 --> 00:56:55,358
found there what the source is that's

1620
00:56:53,358 --> 00:56:57,199
the debatable but the one guy i watched

1621
00:56:55,358 --> 00:56:58,798
was very convincing and already kind of

1622
00:56:57,199 --> 00:57:00,399
like was explaining things along the

1623
00:56:58,798 --> 00:57:03,039
lines that like

1624
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:05,039
i'm making sense of aliens in my head

1625
00:57:03,039 --> 00:57:07,358
right so i'm like oh okay this could be

1626
00:57:05,039 --> 00:57:09,519
some more some of that [ __ ] right

1627
00:57:07,358 --> 00:57:11,279
and uh you know

1628
00:57:09,519 --> 00:57:14,480
i'll i'll give you the link after this

1629
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:16,319
but yeah you get into it and

1630
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:18,480
there's gotta be right like also like

1631
00:57:16,318 --> 00:57:20,639
why does the pyramid

1632
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:22,318
look like the one in

1633
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:24,000
the aztecs app like why does the egypt

1634
00:57:22,318 --> 00:57:26,000
one and the aztec one look the same

1635
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,599
they've never seen their other

1636
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:29,358
they're not homies

1637
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:31,200
right they're not kicking it they're not

1638
00:57:29,358 --> 00:57:32,400
taking boats over they didn't consult

1639
00:57:31,199 --> 00:57:36,000
and be like hey this is really good

1640
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:37,599
shape you should do that winston like

1641
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:39,679
they were blessed

1642
00:57:37,599 --> 00:57:41,838
with [ __ ] that we can't even understand

1643
00:57:39,679 --> 00:57:43,199
how they made it to this day exactly

1644
00:57:41,838 --> 00:57:47,279
we're like i

1645
00:57:43,199 --> 00:57:47,279
need i don't know maybe mammoths

1646
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:52,559
just peruvian temples alone seeing some

1647
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:54,400
of the structures of how they put those

1648
00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:56,480
blocks together where it's almost like a

1649
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:57,920
puzzle piece it's not simple

1650
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:59,679
you know

1651
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:02,240
yeah holy hell

1652
00:57:59,679 --> 00:58:04,399
but those ones are like on like peaks of

1653
00:58:02,239 --> 00:58:06,798
like these cliffs because i like how

1654
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:08,480
crazy the rain comes down there's like

1655
00:58:06,798 --> 00:58:10,239
so much erosion that there's only so

1656
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:12,079
many spots you can build and everything

1657
00:58:10,239 --> 00:58:13,679
else around it's a [ __ ] valley like

1658
00:58:12,079 --> 00:58:15,280
in a river right like there's just

1659
00:58:13,679 --> 00:58:18,078
rivers everywhere so

1660
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:21,680
like yeah to move all these rocks

1661
00:58:18,079 --> 00:58:22,559
with like you got canoes

1662
00:58:21,679 --> 00:58:24,719
and

1663
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:26,720
you i don't even think they had horses

1664
00:58:24,719 --> 00:58:27,838
like i don't even think that aztecs had

1665
00:58:26,719 --> 00:58:28,558
like

1666
00:58:27,838 --> 00:58:30,558
like

1667
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:33,040
first like beasts of burden like i don't

1668
00:58:30,559 --> 00:58:35,040
i don't know on that one yeah like i

1669
00:58:33,039 --> 00:58:36,960
can't think of like i'm very obsessed

1670
00:58:35,039 --> 00:58:39,199
with egyptian culture but i don't know

1671
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:41,599
very much about peruvian yeah right so

1672
00:58:39,199 --> 00:58:43,838
i'm like did they even have animals that

1673
00:58:41,599 --> 00:58:46,400
could pull that [ __ ] like

1674
00:58:43,838 --> 00:58:48,000
maybe an ox or like an alpaca but like

1675
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:49,280
how many alpacas would it take to move

1676
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,530
one of them [ __ ]

1677
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:53,119
stones dude

1678
00:58:50,530 --> 00:58:56,480
[Laughter]

1679
00:58:53,119 --> 00:58:58,960
some beasted alpaca

1680
00:58:56,480 --> 00:59:02,280
ripped like look like small horses with

1681
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:02,280
long necks

1682
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:09,839
yeah dude there's no way even that we're

1683
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:11,920
the most advanced right like that's

1684
00:59:09,838 --> 00:59:13,440
not even close if everything's infinite

1685
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:15,519
dude like there's you just got to

1686
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:17,200
believe that everything is everywhere

1687
00:59:15,519 --> 00:59:20,079
like technology wise we're on a very

1688
00:59:17,199 --> 00:59:22,159
slow roll until very recently too like

1689
00:59:20,079 --> 00:59:25,039
something to think about

1690
00:59:22,159 --> 00:59:26,879
what's the best wi-fi password name that

1691
00:59:25,039 --> 00:59:30,719
you've ever seen

1692
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:33,680
steamer hat password or or like

1693
00:59:30,719 --> 00:59:34,959
the wi-fi name oh

1694
00:59:33,679 --> 00:59:36,639
i don't know like

1695
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:38,720
this is kind of an old meme but like i

1696
00:59:36,639 --> 00:59:41,519
like the like police fan

1697
00:59:38,719 --> 00:59:41,519
uh ones

1698
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:45,599
those were pretty funny uh when when

1699
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:46,400
people i think that kind of started this

1700
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:48,079
whole

1701
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:51,920
revolution of

1702
00:59:48,079 --> 00:59:54,318
like the antithesis of i like that one

1703
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:56,639
i saw like get your own [ __ ] wi-fi

1704
00:59:54,318 --> 00:59:57,920
like i forget the name of the guy but it

1705
00:59:56,639 --> 01:00:00,798
was like

1706
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:02,159
directly pointed i assumed like a

1707
01:00:00,798 --> 01:00:03,759
roommate

1708
01:00:02,159 --> 01:00:05,279
but

1709
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:06,960
it could have been a [ __ ] neighbor it

1710
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:08,319
could have been like hey dude get your

1711
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:10,480
own [ __ ] like get off my [ __ ] there's

1712
01:00:08,318 --> 01:00:12,480
apartments and i was like what who would

1713
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:14,079
there be just putting them on blast

1714
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:15,679
every time i try to sign into something

1715
01:00:14,079 --> 01:00:17,839
i see this right like just everyone

1716
01:00:15,679 --> 01:00:19,598
knows it was it was very easy such a

1717
01:00:17,838 --> 01:00:22,000
disservice if you don't change your

1718
01:00:19,599 --> 01:00:23,599
wi-fi name just something incredible

1719
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:25,920
i like to [ __ ] with my neighbor so i

1720
01:00:23,599 --> 01:00:27,680
named my wi-fi after him

1721
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:30,240
with his name drawn out in an

1722
01:00:27,679 --> 01:00:32,078
exclamation point at the end

1723
01:00:30,239 --> 01:00:33,838
so every time he gets on it says his

1724
01:00:32,079 --> 01:00:36,079
name

1725
01:00:33,838 --> 01:00:37,358

best yeah yeah do you guys ever do like

1754
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:32,480
live shows or anything

1755
01:01:30,719 --> 01:01:34,480
it's things we're thinking about right

1756
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:37,119
like to the future we want to make sure

1757
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:39,199
i mean so we did like a live 420

1758
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:42,079
giveaway thing for like an hour or like

1759
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:44,239
45 minutes or something maybe

1760
01:01:42,079 --> 01:01:46,480
that but like

1761
01:01:44,239 --> 01:01:49,118
bahaki came on and he's our homie right

1762
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:51,519
he's been on a couple episodes and

1763
01:01:49,119 --> 01:01:53,358
he's our very first ever patron very

1764
01:01:51,519 --> 01:01:55,280
first ever patron like we like this guy

1765
01:01:53,358 --> 01:01:56,880
a lot and he he came and kicked it with

1766
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:59,119
us but like nobody else jumped in or

1767
01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:00,720
asked questions and i was like man i was

1768
01:01:59,119 --> 01:02:02,960
really expecting this to pop off so i

1769
01:02:00,719 --> 01:02:05,439
think i would do a live show when we

1770
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:07,599
were like maybe double digit k and

1771
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:09,519
followers or like you know like

1772
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:11,200
that was just instagram live too i think

1773
01:02:09,519 --> 01:02:12,719
that there's merit for going on to like

1774
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:13,919
something like twitch and doing a show

1775
01:02:12,719 --> 01:02:16,239
like that and

1776
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:17,599
potential to have a bigger audience um

1777
01:02:16,239 --> 01:02:19,279
that was just kind of like a thrown

1778
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:20,960
together thing it was

1779
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:23,119
it wasn't really

1780
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:24,318
super well thought out i would say no

1781
01:02:23,119 --> 01:02:27,039
not at all

1782
01:02:24,318 --> 01:02:28,480
so but there's definitely

1783
01:02:27,039 --> 01:02:30,559
eventually going to have some live shows

1784
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:32,000
whether that be just for patrons or not

1785
01:02:30,559 --> 01:02:34,240
um we're still kind of toying with the

1786
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:36,000
idea of that uh because we like to give

1787
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:38,000
back to the homies in there who like to

1788
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:39,199
support us so

1789
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,798
yeah

1790
01:02:39,199 --> 01:02:42,639
for your following and the people that

1791
01:02:40,798 --> 01:02:45,358
follow you are really ultimately going

1792
01:02:42,639 --> 01:02:47,199
to be the people that truly support you

1793
01:02:45,358 --> 01:02:48,480
want to see you doing better and push

1794
01:02:47,199 --> 01:02:50,558
you to be better

1795
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:53,920
yeah i'm telling you guys it is so much

1796
01:02:50,559 --> 01:02:55,440
better going slow and building up your

1797
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:57,119
community with those people that you

1798
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:58,639
really vibe with because in the end

1799
01:02:57,119 --> 01:03:01,519
you're going to be a lot happier than

1800
01:02:58,639 --> 01:03:02,400
having you know 10 i've seen a million

1801
01:03:01,519 --> 01:03:04,960
videos

1802
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:06,798
uh from creator friends of mine

1803
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:09,119
that said the worst thing that ever

1804
01:03:06,798 --> 01:03:10,960
happened to me was a video going viral

1805
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:12,960
well why is that because if your video

1806
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:14,400
goes viral everybody knows you for that

1807
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:16,159
one video and they're all following you

1808
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:18,240
but it's not people that are interested

1809
01:03:16,159 --> 01:03:20,798
in you they just like that video

1810
01:03:18,239 --> 01:03:23,038
right one thing not all of your content

1811
01:03:20,798 --> 01:03:24,960
yeah you get this huge influx and

1812
01:03:23,039 --> 01:03:26,559
followers and then they're not liking

1813
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:28,880
your content they're not sharing they

1814
01:03:26,559 --> 01:03:30,319
don't give a [ __ ] so you're ultimately

1815
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:31,920
doing yourself a disservice because a

1816
01:03:30,318 --> 01:03:34,558
bunch of people are leaning to seeing

1817
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:37,200
your stuff and yeah whatever i like to

1818
01:03:34,559 --> 01:03:38,480
call them uh nameless numbers you never

1819
01:03:37,199 --> 01:03:40,798
get to know their name but they're just

1820
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:42,240
a number exactly so it's really

1821
01:03:40,798 --> 01:03:44,159
important to get those people that you

1822
01:03:42,239 --> 01:03:45,598
know you're vibing with and that you

1823
01:03:44,159 --> 01:03:47,679
have that and you guys are [ __ ]

1824
01:03:45,599 --> 01:03:48,960
awesome i can already tell i'm gonna get

1825
01:03:47,679 --> 01:03:50,399

you can come over here whatever but yeah

1832
01:04:00,239 --> 01:04:02,798
like there's no reason we have another

1833
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:04,720
microphone right we have another

1834
01:04:02,798 --> 01:04:06,639
microphone we can bring all three of

1835
01:04:04,719 --> 01:04:08,399
them like it don't matter yeah

1836
01:04:06,639 --> 01:04:11,118
right on man so you guys are you

1837
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:13,838
monetizing on uh patreon at all

1838
01:04:11,119 --> 01:04:15,680
yeah yeah a little bit we have like what

1839
01:04:13,838 --> 01:04:18,798
our five dollar slots

1840
01:04:15,679 --> 01:04:21,038
uh that used to be three like we're not

1841
01:04:18,798 --> 01:04:23,038
yeah we did we did we had a few packs

1842
01:04:21,039 --> 01:04:25,280
from our homie pinoy poi we did an

1843
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:27,599
episode with him um he sent over a big

1844
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:29,760
old care package uh one each for me and

1845
01:04:27,599 --> 01:04:31,920
josh and then some extras just to do

1846
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:33,520
whatever we wanted to do with giveaway

1847
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:36,240
anything like that so we decided that we

1848
01:04:33,519 --> 01:04:38,400
would put it on for our patreon

1849
01:04:36,239 --> 01:04:40,000
you know as like an incentive to you get

1850
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:41,920
some like legendary seats for three

1851
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,798
dollars so it was just a no-brainer it's

1852
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:44,480
like

1853
01:04:42,798 --> 01:04:45,599
um incentive

1854
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:48,079
and

1855
01:04:45,599 --> 01:04:50,160
then uh 420 rolled around and we had

1856
01:04:48,079 --> 01:04:52,000
some we hadn't met our we had 10 packs

1857
01:04:50,159 --> 01:04:54,000
to give away we got to about seven so we

1858
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:56,159
had three left to give away so we did

1859
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:58,079
that on 420 it was just kind of like a

1860
01:04:56,159 --> 01:04:59,838
blessing the people kind of thing

1861
01:04:58,079 --> 01:05:02,559
and um

1862
01:04:59,838 --> 01:05:03,759
so then we just moved our tier to

1863
01:05:02,559 --> 01:05:06,720
uh

1864
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:08,880
tier to tier two which we still have uh

1865
01:05:06,719 --> 01:05:10,719
free seeds on there too

1866
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:13,119
some sweet tea seeds

1867
01:05:10,719 --> 01:05:14,719
from we got a pack of sub cool we got a

1868
01:05:13,119 --> 01:05:16,798
couple miles out of it we did ourselves

1869
01:05:14,719 --> 01:05:18,159
a breeding project with those

1870
01:05:16,798 --> 01:05:19,759
and they have

1871
01:05:18,159 --> 01:05:21,679
a decent amount of variability in there

1872
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:22,880
but there's still like a pretty

1873
01:05:21,679 --> 01:05:24,960
pretty

1874
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:26,079
small gap of different phenotypes that

1875
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:27,280
you can get out of there and there's

1876
01:05:26,079 --> 01:05:29,519
been a couple people who have ran them

1877
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:32,319
here and there as well um

1878
01:05:29,519 --> 01:05:33,358
if you wanted to i haven't grown any

1879
01:05:32,318 --> 01:05:34,159
myself

1880
01:05:33,358 --> 01:05:35,679
so

1881
01:05:34,159 --> 01:05:37,598
um i just kind of gave them out to some

1882
01:05:35,679 --> 01:05:39,919
people and they grew them so but that's

1883
01:05:37,599 --> 01:05:41,838
on our on our tier now and then we also

1884
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:42,880
produce some extra content on our

1885
01:05:41,838 --> 01:05:44,078
patreon

1886
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:46,480
um

1887
01:05:44,079 --> 01:05:48,960
just for like the uh we go over very

1888
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:50,798
