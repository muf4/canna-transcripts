40
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:58,879
Growers over here um anybody that's not

41
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,718
familiar with spice alive do you want to

42
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:03,118
give us a little background about how

43
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:04,919
you got started growing and how that

44
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:08,598
became spice of Life

45
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:11,520
Seeds sure when I started growing my own

46
00:02:08,598 --> 00:02:15,560
um really the like

47
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:18,239
8990 there was no easy access to clones

48
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:20,519
or seeds for the average person you had

49
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,400
to you know Network a little bit to find

50
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:26,120
some you couldn't just go to a shop or

51
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:29,480
go on the internet and order them right

52
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:31,319
and it was imperative that if you found

53
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:33,878
something you like that you started to

54
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:37,439
save some seed of it you know so we just

55
00:02:33,878 --> 00:02:41,039
got in as a hobbyist out of necessity

56
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:42,680
saving seed and and trying to cross this

57
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:44,759
and that we would just do you know a

58
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:46,840
branch in the bottom here and there so

59
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:50,359
you had like a film canister of seed

60
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:55,400
which was what we used back in the day

61
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:59,440
and when I moved to Vancouver after

62
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:03,360
University um Mark enry was there from

63
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:05,280
also Al from London and he'd I remember

64
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,040
his City Lights Bookstore and that cuz

65
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,360
he was the first one selling High Times

66
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:12,120
or true life two life crew and that was

67
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,680
prohibited you know so you know I was

68
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:17,080
always aware of the dude but I didn't

69
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:20,840
know him or anything but he had HBC he'

70
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:22,640
got busted selling seeds and he was the

71
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:24,680
only guy selling seeds and I thought it

72
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:26,318
was you know hey if this guy wants to

73
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,959
keep selling seeds I should donate him

74
00:03:26,318 --> 00:03:29,798
some seeds so I went down and I took a

75
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:32,519
film canister of seeds and just said

76
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:33,959
said I know you got busted selling seeds

77
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:36,560
if you're going to keep doing it I just

78
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:38,360
wanted to donate a jar to you and he's

79
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,799
like well what are they you got pictures

80
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:42,200
descriptions anything I said no nothing

81
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,040
just see what people think you know and

82
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:48,839
then I was in there a few months later

83
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:51,158
and picking up a magazine or papers or

84
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:53,280
something like that and he and he said

85
00:03:51,158 --> 00:03:55,359
hey you gave me those seeds people

86
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,959
really like them make as many as you can

87
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,480
keep bringing me seeds you know so I was

88
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:02,799
like oh

89
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:04,598
hm you could actually do that as a

90
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,239
business because I was purely a hobbyist

91
00:04:04,598 --> 00:04:09,078
you know I just figured I'd work in

92
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,878
other thing and just be a a hobbyist

93
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:12,599
forever and and one of the reasons I

94
00:04:10,878 --> 00:04:15,479
moved to Vancouver it was the only place

95
00:04:12,598 --> 00:04:17,560
in Canada nobody was in jail for growing

96
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:19,719
even personal you know so it was the

97
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:22,240
safe place to grow and as such all the

98
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:25,360
Growers were there as very International

99
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:27,400
city as well so there was uh a real you

100
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,360
know Melting Pot of seeds pouring in

101
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:32,120
there there was you know seed from all

102
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:35,680
over the world you get Indian seed

103
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:37,360
Southeast Asian seed you know the West

104
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,120
all the West Coast stuff you know

105
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:43,120
California and Oregon and there's just

106
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:45,800
so just so much to choose from so while

107
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,759
I got there I just made a point out of

108
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:50,120
collecting any cutting anybody was

109
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:52,038
selling or trying any seeds friends G

110
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,639
gave me you know and have lots of

111
00:04:52,038 --> 00:04:55,959
friends from around the world that live

112
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:58,840
there and it was so fun you know that I

113
00:04:55,959 --> 00:05:01,279
was just constantly playing with them I

114
00:04:58,839 --> 00:05:03,638
wasn't worried about cranking out big

115
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:05,239
pounds or anything I just love to start

116
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:07,519
a lot of seeds and look at all the

117
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:09,560
different plants and then pack a whack a

118
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:12,319
different jars you know just have lots

119
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:15,199
and just be able to share it and enjoy

120
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:16,800
it and it was a hoop and then of course

121
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,240
you know most people were more into

122
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,840
growing pounds of weed so of course when

123
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:23,280
you found something really nice you made

124
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:25,159
sure to get man I would love to see this

125
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:27,399
weed everywhere so I want these cuting

126
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:29,039
out there like that sweet Scout cutting

127
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:31,279
and you pass them around to get

128
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:34,240
everybody growing it so you'd see more

129
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:36,519
of it in the world you know so it was

130
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,240
great fun like I would give it to I

131
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:39,599
never even was swinging it to people I

132
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,280
was just sharing with people and just

133
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,879
saying if you really like this weed you

134
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:45,918
want to grow it you know it takes 12

135
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:48,240
weeks to flower it's not your standard

136
00:05:45,918 --> 00:05:51,079
BC big butt or whatever but it just

137
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,879
tastes heavily so I say I'll give it to

138
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:54,478
you for free but just promise me you're

139
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:56,600
going to give it to anybody else that

140
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:58,879
wants it for free too and just get it

141
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:01,199
out there you know so it's friendly

142
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:04,079
wildfires some of these Cuts like that

143
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:06,680
and the ones that I had that were like

144
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:09,079
super interesting for one reason or

145
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:10,918
another like a sterile plant where I

146
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:12,959
thought oh my God I should hang on to

147
00:06:10,918 --> 00:06:15,478
this until you know you can do something

148
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:17,239
with it officially and I wouldn't share

149
00:06:15,478 --> 00:06:19,399
them and then I would lose them so the

150
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:21,598
ones that I thought were too special to

151
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:23,598
share which didn't last very long

152
00:06:21,598 --> 00:06:26,159
because I I learned my lesson quickly

153
00:06:23,598 --> 00:06:29,719
like if you put it out there it's never

154
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:31,520
lost you know if if stand if it's stands

155
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:34,280
on its own you know if it stands on its

156
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:36,399
tone you'll still find it 25 years later

157
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:38,318
but if it's not worth keeping it'll be

158
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:40,758
gone but if you try and keep it in too

159
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:43,080
small a circle or just by yourself it's

160
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:46,560
too easy to lose a really Beauty cutting

161
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:49,159
that way you know I wanted to ask you

162
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,360
those seeds that you gave to Mark Emory

163
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:53,759
those first seeds that you gave to him

164
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:58,160
do you have any recollection of what

165
00:06:53,759 --> 00:07:00,319
those were yeah of course they were uh

166
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,240
something I brought with me I called

167
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:05,560
Medway Madness for the creek outside

168
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:08,960
London Ontario or in London Ontario

169
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:11,280
where I yeah so that was it was my

170
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:12,758
Medway Madness but I rebranded it out

171
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:14,878
there because I said nobody's going to

172
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:18,319
know what the hell Medway Madness is so

173
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:20,520
I called it Jolly Rancher because it was

174
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:24,199
kind of sweet and tangy like that you

175
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:26,519
know and just seemed like a happy name

176
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:28,120
for the Jolly Rancher so that was kind

177
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:30,279
of fun and that was the first one but I

178
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:32,560
remember when he opened the

179
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:34,478
that it was they were really really big

180
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,038
seeds so you didn't get as many in a

181
00:07:34,478 --> 00:07:38,758
canister as if you had really small

182
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:40,399
seeds of course so you open them up and

183
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:41,879
the big he pulls it out and he says

184
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:44,719
they're freaking

185
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:46,479
coconuts I still remember he's like

186
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,319
they're freaking coconuts but they were

187
00:07:46,478 --> 00:07:49,719
they were like small peas they were

188
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:52,158
really big

189
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:53,800
seeds yeah especially when you said a

190
00:07:52,158 --> 00:07:55,800
lot of the stuff that was coming around

191
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:58,439
right then was mostly land race heirloom

192
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:01,240
type stuff uh a lot of those carry small

193
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:04,560
seed at least in my experience but I've

194
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:06,280
mostly worked with Asians and pacifics

195
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,319
and those I haven't done very much as

196
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:10,559
South Americans or Mexicans like you

197
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,520
have that's pretty damn there's a lot of

198
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,280
a lot of small seeds in the tropical

199
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:17,478
seed but there is some big ones too like

200
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:20,519
for hemp ones a really fat one is like

201
00:08:17,478 --> 00:08:21,439
the tropical hemp Yan the Chinese one

202
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:24,799
those

203
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:27,120
are big big

204
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,478
beans but you know as a breeder if

205
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,079
you're selling them buy the Seed you're

206
00:08:29,478 --> 00:08:33,559
happy with small ones because you

207
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:36,679
harvest them by the weight you know so

208
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:38,278
if you harvest 10 kilos of seed you know

209
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:39,958
you've got twice as many if they're

210
00:08:38,278 --> 00:08:43,000
small than if they're

211
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:45,599
big yeah very very true I mean I've seen

212
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,080
some Indians that are damn near like the

213
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,040
end of a pin you know just tiny little

214
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,440
black

215
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:52,399
Opals tiny dots they're almost like

216
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,959
poppy

217
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:58,839
seeds so then you follow up the Medway

218
00:08:55,958 --> 00:09:01,399
Madness with the sweet pink grapefruit

219
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:03,800
and a lot of people don't know this um

220
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:06,039
but you do not claim creation to the

221
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:08,759
Sweet paint grapefruit at all right I

222
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:11,319
named it I didn't make it though it's

223
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:13,078
just a clone I collected and the Clone

224
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:15,680
was I said what do they call it they

225
00:09:13,078 --> 00:09:19,078
said he says The Only Thing Worth

226
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:21,439
growing he this is just the Only Thing

227
00:09:19,078 --> 00:09:25,479
Worth growing that was the that was the

228
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:28,399
deal right so I said okay and I I could

229
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:30,839
tell that it was a sweet herb but it was

230
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:33,958
always cut too early for my taste so it

231
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:36,480
was kind of had a lot of orange hair and

232
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:38,958
it just it was underdeveloped small CX

233
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,240
you know and I was like I bet you this

234
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:44,000
would be nice if you got it finished and

235
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:47,039
had it plump up you know and and I

236
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,759
really was wanting to try it um and so

237
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:51,199
the girl I knew who was selling eights

238
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:53,319
of it she was like the exclusive seller

239
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:56,800
of this guy she was kind of a friend of

240
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:58,640
a friend and she'd uh she said oh yeah

241
00:09:56,799 --> 00:10:01,319
he'll sell you a tray of clones minimum

242
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:03,120
orders 20 clones for five bucks each or

243
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:04,920
whatever I said that's fine so that's

244
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,759
what I was doing you know when I first

245
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:10,000
moved there just sit in my apartment and

246
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:11,759
send you know anybody that knew somebody

247
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,159
selling clones and there was always lots

248
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:16,200
of people because we go down to wreck

249
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:17,879
Beach and places like that like there

250
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,680
every day you could go out and find for

251
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:22,240
new people to sell you some clothes you

252
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:24,719
know it was easy Vancouver is just a a

253
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:28,000
hot bed at the time and it still is I'm

254
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:30,160
sure and uh anyways it was just so fun

255
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,078
to collect them and you just just throw

256
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:35,439
you know tag a couple keep as many moms

257
00:10:33,078 --> 00:10:37,679
in the collection and then flower out a

258
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,440
couple see if they're worth keeping get

259
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:42,078
rid of the ones you don't like and just

260
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:44,200
keep doing that right and then before

261
00:10:42,078 --> 00:10:46,319
you know it you say oh these are my six

262
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:49,160
favorite plants from the last year or

263
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:51,440
whatever you know and the and I you know

264
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:52,958
you can poping seeds on the side too but

265
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,200
it's nice to collect the Clones that are

266
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:58,119
going around town and then just see who

267
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,720
grows it better you know and uh then

268
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:01,720
it's like a one design race when

269
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:05,240
everybody's growing that same thing you

270
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:07,600
know the uh but when I first flowered

271
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:10,159
that out was on my balcony in my first

272
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:13,360
apartment in Kitano that was on Broadway

273
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:15,480
and U and we were just on second floor

274
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:18,079
but I had a really you know spacious

275
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:20,440
balcony there and people from taller

276
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:22,519
Towers across and people on the bus and

277
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:25,360
stuff would go by wave cuz I had this

278
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:29,720
balcony covered in weed and even on the

279
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:32,399
railing I had 21 gallon pots with 20

280
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:35,320
grapefruits you know I maybe 19 I think

281
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:37,320
I kept one in as a mom in the closet and

282
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:40,160
then then these ones that were The Only

283
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:42,480
Thing Worth growing just spread along

284
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:44,240
the rail of the balcony and just all

285
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:48,320
growing into plump little things you

286
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:50,680
know and uh maybe 1 o plants or

287
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:53,399
something but chunky little things and

288
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:57,679
uh I would ask people because I'd let it

289
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:59,360
go it was smelling super super sweet

290
00:11:57,679 --> 00:12:01,039
pink grapefruit there was no no other

291
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,440
way it was I just said this like a ruby

292
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:06,159
red that you just covered in white sugar

293
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:08,440
it was just like that and it I would say

294
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:10,360
nothing people would come over and I had

295
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:13,000
like you know 20 different plants on the

296
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:14,440
balcony not counting those and tomatoes

297
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,799
and stuff and the first people would

298
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:19,079
come out and see tomato and then they

299
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:21,479
kind of realize holy [ __ ] this is all we

300
00:12:19,078 --> 00:12:23,399
you know and then I would say smell

301
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:26,879
those ones on the railing tell me what

302
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:30,440
they smell like and 20 out of 20 people

303
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:32,480
went sweet pink great you know everybody

304
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:36,440
said it so it was just to me I was like

305
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:38,879
Wow SPG a fresh label on that thing SPG

306
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:41,839
sweeping grapefruit CU it didn't have a

307
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:44,559
name there so it needed it that was

308
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:48,199
that's what I thought anyways I think

309
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:51,559
the what I've heard various lore and

310
00:12:48,198 --> 00:12:56,719
legends of it that it was like 17 years

311
00:12:51,559 --> 00:13:00,359
on the islands after being 17 years out

312
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:02,000
of the US or or grown in Washington and

313
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:05,680
that it was some early Northern

314
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:08,039
lightline which is entirely plausible I

315
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:10,919
I mean I have no way of knowing for

316
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:12,759
absolute dead certainty but I think

317
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:15,078
through the sequencing and everything

318
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:18,240
that they've pretty much determined it

319
00:13:15,078 --> 00:13:21,879
was a an early Northern lightline and it

320
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:23,759
had been so it was a pleasant smoke or

321
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:26,159
is a pleasant smoke and that it doesn't

322
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:28,439
put the hurt on people it's nice at a

323
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:31,000
party because it it lights up a party

324
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:33,360
and people are social and happy where

325
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,198
and chatty whereas you know you can

326
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,919
break out something heavier and then

327
00:13:35,198 --> 00:13:37,919
everybody's

328
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:43,000
just just kind of stupified you know

329
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,279
sometimes it's nice to have that life

330
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,278
Pleasant herb that you know it's maybe

331
00:13:45,278 --> 00:13:50,679
20% THC not super strong I think they

332
00:13:48,278 --> 00:13:53,198
probably when I've seen it tested from

333
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:56,719
different people's tests was anywhere

334
00:13:53,198 --> 00:14:00,078
from you know 17 to 22 or something like

335
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:03,278
that so I'd say the average 19 18 20 21

336
00:14:00,078 --> 00:14:05,078
is probably the most common for it and

337
00:14:03,278 --> 00:14:08,000
it's possible to get it a little

338
00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:10,078
stronger too I think but the uh the

339
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:14,399
strongest batches I don't you know never

340
00:14:10,078 --> 00:14:18,399
had them tested the um but is a nice

341
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:20,240
happy H and it's a I think I almost want

342
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:22,360
to make like red hats with the white

343
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:25,159
letters that say make cannabis sweet

344
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:27,639
again because I don't see so much of the

345
00:14:25,159 --> 00:14:30,799
candied flavors there I have had some in

346
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:33,440
the last year I had the hel jelly from

347
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:38,639
Humble seed company and I just had met

348
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:41,680
the guy that uh had whereami down in

349
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:44,039
Columbia he's Colombian American and

350
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:45,679
they have a heli jelly he was telling me

351
00:14:44,039 --> 00:14:48,399
about it but I he didn't have any with

352
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:52,679
him and then another friend here from

353
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:54,440
Vernon Drake he U came to visit me in

354
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:56,599
the summer and he brought me a few

355
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:59,120
different flavors and one of them was a

356
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:01,839
hey jelly two females actually one of

357
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:04,959
the fals was really nice and you know

358
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:07,240
jelly like it was nice it was sweet and

359
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:09,518
and I love that sweet fruity stuff I do

360
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:11,198
love the floral stuff as well it doesn't

361
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:14,278
have to be sweet and fruity I don't mind

362
00:15:11,198 --> 00:15:17,719
a little spice even the pinies and stuff

363
00:15:14,278 --> 00:15:20,519
like that there's so many permutations

364
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:23,079
of Aroma and flavor in the species that

365
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:24,799
it's just a joy to you know weave your

366
00:15:23,078 --> 00:15:27,919
way through them and and you start

367
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:29,879
leaning to certain departments you know

368
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:32,519
and some people really want that heavy

369
00:15:29,879 --> 00:15:35,078
Rank and some people want the real

370
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:38,399
ethereal light you know

371
00:15:35,078 --> 00:15:41,239
and I really have a thing for the narrow

372
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:47,278
leaf plants with what I call

373
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:47,278
the the high tones you know that they

374
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:52,919
have you don't get those notes in weed

375
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:55,600
that doesn't take 16 weeks to flour you

376
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:59,120
know that's pretty much what I'm saying

377
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:01,879
some of these Aromas in in that the

378
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:05,120
undiluted versions of them let's say you

379
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:08,240
can get hints of them crossed down with

380
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:12,240
Afghan and that but you know

381
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:14,959
the that family of plants the Afghan

382
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:18,318
plants which form the backbone of all

383
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:21,439
indoor breeding you know by and large

384
00:16:18,318 --> 00:16:24,759
and and modern breeding in general

385
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:28,279
they've been such a huge contribution to

386
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:30,278
potency and yield and you know hardiness

387
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:33,120
in certain conditions but they're of

388
00:16:30,278 --> 00:16:35,318
course absolutely not jungle plants if

389
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,120
you take those plants to the tropics

390
00:16:35,318 --> 00:16:39,838
forget it you know they're just going to

391
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:42,959
mold cuz they're designed to catch and

392
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:45,480
hold water not to shed it you know so

393
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:47,879
you need these pencils thin things and

394
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:49,639
they have they're not always Exquisite

395
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:51,000
I've had some pencil thin ones that I

396
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:54,720
couldn't stand the smell of on

397
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,839
Indonesian in particular but overall I

398
00:16:54,720 --> 00:17:00,000
would

399
00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:02,399
say my real passion is chasing the tall

400
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,838
skinny girls on this because they're

401
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:06,798
just so special that's definitely where

402
00:17:04,838 --> 00:17:08,798
my heart lies is with the the more

403
00:17:06,798 --> 00:17:12,160
equatorial sativas it's always been

404
00:17:08,798 --> 00:17:13,918
something that I really really love um I

405
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,720
just thought of a question that I had no

406
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:18,520
intention of asking you but since you

407
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:21,720
brought it up I want to know what your

408
00:17:18,519 --> 00:17:24,240
uh thought process is on this um me and

409
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:27,400
many others knowing you for now have

410
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:30,240
running tens of hundreds of thousands of

411
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:32,360
seeds at this point I think you would

412
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:35,919
know more than

413
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:39,759
anybody one of one of my Idols uh once

414
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:42,559
told me that they saw a link trait

415
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:46,000
between heavy hermaphrodism and the

416
00:17:42,558 --> 00:17:48,240
stinky smelly plants and saw less of

417
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,640
that in the sweet fenos have you seen

418
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:53,679
anything Sim similar or do you think

419
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:56,400
it's equally possible across the board

420
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:59,080
for me my experience is that it's

421
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:02,159
equally you know

422
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:04,480
I I hav never I mean not saying he's

423
00:18:02,159 --> 00:18:06,760
wrong I'm just saying I've never made a

424
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:09,400
correlation there that's never hit me

425
00:18:06,759 --> 00:18:12,200
that that was the

426
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:14,880
thing it's it's an interesting Theory

427
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:16,759
you know yeah I thought so too that's

428
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:19,039
not something I've seen I've seen her

429
00:18:16,759 --> 00:18:21,079
maites all across the board you

430
00:18:19,038 --> 00:18:24,640
depending on I think it's more based

431
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:26,480
upon the breeder and the the amount of

432
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:29,679
effort that they put into selecting and

433
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:33,960
knowing their their Cult of Art

434
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:37,038
it's true that's a lot of it the um I

435
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:39,038
never sold femin seeds you know and I

436
00:18:37,038 --> 00:18:42,720
was ruthless about killing her

437
00:18:39,038 --> 00:18:47,158
aphrodites back in the day and

438
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:51,640
uh I really think I think the only one I

439
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:55,960
ever had that I let through for sheer

440
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:59,000
potency at a really low amount was the

441
00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:03,159
p19 the mother of the

442
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:06,798
Blockhead and that one was it was so

443
00:19:03,159 --> 00:19:09,120
unique and so Punchy but if you did

444
00:19:06,798 --> 00:19:11,240
stress it too much you would see a few I

445
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:13,479
never I didn't have a problem getting

446
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:15,679
seed like you know hermaphrodite seed if

447
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:17,360
I did it since in the greenhouse but

448
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:19,080
I've heard you know from people i' give

449
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:22,079
the cuting to where they were really

450
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:23,639
cold or whatnot they would start to hey

451
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:25,240
you know I'm starting to get a Herm on

452
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:27,000
that I'm like oh I never saw it in my

453
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:29,359
hot Greenhouse where it was totally

454
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,119
happy I didn't to see it but when I

455
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:33,000
heard one or two people tell me that I

456
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:35,359
still didn't want to get rid of it

457
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,319
because it was one of the highest THC

458
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:39,558
things in the stable so I wanted it was

459
00:19:37,319 --> 00:19:41,319
like this is really Punchy and it

460
00:19:39,558 --> 00:19:45,359
doesn't smell or taste like anything

461
00:19:41,319 --> 00:19:48,079
else it was really unusual and

462
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:50,558
uh that was a neat plant the blockhead I

463
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:53,079
really like the blockhead and I I had

464
00:19:50,558 --> 00:19:55,480
the odd person mention it that they was

465
00:19:53,079 --> 00:19:58,079
saying you know that's the only one of

466
00:19:55,480 --> 00:20:00,079
your seeds I ever got her ra it I never

467
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:02,480
got got one in your sweet te never got

468
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:05,839
one in your Shish Berry never got one in

469
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:09,159
the tropical trops or tropas or any of

470
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:13,000
the other things but the rockhead and

471
00:20:09,159 --> 00:20:14,679
got a couple I was like but but they're

472
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,279
like but the rest of them are

473
00:20:14,679 --> 00:20:20,280
awesome You released them you know I

474
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:22,279
like good good but overall I've had a

475
00:20:20,279 --> 00:20:25,000
real prejudice against them you know

476
00:20:22,279 --> 00:20:27,000
like because I don't like a seed popping

477
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,679
in my joint I'm a smoker first and

478
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,279
foremost right and

479
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:34,679
it just ruins the joint and it's so

480
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:39,079
funny I know it's not even funny like

481
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:43,000
funny funny it's funny sad but I see

482
00:20:39,079 --> 00:20:45,639
legal Market joints in Canada with seeds

483
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,440
popping in them that people are cutting

484
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:50,480
open joints with seeds like half the

485
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:53,000
weight of the joint being seeds and

486
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:55,120
stuff and from one producer twice on

487
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,798
different batches six months apart with

488
00:20:55,119 --> 00:21:00,439
different plants and you're like how can

489
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:03,639
you do do pre-rolls with half the weight

490
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:05,279
seed and not noticed half the weight it

491
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:09,480
was like the guy weighted on it was like

492
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:12,558
a one G joint it was 49 seed and .51

493
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:15,640
Shake you know it just looked awful was

494
00:21:12,558 --> 00:21:18,960
this in Canada yeah that was in Canada

495
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:22,240
and then somebody else gifted me some

496
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:23,759
and um I can't even remember who's it

497
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,480
was or anything because I'm not that

498
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:28,839
familiar with all the brands but the but

499
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,319
I was really up you know pal cuz he

500
00:21:28,839 --> 00:21:31,480
pulled it out it's like here this is

501
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:34,399
really nice joint you're going to like

502
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:36,839
it and it's like a $15 joint and I think

503
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,960
of joints like you know 10 cents or

504
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:42,720
whatever because I grow my own it and

505
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:46,240
I'm like $15 joint oh my God and uh I

506
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:50,000
smoke the thing [ __ ] pop are you

507
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:52,960
[ __ ] kidding me you know like get it

508
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:56,000
together you know if you can't be a

509
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:58,519
professional Bud sales and sell seed in

510
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,038
your bud you know I thought the only

511
00:21:58,519 --> 00:22:03,798
smart way you could do that is in Canada

512
00:22:01,038 --> 00:22:07,119
they over tax seeds it's a dollar a seed

513
00:22:03,798 --> 00:22:09,119
excise tax that's ridiculous in my head

514
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:11,158
I can't get my head around playing that

515
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:13,199
game because I want to sell seeds for

516
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:16,640
less than that like packs of sunflowers

517
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:18,080
you know so the the thing that drives me

518
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:22,600
nuts

519
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:24,720
is why should they get 50 60,000 a kilo

520
00:22:22,599 --> 00:22:27,439
from your seeds that's you taxing the UN

521
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:29,278
board you don't even know if it's a mail

522
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,960
or whatever like give me a break now

523
00:22:29,278 --> 00:22:33,720
you're going to tax the seed that's not

524
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:35,919
even alive yet might not Sprout like

525
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:39,240
it's just overreach you know it's a

526
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:41,440
paing overreach um so I don't know if I

527
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:43,679
have to ask you or not that's you know

528
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:45,640
that's a reason why I vitalized you and

529
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:47,320
your work is because you've always put

530
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:51,360
quality first and

531
00:22:47,319 --> 00:22:53,399
foremost how do you feel about new seed

532
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:55,918
companies a lot of them coming out a lot

533
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:59,360
of them Ste a lot of them coming out are

534
00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:01,520
saying there's no need to test these if

535
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:05,359
we knew the mother was good we knew the

536
00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:07,319
Fe the the father was good and there's

537
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:10,240
no reason to test these seeds because

538
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:11,839
there's a certain amount of instability

539
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,679
that is in cannabis and it will always

540
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:17,319
be

541
00:23:12,679 --> 00:23:21,320
there well ideally you want to test it

542
00:23:17,319 --> 00:23:23,678
first but I absolutely sympathize with

543
00:23:21,319 --> 00:23:26,960
people who know that they're like the

544
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:29,120
mother's killer the father's killer no

545
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,679
matter what the [ __ ] kids are going

546
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:33,038
to look good we don't know what they're

547
00:23:30,679 --> 00:23:35,679
going to look like but they're going to

548
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:37,839
look good so if you want to play that

549
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:40,559
game that's your brand to play with you

550
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:43,639
know and and that's really all that's

551
00:23:40,558 --> 00:23:47,678
happening in the you know the bleeding

552
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:50,200
edge I think of the hype is always you

553
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:52,640
have to be the newest of the new new so

554
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:54,880
you got to get the tour's newest and

555
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:57,080
cross them before anybody else and then

556
00:23:54,880 --> 00:24:00,360
it's the newest new new you know so

557
00:23:57,079 --> 00:24:03,639
there's just this like arms race to be

558
00:24:00,359 --> 00:24:06,558
have the next inevitable crosses made on

559
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:08,559
the road to homogenization you know

560
00:24:06,558 --> 00:24:10,319
everything's good by the time it's all

561
00:24:08,558 --> 00:24:13,399
mixed together there it'll eventually

562
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:15,519
all be the same anyway but no it's

563
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:17,600
awesome because you think think like a

564
00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:19,918
million monkeys that could come up with

565
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:23,199
Shakespeare right a million monkeys with

566
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:25,559
tyrers or whatever that's how I think

567
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:28,200
about it and that's and that's how it's

568
00:24:25,558 --> 00:24:30,639
survived that's how it's evolved is is

569
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:32,840
you know all of us Growers saving seeds

570
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:35,919
for whatever turns us on about those

571
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:38,959
plants all over the world for Millennia

572
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:42,278
Millennia right so we're just a little

573
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:45,399
Link in a very long chain you know and

574
00:24:42,278 --> 00:24:48,640
we all get to make some picks and make

575
00:24:45,398 --> 00:24:51,879
some crosses and and put our stamp on it

576
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:53,520
for the next Generation you know and uh

577
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:55,919
some of us will do more of it than

578
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:58,079
others but it's just as long you know if

579
00:24:55,919 --> 00:25:01,080
you're into it definitely do something

580
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:03,879
make one for yourself you know find your

581
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:05,480
favorites and and make something yeah I

582
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:07,880
really encourage people to breed their

583
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:10,480
own I think it's awesome you know that's

584
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:13,919
how I started pure out of Hobby and I

585
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:16,480
really you know I didn't go far with

586
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:19,559
breeding in formal education I studied

587
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:22,519
other things but I employed PhD breeders

588
00:25:19,558 --> 00:25:25,278
and master agronomists and all this and

589
00:25:22,519 --> 00:25:28,558
I learned so much from my staff all the

590
00:25:25,278 --> 00:25:31,720
time you know because I'm not know the

591
00:25:28,558 --> 00:25:34,918
most versed in molecular genomics but

592
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:39,640
I'm totally stoked to read Great Links

593
00:25:34,919 --> 00:25:41,720
and to learn about it and uh I I know

594
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:43,960
because I have looked at it for quite a

595
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:46,360
while what can be done with it like bone

596
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:48,120
before we could ever get our hands here

597
00:25:46,359 --> 00:25:49,719
you know 20 years ago I'd sit in my

598
00:25:48,119 --> 00:25:52,038
office in Switzerland and be reading

599
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:53,798
about this going oh if we could only do

600
00:25:52,038 --> 00:25:55,440
this you know think of what we could do

601
00:25:53,798 --> 00:25:57,798
but at that time it was like if you

602
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:00,440
weren't you know a big government like

603
00:25:57,798 --> 00:26:03,079
the us or Monsanto or somebody you were

604
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:07,519
not sequencing anything right and now

605
00:26:03,079 --> 00:26:10,678
it's become so affordable and you know

606
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:13,918
available it's it's happening so it's

607
00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:18,200
beautiful beautiful to see the world you

608
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:21,080
know catching up with cannabis as what

609
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:23,440
it was meant to be is just for everybody

610
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:26,839
and it's been locked down for a hundred

611
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:29,278
years and as it comes back up it gets to

612
00:26:26,839 --> 00:26:31,319
enter the modern world with all the you

613
00:26:29,278 --> 00:26:34,720
know stuff

614
00:26:31,319 --> 00:26:36,398
is it hasn't been able to access when it

615
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,640
was underground you know so the

616
00:26:36,398 --> 00:26:43,519
attention that it's getting in research

617
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:46,038
circles now you know in so many types of

618
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:48,759
research from medicine you know not just

619
00:26:46,038 --> 00:26:52,440
in growing in that too it's it's so

620
00:26:48,759 --> 00:26:55,960
astounding to see how how mainstream has

621
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:57,720
become you know I still pinched myself

622
00:26:55,960 --> 00:27:01,278
sometimes that you know we're living in

623
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:04,240
the times we are it's like it's been

624
00:27:01,278 --> 00:27:05,880
hellish for so many but it's seems to be

625
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,640
turning the corner it's still hellish

626
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:10,200
for so many let's face it for the

627
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:12,720
majority it's still horrible there's

628
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:14,919
definitely a a blessing that's been

629
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:17,038
bestowed upon a lot of the world that

630
00:27:14,919 --> 00:27:21,000
you don't didn't have that

631
00:27:17,038 --> 00:27:23,759
before um one of our patreon members

632
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,720
Jesse James from Australia uh wants to

633
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:28,319
follow up with you everybody's got their

634
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:30,919
own you know

635
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:32,960
checkbox of what they want and what they

636
00:27:30,919 --> 00:27:36,360
want to breed forward to he wants to

637
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:40,480
know how do you uh test your

638
00:27:36,359 --> 00:27:44,558
plant well we have a inhouse at the main

639
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:47,880
Farm we have I'm trying to think of the

640
00:27:44,558 --> 00:27:51,879
brand it I believe it's a Korean one but

641
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:53,840
I forget for sure but we have the GC and

642
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:57,679
an LC there so we can test for

643
00:27:53,839 --> 00:28:00,319
cannaboids and Turin on site and then

644
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:02,919
the genomas send off samples but I don't

645
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:06,519
know which Labs they're using them

646
00:28:02,919 --> 00:28:08,600
because they interpret them for me and I

647
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:10,919
say I your genetics interpreters because

648
00:28:08,599 --> 00:28:13,158
I can't read a sequencing report you

649
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:16,360
know but I can

650
00:28:13,159 --> 00:28:18,600
segregate the traits you know and say

651
00:28:16,359 --> 00:28:21,038
okay I know that group a is all purple

652
00:28:18,599 --> 00:28:23,439
plants and group b is all green plants

653
00:28:21,038 --> 00:28:26,038
but I'm not going to tell them what the

654
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:28,440
trade is I just send you off group a and

655
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:32,558
Group B samples and you got 50 tissue

656
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:36,600
samples of each and they'll analyze them

657
00:28:32,558 --> 00:28:41,759
and then do a comparative analysis to

658
00:28:36,599 --> 00:28:46,240
see which you know plasma is different

659
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:49,960
you know which section of the chromosome

660
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:52,798
is different in these groups you know

661
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:55,278
and and then you say okay then you can

662
00:28:52,798 --> 00:28:58,079
tell them this one's purple this one's

663
00:28:55,278 --> 00:29:01,839
green you know so you can do that with

664
00:28:58,079 --> 00:29:04,639
resistance to any pathogen you know if

665
00:29:01,839 --> 00:29:07,678
you had mildo resistant plant or virus

666
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:10,240
resistant plant and then you have ones

667
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:12,000
that are susceptible but they're sisters

668
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:14,519
and they're otherwise pretty much the

669
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,919
same it's just that some are better

670
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:19,359
against the Milo than others so that's

671
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:21,360
how those types of genes get identified

672
00:29:19,359 --> 00:29:24,439
is they're you

673
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:27,000
segregate the plants and then look for

674
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:29,798
the common denominator in each group

675
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:32,319
that's different from the other one so

676
00:29:29,798 --> 00:29:36,240
that's how that's how we do it and then

677
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:38,519
you have you can develop once you know I

678
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:42,159
don't know if it's proteins or enzymes

679
00:29:38,519 --> 00:29:45,919
whatever they need to turn the colors

680
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:49,399
they can do oneoff dropper kits where

681
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:52,038
you can pulverize the sample and say you

682
00:29:49,398 --> 00:29:54,000
can put a drop in and either stays Blue

683
00:29:52,038 --> 00:29:56,599
if it's a male or turns pink if it's a

684
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:00,038
female you know you can do these single

685
00:29:56,599 --> 00:30:02,439
tests to once you you can develop them

686
00:30:00,038 --> 00:30:04,158
it's not like they're automatic but you

687
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:06,399
have to know something about the

688
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:09,880
biochemistry which I could never figure

689
00:30:06,398 --> 00:30:09,879
out in the life of me you

690
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:18,519
know I just don't know exactly how you

691
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:21,278
go about going oh well to break down

692
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:23,519
this enzyme into pink we need this or to

693
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:26,159
make this one flip I don't know how that

694
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:30,200
stuff works I know what I want them to

695
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:32,880
do and figure out it's done you know

696
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:37,200
what what would first plant Steve think

697
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:39,440
about Steve now and all these different

698
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:42,759
pieces of equipment that you have access

699
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:45,558
to to do what you do did you ever think

700
00:30:42,759 --> 00:30:47,759
hey I never a point where you had so

701
00:30:45,558 --> 00:30:50,558
much passion and you were like I'm GNA

702
00:30:47,759 --> 00:30:54,558
take it to this level yeah yeah you know

703
00:30:50,558 --> 00:30:56,638
what I think I was still thinking of it

704
00:30:54,558 --> 00:30:59,879
as a hobbyist that I wanted to do it

705
00:30:56,638 --> 00:31:02,479
hardcore like when I was in university

706
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:05,360
was really when I got at it you know and

707
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:07,159
uh when I I went to University a year

708
00:31:05,359 --> 00:31:08,359
early I finished high school in four

709
00:31:07,159 --> 00:31:11,799
years so

710
00:31:08,359 --> 00:31:15,759
the the uh that's really when I got into

711
00:31:11,798 --> 00:31:17,960
growing and I I went there to do

712
00:31:15,759 --> 00:31:21,278
constitutional law thinking that would

713
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:23,679
help me legalize her but after sitting

714
00:31:21,278 --> 00:31:26,960
through the classes and the people and I

715
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:28,759
felt like it there was it was just such

716
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:31,880
a Square

717
00:31:28,759 --> 00:31:33,759
environment and I was more of a you

718
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:36,360
daily doser kind of

719
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:39,278
guy even though I want to really

720
00:31:36,359 --> 00:31:41,398
understand all this you I can't hang out

721
00:31:39,278 --> 00:31:44,759
here all day you know what I mean it was

722
00:31:41,398 --> 00:31:46,359
too much I didn't I couldn't get my head

723
00:31:44,759 --> 00:31:49,119
around it I would say you know what is

724
00:31:46,359 --> 00:31:52,158
the legitimacy of all this constitution

725
00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:55,199
where does it come from like okay from a

726
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:57,840
a for from a king or queen somewhere and

727
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:01,360
where does their legitimacy come from

728
00:31:57,839 --> 00:32:03,240
oh from some God botherer in a funny hat

729
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:05,839
you know give me a break this is a

730
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:08,319
[ __ ] fairy tale doesn't makes sense

731
00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:10,480
the land's founded on genocide there's

732
00:32:08,319 --> 00:32:13,480
no other way to put it you know what I

733
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:16,200
mean it's like where's the legitimacy of

734
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:19,798
this institution there's to me it lacks

735
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:21,960
legitimacy so I say the best I got to

736
00:32:19,798 --> 00:32:24,960
accept is it's like a mafia that rules

737
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:27,880
the land and extorts the people and

738
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:30,960
controls their lives I think you know

739
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:33,600
you've just got to Bob and weave a

740
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:37,240
little and just you know maybe one leg

741
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:40,599
in one leg out for lot of people like be

742
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:43,200
you know enough to stay somewhat San

743
00:32:40,599 --> 00:32:44,959
because to me it's just a once you kind

744
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:47,840
of look at the big picture it's quite

745
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:51,600
scary and you think oh man this is this

746
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:55,278
is whack you know right anyway I I've

747
00:32:51,599 --> 00:32:57,599
been I'm so far gone I really dream of a

748
00:32:55,278 --> 00:33:00,000
postnational future for all

749
00:32:57,599 --> 00:33:02,319
earthlings because I think the nation

750
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,720
states that divide us are you know the

751
00:33:02,319 --> 00:33:09,119
biggest problems you know it's the

752
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:13,759
stains on our planet you know so let the

753
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:15,918
Earths be so when you were um coming up

754
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:17,960
with a spice alive seed company was

755
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:20,679
there you know I would I would love to

756
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:22,840
say a company it wasn't a company it was

757
00:33:20,679 --> 00:33:25,278
just spice of Life Seeds I didn't make

758
00:33:22,839 --> 00:33:28,199
it a company because then then you're

759
00:33:25,278 --> 00:33:30,519
it's part of the system I mean I was

760
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:33,798
really a whack out there at the time now

761
00:33:30,519 --> 00:33:36,278
I have companies but at the time when I

762
00:33:33,798 --> 00:33:39,240
first started that it was really just a

763
00:33:36,278 --> 00:33:41,759
hobby and then it was an activism you

764
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:44,079
know before it was actually really a

765
00:33:41,759 --> 00:33:46,480
business because I never like took a

766
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:48,720
bunch of money from that endeavor and

767
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:51,120
bought anything all I ever did was rent

768
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:54,679
more houses to breed more pot you know

769
00:33:51,119 --> 00:33:57,000
it all just rolled back into it and uh

770
00:33:54,679 --> 00:33:58,798
it was just a joy doing it you know if

771
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:01,038
wasn't like I was going buying a new

772
00:33:58,798 --> 00:34:04,679
Ferrari every year with it or anything

773
00:34:01,038 --> 00:34:06,759
right right that was my mistake that's

774
00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:08,039
right I'm just kidding no it was never

775
00:34:06,759 --> 00:34:10,480
you know I never because I always

776
00:34:08,039 --> 00:34:12,800
figured too I was like oh if you do

777
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:14,878
accumulate a bunch from it then when

778
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,839
they come and get you they've got

779
00:34:14,878 --> 00:34:19,480
something to take and they're you're

780
00:34:16,838 --> 00:34:21,719
more attractive to them whereas if You'

781
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:24,159
got nothing because you just kept

782
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:27,678
spending it on concert tickets and

783
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:29,639
growing more weed and uh there's nothing

784
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:31,599
for them to take so you know I was

785
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:33,039
always like I never want them to come

786
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:36,639
and say oh we found the dude with a

787
00:34:33,039 --> 00:34:39,159
bunch of cash on keep it spent you know

788
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:40,919
what concerts were you spending it on oh

789
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:43,398
God I don't know just go we would go out

790
00:34:40,918 --> 00:34:45,960
to see bands in Vancouver every night

791
00:34:43,398 --> 00:34:48,878
and you know just go to restaurants and

792
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:52,398
have fun in town back in the back in the

793
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:54,279
mid 90s there it was quite a time yeah

794
00:34:52,398 --> 00:34:58,000
that sounds like a great life just that

795
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:59,280
alone uh did you have any Idols coming

796
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,880
up in that

797
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:07,119
time well you know there was

798
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:09,838
um a couple guys I really should think

799
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:13,240
and one would be Ed rosenal and Mel

800
00:35:09,838 --> 00:35:16,159
Frank or two I guess because I remember

801
00:35:13,239 --> 00:35:18,439
their book was the first one I'd read

802
00:35:16,159 --> 00:35:20,519
but I'd ordered it at the same time I

803
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:22,599
ordered marijuana botney with Robert

804
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:24,639
conell Clark and I ordered those like

805
00:35:22,599 --> 00:35:28,359
with money orders out of a back of a

806
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:30,559
high times you know I sure then got them

807
00:35:28,358 --> 00:35:33,480
mailed to me at University so I've read

808
00:35:30,559 --> 00:35:36,838
their books and really back to back so I

809
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:38,838
had the Growers guide and then the uh

810
00:35:36,838 --> 00:35:42,480
marijuana botney which is more about

811
00:35:38,838 --> 00:35:44,480
breeding and I was hooked simultaneously

812
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:46,800
you know I was like you know it was

813
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:50,159
obvious to me I had to do both not just

814
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:52,599
one you know so I really felt compelled

815
00:35:50,159 --> 00:35:56,279
but I still you know grow a little sense

816
00:35:52,599 --> 00:35:58,200
crop with 400 watts under the stairwell

817
00:35:56,280 --> 00:36:00,000
in the studio student house you know

818
00:35:58,199 --> 00:36:02,199
wouldn't bother making seeds in there or

819
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,599
something but for keeping like an

820
00:36:02,199 --> 00:36:07,480
envelope of pollen and just seeding a

821
00:36:04,599 --> 00:36:09,160
bottom branch of a big outdoor Bud on a

822
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:11,079
day when it's not windy you know just

823
00:36:09,159 --> 00:36:13,078
hit that bottom I would just have seed

824
00:36:11,079 --> 00:36:15,599
in the bottom branch and the rest of it

825
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:18,560
would be sense you know so I was good at

826
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:22,079
just you know selectively seeding

827
00:36:18,559 --> 00:36:23,599
different branches for having a bunch of

828
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:25,240
different crosses and that would get you

829
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:27,039
a jar of each which is more than I

830
00:36:25,239 --> 00:36:29,159
needed everybody always want wanted to

831
00:36:27,039 --> 00:36:32,279
buy my homegrown CU I would really hit

832
00:36:29,159 --> 00:36:34,318
it out of the park with nice 12 type

833
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:37,119
organic mix type of thing and always

834
00:36:34,318 --> 00:36:39,559
good at picking a sunny sight and stuff

835
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:41,280
and I would never sell my homegrown

836
00:36:39,559 --> 00:36:43,119
because he can't replace it so but I

837
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:45,800
would always tell people if you want to

838
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:47,880
do it here's a one page on how to you

839
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:50,318
know mix the soil and plant a hole and

840
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:52,480
pick a site and stuff I got a one page

841
00:36:50,318 --> 00:36:54,358
how to and I'll give you 20 seeds so

842
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:56,280
just you go and do it and if you get it

843
00:36:54,358 --> 00:36:59,799
figure it out teach other people how to

844
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:02,319
do it you know it really was just

845
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:04,440
wanting to get it out there and keep it

846
00:37:02,318 --> 00:37:06,719
alive because all the forces that be in

847
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:09,200
the world we're trying to make the

848
00:37:06,719 --> 00:37:12,838
species extinct which you know if that

849
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:15,960
isn't proof enough of their you know

850
00:37:12,838 --> 00:37:18,400
lack of legitimacy you know what right

851
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:20,679
do they have to exist This legal fiction

852
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:23,838
to Outlaw a

853
00:37:20,679 --> 00:37:26,759
species I get some heray in the chat

854
00:37:23,838 --> 00:37:29,078
that's ridiculous I think everybody

855
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:30,920
agrees with you here you are on the

856
00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:34,200
right podcast

857
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:36,920
sir I tell you

858
00:37:34,199 --> 00:37:39,159
guys yeah man I vied with you a lot and

859
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:41,440
I had no idea we talked before the show

860
00:37:39,159 --> 00:37:43,118
you said you had your own Winery for a

861
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:45,599
while you really got into wine yeah I

862
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:48,680
dropped for a while and I did wine for

863
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:51,800
15 years even did certified organic wine

864
00:37:48,679 --> 00:37:53,639
at that that's really Co what are some

865
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:55,599
of your favorite wines I just started

866
00:37:53,639 --> 00:37:57,838
getting into wine a couple years ago

867
00:37:55,599 --> 00:38:01,160
seriously

868
00:37:57,838 --> 00:38:03,559
well I'd like all of them pretty much if

869
00:38:01,159 --> 00:38:06,000
they're done really really well like any

870
00:38:03,559 --> 00:38:08,119
type of wine or any region it's always

871
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,280
nice to have the best of any region you

872
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:12,800
know because like a reasoning from the

873
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:14,480
alsas is great if it's a really nice one

874
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,680
and a reasoning from the Oak and Aug

875
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:19,358
grade if it's a really nice one and even

876
00:38:16,679 --> 00:38:22,559
from Niagara too right so on the other

877
00:38:19,358 --> 00:38:25,318
hand you get a very different cab so in

878
00:38:22,559 --> 00:38:28,239
Napa than you do in Niagara

879
00:38:25,318 --> 00:38:30,519
so you there's a whole lot to choose

880
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:33,118
from in wine and that wine I always

881
00:38:30,519 --> 00:38:35,280
figured it was important like I started

882
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:37,838
to love wine when I moved to Switzerland

883
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:39,760
to grow weed so I just sort of TR you

884
00:38:37,838 --> 00:38:41,799
know learned about that my first wine

885
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:44,319
tour was in burgundy with a friend from

886
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:48,000
Switzerland oh wow been going he'd been

887
00:38:44,318 --> 00:38:50,880
going every month since he was five with

888
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,838
his dad to buy their household wine and

889
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:55,039
so he knew burgundy like the back of his

890
00:38:52,838 --> 00:38:57,440
hand so it was really a eye opener for

891
00:38:55,039 --> 00:38:58,920
me that trip and that was only like my

892
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:02,159
first year living in

893
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:02,159
swier and

894
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:10,359
then then later once we had kids and we

895
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:13,680
said you know when the Swiss Place

896
00:39:10,358 --> 00:39:15,759
started to be a hassle we said let's

897
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:18,039
just change gears and try making wine

898
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:21,599
for a while while the kids are young and

899
00:39:18,039 --> 00:39:23,318
do something non-controversial so I did

900
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:25,000
that and I figured oh by the time I

901
00:39:23,318 --> 00:39:28,279
learned to make wine and get good at

902
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:31,239
that I'll learned something about

903
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:33,280
um the cuz I figured when cannabis was

904
00:39:31,239 --> 00:39:35,318
legal it was going to fall into place

905
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:37,000
much like the wiy business and

906
00:39:35,318 --> 00:39:40,279
eventually it is here like now they're

907
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:42,920
going to allow the craft Growers to open

908
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:44,880
up direct sales because if you're a

909
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:46,559
craft grower and you can only sell to

910
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:48,440
the government you're pretty screwed you

911
00:39:46,559 --> 00:39:50,799
know you don't have any bargaining power

912
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:53,720
there whereas if you have directed the

913
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:55,480
public you have U you know closer to

914
00:39:53,719 --> 00:39:57,159
what the market will bear for what

915
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:59,400
you're growing and you get a better

916
00:39:57,159 --> 00:40:01,838
spread and that's how in BC that's how

917
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:04,559
the wineries if they're landbased

918
00:40:01,838 --> 00:40:07,519
wineries they can sell direct to the

919
00:40:04,559 --> 00:40:10,400
public and they only pay sales tax

920
00:40:07,519 --> 00:40:12,559
there's no excise tax on it where and

921
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:14,358
they can have tastings and they people

922
00:40:12,559 --> 00:40:17,559
can come and buy some and go sit up on

923
00:40:14,358 --> 00:40:19,639
the hill and enjoy it you know I thought

924
00:40:17,559 --> 00:40:21,799
this is exactly what cannabis is going

925
00:40:19,639 --> 00:40:23,838
to be like when it's legal in Canada it

926
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:27,480
won't be like what I had in Switzerland

927
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:29,519
here they'll license it and tax it and

928
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:32,318
that's fine if it's reasonable we can

929
00:40:29,519 --> 00:40:36,318
live with that but it's if it's too much

930
00:40:32,318 --> 00:40:38,239
it's just embarrassing so it was a a

931
00:40:36,318 --> 00:40:40,719
parallel universe of flavorful

932
00:40:38,239 --> 00:40:44,318
intoxicants making wine because you're

933
00:40:40,719 --> 00:40:47,679
growing something to make something that

934
00:40:44,318 --> 00:40:50,679
smells great and tastes great and has an

935
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:54,199
effect and and ostensibly some medical

936
00:40:50,679 --> 00:40:56,879
benefit too in moderation right glass of

937
00:40:54,199 --> 00:40:59,439
red wine a day or whatever who know true

938
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:01,838
it's just an appreciate tping and being

939
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:04,400
able to pull out all those flavor

940
00:41:01,838 --> 00:41:07,039
profiles and it was funny while I was in

941
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:10,559
Switzerland I was in an area where they

942
00:41:07,039 --> 00:41:13,480
only grew Mero the whole valley was Mero

943
00:41:10,559 --> 00:41:16,358
basically they it was all the greates

944
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:18,838
and you all the different country

945
00:41:16,358 --> 00:41:20,799
restaurants had their own Mero and they

946
00:41:18,838 --> 00:41:23,599
didn't bottle it you got a jug at the

947
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:25,519
table with your dinner you know so and

948
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:28,039
they drank it out of Bal lii they look

949
00:41:25,519 --> 00:41:29,559
like little finger bows and people

950
00:41:28,039 --> 00:41:31,279
didn't believe me they had guests come

951
00:41:29,559 --> 00:41:32,639
out they see me drinking you're drinking

952
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,680
out of the finger bow I'm like no that's

953
00:41:32,639 --> 00:41:36,559
B that's how they drink here so they'd

954
00:41:34,679 --> 00:41:38,960
give you like a ceramic jug with a liter

955
00:41:36,559 --> 00:41:41,400
of wine that was like 20 Franks which

956
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:43,358
was like 20 Canadian back then so you

957
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:45,200
judge these restaurants not just on

958
00:41:43,358 --> 00:41:47,119
their food but by their wine because it

959
00:41:45,199 --> 00:41:49,118
was literally their wine you park by the

960
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:51,559
vines and just walk in so it was very

961
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:53,400
rustic and I really thought it was super

962
00:41:51,559 --> 00:41:57,279
cool how that was and most of them would

963
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:59,920
never bottle their wine but um

964
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:03,760
I realized boy they've got all the good

965
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:07,480
grow sites too and if you're remember

966
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:10,560
from way back when you had to hide your

967
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:13,400
plants the most successful commercial

968
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:16,440
pot production was always blended into

969
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:18,240
other agriculture so the common thing

970
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:20,240
would be corn but of course they'd look

971
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:23,759
in corn because everybody grows their

972
00:42:20,239 --> 00:42:25,719
read in the corn right but in Vineyards

973
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:28,240
is not quite as common but it's still

974
00:42:25,719 --> 00:42:30,318
done so there's you can grow weed at a

975
00:42:28,239 --> 00:42:33,399
Vineyard so if you've got you know 100

976
00:42:30,318 --> 00:42:36,400
acres of irrigated drip line and

977
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:39,200
trellising all out there and another

978
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:41,680
cover crop you could easily put in 10

979
00:42:39,199 --> 00:42:44,039
acres of weat if you did every 10 plant

980
00:42:41,679 --> 00:42:46,838
right or every 20th plant would be like

981
00:42:44,039 --> 00:42:49,079
five acres of weed so you that's how the

982
00:42:46,838 --> 00:42:51,799
large scale commercial production has

983
00:42:49,079 --> 00:42:53,760
always been done is Blended with other

984
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:56,640
agriculture so that it can be right out

985
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:58,079
in the open and worked on openly without

986
00:42:56,639 --> 00:43:00,799
you you know you can't go and hide a

987
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:03,400
field in the bush you know you can only

988
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:06,440
hide a field within a field you know and

989
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:08,880
that's the that's how it used to be so

990
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:10,639
anyway so I thought if I had a Vineyard

991
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:12,400
I could start testing out some plants

992
00:43:10,639 --> 00:43:14,719
and be see how they like growing with

993
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:17,720
the vines I had a friend in Switzerland

994
00:43:14,719 --> 00:43:20,439
that bought a Vineyard ripped out all

995
00:43:17,719 --> 00:43:22,159
the plants and kept the trellising which

996
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:25,119
was in Switzerland they had concrete

997
00:43:22,159 --> 00:43:27,239
post with the steel wires and so the

998
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:29,160
neighbors were all really pissed because

999
00:43:27,239 --> 00:43:30,799
it was surrounded by apartment buildings

1000
00:43:29,159 --> 00:43:33,399
it was this big Vineyard in between

1001
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:36,960
apartment buildings he ripped it all out

1002
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:38,920
and planted it the people were really

1003
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:40,639
pissed because they likeed The View over

1004
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:44,119
the vineyard and they did not like the

1005
00:43:40,639 --> 00:43:46,838
view and the aroma from his Urban fields

1006
00:43:44,119 --> 00:43:49,440
that guy was Felix that was in Lardo

1007
00:43:46,838 --> 00:43:51,519
that was the funniest place it was the

1008
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:55,000
craziest place that was so funny do I

1009
00:43:51,519 --> 00:43:58,679
have to bleep that out that name no

1010
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:00,880
everybody know back there I I hope he's

1011
00:43:58,679 --> 00:44:02,719
well I hope he's watching but I'm sure

1012
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:04,240
they still do that here still playing

1013
00:44:02,719 --> 00:44:06,639
cannabis in the middle of the vineyard

1014
00:44:04,239 --> 00:44:08,759
weed and I swear to God everything that

1015
00:44:06,639 --> 00:44:10,719
I've had out of those something about

1016
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:15,839
the microbiology and the soil it makes

1017
00:44:10,719 --> 00:44:17,759
it taste like FY I've had some excellent

1018
00:44:15,838 --> 00:44:19,719
Vineyard weed actually one of my

1019
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:22,200
favorite ones I grew in the vineyard was

1020
00:44:19,719 --> 00:44:24,598
actually grapefruit and it was one of

1021
00:44:22,199 --> 00:44:28,078
the strongest ones I had too this decent

1022
00:44:24,599 --> 00:44:31,599
altitude and and it was a hot year and

1023
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:34,039
dry there was you know all those the

1024
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:35,920
grapefruit that was a real hitter I

1025
00:44:34,039 --> 00:44:37,800
remember to that was like I remember

1026
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:39,880
having that thinking this is maybe the

1027
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:41,680
strongest grapefruit I've ever grown and

1028
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:43,559
I've grown some good strong grapefruit

1029
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:45,399
before like as strong as it could be I

1030
00:44:43,559 --> 00:44:47,319
thought but when I pulled some out of

1031
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:49,760
the vineyard I was I had some friends

1032
00:44:47,318 --> 00:44:52,079
that it did put the Herd on and I hadn't

1033
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:53,960
seen that before where they were like oh

1034
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:56,240
that joint just destroyed me and they

1035
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:57,920
were not they were like losing their

1036
00:44:56,239 --> 00:44:59,838
[ __ ] and I was like it's not usually

1037
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:02,240
that strong but this is really

1038
00:44:59,838 --> 00:45:03,799
exceptionally good for grapefruit so I

1039
00:45:02,239 --> 00:45:08,439
never had that tested I would have like

1040
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:10,680
to pest that match but yeah it's fun the

1041
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:12,800
I I always remember that in Switzerland

1042
00:45:10,679 --> 00:45:14,118
seeing all these Vineyards around going

1043
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:15,680
because especially because we'd have

1044
00:45:14,119 --> 00:45:17,680
trouble with rippers we'd be growing

1045
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:19,639
like solid fields of it or solid green

1046
00:45:17,679 --> 00:45:24,358
houses of it or solid warehouses of it

1047
00:45:19,639 --> 00:45:27,318
and rippers were always a concern and uh

1048
00:45:24,358 --> 00:45:29,759
he got hit by some and definitely hit

1049
00:45:27,318 --> 00:45:32,920
some back but the

1050
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:36,240
uh the

1051
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:38,800
uh thinking boy I bet you if I just put

1052
00:45:36,239 --> 00:45:41,279
in these Vineyards you wouldn't see it

1053
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:43,160
you know nobody even no Thief is going

1054
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:45,880
in the vineyard they're not there to

1055
00:45:43,159 --> 00:45:47,558
steal grapes you know no Thief is going

1056
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:51,079
into Vine so I thought I bet you they'd

1057
00:45:47,559 --> 00:45:53,519
be safer out there than behind the fence

1058
00:45:51,079 --> 00:45:54,920
you behind the fence people like hey

1059
00:45:53,519 --> 00:45:56,480
what's in there we got to get it you

1060
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:58,519
know there's greenhous Le behind the

1061
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:00,480
fence in the vineyard they just walk

1062
00:45:58,519 --> 00:46:02,559
right past us they would never go look

1063
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:04,079
in the vineyard you know it's just too

1064
00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:06,400
much work to go look up and down the

1065
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:08,160
roads right nobody had drones back then

1066
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:10,639
that's the thing Ontario the Rippers are

1067
00:46:08,159 --> 00:46:14,039
so bad now they've got drones all over

1068
00:46:10,639 --> 00:46:16,318
the place and people chasing going in

1069
00:46:14,039 --> 00:46:18,480
with flags just like you know the cops

1070
00:46:16,318 --> 00:46:20,880
used to go in with the flags into the

1071
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:23,280
cornfield like the tall flag so the

1072
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:27,160
Choppers could tell them where to go

1073
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:29,119
because they know where they are and uh

1074
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:32,199
yeah the Rippers are doing that so I

1075
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:33,920
think but I mean the best thing is just

1076
00:46:32,199 --> 00:46:36,000
that you leave it alone till it's so

1077
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:39,280
ubiquitous and it's not worth stealing

1078
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:41,079
just like grapes you know I actually had

1079
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:43,000
had people come and steal grapes from

1080
00:46:41,079 --> 00:46:45,880
the the stuff that was growing over the

1081
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:48,280
fence I had like C like a family that

1082
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:49,960
was taking them to make their online

1083
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:52,319
it's like

1084
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:54,199
seriously anyway if you don't have it

1085
00:46:52,318 --> 00:46:57,239
behind the fence people think it's fair

1086
00:46:54,199 --> 00:46:59,118
game but hid and plain sight is a good

1087
00:46:57,239 --> 00:47:00,838
way to go like if you're still somewhere

1088
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:03,559
where you've got to hide your plants

1089
00:47:00,838 --> 00:47:05,639
that's a great way to go I mean if you

1090
00:47:03,559 --> 00:47:08,000
were in France they don't even allow

1091
00:47:05,639 --> 00:47:10,279
Irrigation in The Vineyards so you'd

1092
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,559
still be out there hand watering but in

1093
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:14,800
in h British Columbia The Vineyard

1094
00:47:12,559 --> 00:47:18,839
wouldn't survive without water you know

1095
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:21,359
not not in the interior in the um in

1096
00:47:18,838 --> 00:47:23,719
Ontario you don't use much irrigation I

1097
00:47:21,358 --> 00:47:27,078
don't think in The Vineyards but if you

1098
00:47:23,719 --> 00:47:29,759
have dir LS out there you got drip lines

1099
00:47:27,079 --> 00:47:31,039
and Tris and cover yeah you're good to

1100
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:33,920
go you

1101
00:47:31,039 --> 00:47:36,719
know I was telling you before the show

1102
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:39,079
that uh a good friend of mine Professor

1103
00:47:36,719 --> 00:47:41,598
p and his buddy solo farms over in

1104
00:47:39,079 --> 00:47:45,359
Massachusetts uh did a preservation of

1105
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:47,400
the grapefruit work and I had a picture

1106
00:47:45,358 --> 00:47:49,119
that I wanted to or it's more of a video

1107
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:51,240
that I wanted to show you really quick

1108
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:54,200
of one that I grew out of that that was

1109
00:47:51,239 --> 00:47:55,838
more leaning towards the sweet pink and

1110
00:47:54,199 --> 00:47:59,118
uh wanted to see if it Beed any

1111
00:47:55,838 --> 00:48:01,960
resemblance to you to the old stuff well

1112
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:01,960
you've got my

1113
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:11,440
attention that's so tiny is there any

1114
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:11,440
way oh let me try and blow

1115
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:16,599
my go back let's see the top

1116
00:48:22,679 --> 00:48:26,279
again go

1117
00:48:24,639 --> 00:48:28,400
down

1118
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:30,760
go down I want to see the stocks of it

1119
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:32,280
oh this is an old video Steve oh it's an

1120
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:35,760
old video I thought you were moving it

1121
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:35,760
around or something sorry

1122
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:41,920
sir yeah it's believable man I think so

1123
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:45,400
it has you know the texture of the

1124
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:46,400
leaves looks like it the shape and size

1125
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:49,119
pretty

1126
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:51,440
much is it starting again you're started

1127
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:51,440
again I

1128
00:48:54,599 --> 00:48:57,599
miss

1129
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:07,599
that's good you did a good job I think

1130
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:08,599
it looks like pretty close it may be a

1131
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:12,838
little

1132
00:49:08,599 --> 00:49:15,280
pointier but not too much it's pretty

1133
00:49:12,838 --> 00:49:17,759
close well that is good to hear man I

1134
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:20,599
will pass on that

1135
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:22,160
news because that was that was the main

1136
00:49:20,599 --> 00:49:24,039
phenotype that you were getting out of

1137
00:49:22,159 --> 00:49:26,199
it was plants that were looking like

1138
00:49:24,039 --> 00:49:27,798
that uh with just that rare one that I

1139
00:49:26,199 --> 00:49:29,879
was telling you about earlier that was a

1140
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:32,000
little bit more sour it was uh a little

1141
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:33,960
bit more potent it leave you a little

1142
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:36,119
bit more head buzzed you know instead of

1143
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:38,318
the up head buzz it was that extreme

1144
00:49:36,119 --> 00:49:41,280
like holy

1145
00:49:38,318 --> 00:49:45,358
[ __ ] and what did they work it

1146
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:48,400
with um as far as I don't want to

1147
00:49:45,358 --> 00:49:51,358
misquote this because I feel like I keep

1148
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:53,079
getting it wrong but I'm pretty sure uh

1149
00:49:51,358 --> 00:49:55,880
Professor P had the one that he called

1150
00:49:53,079 --> 00:49:58,839
the inbred line for the the Great fruit

1151
00:49:55,880 --> 00:50:00,280
and breadline and then uh solo over in

1152
00:49:58,838 --> 00:50:02,358
Massachusetts had the sweet pink

1153
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:04,760
grapefruit and I believe that was from

1154
00:50:02,358 --> 00:50:07,440
your stock I'm not sure I think P

1155
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:09,440
claimed that his was from your stock um

1156
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:11,599
but they took those two that were kind

1157
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:14,079
of unrelated you know that they're both

1158
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:15,640
grapefruit different Coast lines and

1159
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:17,400
they took them together and brought them

1160
00:50:15,639 --> 00:50:20,239
together to kind of open it back up and

1161
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:22,559
preserve it it's got a little rounder

1162
00:50:20,239 --> 00:50:25,639
talk those ones were a little pointier

1163
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:27,519
you know were a little bit pointier they

1164
00:50:25,639 --> 00:50:30,719
don't look exactly like it but it's very

1165
00:50:27,519 --> 00:50:32,838
similar like the type of resin on the

1166
00:50:30,719 --> 00:50:36,879
leaves you know it really looked like

1167
00:50:32,838 --> 00:50:40,000
that kind of Velvet Leaf kind of it's a

1168
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:43,640
neat it was too it was a beautiful plant

1169
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:46,280
and like you said just dead on Ruby Red

1170
00:50:43,639 --> 00:50:48,519
Grapefruit oh yeah delicious and it

1171
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:50,680
yielded really really well too yeah

1172
00:50:48,519 --> 00:50:53,480
they're chunky they're chunky and

1173
00:50:50,679 --> 00:50:55,239
they're tasty and that's what the people

1174
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:56,760
like about I'll tell you a funny story

1175
00:50:55,239 --> 00:50:58,078
actually

1176
00:50:56,760 --> 00:51:00,440
from

1177
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:05,119
um back in

1178
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:08,358
the let's say Lish M to late 90s there

1179
00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:11,798
was a lot of really nice grapefruit and

1180
00:51:08,358 --> 00:51:12,880
Sweet Tooth ending up in New York City

1181
00:51:11,798 --> 00:51:17,079
and they

1182
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:19,519
would they then one time they took some

1183
00:51:17,079 --> 00:51:23,359
different weed that was a lot

1184
00:51:19,519 --> 00:51:26,440
stronger and wasn't as tasty but it was

1185
00:51:23,358 --> 00:51:29,039
stronger and they said the next time

1186
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:31,159
they were back they said we don't want

1187
00:51:29,039 --> 00:51:34,679
the strong one again we have a routine

1188
00:51:31,159 --> 00:51:36,440
we we take take a 100 Kil 100 pounds out

1189
00:51:34,679 --> 00:51:38,798
of storage every morning and break it

1190
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:42,039
down to 10 people they go home that

1191
00:51:38,798 --> 00:51:44,480
afternoon and break it down to 10 people

1192
00:51:42,039 --> 00:51:46,400
they go take their pounds and then they

1193
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:48,639
sell ounces or sell it to the guy

1194
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:51,079
selling ounces to sell eights and stuff

1195
00:51:48,639 --> 00:51:53,078
like that and uh they break it down he

1196
00:51:51,079 --> 00:51:55,960
says the guy comes home from work the

1197
00:51:53,079 --> 00:52:00,079
bike Courier comes over with his 85 $5

1198
00:51:55,960 --> 00:52:01,440
eight you know and it's so tasty they're

1199
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:03,519
just like I have another one it's so

1200
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:05,559
tasty they just did bong rip after bong

1201
00:52:03,519 --> 00:52:07,639
rip because it tastes so good and by

1202
00:52:05,559 --> 00:52:10,160
midnight it's all gone and the next day

1203
00:52:07,639 --> 00:52:12,039
the whole cycle starts over but he said

1204
00:52:10,159 --> 00:52:14,358
when you put the real poton stuff in

1205
00:52:12,039 --> 00:52:17,599
that round it took them two days to

1206
00:52:14,358 --> 00:52:20,480
finish it and it [ __ ] up our

1207
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:23,200
cycle so we don't want the strong stuff

1208
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:25,000
anymore just the tasty stuff cuz people

1209
00:52:23,199 --> 00:52:26,879
smoke it you know they go through it

1210
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,400
really

1211
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:30,960
well that's the cool thing is there's a

1212
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:34,760
type of cannabis for damn near any time

1213
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:36,679
of the day you know yeah sure and okay

1214
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:40,680
that brings up a point I did really want

1215
00:52:36,679 --> 00:52:43,719
to ask you um a lot of breeders that I

1216
00:52:40,679 --> 00:52:46,358
know lay claim that breeding with femin

1217
00:52:43,719 --> 00:52:48,719
seed breeding with s1's um is kind of

1218
00:52:46,358 --> 00:52:51,000
dirtying up the gene pool how do you

1219
00:52:48,719 --> 00:52:55,239
feel about

1220
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:58,199
that well I think over Reliance on S1

1221
00:52:55,239 --> 00:53:00,598
ones who put a lot more Herms out there

1222
00:52:58,199 --> 00:53:02,960
I think so I think

1223
00:53:00,599 --> 00:53:06,880
so

1224
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:09,280
um a I had never been a big fan of them

1225
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:11,480
and I never sold Sam seeds but the

1226
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:13,440
market of course demands them at this

1227
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:17,079
point like it was really just getting to

1228
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:19,720
be crucial around the time I was taking

1229
00:53:17,079 --> 00:53:21,960
a break you know and retired from the

1230
00:53:19,719 --> 00:53:23,919
seed business for 15 years there

1231
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:26,039
whatever now I've been making them for

1232
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:28,680
five plus but I haven't

1233
00:53:26,039 --> 00:53:32,199
got back in the market actually had my

1234
00:53:28,679 --> 00:53:34,598
first hemp seed at one of my companies

1235
00:53:32,199 --> 00:53:38,480
is the first time I ever made a hemp

1236
00:53:34,599 --> 00:53:40,440
seed and it's a a feminized hemp line

1237
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:44,599
and that came out in the fall as a

1238
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:48,559
registered hemp seed and then the next

1239
00:53:44,599 --> 00:53:52,400
registered seed we have coming out that

1240
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:55,559
U is a my company in Colombia that is

1241
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:58,720
it's not just me of course but it's it's

1242
00:53:55,559 --> 00:54:00,960
a a one to one is this something that we

1243
00:53:58,719 --> 00:54:04,558
can look forward to in the future those

1244
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:07,679
are those will be out they're literally

1245
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:09,798
being harvested this week uh I just

1246
00:54:07,679 --> 00:54:12,519
posted a picture I think today actually

1247
00:54:09,798 --> 00:54:15,199
I could I'll post think I shared a

1248
00:54:12,519 --> 00:54:17,559
picture of it on on Twitter maybe but

1249
00:54:15,199 --> 00:54:21,118
that was um this one to one and if

1250
00:54:17,559 --> 00:54:24,440
memory serves that one was a 15 to 15

1251
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:26,559
for THC and CBD and it's a pretty plant

1252
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:29,159
and

1253
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:31,160
hope it hope it's hope people like it

1254
00:54:29,159 --> 00:54:35,598
but it's not it's not spice of life it's

1255
00:54:31,159 --> 00:54:38,759
not you know it's its own brand so that

1256
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:40,680
uh it'll be white labeled like the first

1257
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:43,520
batch coming out the first commercial

1258
00:54:40,679 --> 00:54:45,358
batch won't be an enormous one but now

1259
00:54:43,519 --> 00:54:48,239
it's registered so we'll get those out

1260
00:54:45,358 --> 00:54:51,519
there and get people um see how the

1261
00:54:48,239 --> 00:54:54,159
demand is for them and uh then produce a

1262
00:54:51,519 --> 00:54:57,519
lot more so they can be really

1263
00:54:54,159 --> 00:54:58,838
inexpensive and broadly available well I

1264
00:54:57,519 --> 00:55:01,639
can tell you there's somebody already

1265
00:54:58,838 --> 00:55:03,400
looking forward to that because I really

1266
00:55:01,639 --> 00:55:06,480
enjoy Wonder ones in the morning it's

1267
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:08,599
become like it's been know people like

1268
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:10,559
it's like my morning coffee I mean it

1269
00:55:08,599 --> 00:55:13,559
doesn't get you blasted out of your mind

1270
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:17,040
but it it's a functional lift yeah

1271
00:55:13,559 --> 00:55:20,519
functional lift I've I've tried him of

1272
00:55:17,039 --> 00:55:21,960
course I mean of course but they don't

1273
00:55:20,519 --> 00:55:24,280
really hit me at all like any of the

1274
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:25,679
ratio plants I usually like oh that was

1275
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:29,839
just a waste of r

1276
00:55:25,679 --> 00:55:32,879
then I go you know I I feel like I just

1277
00:55:29,838 --> 00:55:35,719
don't get enough off it to to float my

1278
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:37,440
boat I had one that was neat was said of

1279
00:55:35,719 --> 00:55:39,078
the same I have friends that were

1280
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:41,039
absolutely adored it that they were

1281
00:55:39,079 --> 00:55:43,318
there and they can't smoke the high THC

1282
00:55:41,039 --> 00:55:45,559
stuff and we had some plenty of outdoor

1283
00:55:43,318 --> 00:55:48,358
that was over 30% you know I have Rock

1284
00:55:45,559 --> 00:55:50,480
Solid outdoor down there that can be as

1285
00:55:48,358 --> 00:55:52,920
good as anything out there is absolutely

1286
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:55,240
stunning and if I smoke you know I won't

1287
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:56,760
even reach for the strongest one all the

1288
00:55:55,239 --> 00:55:59,558
time I'll often reach for one of the

1289
00:55:56,760 --> 00:56:02,680
tastier ones that are you know mid 20s

1290
00:55:59,559 --> 00:56:04,519
instead of low3s because the low 30s too

1291
00:56:02,679 --> 00:56:08,210
it's a different smell you know it's not

1292
00:56:04,519 --> 00:56:09,318

1295
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:19,319
they have a very distinct taste but it's

1296
00:56:14,798 --> 00:56:19,318
a lot more AER you know it's

1297

1298
00:56:23,679 --> 00:56:31,239

00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:55,200
that well I I had uh you know my biggest

1327
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:58,839
one of my biggest regrets in of was

1328
00:57:55,199 --> 00:58:00,199
collecting was when I had it pure not

1329
00:57:58,838 --> 00:58:03,798
knowing what it

1330
00:58:00,199 --> 00:58:06,639
was but I had seeds that was gifted to

1331
00:58:03,798 --> 00:58:08,920
me from a friend of a friend who said

1332
00:58:06,639 --> 00:58:11,598
this was the best weed I'd ever smoked

1333
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:14,599
and I was on holidays in Jamaica it was

1334
00:58:11,599 --> 00:58:16,280
golden and sticky and he said the best

1335
00:58:14,599 --> 00:58:18,079
weed I've ever smoked he give it to your

1336
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:20,359
friend Steve he brows great weed give it

1337
00:58:18,079 --> 00:58:22,440
to him see what he can do with it so he

1338
00:58:20,358 --> 00:58:24,119
gave so my friend brought me these seeds

1339
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:26,720
and his name is Lionel so I called it

1340
00:58:24,119 --> 00:58:28,559
lion Lion's killer and then they changed

1341
00:58:26,719 --> 00:58:30,798
the lion killer you know and then that

1342
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:33,720
was what it was grown as it just said LK

1343
00:58:30,798 --> 00:58:36,759
on it for Lion's killer and they and as

1344
00:58:33,719 --> 00:58:38,558
it grew it was growing with all this

1345
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:42,200
other stuff that took on average eight

1346
00:58:38,559 --> 00:58:45,000
weeks and it wasn't flowering you know

1347
00:58:42,199 --> 00:58:47,239
I'm like holy [ __ ] this stuff is so

1348
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:50,119
skinny and so

1349
00:58:47,239 --> 00:58:51,838
slow but it's got a compelling smell

1350
00:58:50,119 --> 00:58:54,440
like if you rub the stock in that and

1351
00:58:51,838 --> 00:58:59,159
the leaves were just pite like really

1352
00:58:54,440 --> 00:59:03,760
really pretty thin and and paler and I

1353
00:58:59,159 --> 00:59:06,118
had um the male and females like I had

1354
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:09,960
two males and two females or something

1355
00:59:06,119 --> 00:59:12,318
it and I said well it's totally

1356
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:13,960
unusual I'm going to leave it the first

1357
00:59:12,318 --> 00:59:15,960
time I just kept the mail away and

1358
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:18,679
didn't do anything with the mail I let

1359
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:19,679
them grow just to have them a sense

1360
00:59:18,679 --> 00:59:22,279
these two

1361
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:24,960
females and I had backup mothers of them

1362
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:29,720
and fathers at the time and I grew them

1363
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:32,720
and I it took 16 weeks to flower and

1364
00:59:29,719 --> 00:59:35,279
they were absolute pencils but they

1365
00:59:32,719 --> 00:59:37,759
smelled like cherry pie filling or

1366
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:39,839
something it was just exotic and so I

1367
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:41,839
had him I packed him into a glass

1368
00:59:39,838 --> 00:59:44,639
spaghetti noodle jar one of the tall

1369
00:59:41,838 --> 00:59:47,078
jars and I packed them in there and I

1370
00:59:44,639 --> 00:59:50,279
guess made it was maybe 2 ounces but

1371
00:59:47,079 --> 00:59:52,760
they were just tiny thin thin Buds and

1372
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:56,200
they took 16 weeks and I didn't share

1373
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:59,640
them with my best friend I didn't

1374
00:59:56,199 --> 01:00:01,519
sh they stayed in my bedroom and I would

1375
00:59:59,639 --> 01:00:03,159
like go up there in the morning wake up

1376
01:00:01,519 --> 01:00:05,960
in the morning and smoke on there before

1377
01:00:03,159 --> 01:00:08,759
I even left my room i'' be like oh this

1378
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:11,000
is this is too good to share you know

1379
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:13,240
and I was like okay this stuff's magical

1380
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:15,480
I have to make some seeds with it but

1381
01:00:13,239 --> 01:00:18,719
instead of making a pure batch and

1382
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:20,400
keeping it pure I said well nobody's

1383
01:00:18,719 --> 01:00:23,838
ever going to want these because they

1384
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:25,519
too skinny and they take too long so

1385
01:00:23,838 --> 01:00:28,199
instead of making in a pure batch which

1386
01:00:25,519 --> 01:00:31,559
I could have easily done cuz at first I

1387
01:00:28,199 --> 01:00:35,000
did the male Santa Marty gold with a

1388
01:00:31,559 --> 01:00:37,760
Dutch Treat which was fast and Frosty

1389
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:40,119
and compact so I crossed it with the

1390
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:42,680
Dutch Treat and that was Tropical Treat

1391
01:00:40,119 --> 01:00:44,880
one and I could have easily put the

1392
01:00:42,679 --> 01:00:47,519
female at the same time and got a pure

1393
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:49,760
batch but I was too stupid and I did the

1394
01:00:47,519 --> 01:00:52,079
female separately and I used the same

1395
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:53,920
male which turned out to be a Northern

1396
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:55,039
Light Haze that was the father of the

1397
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:57,680
sweet sky

1398
01:00:55,039 --> 01:01:00,359
strawberry blonde and some other ones so

1399
01:00:57,679 --> 01:01:02,838
the but that was Tropical Treat number

1400
01:01:00,358 --> 01:01:06,239
two so I had the two lines of those came

1401
01:01:02,838 --> 01:01:07,920
out and uh I had pictures back from

1402
01:01:06,239 --> 01:01:09,759
people growing them in

1403
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:12,798
Australia in

1404
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:15,280
Hawaii just gorgeous and they loved them

1405
01:01:12,798 --> 01:01:18,199
they were raving above and then I I was

1406
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:19,839
like they're still so slow though you

1407
01:01:18,199 --> 01:01:22,239
know and I grew them out to test and I

1408
01:01:19,838 --> 01:01:25,440
like they're still so slow so I cross

1409
01:01:22,239 --> 01:01:28,000
them later with shushu ber and sweet

1410
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:30,599
tooth and called them Tropicana one and

1411
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:32,239
two and I did those in Switzerland but

1412
01:01:30,599 --> 01:01:34,240
when I was growing out the tropical

1413
01:01:32,239 --> 01:01:37,038
treats one and two in

1414
01:01:34,239 --> 01:01:41,118
Switzerland um Sam the scottman came for

1415
01:01:37,039 --> 01:01:45,000
a visit one time and had this really

1416
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:48,519
cool hermetics sealed door to slide open

1417
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:49,239
into the backro and I had 36 lights in

1418
01:01:48,519 --> 01:01:52,759
the

1419
01:01:49,239 --> 01:01:54,879
aquarium and a total selection crop

1420
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:57,039
going on with a huge range of stuff it

1421
01:01:54,880 --> 01:02:00,880
was like my first big seed selection

1422
01:01:57,039 --> 01:02:03,319
right there and Sam came for a visit and

1423
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:05,000
he when we open the door he saw those at

1424
01:02:03,318 --> 01:02:06,960
the back cuz of course they're just

1425
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:08,639
against the wall cuz they take two crops

1426
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:11,798
anyway so you just put them at the back

1427
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:14,078
out of the way and he went Santa Mar

1428
01:02:11,798 --> 01:02:16,639
gold and he just beelined for them you

1429
01:02:14,079 --> 01:02:18,400
know and he's smelling and going this is

1430
01:02:16,639 --> 01:02:19,798
the best Santa Mar gold I've seen in

1431
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:21,798
decades where did you get this and I

1432
01:02:19,798 --> 01:02:23,679
said oh that's crossed down once already

1433
01:02:21,798 --> 01:02:25,559
he's like it's still pretty good I was

1434
01:02:23,679 --> 01:02:27,759
like I know it's really good still but

1435
01:02:25,559 --> 01:02:30,079
it's not we should have seen the parents

1436
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:31,640
you know so I remember the parents like

1437
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:34,200
it was yesterday it was some of my

1438
01:02:31,639 --> 01:02:36,000
favorite herb ever and it's not shocking

1439
01:02:34,199 --> 01:02:38,558
that that's the genetic they had in

1440
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:41,838
Barbados that could have originated out

1441
01:02:38,559 --> 01:02:43,519
of Colombia right so the U even it was

1442
01:02:41,838 --> 01:02:45,639
grown in Barbados which I totally

1443
01:02:43,519 --> 01:02:48,079
believe that nice Limestone beautiful

1444
01:02:45,639 --> 01:02:50,598
place to grow I've seen fantastic B of

1445
01:02:48,079 --> 01:02:52,200
Barbados you can you can grow Dynamite

1446
01:02:50,599 --> 01:02:55,200
down there but the

1447
01:02:52,199 --> 01:02:59,078
uh um

1448
01:02:55,199 --> 01:03:01,838
anyway the the smell on barbad since

1449
01:02:59,079 --> 01:03:05,278
I've been back since I've been back in

1450
01:03:01,838 --> 01:03:07,038
Columbia six years trying to recreate

1451
01:03:05,278 --> 01:03:09,039
you know from every collection I've

1452
01:03:07,039 --> 01:03:12,520
collected Santa Mar gold from you know

1453
01:03:09,039 --> 01:03:16,160
20 different people in 20 different

1454
01:03:12,519 --> 01:03:19,480
places and some lines are closer than

1455
01:03:16,159 --> 01:03:22,719
others and usually I find like okay one

1456
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:26,358
out of 20 is right and the other 19 are

1457
01:03:22,719 --> 01:03:29,239
[ __ ] so I I had to sift through them you

1458
01:03:26,358 --> 01:03:31,598
know and I'm continually doing that but

1459
01:03:29,239 --> 01:03:34,639
I have got some now that I'm pretty

1460
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:37,440
proud of that are getting more and more

1461
01:03:34,639 --> 01:03:38,558
like what I remember it to be and I

1462
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:41,798
actually

1463
01:03:38,559 --> 01:03:44,359
know um some of the families in the

1464
01:03:41,798 --> 01:03:46,920
North Coast that were the people that

1465
01:03:44,358 --> 01:03:48,960
were growing the sand am martic gold and

1466
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:51,440
and they you know they haven't seen it

1467
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:53,880
themselves and I send them pictures of

1468
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:56,119
here look how close this is and and I

1469
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:58,079
know the guys that used to grow it that

1470
01:03:56,119 --> 01:04:00,480
are very old men now they're still

1471
01:03:58,079 --> 01:04:02,119
looking at these pictures and going go

1472
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:05,199
go

1473
01:04:02,119 --> 01:04:08,519
go they're so stoked and and their kids

1474
01:04:05,199 --> 01:04:11,719
have been to see it in that you know

1475
01:04:08,519 --> 01:04:14,559
so I've gone and sat on the tractor like

1476
01:04:11,719 --> 01:04:16,719
in the field where the best Sant Mar

1477
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:19,798
gold supposedly came from you know I've

1478
01:04:16,719 --> 01:04:23,480
been I've been all explored the area of

1479
01:04:19,798 --> 01:04:25,880
the region of pretty you know where it

1480
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:28,079
was best grown there was it was grown

1481
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:30,680
really widely but there was some areas

1482
01:04:28,079 --> 01:04:33,680
that were considered the best zones like

1483
01:04:30,679 --> 01:04:35,719
ponir and burgundy you know like it's

1484
01:04:33,679 --> 01:04:37,679
considered a special place to have it

1485
01:04:35,719 --> 01:04:40,078
you know and that's where that's where

1486
01:04:37,679 --> 01:04:43,598
it was you know developed for x amount

1487
01:04:40,079 --> 01:04:47,920
of years and uh it's a true AR it's

1488
01:04:43,599 --> 01:04:50,599
special I really love I love to get it

1489
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:52,559
you know it's been a real dream of mine

1490
01:04:50,599 --> 01:04:54,559
to really restore it and make it

1491
01:04:52,559 --> 01:04:57,160
available for more people to see and

1492
01:04:54,559 --> 01:05:00,440
experience because it it has these high

1493
01:04:57,159 --> 01:05:05,598
notes that most people haven't really

1494
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:09,679
been exposed to yet you know and Haze is

1495
01:05:05,599 --> 01:05:12,119
as close as most people get and Haze

1496
01:05:09,679 --> 01:05:15,078
original yellow Haze was pure Santa

1497
01:05:12,119 --> 01:05:18,640
Marta gold that climatized in Santa Cruz

1498
01:05:15,079 --> 01:05:22,680
I think but anyway in California and

1499
01:05:18,639 --> 01:05:25,358
um then it became the green Haze when

1500
01:05:22,679 --> 01:05:28,598
somebody guy Michael supposedly added

1501
01:05:25,358 --> 01:05:31,199
the tie into it and it became the green

1502
01:05:28,599 --> 01:05:34,599
Haze is my understanding you I'm sure

1503
01:05:31,199 --> 01:05:36,759
somebody could correct me but that's u

1504
01:05:34,599 --> 01:05:40,440
in that that be along the lines of the

1505
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:42,039
the haze Brothers presumably yeah I

1506
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:44,798
don't know them I've never talked to

1507
01:05:42,039 --> 01:05:47,559
them so I can't say it's all your sa for

1508
01:05:44,798 --> 01:05:49,599
me that's all I'm saying you know so the

1509
01:05:47,559 --> 01:05:52,278
but from pretty good sources like Sam

1510
01:05:49,599 --> 01:05:55,000
the SK fan that I remember what he told

1511
01:05:52,278 --> 01:05:58,159
me about I hope but was pretty simple

1512
01:05:55,000 --> 01:06:00,159
with that the um and it's pretty obvious

1513
01:05:58,159 --> 01:06:01,920
when when you know what's tic gold

1514
01:06:00,159 --> 01:06:03,519
tastes like that that's pretty close to

1515
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:05,720
what Haze tastes like but when you get

1516
01:06:03,519 --> 01:06:09,079
the yellow Haze over the green Haze you

1517
01:06:05,719 --> 01:06:11,639
notice a difference and um like that

1518
01:06:09,079 --> 01:06:15,240
popular Amnesia Haze cut that's out and

1519
01:06:11,639 --> 01:06:17,519
around I've had even the last three

1520
01:06:15,239 --> 01:06:19,759
years in a row is the only one that I've

1521
01:06:17,519 --> 01:06:22,079
continually put three years in a row in

1522
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:24,599
my yard I only I don't keep very many

1523
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:26,278
plants in my yard but a friend had given

1524
01:06:24,599 --> 01:06:28,519
me one it was so good I said oh give me

1525
01:06:26,278 --> 01:06:31,599
a cut of that every year it was so good

1526
01:06:28,519 --> 01:06:35,719
CU it's the closest thing to Santa Marty

1527
01:06:31,599 --> 01:06:38,160
gold that'll finish in the oag you know

1528
01:06:35,719 --> 01:06:40,199
and that's because I do cheater outdoor

1529
01:06:38,159 --> 01:06:43,038
they're totally outdoor but when the

1530
01:06:40,199 --> 01:06:45,199
rains come I pull them under the porch

1531
01:06:43,039 --> 01:06:48,200
which is south facing so they never get

1532
01:06:45,199 --> 01:06:50,879
rained on when they're in flower but

1533
01:06:48,199 --> 01:06:53,318
they still get a half day of sun or

1534
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:55,400
something they don't get it's not the

1535
01:06:53,318 --> 01:06:57,000
it's not comp competitive environment my

1536
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:59,480
backyard because there's shade in the

1537
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:03,079
morning and shade later in the day but

1538
01:06:59,480 --> 01:07:06,159
it gets the best part of the day it gets

1539
01:07:03,079 --> 01:07:08,318
direct sun and it's cooking so they they

1540
01:07:06,159 --> 01:07:10,358
turn out good my backyard plants so I'm

1541
01:07:08,318 --> 01:07:12,558
happy for that it's a hobby thing I

1542
01:07:10,358 --> 01:07:15,078
travel so much so I can't bother having

1543
01:07:12,559 --> 01:07:16,880
an indoor you know I don't even have a

1544
01:07:15,079 --> 01:07:18,278
closet at home it's like plus when

1545
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:20,000
you're home do you want to take your

1546
01:07:18,278 --> 01:07:23,199
work home all the time well of course I

1547
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:24,519
want to smoke at home all the time but I

1548
01:07:23,199 --> 01:07:27,038
I mean uh

1549
01:07:24,519 --> 01:07:29,559
I've got so much her growing in so many

1550
01:07:27,039 --> 01:07:31,400
places but I've got so many skilled

1551
01:07:29,559 --> 01:07:35,319
people working with me and taking care

1552
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:38,079
of it in the dayto day that I've become

1553
01:07:35,318 --> 01:07:40,199
pretty lazy and I feel hands off until I

1554
01:07:38,079 --> 01:07:42,559
have my summer plants where I have my

1555
01:07:40,199 --> 01:07:45,038
personal plants you know and I hashtag

1556
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:47,960
pool Bud on them and I just have a

1557
01:07:45,039 --> 01:07:51,079
little joy for watering them myself you

1558
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:53,559
know rather than having 80 people on the

1559
01:07:51,079 --> 01:07:55,318
farm that you know I'm never watering

1560
01:07:53,559 --> 01:07:56,920
something when I go to the farm I'm

1561
01:07:55,318 --> 01:07:58,960
walking around and making notes and

1562
01:07:56,920 --> 01:08:01,599
talking to people and taking pictures

1563
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:03,358
but I'm not hands on with the plant so

1564
01:08:01,599 --> 01:08:05,559
at least in my backyard I get that

1565
01:08:03,358 --> 01:08:08,159
connection again because I feel like

1566
01:08:05,559 --> 01:08:10,160
I've become too much of an executive

1567
01:08:08,159 --> 01:08:11,798
grower on some level you know even

1568
01:08:10,159 --> 01:08:14,838
executive breeder because I have

1569
01:08:11,798 --> 01:08:17,920
breeders working for me that are far

1570
01:08:14,838 --> 01:08:20,519
more qualified as far as scholastically

1571
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:22,560
speaking but their fruit oute because I

1572
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:24,239
can look at the stem of a male sometimes

1573
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:26,719
and tell them what it is and they like

1574
01:08:24,238 --> 01:08:26,718
that's not

1575
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:32,159
normal so we have really a lot of fun

1576
01:08:29,798 --> 01:08:36,158
working together because they're from

1577
01:08:32,158 --> 01:08:38,719
outside cannabis some of them and it's

1578
01:08:36,158 --> 01:08:40,358
real eye opener for them like and it's

1579
01:08:38,719 --> 01:08:42,279
you know not as easy for me because I

1580
01:08:40,359 --> 01:08:44,359
had to teach them to grow in the first

1581
01:08:42,279 --> 01:08:47,359
place and teach them what to look for

1582
01:08:44,359 --> 01:08:49,920
whereas in other projects you know like

1583
01:08:47,359 --> 01:08:53,400
in the Thailand right now I have Steve

1584
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:55,239
Ryner from potent ponics so he's there

1585
01:08:53,399 --> 01:08:57,158
on the the ground taking care of the

1586
01:08:55,238 --> 01:08:59,000
plants killing the [ __ ] ones taking

1587
01:08:57,158 --> 01:09:01,158
video showing this showing the whole

1588
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:03,640
world how what's going on it's on his

1589
01:09:01,158 --> 01:09:06,399
YouTube channel so I get live

1590
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:08,798
practically live updates from the Farms

1591
01:09:06,399 --> 01:09:12,278
but I get more from the Tai one than

1592
01:09:08,798 --> 01:09:14,838
from the ones in Columbia and in Spain

1593
01:09:12,279 --> 01:09:16,520
they're more research based crops right

1594
01:09:14,838 --> 01:09:21,399
now we have

1595
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:23,279
uh we have EU funding with uh The Bash

1596
01:09:21,399 --> 01:09:25,358
government and then we have another

1597
01:09:23,279 --> 01:09:29,359
project with the Catalan government and

1598
01:09:25,359 --> 01:09:33,239
we do genetic research and propagation

1599
01:09:29,359 --> 01:09:35,560
work micropropagation work to do sematic

1600
01:09:33,238 --> 01:09:37,399
embryogenesis and hopefully eventually

1601
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:40,719
in suspension culture because we do it

1602
01:09:37,399 --> 01:09:43,158
now in in pet dishes but I want to have

1603
01:09:40,719 --> 01:09:44,759
you know the goal was was to do it in

1604
01:09:43,158 --> 01:09:47,238
suspension culture but that's the

1605
01:09:44,759 --> 01:09:52,079
hardest type of tissue culture to

1606
01:09:47,238 --> 01:09:54,359
do um anyways we're on it because like

1607
01:09:52,079 --> 01:09:56,960
with sterile plants you can't I can't

1608
01:09:54,359 --> 01:09:59,439
make seeds for stero plants but I can

1609
01:09:56,960 --> 01:10:01,679
make cuting of my sterile plants so

1610
01:09:59,439 --> 01:10:04,238
those are at no risk of Ever Getting

1611
01:10:01,679 --> 01:10:07,279
seeded and they root in three or four

1612
01:10:04,238 --> 01:10:11,198
days so they're amazing plants and I can

1613
01:10:07,279 --> 01:10:13,920
do that with just about any plant so I'm

1614
01:10:11,198 --> 01:10:16,759
as I get the different selections

1615
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:19,158
sterile then we'll get them registered

1616
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:21,480
and then hopefully distribute those as

1617
01:10:19,158 --> 01:10:24,519
artificial seeds or synthetic

1618
01:10:21,479 --> 01:10:26,079
seeds they'll be fun it's just

1619
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:27,640
scared when you people get scared when

1620
01:10:26,079 --> 01:10:29,439
you say that you know because they think

1621
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:31,760
you're doing GMO or something and it's

1622
01:10:29,439 --> 01:10:35,319
not like that it's just just a

1623
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:36,480
convenient way to ship micropropagation

1624
01:10:35,319 --> 01:10:39,880
you

1625
01:10:36,479 --> 01:10:42,359
know yeah absolutely so to round back

1626
01:10:39,880 --> 01:10:43,840
really quick would you say that Amnesia

1627
01:10:42,359 --> 01:10:47,839
Haze was one of your

1628
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:50,560
favorites oh no that you know lately

1629
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:52,880
okay I could say of backyard stuff

1630
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:55,080
that's been a nice one the Amnesia Haze

1631
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:59,920
this summer I had a

1632
01:10:55,079 --> 01:11:04,079
creamsicle um pie hole chem glue

1633
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:06,760
Grandpa's breath what else God bud not

1634
01:11:04,079 --> 01:11:09,000
my favorite is God bud is a neat plant

1635
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:11,840
because it has some really strong like

1636
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:14,198
mildew resistance it has a nice chunky

1637
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:16,760
Frosty appearance but it doesn't have

1638
01:11:14,198 --> 01:11:18,439
any flavor you know there's and I don't

1639
01:11:16,760 --> 01:11:20,520
get any buzz from it so I was like it

1640
01:11:18,439 --> 01:11:24,158
was very disappointing because it looks

1641
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:27,400
so good but it's just it just looks good

1642
01:11:24,158 --> 01:11:30,039
so looks can be deceiving people I I'm

1643
01:11:27,399 --> 01:11:32,439
I'm often skeptical of super Frosty

1644
01:11:30,039 --> 01:11:34,399
stuff that it's going to be super tasty

1645
01:11:32,439 --> 01:11:36,759
because I've had so many super Frosty

1646
01:11:34,399 --> 01:11:38,719
stuff that was a real let down and that

1647
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:40,920
the first time I saw that was White

1648
01:11:38,719 --> 01:11:43,000
Widow where I remember thinking oh this

1649
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:45,319
looks I saw it when it first came out of

1650
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:48,119
the first can of his cup and Scott

1651
01:11:45,319 --> 01:11:50,039
Blakey there Shanty BBA was there with a

1652
01:11:48,119 --> 01:11:51,800
live plant a white widow and a live

1653
01:11:50,039 --> 01:11:53,560
plant a white rhino and I remember you

1654
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:54,600
know respectfully looking at him not

1655
01:11:53,560 --> 01:11:56,520
touching them and squeezing them to

1656
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:58,480
smell it seeing how close I could get

1657
01:11:56,520 --> 01:12:00,760
without touching to try and smell them

1658
01:11:58,479 --> 01:12:02,678
wasn't a lot coming off and then later I

1659
01:12:00,760 --> 01:12:04,400
see the frosty Bud for sale in the

1660
01:12:02,679 --> 01:12:07,359
coffee shop say would better buy and try

1661
01:12:04,399 --> 01:12:09,519
some and super Frosty but I'm like

1662
01:12:07,359 --> 01:12:11,279
[ __ ] tastes like hay you know and the

1663
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:14,239
buzz was five minutes and I'm just like

1664
01:12:11,279 --> 01:12:17,479
this is this is useless so and I started

1665
01:12:14,238 --> 01:12:21,039
looking at these frostier ones often

1666
01:12:17,479 --> 01:12:22,879
under the loop with the measuring scale

1667
01:12:21,039 --> 01:12:24,880
and they would have very small heads and

1668
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:27,440
if you started making hash with them

1669
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:30,239
you'd find you get more small heads in

1670
01:12:27,439 --> 01:12:31,799
some of these like more 45 and 73 or

1671
01:12:30,238 --> 01:12:36,198
whatnot

1672
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:39,840
and under the scope they have very long

1673
01:12:36,198 --> 01:12:42,638
stocks like the gland stocks right so

1674
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:44,880
you when you separate it into screens

1675
01:12:42,639 --> 01:12:48,520
you go damn I've got more stocks than

1676
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:51,239
heads like if you just you know used a

1677
01:12:48,520 --> 01:12:53,159
single screen and packed your ke you

1678
01:12:51,238 --> 01:12:56,319
know and you're happy with that kind of

1679
01:12:53,158 --> 01:12:59,599
be great hash and that's what it is but

1680
01:12:56,319 --> 01:13:01,880
the but the there's a lot of the

1681
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:04,400
Glitters that is not gold you know often

1682
01:13:01,880 --> 01:13:06,639
the biggest heads with the tastiest

1683
01:13:04,399 --> 01:13:08,519
resin they're spread out on the leaf

1684
01:13:06,639 --> 01:13:10,840
they got short stocks because all the

1685
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:13,000
Energy's gone into the head rather than

1686
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:15,199
the stalks and when when you get those

1687
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:17,198
long fuzzy stalks when you get there

1688
01:13:15,198 --> 01:13:19,599
with a microscope and look at them the

1689
01:13:17,198 --> 01:13:21,678
heads are really tiny on them you know

1690
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:23,760
but the buds in the naked eye it looks

1691
01:13:21,679 --> 01:13:26,158
just white I equivalate that I grew up

1692
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:28,520
in a agricultural environment mostly

1693
01:13:26,158 --> 01:13:31,399
like apples cherries pears things like

1694
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:33,760
this but when you give that fruit when

1695
01:13:31,399 --> 01:13:36,119
you go through and you thin a you know a

1696
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:38,639
bunch of pairs then the rest of them

1697
01:13:36,119 --> 01:13:40,279
have more room to grow bigger and I've

1698
01:13:38,639 --> 01:13:41,600
seen that same thing that you're talking

1699
01:13:40,279 --> 01:13:43,319
about right there with the resin

1700
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:45,520
populations if they have more room to

1701
01:13:43,319 --> 01:13:49,198
grow they usually

1702
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:51,239
do favorites California Orange I always

1703
01:13:49,198 --> 01:13:53,839
like that if it was you had a really

1704
01:13:51,238 --> 01:13:57,000
good one there was an old one that was

1705
01:13:53,840 --> 01:14:00,840
absolutely smack orange like just crazy

1706
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:02,439
good and uh that one was really special

1707
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:05,800
what were some of the other

1708
01:14:02,439 --> 01:14:08,719
ones I I like the real Romulan it was a

1709
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:11,400
[ __ ] for growing because it had very

1710
01:14:08,719 --> 01:14:15,679
bad MW tolerance it was very susceptible

1711
01:14:11,399 --> 01:14:18,479
to mildew and uh it was notoriously bad

1712
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:21,000
for it that one but it was Punchy and it

1713
01:14:18,479 --> 01:14:24,599
smelled like the urinal pucks like it

1714
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:26,198
had that piny smell like a urinal PU

1715
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:27,639
I always I could never think of anything

1716
01:14:26,198 --> 01:14:29,198
else that it smelled like I'm like oh

1717
01:14:27,639 --> 01:14:31,560
it's real ramula that smells like a

1718
01:14:29,198 --> 01:14:33,439
urinal pck you know but anytime

1719
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:37,039
somebody's brought me Romulan like in

1720
01:14:33,439 --> 01:14:39,319
the last 15 years nothing like it like

1721
01:14:37,039 --> 01:14:41,600
it says Romulan but it's nothing like it

1722
01:14:39,319 --> 01:14:43,679
you know I haven't seen a real one in a

1723
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:46,600
long time I'm sure they're out there but

1724
01:14:43,679 --> 01:14:49,679
I just haven't uh I don't go out looking

1725
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:51,800
for weed as you might imagine and uh

1726
01:14:49,679 --> 01:14:54,000
whatever rolls through rolls through

1727
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:56,000
that you know I get a lot from friends

1728
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:59,560
that share with me and I try and share

1729
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:01,760
some of mine that I've grown to it's

1730
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:03,960
I've been doing it long enough that I if

1731
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:07,679
I stopped growing my own right now I

1732
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:10,039
think I could get by on rosin and Bud in

1733
01:15:07,679 --> 01:15:13,239
my fridge I have a separate fridge and

1734
01:15:10,039 --> 01:15:16,000
freezer for personal and I've got jars

1735
01:15:13,238 --> 01:15:18,599
in the you know racks of jars in my wine

1736
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:22,198
Celler wi and wheat cell I think I could

1737
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:24,320
probably stay high for about 15

1738
01:15:22,198 --> 01:15:26,799
years

1739
01:15:24,319 --> 01:15:30,039
yeah

1740
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:33,400
Lally like pounds pounds of rosin or

1741
01:15:30,039 --> 01:15:35,639
sift that are all Frozen because I I'll

1742
01:15:33,399 --> 01:15:38,679
often just turn the plants right into

1743
01:15:35,639 --> 01:15:40,760
Ash right away and and I like to cure

1744
01:15:38,679 --> 01:15:42,239
them too so then I'll wrap them up and

1745
01:15:40,760 --> 01:15:44,560
put them away for a while because I'm

1746
01:15:42,238 --> 01:15:47,519
smoking the ones I grew five years ago

1747
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:50,840
you know so I love hash I'm a big hash

1748
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:52,920
fan I got to say I I did want to ask you

1749
01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:53,840
about that you know coming up and you

1750
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:55,960
know

1751
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:59,639
I imagine back then you guys weren't

1752
01:15:55,960 --> 01:16:01,359
getting as much hash um in Canada yeah

1753
01:15:59,639 --> 01:16:04,159
maybe it wasn't special it wasn't

1754
01:16:01,359 --> 01:16:06,399
special it was we we did get Hash Hash

1755
01:16:04,158 --> 01:16:09,439
was amongst the first things we ever had

1756
01:16:06,399 --> 01:16:11,599
actually and it was uh usually it was

1757
01:16:09,439 --> 01:16:14,198
Lebanese blunder red there's a big

1758
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:16,639
Lebanese community in our town we had

1759
01:16:14,198 --> 01:16:18,599
Lebanese we had Pakistani which they

1760
01:16:16,639 --> 01:16:21,239
called Afghani but we all knew was

1761
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:24,239
Pakistani and that had the gold mascara

1762
01:16:21,238 --> 01:16:27,359
on it and that came wrapped in that red

1763
01:16:24,238 --> 01:16:29,799
plastic like guda cheese and there was a

1764
01:16:27,359 --> 01:16:31,880
wrap Hash Hash cutting and wrapping

1765
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:35,039
Factory in Holland that all of that hash

1766
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:36,880
used to come from so that's kind of a

1767
01:16:35,039 --> 01:16:38,639
that was you know the bulk of what

1768
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:43,520
Canada smoked for a long time was that

1769
01:16:38,639 --> 01:16:46,679
red WRA gold seal and um from that we

1770
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:51,040
started to get occasional brick weed

1771
01:16:46,679 --> 01:16:54,000
from Mexico or Jamaica and a lot a lot

1772
01:16:51,039 --> 01:16:56,359
of Jamaican green oil and you knew it

1773
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:58,359
was Jamaican green oil and not local

1774
01:16:56,359 --> 01:17:01,119
green oil because you could really taste

1775
01:16:58,359 --> 01:17:04,920
the overproof rum they made it with you

1776
01:17:01,119 --> 01:17:07,519
know and yeah I knew the I actually knew

1777
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:11,880
these guys they were friends of one of

1778
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:12,960
my friends older brothers and they got

1779
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:15,560
taken

1780
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:17,319
down this was a crazy story I'll tell

1781
01:17:15,560 --> 01:17:21,639
you because it's the guy's dead now and

1782
01:17:17,319 --> 01:17:24,119
I think it doesn't matter but the he uh

1783
01:17:21,639 --> 01:17:26,920
these young guys they went to Saunders

1784
01:17:24,119 --> 01:17:28,519
High School London Ontario and they they

1785
01:17:26,920 --> 01:17:30,079
were dealing there and when they were

1786
01:17:28,520 --> 01:17:32,159
about to graduate and they thought we

1787
01:17:30,079 --> 01:17:35,079
need to scale up our game we're bring

1788
01:17:32,158 --> 01:17:37,799
we're selling so much dop around town so

1789
01:17:35,079 --> 01:17:39,880
they they went to Jamaica and they took

1790
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:42,679
a bunch of cash and they took a bunch of

1791
01:17:39,880 --> 01:17:45,199
hookers from Miami and they threw a big

1792
01:17:42,679 --> 01:17:48,399
party for the rude boys and took the top

1793
01:17:45,198 --> 01:17:50,879
two floors of some hotel in mono Bay and

1794
01:17:48,399 --> 01:17:54,000
they had an arrangement then that they

1795
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:57,039
would get they would have a gy Jamaican

1796
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:59,319
crew that did the bathrooms and the

1797
01:17:57,039 --> 01:18:04,039
planes like the plane Crews would go in

1798
01:17:59,319 --> 01:18:07,158
and fill up bags of oil under the sinks

1799
01:18:04,039 --> 01:18:09,840
and then put the seal them back up and

1800
01:18:07,158 --> 01:18:12,000
then the Jamaican ground crew in Toronto

1801
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:15,199
would unload them and they did it for a

1802
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:16,719
few years and then the way they got

1803
01:18:15,198 --> 01:18:21,479
caught

1804
01:18:16,719 --> 01:18:25,800
was this guy um he was out he was like

1805
01:18:21,479 --> 01:18:28,638
21 22 years old has a big yacht having a

1806
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:31,279
big party with all these rockers on it

1807
01:18:28,639 --> 01:18:33,279
you know guys and girls and it's all

1808
01:18:31,279 --> 01:18:36,559
crank and Black Sabbath or whatever we

1809
01:18:33,279 --> 01:18:40,238
listening to back then I was a teenager

1810
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:44,639
and these guys were like 22 and they

1811
01:18:40,238 --> 01:18:46,519
and they got caught in a fishing net it

1812
01:18:44,639 --> 01:18:49,920
was like a lost fishing net they got

1813
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:54,840
tangled up and they were way way out in

1814
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:58,039
Lake Huron and this one girl was on acid

1815
01:18:54,840 --> 01:18:59,800
and she grabbed the radio when the guys

1816
01:18:58,039 --> 01:19:02,399
were diving off the back trying to cut

1817
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:05,719
off the net she gets on the radio mayday

1818
01:19:02,399 --> 01:19:07,439
mayday we're singing and then the Coast

1819
01:19:05,719 --> 01:19:08,960
Guard and police and everything show up

1820
01:19:07,439 --> 01:19:11,960
and they're like is this your dad's

1821
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:15,960
yacht and he's like no this is my yacht

1822
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:17,760
you know like and you are you know so

1823
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:19,399
then they looked into him and they took

1824
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:21,639
the whole thing

1825
01:19:19,399 --> 01:19:24,079
down that's where we used to get our

1826
01:19:21,639 --> 01:19:26,719
Jamaican green oil

1827
01:19:24,079 --> 01:19:28,840
back in the day when there is no more

1828
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:31,679
spice Al life when Steve's not around

1829
01:19:28,840 --> 01:19:34,039
anymore what do you want people to

1830
01:19:31,679 --> 01:19:35,880
remember when they think of you that's a

1831
01:19:34,039 --> 01:19:38,158
really hard question what do you want to

1832
01:19:35,880 --> 01:19:39,600
represent all the work you put into

1833
01:19:38,158 --> 01:19:43,000
cannabis to

1834
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:43,000
dat I don't

1835
01:19:44,719 --> 01:19:50,960
know I don't know it's a really tough

1836
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:53,800
one you know if uh I feel like I'm just

1837
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:55,880
getting started at it still and I hope I

1838
01:19:53,800 --> 01:19:58,000
can put out some much better work than I

1839
01:19:55,880 --> 01:20:00,480
ever have yet you know so I feel like

1840
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:02,439
it's far from done but I would love to

1841
01:20:00,479 --> 01:20:06,399
be remembered as you know competent

1842
01:20:02,439 --> 01:20:08,559
breeder I suppose not that um like I

1843
01:20:06,399 --> 01:20:10,198
more than that maybe as a decent person

1844
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:14,199
but maybe

1845
01:20:10,198 --> 01:20:14,198
not that's a tough one too

1846
01:20:14,238 --> 01:20:20,559
so I don't know man I don't that's

1847
01:20:18,079 --> 01:20:22,399
probably one of my favorite I've

1848
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:23,880
remember me as a good golfer that's for

1849
01:20:22,399 --> 01:20:25,559
sure

1850
01:20:23,880 --> 01:20:27,880
and yeah like I said that's probably one

1851
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:30,239
of the best most humble answers that

1852
01:20:27,880 --> 01:20:32,639
I've ever heard to that that's that's

1853
01:20:30,238 --> 01:20:34,359

01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:07,920

1873
01:21:18,920 --> 01:21:23,960
Coast versus West Coast Canada in

1874
01:21:20,840 --> 01:21:26,119
northern BC hash became

1875
01:21:23,960 --> 01:21:29,198
hash maybe came to town twice a year and

1876
01:21:26,119 --> 01:21:32,158
was $20 a grand

1877
01:21:29,198 --> 01:21:33,158
[ __ ] yeah onario we didn't see much

1878
01:21:32,158 --> 01:21:37,198
grass

1879
01:21:33,158 --> 01:21:41,879
until well the late 80s I think was the

1880
01:21:37,198 --> 01:21:41,879
first time I saw Northern Lights it have

1881
01:21:42,279 --> 01:21:50,519
been yeah 86 87 maybe the first time I

1882
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:52,920
saw Northern Lights and there was um I

1883
01:21:50,520 --> 01:21:55,840
had some grown in rock wull indoors and

1884
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:58,679
I'd had some grown in fields outside and

1885
01:21:55,840 --> 01:22:03,760
the guys that did Fields outside three

1886
01:21:58,679 --> 01:22:07,239
guys did 700 pounds of it by paying a

1887
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:09,560
farmer with Bean fields to let him put

1888
01:22:07,238 --> 01:22:12,319
in small plants late in the season and

1889
01:22:09,560 --> 01:22:14,800
do like 20,000 little plants and then

1890
01:22:12,319 --> 01:22:16,279
they pay the bean farmer 10 grand to be

1891
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:18,600
out there and the cops are looking all

1892
01:22:16,279 --> 01:22:20,399
over the corn fields and everybody's

1893
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:22,239
driving by the bean Fields because

1894
01:22:20,399 --> 01:22:24,519
they're only knee high and nobody grows

1895
01:22:22,238 --> 01:22:26,198
weed beans right smart asit so that's

1896
01:22:24,520 --> 01:22:29,120
that's how you know people tuck them

1897
01:22:26,198 --> 01:22:31,000
into crops to pull it off and the bean

1898
01:22:29,119 --> 01:22:32,920
moves a sweet one because they'll be

1899
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:34,238
looking at all the fields except those

1900
01:22:32,920 --> 01:22:36,119
because they think they're too short for

1901
01:22:34,238 --> 01:22:38,319
weed but of course now I've given out

1902
01:22:36,119 --> 01:22:40,760
the secret and nobody can ever get away

1903
01:22:38,319 --> 01:22:40,759
with it

1904
01:22:41,439 --> 01:22:45,960
again no but really because if you if

1905
01:22:44,359 --> 01:22:48,158
you can be out in the field with the

1906
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:50,079
tractor and trailer people can drive by

1907
01:22:48,158 --> 01:22:52,039
nobody's going to think anything it

1908
01:22:50,079 --> 01:22:54,359
you're working in broad daylight and

1909
01:22:52,039 --> 01:22:57,880
they would just be taking a post hole

1910
01:22:54,359 --> 01:23:00,559
diggers and drilling the hole dumping in

1911
01:22:57,880 --> 01:23:03,039
the soil mix coming you know following

1912
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:05,000
along with the clones and they'd be

1913
01:23:03,039 --> 01:23:07,679
tossing them in late so they just grow

1914
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:09,238
up a nice poo stick and that's it so

1915
01:23:07,679 --> 01:23:12,639
they when they were bringing them to us

1916
01:23:09,238 --> 01:23:14,279
to sell we get like 20 pounds of tops we

1917
01:23:12,639 --> 01:23:16,319
didn't know at first you where the hell

1918
01:23:14,279 --> 01:23:18,439
they were growing them or anything but

1919
01:23:16,319 --> 01:23:21,399
first I remember me and a friend we

1920
01:23:18,439 --> 01:23:23,158
split they fronted us like 20 pounds to

1921
01:23:21,399 --> 01:23:27,119
flip so we

1922
01:23:23,158 --> 01:23:29,000
we're teenagers and we okay so we said

1923
01:23:27,119 --> 01:23:30,760
we better start putting some into bags

1924
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:32,800
it's all in garbage bags so we start

1925
01:23:30,760 --> 01:23:34,960
pulling out the and we're like man this

1926
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:37,760
look at the size of this top I'm going

1927
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:40,239
to take this little crown of cix's off

1928
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:42,880
it with no stem or leaf and they call it

1929
01:23:40,238 --> 01:23:44,559
the tip top you know cuz at first we

1930
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:46,520
were like oh look at these giant tops

1931
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:48,760
well we'll keep the big tops for us and

1932
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:50,440
we'll just sell the small buds because

1933
01:23:48,760 --> 01:23:54,239
we were only selling it to get free

1934
01:23:50,439 --> 01:23:56,000
smoke so we would uh

1935
01:23:54,238 --> 01:23:58,599
we would first pull out the big buds and

1936
01:23:56,000 --> 01:24:00,760
then we realized damn 80% of it's all

1937
01:23:58,600 --> 01:24:02,960
these big buds like it's all big buds

1938
01:24:00,760 --> 01:24:04,560
there's very few little buds so that's

1939
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:06,480
when I started saying well I'm clipping

1940
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:09,080
a few tip Toops and just took like a

1941
01:24:06,479 --> 01:24:13,439
couple crowns so I had like a half ounce

1942
01:24:09,079 --> 01:24:16,600
bag that was just kx's really but the uh

1943
01:24:13,439 --> 01:24:18,879
that made a damaging pan of brownies for

1944
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:23,679
a Hamilton Grateful Dead show that my

1945
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:25,359
uncle cop ate that's a whole other story

1946
01:24:23,679 --> 01:24:28,560
that's something that I definitely want

1947
01:24:25,359 --> 01:24:31,000
to hear manzy [ __ ] we'll have to get you

1948
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:33,239
on the podcast another time here in the

1949
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:35,520
future whenever I know you're a busy man

1950
01:24:33,238 --> 01:24:38,198
but uh I want to thank you again for all

1951
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:41,679
the time that you took for this really

1952
01:24:38,198 --> 01:24:44,118
quick before we get going Jesse James 36

1953
01:24:41,679 --> 01:24:46,279
says which strains of yours give the

1954
01:24:44,118 --> 01:24:49,000
most couch locked effect in your

1955
01:24:46,279 --> 01:24:51,359
experience I think of the all of the

1956
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:53,800
ones that I released was probably the

1957
01:24:51,359 --> 01:24:57,359
Louie Legends ultimate

1958
01:24:53,800 --> 01:24:59,760
indicia that was a real you know sit

1959
01:24:57,359 --> 01:25:03,198
down and relax kind of joint you know

1960
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:04,600
that mainly the hash from that it I

1961
01:25:03,198 --> 01:25:06,079
remember one of my friends called it the

1962
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:09,880
black of black because it was like

1963
01:25:06,079 --> 01:25:13,039
blacker than black it was and that was

1964
01:25:09,880 --> 01:25:15,239
when when I had a sizable crop of that I

1965
01:25:13,039 --> 01:25:19,479
found it to I had other things too but I

1966
01:25:15,238 --> 01:25:21,718
found it far preferable for ash over

1967
01:25:19,479 --> 01:25:23,319
grapefruit but maybe not as much as

1968
01:25:21,719 --> 01:25:25,279
Shish

1969
01:25:23,319 --> 01:25:28,439
you know shushu ber is a dynamite hash

1970
01:25:25,279 --> 01:25:31,039
plant too but they make a different hash

1971
01:25:28,439 --> 01:25:35,399
uh yeah I would say coach loock probably

1972
01:25:31,039 --> 01:25:38,960
the Louis Orga Inda by sweet too BX

1973
01:25:35,399 --> 01:25:40,960
2p1 he Co Stone stew says star struct I

1974
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:43,000
can't think of a question but can you

1975
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:44,279
let him know that grapefruit was the

1976
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:47,118
first thing that I ever smoked in

1977
01:25:44,279 --> 01:25:49,519
northern BC that smelled sweet and had a

1978
01:25:47,118 --> 01:25:51,279
high that didn't make me nonfunctional

1979
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:53,920
made me truly fall in love with the

1980
01:25:51,279 --> 01:25:56,198
plant very on very on I'm glad you

1981
01:25:53,920 --> 01:25:57,760
enjoyed it and Jesse James from

1982
01:25:56,198 --> 01:25:59,519
Australia wants to know what's in the

1983
01:25:57,760 --> 01:26:03,440
cards for the

1984
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:06,760
future well to keep

1985
01:26:03,439 --> 01:26:10,439
uh doing these satellite projects I've

1986
01:26:06,760 --> 01:26:13,360
got going I've got the opportunity to

1987
01:26:10,439 --> 01:26:15,960
test cannabis in more environments than

1988
01:26:13,359 --> 01:26:19,880
I ever thought I would so I want to just

1989
01:26:15,960 --> 01:26:23,520
keep at that and develop based on what I

1990
01:26:19,880 --> 01:26:26,520
find there's a I'm not getting bored

1991
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:29,679
with it I'm totally just getting into it

1992
01:26:26,520 --> 01:26:32,159
and getting to do it on like a level

1993
01:26:29,679 --> 01:26:34,199
that I never had dreamt of you know

1994
01:26:32,158 --> 01:26:36,238
probably even 15 years ago I probably

1995
01:26:34,198 --> 01:26:40,439
never thought oh my God this I'm going

1996
01:26:36,238 --> 01:26:43,319
to have the ability to test stuff in 11

1997
01:26:40,439 --> 01:26:47,039
climactic zones in Colombia plus two in

1998
01:26:43,319 --> 01:26:50,158
Thailand and one in Jamaica we've got

1999
01:26:47,039 --> 01:26:51,639
three locations in Spain you know that

2000
01:26:50,158 --> 01:26:54,920
quite different environment from the

2001
01:26:51,639 --> 01:26:58,440
bass country to Catalia down to Al Maria

2002
01:26:54,920 --> 01:27:00,440
so there's getting to see all the plants

2003
01:26:58,439 --> 01:27:04,638
and all the different environments is

2004
01:27:00,439 --> 01:27:07,118
really satisfying for me and uh seeing

2005
01:27:04,639 --> 01:27:10,000
what I can pull together out of them is

2006
01:27:07,118 --> 01:27:12,319
is really a joy you know so I like to

2007
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:15,118
think now that I'm planting seed

2008
01:27:12,319 --> 01:27:17,519
companies and you know planting cannabis

2009
01:27:15,118 --> 01:27:20,000
research stations not just seeds you

2010
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:21,880
know because I'm training people you

2011
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:25,000
know and spending years on training

2012
01:27:21,880 --> 01:27:27,639
people people to make the selections

2013
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:29,359
when I can't you know and when when I

2014
01:27:27,639 --> 01:27:31,639
just can't make it or when I'll never be

2015
01:27:29,359 --> 01:27:33,439
able to again you know so i' love to

2016
01:27:31,639 --> 01:27:36,800
work with the people and I really want

2017
01:27:33,439 --> 01:27:39,439
to try and Inspire and train as many

2018
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:42,159
people as I can and as many places as I

2019
01:27:39,439 --> 01:27:45,000
can to just keep pushing the envelope

2020
01:27:42,158 --> 01:27:46,719
with it and make selections from big

2021
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:48,719
numbers and I know a lot of breeders

2022
01:27:46,719 --> 01:27:50,719
think that you know High number

2023
01:27:48,719 --> 01:27:53,679
selections are outdated now that you

2024
01:27:50,719 --> 01:27:55,840
have molecular genetics Labs on the

2025
01:27:53,679 --> 01:27:58,319
other hand if you don't have fields to

2026
01:27:55,840 --> 01:28:01,560
test them what good is it you know the

2027
01:27:58,319 --> 01:28:03,679
real world testing is you know I I'm not

2028
01:28:01,560 --> 01:28:06,320
knocking the labs I love having access

2029
01:28:03,679 --> 01:28:11,079
to the modern Labs that we do but it's

2030
01:28:06,319 --> 01:28:13,880
it's the um the being in a blue sky with

2031
01:28:11,079 --> 01:28:16,479
a green field there's no substitute you

2032
01:28:13,880 --> 01:28:19,359
know it's I I feel like I'm in church

2033
01:28:16,479 --> 01:28:21,079
when I'm in those fields selecting and

2034
01:28:19,359 --> 01:28:23,920
that's where I'm go off to next week I'm

2035
01:28:21,079 --> 01:28:27,679
down to back to the equator and I have

2036
01:28:23,920 --> 01:28:29,840
375 lines ready to look through from

2037
01:28:27,679 --> 01:28:32,359
some of them from quite High numbers and

2038
01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:33,560
uh I've really been looking forward to

2039
01:28:32,359 --> 01:28:36,719
that for

2040
01:28:33,560 --> 01:28:38,400
years and I'm stoked yeah that's great

2041
01:28:36,719 --> 01:28:42,079
once I get back from there I'll be

2042
01:28:38,399 --> 01:28:43,920
planning this next trip to go to Jamaica

2043
01:28:42,079 --> 01:28:45,198
and as soon as I'm back from Jamaica

2044
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:47,199
I'll be back to

2045
01:28:45,198 --> 01:28:50,198
Thailand and

2046
01:28:47,198 --> 01:28:53,479
uh then we'll see I haven't I've haven't

2047
01:28:50,198 --> 01:28:55,519
been to Spain in just over year now the

2048
01:28:53,479 --> 01:28:58,319
people that are there doing a good job

2049
01:28:55,520 --> 01:29:01,800
you know I don't I'm not needed for you

2050
01:28:58,319 --> 01:29:03,759
know dayt day you know so it's if things

2051
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:05,639
are going good and I'm getting reports

2052
01:29:03,760 --> 01:29:07,639
of healthy plants and everything's on

2053
01:29:05,639 --> 01:29:11,560
track that's what I want to see you know

2054
01:29:07,639 --> 01:29:14,639
I can I'm I'm not micromanaging any one

2055
01:29:11,560 --> 01:29:17,280
site but I'm I'm getting a bird's eye

2056
01:29:14,639 --> 01:29:19,039
view of all of them and just keeping my

2057
01:29:17,279 --> 01:29:20,960
finger on the pulse I love it half of

2058
01:29:19,039 --> 01:29:22,840
it's WhatsApp groups where I've got

2059
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:25,319
WhatsApp groups and send me photos when

2060
01:29:22,840 --> 01:29:29,639
I wake up in the morning I'm in the last

2061
01:29:25,319 --> 01:29:33,000
time zone so so Thailand's 15 hours

2062
01:29:29,639 --> 01:29:37,359
ahead then the European Mainland then

2063
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:41,039
some UK business then the the Colombian

2064
01:29:37,359 --> 01:29:45,118
time and same as Jamaica and then it's

2065
01:29:41,039 --> 01:29:46,679
uh up to me so by noon I've talked to

2066
01:29:45,118 --> 01:29:49,439

2067
01:29:46,679 --> 01:29:51,639
growing weed with me you know by noon

2068
01:29:49,439 --> 01:29:54,238
every day I'm done you know because I've

2069
01:29:51,639 --> 01:29:57,000
started started at 5: in the morning and

2070
01:29:54,238 --> 01:29:59,079
not not every day you know but lots of

2071
01:29:57,000 --> 01:30:01,359
days and it's partly because we're just

2072
01:29:59,079 --> 01:30:03,399
having fun like they don't necessarily I

2073
01:30:01,359 --> 01:30:05,559
don't necessarily need a picture every

2074
01:30:03,399 --> 01:30:07,238
day of every plant but if my friends

2075

fs you know so that's I feel like I'm

2085
01:30:26,319 --> 01:30:30,439
getting the away with something that I

2086
01:30:27,639 --> 01:30:33,118
can just stay home ripping dabs in my

2087
01:30:30,439 --> 01:30:34,839
pajamas and grow weed all over the world

2088
01:30:33,118 --> 01:30:36,759
and then if I get to show up and take

2089
01:30:34,840 --> 01:30:37,880
credit for it once in a while that's fun

2090
01:30:36,760 --> 01:30:40,400
too

2091
01:30:37,880 --> 01:30:43,359
right no I like to get there in person

2092
01:30:40,399 --> 01:30:45,519
and try some and taste some you know the

2093
01:30:43,359 --> 01:30:47,000
uh there's no substitute and of course

2094
01:30:45,520 --> 01:30:49,119
there's some of the places that does

2095
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:50,439
require a lot of training but when I've

2096
01:30:49,118 --> 01:30:53,359
been able to

2097
01:30:50,439 --> 01:30:56,799
install um

2098
01:30:53,359 --> 01:30:59,799
people with experience over credentials

2099
01:30:56,800 --> 01:31:02,440
in those cases it's a lot easier for me

2100
01:30:59,800 --> 01:31:05,760
you know the places where I'm forced by

2101
01:31:02,439 --> 01:31:08,879
regulations to hire for credentials over

2102
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:10,679
experience then I've got a little more

2103
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:12,520
effort involved in making sure they're

2104
01:31:10,679 --> 01:31:15,520
not killing the plants like I've seen

2105
01:31:12,520 --> 01:31:19,119
some a lot of really basic mistakes

2106
01:31:15,520 --> 01:31:23,239
you'd think you know certain you know

2107
01:31:19,118 --> 01:31:25,479
Growers shouldn't make one example was

2108
01:31:23,238 --> 01:31:28,000
you know ordering some cocoa choir you

2109
01:31:25,479 --> 01:31:29,399
can get domestic cocoa Choir in Colombia

2110
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:33,000
it's not like you're importing it from

2111
01:31:29,399 --> 01:31:35,238
Sri Lanka it's Colombian Coco but

2112
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:37,319
they're pretty damn slack about

2113
01:31:35,238 --> 01:31:40,198
consistency and they might say on it

2114
01:31:37,319 --> 01:31:44,000
that it's 0.1 EC and you get it and it's

2115
01:31:40,198 --> 01:31:46,599
1.6 or 1.2 and the plants have toxic

2116
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:50,639
shock because it the Coco hasn't been

2117
01:31:46,600 --> 01:31:53,360
washed or buffered so it's all salty and

2118
01:31:50,639 --> 01:31:55,800
you're screwed you know so I've seen

2119
01:31:53,359 --> 01:31:58,359
that happen as a mistake in a learning

2120
01:31:55,800 --> 01:32:01,400
curve for them and I made it very clear

2121
01:31:58,359 --> 01:32:03,439
you don't unload Coco from a truck until

2122
01:32:01,399 --> 01:32:07,000
you've done this test where you run

2123
01:32:03,439 --> 01:32:08,839
water through it and test the EC period

2124
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:11,359
that's all you got to do it's not a big

2125
01:32:08,840 --> 01:32:14,159
test it's a handful of cocoa some water

2126
01:32:11,359 --> 01:32:16,639
and does it change the AC okay don't

2127
01:32:14,158 --> 01:32:18,879
take it off the truck send it back and

2128
01:32:16,639 --> 01:32:21,880
then I was back like four months later

2129
01:32:18,880 --> 01:32:25,079
and they did it again that they bottled

2130
01:32:21,880 --> 01:32:27,960
the cocoa without wash is not washed or

2131
01:32:25,079 --> 01:32:30,479
buffered and the plants get toxic shock

2132
01:32:27,960 --> 01:32:34,719
within 48 Hours of being transplanted

2133
01:32:30,479 --> 01:32:37,919
you know I show up going what

2134
01:32:34,719 --> 01:32:40,359
up so and then I just said you know what

2135
01:32:37,920 --> 01:32:42,760
no more cocoa I just ruled it out I said

2136
01:32:40,359 --> 01:32:45,519
you can't get any more cocoa so that's

2137
01:32:42,760 --> 01:32:47,400
it the uh and now I make them just chop

2138
01:32:45,520 --> 01:32:51,040
off hemp stocks I said we just fill the

2139
01:32:47,399 --> 01:32:55,039
fields with hemp and other we use croia

2140
01:32:51,039 --> 01:32:58,000
as a cover crop as well so I say just

2141
01:32:55,039 --> 01:33:02,039
chop up the cotal area chop up the H

2142
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:04,198
that's the medium no more no more cocoa

2143
01:33:02,039 --> 01:33:07,519
and since since we stopped buying cocoa

2144
01:33:04,198 --> 01:33:09,479
and just used medium we grow you know

2145
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:13,679
it's easy to grow fiber at the equator

2146
01:33:09,479 --> 01:33:15,919
there's lots of fiber plants but the um

2147
01:33:13,679 --> 01:33:18,560
I've been growing even on my backyard

2148
01:33:15,920 --> 01:33:21,000
stuff the last few years probably three

2149
01:33:18,560 --> 01:33:24,480
years now I've been growing with all the

2150
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:26,359
chopped up stocks of years before so it

2151
01:33:24,479 --> 01:33:28,359
only works if you had bigger stocks when

2152
01:33:26,359 --> 01:33:30,920
I had some really huge ones when I

2153
01:33:28,359 --> 01:33:32,799
started but I've been able to recycle

2154
01:33:30,920 --> 01:33:36,158
these soil and I just chop up all the

2155
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:38,840
stocks and put it into it it's it's been

2156
01:33:36,158 --> 01:33:40,920
lazy medium but if you have plants that

2157
01:33:38,840 --> 01:33:42,960
are really Milo susceptible you might

2158
01:33:40,920 --> 01:33:44,960
get some in them so I've seen it affect

2159
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:48,439
some that way cuz that's totally

2160
01:33:44,960 --> 01:33:52,359
uncomposted like just green stocks right

2161
01:33:48,439 --> 01:33:55,319
but uh overall it works Dy

2162
01:33:52,359 --> 01:33:57,759
I I'd rather just keep using it and not

2163
01:33:55,319 --> 01:33:59,198
use the plants that don't like it so

2164
01:33:57,760 --> 01:34:00,480
what kind of nutrients are you feeding

2165
01:33:59,198 --> 01:34:03,879
in that sort of

2166
01:34:00,479 --> 01:34:06,599
medium I mix up like I used to make

2167
01:34:03,880 --> 01:34:08,480
Steve's Special Blend as a dry mix or as

2168
01:34:06,600 --> 01:34:10,679
a wet mix and that's actually going to

2169
01:34:08,479 --> 01:34:14,000
be released again this spring under

2170
01:34:10,679 --> 01:34:16,920
licens by a company in BC here but that

2171
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:19,198
was I had about 17 things in the dry mix

2172
01:34:16,920 --> 01:34:23,600
so all different meals like alala meal

2173
01:34:19,198 --> 01:34:28,559
corn meal kelp meal corn gluten you know

2174
01:34:23,600 --> 01:34:30,159
was the cornmeal the uh green sand rock

2175
01:34:28,560 --> 01:34:33,840
what is it Rock

2176
01:34:30,158 --> 01:34:36,479
fos yeah all kinds of you know back then

2177
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:38,119
you had more of a range of guos and

2178
01:34:36,479 --> 01:34:41,158
another they not really allowed to sell

2179
01:34:38,118 --> 01:34:44,198
guos so it's we used to have Chilean

2180
01:34:41,158 --> 01:34:47,519
seabird guano fruit bat guano and then

2181
01:34:44,198 --> 01:34:49,399
regular bat guano and uh I do the bone

2182
01:34:47,520 --> 01:34:51,880
meal at like three different grinds so

2183
01:34:49,399 --> 01:34:55,238
you get have extra fine fine medium for

2184
01:34:51,880 --> 01:34:58,159
slower release I'm also starting to

2185
01:34:55,238 --> 01:35:00,399
pelletize that dry mix so you can use it

2186
01:34:58,158 --> 01:35:03,359
as more slow releas as well or just take

2187
01:35:00,399 --> 01:35:05,039
it out if you're doing a plant somewhere

2188
01:35:03,359 --> 01:35:06,759
you want to just take some pellets out

2189
01:35:05,039 --> 01:35:10,519
to throw in the hole for kind of slow

2190
01:35:06,760 --> 01:35:14,239
release so the U what else was in that

2191
01:35:10,520 --> 01:35:16,440
mix feather meal I made a vegan mix with

2192
01:35:14,238 --> 01:35:19,198
no animal products of course and then I

2193
01:35:16,439 --> 01:35:21,960
had the regular one had feather me meal

2194
01:35:19,198 --> 01:35:25,439
and bone meal and blood meal and it

2195
01:35:21,960 --> 01:35:29,319
um sunflower seed Hull as

2196
01:35:25,439 --> 01:35:32,158
0040 that's a good one um I would still

2197
01:35:29,319 --> 01:35:35,920
use some Epsom salts because you know

2198
01:35:32,158 --> 01:35:37,920
they're you need the magnesium and epsom

2199
01:35:35,920 --> 01:35:41,000
salts are naturally occurring salts

2200
01:35:37,920 --> 01:35:45,158
they're not like a strip super phosphate

2201
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:50,039
or something I feel the like making that

2202
01:35:45,158 --> 01:35:54,118
good dry mix and then I add my homemade

2203
01:35:50,039 --> 01:35:57,158
kitchen compost so from all my eggs all

2204
01:35:54,118 --> 01:35:59,719
my banana peels and avocados and all all

2205
01:35:57,158 --> 01:36:02,599
the kitchen compost I put in the

2206
01:35:59,719 --> 01:36:04,760
backyard which I also use uh I have a

2207
01:36:02,600 --> 01:36:07,360
very tiny lawn on the one side of the

2208
01:36:04,760 --> 01:36:09,960
pool so I cut that and dump the grass in

2209
01:36:07,359 --> 01:36:13,719
there to layer it up so it's totally

2210
01:36:09,960 --> 01:36:15,800
just home homemade backyard compost but

2211
01:36:13,719 --> 01:36:19,079
if I wasn't using that I would be buying

2212
01:36:15,800 --> 01:36:21,119
worm castings and uh even that they're

2213
01:36:19,079 --> 01:36:23,600
not all created equal but if you find a

2214
01:36:21,118 --> 01:36:26,039
nice silky black R castings there's some

2215
01:36:23,600 --> 01:36:27,480
good brands out there all right Steve I

2216
