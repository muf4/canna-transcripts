i

43
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,478
figured it would be a good like dig my

44
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,600
toes in before i hit the actual inbred

45
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:41,759
line you know

46
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:43,759
it's pretty good you know the inbred

47
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,759
line is is the uh

48
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:46,560
throttle line you know

49
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,359
yeah

50
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:52,560
it's just two two lines from you know

51
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:54,399
from like snow higher and like whoever

52
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,079
else had it that gave me it way back

53
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:59,118
when i just finally got a hold of them

54
00:01:56,078 --> 00:02:00,000
and opened them up combined them again

55
00:01:59,118 --> 00:02:02,640
you know

56
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,920
but that that wasn't the darwo line

57
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,478
yeah yeah

58
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:09,360

59
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:10,239
oh no that chocolate tie is different oh

60
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,280
okay

61
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:16,080

62
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:19,199
his buddies in canada or something oh

63
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,440

00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:25,840
introduced themselves to swami why don't

66
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,160

67
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,400
are and like what you do

68
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:34,000
well i've been doing this forever you

69
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:37,120
know but i i started out oh probably in

70
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,159
my mid-20s you know as as far as

71
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,640
breeding

72
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:42,159
plants goes or crossing types together

73
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:44,878
you know back then we didn't really have

74
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:46,719
a lot to work with if you wanted seed

75
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:50,159
you had to drive hundreds of freaking

76
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:52,318
miles or go to amsterdam or take your

77
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:54,479
chances with whatever mail order service

78
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:56,479
you could get right you know

79
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:57,359
in 96 i drove

80
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:59,039
[ __ ]

81
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,920
200 miles to

82
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:03,919
vancouver and bought seeds direct from

83
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:07,119
mark emery you know for two hundred

84
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:09,518
dollars a pack for for uh you know a

85
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,680
pack of blueberry and uh what was it

86
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:14,719
bubble berry and uh

87
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,000
oh you know all that stuff back then and

88
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:18,318
it was good

89
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,959
you know we we liked it we worked with

90
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:21,359
it

91
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,439
everybody bought it everybody loved it

92
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,879
yeah it's amazing how times change now

93
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:27,919
you can just get on the internet and

94
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:31,039
order some seeds with your credit card

95
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:33,679
the trading scene alone is incredible

96
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:36,400
you know when you get into the trading

97
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,080
aspect of it it's the greed aspect of it

98
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,519
just kind of falls away and now we don't

99
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,599
even count seed anymore we're just like

100
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:43,120
oh here have some of these right you can

101
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:45,280
have some of those have some of these i

102
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,200
noticed that when i planted all those uh

103
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,360
back crosses i

104
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:51,119
just automatically figure like 10 to 12

105
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,560
seeds a pack and i don't even know what

106
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,878
you threw in there i think there was

107
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,120
like 18 all together

108
00:03:54,878 --> 00:04:00,479
well there's a method to my madness man

109
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,158
and that's my success is your success

110
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:05,518
right and that's that's that's what it's

111
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:07,598
all about you know it's best that i

112
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,319
give people a lot of seed so they

113
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:11,919
actually grow them and get the phenotype

114
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:13,438
that they're after you know when they

115
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:15,438
order the seed

116
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:18,560
right but then you're giving more people

117
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:21,599
more seeds for the same amount of money

118
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,560
well yeah you can't have that

119
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,879
well

120
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,800
it doesn't bother me right you know

121
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:29,759
you're doing it the right way

122
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,120
it's it's it's about getting people

123
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,639
what they need

124
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:36,319
absolutely you know they want specific

125
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,639
things so they

126
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:42,399
select these types for the specific

127
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:44,639
trait or these combination of traits and

128
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:45,599
they want those they want those results

129
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,519
you know or they want that

130
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,600
experimentation they want to they want

131
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:52,399
something different right you know we're

132
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,280
supposed to be different yeah absolutely

133
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:55,599
um

134
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:57,359
so we're talking about late 80s when you

135
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,439
started breeding

136
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,479
oh yeah when i first started throwing

137
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:03,360
pollen around it was probably 88 or 89

138
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:05,439
you know

139
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,520
just whatever we had with you know

140
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:10,399
california indicas and mexicans and

141
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:12,959
stuff like that and we were so young you

142
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:15,599
know yeah you never really see anything

143
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:18,638
through to fruition when you're 18 19

144
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,560
years old you know yeah well that comes

145
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,360
with learning patience with the plan as

146
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,759
well

147
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,240
right and i you know i grew up reading

148
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:28,160
high times for my parents and everything

149
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,319

156
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:44,719
it was it was all we had you know if you

product that they don't even need

169
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:11,919
well it's that it's the gray area in

170
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:14,639
cannabis that's always been you know the

171
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:17,519
the legality aspect of it so created

172
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,960
this subculture of word of mouth

173
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:21,639
right you know

174
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:24,399
so you know just the craziest

175
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:26,160
non-biological stuff that ever happened

176
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:28,799
you know was was

177
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,840
somehow accepted as common practice

178
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,680
right

179
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:33,198
like everybody threw their soil away at

180
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,120
one point in the game i remember

181
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,400
throwing my soil away because it's no

182
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,319
good anymore

183
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:39,758
yeah and i can't tell you how much i

184
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:42,160
appreciate some of the knowledge that

185
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:44,720
you've instilled on me as far as reusing

186
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,080
that soil and the the results that you

187
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,080
can get from it

188
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:49,519
well yeah you know back in the 90s when

189
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:50,800
we were doing this and throwing the

190
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:52,399
stuff away

191
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:56,160
we got tired of trying to hide it in

192
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:58,159
dumpsters and weird places you know yeah

193
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,160
we started putting it in our gardens

194
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,919
mm-hmm you know you know all the growers

195
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,520
i knew that's what we were doing oh yeah

196
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:06,560
i was the same way so we started

197
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:09,439
noticing that our gardens were like hey

198
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,439
we're doing good

199
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,519
so yeah and then and then people started

200
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:17,038
picking up the recycled soil thing you

201
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:19,198
know and

202
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:21,360
and figuring out that it was it's really

203
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,439
just based in mythology

204
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,879
the whole cannabis grill culture you

205
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:25,680
know right

206
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:28,319
so

207
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:31,759
even aside from breeding you're saying

208
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:33,680
that started late 80s mid 80s

209
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,360
but you're also a lifetime cannabis

210
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,360
grower right you actually come from

211
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,280
generations of growers

212
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,240
well pretty much yeah

213
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:42,318
you know

214
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,800
let me ask you when you were getting

215
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:47,520
into this there wasn't as many people to

216
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,439
idolize as there is today but when you

217
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:51,839
were getting into it who did you look up

218
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:54,240
to who was like this is the seeds that i

219
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:57,198
want this is what i need to go after

220
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,199
well my parents you know in 82 they i

221
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:02,400
remember bundling and playing with the

222
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:04,800
real roadkill skunk you know i got crack

223
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:06,560
when i was 13 years old i did two weeks

224
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,639
in juvenile hall because i took some

225
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,000
skunk bud to school

226
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,400
you know

227
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,399
it was no joke you know one bong hit

228
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:17,679
wrapped up in a baggie stuck down in

229
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:20,478
your your pocket sitting in sixth period

230
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,519
blew up the whole freaking room man

231
00:08:20,478 --> 00:08:23,918
you know

232
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:26,959
and there was nothing like it you know

233
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:28,799
people say oh it smells like skunk well

234
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:31,359
yeah but it

235
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:34,158
it it smells like cannabis too you know

236
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:36,479
all right it smells like good cannabis

237
00:08:34,158 --> 00:08:38,240
oh it's probably the loudest thing i've

238
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,080
ever smelled you know

239
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,080
but you know i paid attention to what

240
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,080
was going on in the magazines and stuff

241
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,720
and i remember reading the old seed

242
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:49,759
catalogs that my parents had and i was

243
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,720
processing herb by 11 years old

244
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:52,480
so

245
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,920
you know we we just grew up around it

246
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,839
you know they had all that stuff they

247
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:57,759
had high times and all the little the

248
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:00,640
catalogs and everything laying around

249
00:08:57,759 --> 00:09:03,120
and as kids we read that stuff you know

250
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:04,958
like the fabulous furry freak brothers i

251
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,320
remember reading those too

252
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:08,639
nice

253
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,440
and they were associated with bikers you

254
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:12,159
know

255
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:14,399
so they got the stuff they got the cuts

256
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:16,319
they got the seeds they got you know

257
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,480
whatever that those guys are running up

258
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,519
and down the coast and what was that at

259
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,519
that time

260
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:23,839
oh just whatever they had you know i

261
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:26,560
just i couldn't tell you this was before

262
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:28,959
there was uh metal halides and

263
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:30,958
stuff like that people just grew with

264
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:32,958
fluorescent bulbs and they and they had

265
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:34,799
just all these weird designs of

266
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:36,639
fluorescent spectrums that they thought

267
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:38,639
would do good and

268
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:41,360
people go to this one growth store in

269
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:44,080
seattle and that was the main source for

270
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:47,039
all the stuff you know right but at that

271
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:49,839
time you know fluorescents were a step

272
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:52,639
ahead the old

273
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:55,200
oh yeah i mean that i still vividly

274
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:58,240
remember these fluorescent tubes growing

275
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:00,720
roads kill skunk you know

276
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,560
that was one of my first gross was uh

277
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,040
actually the very first girl that i ever

278
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:07,119
had was with a whole chicken's heat lamp

279
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:09,278
thinking that would be a good idea and

280
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:12,879
then uh after that we shortly moved to

281
00:10:09,278 --> 00:10:14,159
this uh the t5s we went to t5s when

282
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:16,240
those came out

283
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:18,480
but you know as i grew up you know

284
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,560
regionally wherever you were

285
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,240
you kind of sourced the best stuff that

286
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:24,239
was around you know

287
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,759
to grow you know whoever's growing this

288
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,759
hey i want a cut of that i want to i

289
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:29,838
want to grow this stuff and most of the

290
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:31,200
time we never knew what it was

291
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:32,880
you know and then

292
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,640
sometime around in the game people

293
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:38,000
started paying attention to what things

294
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:40,480
really were oh this is blueberry

295
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,759
that was really the biggest

296
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,920
you know

297
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:45,679
wave that started changing everything

298
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:48,479
was blueberry

299
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:51,359
i'm i'm talking like mid 90s now is is

300
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,839
when this stuff took off and and the the

301
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,600
fruity names the bubbly names started

302
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:56,959
popping up you know

303
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,639
what are you working with now that

304
00:10:56,958 --> 00:11:02,239
you're excited about

305
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:04,078
oh just everything man i have so many

306
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,079
things going on i do

307
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:08,639
everything you know i'm not really in

308
00:11:06,078 --> 00:11:11,519
one magazine culture methodology of

309
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:13,919
breeding oh we have to do f1 f2 f3 and

310
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:16,159
then select out you know i do that with

311
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:18,479
some type but

312
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:21,199
that's not my gig man you know there's

313
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:23,680
not a there's not a certain profile that

314
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,560
a type has to match to catch your

315
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:27,278
interest

316
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:29,518
well i kind of do that i kind of put

317
00:11:27,278 --> 00:11:31,200
things together based upon what their

318
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,519
similarities are

319
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,320
or what they're what their their lineage

320
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,200
is

321
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,720
you know

322
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,959
right one of the one of the things i

323
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,759
like doing is taking older afghanis and

324
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:42,958
combining them with their ancestry you

325
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:44,639
know

326
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:46,639
with newer collections with older

327
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:48,319
collections and stuff like that

328
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:50,159
okay so

329
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,440
i had a really good question from a

330
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:53,759
viewer here

331
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:56,480
how many plants of a particular strain

332
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:58,480
do you grow out um when you're choosing

333
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,959
a new breeder like say

334
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,480
you want to work with uh dj shorts for

335
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:04,319
the first time how many seeds are you

336
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,480
gonna oh god

337
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,720
as many as possible man if i have a

338
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:11,278
hundred i'll crack a hundred you know

339
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:13,120
that's a good way to be

340
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:15,439
it's a it's critical

341
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,480
it but if i only have five seeds of

342
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,360
something

343
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,519
then

344
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,759
you know that really narrows your window

345
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:23,759
so if i have five seeds or something and

346
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:24,958
i don't get any males well that's a dead

347
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:27,360
end line

348
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:29,039
unless i figure something out so what

349
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,200
i'll do is i'll i'll go through

350
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:34,399
everything i have and say okay what's

351
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:37,040
the best thing i have that's gonna made

352
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:40,159
up with this type that's gonna you know

353
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:42,480
enhance its its characteristics

354
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:44,159
i actually have a personal question for

355
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,079
you um

356
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:47,360
so you have thousands of seeds you have

357
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:49,759
all the seeds that you need at your

358
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:52,079
disposal how many

359
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:55,759
would you consider to be the minimum

360
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:57,359
amount to be a proper final hunt oh i a

361
00:12:55,759 --> 00:13:00,720
hundred is good

362
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:02,560
i know okay i i like a hundred because

363
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,120
you're not going overboard and it's a

364
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:07,838
pretty fat range of expressions in there

365
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,600
and it gives you the ability to call out

366
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:12,000
all the weaker stuff without having to

367
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,600
worry depending on what you're working

368
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,799
with you know if i

369
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,680
if i have

370
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:19,679
two parents of unrelated genetic origin

371
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:22,239
say a thai and an afghani who've never

372
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:23,439
met each other before and i combine them

373
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,799
together

374
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:29,360
and i get my f1s what my hope is there

375
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:30,319
is that they have heterosis bigger

376
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,200
right

377
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,519
that

378
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,839
they express traits and characteristics

379
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:38,000
that are better than both parents

380
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:40,800
and that's generally the case with with

381
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:44,000
working with unrelated genetic material

382
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:46,399
so why not why not do that and give

383
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,480
those to people so they can really have

384
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,639
some fun you know what i mean and that's

385
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,320
what we love about you man i've got

386
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:54,480
another really good question from a

387
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:57,440
follower here it says what three to five

388
00:13:54,480 --> 00:14:00,480
strains best represent your work and why

389
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:03,920
oh probably mazar guillero because i've

390
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:06,079
worked the lion so extensively you know

391
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:09,039
taking the two land races combined them

392
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:11,679
together and and really selected out the

393
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:12,879
parents over a long period of time

394
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:15,039
to uh

395
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:16,639
get the traits and the expressions and

396
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:18,399
everything that i wanted out of the line

397
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:20,000
without boxing it in

398
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,919
you know because you're i'll you'll

399
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,720
still get some i i

400
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:26,479
like to keep the lines open a little bit

401
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,959
so that people that

402
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:32,399
don't like a lot of indica can select a

403
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:34,000
little more sativa if they want to right

404
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:36,559
that's a good way to be

405
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,958
it's it's it's reality man

406
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:43,119
so you know i i personally like the

407
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:44,958
heavy indica as our 7 76 chiaro myself

408
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,480
but some people man just really just

409
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:48,319
throw on the couch and they're slobber

410
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,839
and they're passed out they get up and

411
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,680
they go raid the fridge and they go back

412
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:54,160
to the couch and it's it's really

413
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:56,239
non-productive for them right you know

414
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:58,319
and what what type of strains do you

415
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,720
prefer do you prefer the more productive

416
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:03,440
stuff or is it a good mix of

417
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:05,680
both throughout the day well i use it

418
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,519
you know as a human being so

419
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:10,000
i'll do the sativas in the morning and

420
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:12,320
the indicas at night right you know have

421
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,639
you ever noticed people that react to

422
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:17,120
those things differently

423
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:19,440
um generally

424
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,519
um depending on what you give them you

425
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,279
know like if i smoke a

426
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:26,159
haze dominant type with somebody who's

427
00:15:23,278 --> 00:15:27,600
not used to smoking like sativas dude

428
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:29,120
you know like eight o'clock in the

429
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,399
morning here have a cup of coffee and

430
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,078
hit a haze

431
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:33,679
they'll be luke

432
00:15:32,078 --> 00:15:37,599
missy has a couple friends that have

433
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:40,078
given some really really heavy hazes um

434
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,000
i we even smoked the moose and lobster

435
00:15:40,078 --> 00:15:44,078
professor p which has the cali mist in

436
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,278
it and we gave that to her friend she

437
00:15:44,078 --> 00:15:49,120
was down she said she was tired she i

438
00:15:47,278 --> 00:15:50,958
was like wow really

439
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:53,679
that's interesting man a lot of women

440
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:55,278
really like the cali mist right

441
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:58,078
that was really successful with the

442
00:15:55,278 --> 00:16:00,639
women i'm just wondering if it's not one

443
00:15:58,078 --> 00:16:03,039
of those things where they use um like

444
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:04,639
methylphenidate for adhd kids and it

445
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:07,919
actually has the opposite effect you

446
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:10,320
know there's so much going on here

447
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:12,240
everything is different right that's the

448
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,079
most incredible thing about it all is

449
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,440
every single one of these types

450
00:16:14,078 --> 00:16:17,439
everything that i do

451
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,560
has a different effect or a different

452
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,120
result

453
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:23,838
so you can really narrow down what

454
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:26,320
people want in their medicine you know

455
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:27,920
so a lot of my customers they're like

456
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:30,240
tell me what i want

457
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:32,399
this is what i need so do you find a lot

458
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,360
of people coming to you asking you

459
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:35,039
um

460
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,480
what do you have that's going to be good

461
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:39,519
for my ailment

462
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:42,079
yeah and that's been consistent over the

463
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:44,240
the last 10 years that's awesome and you

464
00:16:42,078 --> 00:16:47,439
actually have a

465
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:49,440
type that is good for ptsd correct

466
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,279
yeah that nigerian sunshine is another

467
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,440
one of those top three lines i don't

468
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:55,519
want to dig into that so bad

469
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:57,600
and i said i've worked extensively and

470
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:58,399
then isolated a couple phenotypes you

471
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,480
know

472
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:01,919
but i like to keep that one open too

473
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,240
because i don't really i don't want to

474
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:06,639
lose that 76 nigerian expression in

475
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:08,798
there you know right that's awesome that

476
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:11,038
you do that and especially in a day and

477
00:17:08,798 --> 00:17:13,519
age where a lot of people are cubing

478
00:17:11,038 --> 00:17:15,679
their stuff or they're bottlenecking it

479
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:18,000
in one form or another you know

480
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:20,880
and i do that too you know i have my

481
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,720
back crosses in my cubes and for the

482
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,640
people that are going after and it's

483
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:27,360
it's it's uniformity you know they want

484
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:29,600
the uniformity so

485
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:32,159
it's it's easy to do there you go

486
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:34,240
so tell us a little bit about this blue

487
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,679
orca that i see you crossing with

488
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:39,440
everything

489
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:41,759
it's the sister of the one

490
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:45,200
you know um there were there were nine

491
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:48,319
cuts in 1983 that were distributed to

492
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:50,640
nine brotherhood of eternal love members

493
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:52,960
and they all had names

494
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:55,679
right uh the one

495
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:57,519
was the one because it had

496
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:59,600
the narrowest leaf

497
00:17:57,519 --> 00:18:01,200
yeah it was the one that looked like

498
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:03,359
that yeah

499
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,200
it was tie dominant and

500
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:07,519
so they named these and they gave them

501
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,720
to those nine members blue orca was

502
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:10,960
cootes

503
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:14,319
uh there was mary poppins was another

one and nazis cut was another one uh

505
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:19,200
crystal flowers was another one i've

506
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:20,558
heard that name but most of these are

507
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,440
lost nowadays

508
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:23,839
well

509
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:26,000
there's seven lost sisters that nobody

510
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:27,759
knows where they were or what or i mean

511
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,160
what happened to them or where they are

512
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:32,879
you know yeah they're probably extinct

513
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,880
or there are there types nowadays that

514
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,559
people just don't even know

515
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,559
but for example

516
00:18:36,558 --> 00:18:41,759
you know when i grew out the i forget

517
00:18:38,558 --> 00:18:44,319
which chem it was chem d or something

518
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:45,599
some years ago the first thing i noticed

519
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:47,839
was how

520
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:49,279
much it resembled the one in blue orca

521
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:52,319
and there really wasn't anything out

522
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:54,639
there that matches those profiles like

523
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:56,879
that oh wow you know

524
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,759
if you've had the the afgui

525
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,360
yeah

526
00:18:57,759 --> 00:19:01,839
it's been a while but

527
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:03,839
some gooey breeder it's kind of like

528
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:06,159
that you know an afghan and a thai

529
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:09,359
dominant kind of thing it's just greasy

530
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:11,519
as sweet as hell you know yeah

531
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:12,879
you know yeah jinx was doing some work

532
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:15,119
with that after

533
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,400
it was good it was you know it was just

534
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:19,119
kind of loose

535
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:22,720
so tell us a little bit about the story

536
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:25,038
behind the blue orca going to mexico

537
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:27,200
oh that was that's not the blue orca

538
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:29,279
that was the roadkill skunk oh that was

539
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,919
the roadkill skunk and then that was the

540
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:33,440
one that was hit with the european

541
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:36,640
yeah this guy

542
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:39,440
he you know took a bag from humble

543
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:41,840
which was the road kill skunk and 85 to

544
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:44,000
mexico to his sister

545
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:45,599
who live there and they're heady as hell

546
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,599
you know so

547
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:50,798
she gives it to her favorite local

548
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:52,879
farmer who happens to be you know

549
00:19:50,798 --> 00:19:55,839
in the export business and grows a

550
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:58,559
european type and that was just the drug

551
00:19:55,839 --> 00:20:00,240
cultivar over in that area right yeah

552
00:19:58,558 --> 00:20:01,038
and then they're supposed to be pretty

553
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,079
good

554
00:20:01,038 --> 00:20:06,480
from what i hear i i've never smoked a

555
00:20:03,079 --> 00:20:08,798
period pan so i wouldn't know the

556
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:11,038
the mexican farmer hybridized it into

557
00:20:08,798 --> 00:20:11,918
that type for 30 years

558
00:20:11,038 --> 00:20:15,279
wow

559
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:17,679
it's a 30 year roadkill skunk mexican

560
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:18,720
nice and you have that

561
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:20,080
no

562
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:23,279
no you done

563
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:25,439
well she we only got a few seeds in and

564
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:27,918
we split them between two guys and he

565
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,200
got the females and i got the mail oh

566
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:31,038
man

567
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,840
and

568
00:20:31,038 --> 00:20:37,759
i sent the pollen and it didn't hook up

569
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:40,319
so was it a sterile male or was it no

570
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:42,000
you know just how however the pollen got

571
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:44,079
there maybe it got too hot during

572
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,359
transit or something like that

573
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:51,038
it just didn't work out that's too bad

574
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:52,798
but you do offer other rks crosses

575
00:20:51,038 --> 00:20:55,038
well i took the males and the first

576
00:20:52,798 --> 00:20:55,918
thing i thought was oh i gotta save this

577
00:20:55,038 --> 00:20:58,960
stuff

578
00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:00,880
you know what am i gonna do so

579
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:03,200
naturally it was the one blue orca and

580
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:05,679
cherry bomb since they were the oldest

581
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,759
and out of those three crosses which one

582
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:09,919
became your favorite

583
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:13,038
oh i like the blue orca

584
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:15,600
by the 85 mexican what is it about that

585
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:18,319
blue orca that just does it for you

586
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:20,158
it's uniform you know like when all the

587
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:23,038
offspring are uniform

588
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:25,440
okay so it's just a very true breeding

589
00:21:23,038 --> 00:21:27,119
right and it breeds truer than the one

590
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,880
the the one

591
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:31,839
it's it's f1's are always they're kind

592
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:34,320
of all over the place well you said it

593
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:36,399
was more thai influence yeah unless you

594
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:38,879
made it with something that it likes and

595
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:41,200
it'll go down that line you know but

596
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:43,520
mostly it's a blue orca has has the

597
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:46,159
stability and the uniformity that that

598
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:49,200
you need as a grower you know and the

599
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:50,799
early finish time and for a finish time

600
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:54,558
what is that looking like

601
00:21:50,798 --> 00:21:57,918
uh blue orca itself is uh 56 days

602
00:21:54,558 --> 00:21:59,440
56 wow that's that's always a fun

603
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:01,919
harvest when they come off fast like

604
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:03,440
that why i work with it so much and you

605
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,720
know and a lot of these landry's

606
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:09,200
afghanis

607
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:11,360
they go 75 80 85 90 days man

608
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,960
yeah that's no joke so that's something

609
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:15,038
that you're typically breeding the blue

610
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:17,600
orca with is the longer flowering

611
00:22:15,038 --> 00:22:20,319
cultivars and trying to knock them down

612
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:22,399
and and keep that heterosis bigger and

613
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:24,480
early flowering times and high resin you

614
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,480
know nice very nice all right we're

615

00:24:26,558 --> 00:24:32,240
can you give us some insight about what

667
00:24:29,278 --> 00:24:34,400
it was over in that area that just made

668
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:37,120
some of those different types so

669
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:39,200
desirable at that time

670
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:41,359
all unique and that's what's really

671
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,679
special about them you know because

672
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:46,558
well i guess before you know the soviet

673
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:49,038
invasion all that each family had or

674
00:24:46,558 --> 00:24:50,000
tribe had their only their own type of

675
00:24:49,038 --> 00:24:52,158
hatch

676
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,519
so they cultivated their own type of

677
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:55,278
herb you know

678
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:58,480
so like

679
00:24:55,278 --> 00:25:00,798
a bulk afghanistan is some people might

680
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:03,120
consider it a mazar afghanistan because

681
00:25:00,798 --> 00:25:05,679
it's in the same little area as mazar

682
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:07,918
but it's really quite different than the

683
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:09,919
mazar afghanistan

684
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:12,159
you know even though you could it's like

685
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:13,520
just a click down the road

686
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:16,640
right

687
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:19,679
it's it's it's quality is far superior

688
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:23,278
the hash is like food grade it's so like

689
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:26,320
just creamy and nice and

690
00:25:23,278 --> 00:25:28,319
just every afghan has its own character

691
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:30,720
yeah isn't that amazing these little

692
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:32,158
micro climates can influence the plan so

693
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,519
many different ways

694
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:35,360
and it just depends on what those

695
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:37,519
farmers were doing too

696
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:39,278
you know what were they doing with their

697
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:41,599
with their herb were they taking it to

698
00:25:39,278 --> 00:25:44,159
market were they exporting it what were

699
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:46,719
they doing what was their objective how

700
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:48,960
educated were they in in farming and and

701
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,079
everything you know

702
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,759
right

703
00:25:50,079 --> 00:25:53,918
because if you if you're a shitty ass

704
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:56,319
farmer you're here you know you're

705
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:58,000
probably not going to be a very

706
00:25:56,319 --> 00:25:59,200
successful in market

707
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,400
right

708
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:04,558
that's where the herb speaks for itself

709
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:06,400
right so like when i went through these

710
00:26:04,558 --> 00:26:08,879
uh jahalabad

711
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:11,440
you know i went through like 200 at once

712
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:13,440
and i saw so many different things and

713
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:15,679
these were fresh out of the field

714
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,798
you know the next pass over from kyber

715
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:18,400
pass

716
00:26:16,798 --> 00:26:19,599
oh is that where it is

717
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,880
yeah

718
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:23,038
and uh

719
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,640
some really cool stuff man i think that

720
00:26:23,038 --> 00:26:27,038
was one of the coolest things i've ever

721
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:30,559
done and ever seen was opening up those

722
00:26:27,038 --> 00:26:32,400
200 um jihad you know out of all the

723
00:26:30,558 --> 00:26:34,158
land races and everything that was just

724
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:37,278
so cool to see

725
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:39,679
yeah i'm growing a jalalabad cross by

726
00:26:37,278 --> 00:26:41,119
farmer fly right now and

727
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:44,000
one of the things that i've seen from

728
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:46,959
that is a lot of vigor and i see these

729
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,880
gigantic fat fingers leaves

730
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,798
oh man there were so many expressions

731
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:52,720
there were index indica expressions

732
00:26:50,798 --> 00:26:55,278
there were sativa expressions there were

733
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:57,440
both there were ones that were just tall

734
00:26:55,278 --> 00:26:59,919
there were ones that were super short

735
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:02,480
wow ones that were loaded with resins or

736
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:04,000
ones that smelled like skunk body odor

737
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:06,880
gas fuel

738
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,919
um ones that just smelled like [ __ ] you

739
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,600
know

740
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:13,759
and you know

741
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:16,079
such a range such a plethora of uh

742
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:17,759
untouched stuff you know yeah that

743
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:20,558
that's one thing that i've noticed with

744
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:22,319
these is they are very very stinky and

745
00:27:20,558 --> 00:27:24,480
they have a lot of vigor i can't really

746
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:26,960
put my nose on it yet because it's our

747
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:29,278
first time going through veg but uh

748
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:31,919
definitely very very smelly fat fingered

749
00:27:29,278 --> 00:27:33,679
plants on the end that i got they're

750
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:36,000
definitely um

751
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:38,960
hindu related there's some definite

752
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,798
hindu uh hindu-esque features in there

753
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,399
right right

754
00:27:40,798 --> 00:27:44,720
so what what else are you working with

755
00:27:42,398 --> 00:27:46,479
that just really gets you go

756
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:49,038
oh man you know i love this uh you know

757
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:51,200
five haze stuff who doesn't you know

758
00:27:49,038 --> 00:27:53,599
it's it's you know it's one of the best

759
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:55,120
hybrids of all time and everything

760
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:56,319
everything you do with it is just

761
00:27:55,119 --> 00:27:57,678
incredible

762
00:27:56,319 --> 00:27:59,839
so

763
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:02,640
that work is really interesting to me is

764
00:27:59,839 --> 00:28:04,639
just to go through these nl1s and l2 and

765
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:07,919
l5 and hazes and stuff

766
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:09,520
and experiment kind of continue on like

767
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:12,240
with what neville was doing and those

768
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:13,200
guys were doing with those combinations

769
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,839
you know

770
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:18,720
like like you know one by a chocolate

771
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:20,879
tie kind of thing you know what i mean

772
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:23,440
yeah have you done that one

773
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,440
probably

774
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:27,278
probably i like that that's your answer

775
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:29,918
probably

776
00:28:27,278 --> 00:28:32,480
but you know everything is put together

777
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:35,200
for a specific reason this is this isn't

778
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:37,919
just random throwing pollen around right

779
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:39,840
right but you've been doing it so long

780
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:42,159
you've been at it so long and you're

781
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:44,240
working a lot of the same type

782
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:47,120
well i can identify treats and plants

783
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:48,640
really easy you know and identify origin

784
00:28:47,119 --> 00:28:49,439
pretty easy too

785
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,799
so

786
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,278
after you've worked with everything for

787
00:28:50,798 --> 00:28:55,359
so freaking long man you just you know

788
00:28:53,278 --> 00:28:57,839
what you're looking at you know we've

789
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:59,839
talked about that before too as far as

790
00:28:57,839 --> 00:29:01,839
like neville having the eye for thing

791
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:03,439
and you kind of have that eye as well

792
00:29:01,839 --> 00:29:05,839
yeah if you don't have the eye man

793
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:07,440
you're not gonna make it right no if you

794
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:09,599
can't select you know

795
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:11,519
easter eggs correctly it's i don't know

796
00:29:09,599 --> 00:29:13,759
you know

797
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:15,599
i'm with you

798
00:29:13,759 --> 00:29:17,519
but you know a lot of the things i do

799
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:20,158
and everything has intention

800
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:22,558
so like the oaxacan ibl by the chocolate

801
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:25,278
thai for example i want to combine that

802
00:29:22,558 --> 00:29:28,000
with the velvet rush i want to i want to

803
00:29:25,278 --> 00:29:30,398
make a mock blueberries just because

804
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,480
because i freaking can't

805
00:29:30,398 --> 00:29:34,639
yeah absolutely let's talk about that

806
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:37,278
for a second that a velvet rush that you

807
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:39,278
have that's basically like

808
00:29:37,278 --> 00:29:42,640
your version of the old juicy fruit

809
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:46,798
right well it's the first dj cross you

810
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:50,480
know the the 79 kabul afghani number one

811
00:29:46,798 --> 00:29:52,398
and the 76 77 highland blue tie from the

812
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:55,200
brotherhood of eternal love

813
00:29:52,398 --> 00:29:56,879
right and this was long this was uh how

814
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,919
many years before blueberry became a

815
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,399
thing

816
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:02,000
well i think he did the cross in 79 but

817
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:03,278
tj has always been

818
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,798
you know

819
00:30:03,278 --> 00:30:06,960
not really forthcoming with his

820
00:30:04,798 --> 00:30:08,960
information so we don't really know or

821
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,000
if you said it i never [ __ ] heard it

822
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,000
but

823
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,079
it's the highland blue tie was only

824
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,200
imported for 15 months

825
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:17,119
oh wow

826
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:20,960
that's what makes this particular one

827
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:22,959
unique and by 1976 77 the scouts that

828
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:24,240
had went and got it they knew what they

829
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,480
were looking for

830
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,599
you know they're heady as [ __ ]

831
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:30,640
so

832
00:30:27,599 --> 00:30:32,959
i have some bluetooth why the blue line

833
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,960
from the highland that the that's the

834
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,880
blue line and everything

835
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:39,679
you know right

836
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:41,520
so that's why any any blue cross that

837
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:43,519
has that highland blue tie in it is

838
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:46,158
always dominant

839
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:47,440
that is that's ex wow

840
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:49,760
that's intriguing

841
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:51,440
so you're telling me that the blue tie

842
00:30:49,759 --> 00:30:53,759
was what expressed a lot of those

843
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:55,278
blueberry flavors that that's why where

844
00:30:53,759 --> 00:30:57,038
it got its name from

845
00:30:55,278 --> 00:30:59,679
that's why man that's the basis of

846
00:30:57,038 --> 00:31:00,879
everything blue wow i thought between

847
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:02,640
the red

848
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:04,960
tie the blue tie

849
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:07,278
green tie was just associated with the

850
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,480
the bud color on it and maybe where it

851
00:31:07,278 --> 00:31:10,398
came from

852
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,679
well yeah they were different regions

853
00:31:10,398 --> 00:31:12,719
too

854
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:14,480
okay

855
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:16,720
different tribes people

856
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:18,880
did different thing so but it wasn't

857
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,640
just the blue coloration it was actually

858
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:22,320
the flavor as well

859
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:24,320
yeah that's amazing

860
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:26,558
yeah it was the characteristics of it

861
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:27,678
everything you know yeah it just all

862
00:31:26,558 --> 00:31:30,558
made sense

863
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:32,240
it's basically just those two

864
00:31:30,558 --> 00:31:33,599
you know i think the first line was

865
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:37,120
juicy fruit

866
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:39,359
so what was that uh i don't know 81 82.

867
00:31:37,119 --> 00:31:41,359
i was going to say early 80s yeah

868
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:42,719
and then in 86

869
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:44,319
at a brotherhood of eternal love

870
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:47,360
barbecue

871
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:49,439
uh mel frank gave this the velvet rush

872
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:51,199
back to coop and you know the other half

873
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,880
of it anyway

874
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,080
and told him and said hey these are

875
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,519
velvet rut

876
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:58,398
so he took him

877
00:31:55,519 --> 00:32:00,960
and he gave them to his associates

878
00:31:58,398 --> 00:32:03,759
who took them to san cle in the hills of

879
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:06,558
san clemente and did open pollinations

880
00:32:03,759 --> 00:32:07,679
with big crops for like five or six

881
00:32:06,558 --> 00:32:09,359
years

882
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:10,798
and the plants were you know they were

883
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:13,199
like 20 feet tall they said they

884
00:32:10,798 --> 00:32:14,879
exhibited every color in the rainbow

885
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,880
they had flower from the top to the

886
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:19,200
bottom when they took it to market which

887
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,919
was you know la and orange county

888
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,840
they

889
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:23,440
you know it's always the same that's you

890
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:24,639
always hear the same thing it was the

891
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,480
best around

892
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,200
you know

893
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:29,519
so

894
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:32,798
that's the story behind that

895
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:34,880
and that's where when back in 1990 or

896
00:32:32,798 --> 00:32:37,918
yeah when two got the seeds

897
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:39,120
back from them in 1990 he did a breeding

898
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:40,640
you know

899
00:32:39,119 --> 00:32:44,398
okay

900
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:46,640
he um crossed him to his 88 nl5 hey

901
00:32:44,398 --> 00:32:47,599
which is you know the one i have

902
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:50,080
right

903
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:52,240
and he had all those packs man somehow

904
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:53,839
that guy was hooked up and

905
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,839
he had everything

906
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:57,278
you know

907
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:59,678

908
00:32:57,278 --> 00:33:03,038
i i can't even remember but i i saw you

909
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:04,798

910
00:33:03,038 --> 00:33:07,200
i gave it to somebody you know because i

911
00:33:04,798 --> 00:33:09,038
had so much stuff that i was just all of

912
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:11,120
a sudden had this responsibility for him

913
00:33:09,038 --> 00:33:13,599
like oh my god you know

914
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:15,199

00:33:13,599 --> 00:33:17,519
know your wife showed me some pictures

916
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:20,640
of the early grows in i want to say the

917
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:24,798
early 2000s that was barney and or

918
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:26,240
reaverman's airborne g13 by original hey

919
00:33:24,798 --> 00:33:28,720
all right on

920
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:31,440
and it was good man everybody liked it

921
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:33,440
but as soon as i did blue orca hey

922
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:34,399
that's that [ __ ] was out the window man

923
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,399
you know

924
00:33:34,398 --> 00:33:39,518
yeah everybody that i've seen grown that

00:33:36,398 --> 00:33:42,239
yeah is really really appreciated

926
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:44,079
well it's it's it's for real

927
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:47,359
you know

928
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:49,359
it reminds me of uh cali mist is tame

929
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:51,839
compared to blue orca haze but they have

930
00:33:49,359 --> 00:33:53,519
that that uplifting kind of everything's

931
00:33:51,839 --> 00:33:56,240
cool feeling you know

932
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:57,839
right so similar effects but

933
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:01,200
much more potent

934
00:33:57,839 --> 00:34:03,119
oh god yeah oh god yeah

935
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,558

is uh

937
00:34:04,558 --> 00:34:09,599

right right now now this year i need to

1000
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:20,800
repopulate some things like you know the

1001
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,920
panama the guillermo and some stuff like

1002
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,599
that

1003
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:25,440
you know just to freshen up those seed

1004
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:28,079
you know once they get past four years

1005
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:29,280
old they start i start getting nervous

1006
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:31,200
why is that

1007
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:33,440
because their viability goes down you

1008
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:35,039
know right around five years

1009
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:37,679
you know

1010
00:36:35,039 --> 00:36:40,000
i didn't realize that was the start of

1011
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:42,319
degradation if you're if you're well i

1012
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,639
have them in storage too you know so

1013
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:47,440
they're protected but what i also have

1014
00:36:44,639 --> 00:36:49,920
some that i bring out and i work with so

1015
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:51,679
the jars are open they're in a space

1016
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:54,480
you know they're sitting there because

1017
00:36:51,679 --> 00:36:56,879
i'm packing seed all the time right so

1018
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:59,358
how do you feel about people that are

1019
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:00,720
refrigerating and freezing their seed

1020
00:36:59,358 --> 00:37:02,639
it's a good idea

1021
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:04,239
but you should really insulate

1022
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:08,078
insulate the containers that you put

1023
00:37:04,239 --> 00:37:09,838
your seed in or it'll damage the enzyme

1024
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:12,720
good tip right there

1025
00:37:09,838 --> 00:37:15,440
don't use rice and any of that dumb [ __ ]

1026
00:37:12,719 --> 00:37:16,959
just really just just really insulate

1027
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:19,358
the container well

1028
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:22,079
you know put some cotton in there and

1029
00:37:19,358 --> 00:37:23,838
then wrap it in a sock and or and then

1030
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:25,519
wrap it in some tape or something like

1031
00:37:23,838 --> 00:37:27,199
that if you're going to store your seeds

1032
00:37:25,519 --> 00:37:29,119
in a regular

1033
00:37:27,199 --> 00:37:31,199
right give it give it some buffer so

1034
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:32,960
it's not direct cold right because

1035
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:34,480
you're going to lose power

1036
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:36,320
and weird things like that are going to

1037
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:38,480
happen and there's big temperature

1038
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:40,400
fluctuations between

1039
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:42,400
cold and heat and things like that it

1040
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:44,000
really takes it takes a toll on the

1041
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:46,480
enzyme in there

1042
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,639
yeah just between freezing and room temp

1043
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:50,639
you're gonna have some breakdown and

1044
00:37:48,639 --> 00:37:52,960
that can only happen so many times

1045
00:37:50,639 --> 00:37:54,799
before it just it just like screw you

1046
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:56,400
buddy you know wow

1047
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,160
that's a hundred dollar attempt right

1048
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:00,880
there

1049
00:37:58,159 --> 00:38:03,039
we had a we had one smart ass follower

1050
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:05,280
ask will you be working

1051
00:38:03,039 --> 00:38:07,759
with runs

1052
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,640
no no runs man

1053
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:11,040
no

1054
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:13,039
not not doing any runs i don't even know

1055
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:16,960
what it is you know what is it oh gee

1056
00:38:13,039 --> 00:38:19,199
kush by cookies or it's it's runs man no

1057
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:21,920
i'm so out of the loop on any of that

1058
00:38:19,199 --> 00:38:22,879
[ __ ] i can't even keep up man

1059
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:26,240
you know

1060
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:27,280
it's just it's just it's absurd to me

1061
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:28,879
you know

1062
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:30,800
when did everybody start naming their

1063
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:32,720
stuff after candy

1064
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,880
well i don't know i think it's more they

1065
00:38:32,719 --> 00:38:36,639
the taste that they want to market they

1066
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:38,000
want to market it like candy because

1067
00:38:36,639 --> 00:38:40,400
that's the target group that they're

1068
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:43,760
hitting you know

1069
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:45,200
and everybody's just candy anymore

1070
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:47,200
uh i don't know

1071
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:49,519
when you know when you guys are saying

1072
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:51,679
stuff like oh this smells like

1073
00:38:49,519 --> 00:38:53,920
rotten dirty gym locker socks that's

1074
00:38:51,679 --> 00:38:54,799
what gets me off that's what i'm looking

1075
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,559
for

1076
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:59,760
well i'll give something a name if it

1077
00:38:56,559 --> 00:39:02,880
then if the if the uh genetic breeding

1078
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:05,359
is just way too long to say you know

1079
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:08,640
right like matanuska thunder [ __ ] by

1080
00:39:05,358 --> 00:39:11,119
shipburg afghani by alaskan thunder [ __ ]

1081
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:12,559
by 88 nl5 hayes

1082
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:14,720
but even at that point you're just

1083
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:16,880
abbreviating pretty much

1084
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:17,919
well so why not just go okay thunder

1085
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,599
[ __ ] ace

1086
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:21,838
right right

1087
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:22,880
you know right but you're not calling it

1088
00:39:21,838 --> 00:39:27,119
exotic

1089
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:27,119
uh cheated dumb banana cream

1090
00:39:32,559 --> 00:39:36,799
very nice um what do you have planned

1091
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:38,480
for the future is there anything that

1092
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:40,960
you've always wanted to get your hands

1093
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:44,320
on that you haven't been able to touch

1094
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:46,480
actually no man i i really have just

1095
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:49,119
everything and

1096
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:51,199
you know i have a lot of ibl's and um

1097
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:53,358
land races you know

1098
00:39:51,199 --> 00:39:55,279
so i basically have everything that i

1099
00:39:53,358 --> 00:39:56,799
ever need to work with there's like oh i

1100
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,680
wouldn't mind getting a hold of the puna

1101
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,680
bud

1102
00:39:57,679 --> 00:40:02,159
that's one i haven't had yeah we talked

1103
00:39:59,679 --> 00:40:03,838
about that one man that that one's a

1104
00:40:02,159 --> 00:40:06,239
hard one to find

1105
00:40:03,838 --> 00:40:08,239
i've seen cuts around man but they don't

1106
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:10,719
look like the cuts that i've seen that i

1107
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:12,000
want that's what i'm saying yet

1108
00:40:10,719 --> 00:40:14,159
they look kind of

1109
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,280
wispy compared to the chunky ones i've

1110
00:40:14,159 --> 00:40:17,838
seen

1111
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:20,720
the puna bud that was

1112
00:40:17,838 --> 00:40:22,318
basically just the old uh

1113
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:24,399
kona

1114
00:40:22,318 --> 00:40:28,079
um it's

1115
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:29,440
rumored to have lineage to captain cook

1116
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:31,519
okay

1117
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:36,079
that's all i know

1118
00:40:31,519 --> 00:40:38,480
i i remember my dad having a shoe box um

1119
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:40,000
or telling me the story about him having

1120
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:42,559
a friend that came over with the shoe

1121
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:45,199
box and opened it up and there was just

1122
00:40:42,559 --> 00:40:46,639
a big freaking cola the size of your arm

1123
00:40:45,199 --> 00:40:49,838
in there

1124
00:40:46,639 --> 00:40:51,838
back in the early 80s and mid 80s that

1125
00:40:49,838 --> 00:40:54,159
was that we were kids the in the pacific

1126
00:40:51,838 --> 00:40:55,199
northwest we were getting some hawaiian

1127
00:40:54,159 --> 00:40:56,879
stuff

1128
00:40:55,199 --> 00:40:58,000
it was incredible

1129
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:00,318
you know

1130
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,400
um one of them was buddha bud

1131
00:41:00,318 --> 00:41:04,719
it was just it was just incredible it

1132
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:07,039
was like wow

1133
00:41:04,719 --> 00:41:08,239
where'd this come from

1134
00:41:07,039 --> 00:41:10,480
you know

1135
00:41:08,239 --> 00:41:13,519
what was it that about the hawaiians

1136
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:15,280
that just stuck out to you right away

1137
00:41:13,519 --> 00:41:16,800
it's probably just the soil that the

1138
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:19,760
types were grown in

1139
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:22,079
okay you know rich rich nice good

1140
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:25,280
tropical kind of environment you know

1141
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:26,240
so and only the types that could make it

1142
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:28,640
made it

1143
00:41:26,239 --> 00:41:32,239
so anything that got mold or was weak it

1144
00:41:28,639 --> 00:41:33,598
just kind of faded away you know right

1145
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:35,358
and then there were different uh

1146
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:36,880
microclimates to the islands and you

1147
00:41:35,358 --> 00:41:38,480
know some heads took them to other

1148
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:40,318
islands some heads took them on the

1149
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:42,240
other side of the island where they

1150
00:41:40,318 --> 00:41:45,039
developed sativa traits where they

1151
00:41:42,239 --> 00:41:47,439
developed indica traits like the molokai

1152
00:41:45,039 --> 00:41:48,960
type um

1153
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:52,159
that was really interesting it was

1154
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:53,679
really the most indica dominant hawaiian

1155
00:41:52,159 --> 00:41:56,559
type that i've seen

1156
00:41:53,679 --> 00:41:58,960
you know and you think why why why would

1157
00:41:56,559 --> 00:42:01,358
they select this indica dominant type

1158
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:03,039
down there and uh whatever well i was

1159
00:42:01,358 --> 00:42:05,440
gonna say that was one of the few that i

1160
00:42:03,039 --> 00:42:06,880
experienced where the buds on it weren't

1161
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:08,960
as beautiful as some of the other

1162
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:10,318
hawaiian type oh they were ugly as hell

1163
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:12,559
too man

1164
00:42:10,318 --> 00:42:13,599
i thought oh it's a it was a leopard

1165
00:42:12,559 --> 00:42:15,759
colony

1166
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:18,880
you know they were probably selecting

1167
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:22,240
for high cbd if their if their relatives

1168
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:23,920
had anything to do with it oh wow

1169
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:25,439
because that's what people tend to do

1170
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:27,440
where they work with plants they'll

1171
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:28,800
select for what they need

1172
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:31,280
right you know

1173
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:33,519
for what feels good to them yeah that's

1174
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:34,960
one that still hangs around to this day

1175
00:42:33,519 --> 00:42:37,759
if you go over to the islands and you

1176
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:40,480
ask for molokai frost they'll have it

1177
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:42,800
like the mazar pck by the mazar i put

1178
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:45,119
together it's one of those two you know

1179
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:48,000
it was tested on old people and people

1180
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:50,079
with pain problems and things like that

1181
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,960
so it was just basically put together

1182
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:55,519
for them and as a solid indica base to

1183
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:56,880
do sativa outcrosses with

1184
00:42:55,519 --> 00:43:00,079
right have you

1185
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:02,000
done any work with uh very many africans

1186
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:04,560
yeah actually

1187
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:08,480
what are some of your favorite africans

1188
00:43:04,559 --> 00:43:10,880
um my favorite one is the trans game

1189
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:13,199
really i have some of the

1190
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:15,358
it's pretty neat man i like it

1191
00:43:13,199 --> 00:43:16,639
i like you what about it was different

1192
00:43:15,358 --> 00:43:19,519
just the effect

1193
00:43:16,639 --> 00:43:21,598
yeah the effects nice and um similar

1194
00:43:19,519 --> 00:43:23,838
structure to most of those well it's

1195
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:26,000
like any other kind of wild sativa you

1196
00:43:23,838 --> 00:43:27,358
know but it it uh it was loaded with

1197
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,159
frost

1198
00:43:27,358 --> 00:43:32,239
most of those african sativas actually i

1199
00:43:30,159 --> 00:43:34,799
i don't know if this just my experience

1200
00:43:32,239 --> 00:43:36,559
or this is how it is but they seem to be

1201
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:37,680
shorter sativas compared to some of the

1202
00:43:36,559 --> 00:43:39,838
others

1203
00:43:37,679 --> 00:43:42,318
it just depends on you know where they

1204
00:43:39,838 --> 00:43:43,279
were and what everything the swaziland

1205
00:43:42,318 --> 00:43:44,559
uh

1206
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:46,240
those were short

1207
00:43:44,559 --> 00:43:47,838
yeah and that's that's mostly what i've

1208
00:43:46,239 --> 00:43:49,679
worked with is more of that coastal

1209
00:43:47,838 --> 00:43:51,920
region off the cape there

1210
00:43:49,679 --> 00:43:54,719
and the the congo it's you know that was

1211
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:56,880
out of control like a like a vine long

1212
00:43:54,719 --> 00:43:58,318
super long over 100 day flowering time

1213
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,200
and all that you know

1214
00:43:58,318 --> 00:44:00,880
fun

1215
00:43:59,199 --> 00:44:03,519
but um

1216
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:04,800
the durbins are uh they're pretty nice

1217
00:44:03,519 --> 00:44:06,838
you know

1218
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:09,680
but those were also more

1219
00:44:06,838 --> 00:44:11,039
inland correct they're good they're good

1220
00:44:09,679 --> 00:44:12,879
but you know you

1221
00:44:11,039 --> 00:44:14,719
they have that thing where you just

1222
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:17,039
can't really smoke a whole bunch you

1223
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:18,959
just get wigged out you know yeah yeah

1224
00:44:17,039 --> 00:44:20,559
especially women and people that aren't

1225
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:22,880
used to smoking uh

1226
00:44:20,559 --> 00:44:25,119
sativas you know

1227
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:28,079
so what would you say would be a good

1228
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:29,358
intro sativa that you have produced for

1229
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:31,280
people like that

1230
00:44:29,358 --> 00:44:34,318
oh it's what you're working with right

1231
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:36,400
now like a pakistani in influx into a

1232
00:44:34,318 --> 00:44:39,039
chocolate tie you know something that's

1233
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:40,960
not predominantly indica but it has

1234
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:43,279
enough indica in it to keep them kind of

1235
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:45,119
grounded in case they aren't used to the

1236
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:46,240
effect or something you know

1237
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:48,480
right

1238
00:44:46,239 --> 00:44:51,919
i appreciate stuff like that

1239
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:53,920
good even all day smoke

1240
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:55,760
and then you know it just depends as you

1241
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:58,000
explore this stuff

1242
00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:00,480
and you explore region and you explore

1243
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,599
uh hybridization

1244
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:04,240
you start

1245
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:06,640
coming to note certain thing

1246
00:45:04,239 --> 00:45:09,439
about effect you know

1247
00:45:06,639 --> 00:45:12,719
right so like nigerian has a lot of cbd

1248
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:14,159
in it well so does the punto rojo

1249
00:45:12,719 --> 00:45:15,358
so it was like

1250
00:45:14,159 --> 00:45:17,679
duh

1251
00:45:15,358 --> 00:45:17,679
you know

1252
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:23,200
that's why it works you know

1253
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:25,200
do you have any types that you work with

1254
00:45:23,199 --> 00:45:27,759
where you're actually selecting towards

1255
00:45:25,199 --> 00:45:29,358
that cbd side

1256
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:30,960
yeah yeah

1257
00:45:29,358 --> 00:45:33,519
a lot actually

1258
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:36,000
you know mo i did a lot of hash plant

1259
00:45:33,519 --> 00:45:37,759
work let this last year

1260
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,719
that's basically i was basically putting

1261
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:40,640
uh

1262
00:45:38,719 --> 00:45:43,279
hash plants together

1263
00:45:40,639 --> 00:45:44,879
you know for resin production

1264
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:47,119
and what were some of your favorite hash

1265
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:49,519
plants that you found oh you know the

1266
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:52,318
blue orca by the black kandahar

1267
00:45:49,519 --> 00:45:54,800
you know and i put that to the

1268
00:45:52,318 --> 00:45:56,239
gym dog or the one by the turkish gummy

1269
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:57,839
or uh

1270
00:45:56,239 --> 00:45:59,358
i didn't know that you were working with

1271
00:45:57,838 --> 00:46:03,199
that turkish gummy

1272
00:45:59,358 --> 00:46:05,519
the one by uh the nl2 is another

1273
00:46:03,199 --> 00:46:07,279
another one you know where the resin is

1274
00:46:05,519 --> 00:46:08,400
just going to be off the hook

1275
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:11,839
you know

1276
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:14,880
did the turkish cross take away from

1277
00:46:11,838 --> 00:46:18,159
that slender conical shape

1278
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:19,599
oh i don't know these are fresh f1s man

1279
00:46:18,159 --> 00:46:20,639
you know i have a great background

1280
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:22,640
myself

1281
00:46:20,639 --> 00:46:24,799
there's the ones that i want to do

1282
00:46:22,639 --> 00:46:26,239
i want to get into the one by the nl2

1283
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:28,079
myself

1284
00:46:26,239 --> 00:46:30,719
just because of the similarities between

1285
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:34,160
the two and the potential the potential

1286
00:46:30,719 --> 00:46:35,439
for the effect and the resin

1287
00:46:34,159 --> 00:46:38,078
absolutely

1288
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:41,200
i i think i was talking to dash earlier

1289
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:43,920
about that nl2 or it might have been you

1290
00:46:41,199 --> 00:46:46,480
he was put it was put together in canada

1291
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:48,400
um over 30 years

1292
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:50,318
by some canadians

1293
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:52,480
who had the

1294
00:46:50,318 --> 00:46:54,400
advantage of a lot of space so they

1295
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:55,280
could do a lot of numbers

1296
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:57,440
and

1297
00:46:55,280 --> 00:47:00,160
they selected it out really so

1298
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:03,200
everything that i've used with that nl2

1299
00:47:00,159 --> 00:47:04,639
comes out in l2 dominant you know which

1300
00:47:03,199 --> 00:47:06,879
isn't surprising

1301
00:47:04,639 --> 00:47:09,519
but um yeah just most of the stuff i do

1302
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:10,640
is is hybridized for a certain outcome

1303
00:47:09,519 --> 00:47:13,358
so

1304
00:47:10,639 --> 00:47:14,799
you can put these planets up next to

1305
00:47:13,358 --> 00:47:18,480
whatever

1306
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:21,599
and they're gonna out-compete them

1307
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:24,079
what is your top criteria in a smoke

1308
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:26,240
like are you the smell the taste the

1309
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:27,760
high itself bag appeal what's most

1310
00:47:26,239 --> 00:47:29,919
important to you

1311
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:32,079
it sounds like you're going more for

1312
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:34,318
effect over anything

1313
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:35,119
does taste or smell have any play into

1314
00:47:34,318 --> 00:47:37,440
it

1315
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:39,039
it does a little bit you know that's one

1316
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:42,159
of the first things that you can select

1317
00:47:39,039 --> 00:47:44,079
for is scent and that gives you an idea

1318
00:47:42,159 --> 00:47:46,159
you know what what the taste is going to

1319
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:48,160
be but it doesn't work that way all the

1320
00:47:46,159 --> 00:47:51,199
time and you can't rely on that right

1321
00:47:48,159 --> 00:47:53,759
you know but i do that i'll select for a

1322
00:47:51,199 --> 00:47:55,199
certain characteristic dominant in that

1323
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:56,240
type

1324
00:47:55,199 --> 00:47:57,199
you know

1325
00:47:56,239 --> 00:47:59,279
right

1326
00:47:57,199 --> 00:48:00,239
but over everything else effect is

1327
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:02,240
number one

1328
00:48:00,239 --> 00:48:04,719
it's that's probably the most important

1329
00:48:02,239 --> 00:48:08,159
thing or preserving the genotype

1330
00:48:04,719 --> 00:48:10,799
you know how do you feel about the taste

1331
00:48:08,159 --> 00:48:13,118
and smell portion of that are you

1332
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:15,359
looking for something that correlates

1333
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:17,119
like the taste relates to the smell or

1334
00:48:15,358 --> 00:48:18,480
does it not matter that much as long as

1335
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:19,519
it's good

1336
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:22,400
oh

1337
00:48:19,519 --> 00:48:25,920
it's so it's such a plethora dude you

1338
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:28,160
know there's so many things that

1339
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:30,559
it's an endless rainbow

1340
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:32,639
right if i want to make banana i can

1341
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:34,800
make banana if i want to make orange i

1342
00:48:32,639 --> 00:48:37,440
can make orange if i want to make lemon

1343
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:39,200
and it goes on and on and on right so

1344
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:40,240
you're saying it depends on what your

1345
00:48:39,199 --> 00:48:42,399
goals are

1346
00:48:40,239 --> 00:48:43,919
and what you find within

1347
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:45,838
while you're doing that you know just

1348
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:47,039
what hits your fancy what takes all

1349
00:48:45,838 --> 00:48:48,719
those boxes

1350
00:48:47,039 --> 00:48:49,838
and the same thing with making pretty

1351
00:48:48,719 --> 00:48:50,879
pot too

1352
00:48:49,838 --> 00:48:53,920
you know

1353
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:56,160
the the nice fluorescent purple

1354
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:58,079
kind of stuff that everybody likes to

1355
00:48:56,159 --> 00:48:59,679
look at you know that takes really cool

1356
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:02,640
pictures and

1357
00:48:59,679 --> 00:49:04,078
and uh that's really easy to do too

1358
00:49:02,639 --> 00:49:06,639
you know

1359
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:10,559
i've always said that some of the best

1360
00:49:06,639 --> 00:49:10,558
stuff i've ever smoked to look like hell

1361
00:49:10,639 --> 00:49:13,279
generally uh

1362
00:49:12,318 --> 00:49:15,679
you know

1363
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:17,119
it's it's gonna be the landry sativas

1364
00:49:15,679 --> 00:49:19,199
that are going to rock your dome the

1365
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:21,920
most you know

1366
00:49:19,199 --> 00:49:24,799
it's not to say that uh

1367
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:27,119
a pure afghani hash plant isn't going to

1368
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:29,200
rock your dome just the same but in a

1369
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:30,720
different region of the brain you know

1370
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:32,159
right right

1371
00:49:30,719 --> 00:49:34,000
and we're looking for that up

1372

get [ __ ] done

1374
00:49:35,838 --> 00:49:38,960

1376

1380

knowledge that you've instilled on me

00:50:56,159 --> 00:50:59,440
brother like

1412
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:01,200
it wasn't just me you know there was

1413
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:03,200
there was code and there was tim wilson

1414
00:51:01,199 --> 00:51:04,239
and we we had quite a group for quite a

1415
00:51:03,199 --> 00:51:06,960
while

1416
00:51:04,239 --> 00:51:08,959
that explored all these avenues

1417
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:11,199
didn't really push the envelope to take

1418
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:13,280
everything into the next hemisphere you

1419
00:51:11,199 --> 00:51:15,199
know right but you were one of the few

1420
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:17,680
people that i personally got to interact

1421
00:51:15,199 --> 00:51:20,480
with you know so well i i appreciate

1422
00:51:17,679 --> 00:51:22,239
your character you know

1423
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:24,159
it's just i don't know everything just

1424
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:25,679
naturally worked out how it should i

1425
00:51:24,159 --> 00:51:28,799
guess you know

1426
00:51:25,679 --> 00:51:31,118
but you're doing the good work and

1427
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:33,359
in a day and age where there is a lot of

1428
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:35,680
filters that shouldn't be there um

1429
00:51:33,358 --> 00:51:37,920
you're putting forth information that's

1430
00:51:35,679 --> 00:51:39,919
correct true honest and

1431
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:42,159
