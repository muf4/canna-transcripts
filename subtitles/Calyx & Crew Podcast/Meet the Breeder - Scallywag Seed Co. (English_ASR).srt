21
00:01:10,478 --> 00:01:15,319
got into cannabis what was your first

22
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:18,118
experience like uh so I'm uh just turned

23
00:01:15,319 --> 00:01:19,798
44 this year so My First experience with

24
00:01:18,118 --> 00:01:24,478
cannabis was

25
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:27,240
uh I was probably uh What uh 13 uh 13 or

26
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:30,039
13 or 14 uh and uh I grew up in a small

27
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:31,919
town outside Winnipeg Manitoba Canada so

28
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:34,960
we're in the Prairies kind of central

29
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,719
Canada and uh I grew up in a small town

30
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:39,039
that was fairly religious and fairly

31
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:41,239
conservative and with every kind of

32
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,920
religious conservative Town there's

33
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:45,640
always a town Badd or a town kind of

34
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,879
punk that every parent always warns you

35
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:50,079
not to hang out with and uh somehow I

36
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:52,039
just gravitated towards this guy yeah I

37
00:01:50,078 --> 00:01:54,239
think a few of us are those guys but I

38
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,680
think I gravitated towards him uh in our

39
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:57,718
school that we were at our high school

40
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,560
we took a wood shop together and just

41
00:01:57,718 --> 00:02:02,438
your classic like guy who who who wasn't

42
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,159
really academic and uh he was making

43
00:02:02,438 --> 00:02:05,879
Bongs in wood in wood class while we

44
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:07,799
were making like key key chain holders

45
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:09,519
and stuff like that but yeah we ended up

46
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:11,080
connecting oddly uh through that class

47
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,400
and then I kind of would hang out with

48
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:14,680
him there's not a lot to do in these

49
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,640
towns so you kind of gravitate to just

50
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,760
finding things to do and uh I ended up

51
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:21,719
linking with up up with him one night

52
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:23,840
and always um I always had this in kind

53
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:26,239
of infatuation with cannabis the leaf

54
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,400
the uh like the the memorabilia from the

55
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:30,000
60s the covers of magazines with a pot

56
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,920
leaf I would just infatuate with the PO

57
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,159
Leaf I was kind of into the music that

58
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:36,000
promoted

59
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:37,560
can use and so I just naturally really

60
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,360
wanted to get into cannabis at that

61
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,120
young age and I kind of gravitated

62
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,840
towards him and uh because he was making

63
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,120
bongs and stuff in class and uh one

64
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,800
night we were all out together me and

65
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:48,439
another friend and he drove this really

66
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,959
old car like the batm the old Batmobile

67
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:51,039
and I remember he just picked me up uh

68
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:52,200
one time and we were just kind of

69
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:54,120
hanging out and he was like hey you want

70
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:55,679
to smoke a joint I was like do I ever

71
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,640
and so we end up smoking this joint

72
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,760
perfect and uh at the time it was like

73
00:02:57,639 --> 00:03:01,199
the first experience it wasn't really

74
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:02,719
amazing but I just remember going home

75
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:04,719
that night and eating like a lot of food

76
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:07,280
and uh but I knew it was something that

77
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:09,639
I wanted to to try again and then

78
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,120
eventually finally found my my high and

79
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:13,679
was like yeah this is this is pretty

80
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:16,120
cool man and what was that was the high

81
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,840
that you liked well just the you know

82
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:20,080
like the the first time the first few

83
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,598
times you actually experience like the

84
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,599
actual effect because I know like my

85
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:26,318
first time you know he always heard as

86
00:03:24,598 --> 00:03:27,598
you as you got into cannabis that a lot

87
00:03:26,318 --> 00:03:29,318
of people in their first experience

88
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:31,479
didn't really experience a high it was

89
00:03:29,318 --> 00:03:33,518
more just like uh a little bit of a

90
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:35,000
fuzziness and then I'm really hungry or

91
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,799
I'm tired let's go to bed and so I was

92
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,598
the guy that got no real effect but then

93
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,640
got really hungry after but I remember

94
00:03:38,598 --> 00:03:42,399
achieving the very first time that

95
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:44,318
really first effective cannabis with a

96
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,080
group of friends when we had gone and

97
00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:47,878
got some more and we all like we all

98
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,319
rolled up our own joint we were like oh

99
00:03:47,878 --> 00:03:50,719
man we got our own joint each I remember

100
00:03:49,318 --> 00:03:52,839
we smoked probably had enough actually

101
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:55,959
to consume on my own and I remember just

102
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:58,920
being like this is this is awesome man

103
00:03:55,959 --> 00:04:00,360
and so yeah that first experience was in

104
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:02,078
hindsight too now I know that there was

105
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:04,560
a lot of like Mexi brick that was coming

106
00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:06,680
through this like this kind of group of

107
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,400
people like just it like where we were

108
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,680
there was we were still in candas this

109
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,760
time right yeah we were still being

110
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,438
flooded with like brick weed that was

111
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:15,199
that was coming from Mexico there was a

112
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:17,120
lot of like South American Connections

113
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:19,079
that would come through through Paraguay

114
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,840
and a lot of these guys were like were

115
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:22,560
brining some of this Mexi like the South

116
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:23,758
American brick through right and a lot

117
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,959
of it also came from Mexico there was

118
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,639
some connections to that Mexico kind of

119
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:30,159
um a brick that we were getting as well

120
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:32,079
from the states or from from Mexi itself

121
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,479
and so this guy actually took these

122
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:35,038
seeds and grew them on their fluoresence

123
00:04:33,478 --> 00:04:37,000
at his mother's house and that's the

124
00:04:35,038 --> 00:04:39,199
first time I actually saw pot that night

125
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,639
too that we first experienced it and it

126
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,800
was like classic sativa to the to the to

127
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:45,400
the ceiling and you know later on found

128
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,000
out that yeah he was just breaking up

129
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:48,439
mexie brick and growing whatever you

130
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,439
could find there and it was like

131
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:51,800
obviously really sativa dominant but

132
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:54,120
yeah I just I still remember the flavors

133
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,680
like spicy I remember like it had that

134
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,478
just that look to it I remember and it

135
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,400
was just like yeah it was just

136
00:04:57,478 --> 00:05:01,079
intriguing and it just it was something

137
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:02,918
that you knew you wanted to be a part of

138
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:05,198
and that's kind of where it all started

139
00:05:02,918 --> 00:05:06,758
and I always say my dad like my dad

140
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,800
really got me started he was very

141
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:11,840
anti-cannabis but he had no idea that

142
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,800
subliminally he was uh in like probably

143
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:16,079
I was born in 79 probably in like the

144
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:18,478
earliest years of getting VCRs he got a

145
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:21,079
BCR and the first movies this guy rented

146
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:23,240
were chich and Chong like Up in Smoke

147
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:25,159
and that sort of stuff and so you know I

148
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:27,199
always say he really influenced me into

149
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,880
cannabis and so you know and he was very

150
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:31,720
anti-cannabis which was funny so but he

151
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:33,800
was a big comedian guys yeah thanks D

152
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:36,560
the show first time yeah exactly would

153
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:39,120
you say those first couple experiences

154
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,680
uh I didn't get high my first time

155
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:44,519
either it wasn't until my second time

156
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:46,879
that I really felt anything um was that

157
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:48,399
on the Mexican brick weat no this was

158
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:50,120
like I said we would always go to the

159
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:52,560
city which was Winnipeg so we were

160
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:54,639
always like we in a small town about 30

161
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,918
no 20 minutes from from Winnipeg so we

162
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,960
would often find someone who was 16 or

163
00:05:56,918 --> 00:06:00,680
have someone in our group who was

164
00:05:57,959 --> 00:06:02,879
driving and we'd all p money together

165
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:04,600
and like go there was a couple places

166
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:07,439
that were very famous in Winnipeg where

167
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:08,960
you could always always find Cannabis it

168
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:11,360
didn't matter what decade it was what

169
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:12,439
year what time of day what holiday it

170
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,759
didn't matter you could find weed there

171
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:15,639
and it was always a couple places one

172
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,800
was the merchant hotel which if anyone's

173
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:19,280
from this area they'll just know it was

174
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,960
classic we had a lot of gang activity

175
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:22,719
back in the day and this place was a

176
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:24,038
place where a lot of the guys would

177
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,319
would sell their Wares and they would

178
00:06:24,038 --> 00:06:28,079
just run up to your car throw crumpled

179
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,879
up tinfoil into your lap and you would

180
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:32,560
just give them 15 bucks and you would be

181
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:34,120
on your way but if you [ __ ] around if

182
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,680
you [ __ ] around you found out these

183
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,918
guys would carry porcelain broken up

184
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,519
porcelain in their pockets and they

185
00:06:36,918 --> 00:06:40,719
would they would shatter Windows if you

186
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:43,519
drove off without payment so it was a

187
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:45,160
pretty rough and quick exchange and then

188
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:46,639
a really classic place was the circle

189
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:48,400
and the circle was in Osborne Village

190
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,360
which is a pretty famous place and that

191
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:50,519
was another place where we would always

192
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,598
get weed but yeah we would pull our

193
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:55,359
money together go to these locations and

194
00:06:52,598 --> 00:06:57,279
buy like really good Street weed for the

195
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,520
time and I remember it would just you

196
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:02,038
know the first few times we actually got

197
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:04,399
the effect it was so awesome and intense

198
00:07:02,038 --> 00:07:06,000
that like we all knew me particularly

199
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:08,000
like this is something that I'm going to

200
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,918
have to definitely really really

201
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,879
experience for a long long time because

202
00:07:09,918 --> 00:07:13,318
I enjoyed it so much so we don't really

203
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:15,439
know what we were smoking at the time

204
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:16,960
but Winnipeg was always um a pretty

205
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:18,759
decent place to get good quality

206
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:20,120
cannabis like we had a bunch of avenues

207
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:21,598
where you could get it you could either

208
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,879
get it through a lot of the street gains

209
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:26,639
like there's a lot of uh a lot of Youth

210
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:27,919
gains in our city um you know and then

211
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,519
we also had like a lot of the biker

212
00:07:27,918 --> 00:07:32,038
connections here as well we had some

213
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:35,359
that were obviously operating here as

214
00:07:32,038 --> 00:07:38,240
well some of the selections you you gave

215
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,280
us some of the crosses in here I had to

216
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,360
ask about the Topanga and then they told

217
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:45,878
me like the US name of what we'd call it

218
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:49,000
I was like ah damn yeah like the Tanga

219
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:50,919
to me is it's like I said like Canada

259
00:09:16,078 --> 00:09:22,759
name um I mean probably I mean I was so

260
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,680
I started selling pot uh when I was in

261
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:26,958
my late teens and I had a really good

262
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:28,559
connection that worked over the west

263
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:30,679
coast and so we were able to get a lot

264
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:33,399
of like of the stuff that had names

265
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:35,799
early on uh but my first Growing

266
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:38,039
Experience like my very first cultivar

267
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:40,639
that I really like I I'm a blueberry

268
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:42,879
fanatic like a fanatic of blueberry and

269
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:46,039
have been since the day I first smoked

270
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:49,519
it heard about it saw pictures of it um

271
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:50,958
and so came with growing cannabis oh it

272
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:53,240
was and it was just just to see

273
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:55,399
something like that was just so unique

274
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:58,680
and so um and then I would get this West

275
00:09:55,399 --> 00:10:01,919
Coast blueberry from my guy and it was

276
00:09:58,679 --> 00:10:03,679
like I I said i' I'd come across like

277
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:04,838
good Street stuff before but like to

278
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:06,039
actually have something that had a

279
00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:08,440
blueberry smell that was called

280
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:10,319
blueberry it just kind of blew my mind

281
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:12,440
and so uh the first thing I grew was a

282
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,720
blueberry um uh cut and it was a

283
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:16,320
commercial cut that we grew in a like a

284
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,480
commercial setup where we were we were

285
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:21,879
running a house and uh it was it was

286
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:23,600
awesome uh and then my very first clones

287
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:25,200
though that I was able to like secure

288
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,720
from someone who did selections or was

289
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,720
able to get something from a breeder was

290
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:32,720
uh one of my favorite things was some of

291
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:35,200
the early um like the very early DNA

292
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:37,160
stuff they had a couple things like sour

293
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,160
cream and stuff like that there was a

294
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:42,319
couple clones that a guy locally had

295
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:43,919
hunted he uh had a lot of uh uh

296
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,160
Expendable cash and he was able to buy

297
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:48,240
seeds at time that were so expensive at

298
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:50,000
the time and he did a lot of hunting and

299
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,480
he had this couple cuts that were really

300
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,919
really special to us and then some

301
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:56,680
really old Canadian Cuts Like renie R is

302
00:10:54,919 --> 00:10:58,240
a really special cut up here that that a

303
00:10:56,679 --> 00:10:59,799
lot of people love and it was it was a

304
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,639
local cut here we have and then we had

305
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:03,759
some old Cuts called champagne like a

306
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:05,839

307
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:07,200
really good and stuff like that but yeah

308
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:08,279
it started as a commercial stuff so we

309
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,839
were really trying to get commercial

310
00:11:08,278 --> 00:11:13,200
flowers at the time and so it was um it

311
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:14,839
was really hunt for that sort of Avenue

312

00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,120
I think they did feminize the S1 did I

328
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:56,560
think and made S1 seeds of it I can't

329
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,240
remember what they did with the Renee

330
00:11:56,559 --> 00:12:00,319
but he made it more famous and and more

331
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,959
prominent but it's a really unique cut

332
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:05,360
it's got a it's not the most potent cut

333
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:08,919
but it's just got this um this

334
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:12,560
absolutely pungent uh nose and flavor

335
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:15,159
that's kind of like um cool water after

336
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:17,359
shave it's got a really unique nose to

337
00:12:15,159 --> 00:12:19,000
it and a skunky like it's really awesome

338
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,800
and it's it's like I said not the most

339
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,799
potent stuff but it's just a staple here

340
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:26,039
it's got such a robust nose and flavor

341
00:12:23,799 --> 00:12:27,078
that it was always really easy to move

342
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:29,078
like you could always smell it through

343
00:12:27,078 --> 00:12:31,759
the bag and it had a great look to it

344
00:12:29,078 --> 00:12:33,159
popcorn bud uh and it had a like a a

345
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:35,039
good high but nothing that would put you

346
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:37,799
in the couch and so but that was one

347
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:39,439
that a lot of people ended up passing up

348
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:41,039
as you know the new trends started

349
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,320
coming in and those are the things that

350
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:44,159
I love scooping up or hunting and

351
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,399
getting hold of after they've been kind

352
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:48,679
of forgotten about because you know I

353
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:51,159
always find there's either a Revival in

354
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:53,519
in a lot of ways either just from from

355
00:12:51,159 --> 00:12:55,519
Nostalgia or just people seeking out

356
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:58,360
tools that are a little bit less poly

357
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:59,519
hybrid hybridized and so this cut though

358
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,440
is a bit of a paint in the ass like a

359
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,919
lot of these old cuts to grow it's uh

360
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:07,320
finicky and old and takes a lot of care

361
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:09,559
but I actually just ran a a plant uh

362
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:11,160
it's SE just in the corner uh of it and

363
00:13:09,559 --> 00:13:12,958
it just finished like it likes throwing

364
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:14,958
single nanners too so it's it sometimes

365
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:16,638
can be an ugly plant but it's just the

366
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:18,319
smell and flavor it's so nostalgic for

367
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,360
us and I just love it so much and it's

368
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,480
actually it outcrosses pretty fairly

369
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,800
well too uh We've outcrossed it to a few

370
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,639
things and even though it has that

371
00:13:23,799 --> 00:13:27,439
tendency to throw single nanners it

372
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:29,240
seems to sometimes outcross really well

373
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,480
depending on who it pairs with adds

374
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:33,320
unique flavor and noses to it that you

375
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:34,800
just don't really there's nothing in it

376
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:36,120
in cannabis that smells like it in my

377
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:38,198
opinion and in a lot of other people's

378
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:40,120
opinion that that get to experience it

379
00:13:38,198 --> 00:13:42,519
but it's one of those things that not a

380
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:44,078
lot of people know of so those are the

381
00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:46,240
ones that you don't got to keep around

382
00:13:44,078 --> 00:13:48,759
they're so good they'll get shared and

383
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:51,278
it'll stay around yeah and there's a

384
00:13:48,759 --> 00:13:53,360
reason why people like want to seek it

385
00:13:51,278 --> 00:13:55,240
out again like 10 15 years after they

386
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,360
had they had smoked it or you know it's

387
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,720
the best thing when you break it out at

388
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:59,320
a party here because it is a local

389
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,639
stream that people know

390
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:02,040
and so when you sometimes break it out

391
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:04,560
at like a Christmas party or like a

392
00:14:02,039 --> 00:14:06,120
birthday or anniversary people are like

393
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:07,838
[ __ ] man like what is that and you're

394
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,959
like they're like I I've smoked that

395
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:10,600
before and you're like yeah it's renie

396
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:12,078
and they're like yeah I had a guy who

397
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,519
had a girlfriend and her guy used to

398
00:14:12,078 --> 00:14:15,758
always bring this stuff over that's it

399
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,278
man we love that we smoked it for years

400
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:19,759
that's kind of rny to us there's a lot

401
00:14:17,278 --> 00:14:22,720
of those strains but that's R to us my

402
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:24,320
favor experience yeah my favorite strain

403
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,720
going growing early on would have had to

404
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,120
been our early blueberry cut that we

405
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:29,079
were getting and we don't know where it

406
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,720
came from I know it was from the West

407
00:14:29,078 --> 00:14:33,198
Coast but it was just it was tremendous

408
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:36,040
it was a really really awesome

409
00:14:33,198 --> 00:14:37,879
cut okay that's interesting I haven't

410
00:14:36,039 --> 00:14:39,319
messed around with the blueberries too

411
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:43,759
much I have

412
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:46,320
done uh a sativa leaning blueberry and a

413
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:49,399
broadleaf blueberry the one that I got

414
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:51,800
from Canada it was definitely a thin

415
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:53,919
Leaf it had longer inner nodes and it

416
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:57,399
had very purple buds I was actually

417
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:58,879
pretty impressed by that one nice it was

418
00:14:57,399 --> 00:15:02,000
it wasn't the strongest stuff but was

419
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:03,559
[ __ ] it was tasty yeah we have few

420
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,480
like we have a pretty like deep history

421
00:15:03,559 --> 00:15:07,559
of blueberry here uh there is a lot of

422
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:09,440
blueberry that and we like like you said

423
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:11,958
we have we have two distinct kind

424
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,680
of types and it's obviously a thin a

425
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:16,799
thin like a narrow leaf and then a broad

426
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:19,799
leaf and both are great and I I was

427
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:21,439
keeping a couple that have narrow and

428
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:22,519
Broad and we had to narrow it down a

429
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,240
little bit like we were talking with the

430
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:25,720
catalog being narrowed down and I stuck

431
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,240
with a few of my favorites but there's a

432
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:29,199
couple Fraser Valley blueberries like

433
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:31,240
there's a a broadleaf

434
00:15:29,198 --> 00:15:33,078
the original broadleaf uh Fraser Valley

435
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:35,759
blueberry it's a harder plant to get now

436
00:15:33,078 --> 00:15:37,799
it's almost extinct I think uh it is

437
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:40,039
phenomenal and then there's a very kind

438
00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:42,559
of narrow Leaf sativa leaning uh

439
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:44,679
beautiful uh blueberry type sativa hash

440
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:46,559
plant that I held for a long time was

441
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:47,838
able to preserve and keep but it just

442
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:51,039
had a

443
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:52,480
absolutely like for me I like a really

444
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:54,559
potent stuff like potent High it just

445
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,319
had no hi to me really beautiful in

446
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:58,239
every other aspect great for breeding

447
00:15:56,318 --> 00:16:00,039
great for just experiencing very light

448
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,720
no burnout but just didn't have any

449
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:03,198
potency for me and it's funny you get

450
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:05,399
rid of things and then suddenly people

451
00:16:03,198 --> 00:16:07,318
are like that's what people want and so

452
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:08,879
like I've had to I've had to sadly be

453
00:16:07,318 --> 00:16:11,399
like I don't have that anymore like I

454
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:13,000
can get it but I don't have it it's kind

455
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:14,000
of a pain to find but yeah so we have

456
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,078
lots and then I have my favorite

457
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,078
blueberry which is uh my winie the blue

458
00:16:16,078 --> 00:16:21,679
which is my my Flagship blueberry cut

459
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:23,799
which I love so so tremendously much and

460
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:26,039
that has a little uh tribute to Winnipeg

461
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:28,519
rhy front because Winnie the Pooh was

462
00:16:26,039 --> 00:16:32,078
kind of born and bred in in Winnipeg

463
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:34,360
anoba like the the famous character and

464
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:37,519
so it was named after Wie the blue so or

465
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:39,680
Wie the poops awesome I love it and what

466
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:41,759
was the cross on the Winnie of the blue

467
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:44,799
so win of the blue comes from a lot of

468
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:46,839
my work and some of my early stock and

469
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:49,078
uh earlier things that I was able to be

470
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:52,199
so lucky to get comes from we had this

471
00:16:49,078 --> 00:16:54,479
group on the skunk magazine Forum uh

472
00:16:52,198 --> 00:16:56,120
this was probably about uh 10 or 12

473
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,959
years ago there was this really special

474
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:01,159
time uh skunk Forum skunk magazine had

475
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:03,599
this forum where there was people like

476
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:05,879
uh myself and I mean I was just a noob

477
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:09,318
but there was people like the riv there

478
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:10,720
uh snoow High um uh just some tremendous

479
00:17:09,318 --> 00:17:12,359
people and there was this elder a lot of

480
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,838
Elders too that were not known but were

481
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:16,438
really really influential in their own

482
00:17:13,838 --> 00:17:19,279
right uh this old-time Elder called Time

483
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:21,439
Tunnel and Time Tunnel um is just a

484
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:24,759
really really special guy and he had

485
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:26,919
some really amazing just amazing uh work

486
00:17:24,759 --> 00:17:29,279
and stuff that he had done over his

487
00:17:26,919 --> 00:17:31,038
history of loving this plant and uh he

488
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:33,038
was able to we were it was a really nice

489
00:17:31,038 --> 00:17:34,599
seed Exchange Place and so we exchanged

490
00:17:33,038 --> 00:17:37,558
seeds and he gave me um some original

491
00:17:34,599 --> 00:17:39,399
work called uh Time Tunnel zes blueberry

492
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:40,918
and at the time I was just you know

493
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,559
chasing everything blueberry and I ended

494
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:45,280
up running those seeds and we found this

495
00:17:42,558 --> 00:17:47,519
um amazing plant called uh that I called

496
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:49,279
wining the blue and uh actually right

497
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:50,960
now we're doing a just preserving the

498
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:52,119
line again doing some F3 work on it

499
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,480
right now and that's what I was sexing

500
00:17:52,119 --> 00:17:56,359
like I was telling you 13 minutes before

501
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,038
the show started still doing sex same

502
00:17:56,359 --> 00:18:00,319
work here before the show started so so

503
00:17:58,038 --> 00:18:02,319
we're doing some f3s now op f3s uh just

504
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:04,918
to preserve the line minimizing some

505
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:07,599
things out of bit but going to do a um a

506
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:09,520
pretty good op op I'm hoping to do maybe

507
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:11,519
15 females what we're down to and

508
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:13,400
probably about eight or nine males we're

509
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:15,079
just kind of eliminating eliminating

510
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,360
some things right now that we're not I'm

511
00:18:15,079 --> 00:18:17,879
not really a fan of I'm trying to get

512
00:18:16,359 --> 00:18:19,639
rid of all the earlier flow and stuff in

513
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:21,559
the blueberry males and try to keep the

514
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:23,679
ones that are holding on to their their

515
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:25,599
pollen which is a first I usually like

516
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:26,720
putting both in the line but this time

517
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:28,119
around we're going to try to eliminate

518
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,519
some of those ones that drop PA a little

519
00:18:28,119 --> 00:18:31,239
bit

520
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:33,279
so we're going to give a few packs of

521
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:35,159
your seeds away at the end of the show

522
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:37,359
as well two packs are going to go to our

523
00:18:35,159 --> 00:18:39,200
members one pack is going to come to

524
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:40,918
anybody that came to watch this show

525
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,000
we're going to roll little roulette

526
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:44,799
wheel and you guys will get some seeds I

527
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,839
was looking at these ones that you

528
00:18:44,798 --> 00:18:51,319
donated for us which by the way again

529
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:53,720
thank you so much Beyond generous man um

530
00:18:51,319 --> 00:18:56,678
honor man but how does the Winnie the

531
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:58,798
blue differ from the Dennis the

532
00:18:56,679 --> 00:19:01,240
Menace so Winnie the BL blue is the

533
00:18:58,798 --> 00:19:02,639
female is a female 80s blueberry uh from

534
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:04,519
Time Tunnel so like I said that's my

535
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,520
Flagship blueberry strain that's the one

536
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:08,158
that I found and you can go see the

537
00:19:06,519 --> 00:19:10,839
actual documentation of it which is

538
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:13,559
really cool on IC mag uh there's a IC

539
00:19:10,839 --> 00:19:15,359
mag thread called uh pollen bombing

540
00:19:13,558 --> 00:19:17,960
episode one because I'm also a huge Star

541
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:19,279
Wars geek and uh it's a really cool

542
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,600
thing just to go back and see some of

543
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:21,879
the old work that you do and it was all

544
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:23,759
preserved there so you can kind of go

545
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:25,840
back and see some of the you actually

546
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:28,279
see the run where Winnie was found um

547
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:29,879
but Winnie the blue is the female 80s uh

548
00:19:28,279 --> 00:19:32,359
Time Tunnel blueberry and then like I

549
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:35,360
had mentioned I was a blueberry fanatic

550
00:19:32,359 --> 00:19:37,319
early on and so once those commercial

551
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:38,918
crops started I had always been looking

552
00:19:37,319 --> 00:19:40,359
at magazines buying seeds and I started

553
00:19:38,919 --> 00:19:41,880
really buying anything I could buy for

554
00:19:40,359 --> 00:19:43,839
DJ Short Blueberry or any type of

555
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:46,120
blueberry cross and so we ended up

556
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:50,038
buying some earlier seeds from DJ and uh

557
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:52,319
Dennis and Menace was a variety or a

558
00:19:50,038 --> 00:19:54,839
phenotype I found in some old DJ

559
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:57,319
blueberry seeds so not like old not like

560
00:19:54,839 --> 00:20:00,959
everyone's like pre98 pre98 like no this

561
00:19:57,319 --> 00:20:02,279
is like early 2000s probably 2005 2006

562
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,759
so the line was still pretty decent at

563
00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:05,879
the time we were still getting some like

564
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:08,798
really nice blueberry fenos uh long

565
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:11,280
before the you know the LOM and the

566
00:20:08,798 --> 00:20:12,839
Sandy LOM and the musky and the like

567
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:15,000
pork wine and all that sort of like

568
00:20:12,839 --> 00:20:16,759
Flavor took over the line this still a

569
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,279
lot of blueberry so we found this really

570
00:20:16,759 --> 00:20:21,798
nice blueberry mail and I named uh this

571
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:25,158
blueberry cut that I I used for for

572
00:20:21,798 --> 00:20:27,158
years in my in my earlier blueberry work

573
00:20:25,159 --> 00:20:28,919
um Dennis and Menace and my

574
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:31,520
father-in-law

575
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:33,720
Dennis was a real awesome guy but he was

576
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:35,240
also a menace and so we Nam it after him

577
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:38,440
Dennis and Menace and he passed away so

578
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:40,359
rest in peace so but

579
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:42,159
yeah that's awesome yeah and that's the

580
00:20:40,359 --> 00:20:43,959
difference so one's female different

581
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:45,679
line Al together and there was some

582
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:48,798
projects done with both but Winnie the

583
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:50,480
blue over the years stayed uh as the the

584
00:20:48,798 --> 00:20:53,079
library got narrowed down because it's

585
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:55,079
my Flagship I just there's no blueberry

586
00:20:53,079 --> 00:20:58,199
plant I've experienced to this day that

587
00:20:55,079 --> 00:21:01,279
I I truly love and and cherish more it's

588
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:03,798
so special to me I I really want to dig

589
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:05,960
in and hear so much about that that

590
00:21:03,798 --> 00:21:08,639
Library I've heard you have an extensive

591
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:10,600
one and I'm sure there's a ton of things

592
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,278
that's going to tickle not only my goat

593
00:21:10,599 --> 00:21:14,480
but a lot of people that are in here as

594
00:21:12,278 --> 00:21:17,319
well because we got some older Growers

595
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:21,079
um sure before we get into that

596
00:21:17,319 --> 00:21:23,639
though what was the change between you

597
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:25,278
growing cannabis to breeding cannabis

598
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:29,480
was there a time Gap or it kind of

599
00:21:25,278 --> 00:21:31,720
coincide with each other I think just uh

600
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:34,079
like progression like for me like I

601
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:35,480
don't know I um I always like to I when

602
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:37,839
I get into something I get really into

603
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:39,720
something uh it's like that in in every

604
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:40,798
aspect it was like that with like drugs

605
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:44,519
it was like that with everything

606
00:21:40,798 --> 00:21:47,000
everything music uh so I I really just

607
00:21:44,519 --> 00:21:48,798
um and then for years like you said we

608
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,880
just look at the magazines and we're on

609
00:21:48,798 --> 00:21:53,599
the forums and we're just we're just

610
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,880
it's I don't know it's it's just seeing

611
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:57,798
it's seeing work and seeing other

612
00:21:54,880 --> 00:22:01,039
people's um drive and and dedication to

613
00:21:57,798 --> 00:22:02,720
their work work that yeah I just saw

614
00:22:01,038 --> 00:22:05,038
these cataloges and then started buying

615
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,480
seeds and then started doing you know I

616
00:22:05,038 --> 00:22:08,000
started taking some university courses

617
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,278
for my professional job that I end up

618
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,759
ended up with early on and a lot of it

619
00:22:10,278 --> 00:22:14,159
was science-based and so it was just

620
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:17,240
kind of went hand inand and so started

621
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:18,799
doing a little bit of like smaller hobby

622
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:20,400
stuff just to kind of make seed and and

623
00:22:18,798 --> 00:22:22,558
see what it see what I could do and and

624
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,798
what what we could find and then realize

625
00:22:22,558 --> 00:22:27,440
that like there's nothing more exciting

626
00:22:24,798 --> 00:22:30,319
now in my life than like making

627
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:32,400
selection and then putting them together

628
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:34,119
and then doing either like some some

629
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,278
small inline breeding or just running

630
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:37,959
pheno hunts like feno hunts to me to

631
00:22:36,278 --> 00:22:40,159
this day doing it now for for quite some

632
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:43,120
time like there's nothing more exciting

633
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:44,440
in the world than than a feno hunt like

634
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:46,639
especially when it's your own work like

635
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:48,640
I always say be your favorite breeder

636
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:51,679
like or be your favorite seed maker and

637
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:53,559
if you truly if you truly have a

638
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:56,440
calendar that's just filled with your

639
00:22:53,558 --> 00:22:59,960
own seed starts to me that's like you've

640
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:01,679
reached already the PIN that you know

641
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:04,079
every breeder or seed maker should reach

642
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:06,080
it's not about getting your seeds out

643
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:08,960
there to me it's not about you know

644
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:11,199
making money to me it's about loving the

645
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,759
work that you're doing enough that it is

646
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,278
always on the calendar of the seed

647
00:23:12,759 --> 00:23:16,798
starts like sure you start other

648
00:23:14,278 --> 00:23:18,558
people's work but the real excitement is

666
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,079
that is just there's no happier time in

667
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,000
the world of making seeds and running

668
00:23:58,079 --> 00:24:02,000
your work and looking at your lines and

669
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,240
you know making plans and goals from

670
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,880
that that that feno hunt like that is

671
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:08,599
the most special time and I have one

672
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:11,400
going on right now it's just it's a it's

673
00:24:08,599 --> 00:24:13,158
it's just electric it's just to me why

674
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:14,559
why you should be doing it and obviously

675
00:24:13,159 --> 00:24:17,640
getting it out and having other people

676
00:24:14,558 --> 00:24:19,200
experience it is just it's an honor and

677
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,960
it's just icing on the cake but it's

678
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,519
just like really at the end of the day

679
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:25,440
this should all be about your own

680
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:28,200
enjoyment of what you're doing or like

681
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:30,278
why do it like don't do it because you

682
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,798
want to make money or you wantan a

683
00:24:30,278 --> 00:24:34,200
following or you're trying to impress

684
00:24:31,798 --> 00:24:36,079
this guy or impress this group or crew

685
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:38,558
like it doesn't matter have fun man and

686
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:40,079
just like do what you want man and

687
00:24:38,558 --> 00:24:41,398
that's that's what it should be about so

688
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:43,038
and that's what it's been about been

689
00:24:41,398 --> 00:24:45,879
blessed for that but that was the

690
00:24:43,038 --> 00:24:49,000
progression was just seeing better and

691
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:51,399
better things as things went on like oh

692
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,480
my God I was kind of hoping this would

693
00:24:51,398 --> 00:24:54,759
this would be what I would see in this

694
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:56,798
little bit of work and little bit of

695
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:58,558
adjusting I did to this one line and I'm

696
00:24:56,798 --> 00:25:00,679
seeing that now not maybe in what I

697
00:24:58,558 --> 00:25:01,960
would like to see in the greater scheme

698
00:25:00,679 --> 00:25:04,080
but I'm just seeing little things that I

699
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:05,880
was hoping to see is now present in this

700
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:07,879
further work and so it just progression

701
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:10,960
progression progression and then as you

702
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:12,600
get more in tune with people in the

703
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:15,519
community and and better relationships

704
00:25:12,599 --> 00:25:16,798
form then it's just like I said I've

705
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:20,079
been so blessed not have to pay for

706
00:25:16,798 --> 00:25:22,599
seeds for so long and I had a raid where

707
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:24,798
I lost my seeds and so I had to rebuild

708
00:25:22,599 --> 00:25:28,079
and it was just literally because of

709
00:25:24,798 --> 00:25:30,639
these relationships you form with other

710
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:33,558
people who just love the plant love the

711
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:35,159
community love sharing want progression

712
00:25:33,558 --> 00:25:37,079
in friends and other breeders and other

713
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:39,080
seed makers aren't trying to hinder

714
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:41,079
anyone's progress it's just an open

715
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:43,079
sharing type community so I've been able

716
00:25:41,079 --> 00:25:44,798
to rebuild and with the better genetics

717
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:46,278
that come in you see better things

718
00:25:44,798 --> 00:25:48,278
better Line work and it's just a

719
00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:49,839
progression all the time and so it was

720
00:25:48,278 --> 00:25:51,159
really about just seeing that sort of

721
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:53,199
work and just wanting to do more and

722
00:25:51,159 --> 00:25:55,760
more and more and then also getting a

723
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,880
better catalog better access to genetics

724
00:25:55,759 --> 00:25:58,599
and then really at the end of the day

725
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,679
also kind of saving some money because

726
00:25:58,599 --> 00:26:02,199
there was a point there where and I'll

727
00:26:00,679 --> 00:26:04,120
never take a hit at anybody charging

728
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:05,480
$1,000 for their seeds if that's what

729
00:26:04,119 --> 00:26:07,199
you want to do man that's your that's

730
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:09,278
what you do but like there was some

731
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,519
seeds that people I knew were paying

732
00:26:09,278 --> 00:26:13,839
like $1,000 dollar for and you know even

733
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:15,679
up even up so so yeah it was a little

734
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:17,879
bit of everything to really progress and

735
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:19,679
to start doing the uh the breeding work

736
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:22,559

737
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:23,880

love working with the the chem family

766
00:27:29,079 --> 00:27:33,119
because it brings that that really heavy

767
00:27:31,558 --> 00:27:34,960
potency and some of those traits like

768
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:38,239
the uh that you see in like you know the

769
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:41,558
sours and the the the rubbers and the

770
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:43,720
like the skunky notes and this the you

potency and so I find this stuff is just

773
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:51,360
uh it's right on my alley man yeah

774
00:27:48,919 --> 00:27:52,919
that's my type of stuff too um I've

775
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:54,798
never worked with any of it I've worked

776
00:27:52,919 --> 00:27:56,919
with skunks but I've never worked with

777
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:59,679
the Kims I heard they were really picky

778
00:27:56,919 --> 00:28:02,360
I did not want want to start with pain

779
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:05,640
they're real pain but like the 91 like

780
00:28:02,359 --> 00:28:08,359
the 91 to me is um and just like I said

781
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:09,880
I have no place in this plant it's just

782
00:28:08,359 --> 00:28:11,719
been something that's found its way

783
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:14,039
towards me and I've been blessed enough

784
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:15,679
to hold and I'll always say that all the

785
00:28:14,038 --> 00:28:18,200
shadows and the accolades to these guys

786

787
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:21,278

of it now that you can find some really

810
00:29:06,398 --> 00:29:10,558
amazing flavors in this uh in all this

811
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:13,079
new stuff that's kind of about right now

812
00:29:10,558 --> 00:29:15,240
and been around for a while I'm 100%

813
00:29:13,079 --> 00:29:17,319
with you because just like I told you

814
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:19,679
I'm really into skunks I'm really into

815
00:29:17,319 --> 00:29:23,038
chems I even like a good

816
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:26,080
OG yeah if I had the choice I would only

817
00:29:23,038 --> 00:29:28,879
choose fruity about 25% of the time

818
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:30,519
probably yeah and I'm I'm with you one

819
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:32,559
of my favorite breeders up to this point

820
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:36,159
has been Dynasty genetics which does

821
00:29:32,558 --> 00:29:37,398
like a lot of fruit you know so if I am

822
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:40,600
going to go that way I'm going to go

823
00:29:37,398 --> 00:29:45,038
that way but my thing more than anything

824
00:29:40,599 --> 00:29:46,918
um is pheno hunting land races so that's

825
00:29:45,038 --> 00:29:49,960
why I'm not as scared anymore to work

826
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:53,360
with the chems as I was before I did

827
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:57,319
want to get some uh some thoughts

828
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:58,719
directly from you have you ever had a

829
00:29:57,319 --> 00:30:01,519
failed breeding

830
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:03,240
project where you just scrapped it

831
00:30:01,519 --> 00:30:04,919
there's so many that you just scrap

832
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:06,359
that's the problem with it and then what

833
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:08,759
do you do with those seeds right you

834
00:30:06,359 --> 00:30:10,719
just have this like [ __ ] fridge full

835
00:30:08,759 --> 00:30:12,480
of [ __ ] and like right one of the most

836
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,079
legendary dudes archive I mean he's got

837
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,558
some funny stories where he's just like

838
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:17,439
he's got fridges of stuff and I mean

839
00:30:15,558 --> 00:30:18,678
archive is amazing he's got I mean I

840
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,080
would find it hard to believe that he's

841
00:30:18,679 --> 00:30:22,000
got anything sitting around that's not

842
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:24,918
amazing but I mean like yeah I mean

843
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:27,919
there's you know it's hard I just I just

844
00:30:24,919 --> 00:30:30,080
kill them like I just get rid of them or

845
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:32,278
you know sometimes people are just like

846
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:34,439
they want to grow a large population of

847
00:30:32,278 --> 00:30:35,759
something and they just want to do it

848
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:37,240
and they don't want to pay for seeds and

849
00:30:35,759 --> 00:30:39,759
so you just explained to them like dude

850
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:41,720
I can give you a bunch of seeds but they

851
00:30:39,759 --> 00:30:43,359
didn't turn out the way I like them and

852
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:45,200
they they have this kind of negative

853
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:48,000
thing that's why I didn't want it and

854
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:49,399
you know but of course I have a lot of

855
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,079
stuff that has just been scrapped and

856
00:30:49,398 --> 00:30:55,359
that's part of it so what would you say

857
00:30:52,079 --> 00:30:58,398
to somebody that's newer newer to

858
00:30:55,359 --> 00:31:00,079
breeding um that had a failed project or

859
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:02,599
whatever and that was really

860
00:31:00,079 --> 00:31:05,319
disheartening uh to them coming from

861
00:31:02,599 --> 00:31:08,599
your standpoint it seems like to this

862
00:31:05,319 --> 00:31:12,398
day you going through feno hunts is a

863
00:31:08,599 --> 00:31:13,839
huge lot in life that brings you Joy um

864
00:31:12,398 --> 00:31:17,278
how do you continue on with that

865
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:17,278
attitude after filal

866
00:31:18,319 --> 00:31:21,839
projects well you just have to get into

867
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:24,159
this knowing that you're getting into

868
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:26,119
something like breeding you're working

869
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:27,960
with you're working with things that you

870
00:31:26,119 --> 00:31:29,439
don't really get to see into until all

871
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:32,200
this work is invested in it right it's

872
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:33,960
kind of like any art form so you really

873
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:36,000
have to have a passion for it and have

874
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:39,120
to understand getting into this that

875
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:41,079
dude it's like I said you you you can go

876
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:42,798
broke doing this like you know even

877
00:31:41,079 --> 00:31:44,918
though people might you might have a

878
00:31:42,798 --> 00:31:46,879
following or people have a following I

879
00:31:44,919 --> 00:31:49,600
mean you have to understand there is

880
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:51,840
huge things that you give up to do this

881
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:53,558
like it's not a uh it's not a fun job

882
00:31:51,839 --> 00:31:55,480
like just running a commercial Garden or

883
00:31:53,558 --> 00:31:57,440
a a connoisseur Garden if you want to

884
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:59,679
use that term where you're growing you

885
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:02,278
know 100 plants and you're you're

886
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:03,679
growing 25 you're growing four different

887
00:32:02,278 --> 00:32:04,679
plant or four different cultivar or

888
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:07,000
whatever it is you're growing this

889
00:32:04,679 --> 00:32:08,440
amazing always exciting beautiful

890
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,519
flowers and you're processing these

891
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:12,000
beautiful flowers whether you're making

892
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:14,839
hash or flower whatever you're doing

893
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,720
usually yeah and Seed seeds is like can

894
00:32:14,839 --> 00:32:18,519
be really [ __ ] boring man and like

895
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:20,399
you know you can lose money doing it and

896
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:24,079
so it's part of the game man and so it's

897
00:32:20,398 --> 00:32:25,879
just like anyone that chooses whatever

898
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:27,678
pathway in this community I mean you

899
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:29,639
have to really sit back and in life and

900
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:31,440
just be like is this these are the pros

901
00:32:29,638 --> 00:32:33,599
these are the cons this is what can

902
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,880
happen negatively this is the positive

903
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:36,519
and you just have to figure if it's

904
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:38,120
something that you're going to do but

905
00:32:36,519 --> 00:32:40,558
make sure you understand getting into

906
00:32:38,119 --> 00:32:42,239
this you are going to have projects that

907
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:45,359
just stink and you're going to be like

908
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:47,440
[ __ ] I just wasted eight months

909
00:32:45,359 --> 00:32:50,719
pollinating you know keeping mothers

910
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:52,360
around uh taking clones of of phenotypes

911
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:55,200
that I thought might be awesome and they

912
00:32:52,359 --> 00:32:57,158
all just [ __ ] stink uh you know and

913
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:59,080
you learn from it but hopefully the

914
00:32:57,159 --> 00:33:00,919
doesn't happen as often as it it can

915
00:32:59,079 --> 00:33:03,000
happen and hopefully you're lucky enough

916
00:33:00,919 --> 00:33:05,720
to like bring some sort

917
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,398
of you know pre-int telligence to the

918
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:08,919
game where you did some reading and some

919
00:33:07,398 --> 00:33:10,278
research and some maybe some Theory

920
00:33:08,919 --> 00:33:11,440
based stuff and then you're applying it

921
00:33:10,278 --> 00:33:13,759
to your practice and it's just like

922
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:15,240
anything that just the more you apply

923
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:16,480
the more Theory makes sense the more

924
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:18,558
Theory you can add and the more

925
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,720
application you can get uh into your

926
00:33:18,558 --> 00:33:21,918
thing and get better and better and

927
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:24,519
better and like progressions always the

928
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:25,759
plan and so even if you're Notting don't

929
00:33:24,519 --> 00:33:27,440
quit like I said as long as you're

930
00:33:25,759 --> 00:33:28,960
having fun do it you could keep making

931
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:31,159
shitty shitty projects but as long as

932
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:33,720
you having fun I mean you know try not

933
00:33:31,159 --> 00:33:35,840
to share the shitty projects that was

934
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:38,919
directly for me thank

935
00:33:35,839 --> 00:33:41,119
you I got really lucky with my first few

936
00:33:38,919 --> 00:33:45,399
breeding projects they came out exactly

937
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:48,678
like I wanted to and I was on an

938
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:51,038
F3 and the the progyny in that group

939
00:33:48,679 --> 00:33:53,120
just sucked it was just two male

940
00:33:51,038 --> 00:33:55,240
dominant in the whole [ __ ] thing and

941
00:33:53,119 --> 00:33:57,319
it disheartened me so much I just didn't

942
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:59,599
even continue on with that line and I

943
00:33:57,319 --> 00:34:03,240
got people ask me to this day can I get

944
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:05,439
some of those seeds I'm like no I scrap

945
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:07,599
that [ __ ] I mean to me scrapping a

946
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:09,800
project because it's something that you

947
00:34:07,599 --> 00:34:12,319
don't want versus something that's

948
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:14,119
problematic is different like you can

949
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:16,320
there's definitely I have like I have so

950
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:18,320
many projects in the fridge that like

951
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:20,440
there's no problems with it but they're

952
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:22,359
just not like I want it accurate and it

953
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:24,119
turned out fruity or I wanted short

954
00:34:22,358 --> 00:34:26,239
plants and they turned out tall like

955
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:28,480
stuff like that that I'm I'm still

956
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:30,398
holding on to I'm happy to give away in

957
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:32,039
large amounts to people that need seeds

958
00:34:30,398 --> 00:34:33,878
but again I always explain like hey

959
00:34:32,039 --> 00:34:36,159
they're they're not what I wanted that's

960
00:34:33,878 --> 00:34:37,358
why I'm giving them to you for you know

961
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:40,280
your for whatever you want to do with

962
00:34:37,358 --> 00:34:43,119
them so but no I definitely hear you man

963
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:45,399
so that that's a good perspective to

964
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:47,240
have on it it wasn't really problematic

965
00:34:45,398 --> 00:34:49,358
I just made the wrong selection I need

966
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:52,799
to go back and rework it at that point I

967
00:34:49,358 --> 00:34:55,039
had no idea or didn't even think to use

968
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:57,320
multiple males and isolate the pollen on

969
00:34:55,039 --> 00:35:00,279
different branches or anything like that

970
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:00,280
yeah one

971
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:05,559
run but like I said you learn right and

972
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:07,000
then you reformulate and you replan and

973
00:35:05,559 --> 00:35:08,960
then you do something again or you do it

974
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,838
over again right with better success and

975
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:14,519
one of the big things adjustments was uh

976
00:35:11,838 --> 00:35:17,078
doing uh S1 work and so you do regular

977
00:35:14,519 --> 00:35:20,000
breeding with regular males for you know

978
00:35:17,079 --> 00:35:22,000
a long time and then you suddenly are

979
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,039
tasked with learning something new and

980
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,320
you know hopefully you you have some

981
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:27,920
sense and it it's easy to kind of take

982
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:29,800
on the theory which it was and then you

983
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:31,800
got to apply it and so one thing with

984
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:33,280
selfing is doesn't matter who's doing

985
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,880
the selfing what breeder it is they

986
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:37,839
could be the best and you just sometimes

987
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:40,079
run into issues and it's just you know

988
00:35:37,838 --> 00:35:41,880
it's it's part of that kind of Realm of

989
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:43,560
of of making seeds with with selfing

990
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,880
projects and everyone struggles with it

991
00:35:43,559 --> 00:35:47,400
I've heard the best of the best talk

992
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:49,280
about it and I just had a problem here I

993
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:52,280
was trying to do a whole room with a

994
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:55,040
certain female that was uh or a certain

995
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:57,040
uh reverse plant and uh it just did not

996
00:35:55,039 --> 00:35:59,119
draw pollen and I had a time frame iom

997
00:35:57,039 --> 00:36:00,679
was really trying to stick to and so

998
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:01,920
thank God you have some backup stuff

999
00:36:00,679 --> 00:36:04,318
that you've collected that you know you

1000
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,880
can use in case you need a backup and so

1001
00:36:04,318 --> 00:36:07,079
yeah we changed from a chem dog room we

1002
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:08,160
went to a blueberry room and so

1003
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:10,160
everything got hit with blueberry

1004
00:36:08,159 --> 00:36:14,279
instead so you know and that's just the

1005
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:15,960
way it is so yeah part of it damn I'm

1006
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:17,920
learning on this episode I hope

1007
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:21,880
everybody over there in chat is holy

1008
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:24,519
[ __ ] so let's dig in a little bit more

1009
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:26,880
to this library that you've collected

1010
00:36:24,519 --> 00:36:28,318
over all these years actually actually

1011
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:30,920
let's go back really quick because I

1012
00:36:28,318 --> 00:36:32,838
can't say that I there's no way I can go

1013
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:35,760
over it and say I missed it so can we

1014
00:36:32,838 --> 00:36:40,559
talk about the raid or not oh for sure

1015
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:42,400
man yeah so for sure so we Canada so

1016
00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:47,440
Canada legalized in

1017
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:50,280
2016 I think it was uh October of 2016 I

1018
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:51,599
should know but I [ __ ] sometimes you

1019
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:54,400
don't remember things but I think it was

1020
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:56,720
September October 2016 Canada legalized

1021
00:36:54,400 --> 00:37:01,200
I had been growing um I had been a nurse

1022
00:36:56,719 --> 00:37:04,358
for uh almost a decade and was growing

1023
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:06,799
pot uh for my own medical consumption

1024
00:37:04,358 --> 00:37:08,799
and uh part of my University as nursing

1025
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:11,359
was I really really gravitated towards

1026
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:13,800
nursing law and like justice and so part

1027
00:37:11,358 --> 00:37:15,598
of that was learning about um harm

1028
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:17,119
reduction and things like that and I

1029
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:22,559
come from

1030
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:26,079
2016 2016 yes legalization was 2016

1031
00:37:22,559 --> 00:37:28,838
too all right that I know so yeah raid

1032
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:30,440
was a same 2016 but yeah so part of the

1033
00:37:28,838 --> 00:37:33,759
nursing

1034
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:35,960
um sorry I got interrupted but yeah raid

1035
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:38,040
was 2016 so I was a nurse at the time

1036
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:39,880
and I just didn't want to get I I I felt

1037
00:37:38,039 --> 00:37:42,639
that it was just

1038
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:44,160
um it wasn't right to have to go so the

1039
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:46,598
way it worked is you had to get a doctor

1040
00:37:44,159 --> 00:37:47,799
to sign for your medical and uh the only

1041
00:37:46,599 --> 00:37:49,920
way you could really get a medical in

1042
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:52,720
Canada at the time was you had to have

1043
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:53,680
like like a really terrible ailment like

1044
00:37:52,719 --> 00:37:56,838
you have to have like some sort of

1045
00:37:53,679 --> 00:37:58,239
wasting disorder from either uh AIDS or

1046
00:37:56,838 --> 00:37:59,679
a cancer diagnosis where you were

1047
00:37:58,239 --> 00:38:02,439
getting something for for for your

1048
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:04,440
symptom management right and so I suffer

1049
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:06,599
from horrible anxiety depression and

1050
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:08,119
have for my entire life and I just

1051
00:38:06,599 --> 00:38:09,200
couldn't get signage from a doctor and

1052
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:10,680
the only way I could do it was I have to

1053
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:13,039
go to BC to get a signage and you have

1054
00:38:10,679 --> 00:38:14,759
to pay $5,000 you see a doctor who

1055
00:38:13,039 --> 00:38:16,480
doesn't even know you and just signs you

1056
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:18,160
a paper right and so I was growing

1057
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:20,358
illegally but I was quite okay with it

1058
00:38:18,159 --> 00:38:21,920
because I knew I wasn't breaking I

1059
00:38:20,358 --> 00:38:23,960
wasn't hurting anybody I was applying my

1060
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:25,159
own medicine and I was really doing my

1061
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:26,119
own thing while I was while I was a

1062
00:38:25,159 --> 00:38:27,598
nurse and going through my nursing

1063
00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:30,240
school but for the the part of my

1064
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:32,000
nursing career and so 2016 rolled around

1065
00:38:30,239 --> 00:38:36,439
legalization was literally around the

1066
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:39,880
corner in uh in October and September uh

1067
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:42,358
my wife and I were leaving the house uh

1068
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:44,760
and uh boom we got arrested I mean we

1069
00:38:42,358 --> 00:38:46,519
got arrested so we got arrested there

1070
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:48,960
and then a raid followed obviously so

1071
00:38:46,519 --> 00:38:50,679
they raided my house and uh they had

1072
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:53,199
been following or watching our house for

1073
00:38:50,679 --> 00:38:54,799
about a week and it was all based on a I

1074
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:56,358
have great neighbors I live in a great

1075
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,640
Community it's like a really awesome

1076
00:38:56,358 --> 00:39:00,559
like middle class Place everyone's

1077
00:38:57,639 --> 00:39:02,879
really friendly uh and I uh I used to do

1078
00:39:00,559 --> 00:39:05,480
everything I could to mask smell but I

1079
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:07,480
mean I'm growing really [ __ ] stinky

1080
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:08,760
plants and I'm doing everything I can

1081
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:10,079
like going above and beyond charcoal

1082
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:12,240
filters but I'm coming up with my own

1083
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:14,560
homemade things to like dryer sheets

1084
00:39:12,239 --> 00:39:15,959
outside and owna own a tanks and just

1085
00:39:14,559 --> 00:39:17,719
everything you can imagine but there's

1086
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:19,079
still a bit of an odor and so someone

1087
00:39:17,719 --> 00:39:20,799
kept complaining about smell one

1088
00:39:19,079 --> 00:39:23,240
neighbor and it's more of like a a

1089
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:25,000
business and so it's really not people

1090
00:39:23,239 --> 00:39:26,838
that live here but it's just you know

1091
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:30,000
they seem inconvenience with this SM at

1092
00:39:26,838 --> 00:39:31,279
their business and so kept complaining

1093
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,358
and then we started getting watched for

1094
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:36,920
about a week and then uh the raid hit

1095
00:39:34,358 --> 00:39:38,199
and so they had been they had been

1096
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:39,680
watching us for a week and they thought

1097
00:39:38,199 --> 00:39:41,399
they had a pretty big operation because

1098
00:39:39,679 --> 00:39:43,358
of the smell they were smelling it was

1099
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:44,480
quite pugging they they felt and so when

1100
00:39:43,358 --> 00:39:46,598
they raided us they were quite

1101
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:49,639
disappointed because like I said most of

1102
00:39:46,599 --> 00:39:51,599
my grow was always mother plants and and

1103
00:39:49,639 --> 00:39:53,838
a library of stuff that wasn't flowering

1104
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:55,079
so my flowering area was quite small but

1105
00:39:53,838 --> 00:39:56,960
yeah they hyperinflated everything in

1106
00:39:55,079 --> 00:39:58,680
the paper that it was a real big outfit

1107
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:01,720
and you know all this sort of bad stuff

1108
00:39:58,679 --> 00:40:04,279
but in that process I mean I lost all my

1109
00:40:01,719 --> 00:40:07,838
mother plants and my seed collection

1110
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:10,839
which at the time was I mean I I still I

1111
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:13,679
still get sad it's like losing something

1112
00:40:10,838 --> 00:40:14,880
that you just he never get back right so

1113
00:40:13,679 --> 00:40:18,000
yeah that was a raid and they like

1114
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:19,838
literally they arrested US I I I ended

1115
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,358
up having to we ended up spending you

1116
00:40:19,838 --> 00:40:25,078
know short of $100,000 for our legal

1117
00:40:22,358 --> 00:40:26,838
fight um I was ended up getting house

1118
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:28,240
arrest I was lucky really lucky to get

1119
00:40:26,838 --> 00:40:31,119
house arrest because at the time we had

1120
00:40:28,239 --> 00:40:32,279
mandatory minimums for growing and I was

1121
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:33,880
just a little bit under the the

1122
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:35,359
mandatory minimum for 5 years but there

1123
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:37,240
was still a mandatory minimum of a year

1124
00:40:35,358 --> 00:40:40,000
in prison and I was able to have a good

1125
00:40:37,239 --> 00:40:41,959
lawyer and really fight and pay and get

1126
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,480
six months house arrest or a year house

1127
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:46,000
arrest but six absolute and then yeah

1128
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:47,639
ended up walking away from nursing as a

1129
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,480
result of it because there was a fight

1130
00:40:47,639 --> 00:40:51,799
there for professional misconduct which

1131
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:53,960
is part of being a professional but uh

1132
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:55,519
yeah today I ended up uh and part of it

1133
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:57,480
was also getting some cannabis uh

1134
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:59,480
contracts in il legal world so it was a

1135
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:01,639
good transition and that's kind of how

1136
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:03,000
things played out but uh yeah it didn't

1137
00:41:01,639 --> 00:41:06,519
really stop me because I end up getting

1138
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,960
my ACM part ACM PR about uh two months

1139
00:41:06,519 --> 00:41:09,719
after the raid I finally broke down and

1140
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:11,960
was like okay this is serious so let's

1141
00:41:09,719 --> 00:41:15,919
get let's get some protection yeah and

1142
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:17,199
and and War happened the first time man

1143
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,440
yeah but I mean like a lot of us dealt

1144
00:41:17,199 --> 00:41:21,239
with it I was lucky I know friends that

1145
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:23,838
did five years for for cannabis

1146
00:41:21,239 --> 00:41:26,919
so well you know in my mind it's

1147
00:41:23,838 --> 00:41:28,599
horeshit for a day really

1148
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:30,318
like at the end of the day we're growing

1149
00:41:28,599 --> 00:41:33,400
a plant you won't you shouldn't be able

1150
00:41:30,318 --> 00:41:36,358
to arrest me for canis anymore than you

1151
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:38,599
can for a tomato for sure man and it and

1152
00:41:36,358 --> 00:41:40,559
it really like like I had a 16-year-old

1153
00:41:38,599 --> 00:41:42,480
daughter like and you know we were smart

1154
00:41:40,559 --> 00:41:44,519
like we're I have a we have a pretty

1155
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:46,240
pretty smart family like we knew there

1156
00:41:44,519 --> 00:41:47,920
was always potential and so like just

1157
00:41:46,239 --> 00:41:50,000
like a family makes a fire plan it's

1158
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:52,240
just so odd that when you're a cannabis

1159
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,000
family like you have to make a raid plan

1160
00:41:52,239 --> 00:41:56,598
but thank God we had because my daughter

1161
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:59,199
was just a trooper and my wife who is

1162
00:41:56,599 --> 00:42:01,599
the most I mean I like I owe everything

1163
00:41:59,199 --> 00:42:03,598
every everyone who who does this who

1164
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:05,599
makes this commitment like if if you

1165
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:06,880
have a partner in your life that that

1166
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:08,039
that's been with you through some of

1167
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:10,440
this stuff like she's been through my

1168
00:42:08,039 --> 00:42:13,759
RAID you just

1169
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:15,280
all everything is dedicated to them

1170
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:17,400
because like I wouldn't be here if it

1171
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:20,400
wasn't for her the the [ __ ] she did for

1172
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:22,720
me when the raid happened uh the the

1173
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:25,559
just seeing all that stuff my daughter

1174
00:42:22,719 --> 00:42:28,318
just how supportive they were how stoic

1175
00:42:25,559 --> 00:42:29,800
they were How brave they were it's just

1176
00:42:28,318 --> 00:42:31,920
you know if you have a partner that that

1177
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:33,400
stands beside you and you do what we do

1178
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:35,760
I mean like I said they're the real

1179
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:37,838
Allstar so but yeah it was so hard on

1180
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:39,720
our family man uh they just tear your

1181
00:42:37,838 --> 00:42:43,239
house apart and I remember my biggest

1182
00:42:39,719 --> 00:42:45,439
fear when I like was getting uh

1183
00:42:43,239 --> 00:42:46,959
interviewed as was like I thought they

1184
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:48,880
they not only they take all my plants

1185
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:50,358
but I thought they took all my soil and

1186
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:52,160
so I'm a living soil guy and I i' had

1187
00:42:50,358 --> 00:42:53,759
been like that is my like going on my

1188
00:42:52,159 --> 00:42:55,399
eth year at the time of making my living

1189
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:57,079
soil and so I was so worried out of all

1190
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:58,480
the things that was also gone with my

1191
00:42:57,079 --> 00:43:01,240
soil and remember they were just looking

1192
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:03,559
at me like I was [ __ ] insane that I

1193
00:43:01,239 --> 00:43:05,598
was worried about soil but yeah it was a

1194
00:43:03,559 --> 00:43:07,720
really uh scary time man it's still hard

1195
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:09,680
to get over so it's crazy it just

1196
00:43:07,719 --> 00:43:12,799
changes you you become a little bit more

1197
00:43:09,679 --> 00:43:15,279
like jaded that's a that's the word for

1198
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:17,200
it right there too j but this community

1199
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:20,440
the community came through I'm telling

1200
00:43:17,199 --> 00:43:23,759
you I got my license two months later

1201
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:25,440
[ __ ] had no seeds no clones left I

1202
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:27,359
tried to salvage like every story you

1203
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:29,000
hear I in the back alley I was able to

1204
00:43:27,358 --> 00:43:31,639
pull a couple [ __ ] clones off of dead

1205
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:35,358
mother that they forgot they [ __ ]

1206
00:43:31,639 --> 00:43:38,279
they RI me down man so but within within

1207
00:43:35,358 --> 00:43:40,159
two months I had every clone I had

1208
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:42,280
shared and and had at the time which was

1209
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:44,199
a pretty extensive library at the time

1210
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:45,960
not only that I have most of those seeds

1211
00:43:44,199 --> 00:43:47,759
that you know maybe there were some I

1212
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:49,880
couldn't get back but I still had stuff

1213
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:52,079
that was given to me that I knew came

1214
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:54,599
from other people's special special

1215
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:57,240
places that they would normally not part

1216
00:43:54,599 --> 00:43:58,800
with but it just shows the level of you

1217
00:43:57,239 --> 00:44:01,159
know if you're dialed into this

1218
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:03,559

1223
00:44:10,679 --> 00:44:14,558
from the [ __ ] so at the end of the day

1224

really quick because I've got all your

1228
00:44:20,719 --> 00:44:24,118
seeds here and I'm looking through some

1229
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:27,558
of these and there's some holy [ __ ]

1230
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:30,039
names in here there really is well like

1231
00:44:27,559 --> 00:44:32,680
I said lucky very lucky to have friends

and like very lucky to be trusted with

1233
00:44:32,679 --> 00:44:38,358
stuff man but like I said it goes two

1234
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:40,039
ways my favorite thing to do in life is

1235
00:44:38,358 --> 00:44:42,119
to be able to give something back to

1236
00:44:40,039 --> 00:44:43,960
somebody that they've lost and that's

1237
00:44:42,119 --> 00:44:45,680
that's the most I mean the most

1238
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:47,358
honorable thing and the most honored

1239
00:44:45,679 --> 00:44:49,118
thing you can feel is when someone

1240
00:44:47,358 --> 00:44:51,519
reaches out to you and they're like dude

1241
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:53,640
I lost my breeder cut of so and so and

1242
00:44:51,519 --> 00:44:56,079
you're like hey man just give me your

1243
00:44:53,639 --> 00:44:57,519
address it's out Monday so that's the

1244
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:59,680
coolest thing but yeah it's just the

1245
00:44:57,519 --> 00:45:01,800
circle of blessing man like you you got

1246
00:44:59,679 --> 00:45:03,759
to really put that time and and

1247
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:05,800
investment and Trust in and then it pays

1248
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:07,280
back man and it's just that reciprocal

1249
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:09,480
awesome thing that this community

1250
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:12,680
produces it's so unlike any other

1251
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:14,920
community we don't have to name we don't

1252
00:45:12,679 --> 00:45:17,440
if you want to you think you can do that

1253
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:20,159
you wanna we can of course we can talk

1254
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:22,000
your voice you just talk I'll I'll

1255
00:45:20,159 --> 00:45:25,078
answer whatever you got there whatever

1256
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:28,039
you I was just gonna ask you uh name

1257
00:45:25,079 --> 00:45:30,519
like your top five favorite

1258
00:45:28,039 --> 00:45:32,558
but it's up to you you run through the

1259
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:34,880
list run through the list I mean I could

1260
00:45:32,559 --> 00:45:36,839
name my top five for sure so I mean like

1261
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:40,119
obviously my favorite plant of all time

1262
00:45:36,838 --> 00:45:41,719
is the kmog 91 it's all-time favorite

1263
00:45:40,119 --> 00:45:44,000
and like I said I have no hand on that

1264
00:45:41,719 --> 00:45:45,959
plant I'm just lucky we don't got to ask

1265
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,559
the desert island question that's it for

1266
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:50,800
you yeah I mean like grown well though

1267
00:45:48,559 --> 00:45:52,599
because like it can be grown it can be

1268
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:54,559
butchered like it needs to be really

1269
00:45:52,599 --> 00:45:57,519
well grown and that comes with really

1270
00:45:54,559 --> 00:46:00,079
getting to know her well and like I said

1271
00:45:57,519 --> 00:46:02,079
I just am lucky to be a steward to her

1272
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:04,640
like I have no hand in this plan I just

1273
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:06,160
affected me in a way that I was lucky to

1274
00:46:04,639 --> 00:46:10,039
be able to experience so that's my

1275
00:46:06,159 --> 00:46:14,639
number one I mean I really am a huge fan

1276
00:46:10,039 --> 00:46:16,079
of uh like Canadian Kush plants or like

1277
00:46:14,639 --> 00:46:18,879
like we have a few that kick around here

1278
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:20,880
so like I'm a huge fan of like and I

1279
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:23,119
mean obviously like these plants

1280
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:24,880
originated in the US so we can't take

1281
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:26,680
any credit for it but like purple kush

1282
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:28,039
the original Purple Kush

1283
00:46:26,679 --> 00:46:31,919
like there's a there's a few of those

1284
00:46:28,039 --> 00:46:34,239
original cuts that that to me are just

1285
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:37,039
phenomenal yeah and there's a Canadian

1286
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:40,799
guy uh direwolf who's just like a true

1287
00:46:37,039 --> 00:46:44,519
OG too he's amazing guy in so many ways

1288
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:46,480
uh he he's got a really special uh uh

1289
00:46:44,519 --> 00:46:48,519
clone only of a purple kush that I think

1290
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:51,199
is probably the best Purple Kush cut

1291
00:46:48,519 --> 00:46:52,239
I've ever consumed it's just phenomenal

1292
00:46:51,199 --> 00:46:53,759
and then there's like you know some

1293
00:46:52,239 --> 00:46:56,759
certain some other cuts too like

1294
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:59,520
Garberville and there's the uh there's a

1295
00:46:56,760 --> 00:47:00,960
few with the SF and uh just a whole

1296
00:46:59,519 --> 00:47:02,960
bunch of stuff but Purple Kush and then

1297
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:05,280
we have a famous cut Here Pink Kush

1298
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:07,880
which is like people will tease you if

1299
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:10,079
you like it like because it's so [ __ ]

1300
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:12,280
well known here and everybody is just

1301
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:13,920
like done with it like oh no more pink

1302
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:16,079
Kush but I don't care what anyone says

1303
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:19,200
it's such a special plant so that I love

1304
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:21,880
the master yeah Master Kush to me like

1305
00:47:19,199 --> 00:47:23,558
the there's two two uh really well-known

1306
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:26,000
fenal of Master there's like the short

1307
00:47:23,559 --> 00:47:27,640
one that's hard really hard to find

1308
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,880
there's a tall lankier master I love the

1309
00:47:27,639 --> 00:47:32,679
tall lanky Master Kush uh and then I'm

1310
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:34,880
an OG like I mean to me the best plants

1311
00:47:32,679 --> 00:47:36,358
are ogs too so there's some OG plants

1312
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:37,480
that I really really cherish we have a

1313
00:47:36,358 --> 00:47:40,199
couple Canadian ones here there's like

1314
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:42,358
Roi OG which like a purple Cali OG it's

1315
00:47:40,199 --> 00:47:44,480
really good and then like the obviously

1316
00:47:42,358 --> 00:47:45,759
like the the the American ogs are the

1317
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:47,719
best but yeah I guess it's really hard

1318
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:49,839
to narrow five down I don't know if I

1319
00:47:47,719 --> 00:47:52,318
could do it actually yeah no I can't but

1320
00:47:49,838 --> 00:47:55,759
those are like I'm stuck on OG now

1321
00:47:52,318 --> 00:47:57,400
because I wasn't expecting that so out

1322
00:47:55,760 --> 00:48:00,720
are your ogs what what would be top

1323
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:04,639
three ogs I think uh probably the best

1324
00:48:00,719 --> 00:48:06,399
OG that I've ever consumed I was able

1325
00:48:04,639 --> 00:48:09,318
just to finally get and that would

1326
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:12,079
probably be like the M1 OG or the

1327
00:48:09,318 --> 00:48:15,519
SBS so like the sour best [ __ ] ever also

1328
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:17,318
known as like my number one OG the M1 OG

1329
00:48:15,519 --> 00:48:20,239
uh which I think is it's it's true its

1330
00:48:17,318 --> 00:48:23,400
true name that to me is um really really

1331
00:48:20,239 --> 00:48:26,799
special and then I'm finding to like um

1332
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:29,639
we have this Canadian uh OG cut which is

1333
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:31,280
Roi OG and it's only called Roi OG

1334
00:48:29,639 --> 00:48:33,239
because there's a a producer of

1335
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:35,240
concentrates in BC called Roi

1336
00:48:33,239 --> 00:48:37,679
concentrates and he got his hand on this

1337
00:48:35,239 --> 00:48:39,479
cut so no one seems to really know what

1338
00:48:37,679 --> 00:48:41,759
it is but it comes from California and

1339
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:43,559
it's just got this really light purple

1340
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:47,200
coloring to it but it's just got this

1341
00:48:43,559 --> 00:48:48,240
tremendous gas flavor that I really like

1342
00:48:47,199 --> 00:48:50,439
and then you know there's all your

1343
00:48:48,239 --> 00:48:53,959
Classics like San Fernando ghost but

1344
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:55,119
like I don't hold all of those um but

1345
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:56,599
those are the probably my favorite ones

1346
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:59,920
that I hold

1347
00:48:56,599 --> 00:49:01,880
I got about the Irene at all yeah I mean

1348
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:03,318
the Irene is there's a couple guys in

1349
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:05,640
Canada that have done a lot of work with

1350
00:49:03,318 --> 00:49:08,558
it and really really enjoy it uh a few

1351
00:49:05,639 --> 00:49:10,920
friends hold it um but like I said it's

1352
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:13,240
uh it's it's it's something that's being

1353
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:14,798
really enjoyed and and used by a couple

1354
00:49:13,239 --> 00:49:16,078
people that I know that are either doing

1355
00:49:14,798 --> 00:49:18,119
work with it or they're they're doing

1356
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:20,318
something with it so I know it's

1357
00:49:18,119 --> 00:49:22,318
tremendous it's phenomenal but it's just

1358
00:49:20,318 --> 00:49:24,239
not something that I I hold or work with

1359
00:49:22,318 --> 00:49:25,798
it but I know that it's it's a it's a

1360
00:49:24,239 --> 00:49:28,719
legend in its own right and it's here

1361
00:49:25,798 --> 00:49:31,239
it's floats around for sure the I

1362
00:49:28,719 --> 00:49:33,679
noticed you mentioned archive earlier I

1363
00:49:31,239 --> 00:49:35,719
think one of my favorite ogs was the rud

1364
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:39,078
boy that he made there's just something

1365
00:49:35,719 --> 00:49:41,358
about that that's it's a floral OG but

1366
00:49:39,079 --> 00:49:43,440
right that's what makes it original to

1367
00:49:41,358 --> 00:49:45,719
me you know it's got still got OG

1368
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:48,519
properties to it but I love that flavor

1369
00:49:45,719 --> 00:49:51,399
we have his Hazmat OG I think it's

1370
00:49:48,519 --> 00:49:54,440
archives does Hazmat so and that just

1371
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:56,680
came from another really special friend

1372
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:58,920
of mine who uh I'm really lucky to to

1373
00:49:56,679 --> 00:50:01,399
know from the US and he's a really

1374
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:03,760
influential guy in my library he's been

1375
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:05,838
so generous uh sending me some stuff

1376
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:07,160
that like you know I would never be able

1377
00:50:05,838 --> 00:50:09,400
to get my hands on if it wasn't for him

1378
00:50:07,159 --> 00:50:11,879
so I was just able to get uh some hmat

1379
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:13,798
OG uh cuts from him and they've been in

1380
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:15,200
quarantine and now they're out in the

1381
00:50:13,798 --> 00:50:17,639
bedroom they should be getting flowered

1382
00:50:15,199 --> 00:50:20,318
soon uh but I like I said he's a special

1383
00:50:17,639 --> 00:50:22,879
guy he always gets uh really special

1384
00:50:20,318 --> 00:50:24,920
hard to find us stuff that I'm just so

1385
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:28,160
lucky to get my hands on so and we also

1386
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:31,639
able to get just the um I guess it's the

1387
00:50:28,159 --> 00:50:33,719
the crinkle cut um Legend uh Legend Kush

1388
00:50:31,639 --> 00:50:35,358
Legend OG but Legend cush crinkle cut

1389
00:50:33,719 --> 00:50:37,039
and I think there's another grower on

1390
00:50:35,358 --> 00:50:39,119
Instagram I won't name drop but he grows

1391
00:50:37,039 --> 00:50:41,159
it quite quite well in his room and

1392
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:43,960
there's a really good threads of it on

1393
00:50:41,159 --> 00:50:45,318
IC mag and that's another cut that uh I

1394
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:47,000
just like I can't believe I got my hands

1395
00:50:45,318 --> 00:50:49,279
on that I'm able to to start working

1396
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:51,480
with so that thing to me is just uh

1397
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:53,839
unbelievable so that's the one with the

1398
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:55,480
leaves that like do the wave thing yeah

1399
00:50:53,838 --> 00:50:57,239
it's got a weird crinkle to it just like

1400
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:58,880
a distinctive feature kind of like uh

1401
00:50:57,239 --> 00:51:00,838
some other cuts that we that we know of

1402
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:02,798
that do that and it's uh but yeah it's

1403
00:51:00,838 --> 00:51:06,078
uh it's it's mistaken as an OG I think

1404
00:51:02,798 --> 00:51:09,159
there's a a chem dominant uh crinkle cut

1405
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:12,160
uh OG Kush but this is like a it's more

1406
00:51:09,159 --> 00:51:14,118
of a uh Legend Kush they call it like

1407
00:51:12,159 --> 00:51:16,879
the really guys who grow it and know it

1408
00:51:14,119 --> 00:51:18,519
really well versus OG so but it's really

1409
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:20,519
special like I mean really really

1410
00:51:18,519 --> 00:51:21,920
special I love and then I'm finding my

1411
00:51:20,519 --> 00:51:23,798
own and that's like I said that's that's

1412
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:25,760
been the really cool thing is um a lot

1413
00:51:23,798 --> 00:51:28,400
of the stuff um that I work with so I

1414
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:31,040
find working with the dog the 91 a lot

1415
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:33,838
of its its pairings or S1 work with it

1416
00:51:31,039 --> 00:51:36,440
like I love running large uh numbers of

1417
00:51:33,838 --> 00:51:38,358
Kim dog 91s ones because I find in that

1418
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:41,200
population like I have found things that

1419
00:51:38,358 --> 00:51:43,239
have become my favorite OG types or sour

1420
00:51:41,199 --> 00:51:45,199
type plants that I just haven't named

1421
00:51:43,239 --> 00:51:47,239
but they have like a number or a some

1422
00:51:45,199 --> 00:51:49,399
sort of marking in my garden that like I

1423
00:51:47,239 --> 00:51:51,239
just love so much I'm I'm smoking more

1424
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:52,358
than like the original mother like you

1425
00:51:51,239 --> 00:51:54,078
know cuz it's got a little bit more

1426
00:51:52,358 --> 00:51:55,598
bigger and it brings a little bit more

1427
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:56,839
flavor and it's just like you know it's

1428
00:51:55,599 --> 00:51:58,720
got the high but it's got a little bit

1429
00:51:56,838 --> 00:52:01,000
something else to it and now like I said

1430
00:51:58,719 --> 00:52:03,399
the carry uh the Siri chem line which is

1431
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:05,639
the Siri Paul is bringing that really

1432
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:08,440
special Afghan Pakistani um from the

1433
00:52:05,639 --> 00:52:10,239
mother I used to the to the 91 and so

1434
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:13,280
you're finding like all the traits that

1435
00:52:10,239 --> 00:52:15,639
I love in the 91 outcrosses and outlines

1436
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:17,519
but now I'm getting this amazing like

1437
00:52:15,639 --> 00:52:20,118
structure and and some some other

1438

but

1442
00:52:27,239 --> 00:52:32,519
yeah and so stuff like that is is Canada

1443
00:52:30,519 --> 00:52:34,119
so breeder Steve sweet skunk so everyone

1444
00:52:32,519 --> 00:52:36,480
knows breeder Steve and he has this

1445
00:52:34,119 --> 00:52:38,200
tremendous clone only sweet skunk it's

1446
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:40,599
not to be confused with Island sweet

1447
00:52:38,199 --> 00:52:43,759
skunk which is a seedline but breeder

1448
00:52:40,599 --> 00:52:47,280
Steve's Sweet skunk clone only is this

1449
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:49,880
beautiful Haze Type U cultivar that's

1450
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:52,440
very high pining it's got a beautiful

1451
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:55,000
Pine it's got really potent uh uh

it

1454
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:58,880
and uh it's just a tremendous plant and

1455
00:52:57,719 --> 00:53:00,399
it's like I said if you're able to get

1456
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:02,559
your hands on it and grow it it's one of

1457
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:04,880
these plants that like it's got that old

1458
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:07,000
school everything we love Long Legs

1459
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:10,079
great High great flavor great nose great

1460
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:12,838
effect and uh the Jihadi Kush was I'm

1461
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:14,839
lucky enough to uh to work with and have

1462
00:53:12,838 --> 00:53:17,199
uh Charles Scott as a a mentor of mine

1463
00:53:14,838 --> 00:53:19,199
and friend uh reeferman and we've been

1464
00:53:17,199 --> 00:53:22,039
friends for years I was a tester and and

1465
00:53:19,199 --> 00:53:24,199
and uh did some uh pictures for some of

1466
00:53:22,039 --> 00:53:25,480
his ads like years ago and so we've just

1467
00:53:24,199 --> 00:53:26,759
been buddies for a long time and he's

1468
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:29,000
traded a lot of stuff and given me a lot

1469
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:31,839
of stuff and he had this line jih Kush

1470
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:35,199
that he called jiot Kush and it was um

1471
00:53:31,838 --> 00:53:37,639
also like an a-pack nepes line so it had

1472
00:53:35,199 --> 00:53:41,039
some really nice kind of land race type

1473
00:53:37,639 --> 00:53:42,960
based uh origin type uh p1s to it and so

1474
00:53:41,039 --> 00:53:45,480
that line is really cool it's got this

1475
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:47,838
like hazy old school type uh uh clone

1476
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:50,280
only from Canada mixed with this like

1477
00:53:47,838 --> 00:53:53,039
Afghan pachy nepales uh line that

1478
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:54,760
reeferman did and the the siblings are

1479
00:53:53,039 --> 00:53:56,759
really interesting you get really kind

1480
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:59,280
of everything from across the board but

1481
00:53:56,760 --> 00:54:02,559
all old school kind of notes and flavors

1482
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:06,359
so tremendous as Joey Diaz would say

1483
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:09,680
tremendous one back off guys D yeah like

1484
00:54:06,358 --> 00:54:11,679
I mean you I mean like I said the fridge

1485
00:54:09,679 --> 00:54:13,838
is like I'm moving in so many new

1486
00:54:11,679 --> 00:54:15,480
directions with like doing the S1 work

1487
00:54:13,838 --> 00:54:17,480

1488
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:18,719
stuff that I have this fridge now of so

1489

much regular stuff that's just kind of

1490
00:54:18,719 --> 00:54:22,759
sitting around and so uh lately when

1491
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:25,639
I've been getting some some really

1492
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:28,000
awesome uh people that are are are

1493
00:54:25,639 --> 00:54:30,558
are grabbing larger amounts I just

1494

[ __ ] like yeah [ __ ] thank you so

1495
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:34,559
much man I just throw in like just a

1496
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:35,880
ridiculous amount of freebies of stuff

1497
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:37,440
that's just laying around so hit me up

1498
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:39,960
man for sure whatever you want extra

1499
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:41,639
I'll hit you up for sure I appreciate

1500
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:43,880
that more than anything man you have no

1501
00:54:41,639 --> 00:54:45,838
idea and likewise if there's anything I

1502
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:48,720
can get you I've got an extensive

1503
00:54:45,838 --> 00:54:50,358
Library sadly most of my stuff is mostly

1504
00:54:48,719 --> 00:54:52,919
land races but I got some good other

1505
00:54:50,358 --> 00:54:54,798
stuff too yeah but land race is great

1506
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:57,240
and for sure man we'll talk it's [ __ ]

1507
00:54:54,798 --> 00:54:59,318
Joy just won't go out I'm okay with

1508
00:54:57,239 --> 00:55:01,159
going through chems now is because I've

1509
00:54:59,318 --> 00:55:04,480
gone through a few different land race

1510
00:55:01,159 --> 00:55:07,399
feno hunts now and it doesn't take you

1511
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:10,119
more than a couple runs to realize most

1512
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:11,720
of this is trash and I'm lucky if I find

1513
00:55:10,119 --> 00:55:14,280
something that I really really like out

1514
00:55:11,719 --> 00:55:16,318
of it and then at that point I'm really

1515
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:20,200
really lucky if I find something that I

1516
00:55:16,318 --> 00:55:22,358
like that outcross as well yeah so

1517
00:55:20,199 --> 00:55:24,199
that's that's land races like I was in

1518
00:55:22,358 --> 00:55:25,960
this like I mean we all go through this

1519
00:55:24,199 --> 00:55:27,239
phase and some times longer than others

1520
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:29,440
and we were in a long phase I had

1521
00:55:27,239 --> 00:55:32,118
Partners in other um Crews that we had

1522
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:33,920
like my partner from uh golden uh or

1523
00:55:32,119 --> 00:55:35,640
from Green Bieber genetics we were on

1524
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:37,880
this kick for land race like we were

1525
00:55:35,639 --> 00:55:39,519
running everything we get our hands on

1526
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:43,000
and like land race is just what you said

1527
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:45,280
it's like generally it's it's unworked

1528
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:47,239
and it's just like it's it's hit or miss

1529
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:49,798
you got to run through so much to find a

1530
00:55:47,239 --> 00:55:51,879
gem but when you do find a gem it's a

1531
00:55:49,798 --> 00:55:53,079
[ __ ] Gem and a lot of the times you

1532
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:55,079
know if it's got some of the stuff

1533
00:55:53,079 --> 00:55:57,039
you're looking for in that line that you

1534
00:55:55,079 --> 00:56:00,318
were kind of either heard of or had

1535
00:55:57,039 --> 00:56:01,920
experienced early on sometimes they work

1536
00:56:00,318 --> 00:56:03,920
as tremendous breeding tools or

1537
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:05,798
outcrossing tools and the the stuff that

1538
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:07,720
you use them for you may not even

1539
00:56:05,798 --> 00:56:09,199
consume it that often but you do use it

1540
00:56:07,719 --> 00:56:11,639
and keep it around because it is such a

1541
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:13,798
treasure such an amazing tool to use in

1542
00:56:11,639 --> 00:56:15,960
in further things that you do so I have

1543
00:56:13,798 --> 00:56:17,759
a lot of stuff like that where I love to

1544
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:19,599
consume it but don't want to consume it

1545
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:21,960
every day oh yeah but definitely keep

1546
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:23,920
keep it around strictly because I love

1547
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:26,880
working with it I know its value and and

1548
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:30,559
using it to make things better in other

1549
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:33,240
projects so just being a hobby grower

1550
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:35,359
for many years I I found out pretty

1551
00:56:33,239 --> 00:56:38,639
quick that I really love growing work

1552
00:56:35,358 --> 00:56:40,960
lines of stuff that I love but some of

1553
00:56:38,639 --> 00:56:43,759
my favorite plants to grow were some

1554
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:45,559
like you said reeferman earlier uh snow

1555
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:47,839
High some of those guys that were doing

1556
00:56:45,559 --> 00:56:50,079
the early just straight hybrid work

1557
00:56:47,838 --> 00:56:52,199
before everything was poly hybridized

1558
00:56:50,079 --> 00:56:54,000
you know or at least fighting the the

1559
00:56:52,199 --> 00:56:56,519
poly hybrids that were there and just

1560
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,960
going back to good old classic hybrids

1561
00:56:56,519 --> 00:57:00,000
and some of those plants were like my

1562
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:01,440
favorite plants to grow and that was

1563
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,960
something that I was like I want to

1564
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:05,440
create that with different strains

1565
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:07,720
around the world that a lot of people

1566
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:10,240
aren't using you know something

1567
00:57:07,719 --> 00:57:13,519
different something new I I think

1568
00:57:10,239 --> 00:57:15,838
cannabis more than anything right now um

1569
00:57:13,519 --> 00:57:19,920
in the modern Market needs more

1570
00:57:15,838 --> 00:57:21,558
diversity than anything for sure yeah I

1571
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:23,119
mean we're I mean we're in a period

1572
00:57:21,559 --> 00:57:25,039
right now like I mean everyone complains

1573
00:57:23,119 --> 00:57:26,680
about it and like you know I don't I

1574
00:57:25,039 --> 00:57:29,760
don't like to Sho on any cut or any

1575
00:57:26,679 --> 00:57:33,558
variety or any strain like I love I mean

1576
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:35,000
cookies was so influential in my like

1577
00:57:33,559 --> 00:57:37,240
there was a period where I just like

1578
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:39,358
obsessed with cookies like I'm sure some

1579
00:57:37,239 --> 00:57:41,318
people were some people [ __ ] on it like

1580
00:57:39,358 --> 00:57:43,838
I'm not judging there's good cookies out

1581
00:57:41,318 --> 00:57:46,719
there everything's got a place I I'm

1582
00:57:43,838 --> 00:57:49,558
just speaking from a standpoint of how

1583
00:57:46,719 --> 00:57:51,000
much diversity we had back then and now

1584
00:57:49,559 --> 00:57:52,440
it feels like more people are just

1585
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:55,199
trying to get seeds out there by

1586
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:56,880
breeding the same families together and

1587
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:58,519
you know make it a little bit different

1588
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:00,079
because you got sick of this we'll bring

1589
00:57:58,519 --> 00:58:02,318
some new genetics into it and there's a

1590
00:58:00,079 --> 00:58:04,200
new line we have a legal Market here and

1591
00:58:02,318 --> 00:58:06,519
like if you look at the legal market

1592
00:58:04,199 --> 00:58:09,199
trends it's like it's I mean it's

1593
00:58:06,519 --> 00:58:12,639
literally saturated with like the same

1594
00:58:09,199 --> 00:58:14,759
the same looking the same like effect

1595
00:58:12,639 --> 00:58:16,759
the effect creating types of varieties

1596
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:19,880
that like we would all consider hype

1597
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:21,319
modern day strains but it's you know you

1598
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:22,798
just don't want to [ __ ] on anyone that's

1599
00:58:21,318 --> 00:58:24,358
making that type of stuff like cuz

1600
00:58:22,798 --> 00:58:26,920
what's happening is a lot of these um

1601
00:58:24,358 --> 00:58:29,880
Canadian places are buying clones now

1602
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:32,599
from American clone uh type places or

1603
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:34,519
places at Rabel to get like American

1604
00:58:32,599 --> 00:58:36,240
hype genetics into the Canadian scene

1605
00:58:34,519 --> 00:58:38,280
and now they're like that's all you see

1606
00:58:36,239 --> 00:58:40,279
here or they're buying like they're

1607
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:42,160
spending a fortune on like really good

1608
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:44,680
breeders work from the states but the

1609
00:58:42,159 --> 00:58:47,480
work is all kind of pushing towards that

1610
00:58:44,679 --> 00:58:49,399
direction of this like same saturated

1611
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:51,119
type of thing you're seeing where it's a

1612
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:52,358
lot of beautiful looking it all looks

1613
00:58:51,119 --> 00:58:54,358
the same and we all know what I'm

1614
00:58:52,358 --> 00:58:56,199
talking about like the type of structure

1615
00:58:54,358 --> 00:58:58,199
the bud structure the leaf structure

1616
00:58:56,199 --> 00:59:00,078
color it all looks the same it kind of

1617
00:58:58,199 --> 00:59:03,000
smokes the same it looks the same smells

1618
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:05,000
the same but I find it's got like we

1619
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:07,079
consume a lot of the the market just to

1620
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:08,599
see like what's going on and also we're

1621
00:59:07,079 --> 00:59:09,880
able to see some of the Clones that come

1622
00:59:08,599 --> 00:59:11,798
through from the states that are more of

1623
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:14,200
these hype clones like we've kept some

1624
00:59:11,798 --> 00:59:15,920
of them short term some we just pass on

1625
00:59:14,199 --> 00:59:17,598
some friends get it we smoke that so we

1626
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:19,039
get to experience a lot of them but I

1627
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:21,000
just like it's not something I really

1628
00:59:19,039 --> 00:59:22,880
want to consume very often they're nice

1629
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:25,159
but not something I want and I agree I

1630
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:28,760
just love the old school stuff that

1631
00:59:25,159 --> 00:59:30,519
you know has more longevity yeah like

1632
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:32,960
that we're all wanting to go back to or

1633
00:59:30,519 --> 00:59:34,639
this just continually recycles we're I

1634
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:37,798
don't know if this will recycle it just

1635
00:59:34,639 --> 00:59:41,038
continues to like saturate you know

1636
00:59:37,798 --> 00:59:42,838
flavor less constant Berry and constant

1637
00:59:41,039 --> 00:59:44,880
this and constant that I was talking to

1638
00:59:42,838 --> 00:59:46,719
breeder Steve not too long ago we did an

1639
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:48,760
episode with him and he hit the nail on

1640
00:59:46,719 --> 00:59:52,399
the head with me he said I don't know

1641
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:55,119
about you I've grown tens and hundreds

1642
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:59,680
of thousands of plants and he said all

1643
00:59:55,119 --> 01:00:01,240
of these 30 centers plus that's when

1644
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:03,078
they're all starting to kind of taste

1645
01:00:01,239 --> 01:00:05,279
the same you're getting really high

1646
01:00:03,079 --> 01:00:07,119
amounts of like THC in there and that's

1647
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:09,039
the dominant that we're breeding towards

1648
01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:11,880
and a lot of them are getting that

1649
01:00:09,039 --> 01:00:13,280
flavor yeah what are what are your

1650
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:15,920
thoughts on the modern market and what

1651
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:18,119
do we have to do to to save it do you

1652
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:20,880
think it's fine as it is or do you think

1653
01:00:18,119 --> 01:00:21,880
we could better it from bringing in some

1654
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:24,119
older

1655
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:26,079
genetics well I think like our Market

1656
01:00:24,119 --> 01:00:28,358
here in is a great example of what you

1657
01:00:26,079 --> 01:00:30,079
saw in Colorado when Colorado went legal

1658
01:00:28,358 --> 01:00:33,880
is we're having this

1659
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:36,000
inflated uh uh THC and like choid uh

1660
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:38,838
profiles by like labs and so it's become

1661
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:41,119
this competition for for for customers

1662
01:00:38,838 --> 01:00:42,279
by Labs so clients are trying to take on

1663
01:00:41,119 --> 01:00:43,760
clients as much as they can or keep

1664
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:46,079
clients and so everything here is

1665
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:48,119
inflated so there's so many of us that

1666
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:51,000
don't even believe that there's really

1667
01:00:48,119 --> 01:00:52,640
30% that are kicking around or like

1668
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:55,199
obviously as many that you see I mean

1669
01:00:52,639 --> 01:00:57,118
you see coas here that are just they're

1670
01:00:55,199 --> 01:00:59,239
laughable you know and then it's just

1671
01:00:57,119 --> 01:01:00,720
like that's that's that's a start so we

1672
01:00:59,239 --> 01:01:02,719
have to get like good testing and

1673
01:01:00,719 --> 01:01:05,919
accurate testing in and then we can

1674
01:01:02,719 --> 01:01:07,919
really we can really get away from like

1675
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:09,798
really like numbers are so important

1676
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:11,440
don't ever get me wrong like I'm a data

1677
01:01:09,798 --> 01:01:13,358
guy I get it numbers are so important we

1678
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:14,960
need them for a lot of reasons but we

1679
01:01:13,358 --> 01:01:16,880
really want to know about effect and how

1680
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:18,720
that correlates to the numbers and so if

1681
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:20,400
we can get accurate numbers then we can

1682
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:23,639
start doing that we can see what people

1683
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:25,559
want to smoke and what is consumers like

1684
01:01:23,639 --> 01:01:26,679
what they what motiv to purchase stuff

1685
01:01:25,559 --> 01:01:28,960
because that's really the end game for

1686
01:01:26,679 --> 01:01:31,440
everybody right now right we have this

1687
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:33,199
whole Market guided toward 30 centers

1688
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:35,358
everyone's trying to buy 30 percenters

1689
01:01:33,199 --> 01:01:37,798
and I find that I agree if you get real

1690
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:41,000
testing down like you'll see that

1691
01:01:37,798 --> 01:01:43,599
cultivar that were testing at 20% rely

1692
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:46,679
breaking 20% 7even years ago are now

1693
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:49,039
well over like 28% or 30% so we get the

1694
01:01:46,679 --> 01:01:52,078
accurate testing down and I agree we can

1695
01:01:49,039 --> 01:01:54,520
bring in plants that are really 177% Tac

1696
01:01:52,079 --> 01:01:57,278
plants but have really interesting choid

1697
01:01:54,519 --> 01:01:58,960
profiles and then that at least we can

1698
01:01:57,278 --> 01:02:02,239
say like hey you're you're enjoying a

1699
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:04,159
plant that's 177% or even 133% but it's

1700
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:06,000
got this interesting camid profile and

1701
01:02:04,159 --> 01:02:08,679
that's why you're really enjoying it and

1702
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:10,639
now the way our Market Works in Canada

1703
01:02:08,679 --> 01:02:13,440
buyers won't even look like you you get

1704
01:02:10,639 --> 01:02:15,519
people requesting on like the buyers uh

1705
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:17,278
side of it and they're like we only want

1706
01:02:15,519 --> 01:02:19,119
we're looking for this this large amount

1707
01:02:17,278 --> 01:02:22,559
from so and so or this sort of thing but

1708
01:02:19,119 --> 01:02:25,480
it has to be has to be COA of of 28% or

1709
01:02:22,559 --> 01:02:27,000
above THC and so you can't even enter

1710
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:30,199
stuff that's special into the market

1711
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:32,440
right now that is maybe 17% like a true

1712
01:02:30,199 --> 01:02:35,480
177% and that sort of thing right now so

1713
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:37,599
that all has to kind of fall in line for

1714
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:40,119
us to really progress and do something

1715
01:02:37,599 --> 01:02:41,640
like that is is actually good for this

1716
01:02:40,119 --> 01:02:43,960
this kind of legalization thing that's

1717
01:02:41,639 --> 01:02:46,278
going on for everybody and so I would

1718
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:47,838
like to see we're kind of seeing it

1719
01:02:46,278 --> 01:02:50,480
because there's more requests I'm seeing

1720
01:02:47,838 --> 01:02:53,480
more requests for like a lot of the

1721
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:54,798
older stuff and so like it's a lot of

1722
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:56,760
the people are kind of kind of coming

1723
01:02:54,798 --> 01:02:58,960
back or they're realizing that there's a

1724
01:02:56,760 --> 01:03:01,240
market of connoisseurs that they can't

1725
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:03,920
bring to the dispensaries right now or

1726
01:03:01,239 --> 01:03:05,679
they can't bring to their brands that ex

1727
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:09,680
that want the experience of like hey if

1728
01:03:05,679 --> 01:03:11,919
I'm gonna buy you know like let's say um

1729
01:03:09,679 --> 01:03:13,879
San Fernando valoi kush like I want it

1730
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:15,200
to actually be the San Fernando valoi

1731
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:17,039
kush and I know that when I go buy it

1732
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:21,159
right now it's going to be some [ __ ]

1733
01:03:17,039 --> 01:03:22,960
who knows right hyp that they added yeah

1734
01:03:21,159 --> 01:03:27,759
yeah it's just so that sort of stuff and

1735
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:30,199
so not only is accurate lineage of like

1736
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:33,920
said cultivar important going to be

1737
01:03:30,199 --> 01:03:37,078
important but also real testing so like

1738
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:38,440
when those things kind of come in line

1739
01:03:37,079 --> 01:03:39,720
then we can really start entering

1740
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:42,159
interesting stuff that people will

1741
01:03:39,719 --> 01:03:45,399
consume because it won't be about 30%

1742
01:03:42,159 --> 01:03:47,920
THC or 9% T beans on a flower you're

1743
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:51,079
like get the [ __ ] out of here man like

1744
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:53,559
that barely exist if not doesn't so done

1745
01:03:51,079 --> 01:03:56,440
it a million times for sure but I mean

1746
01:03:53,559 --> 01:03:58,920
we're we're see this is resen yeah we're

1747
01:03:56,440 --> 01:04:01,760
seeing more people requesting and

1748
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:04,680
wanting old stuff which is which is

1749
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:06,880
promising but again it's as much as it's

1750
01:04:04,679 --> 01:04:08,759
promising those two things have to come

1751
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:10,400
into line for this to really be

1752
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:13,359
something that can happen because so far

1753
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:16,400
still it's like I want 30 plus percent

1754
01:04:13,358 --> 01:04:19,078
you see 40% flower which is like if you

1755
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:21,240
promote that you should just be like

1756
01:04:19,079 --> 01:04:24,920
silence that's just ridiculous

1757
01:04:21,239 --> 01:04:27,719
ridiculous promotion 40%

1758
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:29,440
this has been an amazing episode Paul I

1759
01:04:27,719 --> 01:04:31,358
want to thank you again so much before

1760
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:32,838
your time before we get going here

1761
01:04:31,358 --> 01:04:34,719
though I want to run through some of

1762
01:04:32,838 --> 01:04:35,440
these questions from the patreon members

1763
01:04:34,719 --> 01:04:38,759
for

1764
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:41,798
sure right first up we've got dank Pandy

1765
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:43,079
says do you know the genetics behind the

1766
01:04:41,798 --> 01:04:46,920
Lindsay

1767
01:04:43,079 --> 01:04:49,839
OG uh no well see ogs are funny in

1768
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:52,000
Canada what happens a lot in Canada is

1769
01:04:49,838 --> 01:04:53,880
an OG will come from somewhere and it's

1770
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:55,519
just [ __ ] renamed right so that's

1771
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:57,119
like what happen the ROI OG there's a

1772
01:04:55,519 --> 01:04:59,278
lot of ogs that like that's

1773
01:04:57,119 --> 01:05:01,160
unfortunately what happens everywhere

1774
01:04:59,278 --> 01:05:04,119
but so like stuff like stuff like

1775
01:05:01,159 --> 01:05:06,480
Lindsay OG comes from uh Lindsay Ontario

1776
01:05:04,119 --> 01:05:08,039
Liberty Farms so all credit has to go to

1777
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:09,880
Liberty farms uh you can check their

1778
01:05:08,039 --> 01:05:12,000
name you can just research uh Google

1779
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:14,039
Liberty Farms Canada and you'll see

1780
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:15,960
they're from Lindsay Ontario I better be

1781
01:05:14,039 --> 01:05:18,278
[ __ ] right with Ontario or I'm dead

1782
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:22,119
but I'm pretty sure it's on I'll be dead

1783
01:05:18,278 --> 01:05:24,599
sorry worst Canadian ever oh dead but uh

1784
01:05:22,119 --> 01:05:26,318
Liberty farms uh and they entered

1785
01:05:24,599 --> 01:05:28,519
competitions they've won but no one

1786
01:05:26,318 --> 01:05:31,679
seems to really know the lineage of of

1787
01:05:28,519 --> 01:05:34,358
what uh Lindsay is but she's really nice

1788
01:05:31,679 --> 01:05:36,798
she's really Kush dominant so not truly

1789
01:05:34,358 --> 01:05:41,038
truly heavily gassy but really a

1790
01:05:36,798 --> 01:05:43,038
beautiful like earthy type OG Kush so uh

1791
01:05:41,039 --> 01:05:44,839
special in her own right still keep her

1792
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:46,520
to this day one of the few that still

1793
01:05:44,838 --> 01:05:48,920
have her because she had a really high

1794
01:05:46,519 --> 01:05:51,079
peak of interest and then just [ __ ]

1795
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:53,798
died off with the like cookie cake

1796
01:05:51,079 --> 01:05:55,839
gelato cre I hit here like she's extinct

1797
01:05:53,798 --> 01:05:57,119
but like I still keep her I literally

1798
01:05:55,838 --> 01:05:57,960
have her in my flower room right now

1799
01:05:57,119 --> 01:06:03,760
that's just seated up with some

1800
01:05:57,960 --> 01:06:07,358
blueberry pollen so uh blueberry OG hell

1801
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:09,480
yeah that's awesome uh Big Bad John

1802
01:06:07,358 --> 01:06:12,119
wants to know what male selection do you

1803
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:14,400
have that holds pollen the

1804
01:06:12,119 --> 01:06:16,680
longest uh all I keep right now I used

1805
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:19,278
to have a a decent extensive library of

1806
01:06:16,679 --> 01:06:21,358
regular males now I only keep two males

1807
01:06:19,278 --> 01:06:23,318
and I keep one male is my favorite it's

1808
01:06:21,358 --> 01:06:26,318
my pinear Kush mail that comes from Tom

1809
01:06:23,318 --> 01:06:28,400
Hill Hayes and that line was found uh

1810
01:06:26,318 --> 01:06:30,679
through uh IC mag auction through

1811
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:33,440
verdant green did preservation work on

1812
01:06:30,679 --> 01:06:36,519
some Tom Hill Hayes or Tom Hill I ha Tom

1813
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:38,358
Hill punar Kush and so these were f3s

1814
01:06:36,519 --> 01:06:40,679
and they were like super rare at the

1815
01:06:38,358 --> 01:06:42,440
time and so that's the only male I keep

1816
01:06:40,679 --> 01:06:44,919
that regular male and I keep a really

1817
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:46,720
awesome I have a really special uh

1818
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:48,200
magnum opus male from efficient Auto

1819
01:06:46,719 --> 01:06:49,879
that I really enjoy and like working

1820
01:06:48,199 --> 01:06:53,000
with and those are the only two males I

1821
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:55,480
have now they're regulars and uh but I

1822
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:58,278
mean like my my goal I went through this

1823
01:06:55,480 --> 01:07:00,159
period where you do reading and research

1824
01:06:58,278 --> 01:07:02,239
and it's like you can't keep males at

1825
01:07:00,159 --> 01:07:03,358
drop pollen and veg you just can't do it

1826
01:07:02,239 --> 01:07:05,000
they're shitty they're going to produce

1827
01:07:03,358 --> 01:07:07,519
Herms they're garbage get rid of them

1828
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:10,199
don't keep them man they're a nuisance

1829
01:07:07,519 --> 01:07:12,920
to keep but I've like over time realized

1830
01:07:10,199 --> 01:07:15,078
that they don't all produce shitty like

1831
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:16,960
Offspring and some of them that like do

1832
01:07:15,079 --> 01:07:19,960
drop pollen sometimes drop pollen for

1833
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:21,760
just reasons that maybe aren't going to

1834
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:24,199
play out in future lines or future work

1835
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:26,160
that are negative so you just really

1836
01:07:24,199 --> 01:07:27,598
can't tell if it's bad or not until you

1837
01:07:26,159 --> 01:07:29,278
really see it in numbers and in

1838
01:07:27,599 --> 01:07:31,480
Offspring and in combinations but in in

1839
01:07:29,278 --> 01:07:33,199
decent numbers so that's really my

1840
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:35,798
advice on that like don't be scared to

1841
01:07:33,199 --> 01:07:37,558
keep them they're a pain to keep but uh

1842
01:07:35,798 --> 01:07:39,798
I have some males that just no matter

1843
01:07:37,559 --> 01:07:41,880
what you do in the past like the pine

1844
01:07:39,798 --> 01:07:44,318
tar Kush mail no matter what you do with

1845
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:46,760
that dude he can like sit and BGE he

1846
01:07:44,318 --> 01:07:48,519
never drops pollen but I find over the

1847
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:50,119
years of working with lots and lots and

1848
01:07:48,519 --> 01:07:52,719
lots of blueberry males for instance

1849
01:07:50,119 --> 01:07:54,318
like years of seeing blueberry males and

1850
01:07:52,719 --> 01:07:56,199
and holding on to them and and like kind

1851
01:07:54,318 --> 01:07:57,639
of keeping them for a while Dennis the

1852
01:07:56,199 --> 01:07:59,598
Menace was kind of unique in the way

1853
01:07:57,639 --> 01:08:02,038
that he would hold on to his pollen but

1854
01:07:59,599 --> 01:08:03,798
even at times of like certain stress

1855
01:08:02,039 --> 01:08:05,599
from either drought or needing some more

1856
01:08:03,798 --> 01:08:07,480
space in his root Zone he would

1857
01:08:05,599 --> 01:08:09,278
eventually throw some pollen and so

1858
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:10,599
those males like I said I have kept

1859
01:08:09,278 --> 01:08:12,920
around and I do have some males that

1860
01:08:10,599 --> 01:08:14,880
hold pollen like the pine pinear Kush

1861
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:16,119
male that guy holds pollen forever but I

1862
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:18,039
said at the end of the day don't worry

1863
01:08:16,119 --> 01:08:19,358
if some drop pollen and veg keep them or

1864
01:08:18,039 --> 01:08:21,439
work with them but just make sure you

1865
01:08:19,359 --> 01:08:22,838
know what they do or at best to your

1866
01:08:21,439 --> 01:08:25,838
ability know what they

1867
01:08:22,838 --> 01:08:25,838
do

1868
01:08:26,319 --> 01:08:29,798
I had lots of nails back in the day

1869
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:31,520
regular males like lots it was a

1870
01:08:29,798 --> 01:08:33,679
nuisance to to keep lots of those guys

1871
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:36,440
you just they're just real estate that's

1872
01:08:33,679 --> 01:08:37,838
why like go ahead go ahead no just

1873
01:08:36,439 --> 01:08:40,439
that's why feminize breeding now it's

1874
01:08:37,838 --> 01:08:44,000
just like it's not lazy but it's just so

1875
01:08:40,439 --> 01:08:45,838
nice to do now so so nice to do I've

1876
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:49,238
never done any of it I'm kind of scared

1877
01:08:45,838 --> 01:08:51,759
too honestly it's fun man but if I do I

1878
01:08:49,238 --> 01:08:53,358
will hit you up for some advice I just

1879
01:08:51,759 --> 01:08:55,359
thought it was hilarious that we had a

1880
01:08:53,359 --> 01:08:58,000
follow up patreon question here from

1881

you done any work with the UBC

1926
01:10:40,238 --> 01:10:44,678
chemo no but like obviously we you know

1927
01:10:43,158 --> 01:10:46,439
we were just having a conversation about

1928
01:10:44,679 --> 01:10:49,158
the other day uh me and a friend of mine

1929
01:10:46,439 --> 01:10:51,279
uh uh and like that if I can get my

1930
01:10:49,158 --> 01:10:52,439
hands on a couple of the older like I'm

1931
01:10:51,279 --> 01:10:53,880
I'm pretty happy with the library I

1932
01:10:52,439 --> 01:10:55,678
don't take much in anymore cuz some

1933
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:57,119
content but that is one that I would

1934
01:10:55,679 --> 01:10:59,079
always have an open door for but it's

1935
01:10:57,119 --> 01:11:00,479
hard to find every time I come across it

1936
01:10:59,079 --> 01:11:03,158
I've had it in Clone like I've had it

1937
01:11:00,479 --> 01:11:05,319
sent in cuting numerous times and one

1938
01:11:03,158 --> 01:11:08,079
time rooted no two times rooted but

1939
01:11:05,319 --> 01:11:11,279
every time I get it it's so [ __ ] like

1940
01:11:08,079 --> 01:11:13,399
it's so diseased and like so so so

1941
01:11:11,279 --> 01:11:15,880
filthy with with pests and and problems

1942
01:11:13,399 --> 01:11:17,198
that I just changed my mind about it and

1943
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:19,159
you know I've progressed over the years

1944
01:11:17,198 --> 01:11:21,238
where like out of necessity of just

1945
01:11:19,158 --> 01:11:24,079
preserving things I take things in that

1946
01:11:21,238 --> 01:11:26,399
are in the [ __ ] worst shape and

1947
01:11:24,079 --> 01:11:28,640
sometimes a year and a half to just like

1948
01:11:26,399 --> 01:11:30,319
kind of get to a state where they get

1949
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:32,760
reintroduced into the actual like

1950
01:11:30,319 --> 01:11:35,359
bedroom but yeah every time I I've ever

1951
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:38,000
had my my luck of getting it it's been

1952
01:11:35,359 --> 01:11:39,479
so it's been such a potential issue that

1953
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:41,000
I was like [ __ ] it it's not worth it

1954
01:11:39,479 --> 01:11:42,399
I'll find it again and it just never

1955
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:44,760
comes back in that state I want to take

1956
01:11:42,399 --> 01:11:46,599
it in at I would take it in now but it

1957
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:49,480
just hasn't come across my way in the

1958
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:51,719
Years special plant though for sure do

1959
01:11:49,479 --> 01:11:53,879
you know are you very familiar with Ramo

1960
01:11:51,719 --> 01:11:55,760
at all yeah so like everyone knows Remo

1961
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:57,440
he's a sweethart one of the best

1962
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:59,440
ambassadors to the Cannabis planting

1963
01:11:57,439 --> 01:12:02,479
Community he's a really really special

1964
01:11:59,439 --> 01:12:04,399
human being uh yeah I I I know of him

1965
01:12:02,479 --> 01:12:07,879
I've talked to him a few times and he

1966
01:12:04,399 --> 01:12:09,519
probably knows maybe of my of my brand

1967
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:11,359
but I definitely know him and like I've

1968
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:13,960
spoken to him before

1969
01:12:11,359 --> 01:12:16,839
yes and he sponsored some of my events

1970
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:18,840
which was nice that's awesome uh he was

1971
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:20,880
the last one that I had heard from that

1972
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:22,560
really really seemed to love that UBC

1973
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:24,359
chemo and I haven't heard about it

1974
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:25,440
really since that

1975
01:12:24,359 --> 01:12:27,079
that's cool that you have some

1976
01:12:25,439 --> 01:12:29,279
experience with it and you back it up

1977
01:12:27,079 --> 01:12:31,319
with that yeah it's it's definitely it's

1978
01:12:29,279 --> 01:12:34,119
held in BC and in play like it's there

1979
01:12:31,319 --> 01:12:37,559
it's held uh but like it's held very

1980
01:12:34,119 --> 01:12:39,079
tightly and uh you know it is on the

1981
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:40,440
it's like some of those plants that like

1982
01:12:39,079 --> 01:12:41,639
if it wasn't for a couple people holding

1983
01:12:40,439 --> 01:12:42,839
it it definitely would be extinct

1984
01:12:41,639 --> 01:12:44,719
because people have moved on

1985
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:47,480
unfortunately but it's truly a special

1986
01:12:44,719 --> 01:12:48,439
medicinal plant truly and if you're like

1987
01:12:47,479 --> 01:12:50,198
if you're able to get your hands on it

1988
01:12:48,439 --> 01:12:51,238
and you're lucky to consume it they

1989
01:12:50,198 --> 01:12:54,359
that's really

1990
01:12:51,238 --> 01:12:57,638
awesome I want to know where grapefruit

1991
01:12:54,359 --> 01:13:00,439
ranks on your top strengths really

1992
01:12:57,639 --> 01:13:02,920
special to like uh another one but like

1993
01:13:00,439 --> 01:13:05,079
I you know i' I've had it at times but

1994
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:06,399
don't have it now uh last time I was

1995
01:13:05,079 --> 01:13:09,119
trying to I was trying to get it into

1996
01:13:06,399 --> 01:13:11,279
the library was man maybe like four

1997
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:13,238
years ago uh and that was through

1998
01:13:11,279 --> 01:13:14,880
another uh really good Collective here

1999
01:13:13,238 --> 01:13:16,519
in in Canada that are a really

2000
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:18,359
well-known group of guys but for some

2001
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:20,159
reason it just didn't work out and I

2002
01:13:18,359 --> 01:13:21,238
know a couple people that hold it and

2003
01:13:20,158 --> 01:13:23,679
like I said it's just one of those

2004
01:13:21,238 --> 01:13:26,519
plants like I have a a federation in a

2005
01:13:23,679 --> 01:13:28,480
really old Federation Mado uh cut that's

2006
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:30,800
essentially grapefruit you know because

2007
01:13:28,479 --> 01:13:33,039
it's essentially like a breeder Steve

2008
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:34,679
line of grapefruit essentially and so

2009
01:13:33,039 --> 01:13:36,399
it's uh it's really nice and and that

2010
01:13:34,679 --> 01:13:37,840
does the grapefruit job for me and I

2011
01:13:36,399 --> 01:13:39,479
I've had a test that I know what a test

2012
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:41,760
at I've worked with it and I really like

2013
01:13:39,479 --> 01:13:43,519
it and that's a special cut to me that's

2014
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:47,560
similar enough to have to not have to go

2015
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:49,280
chase down the the grapefruit cut the SP

2016
01:13:47,560 --> 01:13:52,039
you're talking about the sweet pink

2017
01:13:49,279 --> 01:13:54,000
grapefruit yeah yeah have you ever had

2018
01:13:52,039 --> 01:13:56,840
any other styles of grapefruit

2019
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:59,679
great well just like I said the makato

2020
01:13:56,840 --> 01:14:02,560
like the makado is is a special uh so

2021
01:13:59,679 --> 01:14:05,000
Federation Jason uh who is next

2022
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:08,320
Generation seeds now he was Federation

2023
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:10,520
seeds before uh partner and they had a

2024
01:14:08,319 --> 01:14:12,880
line that was

2025
01:14:10,520 --> 01:14:14,679
essentially the the the sweet pink was

2026
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:16,639
used in that line and a lot of the

2027
01:14:14,679 --> 01:14:19,319
offscreen that pumped out were very

2028
01:14:16,639 --> 01:14:21,719
great prominant and so we have a really

2029
01:14:19,319 --> 01:14:24,079
old school like Federation was a staple

2030
01:14:21,719 --> 01:14:27,158
in Canada and like from the old Emy

2031
01:14:24,079 --> 01:14:29,439
magazines like just a really wicked

2032
01:14:27,158 --> 01:14:31,559
breeding crew right and Jason's a sweet

2033
01:14:29,439 --> 01:14:34,799
like Jason's amazing with next Jen and

2034
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:36,560
yeah he had the the the cutting and used

2035
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:39,320
The Cutting and and in that subsequent

2036
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:40,760
line really really awesome grapefruit

2037
01:14:39,319 --> 01:14:43,359
fenos kicked out and we have this

2038
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:46,320
amazing cut that was hunted by a really

2039
01:14:43,359 --> 01:14:47,759
awesome guy out of the Yukon and he you

2040
01:14:46,319 --> 01:14:49,599
know he's one of those guys we were able

2041
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:51,800
to return this cut to it's his favorite

2042
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:54,639
cut but it's a great kind of uh really

2043
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:56,880
dominant uh a great

2044
01:14:54,639 --> 01:15:00,840
cut that's awesome

2045
01:14:56,880 --> 01:15:02,679
so I asked about that because I had a

2046
01:15:00,840 --> 01:15:05,600
friend that did a collab with another

2047
01:15:02,679 --> 01:15:07,480
breeder one used the sweet pink one used

2048
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:10,280
another line of grapefruit that they had

2049
01:15:07,479 --> 01:15:13,039
to kind of bring diversity back to the

2050
01:15:10,279 --> 01:15:15,960
line um instead of bring it was very

2051
01:15:13,039 --> 01:15:18,238
very heavy on the sweet pink at the time

2052
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:21,079
um and I grew out some of the progyny

2053
01:15:18,238 --> 01:15:22,959
from that and the sweet pink is [ __ ]

2054
01:15:21,079 --> 01:15:25,559
amazing I remember growing that back in

2055
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:27,560
the Greenhouse days it threw down pounds

2056
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:30,639
you didn't really have to do too much of

2057
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:32,520
it except for like feed it heavy um you

2058
01:15:30,639 --> 01:15:34,159
didn't really have to do much to it it

2059
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:36,719
kind of grew itself really it was

2060
01:15:34,158 --> 01:15:40,238
beautiful you know and everybody knows

2061
01:15:36,719 --> 01:15:43,399
the sweet pink taste but we had one that

2062
01:15:40,238 --> 01:15:45,319
was oh God it was a [ __ ] of a plant it

2063
01:15:43,399 --> 01:15:47,879
was a [ __ ] of a plant it had like 2in

2064
01:15:45,319 --> 01:15:50,198
inner nodes on it and it would just

2065
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:52,400
throw off really really small hard

2066
01:15:50,198 --> 01:15:54,399
budlets around it everything about it

2067
01:15:52,399 --> 01:15:56,960
looked like the Great gra fruit except

2068
01:15:54,399 --> 01:15:59,679
if you stretched out those interner noes

2069
01:15:56,960 --> 01:16:01,359
and something about that one I I got rid

2070
01:15:59,679 --> 01:16:04,000
of it the first time that I found it

2071
01:16:01,359 --> 01:16:05,439
thank God I went back um but I lost the

2072
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:07,800
first time because I just said this is a

2073
01:16:05,439 --> 01:16:10,799
straggly plant nobody wants to grow this

2074
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:12,320
you know and right I did the grower

2075
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:15,279
thing and afterwards found out that it

2076
01:16:12,319 --> 01:16:18,279
was amazing and right regretted every

2077
01:16:15,279 --> 01:16:20,399
second of it but it was exactly like the

2078
01:16:18,279 --> 01:16:22,039
sweet pink but it had a bit more sour

2079
01:16:20,399 --> 01:16:24,238
taste to it have you ever come across

2080
01:16:22,039 --> 01:16:26,439
anything like that

2081
01:16:24,238 --> 01:16:28,599
like I always say like a lot of people

2082
01:16:26,439 --> 01:16:30,879
toss runts and I always find that like

2083
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:33,320
the runty plants sometimes are the ones

2084
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:35,760
that you want to put some Focus onto and

2085
01:16:33,319 --> 01:16:37,840
so I have found in my in my days like a

2086
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:39,199
lot of times you run something that is

2087
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:41,440
either like runty or a little bit

2088
01:16:39,198 --> 01:16:43,039
finicky in round one keep your eye on it

2089
01:16:41,439 --> 01:16:44,319
because sometimes you know make sure you

2090
01:16:43,039 --> 01:16:45,960
get a clone of that one for sure

2091
01:16:44,319 --> 01:16:47,759
specifically like sometimes you're so

2092
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:49,960
busy with the cloning process and

2093
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:51,880
keeping things for subsequent next round

2094
01:16:49,960 --> 01:16:53,399
and Keepers that you like ah it's the

2095
01:16:51,880 --> 01:16:55,319
[ __ ] run I won't worry too much voted

2096
01:16:53,399 --> 01:16:56,879
if it lives or dies but don't man make

2097
01:16:55,319 --> 01:16:59,799
sure that runt is cloned and make sure

2098
01:16:56,880 --> 01:17:01,359
that clun that uh that runt will will

2099
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:03,079
will survive because sometimes those

2100
01:17:01,359 --> 01:17:04,439
runs are special and so yeah I've

2101
01:17:03,079 --> 01:17:05,960
experienced times where runs really

2102
01:17:04,439 --> 01:17:08,119
really shine and you're like thank God I

2103
01:17:05,960 --> 01:17:10,239
got a clone of it but grapefruit like I

2104
01:17:08,119 --> 01:17:11,599
said only thing I really really enjoy

2105
01:17:10,238 --> 01:17:13,678
grapefruit wise in my garden because

2106
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:16,039
it's sweet and I like sweet but not a

2107
01:17:13,679 --> 01:17:17,560
big fan of it is federations maccato cut

2108
01:17:16,039 --> 01:17:20,079
that I have and it's only because of

2109
01:17:17,560 --> 01:17:21,880
nostalgia I love Federation it's like

2110
01:17:20,079 --> 01:17:24,319
one of my favorite like when I think of

2111
01:17:21,880 --> 01:17:28,400
seeds I think of fed ation seeds like

2112
01:17:24,319 --> 01:17:30,799
Canadian you know emry magazine just

2113
01:17:28,399 --> 01:17:32,399
running home to look at the Seed Catalog

2114
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:34,560
and then putting your order in and they

2115
01:17:32,399 --> 01:17:36,879
were reasonably priced and everything

2116
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:39,080
that that they put out in the day like

2117
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:41,159
Jason's uh if you want really good seeds

2118
01:17:39,079 --> 01:17:43,600
Jason from Next Generation you can find

2119
01:17:41,158 --> 01:17:45,559
him he's a really really really special

2120
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:47,600
uh Canadian breeder he puts out a lot of

2121
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:49,800
stuff but yeah that that stuff is really

2122
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:51,920
really special if somebody wanted to put

2123
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:53,520
an order of seeds in with you how would

2124
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:56,158
they find you

2125
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:57,600
you just really like I said like I do so

2126
01:17:56,158 --> 01:17:58,960
much I have so much other stuff going on

2127
01:17:57,600 --> 01:18:00,199
that I just I don't can't be bothered

2128
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:02,560
with websites and stuff and I had a

2129
01:18:00,198 --> 01:18:04,399
couple Distributors and stuff but the

2130
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:08,120
best place to really catch me is like

2131
01:18:04,399 --> 01:18:10,039
just literally on um on like Instagram

2132
01:18:08,119 --> 01:18:11,639
and like I know it's it's so stupid but

2133
01:18:10,039 --> 01:18:14,079
it's really the best place to catch me

2134
01:18:11,639 --> 01:18:15,880
and unfortunately for a long time yeah

2135
01:18:14,079 --> 01:18:19,559
unfortunately like you have to be

2136
01:18:15,880 --> 01:18:21,079
there's one fake account so just like

2137
01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:22,760
you have to make sure you check their

2138
01:18:21,079 --> 01:18:23,479
page and my page who you're talking to

2139
01:18:22,760 --> 01:18:25,280
cuz

2140
01:18:23,479 --> 01:18:26,919
my page has got lots of cannabis

2141
01:18:25,279 --> 01:18:29,039
pictures on it and theirs is very much

2142
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:30,480
not so and then just make sure you know

2143
01:18:29,039 --> 01:18:31,840
you're talking to I can confirm it just

2144
01:18:30,479 --> 01:18:34,359

2146
01:18:34,359 --> 01:18:38,799
the certain way I talk it's a little bit

2147
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:40,840
much sometimes that's how I am you'll

2148
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:43,360
get a VI you'll get a vibe that it's me

2149
01:18:40,840 --> 01:18:45,440

2152
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:50,639
just do that but I'm unfortunately I'm

2153
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:52,679
sorry that's the way to get a hold of me

2154
01:18:50,639 --> 01:18:54,239
you have to do that way uh maybe one day

2155
01:18:52,679 --> 01:18:56,239

01:19:04,119 --> 01:19:08,559
podcasts in a while man I got to say

around to the very end here I want you

2166
01:19:16,679 --> 01:19:20,359

20 we're going to give away two packs

2168
01:19:20,359 --> 01:19:25,479
here the Alaskan [ __ ] the Topanga

2169
01:19:22,920 --> 01:19:27,920
Canyon cross and the oldtime one Haze

2170
01:19:25,479 --> 01:19:31,119
with the Winnie the blue I want to know

2171
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:33,679
about your Oldtimer one Haze that's the

2172
01:19:31,119 --> 01:19:36,039
cut I'm I'm happy you asked because this

2173
01:19:33,679 --> 01:19:38,158
goes back to uh a really special guy

2174
01:19:36,039 --> 01:19:39,920
that I also have in my world his name's

2175
01:19:38,158 --> 01:19:44,519
uh I'll just won't shut him hope full

2176
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:46,158
but is uh James T really solid guy um I

2177
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:47,600
was lucky enough to have some old uh

2178
01:19:46,158 --> 01:19:49,039
seeds Oldtimer one Haze and I was going

2179
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:51,719
to do a run and he was like hey dude

2180
01:19:49,039 --> 01:19:53,639
let's make it a run I think I had 12 or

2181
01:19:51,719 --> 01:19:56,520
10 and he was like he end up giving me

2182
01:19:53,639 --> 01:19:59,639
like 30 so I ran a a hunt of 40 Oldtimer

2183
01:19:56,520 --> 01:20:01,080
one Haze in my in my situation uh and I

2184
01:19:59,639 --> 01:20:02,719
have some experience running with some

2185
01:20:01,079 --> 01:20:05,600
of sativas so it's not the end of the

2186
01:20:02,719 --> 01:20:07,880
world but ran a large feno hunt narrowed

2187
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:10,960
down to three we had some lab tests on

2188
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:13,319
three ended up doing uh funny enough I

2189
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:15,600
never based on THC but there was such a

2190
01:20:13,319 --> 01:20:17,799
large hunt and and so much work involved

2191
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:19,920
that I had these three fenos I went with

2192
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:22,159
the highest THC Plano that all that

2193
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:25,000
oldtime one Haze and I think it hit just

2194
01:20:22,158 --> 01:20:27,638
around 133% just a little bit uh below

2195
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:29,079
133% so 12 something so I took that one

2196
01:20:27,639 --> 01:20:30,920
had beautiful structure too was one of

2197
01:20:29,079 --> 01:20:32,800
the best ones out of the whole room it

2198
01:20:30,920 --> 01:20:35,399
was more suitable for the indoor kind of

2199
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:36,520
space that I grow in uh not not like you

2200
01:20:35,399 --> 01:20:38,638
know where they should be growing Under

2201
01:20:36,520 --> 01:20:40,120
full sun but that is a pheno that came

2202
01:20:38,639 --> 01:20:43,159
out that large hunt so that goes to

2203
01:20:40,119 --> 01:20:44,760
James T took that female and then we

2204
01:20:43,158 --> 01:20:48,000
revers winie the blue and so you get

2205
01:20:44,760 --> 01:20:50,440
this really beautiful line of like

2206
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:52,359
really extreme expression so Winnie's a

2207
01:20:50,439 --> 01:20:53,839
a real true seven to eight week flower

2208
01:20:52,359 --> 01:20:56,519
range can go nine weeks but she can be

2209
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:58,440
pulled 7 and 1 half 8 weeks so you have

2210
01:20:56,520 --> 01:21:00,560
this really extreme line to hunt through

2211
01:20:58,439 --> 01:21:03,519
where you get this really beautiful Haze

2212
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:04,760
Expressions which are are are quite

2213
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:06,159
quite beautiful with a lot of the

2214
01:21:04,760 --> 01:21:07,079
shorter flowering when the blue traits

2215
01:21:06,158 --> 01:21:09,839
so you get a lot of that kind of like

2216
01:21:07,079 --> 01:21:12,198
blueberry Haze so it's a really fun fun

2217
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:16,520
line to hunt through and yes it's it's

2218
01:21:12,198 --> 01:21:18,198
for sure legitimate Oldtimer one Haze so

2219
01:21:16,520 --> 01:21:21,480
let's say flowering time how much did it

2220
01:21:18,198 --> 01:21:23,960
bring it down well these hazes went deep

2221
01:21:21,479 --> 01:21:25,678
like we were up to uh in in indoor that

2222
01:21:23,960 --> 01:21:27,119
that that hunt went deep and then we did

2223
01:21:25,679 --> 01:21:29,279
another run for seeds like we did our

2224
01:21:27,119 --> 01:21:30,559
first run for just our our hunt made our

2225
01:21:29,279 --> 01:21:33,039
selections that we narrowed down to

2226
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:34,920
three or we narrowed down to six but we

2227
01:21:33,039 --> 01:21:37,479
ended up keeping three for future runs

2228
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:39,440
and for future work um but yeah those

2229
01:21:37,479 --> 01:21:42,279
went I think the longest went just short

2230
01:21:39,439 --> 01:21:45,119
of like 19 weeks 18 weeks like these

2231
01:21:42,279 --> 01:21:48,079
some of these like true true like like

2232
01:21:45,119 --> 01:21:50,439
wild Haze plants they were so unruly and

2233
01:21:48,079 --> 01:21:52,198
big uh and that was with like all the

2234
01:21:50,439 --> 01:21:53,599
training that I've been able to acquire

2235
01:21:52,198 --> 01:21:55,799
from people people over the years on how

2236
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:56,960
to do it right indoor and doing no

2237
01:21:55,800 --> 01:21:58,560
justice because we all know this should

2238
01:21:56,960 --> 01:22:00,600
be grown outdoors in full sun and done

2239
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:03,039
well but this is the best I can do and

2240
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:04,280
so yeah they went up really high

2241
01:22:03,039 --> 01:22:05,600
flowering time win's are shorter

2242
01:22:04,279 --> 01:22:08,198
flowering time so you'll get things that

2243
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:10,159
are around most will be in that like 13

2244
01:22:08,198 --> 01:22:12,079
14 week because Winnie will really

2245
01:22:10,158 --> 01:22:14,119
shorten flower time in a r Crossing

2246
01:22:12,079 --> 01:22:15,439
really will take over Flower time and

2247
01:22:14,119 --> 01:22:17,000
then you'll get some outliers obviously

2248
01:22:15,439 --> 01:22:18,559
that are going to be shorter but most of

2249
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:20,600
the outl will be higher flowering times

2250
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:23,239
that will maybe go above that timeline

2251
01:22:20,600 --> 01:22:24,880
but most will be in that range

2252
01:22:23,238 --> 01:22:27,519
that's not too uncontrollable do you

2253
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:29,880
have any tips for people that want to

2254
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:32,320
grow these hazes indoor how to best

2255
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:34,560
control them for sure and these are all

2256
01:22:32,319 --> 01:22:36,399
like I said just things that have been

2257
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:38,320
passed on to me this is nothing I can

2258
01:22:36,399 --> 01:22:40,920
take credit for but for sure lots of

2259
01:22:38,319 --> 01:22:42,198
shout outs to rev Charles uh reeferman

2260
01:22:40,920 --> 01:22:44,560
teaching all this sort of knowledge

2261
01:22:42,198 --> 01:22:48,279
passing on for free but yeah man my TR

2262
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:50,159
my trick is first and foremost we always

2263
01:22:48,279 --> 01:22:52,679
have to agree that they should always be

2264
01:22:50,158 --> 01:22:54,679
done properly in full sun and like

2265
01:22:52,679 --> 01:22:56,119
outdoor proper Sun so this is just

2266
01:22:54,679 --> 01:22:58,319
you're doing the best you can with your

2267
01:22:56,119 --> 01:23:00,279
environment and so these really unruly

2268
01:22:58,319 --> 01:23:03,158
hazes or some of the African varieties

2269
01:23:00,279 --> 01:23:05,439
that go 22 21 weeks that it's just Thai

2270
01:23:03,158 --> 01:23:07,238
varieties that are just mind-blowingly

2271
01:23:05,439 --> 01:23:09,319
long flowering first thing you want to

2272
01:23:07,238 --> 01:23:10,879
do is you want to deal with your uh your

2273
01:23:09,319 --> 01:23:12,759
lighting so you want to make sure that

2274
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:14,440
you're going into a lighting a lighting

2275
01:23:12,760 --> 01:23:17,039
kind of environment that is going to be

2276
01:23:14,439 --> 01:23:18,839
shorter than your 12 and 12 so sometimes

2277
01:23:17,039 --> 01:23:22,560
you want to start at maybe you know you

2278
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:24,199
want to do 13 on 11 off for like a

2279
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:25,760
period of time and then slowly reduce as

2280
01:23:24,198 --> 01:23:27,119
we get closer to ripeness into flower

2281
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:29,119
time to ensure you get some sort of

2282
01:23:27,119 --> 01:23:32,399
ripeness so you don't continually get

2283
01:23:29,119 --> 01:23:36,319
reving ringing down to what I mean you

2284
01:23:32,399 --> 01:23:38,599
can go as low as 10 on like 10 on yeah

2285
01:23:36,319 --> 01:23:41,439
and that will help that will help

2286
01:23:38,600 --> 01:23:43,159
prevent this massive con like 12 and 12

2287
01:23:41,439 --> 01:23:45,479
you're just going to get flowering to a

2288
01:23:43,158 --> 01:23:48,119
point and then it's just gonna Reed re

2289
01:23:45,479 --> 01:23:49,559
rege so it's a real like bummer right if

2290
01:23:48,119 --> 01:23:51,840
you're making seeds it's not the end of

2291
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:52,880
the world but it's still not not ideal

2292
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:54,600
and so that's one one thing you want to

2293
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:55,840
do before you even start then you want

2294
01:23:54,600 --> 01:23:57,079
to realize you want to look at what

2295
01:23:55,840 --> 01:23:58,159
these things are going to flower for if

2296
01:23:57,079 --> 01:24:00,679
it's some of those varieties that are

2297
01:23:58,158 --> 01:24:02,079
going 20 weeks be prepared dude like

2298
01:24:00,679 --> 01:24:04,039
you're going to take like six months out

2299
01:24:02,079 --> 01:24:07,079
of your life for these plants and so

2300
01:24:04,039 --> 01:24:09,800
plan that too so make sure that this is

2301
01:24:07,079 --> 01:24:13,600
what we do too so get them uh started in

2302
01:24:09,800 --> 01:24:15,760
seeds get them uh transplanted up you

2303
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:17,440
know as you normally would and then

2304
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:18,880
start getting your topping so you can

2305
01:24:17,439 --> 01:24:20,479
get some clones off of them but because

2306
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:22,199
they're such long flowering plants you

2307
01:24:20,479 --> 01:24:24,799
can kind of cheat and this is what I

2308
01:24:22,198 --> 01:24:27,039
like doing so just get them going get

2309
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:28,800
them in a good pot upsize upsize upsize

2310
01:24:27,039 --> 01:24:31,079
till they're a foot tall no more than a

2311
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:32,560
foot tall even 10 inches tall and then

2312
01:24:31,079 --> 01:24:34,679
just [ __ ] put them in your flower

2313
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:36,960
room and start flowering at that stage

2314
01:24:34,679 --> 01:24:38,960
and because they flower so long they

2315
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:40,560
don't really trip uh and you don't

2316
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:44,039
really see flower range trates until

2317
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:45,360
like sometimes 10 weeks 11 12 13 weeks

2318
01:24:44,039 --> 01:24:47,079
right so you're just getting these

2319
01:24:45,359 --> 01:24:48,880
plants that continually are just getting

2320
01:24:47,079 --> 01:24:50,719
bigger and bigger and bigger so you you

2321
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:52,800
can theoretically save time in planning

2322
01:24:50,719 --> 01:24:55,319
and just take all your clones off your

2323
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:56,960
mothers and do all your your like

2324
01:24:55,319 --> 01:24:58,319
labeling and all that for your your

2325
01:24:56,960 --> 01:25:00,158
future Keepers and what you're going to

2326
01:24:58,319 --> 01:25:01,519
keep in round two so that's a trick to

2327
01:25:00,158 --> 01:25:02,960
do that and that way you can kind of

2328
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:05,040
maintain and hack them down a little bit

2329
01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:07,800
but it's a process so flip them really

2330
01:25:05,039 --> 01:25:09,439
early change a light cycle get them in

2331
01:25:07,800 --> 01:25:11,800
really good pots so that they don't

2332
01:25:09,439 --> 01:25:14,399
really need a a lot of attention like

2333
01:25:11,800 --> 01:25:15,960
rev said at best sativas are the Wolves

2334
01:25:14,399 --> 01:25:17,920
of the Cannabis World they don't really

2335
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:20,719
need a lot of human intervention hybrids

2336
01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:23,399
and indas are dogs they kind of need us

2337
01:25:20,719 --> 01:25:25,639
and so you know this Tiba when we grow

2338
01:25:23,399 --> 01:25:27,638
it I put it in really big pots and I let

2339
01:25:25,639 --> 01:25:28,960
them kind of just do their thing there

2340
01:25:27,639 --> 01:25:30,920
and because they're flowering for so

2341
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:32,639
long lots of basement layering of

2342
01:25:30,920 --> 01:25:35,079
amendments and then top trusting

2343
01:25:32,639 --> 01:25:36,279
throughout the whole program but really

2344
01:25:35,079 --> 01:25:37,279
that's all they're going to require

2345
01:25:36,279 --> 01:25:39,840
right because they're going to go so

2346
01:25:37,279 --> 01:25:42,198
deep and that to me with those methods

2347
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:44,039
keeps them short keeps them manageable

2348
01:25:42,198 --> 01:25:46,039
you can still clone them uh and save

2349
01:25:44,039 --> 01:25:47,319
yourself some time in planning and it's

2350
01:25:46,039 --> 01:25:50,079
just with the lighting schedule they

2351
01:25:47,319 --> 01:25:52,279
finish indoors and so it's not not

2352
01:25:50,079 --> 01:25:53,639
something that most people can't do but

2353
01:25:52,279 --> 01:25:54,960
but it will take some some some

2354
01:25:53,639 --> 01:25:57,560
experience of doing that and then some

2355
01:25:54,960 --> 01:26:00,560
training basic training that's what I do

2356
01:25:57,560 --> 01:26:02,400
and that helps a lot I I love that

2357
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:03,800
answer and I learned a couple things

2358
01:26:02,399 --> 01:26:06,319
right there that I'm think I might

2359
01:26:03,800 --> 01:26:08,760
incorporate with uh some of the Ty runs

2360
01:26:06,319 --> 01:26:11,039
too that was very good advice thank you

2361
01:26:08,760 --> 01:26:12,880
so much for that Paul and uh thank you

2362
