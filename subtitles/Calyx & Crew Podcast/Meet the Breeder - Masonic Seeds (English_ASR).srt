just let me know uh but we're going to

62
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:54,000
get into some controversial [ __ ] but

63
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:57,079
first off I really want to get to know

64
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,680
who you are you know as a person so why

65
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:01,239
don't we just start off with the easy

66
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,519
[ __ ] like how did you get into cannabis

67
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:07,280
what was your first

68
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:11,200
experience uh smoking weed um like like

69
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:14,719
in ninth grade smoking weed I I enjoyed

70
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:18,000
it when I smoked it and uh just kept

71
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:20,519
smoking every day never stopped and

72
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,039
then kind of like played with a seed

73
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:24,519
here and there from a bag seed throw it

74
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:28,598
in some dirt see what happens all this

75
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:31,319
like at age 15 16 and then finally when

76
00:03:28,598 --> 00:03:34,438
I turned like 18

77
00:03:31,318 --> 00:03:37,000
uh I decided I wanted to grow some pot

78
00:03:34,438 --> 00:03:41,359
to try to emulate the weed that I was

79
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:44,239
smoking so uh I ended up growing pot

80
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:46,840
because uh I had a habit that I had to

81
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,280
sustain fair enough fair enough you

82
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:51,319
remember what some of those first types

83
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:54,438
that you ever smoked on were so I

84
00:03:51,318 --> 00:03:56,679
started a smoking weed like I grew up on

85
00:03:54,438 --> 00:03:59,400
a in South Central on a on a street

86
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:01,959
called Avalon well like the it's 111th

87
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:05,760
in Avon it's like kind of ghetto there

88
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:08,120
you know and uh the the weed we grew up

89
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:10,919
on was stress that's what they called it

90
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:14,519
it was brick weed stress is brick weed

91
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:16,279
usually weed sends him from Mexico super

92
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:18,840
compacted because they had to like hide

93
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:21,078
it and in you know during Transportation

94
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:23,679
whatever which way and this weed would

95
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:26,319
be full of seeds so you would get your

96
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,560
$5 nickel bag and you would break it all

97
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:30,079
down and we would smoke it in blunts cuz

98
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,199
it didn't taste that good in points and

99
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:34,399
then blunts lasted longer that was our

100
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:37,280
our rhetoric so we started with stress

101
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:40,918
and blunts up up upgraded to like

102
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:43,799
chronic Kush OG and then start hitting

103
00:04:40,918 --> 00:04:45,359
the medical dispensaries uh like we'll

104
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,199
we'll have a big homie go like hey you

105
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,960
know or a big homie would be have his

106
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:53,240
card and we'd always go cop off of him

107
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:55,638
ironically today when I was at the post

108
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:58,199
office uh I ran into like one of my

109
00:04:55,639 --> 00:05:00,439
first plugs from when I was like a kid

110
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:01,680
and and and I I recognized his his wife

111
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:03,879
because she used to sell the weed for

112
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,680
him too and I'm like that's her and I

113
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:07,719
look up and he's there too and I'm like

114
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,560
hey what's up create he's all he looked

115
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:11,400
at me like CU you know we're in the

116
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:13,959
we're the we're in the we're in the post

117
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:15,560
office in Watts like ghetto as [ __ ] and

118
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:17,239
he's just like like on his guard I'm

119
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:19,639
like you don't remember me like I used

120
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:21,918
to buy weed off of you almost every day

121
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:23,160
and he's just like and then it clicked

122
00:05:21,918 --> 00:05:25,120
and then he just had this big [ __ ]

123
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:27,720
eating grin on his face and I'm like

124
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,918
yeah dude I'm like it all paid off

125
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,919
because that's that's all do now doing

126
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:33,159
now

127
00:05:30,918 --> 00:05:35,478
[ __ ] and then I just left and

128
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:38,319
and that happened what like three hours

129
00:05:35,478 --> 00:05:41,079
ago maybe so that's how I grew I grew up

130
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:43,439
buying weed on the streets of South

131
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:45,599
Central Los Angeles and upgraded my way

132
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:47,759
to the dispensary and then it all just

133
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:52,280
kind of unraveled from there from ghetto

134
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:54,639
to ghetto uh respect for sure uh we had

135
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:56,318
the exact same thing we called it MCH up

136
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,519
here instead of stress but it was the

137
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:01,560
same [ __ ] [ __ ] bag ass [ __ ] from

it in the dirt water just just for

165
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:11,799
funsies always grew like a seed on the

166
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:14,598
side but started growing for like cash

167
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:17,639
crop put some pots in the backyard like

168
00:07:14,598 --> 00:07:20,439
uh somewhere around 18 years old you

169
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:22,759
know okay right after uh High School

170
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:24,399
when my pops had bought me a pound of

171
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:28,160
Sour Diesel because I graduated high

172
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:33,279
school as a like a congratulations gift

173
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:35,240
and uh I didn't necessarily re up I just

174
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:37,519
kind of smoked most of it and bought

175
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:39,360
dumb [ __ ] and I was just a kid you know

176
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:42,478
and and when it was all gone I'm just

177
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:45,720
like what am I gonna do you know and my

178
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:49,038
dad's like talk to Ry Ray Ray knows

179
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:53,479
about growing so he ended up

180
00:07:49,038 --> 00:07:56,199
Ry convinced my dad to go buy like 10 15

181
00:07:53,478 --> 00:07:57,680
gallon drums and like a bunch of dirt

182
00:07:56,199 --> 00:07:59,759
and just throw the Clones in there so

183
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,240
rats ended up chewing that and and even

184
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,439
then I wasn't like I was just like ah

185
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,280
whatever I just want to smoke weed I

186
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:05,800
don't really want to grow or like what

187
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:07,079
is that I don't get it yet you know it

188
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,960
wasn't it wasn't a concept that I

189
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:12,158
understood yet and then finally the fire

190
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:13,878
was getting hotter under my ass where

191
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:15,959
the the sour diesel pound started to

192
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:17,080
deplete more and more and you know

193
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:18,598
another pound wasn't going to come

194
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:21,000
around that was a one-time gift you were

195
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:23,560
supposed to figure it out you know and

196
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,319
uh I'm just like I got to grow weed just

197
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:27,280
like my dad was about to grow weed how

198
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:29,479
we were going to but the rats ate it so

199
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:31,839
I little by little just started buying

200
00:08:29,478 --> 00:08:34,038
dirt putting bag seeds in the ground any

201
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:35,679
random clone that you know me or any of

202
00:08:34,038 --> 00:08:37,278
my family members would get at a clone

203
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:39,799
from a firsttime patient deal or

204
00:08:37,278 --> 00:08:41,918
whatever whatever uh bring it over here

205
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:44,158
let's grow it you know and next you know

206
00:08:41,918 --> 00:08:46,199
we started with six plants and then 12

207
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:48,600
and then 24 and then [ __ ] let's fill

208
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:50,759
up all the space you know is that is

209
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:53,320
that how it goes now it's just whatever

210
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:57,639
we can pack in there that's kind of how

211
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:59,440
I uh do my grow and now it's it's even

212
00:08:57,639 --> 00:09:02,319
hard to pack in the space now cuz it's

213
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,839
just I move so so much it's just like

214
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,519
[ __ ] that's already done we got to fill

215
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:08,440
it up again [ __ ] like it's just it's

216
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:10,879
it's it's becoming a whole ass job and

217
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:13,200
it's cool like I'm not bitching but yeah

218
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:16,120
like filling the gaps filling the gaps

219
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:18,120
like like I'm not worried about you know

220
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:20,039
we're doing it how it's always been done

221
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:22,278
and I'm just like just filling the gaps

222
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:25,399
you know whatever happens

223
00:09:22,278 --> 00:09:28,480
happens okay so leading from growing

224
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:30,120
into breeding growing kind of came out

225
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,560
in necessity

226
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:35,039
uh how did you make that transition from

227
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:38,359
growing to breeding like how how long

228
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:41,439
was it and what was a why so I've been

229
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:44,039
growing I graduated high school in

230
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:46,360
2010 probably started found out what

231
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:49,159
making seeds was in like

232
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:52,759
2016 so I I was growing for like six

233
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:55,159
years cash crop blasting it all selling

234
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:56,759
it to the dispensary smoking it just on

235
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:58,159
top of the world just smoking my own

236
00:09:56,759 --> 00:09:59,679
[ __ ] Backyard Boogie not worried

237
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:02,759
about nobody's [ __ ]

238
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:04,879
and uh eventually I find Instagram and

239
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:07,720
and I was never on forms I didn't know

240
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:10,120
what a form was I did kind of find this

241
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:11,759

00:13:22,839 --> 00:13:28,320
what that sold pretty

325
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:29,639
well I I uh I didn't have to use that

326
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,120
much space

327
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:33,240
I didn't have to dry all this weed I

328
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,399
didn't have to package it all that felt

329
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,519
good people respect the vision I didn't

330
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:38,440
understand that I was just kind of just

331
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:40,759
rolling with the punches like damn like

332
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:42,440
I can make seeds like that's allowed and

333
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:44,439
while I'm while I'm doing that not too

334
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:47,839
many people knew who I was or gave a

335
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:50,839
[ __ ] right only the people that followed

336
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:53,199
me and then eventually I end up getting

337
00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:55,240
like the the tools to make Wilson and a

338
00:13:53,198 --> 00:13:58,799
couple other varieties on my second

339
00:13:55,240 --> 00:14:01,039
visit when uh Onie and Harry came to

340
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:03,519
Adelanto in California like two hours

341
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:05,838
away from Los Angeles and I drove my ass

342
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:09,879
down there to go meet Harry and he gave

343
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:12,600
me five papaya fem and a Tropicana F2

344
00:14:09,879 --> 00:14:15,919
and I took that back home grew them all

345
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:17,560
out and made some dope ass crosses and

346
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:18,919
that's kind of how it all unraveled you

347
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:21,278

nice I like it a lot and they had some

380
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:40,600
other [ __ ] there too but that's what I

381
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:42,360
went for I'm a I'm a sucker for you know

382

Candy and gas and [ __ ] like that they

383
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:47,199
had like some hazy [ __ ] and you know

384
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,440
some other [ __ ] um that's cool and all

385
00:15:47,198 --> 00:15:51,559
respectably no no disrespect but

386
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:54,360
anything but like I'm trying to smoke

387
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:57,318
some flavorful stuff right now you know

388
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:59,318
so if I had to ask you like you got a

389
00:15:57,318 --> 00:16:01,679
top strain of all time

390
00:15:59,318 --> 00:16:04,000
yeah man uh I guess it changes with the

391
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:07,278
times but right now it's Skittles is my

392
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,958
go-to I heard you saying that one that's

393
00:16:07,278 --> 00:16:11,318
and that's not too new at this point no

394
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:13,359
it's not that's pretty cool that that's

395
00:16:11,318 --> 00:16:15,599
stuck around for you what is it about

396
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:18,759
the Skittles that you like it's got the

397
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,759
perfect amount of

398
00:16:20,318 --> 00:16:26,120
like it's like a it's like a it's like a

399
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:29,559
it's not gas like sour or or like you

400
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:31,839
know like headband or or GMO or like

401
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:34,278
anything one might perceive as gas right

402
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:37,160
but it's its own type of like cush

403
00:16:34,278 --> 00:16:38,838
chronic gas like it's and and that I

404
00:16:37,159 --> 00:16:41,360
know I'm just describing like a strain

405
00:16:38,839 --> 00:16:44,160
like Kush like it's like its own type of

406
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,639
dope weed you know like when o came out

407
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:47,600
like everything that was just kind of

408
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:50,440
related to OG you wanted to smoke well

409
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:52,319
Skittles is the same thing every hybrid

410
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:54,079
and derivative of Skittles I'm like yeah

411
00:16:52,318 --> 00:16:55,919
that's good you know it's the same thing

412
00:16:54,078 --> 00:16:58,078
that happened with OG because there's

413
00:16:55,919 --> 00:17:00,838
like all the planetaries there's the sfv

414
00:16:58,078 --> 00:17:03,758
the sky Walker the Fire OG the the sour

415
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:05,038
diesel and they all I know Sour Diesel

416
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:06,558
and and OG they're kind of like you

417
00:17:05,038 --> 00:17:08,798
could separate them but they all fall in

418
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:11,078
that same realm because they're not piny

419
00:17:08,798 --> 00:17:13,439
they're not to me like as a as a smoker

420
00:17:11,078 --> 00:17:14,798
and as a as a seed maker and breeder

421
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:16,400
whatever like this is how I look at the

422
00:17:14,798 --> 00:17:17,798
plant this how yeah your answer is your

423
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,480
answer brother you don't gota [ __ ]

424
00:17:17,798 --> 00:17:22,078
explain it and I know how people are

425
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:24,798
they like that's not sour gas what are

426
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:24,798
you talking

427
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:32,759
about that's more of a fire and I'm like

428
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:32,759
gas fire yeah gases cause fire same

429
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:37,038
[ __ ] what's this smell like [ __ ]

430
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:39,160
smells like dirty monkey ass like you

431
00:17:37,038 --> 00:17:41,359
never smelled that one what yeah gmo's

432
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:43,279
more funky but you sometimes you find

433
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:45,879
that nice derivative of it that's got

434
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:48,279
some some gas in it you know I've

435
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:50,080
definitely been finding some like I do

436
00:17:48,279 --> 00:17:53,558
another show called The Washington weed

437
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:55,759
review because I feel like no matter

438
00:17:53,558 --> 00:17:57,599
what you guys all agree on there's

439
00:17:55,759 --> 00:17:59,319
something that we can all agree on

440
00:17:57,599 --> 00:18:00,399
that's [ __ ] medic and hom grow is

441
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:04,158
always going to be better than

442
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:07,480
dispensary like nine times out of 10

443
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:08,799
so but because of that we wanted to go

444
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:11,519
out there and we wanted to tell some of

445
00:18:08,798 --> 00:18:13,960
the guys local around Washington like yo

446
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:15,480
you are going to go to the dispo like

447
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,919
this one that I'm saying is pretty

448
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:18,400
[ __ ] good you know so we have been

449
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:20,280
trying out some hype [ __ ] and I've been

450
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,798
finding some stuff that I do like I

451
00:18:20,279 --> 00:18:24,158
heard you talking [ __ ] about the Oreos

452
00:18:22,798 --> 00:18:29,000

453
00:18:24,159 --> 00:18:31,880

don't like hate those are like tough

456
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,120
words for a plant like the plant didn't

457
00:18:36,558 --> 00:18:40,678
do nothing to me it's just the plant it

458
00:18:38,119 --> 00:18:44,359
just exist you know so I wouldn't say

459

that right I just don't like the the

460
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:50,558
Fanfare behind it right the the yo look

00:18:56,519 --> 00:19:02,000
smell but that smell you will never

465
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:05,400
taste no matter how well it's

466
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,839
grown I've had it five or 10 times from

467
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:10,960
different Growers and different shapes

468
00:19:06,839 --> 00:19:12,759
and forms and I like the smell it's like

469

don't it don't translate it it doesn't

472
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:23,038
do the the the job and in hash form and

473
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:26,720
in weed form I've yet to grab a Oreos or

474
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:30,558
or or hybrid of it uh that's that leans

475
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:32,600
Oreos that's like okay I get it now and

476
00:19:30,558 --> 00:19:35,639
and I'm not there's some strains that

477
00:19:32,599 --> 00:19:38,798
took me a while to get privy to but the

478
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:41,360
Oreos I I I can't accept the the the

479
00:19:38,798 --> 00:19:43,558
Fanfare behind it the like the other day

480
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:45,839
I seen uh I think they're still selling

481
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:48,399
that one strain zero gravity as as like

482
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:50,000
a as a thing I seen you know no no

483
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,880
disrespect I'm just calling out names

484
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,640
but I seen uh they just opened a

485
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:56,280
dispensary somewhere and they're like

486
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:59,120
doing this whole ad about how they got

487
00:19:56,279 --> 00:20:01,000
this dope ass drop on this or Oro strain

488
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:03,479
called zero gravity and they made this

489
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:06,679
whole video for it and I'm just

490
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:10,759
like that weed

491
00:20:06,679 --> 00:20:13,600
sucks I'm with you I'm with you bro okay

492
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:17,359
so since we're already in this realm

493
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:21,199
right here least favorite strain of all

494
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:23,439
time unless it is Oreos n i don't that's

495
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:27,200
a hard question uh least favorite strain

496
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:28,759
of all time [ __ ] you know it's got to be

497
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,319
one that you're just like I would never

498
00:20:28,759 --> 00:20:36,079
smoke that

499
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:39,119
again oh uh anything that's like uh like

500
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:42,480
perfumey whatever that means yeah you

501
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:44,119
know I I I love I don't disregard any

502
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,000
strains even the Oreos it's hard for me

503
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:48,000
to be like Ah that's the worst strain

504
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,319
because hey man you might be able to

505
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,960
breed with it I don't know one day I

506
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:53,359
might try it and I might like it but so

507
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:56,279
far the 10 times I've had it from cool

508
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:57,639
dudes n but I can't disregard a strain

509
00:20:56,279 --> 00:21:00,000
like that man it's just it hurts which

510
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:03,159
one's not good good for big Ma's

511
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,599
body don't put no train wreck in my dab

512
00:21:03,159 --> 00:21:06,320
[ __ ] you know I'll smoke it when I want

513
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:09,119
to smoke it but don't come over here

514
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:10,960
telling me train wreck and Jack hair is

515
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:12,439
the best turp in the world and I get it

516
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:15,079
it's like a old school thing and some

517
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:16,519
people really love it but don't tell me

518
00:21:15,079 --> 00:21:20,278
it's the best thing it's the best thing

519
00:21:16,519 --> 00:21:23,079
for you yeah yeah I'm with you I'm not

520
00:21:20,278 --> 00:21:24,919
I'm was never really huge on the jack I

521
00:21:23,079 --> 00:21:27,439
like the effect it's kind of uplifting

522
00:21:24,919 --> 00:21:29,600
but like the flavor I think a lot of

523
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:32,640
people that worked with it call it Jack

524
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:35,918
turps for a reason you know like it's

525
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:39,480
like that spicy kind of weak kind of you

526
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:43,440
know I'm not crazy about it either

527
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:45,159
so what if we took the Jack hair and we

528
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:48,600
bred that [ __ ] with Skittles would big

529
00:21:45,159 --> 00:21:51,000
May smoke that yo find a skittles leaner

530
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:53,240
with nuances from the jack it might go

531
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,278
down the [ __ ] throat nice you know

532
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:57,278
but find find a complete Jack leaner

533
00:21:55,278 --> 00:21:59,038
it's just another Jack it's like you

534
00:21:57,278 --> 00:22:03,480
could you could CR whatever you want to

535
00:21:59,038 --> 00:22:05,400
it if it leans Jack heavy like 60% or

536
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:07,079
more it's like hey bro you just just

537
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:09,679
like any other strain another GMO

538
00:22:07,079 --> 00:22:10,759
another Jack another [ __ ] this like

539
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:13,559
there there's strains that have been

540
00:22:10,759 --> 00:22:15,919
coined and and go find something new you

541
00:22:13,558 --> 00:22:17,480
know so you haven't found a skittles

542
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:20,600
cross that you don't

543
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:23,319
like not necessarily I found

544
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:24,839
Skittles uh batches that I don't like

545
00:22:23,319 --> 00:22:28,079
like uh the way it was grown and

546
00:22:24,839 --> 00:22:31,199
processed it's never necessarily the uh

547
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:34,158
the flavor cuz yeah in

548
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:36,319
mind quality right I smoke quality and

549
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:38,640
and it's like there's some flavors I'd

550
00:22:36,319 --> 00:22:40,798
rather not smoke but quality Skittles

551
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:44,799
and and most hybrid forms they check out

552
00:22:40,798 --> 00:22:46,278
[ __ ] yeah okay so we got touch on it I

553
00:22:44,798 --> 00:22:48,798
know a lot of people are wanting to hear

554
00:22:46,278 --> 00:22:51,079
about it some of the controversy behind

555
00:22:48,798 --> 00:22:54,599
big mace

556
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:58,278
uh what do you refer to yourself as do

557
00:22:54,599 --> 00:23:01,759
you consider yourself a breeder or you

558
00:22:58,278 --> 00:23:04,919
doing Ma thing when when uh when when

559
00:23:01,759 --> 00:23:07,278
dudes call themselves breeders and and I

560
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:10,360
I just feel like you know I'm very

561
00:23:07,278 --> 00:23:14,119
confident in in in where I've put myself

562
00:23:10,359 --> 00:23:16,038
right and I see a lot of like even to

563
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:18,000
this day like covid [ __ ] breeders and

564
00:23:16,038 --> 00:23:20,278
covid Growers and no disrespect but it's

565
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,440
like I never seen you [ __ ]

566
00:23:20,278 --> 00:23:24,759
outside and and and and and yeah you

567
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:26,919
might be inside but it's like a lot of

568
00:23:24,759 --> 00:23:30,079
echo chamber [ __ ] going on and and and

569
00:23:26,919 --> 00:23:32,200
and and just see myself as me but if I

570
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:35,359
have to put on my breeder hat and be

571
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:37,360
like hey man [ __ ] you guys like I do the

572
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:39,479
same [ __ ] you do and if you call

573
00:23:37,359 --> 00:23:41,639
yourself a [ __ ] breeder well [ __ ] I

574
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:43,440
guess I'm one too [ __ ] you know

575
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:45,840
but whatever you want to call me but

576
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:48,519
make sure [ __ ] put the big on front

577
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:48,519

578
00:23:50,119 --> 00:23:56,759
just fair enough good answer good answer

579
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:58,400
man uh so let's talk about your breeding

580
00:23:56,759 --> 00:24:00,960
practices a little bit

581
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,759
uh how do you go I know you've got a

582
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,798
whole book by the way guys go check it

583

available it's all any I got the

586
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:13,360
breeding book selection guide the

587
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:16,520
pollination guide all shout out green

588
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:18,599
pine logo trees it's a concept that uh

589
00:24:16,519 --> 00:24:20,599
he's an artist and and a [ __ ] teacher

590
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:23,278
out in New York he's a college professor

591
00:24:20,599 --> 00:24:25,359
of some sort he teaches art and uh he

592
00:24:23,278 --> 00:24:27,640
does uh some logos for some of the guys

593
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:29,439
in the Cannabis scene and uh I reached

594
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:31,679
out to him I was like hey man put this

595
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:34,360
[ __ ] on paper for me because uh you know

596
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:36,320
it's it's something that feels right for

597
00:24:34,359 --> 00:24:38,158
for for the people you know no one has

598
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:40,278
done this before or and if they have you

599
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:41,760
know [ __ ] I want to do it too you know I

600
00:24:40,278 --> 00:24:43,359
don't think anybody's done it the way

601
00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:45,960
that you did it it's pretty damn cool

602
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:48,519
that you used your influence because

603
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:50,840
obviously you know you you've still got

604
00:24:48,519 --> 00:24:53,480
that same Vibe you got the Pokemon the

605
00:24:50,839 --> 00:24:55,599
[ __ ] Yu-Gi-Oh like I think it's dope

606
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:57,200
man because I'm into that [ __ ] too not

607
00:24:55,599 --> 00:24:58,759
so much to Yu-Gi-Oh I saw you playing

608
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,278
that earlier I never really got in that

609
00:24:58,759 --> 00:25:02,119
but like Pokemon like some of the old

610
00:25:00,278 --> 00:25:04,079
cards from back then [ __ ] yeah dude that

611
00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:06,199
[ __ ] was cool as [ __ ] like that's what

612
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:07,599
we did we never really played the games

613
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:09,120
back then it was more about collecting

614
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:11,000
cars but it was still [ __ ] fun you

615
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:13,359
know even the [ __ ] Game Boy games and

616
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:16,398
[ __ ] that was my jam like that's the

617
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:18,759
vibe I grew up with uh so that you took

618
00:25:16,398 --> 00:25:20,439
that influence and brought it to

619
00:25:18,759 --> 00:25:23,278
cannabis for a breeding guy and like

620
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:25,038
made a comic book thing I like that I

621
00:25:23,278 --> 00:25:28,319
like that Vibe a lot and it was

622
00:25:25,038 --> 00:25:30,398
something that you know people had done

623
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:32,839
but not necessarily in the way that you

624
00:25:30,398 --> 00:25:36,319
did it you definitely brought your whole

625
00:25:32,839 --> 00:25:38,678
[ __ ] new thing to it so go check that

626
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:41,759
out guys if you do want to learn more

627
00:25:38,679 --> 00:25:45,120
about uh Masonic breeding practices his

628
00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:48,679
selection guide all that uh I know a lot

629
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:51,000
of people know you for your Wilson

630
00:25:48,679 --> 00:25:53,720
mail like we were talking about earlier

631
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,839
you got something proven uh you

632
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:58,440
definitely want to hit that on some

633
00:25:55,839 --> 00:26:00,839
proven Fe females and if you got proven

634
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:03,880
lines on both that you know what you can

635
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:05,599
kind of expect from each one uh that I

636
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:09,880
mean there's not

637
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:13,879
really much margin for error you know uh

638
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:16,399
what what would you say is now current

639
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:18,960
Masonic seeds what would you say is your

640
00:26:16,398 --> 00:26:20,839
breeding practice you say you do pick

641
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:23,159
out a lot of females and you kind of try

642
00:26:20,839 --> 00:26:25,199
to pack as much space you can is it all

643
00:26:23,159 --> 00:26:27,679
Wilson still or are you doing multiple

644
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,759
males I uh so i' I've spread out my

645
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:33,360
tentacles a little bit uh it used to be

646
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:35,720
solely Wilson hybrids all I did is

647
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:38,719
Wilson I'll do a couple side missions i'

648
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:40,880
pick a m From Any Given seed pack that I

649
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:44,360
popped and if I deemed it special or

650
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:46,760
worthy I'd reach out to X people and be

651
00:26:44,359 --> 00:26:48,839
like yo go make some seeds you know give

652
00:26:46,759 --> 00:26:51,519
me half at the end and you know call it

653
00:26:48,839 --> 00:26:54,398
a day and whoever did that you know all

654
00:26:51,519 --> 00:26:56,720
power to them and uh so i' I've done a

655
00:26:54,398 --> 00:26:59,519
couple hybrids besides the Wilson lane

656
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:03,399
and then I time started to

657
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:05,679
unravel uh I just I I have a whole

658
00:27:03,398 --> 00:27:09,879
different thought process and as of last

659
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:11,798
year I uh I just let the MS go like

660
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:15,360
we're just we're just making seeds now

661
00:27:11,798 --> 00:27:18,000
like uh and and in that way and and so

662
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:20,359
I'd like we pop x amount of

663
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,720
seeds we're we're scratching our chin

664
00:27:20,359 --> 00:27:25,398
thinking about what Mel we're going to

665
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:26,319
breed with n we just leave them all what

666
00:27:25,398 --> 00:27:30,038
do you mean just leave them all just

667
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:32,480
leave them all but just leave them all

668
00:27:30,038 --> 00:27:36,240
people grow them just like any other

669
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:38,200
pack of seeds get great weed on to the

670
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:41,120
next one and are we talking about

671
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:43,759
multiple males from the same line like

672
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:45,918
almost like an OP or different lines

673
00:27:43,759 --> 00:27:48,720
different lines it's just okay so if I

674
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:50,960
get a pack of like a papaya cross from

675
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:54,759
you it could be a papaya this papaya

676
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:57,278

728
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:06,960
years ago when I was doing my first

729
00:30:05,278 --> 00:30:09,200
Wilson blast one of my first Wilson

730
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,880
blasts where I just hit it to everything

731
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:13,278
I was like counting my eggs before they

732
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:15,360
hatched and I posted a story I was like

733
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:17,359
yo check it out guys future cross is

734
00:30:15,359 --> 00:30:20,199
coming like I literally posted all the

735
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:21,719
seeds that I popped cross to Wilson and

736
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:25,278
I think it was like jungle boys are

737
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:28,759
capulator they like they post and

738
00:30:25,278 --> 00:30:32,960
they're just like look at this guy you

739
00:30:28,759 --> 00:30:36,440
know I'm like let's go you know f look

740
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:40,558
at me now people are like yo I'm like I

741
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:42,200
don't they're sold out gone you have

742
00:30:40,558 --> 00:30:44,678
different categories of your seeds you

743
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:47,319
got the fem you got the B crosses F2 F3

744
00:30:44,679 --> 00:30:49,000
are sold out sorry uh and now you're

745
00:30:47,319 --> 00:30:52,319
doing this kind of thing with all the

746
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:54,038
different males is there different

747
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:55,638
prices that reflect those different

748
00:30:54,038 --> 00:30:58,919
categories or is everything about the

749
00:30:55,638 --> 00:31:01,199
same so I'm still doing single uh Mel

750
00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:03,159
pollinations in between you know we get

751
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:05,038
like three four seasons over here so

752
00:31:03,159 --> 00:31:06,480
like I'll do I did a honey banana Wilson

753
00:31:05,038 --> 00:31:09,000
that's my other stud that I created the

754
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:11,880
Willie be so I did align with him I did

755
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:14,079
a light dep with two tunnels and just

756
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:15,639
hit a bunch of things with the willieb

757
00:31:14,079 --> 00:31:19,439
and so I squeezed that in before the

758
00:31:15,638 --> 00:31:23,000
full term and the full term now uh I

759
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:25,919
mean the price points reflect on the

760
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:28,159
scarcity of set pack but I don't I never

761
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:30,080
like to reach like 80 is where I'm like

762
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:32,720
all right cool we could both leave happy

763
00:31:30,079 --> 00:31:34,278
for untested varieties right and and

764
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,720
I'll throw in some pork barrel where

765
00:31:34,278 --> 00:31:38,000
where like you get an extra pack and

766
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:41,159
some or not because I totally believe in

767
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,919
that product right or or uh or

768
00:31:41,159 --> 00:31:45,360
everything else like [ __ ] you make a

769
00:31:42,919 --> 00:31:46,440
million seeds in your backyard I'm not

770
00:31:45,359 --> 00:31:48,119
I'm not you know trying to make a

771
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:50,038
million dollars I'm just I want to get

772
00:31:48,119 --> 00:31:52,558
by and make some I'll I'll meet you guys

773
00:31:50,038 --> 00:31:55,519
somewhere around 2530 sometimes I'll

774
00:31:52,558 --> 00:31:57,519
make some bundle sets where it'll

775
00:31:55,519 --> 00:32:00,679
incentivize the sell where in instead of

776
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:02,599
like them spending 25 to 30 on a pack

777
00:32:00,679 --> 00:32:04,960
they'll come with four packs and they'll

778
00:32:02,599 --> 00:32:07,000
level out to 15 to 20 a packs so there's

779
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:09,200
like like I'm the I'm the breeder and

780
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,398
the seller so I got to find ways to

781
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:14,360
incentivize and put my product that I

782
00:32:11,398 --> 00:32:16,839
stand behind in people's hands and and

783
00:32:14,359 --> 00:32:19,240
it's and it's and it's a you know it's

784
00:32:16,839 --> 00:32:23,199
and and and I I know like it's like

785
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:25,120
driving the masses around like I'm just

786
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:27,278
like pulling teeth sometimes on trying

787
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:29,479
to like explain to them like I'm the man

788
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:31,278
I'm the man it's like first place look

789
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:33,759
guys first place and they're just like

790
00:32:31,278 --> 00:32:36,880
this guy's crazy but hey man [ __ ] you

791
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:41,200
got to be crazy to do what I do that's a

792
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:43,840
fact that is a fact uh okay so there is

793
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:46,200
a little bit of price difference but no

794
00:32:43,839 --> 00:32:47,918
nothing crazy especially with today you

795
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:49,240
know with people that are working lines

796
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:53,000
constantly and they're selling their

797
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:54,200
[ __ ] [ __ ] we all know who like I got to

798
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,480
shout out names but there's

1021
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:40,280

1022
00:41:37,559 --> 00:41:41,719
I've had to weird [ __ ] around me who

1023

knows it could have been like a [ __ ]

1024
00:41:41,719 --> 00:41:46,719
plane or something but to me that looked

1025
00:41:43,719 --> 00:41:48,799
like a very still object and then it

1026
00:41:46,719 --> 00:41:50,199
disappeared and then we just went on our

1027
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:52,560

1037
00:42:19,838 --> 00:42:23,838
when the aliens finally show up do you

1038
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:27,039
think they have their own version of

1039
00:42:23,838 --> 00:42:28,639
cannabis and do you think it's like here

1040
00:42:27,039 --> 00:42:30,318
where the aliens have the Cannabis

1041
00:42:28,639 --> 00:42:32,400
culture and they have pictures of humans

1042
00:42:30,318 --> 00:42:35,960

have their own version of cannabis n

1046
00:42:39,679 --> 00:42:43,440
just go with that I think they'll be

1047
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:46,680
Beyond cannabis I think they'll be here

1048

for you know other purposes you know

1049

when I stepped on the scene from the

1114
00:45:20,519 --> 00:45:24,719
people that I looked up to you go hunt

1115
00:45:22,358 --> 00:45:26,960
to Mel and you build a line and you keep

1116
00:45:24,719 --> 00:45:29,239
your Mel around that way cross it back

1117
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:31,920
to the Mel and just just do true

1118
00:45:29,239 --> 00:45:33,639
breeding and that's how I looked at it

1119
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:35,400
and uh that's why I kept my Mel around

1120
00:45:33,639 --> 00:45:38,719
because you know that's that's part of

1121
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:41,358
my legacy speaking about males uh Big

1122
00:45:38,719 --> 00:45:44,358
Bad John wants to know male selections

1123
00:45:41,358 --> 00:45:48,159
what do you look for

1124
00:45:44,358 --> 00:45:49,440
so so like when you're making a cross

1125
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:51,799
you're making a

1126
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:54,240
cross if you're basing it on structure

1127
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:55,960
I'll power to you I don't base my plants

1128
00:45:54,239 --> 00:45:58,199
on structure it's just kind of a given

1129
00:45:55,960 --> 00:46:00,519
right like hopefully it has enough

1130
00:45:58,199 --> 00:46:02,480
structure most of the time they do so

1131
00:46:00,519 --> 00:46:05,199
that's cool and all structure is fine

1132
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:07,838
biomass is fine but flavor turps that's

1133
00:46:05,199 --> 00:46:10,159
what we're after so if we're trying to

1134
00:46:07,838 --> 00:46:12,440
make a hybrid of for me for instance I'm

1135
00:46:10,159 --> 00:46:15,440
trying to make shishka Berry hybrids and

1136
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:19,358
honey banana hybrids and and headbanger

1137
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:21,599
hybrids so first thing I would do is to

1138
00:46:19,358 --> 00:46:24,799
grab those tools and I would go grab

1139
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:27,838
head banger seeds shishco Berry

1140
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:29,559
seeds X X seeds whatever you grow those

1141
00:46:27,838 --> 00:46:31,880
out

1142
00:46:29,559 --> 00:46:35,960
visually some will grow better than

1143
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:38,000
others right that's cool that's fine but

1144
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:40,440
some of them will start to

1145
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,838
like Mel's right visually you start to

1146
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:43,280
choose oh that's a run that's a run

1147
00:46:41,838 --> 00:46:45,480
you're left if you pop 12 seeds you're

1148
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:47,599
left you got six seeds two of them suck

1149
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:49,719
you're left with four then kind of you

1150
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:51,640
know start stem rubbing start look at

1151
00:46:49,719 --> 00:46:54,439
the females if you flowered out the

1152
00:46:51,639 --> 00:46:56,960
females you kind of notice like if

1153
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:58,679
there's two ways to to lean like I'll

1154
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:01,880
give you an example barbera's pie I

1155
00:46:58,679 --> 00:47:04,239
popped a regular pack of barbera's pie

1156
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:06,599
um some of them lean towards the train

1157
00:47:04,239 --> 00:47:07,959
wreck [ __ ] which is not my selection

1158
00:47:06,599 --> 00:47:12,119
right like that's not something I would

1159
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:15,960
want to encapsulate and sell to you

1160
00:47:12,119 --> 00:47:17,160
knowingly like yo not knowingly but I

1161
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:18,720
mean it in the sense like I'm not going

1162
00:47:17,159 --> 00:47:20,000
to sell train wreck to you I'll sell

1163
00:47:18,719 --> 00:47:23,519
train wreck to you but I'm going to tell

1164
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:25,960
you it's train R right yeah so Barber's

1165
00:47:23,519 --> 00:47:27,559
pie you're growing your Barber pi or

1166
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:30,760
whatever [ __ ] selection you're aiming

1167
00:47:27,559 --> 00:47:33,079
for and and you elude the this is just a

1168
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:36,119
way of doing it you elude that stem rub

1169
00:47:33,079 --> 00:47:38,400
from that female leaning you know

1170
00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:40,680
[ __ ] feno or whatever and you kind of

1171
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:41,838
go look for that in the MS but you got

1172
00:47:40,679 --> 00:47:44,239
to keep in mind when you're doing

1173
00:47:41,838 --> 00:47:45,679
selection you're alluding to your bar

1174
00:47:44,239 --> 00:47:47,519
what is your bar your bar is your

1175
00:47:45,679 --> 00:47:51,039
experience what is your experience your

1176
00:47:47,519 --> 00:47:54,400
experience is how many seeds you

1177
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:56,960
physically tangibly grown yourself

1178
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:59,440
that's all you know so like your

1179
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:01,440
selection is this most of the time

1180
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:03,358
because a lot of people haven't popped

1181
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:06,400
let alone seen that many things not

1182
00:48:03,358 --> 00:48:08,960
saying that you haven't but that was my

1183
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:11,440
process going through the ringer it's

1184
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:13,920
like oh as I went by now I know what

1185
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:15,960
bandid Haz is now I know what A5 is now

1186
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:17,800
I know what C4 is now I know what Dosey

1187
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:20,039
is now like I know what all these things

1188
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:22,280
are because I grew

1189
00:48:20,039 --> 00:48:24,920
them so that's all part of your

1190
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:26,880
selection process is like what you know

1191
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:29,760
and just kind of narrowing it down and

1192
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:31,640
and finding that flavor and making

1193
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:34,079
hybrids with

1194
00:48:31,639 --> 00:48:35,679
it I got to ask you this really quick

1195
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:37,760
before we get back to you guys'

1196
00:48:35,679 --> 00:48:40,879
questions uh because we talked about

1197
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:43,160
this not too long ago you seem pretty on

1198
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:45,280
par with about what I do too how do you

1199
00:48:43,159 --> 00:48:48,759
feel about some of the people that like

1200
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:50,839
some of the runs are some of the best

1201
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:52,119
ones cool they might have some of the

1202
00:48:50,838 --> 00:48:55,199
test

1203
00:48:52,119 --> 00:48:58,079
[ __ ] that's not your thing hey not your

1204
00:48:55,199 --> 00:49:00,519
no not that it's not my thing

1205
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:02,480
like sometimes you find turps that you

1206
00:49:00,519 --> 00:49:04,798
won't find in a big plant on a small

1207
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:07,480
plant look at Skittles and [ __ ] right

1208
00:49:04,798 --> 00:49:10,239
when we did the blue Magoo back cross

1209
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:12,159
twice uh I did a big old hunt of that

1210
00:49:10,239 --> 00:49:15,078
which I didn't know at the time I really

1211
00:49:12,159 --> 00:49:17,159
didn't have to do that big of a hunt uh

1212
00:49:15,079 --> 00:49:19,160
but we did Big Old Hunt of that and we

1213
00:49:17,159 --> 00:49:21,318
had some runs and I did keep them just

1214
00:49:19,159 --> 00:49:23,598
because we had the space uh and they

1215
00:49:21,318 --> 00:49:25,920
were [ __ ] crazy Frosty and they were

1216
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:29,359
[ __ ] amazing and I actually kept the

1217
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:31,400
Clone off the one uh but like selection

1218
00:49:29,358 --> 00:49:33,798
breeding wise that wouldn't be my [ __ ]

1219
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:36,720
because I'm after that Vigor like that's

1220
00:49:33,798 --> 00:49:40,480
a big deal for me if the

1221
00:49:36,719 --> 00:49:42,798
TPS the [ __ ] high are on point and

1222
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:44,920
it's a vigorous [ __ ] like that's what I

1223
00:49:42,798 --> 00:49:48,440
would want to breed with you know yeah

1224
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:50,358
and I'll [ __ ] take that amount and

1225
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:52,400
pull that down to like what's the best

1226
00:49:50,358 --> 00:49:54,199
of that fits that description that's

1227
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:57,519
going to be my that's going to be my

1228
00:49:54,199 --> 00:50:00,960
[ __ ] so steal says I heard about Masonic

1229
00:49:57,519 --> 00:50:03,318
from a pack of Chile Riano Chile veric

1230
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:06,000
cost with Wilson is there anything else

1231
00:50:03,318 --> 00:50:09,039
you have with the Chile Verde still have

1232
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:11,239
my chile verde seed stock uh but I never

1233
00:50:09,039 --> 00:50:14,239
Revisited the Chile Verde clone it was a

1234
00:50:11,239 --> 00:50:17,399
kind of just I did what I had to do with

1235
00:50:14,239 --> 00:50:20,318
that and I don't see me revisiting that

1236
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:22,480
line until maybe later on in life where

1237
00:50:20,318 --> 00:50:24,000
I run out of Chile Verde seed stock I

1238
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:27,000
might pop some more of my chile verde

1239
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:28,880
Wilson find a nice CH Verde leer and

1240
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:31,599
some other stuff and just repopulate

1241
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:33,000
those lines it's a good question Dan

1242
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:35,599
thanks for bringing this up I didn't

1243
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:40,079
even think about that uh where' the name

1244
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:43,318
Wilson come from so Wilson is a cross

1245
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:47,318
between uh a string called castaway and

1246
00:50:43,318 --> 00:50:50,719
Tropicana Castaway is banana OG papaya

1247
00:50:47,318 --> 00:50:53,159
uh so it was a play on words uh I I

1248
00:50:50,719 --> 00:50:56,480
didn't name Wilson Oni named Wilson when

1249
00:50:53,159 --> 00:50:58,598
I made the strains for Onie uh that's

1250
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:01,358
how it's easier to sell seeds when they

1251
00:50:58,599 --> 00:51:03,280
have a [ __ ] name so they named them

1252
00:51:01,358 --> 00:51:05,759
and uh I just kind of stuck with it and

1253
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:07,519
it turned into a life of its own and I'm

1254
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:10,000
glad they [ __ ] called it Wilson

1255
00:51:07,519 --> 00:51:12,039
because Wilson is super [ __ ] like

1256
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,838
culturally relevant every time I turn on

1257
00:51:12,039 --> 00:51:15,480
the TV the name Wilson's there every

1258
00:51:13,838 --> 00:51:18,358
time I open a book there's something

1259
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:21,440
about Wilson [ __ ] Tom Hanks this

1260
00:51:18,358 --> 00:51:23,759
[ __ ] uh Forest Gump that so it's

1261
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:25,760
always like this proximity that always

1262
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:27,880
ties back to the greatness behind the

1263
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:30,119
name and it it just the universe blessed

1264
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:30,920
me with a dope uh Flagship strain name

1265
00:51:30,119 --> 00:51:33,400
for

1266
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:35,599
sure uh dank Panda wants to know

1267
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:39,280
favorite cross that you've ever

1268
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:43,480
created um maybe Wilson uh as as time

1269
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:45,920
has gone by Wilson itself as as like the

1270
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:48,240
F1 or like any of the generations or the

1271
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:49,599
hybrids of it it's it's special in its

1272
00:51:48,239 --> 00:51:51,719
own way that it's not another

1273
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:53,920
regurgitation of the strains that were

1274
00:51:51,719 --> 00:51:56,639
used to make it so it's not necessarily

1275
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:59,318
another papaya or another Tropicana it's

1276
00:51:56,639 --> 00:52:02,239
its own tropical mix that has stood the

1277
00:51:59,318 --> 00:52:05,318
test of time since like 2017 till today

1278

1305
00:53:05,798 --> 00:53:09,599
a chickens I raised chickens i' I've

1306
00:53:07,798 --> 00:53:12,838
raised chickens for a little over 10

1307
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:15,880
years I got [ __ ] so many chickens at my

1308
00:53:12,838 --> 00:53:18,279
house we get eggs and they're like pets

1309
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:21,280
and they give us eggs so they they

1310
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:23,319
fertilize a little bit they do their job

1311
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:26,000
they fertilize and then you use them

1312
00:53:23,318 --> 00:53:28,639
kind of like it's part of your IPM huh

1313
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:30,400
I mean they there ain't no slugs at that

1314
00:53:28,639 --> 00:53:32,558
place you know I ain't got no snails or

1315
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:34,119
nothing like that like I'm as far as

1316
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:36,160
Critters on the ground we're pretty

1317
00:53:34,119 --> 00:53:39,640
clean man hell yeah they [ __ ] clean

1318
00:53:36,159 --> 00:53:42,078
up nice IPM sure we always had chickens

1319
00:53:39,639 --> 00:53:44,838
growing up too but yeah never did have

1320
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:47,079
them around my [ __ ] weed plant

1321
00:53:44,838 --> 00:53:48,679
like I think we'd use some of the

1322
00:53:47,079 --> 00:53:50,119
chicken [ __ ] to grow with and everything

1323
00:53:48,679 --> 00:53:51,838
but never just had them like free

1324
00:53:50,119 --> 00:53:53,720
roaming around the plants that's pretty

1325
00:53:51,838 --> 00:53:54,960
cool seeing like some of your pictures

1326
00:53:53,719 --> 00:53:57,078
you're growing [ __ ] and they're just

1327
00:53:54,960 --> 00:54:00,358
like wandering around [ __ ] feeding

1328
00:53:57,079 --> 00:54:02,880
them and [ __ ] that's pretty smart too uh

1329
00:54:00,358 --> 00:54:05,239
