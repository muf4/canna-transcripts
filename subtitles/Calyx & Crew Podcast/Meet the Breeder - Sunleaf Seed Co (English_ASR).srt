00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:54,718
repopulate land races he's going to talk

26
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:57,038
about that sinai that i grew that

27
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,879
beautiful egyptian land race we're going

28
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:01,679
to talk about replicating environments

29
00:00:58,878 --> 00:01:03,039
with some of these land races as well as

30
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:05,198
sun leaf's

31
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:07,439
intuition of getting into growing what

32
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:09,118
got him into breeding and where he sees

33
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:11,039
suddenly seed company going in the

34
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:12,400
future we appreciate having him on we

35
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,680
got him on the other line right now so

36
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,159
let's just jump into the episode

37
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,560
suddenly how you doing my brother

38
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,880
doing well

39
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,680
absolutely thanks for coming on

40
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:22,798
so

41
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,799
before we

42
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,200
really get deep into things

43
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:29,360
i wanted to reiterate for people that

44
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:32,320
may not be acquainted with sun leaf seed

45
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:34,478
company who are you where are you from

46
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:36,798
what are you all about

47
00:01:34,478 --> 00:01:38,959
well we're based out of colorado

48
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,960
primarily right now we've done a lot of

49
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:43,759
multi-state work

50
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:45,359
um over the past few years

51
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,920
but

52
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:49,759
what we're all about is breeding speed

53
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,840
for everybody basically

54
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:53,118
we want to encompass the market being

55
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,520
able to have

56
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:57,920
high cbd hccs

57
00:01:55,519 --> 00:02:00,399
uh strains that will be

58
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,920
good for people who are you know some of

59
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,799
these new states coming up you don't

60
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:07,759
have people who are wanting to smoke 30

61
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,719
chp strains so we have some stuff that

62
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:10,080
you know

63
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:11,840
you would consider

64
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,599
would be considered missed

65
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,280
as far as the market would go as far as

66
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:17,679
php testing but

67
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,800
uh people still really like it we also

68
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:23,520
have those really great high testing php

69
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:26,160
streams and um

70
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,560
land race streams which we really

71
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:29,680
uh those ones we really hope here

72
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,759
because

73
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,840
of preservation you know as the

74
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:38,159
legalization worldwide

75
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,959
become more prevalent um these kind of

76
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:40,400
old

77
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,680
strains that have

78
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,719
been

79
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,560
the backbone to all of our creations uh

80
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:48,159
can get lost

81
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,280
with all the

82
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:53,919
contamination and huge hemp fields

83
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,800
actually that have been authorized to

84
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:56,079
grow

85
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,760
in our

86
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,800
whole country and other countries as

87
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:00,399
well

88
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,840
has really been

89
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,760
one of those

90
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,959
rushes to

91
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:07,598
people

92
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,439
to preserving

93
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:13,439
so that is

94
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:16,479
a lot of what we do is preservation

95
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:19,039
preservation breeding and um

96
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:21,199
breeding hybrids that mainly like create

97
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:22,158
hybrids i like to know

98
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:23,439
you know

99
00:03:22,158 --> 00:03:25,759
and in turn

100
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:26,719
a lot of other people like to help you

101
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:27,759
so

102
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:29,120
um

103
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:33,280
that's kind of where we're at with our

104
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,280
breeding i like to make something that

105
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:41,518
right so well that's you know i

106
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:42,719
appreciate you mentioning that because a

107
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,360
lot of people

108
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:47,919
um don't mention that we talk about land

109
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,159
races a lot on my show

110
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:52,158
we talk about land races a lot on the

111
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:53,919
live shows as well but one of the things

112
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:56,079
that doesn't get brought up very often

113
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:58,000
is why it's important to preserve these

114
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,200
genetics that they are going away that

115
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,280
there is

116
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:03,518
climate and environmental factors that

117
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,438
are eroding and taking away some of

118
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:08,000
these populations so yeah they're

119
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:09,519
special for them to be watered down you

120
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,840
know or get

121
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,039
pollinated and you know these farmers

122
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,479
aren't

123
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:16,959
these farmers don't have a lot of money

124
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:18,798
in these uh areas

125
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,560
and uh

126
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:23,599
you know they're they're making fees for

127
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,839
their next season consistently so um

128
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,919
pollination contaminated

129
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:29,359
uh crop you know it could be a

130
00:04:27,918 --> 00:04:31,599
devastating thing

131
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,720
in a forever change the

132
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,919
variety so absolutely

133
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,080
yeah it's something that we feel

134
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:39,680
important but also it's really great for

135
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:40,839
people to play with too

136
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,600
it's really

137
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:45,599
interesting but that's not all what you

138
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,120
do you don't strictly do preservation

139
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,840
efforts right

140
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,120
no

141
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:54,319
no you like to make um poly hybrid

142
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:57,040
modern modern style hybrid you know

143
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:58,719
and what's your goal with that

144
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,600
high phd

145
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,120
um and the effect you know obviously uh

146
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,280
we're breeding for you know when you're

147
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,759
breeding for production which is what i

148
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:09,758
would consider like modern day

149
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,600
flowers you know most people want

150
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,840
american meals

151
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,759
so you know these are all secondhand

152
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:17,439
things i consider you know like of

153
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,479
course i want to breed for yield and

154
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:19,680
quality

155
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:21,918
so it's

156
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,478
kind of given that when we're working

157
00:05:21,918 --> 00:05:26,478
these modern lines like

158
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:28,879
the goals we're trying to achieve

159
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:30,639
you know uh high thc

160
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:31,918
uh bag appeal

161
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,720
uh yield

162
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:34,079
um

163
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,080
all you know these are all things that

164
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:37,758
benefit the farmer so that's another

165
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:39,599
thing you know that's from secondhand is

166
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,038
like we're we're all about the farmer

167
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,840
you know the growers

168
00:05:41,038 --> 00:05:42,639
and

169
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:44,319
um

170
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:45,360
really trying to elevate trains to the

171
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:46,478
point where

172
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,759
you know

173
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:50,399
if you've ever grown some of these

174
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:52,080
varieties that have been hyped up you'd

175
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:53,599
be like oh yeah it's really great but it

176
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:54,959
doesn't feel very much you know you

177
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,960
wouldn't do a whole

178
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:58,560
garden of it you know so

179
00:05:56,959 --> 00:06:00,719
um these are the kind of things we're

180
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,360
trying to do with our breeding

181
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,440
kind of bring up bring lines up to

182
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,439
production

183
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:08,959
so not only are you preserving some of

184
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:11,600
these land races but you're trying to

185
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:13,918
work them into modern hybrids so people

186
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,600
get what they want out of

187
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:18,240
you know what they see

188
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,400
one of the more modern cultivars but

189
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,879
incorporating the medicinal benefits of

190
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:23,679
those land races into that

191
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:25,120
yeah

192
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,319
that's awesome you know

193
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,560
there is

194
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:31,280
a split between you know i

195
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:34,399
we work quite a few projects and

196
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:36,559
i do have lots of um f1

197
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:38,638
hybrids i would i would call them like

198
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,519
very similar to f1 where you're taking

199
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,000
two

200
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:43,599
inbred lines and um

201
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,600
braiding them together and that probably

202
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:49,280
is very uniform but what you'll find

203
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:51,759
with our direct landrite hybrids

204
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:52,959
they're very very uniform just like an

205
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,240
f1 would be

206
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:56,560
and these ones you're going to find the

207
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,960
most medicinal properties you will find

208
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,800
the some lean towards

209
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:03,198
the land rays some lean towards the

210
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,199
modern

211
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,160
inbreeding towards you know whatever

212
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:20,159
you're looking for

213
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,240
but it's very

214
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,560
medicinal like these these strains that

215
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,478
we're working that are android hybrids

216
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,879
they're very medicinal properties

217
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:31,279
they don't have very high thc most of

218
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:32,959
them but they're really great they have

219
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:35,598
they're really great for breeding

220
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:37,839
they'll take um

221
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:40,719
qualities that you don't see in the

222
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:42,719
modern cultivars like pest resistance

223
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,639
mildew and mold resistant

224
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,759
you know and really be able to bump that

225
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,759
up

226
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:50,080
so

227
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:52,000
it leaves it's like a stepping stone a

228
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:54,240
lot of some of the work we're doing is

229
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,959
creating stepping stones that you you

230
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,519
know

231
00:07:54,959 --> 00:08:00,159
cutting out some of the work that you

232
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:02,240
don't have to do but so you can

233
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,439
you know pick up where we where we

234
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,840
started it

235
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:07,439
and that's another one of our goals is

236
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:08,560
you know get people into breeding their

237
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:11,360
own needs

238
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,478
and uh using tools

239
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,439
like

240
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:17,680
uh land rate genetics to be able to

241
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:20,160
you know help them breed

242
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,079
stuff that isn't going to

243
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,000
um

244
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:26,079
that is going to be successful for them

245
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,079
you know for whatever their moment i'll

246
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:29,839
make an autoflower or

247
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:32,240
you know maybe making something more

248
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:33,439
medicinal you know

249
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,320
absolutely

250
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:38,479
that's awesome we do have a couple

251
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,800
different styles of breathing

252
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:43,599
we do this strictly land right breeding

253
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:46,079
where we're preserving a land rate we do

254
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:48,240
the land rate hybridization where we're

255
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:51,200
using all the modern cultivars with the

256
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:54,959
land rate and then i'm doing

257
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,959
the normal style breeding

258
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,760
some of these some of these lines have

259
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:06,240
worked quite extensively and then i'll

260
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:08,480
toss them to the modern cultivars

261
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,320
you'll see in some of our seats that it

262
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,399
really brings up the

263
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,760
um yields and

264
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:18,480
size of the cyclone so um

265
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:18,480
it's really like

266
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:22,639
a guided work on summer

267
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,920
that's awesome man we really respect you

268
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:29,838
for doing that too um

269
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:32,719
what are you know one of the things i

270
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:34,320
like to ask all my guests especially my

271
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,560
guests that are breeders

272
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,760
is out of all the work that you've ever

273
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:38,559
done

274
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:40,639
what

275
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:43,679
types have you made that you say

276
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:44,720
represent your work the best

277
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:46,759
um

278
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:50,320
you know i

279
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:52,159
actually um

280
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:55,200
i would have to say that some of the

281
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:56,480
stuff that i don't consistently grow

282
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:00,399
but it would be

283
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:02,560
the land right hybrid um just because

284
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,480
it seems like people get so much joy out

285
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:06,958
of growing them

286
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:09,600
um and it makes me feel good that i made

287
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:12,559
it you know to make other people happy

288
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,600
but just the fact that

289
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:15,039
um

290
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,720
they're so unique

291
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:18,719
and you don't see a lot of people doing

292
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,600
that um

293
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,440
these days and

294
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,600
yeah

295
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,399
out of those land race hybrids which one

296
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,399
of

297
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:30,399
them would you say is your favorite

298
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:32,479
um

299
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,720
wow

300
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,480
they're all unique in their own way to

301
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,440
be honest like

302
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,680
you know

303
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,120
each one has its own different quality

304
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:42,000
that's what's so special about these

305
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,480
plants

306
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,839
yeah you know you go the lebanese

307
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:50,639
there's going to be so cbd-rich um it's

308
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:52,959
not very i wouldn't say very low but

309
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:55,679
moderately low cc and even in some of

310
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:57,518
the phenotypes that you can find

311
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:59,919
these are really great medicinal plants

312
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:00,639
and then you go over just a little bit

313
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:01,838
the

314
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:05,120
egyptian

315
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:08,560
and all of a sudden you know there's no

316
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,759
there's no cbd nearly and it's it's much

317
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:12,159
higher

318
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:14,559
and it's all bred for effect

319
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:17,519
you know i gotta tell you that makes me

320
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:19,199
really really happy because that's and i

321
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,720
just got done carrying up and we were

322
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:24,560
gonna smoke some of it for the first

323
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,560
time this sunday oh yeah

324
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,519
absolutely you know what we could do

325
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:32,078
that we can arrange that

326
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:34,078
um it is really interesting i i don't

327
00:11:32,078 --> 00:11:35,120
want to say that the effect i mean i

328
00:11:34,078 --> 00:11:37,679
don't know if i've talked to you the

329
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:40,320
last last time about the effect or you

330
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:42,639
might have you haven't really

331
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:45,440
the main the main reason i was changing

332
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:48,000
or chasing that uh sinai was for that

333
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,440
granule terpene um i was looking through

334
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,440
different cultivars that were high in

335
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,440
the granule and sinai popped up and then

336
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,760
i saw that you had it i was like well

337
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,600
hell we're gonna hunt these

338
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:59,278
yeah did you get any

339
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,839
uh

340
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:05,919
i did not get them tested i test with my

341
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:06,720
nose because i am a home hoppy road

342
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:08,000
but

343
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,639
i can say

344
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,519
they all had a very very

345
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:16,799
granule smell to them they had heavy

346
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:19,919
heavy floral rose scents

347
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:21,838
it was fairly inbred most of them

348
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:24,319
some of them had like a musky skunky

349
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:26,480
spiciness to them but they're

350
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,760
they all seem to carry that floral scent

351
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,399
there was one

352
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:33,120
that really really stuck out to me and i

353
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:36,078
did a small pollination on that one and

354
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:38,879
it definitely carried what i would say

355
00:12:36,078 --> 00:12:40,879
was a peach essence and that's why i was

356
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:42,799
stoked to not only keep those seeds

357
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:45,439
around go through them but go through

358
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:47,199
those uh p trek crosses that you sent me

359
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,600
with the sinai

360
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:52,160
oh yeah you're gonna like those um

361
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:54,240
speaking on the feedback real quick

362
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:56,799
those are probably the speeches

363
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,959
you know uh of the market right now if

364
00:12:56,799 --> 00:13:00,799
you anybody goes out and drafts like any

365
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:04,838
of the stuff or if you're into pieces

366
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:06,559
like if you can find my traveler or

367
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:08,240
um the virus

368
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:09,679
i don't want to say i have one more

369
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,360
somewhere but

370
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:13,439
um it's probably the most unique feature

371
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:16,240
if i've ever worked with like nothing

372
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,440
else it's all coming off of that

373
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,799
that's awesome

374
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:24,480
it's really great and the cyanide that's

375
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:26,799
exactly how i would describe the turkey

376
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,399
if you were to ask me what it smells

377
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:31,519
like a musky

378
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:33,679
rose or like floral and then some i've

379
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:36,720
had people say mango

380
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:38,719
you you found one that said uh

381
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,800
what did you say it was peach

382
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,879
um so i could totally see that i've

383
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:45,519
actually seen some of the hybrids that

384
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:47,278
i've made with it um those turkeys come

385
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:48,480
out even more

386
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:50,958
it's definitely

387
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:53,039
reminiscent of stone fruit

388
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:54,638
we can we can sum it up to that like the

389
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:56,879
apricot mango

390
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:59,839
peach like stone fruit you know yeah

391
00:13:56,879 --> 00:14:00,799
totally apricot just like that yeah

392
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,720
and so

393
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:05,198
what i was speaking on that is like how

394
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,560
unique they are you go from one location

395
00:14:05,198 --> 00:14:08,479
to the next

396
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:10,799
you know it's totally different you know

397
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,959
the pakistani that i have

398
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:16,719
is

399
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:17,518
very like i want to say burning tires

400
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,160
and

401
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:21,039
earthy burning tires

402
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:22,078
um

403
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:23,439
very

404
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:25,278
much for like

405
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,639
development you know it's like before

406
00:14:25,278 --> 00:14:28,078
getting shown

407
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,159
um

408
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:31,039
so all of these are like different tools

409
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:33,278
that

410
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:34,879
people can use and access and that was

411
00:14:33,278 --> 00:14:38,799
one of the reasons that

412
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:40,879
we put our feed our land right back um

413
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:42,879
at 24 past

414
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:44,559
24 seats per pass so you get enough

415
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:46,720
playlists because you'll find some you

416
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:49,039
might find some autoflowers in there and

417
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:51,680
that that can that diverges into the way

418
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:54,559
that we do the breeding you know

419
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:56,638
um i'm not doing any sort of inbreeding

420
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:57,679
where we're selecting one male and one

421
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,839
female

422
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:02,958
i'm leaving the population

423
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:06,399
uh very open so that you you can

424
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:08,879
see what the what they were working with

425
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:10,480
over you know in the field

426
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:13,120
and

427
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,320
you'll have all that genetic

428
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,399
uh

429
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,079
information to be able to like pull from

430
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:20,159
you know

431
00:15:18,078 --> 00:15:22,000
you'll find some that might have an auto

432
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:23,360
flower crate you'll find some that might

433
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,720
be stretchier

434
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:30,159
might be more vigorous or less leafy

435
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:32,560
leaf italic ratio you know so

436
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:35,039
we we tried to leave everything in there

437
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:37,198
so you know obviously we pulled anything

438
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:38,559
out that had undesirable trades like

439
00:15:37,198 --> 00:15:41,519
from effort

440
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:43,359
but you can only do so much you know

441
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:45,360
when we're talking about throwing

442
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,879
something and this is another thing that

443
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,519
i've noticed we're talking about

444
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:52,399
something that grows where they're

445
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:54,159
putting very little into the ground

446
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:56,639
and you take it you give it everything

447
00:15:54,159 --> 00:16:00,000
it needs or everything we think it

448
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:02,159
and it's way too much for it so yeah um

449
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,159
it is one of those things where

450
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:07,600
uh you do have to spread lightly you

451
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:09,679
can't treat it like a modern cultivar

452
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,600
a bunch of food into it but

453
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:15,278
i haven't seen people do it

454
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:16,879
so you know we are trying to remove

455
00:16:15,278 --> 00:16:19,919
problematic

456
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:20,799
genotype you know type

457
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:23,519
you know

458
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:25,758
when they arrive but

459
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:28,078
you know we can only do so much so if

460
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:29,600
you do have to you know

461
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:31,838
i would say like with a grain of salt

462
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:34,399
kind of where you don't definitely don't

463
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:36,639
need to use as much food as

464
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:38,159
you would

465
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:40,320
well that's one of the things about

466
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:42,319
replicating the environments of these

467
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,278
heirlooms is

468
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,600
you're

469
00:16:43,278 --> 00:16:48,078
trying to replicate in a way their

470
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:51,440
environment because you can't treat them

471
00:16:48,078 --> 00:16:53,039
like modern polyhybrids right

472
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,639
some of them like it a little bit dryer

473
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:56,480
some of them like a little bit wetter

474
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:58,720
some of them don't like any nutrition

475
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,000
they're used to growing up in sandy soil

476
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,560
while others are

477
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,519
used to growing and very very nutrient

478
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:05,599
rich

479
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:08,160
yeah and i've seen this you know you can

480
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:09,759
take some of these and grow them

481
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,759
um

482
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:13,838
in different environments i've seen

483
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:17,679
people take the packaging and grow it

484
00:17:13,838 --> 00:17:19,198
alive and do actually do injury projects

485
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:21,439
with it where they've been

486
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:22,720
selecting the male and female that do

487
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,079
the best

488
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,759
for four seats

489
00:17:24,078 --> 00:17:28,960
and and

490
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:30,160
now everything that comes out of that

491
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:33,840
is really

492
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,840
great climatized

493
00:17:36,558 --> 00:17:40,879
so it's really interesting there's lots

494
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,240
of work that people can do it's you know

495
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,720
the main thing is that we were just

496
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,880
trying to make access

497
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,880
i'm not trying to

498
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:52,160
lay claim to any of these

499
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:54,480
um heirloom land races uh

500
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,558
i just wanted to give people access

501
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:59,120
in north america that was our original

502
00:17:56,558 --> 00:18:01,519
idea with that let's give action let's

503
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:04,479
order a bunch of overseas

504
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:06,480
let's get them from private collectors

505
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:09,599
let's do repopulation

506
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:12,319
of that of moderate size you know 25

507
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:13,359
plus males and females

508
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:15,359
and

509
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:16,639
make them available available in north

510
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:19,119
america because

511
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,000
one of the worst things and

512
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:20,959
you know

513
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,960
uh

514
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:25,440
biggest decision

515
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,798
seed buying is that having to order from

516
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,759
overseas is

517
00:18:26,798 --> 00:18:31,918
always a drag you might lose your

518
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:32,640
you know your order to custom

519
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,160
so

520
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,080
that was the whole thing is we wanted to

521
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:39,519
eliminate that

522
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:41,439
that whole barrier that whole process

523
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:43,359
yeah give american

524
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,919
and people in north america

525
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:48,079
um access to

526
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:49,840
uh land races without having to order

527
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:52,720
from overseas and wait two or three

528
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:54,319
weeks to get them you know that that was

529
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,480
the whole idea of that you know it was

530
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:56,480
just

531
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,798
yeah we appreciate and we respect that

532
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,880
because i can tell you firsthand that

533
00:19:00,798 --> 00:19:04,879
i've had you know plenty of packages

534
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,559
that have been intercepted and you know

535
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,640
and then you don't get your seeds and

536
00:19:06,558 --> 00:19:10,720
[ __ ] there goes your mind

537
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,320
yeah and you know

538
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,240
and that's the other thing too is where

539
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:16,720
uh you have orders from overseas and

540
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:19,759
sometimes those banks will will give you

541
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:21,839
a refund or they'll resend them but they

542
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:24,558
might not be the same so

543
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:24,558
you know it's always

544
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:36,959
would you say that was a big push of

545
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:37,678
what got you into breeding

546
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,200
no

547
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:41,200
no what was it that got you into

548
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,558
breeding first what got me into breeding

549
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,360
was um

550
00:19:42,558 --> 00:19:47,759
just that there was nothing

551
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:50,719
that there wasn't a lot of stuff in

552
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:53,919
north america at the time that we were

553
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:55,919
you know growing and

554
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:58,720
what you could find was

555
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:01,120
very limited and it wasn't always very

556
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,640
good and when we did order from overseas

557
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:03,759
you know it's always a risk like we were

558
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,200
just saying so

559
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:07,359
the reason that we started breeding was

560
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,840
because there was just

561
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:12,639
not very good access to that so

562
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:14,240
our idea was to just start breeding on

563
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,080
our own for us

564
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,359
and that's what we did for several years

565
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:18,960
actually

566
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:21,119
you know we started growing i started

567
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,120
growing in 2008.

568
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:26,158
we didn't start breeding

569
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:27,599
um until 2011 i actually was working

570
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:31,679
with a partner

571
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:33,599
um i met him in about 2010.

572
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:36,640
we started breeding we were growing

573
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:38,879
together we started breeding in 2011

574
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,880
and

575
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:43,760
the reason we started breeding was just

576
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,960
to make our own because we were just

577
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:46,960
satisfied with everything

578
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:52,479
so that was kind of the push the idea to

579
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,798
start preserving stuff came later you

580
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,558
know after we had decided like

581
00:20:54,798 --> 00:20:58,319
let's incorporate

582
00:20:56,558 --> 00:21:00,158
um

583
00:20:58,319 --> 00:21:02,720
like incorporate some land races into

584
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:02,720
our stuff let's

585
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,798
so that's when we started to

586
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:11,359
order stuff

587
00:21:08,798 --> 00:21:12,798
you know from overseas italy you know

588
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:13,839
collectors from

589
00:21:12,798 --> 00:21:16,480
india

590
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:17,359
uh wherever we can find collectors who

591
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,319
were

592
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:20,399
you know

593
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:21,918
able to travel at that at the time it's

594
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,000
hard to think back you know people were

595
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:25,360
able to travel after we've been shut for

596
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,880
a whole year but

597
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:28,479
um

598
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:31,280
we would get them from collectors from

599
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,279
different areas

600
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:40,960
so

601
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:43,440
before all of this

602
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,840
you were still in colorado when you

603
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,720
began growing for the first time

604
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:49,439
yes

605
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,640
awesome you're a lifetime

606
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,038
yeah

607
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,400
yeah i um

608
00:21:53,038 --> 00:21:57,679
oregon is

609
00:21:54,400 --> 00:22:00,159
another state that we associate with we

610
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:01,120
heavily

611
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:03,120
and

612
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:06,719
actually you'll you're gonna see us pop

613
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:06,719
up there a lot more in 2021

614
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:11,359
but um i do have growing experience in

615
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:12,480
southern oregon where we're growing

616
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:14,558
outside

617
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,640
in 200 gallon pot

618
00:22:14,558 --> 00:22:18,558
you know the climate there is very

619
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:21,280
different people think of oregon as

620
00:22:18,558 --> 00:22:23,038
being like rainy and

621
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:26,480
humid all the time while we're at

622
00:22:23,038 --> 00:22:26,480
southern oregon dry

623
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:42,000
[Music]

624
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:44,319
direct opposite of seattle

625
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,038
sage brushing cactuses

626
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:50,000
really okay yeah yeah so

627
00:22:47,038 --> 00:22:52,720
you know um we've i've got a few

628
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,038
little like experience drawing in a

629
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,880
region um

630
00:22:55,038 --> 00:22:58,879
obviously you know when you're inside

631
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,480
you control your requirements

632
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:03,200
um much easier

633
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,640
uh but even even depending on where

634
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,240
you're at you know you're gonna be

635
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,520
different there's gonna be different

636
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,839
pressures that you have when you're

637
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:12,480
setting up a new environment

638
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:15,439
so you know just

639
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:19,038
um yeah we've got multi-state

640
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:19,038
experience but um

641
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:24,960
and you know it's continually expanding

642
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,400
as legalization

643
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,558
going

644
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:31,280
very awesome very awesome what would you

645
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:34,079
say is the number one strain that you

646
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:35,599
sell out of the fastest

647
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:37,678
the number one

648
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:39,199
you know um

649
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:41,440
i wouldn't i wouldn't say i have a

650
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,679
number one train that fell down the

651
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:45,038
fastest but i do have some stuff that

652
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:47,278
seems to

653
00:23:45,038 --> 00:23:49,200
really hit it it all seems to be

654
00:23:47,278 --> 00:23:50,400
whatever the flavor is that year you

655
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,038
know

656
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,960
banana seems to be really popular right

657
00:23:53,038 --> 00:23:57,278
now we got a lot of people picking up

658
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:59,600
the raspberry banana

659
00:23:57,278 --> 00:24:01,759
you know an all-time favorite

660
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:04,079
typically

661
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:06,240
that everybody unanimously seemed to

662
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:08,158
like coffee

663
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,240
um

664
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:12,720
so we did a little bit of work with

665
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,720
coffee

666
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:17,119
i would just say it really depends on

667
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:20,319
whatever is possible because i've made

668
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:22,879
some great trains about four years ago

669
00:24:20,319 --> 00:24:24,079
and you know i put them on the menu

670
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,679
and uh

671
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:27,439
they're really great

672
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:28,480
you know they weren't popular two years

673
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,240
ago but

674
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,400
for some reason people are scooping them

675
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:34,240
up really quick this year so it just

676
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,159
seems like whatever flavor people are

677
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,599
into because you know i'm trying to

678
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:40,480
breed you know

679
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:43,439
not just what i like you know also some

680
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:45,599
stuff in there that i don't necessarily

681
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,038
like to smoke you know there's a lot of

682
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:48,879
other people like to smoke you know

683
00:24:47,038 --> 00:24:51,119
something like stuff

684
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:55,200
which is a serpent that i'm not

685
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:57,759
super fond of like jelly bean candy yeah

686
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:59,360
tangerine flavor

687
00:24:57,759 --> 00:25:01,919
i'm not really fond of it but it's

688
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:03,759
really really popular for other people

689
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:06,559
so absolutely

690
00:25:03,759 --> 00:25:08,558
i make feed for people so i gotta make

691
00:25:06,558 --> 00:25:10,879
what they like

692
00:25:08,558 --> 00:25:13,038
so one of the strains that really

693
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,640
brought sun leaf seed company to my

694
00:25:13,038 --> 00:25:17,839
attention that i heard a ton of people

695
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:20,080
raving about was the unleaded

696
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:22,158
what's what's that all about

697
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:24,879
so i'm ready to straight it's a ice

698
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:27,760
cream cake across from our blacktop and

699
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:29,679
the blacktop is the sour diesel nigerian

700
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:32,319
spread

701
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:34,798
that's why and so

702
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:36,480
yeah and that is really the

703
00:25:34,798 --> 00:25:38,400
yeah the laptop is really great the

704
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:40,079
blackpop is actually a strain that i

705
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:43,600
acquired from

706
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:46,960
other breeders in oregon who

707
00:25:43,599 --> 00:25:48,319
um they we traded it um

708
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,919
and

709
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:51,678
yeah the funny story on the blacktop

710
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:52,960
really quick is actually i went to one

711
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:55,440
of these

712
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:59,120
homegrowers up in oregon

713
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:00,798
uh dispensaries were there uh

714
00:25:59,119 --> 00:26:03,359
homegrowers were there everybody was

715
00:26:00,798 --> 00:26:04,639
there so handing out flowers to each

716
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:07,359
other

717
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:10,400
um basically like this was somebody gave

718
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:12,240
me a couple buzz of this and it had 10

719
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,919
15 seeds in it

720
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:16,240
and um

721
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:17,600
it was the best flower that i

722
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:21,359
like out of

723
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:22,319
everything and it was black and red

724
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:24,240
and the guy

725
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:25,839
the guy was like oh we're calling it we

726
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:28,558
call it blacktop

727
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:29,599
and uh because it's like apple

728
00:26:28,558 --> 00:26:30,480
and

729
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:33,278
um

730
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,400
you know it had been bred for several

731
00:26:33,278 --> 00:26:38,558
seasons

732
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:40,640
with the selection being for sour flavor

733
00:26:38,558 --> 00:26:42,798
with the nigerian buzz

734
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:47,038
nice that's beautiful

735
00:26:42,798 --> 00:26:47,038
and a very cool head effect like um

736
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:50,239
and so

737
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:53,038
we grew it out and

738
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:55,599
we continued to work with it and

739
00:26:53,038 --> 00:26:58,400
everything that it touches seems to bump

740
00:26:55,599 --> 00:27:00,158
up the resin head size bump up the yield

741
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,720
from top to bottom

742
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:06,720
uh it adds a sour flavor

743
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:09,839
and it'll add that uplifting sativa

744
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:12,720
so it's kind of overpowered stuff but it

745
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:13,678
leaves at least really good traits of

746
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,798
the mom

747
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:16,320
so

748
00:27:14,798 --> 00:27:18,639
um and

749
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:21,038
like like i said it bumps up the yield

750
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:24,240
so when we got back to the ice cream

751
00:27:21,038 --> 00:27:25,200
cake it was just putting out stuff that

752
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,640
was like

753
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,319
coke bottles

754
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,640
and

755
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:31,678
i handed out a few of them to a few

756
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,480
people

757
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:34,080
and

758
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,278
some people got some good pictures of

759
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:36,879
them but

760
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:38,319
uh

761
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,760
that's the main thing is like that's

762
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:41,038
going around i think that's going to be

763
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:42,079
a big one once

764
00:27:41,038 --> 00:27:45,119
more people

765
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:48,000
get to see it uh fill the soils doing a

766
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:49,199
whole two by two tent with one plant in

767
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,200
it

768
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,038
and i wish him

769
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,558
all the luck but i hope it doesn't step

770
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:57,119
too much because that

771
00:27:54,558 --> 00:27:59,200
that thing is gonna yield a lot i really

772
00:27:57,119 --> 00:28:03,038
you know he he actually messaged me and

773
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:03,038
told me he killed it more than he's

774
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:09,479
we're going to take a quick break we'll

775
00:28:04,798 --> 00:28:09,480
be right back with sun leaf seat company

776
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:12,900
[Music]

777
00:28:38,558 --> 00:28:43,200
all right we are back with sun leaf seat

778
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,480
company before we left we were talking

779
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,399
about some of his methods with

780
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,919
repopulating these land races some of

781
00:28:46,398 --> 00:28:50,158
the cultivars that he works with not

782
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:52,720
only is he doing preservation efforts

783
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:54,880
but he's working on true hybrids and

784
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:56,558
he's working on poly hybrids as well

785
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:58,799
he's also

786
00:28:56,558 --> 00:29:00,158
doing a lot of fem work now and we're

787
00:28:58,798 --> 00:29:03,440
going to jump into that we're going to

788
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:05,200
be talking about how he feminizes seeds

789
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:07,679
what he's been working on what's to come

790
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:10,558
with suddenly seed company but first

791
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:12,798
we went through and we dug out

792
00:29:10,558 --> 00:29:15,839
our peach fino of the cyanide i've been

793
00:29:12,798 --> 00:29:17,119
saying that wrong forever sinai cyanide

794
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:18,798
cyanide

795
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:20,239
i need to nail that in my head but we

796
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:21,599
found the peach pheno i've got some

797
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:24,000
loaded up and we're going to do a live

798
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:24,000
review

799
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:28,398
cheers i hope it's good

800
00:29:30,798 --> 00:29:34,240
right so all right well i'll talk about

801
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:37,200
the effects real quick you're going to

802
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:39,120
go through a portal

803
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:42,399
no the effect is very similar from what

804
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:44,239
i've reviewed um to

805
00:29:42,398 --> 00:29:46,079
similar to like headbands almost where

806
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:48,798
you'll feel it kind of in your forehead

807
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:52,158
almost like your third eye really really

808
00:29:48,798 --> 00:29:54,398
really weird that is wonderful

809
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:56,000
that is wonderful you know the the

810
00:29:54,398 --> 00:29:58,798
flavor isn't

811
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,640
overwhelming but it's not

812
00:29:58,798 --> 00:30:02,480
it's not watered down it's not there

813
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,399
it's just a very very

814
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:06,399
it it's not an offensive one so it

815
00:30:04,398 --> 00:30:08,398
doesn't stick out you know

816
00:30:06,398 --> 00:30:11,359
but it's very very clean

817
00:30:08,398 --> 00:30:14,639
very even and it it just it's just a

818
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:16,639
fresh clean flavor really

819
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:19,520
yeah you know and that's one of the

820
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:20,799
things like some of us younger people

821
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:23,599
um

822
00:30:20,798 --> 00:30:26,398
that's nice that's beautiful

823
00:30:23,599 --> 00:30:28,719
the major prohibition you know um

824
00:30:26,398 --> 00:30:29,519
we're so spoiled you know

825
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,278
uh

826
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:33,839
wow you can smoke some of these land

827
00:30:31,278 --> 00:30:35,519
races to where they

828
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:37,678
you know they kind of taste like grass

829
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:38,398
and it's always disappointing to grow it

830
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:40,559
for

831
00:30:38,398 --> 00:30:42,158
eight or nine weeks and then i love it

832
00:30:40,558 --> 00:30:44,398
however long

833
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:46,000
you know so yeah that that one is really

834
00:30:44,398 --> 00:30:47,759
that's a really good one i try and work

835
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,880
with ones that are going to be

836
00:30:47,759 --> 00:30:50,000
that you're going to want to work with

837
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,360
you

838
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,359
you can tell it's something that's not

839
00:30:51,359 --> 00:30:56,079
going to knock you out

840
00:30:53,359 --> 00:30:59,038
but yeah flavor we'll see effect in a

841
00:30:56,079 --> 00:31:02,319
little bit but flavor right off the bat

842
00:30:59,038 --> 00:31:04,158
clean burn beautiful smooth

843
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:05,278
i would say that floral really came

844
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:07,679
through and that's kind of what's

845
00:31:05,278 --> 00:31:10,960
leaning into that clean taste

846
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:13,600
is kind of that floral essence to it and

847
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:14,880
that's one that'll get lightened

848
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:17,119
too

849
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,159
you can taste it after a couple minutes

850
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:20,158
ago

851
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:22,320
yeah yeah it's not getting super hashy

852
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:24,159
it's not overload with resin to be able

853
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:26,079
to get too ashy

854
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:28,320
yeah

855
00:31:26,079 --> 00:31:29,839
yeah that's a good one it's really great

856
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:32,879
hybrids actually

857
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:32,879
so i'm excited that you made

858
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:39,119
i actually i did the open pollination of

859
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:40,480
the phenotypes that i liked the most and

860
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:42,398
you know what i was seeing in that

861
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:44,480
cyanide population

862
00:31:42,398 --> 00:31:47,038
it is very inbred there's not a lot of

863
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:49,038
variation but there was some that were

864
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:51,038
taller with longer internal spacing and

865
00:31:49,038 --> 00:31:53,278
then there was some that were really

866
00:31:51,038 --> 00:31:55,200
like you said it was a pretty rare

867
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:57,119
phenotype but there was some more uh

868
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,880
broadly dominant plants that stayed

869
00:31:57,119 --> 00:32:00,398
shorter in structure

870
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,640
and there was one

871
00:32:00,398 --> 00:32:04,239
select female that peach one that was

872
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:06,480
that broad leaf dominant which is what i

873
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:09,359
was going after at first it expressed

874
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:12,079
very very dark colors um even the male

875
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:12,959
expressed really dark colors in a sex

876
00:32:12,079 --> 00:32:14,879
but

877
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:16,880
that female

878
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:20,320
especially amongst the land race

879
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:21,840
population it was frosty as hell and not

880
00:32:20,319 --> 00:32:23,759
only that but it was putting off that

881
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:25,359
peach flavor and i was just like you're

882
00:32:23,759 --> 00:32:26,798
you're the one like it's just that

883
00:32:25,359 --> 00:32:29,519
obvious you know

884
00:32:26,798 --> 00:32:32,158
um so i hit the mail with her and i kept

885
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:34,159
a couple other females and hit them as

886
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:35,919
well but i mainly wanted to select from

887
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:38,480
that one plant and see what we can get

888
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:40,159
out of that and then i was going to take

889
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,919
those um

890
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:44,240
probably make another selection and then

891
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:46,000
out cross from there but last time i

892
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:48,159
talked to you you said it actually took

893
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,480
a couple out crossings before you

894
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:53,120
started reaching what's considered a

895
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:55,200
more modernly acceptable uh plant

896
00:32:53,119 --> 00:32:57,119
structure

897
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,240
yeah yeah

898
00:32:57,119 --> 00:33:00,319
um

899
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:02,319
you've probably experienced that

900
00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:04,319
some of these land raised um

901
00:33:02,319 --> 00:33:06,319
flower density isn't going to be the

902
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:07,599
same as we're used to with the modern

903
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:09,038
culture

904
00:33:07,599 --> 00:33:11,278
and so

905
00:33:09,038 --> 00:33:13,440
you might find that you do need to take

906
00:33:11,278 --> 00:33:16,960
it a few generations

907
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:20,320
with a modern cultivar or using a very

908
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:22,000
aggressive selection or dense flowers if

909
00:33:20,319 --> 00:33:23,439
that's what you're looking for

910
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,079
but

911
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:28,320
that's the least of my concern

912
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:30,319
sure and some people are concerned about

913
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:32,398
that the main thing i think that this is

914
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:33,599
great greatly used for

915
00:33:32,398 --> 00:33:34,798
is

916
00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:36,079
um

917
00:33:34,798 --> 00:33:38,240
the turkey

918
00:33:36,079 --> 00:33:38,240
yeah

919
00:33:51,599 --> 00:33:57,519
i crossed it through my half alien and

920
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:59,599
it put up massive nuts like

921
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:03,278
two liter bottles almost

922
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:04,879
but they take like 13 weeks to finish

923
00:34:03,278 --> 00:34:08,800
and

924
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:10,079
it it's unbelievable how big it uh you

925
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,679
wouldn't know

926
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:14,399
and this is like one of these recessive

927
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:16,398
facebooks like you don't see

928
00:34:14,398 --> 00:34:18,480
these kind of phenotypes and genotypes

929
00:34:16,398 --> 00:34:20,878
within either one of those populations

930
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,878
until

931
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:32,159
i can tell you already i'm already

932
00:34:29,838 --> 00:34:34,878
feeling the effects of it which is

933
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:37,039
actually a little surprising but um yeah

934
00:34:34,878 --> 00:34:39,358
well you know it is it is

935
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:40,878
so it is selected as a drug cultivar

936
00:34:39,358 --> 00:34:42,960
that's what you would that's what it

937
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:43,918
would be considered like in the middle

938
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:47,199
east

939
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:48,559
uh as a drug cultivar and

940
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:51,039
um

941
00:34:48,559 --> 00:34:53,440
some of the tests actually are over you

942
00:34:51,039 --> 00:34:55,599
know 16 19

943
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,800
wow and those tests were actually done

944
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:59,838
in oregon

945
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:00,640
uh in southern oregon on a farm

946
00:34:59,838 --> 00:35:01,679
that

947
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:04,078
we were

948
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:05,279
not working on but we were working with

949
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:07,680
the farmer

950
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:09,760
um and that was the same

951
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:11,759
all the same feedstock and

952
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:13,200
everything that

953
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:15,680
we had

954
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:17,199
worked with so it's all really accurate

955
00:35:15,679 --> 00:35:19,759
information

956
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:22,879
so that that's all that generations of

957
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:25,760
farm work you know on location before it

958
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:27,599
was even handed to you or who was it red

959
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:29,680
scare before you

960
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:31,200
no it was a real

961
00:35:29,679 --> 00:35:32,719
real seed company you're right you're

962
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:35,118
right um

963
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:36,719
i'm already feeling in my arms my arms

964
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:39,119
feel very very

965
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:40,799
that almost that tingly feeling

966
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:42,960
you can definitely feel it in my head

967
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:45,200
like you said almost like a headband

968
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:47,358
but it's hitting me more like a

969
00:35:45,199 --> 00:35:49,118
one-to-one where it's very very easy and

970
00:35:47,358 --> 00:35:50,159
very comfortable it's not overwhelming

971
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:53,280
at all

972
00:35:50,159 --> 00:35:54,319
it's beautiful beautiful work

973
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:58,960
you know

974
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:58,960
i wouldn't say take all my face but you

975
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:11,960
it might contain some other cannabinoids

976
00:36:21,039 --> 00:36:24,239
that's actually pretty common amongst

977
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:27,118
land races

978
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:29,598
yeah yeah i mean when we did the testing

979
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:31,440
um when the testing got done that we did

980
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:34,000
the testing when the testing got done i

981
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:37,280
think it was 2016. so there's been a

982
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,280
whole load of uh

983
00:36:37,358 --> 00:36:41,920
discovered

984
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:44,320
absolutely absolutely that's pretty

985
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:45,280
amazing especially when we came from you

986
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,039
know

987
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:49,839
thc and cbd

988
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:51,039
and now you got cbg and you've got you

989
00:36:49,838 --> 00:36:54,639
know

990
00:36:51,039 --> 00:36:57,279
even thca and cbda we're going what oh

991
00:36:54,639 --> 00:37:00,078
that's why you got to heat it up got it

992
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:01,599
yeah and how long it was where we were

993
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:03,119
we didn't know

994
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:05,599
we didn't know

995
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:08,800
yeah that's a that's a topic that we

996
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:11,119
just need to put a whole episode on um

997
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:13,039
thcv awesoming all these different

998
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:14,640
things and you're going what there's so

999
00:37:13,039 --> 00:37:16,719
many yeah and i really like watching

1000
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:18,960
your live video on instagram where you

1001
00:37:16,719 --> 00:37:20,480
guys were just like every every episode

1002
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:23,039
you guys are going over like different

1003
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,039
type of third

1004
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:33,039
thanks man i really appreciate that that

1005
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:34,400
means a lot coming from you yeah

1006
00:37:33,039 --> 00:37:36,719
so

1007
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:39,760
before we get too off subject

1008
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:41,199
i we want to go over like what sun

1009
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:43,440
leaf's doing now what are you doing with

1010
00:37:41,199 --> 00:37:45,598
your company now what's the future of

1011
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:47,679
sunless seed company you're i'm saying

1012
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:50,000
you're doing a lot more feminized work

1013
00:37:47,679 --> 00:37:52,000
yeah yeah so right now

1014
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:55,358
we're not we're still going to continue

1015
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:57,119
the land race work and preservation now

1016
00:37:55,358 --> 00:37:58,078
that's definitely that's never going out

1017
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:02,160
for us

1018
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:03,599
but we are doing a lot of feminized work

1019
00:38:02,159 --> 00:38:05,920
and um

1020
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:07,760
with modern parts for the main main

1021
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:09,680
portion of the

1022
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,640
work that we're starting right now

1023
00:38:09,679 --> 00:38:13,358
so

1024
00:38:10,639 --> 00:38:14,960
out of these feminized genetics that

1025
00:38:13,358 --> 00:38:16,078
you're starting to work with what are

1026
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:18,880
you putting out there what are you

1027
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:21,200
excited about what's in what do people

1028
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,559
have to expect in the future coming from

1029
00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:24,879
sun so

1030
00:38:22,559 --> 00:38:26,239
the main thing that we were

1031
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:29,280
you know

1032
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:31,039
the main thing with the feminize is that

1033
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,560
you know people find it really

1034
00:38:31,039 --> 00:38:34,079
convenient it's kind of where the

1035
00:38:32,559 --> 00:38:37,039
market's heading

1036
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:37,039
but as a breeder

1037
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,599
you can

1038
00:38:38,559 --> 00:38:41,358
really

1039
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:44,079
dial in

1040
00:38:41,358 --> 00:38:46,559
what's happening what where your body is

1041
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:48,640
going with the line and

1042
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:50,799
this is something that you can't you can

1043
00:38:48,639 --> 00:38:52,960
do with the mail when you're

1044
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:54,960
when you do rigorous you know

1045
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:56,400
not that we're not doing testing but

1046
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:58,800
when you can really see what the

1047
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:03,200
phenotype and the denote you know assume

1048
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:05,039
the genotype of the females um

1049
00:39:03,199 --> 00:39:07,439
you don't have to deal with something

1050
00:39:05,039 --> 00:39:08,880
that's unknown so you kind of have a

1051
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:10,800
little more

1052
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:13,119
a guided breeding

1053
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:16,720
feminist tree

1054
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:18,320
so look for 121 and 20.2 we're going to

1055
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:21,519
be doing pretty much

1056
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:24,559
only working with all

1057
00:39:21,519 --> 00:39:26,639
breeding techniques

1058
00:39:24,559 --> 00:39:29,838
all feminized by

1059
00:39:26,639 --> 00:39:30,719
to really uh give people

1060
00:39:29,838 --> 00:39:31,599
uh

1061
00:39:30,719 --> 00:39:34,559
more

1062
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:36,640
options for feminist feed but also to

1063
00:39:34,559 --> 00:39:37,838
try and win more people over towards the

1064
00:39:36,639 --> 00:39:38,960
feminist

1065
00:39:37,838 --> 00:39:40,719
because

1066
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:43,280
there's a huge misconception that

1067
00:39:40,719 --> 00:39:43,279
feminist

1068
00:39:54,719 --> 00:39:57,199
i haven't

1069
00:40:06,318 --> 00:40:09,759
has been really great so

1070
00:40:08,159 --> 00:40:12,480
the technique

1071
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:14,079
have really uh come a long way from what

1072
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,920
we were using

1073
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:17,599
even two years ago

1074
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,720
so

1075
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:20,720
you know

1076
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:22,078
the idea is to really get people on

1077
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:24,639
board with them

1078
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:26,560
this is where the market's going and not

1079
00:40:24,639 --> 00:40:28,879
that we're going to stop making regulars

1080
00:40:26,559 --> 00:40:31,039
but when you can eliminate uh

1081
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:32,160
variables you know when you want to

1082
00:40:31,039 --> 00:40:34,719
directly

1083
00:40:32,159 --> 00:40:36,399
uh stabilize the line or make something

1084
00:40:34,719 --> 00:40:39,199
that isn't going to have a bunch of

1085
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:41,039
diversity or variation

1086
00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:44,480
without doing

1087
00:40:41,039 --> 00:40:46,960
years and years of inbreeding and work

1088
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:49,199
you know feminize this way

1089
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:51,760
there's absolutely a place for feminized

1090
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:54,000
seeds and you know my first argument

1091
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:55,520
would be these states that have plant

1092
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,599
count limits and people don't want to

1093
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:58,960
get in any trouble it's nice to know

1094
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:00,960
that they're going to have what they

1095
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:02,960
want coming out of that seat or at least

1096
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:04,318
as long as it's from a reputable breeder

1097
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,240
you know

1098
00:41:04,318 --> 00:41:09,838
not only that if you have no interest in

1099
00:41:06,239 --> 00:41:11,759
breeding at all um feminize might just

1100
00:41:09,838 --> 00:41:13,838
be for you you know

1101
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:16,160
yeah and a lot of people you know

1102
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:18,239
you know some people don't think about

1103
00:41:16,159 --> 00:41:20,318
other people being limited on faith you

1104
00:41:18,239 --> 00:41:22,318
know even me sometimes i think that the

1105
00:41:20,318 --> 00:41:24,559
idea that someone might be limited on

1106
00:41:22,318 --> 00:41:26,000
space for granted so

1107
00:41:24,559 --> 00:41:27,679
being able to

1108
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,159
top three fees and know that they're

1109
00:41:27,679 --> 00:41:33,598
going to get three females is is much

1110
00:41:30,159 --> 00:41:35,039
better for them than popping

1111
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:36,800
and they don't know if they're gonna get

1112
00:41:35,039 --> 00:41:38,559
three females they don't know if they're

1113
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:40,160
gonna get two and they don't know if

1114
00:41:38,559 --> 00:41:42,480
they're gonna get sick

1115
00:41:40,159 --> 00:41:44,239
they don't know if they're gonna get 12.

1116
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:46,159
i've been there

1117
00:41:44,239 --> 00:41:47,919
yeah and i have two where you you know

1118
00:41:46,159 --> 00:41:50,078
you over pop thinking that you're going

1119
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:52,800
to get mail and then you get all females

1120
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:52,800
and you go oh no

1121
00:41:53,039 --> 00:41:57,920
that's an awesome problem

1122
00:41:55,358 --> 00:42:00,239
i can't say i've ever had that

1123
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:03,838
so the idea is to be able to you need to

1124
00:42:00,239 --> 00:42:03,838
go to vegas and gamble right now

1125
00:42:04,719 --> 00:42:09,279
um

1126
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:11,598
the idea is to be able to get people

1127
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:13,760
more accustomed to

1128
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:15,519
be comfortable going to feminist

1129
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:17,680
there really

1130
00:42:15,519 --> 00:42:19,679
in if you do all the research you'll

1131
00:42:17,679 --> 00:42:21,118
find that

1132
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:23,519
the breeding

1133
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:24,880
is basically the same we're just making

1134
00:42:23,519 --> 00:42:26,239
females

1135
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:28,480
instead of

1136
00:42:26,239 --> 00:42:29,519
putting other variables

1137
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:32,079
so

1138
00:42:29,519 --> 00:42:33,519
a lot of people argue that it's

1139
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:36,560
unnatural you know you're just

1140
00:42:33,519 --> 00:42:38,400
countering nature and how can you create

1141
00:42:36,559 --> 00:42:40,559
a good product from something that's so

1142
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:43,039
unnatural to the plant

1143
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:45,358
i would i would really disagree um we

1144
00:42:43,039 --> 00:42:48,000
are using a chemical to change the

1145
00:42:45,358 --> 00:42:48,880
hormonal production of the plant

1146
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,838
um

1147
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:51,920
but

1148
00:42:49,838 --> 00:42:54,799
the actual physical

1149
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:57,358
you know pollinating it's still natural

1150
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:58,960
and the speed production is natural and

1151
00:42:57,358 --> 00:43:01,759
the chromosomes

1152
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:04,000
are all natural it's just feminine

1153
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:05,280
you know so i i really be able to do

1154
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,239
more research

1155
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:08,640
on it

1156
00:43:06,239 --> 00:43:10,399
and i think you'll find you know when

1157
00:43:08,639 --> 00:43:11,838
we're talking about humans yeah it's a

1158
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:13,920
much different thing you know but when

1159
00:43:11,838 --> 00:43:15,358
we're talking about plants they're much

1160
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:18,639
different and

1161
00:43:15,358 --> 00:43:20,000
it's actually extremely common in nature

1162
00:43:18,639 --> 00:43:21,598
well and this kind of breeding is

1163
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:24,400
extremely

1164
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:26,640
common in the agriculture

1165
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:29,200
industry and that's one thing that the

1166
00:43:26,639 --> 00:43:32,159
cannabis industry has not caught up on

1167
00:43:29,199 --> 00:43:34,879
yep so to add to that i would say that

1168
00:43:32,159 --> 00:43:36,799
i've grown quite a few femme seeds and

1169
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,440
i've never had a problem with any of

1170
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:39,760
them

1171
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:41,280
um thankfully hopefully it was good work

1172
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:43,119
maybe i got lucky

1173
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:45,760
but yeah

1174
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:48,800
but i've had not only good results with

1175
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:51,040
femmes i've never had an intersex mc

1176
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:53,119
and i have had some really really good

1177
00:43:51,039 --> 00:43:55,599
yielders i had one that was an amnesia

1178
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:57,119
hastem and i believe that was even from

1179
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:59,200
barney's farm and it did excellent it

1180
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:02,720
was like an eight ounce plant you know

1181
00:43:59,199 --> 00:44:05,358
in a in a square meter no problem

1182
00:44:02,719 --> 00:44:06,639
yeah and you know this is one of the

1183
00:44:05,358 --> 00:44:08,799
things that

1184
00:44:06,639 --> 00:44:11,759
we're doing and you can do with them and

1185
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:14,480
i see that we can really dial

1186
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:15,280
a plate that we want to lock in

1187
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:17,358
uh

1188
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:19,920
it's just easier to do because we can

1189
00:44:17,358 --> 00:44:22,559
see the female and we can see what this

1190
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:24,318
female will put into a line with this

1191
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:27,358
other female you know we reverse one on

1192
00:44:24,318 --> 00:44:29,279
the other and yeah it it has variables

1193
00:44:27,358 --> 00:44:30,480
between you know strains that you

1194
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:32,079
probably do

1195
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:33,838
but um

1196
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:34,880
it's much more reliable

1197
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:36,480
than

1198
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:38,480
to be able to

1199
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:40,639
you know see what you're doing what

1200
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:41,599
you're working with and using a mail and

1201
00:44:40,639 --> 00:44:44,078
guessing

1202
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:45,838
you know and yeah there's um testing

1203
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:47,200
that you can do now there's a lot of

1204
00:44:45,838 --> 00:44:48,159
different kinds of testing that we can

1205
00:44:47,199 --> 00:44:50,318
get done

1206
00:44:48,159 --> 00:44:52,960
that when you're talking about um the

1207
00:44:50,318 --> 00:44:55,519
male you know uh these guys throwing

1208
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:56,559
under nails and filling up selection

1209
00:44:55,519 --> 00:44:58,639
um

1210
00:44:56,559 --> 00:44:59,440
you still have variables that you can't

1211
00:44:58,639 --> 00:45:01,199
see

1212
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:02,079
in those males that when you when you

1213
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:04,399
make your

1214
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:04,400
um

1215
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:08,560
uh these variables can come out you know

1216
00:45:07,679 --> 00:45:10,000
um

1217
00:45:08,559 --> 00:45:11,039
and this is just something that we were

1218
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,719
trying to do

1219
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:15,440
we're trying to stay on

1220
00:45:12,719 --> 00:45:16,799
farm with the rest of the agriculture

1221
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:18,480
industry you know

1222
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:20,720
if you've done any research you'll see

1223
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:22,880
that there's companies already doing

1224
00:45:20,719 --> 00:45:24,559
uh tetraploid and

1225
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:26,240
triploid breeding

1226
00:45:24,559 --> 00:45:27,679
yeah i've heard about them

1227
00:45:26,239 --> 00:45:29,118
