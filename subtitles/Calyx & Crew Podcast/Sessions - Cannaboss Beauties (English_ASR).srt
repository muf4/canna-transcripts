independent Boss by the time I met you

00:02:05,938 --> 00:02:10,859
so I'm very excited I want to know a

23
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:12,839
little bit more about what you guys do I

24
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:14,459
know canacure makes Edibles actually I

25
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,959

26
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:18,300
the show that's what I should be doing

27
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:20,959
because I promised her I would I still

28
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,959
have that land

29
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:27,840
but I want to know what Queenie what is

30
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:30,660
the can of Boss Beauties tell me more

31
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:34,378
about that okay so cannonballs Beauties

32
00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:36,840
are women who are no longer in the green

33
00:02:34,378 --> 00:02:39,419
closet so they're not hiding that they

34
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:42,239
medicate they are not hiding that they

35
00:02:39,419 --> 00:02:45,119
use the plant their mothers they're not

36
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:47,580
mothers their their sisters their best

37
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,819
friends they're just women that want to

38
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:53,879
come together unite smoke medicate heal

39
00:02:50,818 --> 00:02:56,280
treat themselves and be able to do it in

40
00:02:53,878 --> 00:02:59,579
a safe positive space without judgment

41
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:01,439
and make money and turn that love of the

42
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:03,840
plant into some type of small business

43
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:06,000
because a lot of the Cannibal's Beauties

44
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,519
are disabled they suffer with chronic

45
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,340
illness so they need to make their own

46
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:14,219
um stream of income

47
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:16,560
so I couldn't be a can about you you can

48
00:03:14,219 --> 00:03:20,479
you can be a Cannibal's Beauty you know

49
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,479
because it's not limited to women die

50
00:03:21,019 --> 00:03:25,860
no no no no no no we accept everybody as

51
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:29,819
a matter of fact a part of the platform

52
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:32,760
in reality is a big um a big Spotlight

53
00:03:29,818 --> 00:03:34,560
on mental health for men so we have a

54
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:36,179
lot of men who come on to the lives and

55
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,098
they talk about their own trauma their

56
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:40,500
own relationships and I think in

57
00:03:38,098 --> 00:03:44,158
listening to all of us they're learning

58
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:45,780
so much about themselves so I think a

59
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:47,219
Cannibal's Beauty can be a male or

60
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:49,140
female because I think men are beautiful

61
00:03:47,219 --> 00:03:52,259
I don't think beauty is limited to just

62
00:03:49,139 --> 00:03:56,039
a woman so I'm down I accept everybody

63
00:03:52,259 --> 00:03:58,979
I'm inclusive not exclusive

64
00:03:56,039 --> 00:04:00,479
like yeah everybody seems to kind of

65
00:03:58,979 --> 00:04:02,518
have their Niche though so I was

66
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:04,500
wondering if that was part of it I know

67
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:06,299
you guys definitely Empower a lot of

68
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:08,759
women especially women that have small

69
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:10,379
businesses to you know blow up and kind

70
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:12,239
of expose them you all help each other

71
00:04:10,378 --> 00:04:14,340

72
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,199
Discord you all group together and

73
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:18,959
you're out to help each other you're not

74
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:20,340
there for competition you're there for

75
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,199
one purpose and that's helping each

76
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:24,539
other out constantly I want to talk to

77
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:27,240

78
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:30,199
Let's uh let's bring you up really quick

79
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,199
on the big screen

80
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,740
wait what

81
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:40,519
all right so how long have you been

82
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:40,519
making edibles

83
00:04:40,978 --> 00:04:43,819
it's like

84
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,960
I think edibles

85
00:04:55,620 --> 00:05:02,959
only a year

86
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:02,960
yeah what was the first edible you made

87
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:09,019
um just cookies regular chocolate chip

88
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:09,019
cookies

89
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:16,280
so how did we go for cookies to cake

90
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:16,280
pops nerds ropes

91
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:19,879
I like

92
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:27,538
this in the kitchen I just constantly

93
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:30,538
I'm making new things so it was always

94
00:05:27,538 --> 00:05:33,360
empties everything with DHC every well

95
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:37,139
once I started influencing after that it

96
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:39,720
was like constantive confused everything

97
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:43,620
yeah where can we fit this in that's

98
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:45,539
awesome yeah huge congrats here in a

99
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:47,639
little bit and show everybody

100
00:05:45,538 --> 00:05:49,680
not only are they awesome but they're

101
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:52,918
extremely potent way too potent for me

102
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,660
I've been growing since 0-4 and I've

103
00:05:52,918 --> 00:05:56,639
made the classic brownies and cookies

104
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:58,979
and all that [ __ ] but never in my life

105
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:01,500
have I I think the most intense thing

106
00:05:58,978 --> 00:06:03,959
I've ever seen is like a silo Simon

107
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:07,079
infused truffle like a chocolate truffle

108
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:09,478
and those are amazing but

109
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:12,240
the the [ __ ] that you do with cannabis

110
00:06:09,478 --> 00:06:15,120
is pretty damn cool

111
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:18,680
and 200 milligrams or a cake pop that'll

112
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,680
knock out a horse it won't

113
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:28,199
I have a horrible metabolism and so I

114
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:30,720
need two and so I am a frequent Shopper

115
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:33,080
of candy

116
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,080
because

117
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,459
I did try the cookies the cookies were

118
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,919
very very good

119
00:06:38,459 --> 00:06:42,599
um but I have yet to have a cake pop and

120
00:06:40,918 --> 00:06:44,639
I think I'm going to take at least I'll

121
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,860
take half of it I'll take half of it I'm

122
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:49,019
not as cool as you Mel I can't take that

123
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:51,419
many Edibles I don't know what it is

124
00:06:49,019 --> 00:06:53,038
I'll dab anybody under the table or

125
00:06:51,418 --> 00:06:56,279
smoke them out all [ __ ] day but I

126
00:06:53,038 --> 00:07:00,500
ain't about to get into an Edibles race

127
00:06:56,279 --> 00:07:00,500
I'm so excited to see this

128
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,940
I am too

129
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:08,160
so when did the Cannabis Beauties thing

130
00:07:05,939 --> 00:07:12,000
start

131
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:17,039
um I started can a Queenie combos back

132
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:19,680
in I think it was uh March of this of

133
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:23,098
2022 and then the girl started just

134
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:25,139
coming on and we couldn't figure out a

135
00:07:23,098 --> 00:07:28,019
name because at the beginning I was like

136
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:30,000
oh can a mom boss but cannabis Boston or

137
00:07:28,019 --> 00:07:31,680
whatever but I can't be like that

138
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,139
because not all the girls are moms so

139
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:37,860
I'm like okay what are we gonna do and

140
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:39,360
baby oh Olga I was on a live one day at

141
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:42,720
an event and she's like you know what

142
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:45,598
Mel cannibals Beauties and I think that

143
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,280
was like June of this year and we put

144
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:51,060
cannonballs Beauties together with the

145
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:52,379
Cali trip and it just kind of stuck and

146
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:54,899
that's what we are that's why I keep

147
00:07:52,379 --> 00:07:57,000
saying it's men and women because

148
00:07:54,899 --> 00:07:58,978
when you I I get the thought like

149
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Cannabis beauty you think women but

150
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:06,300
again we got to start including men in

151
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:09,538
in the business I Empower women but at

152
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:13,560
the same time if I shut off my mind

153
00:08:09,538 --> 00:08:15,598
to not dealing with men in some sort of

154
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:17,220
in some sort of capacity then you and I

155
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:18,060
wouldn't be having this exchange right

156
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:21,240
now

157
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:23,720
and so I had to find a balance where I

158
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,720
could still

159
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:30,060
I could still include men but make the

160
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:32,820
women feel like they had their voice and

161
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:34,379
I'm still trying to figure that out but

162
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:36,839
I think I'm I think we're on the right

163
00:08:34,379 --> 00:08:39,179
track because most of the men that come

164
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:40,880
to our lives are super respectful

165
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:44,038
they've been in the Cannabis industry

166
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:45,720
they kind of know what we're about and I

167
00:08:44,038 --> 00:08:46,679
think we've already showed people that

168
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,720
if

169
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:51,599
you know if any of the men come to our

170
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,100
lives and they're disrespectful or you

171
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,379
know they can't

172
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:57,720
um treat us the right way we kind of

173
00:08:55,379 --> 00:08:59,519
unite as a group and we stick up for one

174
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:01,500
another and we'll go to bat for one

175
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:03,419
another to make sure we're respect you

176
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:05,700

179
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:11,759

00:09:46,139 --> 00:09:52,019
physically having a conversation with

195
00:09:48,778 --> 00:09:54,778

196
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:57,179

00:12:15,299 --> 00:12:18,078

I will say while you're warming up your

247
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:38,160
Banger there

248
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:40,200
that

249
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:43,259
uh can cure

250
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:46,200
played an essential role in some of the

251
00:12:43,259 --> 00:12:50,039
changes that I made and a lot of it had

252
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:52,079
to do with the fact that her and I we

253
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:55,019
um connect on a level of having 80 you

254
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:57,899
know being women with ADHD and I think

255
00:12:55,019 --> 00:12:59,220
that this trip was the first time that I

256
00:12:57,899 --> 00:13:01,019
was in a position

257
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:02,879
where I was constantly being

258
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:06,240
overstimulated

259
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:07,919
I wasn't sleeping you know the strain

260
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,440
after strain after strain after strings

261
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:12,599
I was kind of like up and down and I

262
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:14,240
remember at one point Canada cure had a

263
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,200
we had like a deep talk

264
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,940
and

265
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:20,940
and a lot of it had to do with the fact

266
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:23,399
that I finally found someone at 44 who

267
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:25,440
could understand my ADHD and not make me

268
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:28,259
feel bad about myself

269
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:30,120
so out of the whole trip I probably took

270
00:13:28,259 --> 00:13:32,519
the conversation that her and I had

271
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:34,259
together in her car that was probably

272
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:36,299
one of my favorite moments out of the

273
00:13:34,259 --> 00:13:39,559
whole trip

274
00:13:36,299 --> 00:13:42,899
you know what I mean because it was like

275
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:44,578
I finally felt understood and accepted

276
00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:49,100
for exactly who

277
00:13:44,578 --> 00:13:49,099
I am at such an older age too

278
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,700
cheers

279
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,720
[Music]

280
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,720
no

281
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:19,199
like you said in the Discord doc we died

282
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:22,379
with each other here

283
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:25,940
we we don't mute when we dab I'm Discord

284
00:14:22,379 --> 00:14:25,939
right we just die together

285
00:14:30,149 --> 00:14:38,399
[Laughter]

286
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:42,740
the Discord is like

287
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:42,740
so I've been doing this [ __ ]

288
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:50,899
on IG and like 14 or 15 somewhere in

289
00:14:49,078 --> 00:14:54,539
there

290
00:14:50,899 --> 00:14:57,179
excuse me and back then uh it was me and

291
00:14:54,539 --> 00:14:58,559
my ex and we'd just sit on a couch we'd

292
00:14:57,179 --> 00:15:00,539
have my phone right in front of us and

293
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:02,399
we'd just smoke weed and talk to whoever

294
00:15:00,539 --> 00:15:04,139
popped in there wasn't a point

295
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,980
we were just getting high with random

296
00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:07,919
people

297
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:09,180
yeah and uh it eventually turned into

298
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:11,639
like

299
00:15:09,179 --> 00:15:13,379
people that I knew coming into lives

300
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:16,379
with us and we just talk about [ __ ] that

301
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:18,480
we learned about cannabis and uh people

302
00:15:16,379 --> 00:15:20,759
started watching it and realizing you

303
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:23,039
know who I was what groups I ran with

304
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:25,319
and [ __ ] like that and it just kind of

305
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:26,639
naturally evolved and it got to a point

306
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:28,920
where

307
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:31,198
I never felt I never had enough

308
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:33,559
confidence in myself

309
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:37,139
to think that I can be a business owner

310
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:39,000
I uh I grew up in you know Orchards and

311
00:15:37,139 --> 00:15:40,740
[ __ ] I was a farmer my entire [ __ ]

312
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,778
life so

313
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:45,060
um for anybody that's

314
00:15:42,778 --> 00:15:46,919
in that lifestyle it's kind of like this

315
00:15:45,059 --> 00:15:48,958
is the rest of your life

316
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:50,578
Farms get handed down generation to

317
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:52,259
generation that's what you're gonna do

318
00:15:50,578 --> 00:15:56,519
you know and that you're not ever gonna

319
00:15:52,259 --> 00:15:59,278
be much more than a farmer

320
00:15:56,519 --> 00:16:00,720
so something happened along the way

321
00:15:59,278 --> 00:16:03,740
where I got

322
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:06,899
seeds and I fell in love with the plant

323
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:08,879
and uh I disconnected with it for a few

324
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:10,620
years and then got a bag seed and a bud

325
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:11,820
of like ghost train Haze and said you

326
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,899
know what I'm going to try to pop this

327
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:15,720
one open

328
00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:17,519
and I sure is not enough cracked it and

329
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:19,139
it was kind of like the old days just

330
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,879
water it let it grow but I didn't really

331
00:16:19,139 --> 00:16:22,919
understand too much about the plant so

332
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:24,659
at that point I really wanted to

333
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:26,819
understand how some of these people on

334
00:16:24,659 --> 00:16:29,100
IG were like getting these you know

335
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:31,500
great yields and [ __ ] like that so it

336
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:34,220
took my interest to learn as much as I

337
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:38,339
could and I just

338
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:40,620
I can't even put into words the amount

339
00:16:38,339 --> 00:16:43,740
of passion that I have in myself for

340
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:47,039
cannabis it's beyond anything else

341
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:49,259
and everything LED down another Wormhole

342
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:51,179
from going to learn how to get better

343
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:53,159
yields and training my plants and to

344
00:16:51,179 --> 00:16:55,019
soil what's going into the soil the

345
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:56,519
science behind the soil what I can do to

346
00:16:55,019 --> 00:16:58,198
make it better

347
00:16:56,519 --> 00:17:00,240
um the environment everything I could

348
00:16:58,198 --> 00:17:03,539
learn about cannabis I did and I'm still

349
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:05,459
learning every single day but uh

350
00:17:03,539 --> 00:17:07,019
I guess at the end of the day I looked

351
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:09,259
at it and I said hey this is still

352
00:17:07,019 --> 00:17:12,240
agriculture

353
00:17:09,259 --> 00:17:14,459
it is and it was time to up my game I

354
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:17,039
can do something with my life and that

355
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:18,660
was a huge change to me and having that

356
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:20,338
much confidence when I see that and

357
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:23,298
other people that have that [ __ ]

358
00:17:20,338 --> 00:17:26,458
passion and that fire like you uh Mel

359
00:17:23,298 --> 00:17:28,139
when I saw you you had so much fire and

360
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:29,880
passion and you I just knew you needed

361
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:31,860
that little boost of confidence and a

362
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:34,320
little guidance to get you to where you

363
00:17:31,859 --> 00:17:35,939
want to go just like I did and I had a

364
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:38,819
really good friend help me out as well

365
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:41,160
so it's nice having

366
00:17:38,819 --> 00:17:43,460
make friends with people that are going

367
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:46,320
to make you a better you

368
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:49,980
if you're surrounding yourself with [ __ ]

369
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:52,019
you're going to have [ __ ] if you

370
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:54,360
surround yourself with [ __ ] leaders

371
00:17:52,019 --> 00:17:55,798
and positivity that's what you're going

372
00:17:54,359 --> 00:17:58,199
to have in your life surround yourself

373
00:17:55,798 --> 00:18:00,538
with the kind of people that you relate

374
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:02,460
to that you want to become like you know

375
00:18:00,538 --> 00:18:06,298
take inspiration from those people and

376
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:09,360
don't let people uh you know put you out

377
00:18:06,298 --> 00:18:11,700
at all it's easy where humans we're

378
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:13,379
emotional creatures but uh there's

379
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:14,759
always going to be somebody that doesn't

380
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:17,640
like you you know

381
00:18:14,759 --> 00:18:19,140
[ __ ] him there's 10 people that do like

382
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:21,720
you for everyone that hates you you know

383
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:25,259
that's why they hate you so much this is

384
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:27,660
my Mantra be friends with someone that's

385
00:18:25,259 --> 00:18:29,700
not afraid to say your name in a room

386
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:31,440
full of opportunity

387
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:33,240
you know what I'm saying like that's the

388
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:36,000
type of people I want to roll with when

389
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:37,620
I go somewhere maybe okay so I do make

390
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,298
candles on the side and you know I don't

391
00:18:37,619 --> 00:18:42,119
even talk about it because it's not

392
00:18:39,298 --> 00:18:44,639
where my heart is right so I forget that

393
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:45,839
I even do it but if I go somewhere and

394
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,360
they're like

395
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:50,939
well I don't like candles but I like

396
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:53,459
Edibles well I got somebody who knows

397
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:55,380
Edibles why like somebody who does resin

398
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:57,240
well then we'll throw them to santuli

399
00:18:55,380 --> 00:19:01,020
santuli does resin or I need someone

400
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:03,900
that does shirts well you know so we

401
00:19:01,019 --> 00:19:06,720
we move like that Sarah and I went to um

402
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:11,460
Thicket the thicket now headquarters out

403
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:13,200
in Chino and before we left we were

404
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:14,700
looked at each other and Sarah was like

405
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,440
I'm not leaving without something for

406
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:18,179
the girls and I was like I ain't neither

407
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:20,038

408
00:19:18,179 --> 00:19:22,559
gonna ask for nine tickets like are we

409
00:19:20,038 --> 00:19:25,259
gonna and Sarah was like yeah let's ask

410
00:19:22,558 --> 00:19:29,058
for [ __ ] night think it's like two

411
00:19:25,259 --> 00:19:29,058
shirts and I stood there and I was like

412
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:39,740
[Music]

413
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:42,298
we walked out of there with

414
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:45,179
ambassadorships for each and every girl

415
00:19:42,298 --> 00:19:47,660
with their own code and like

416
00:19:45,179 --> 00:19:47,660
okay

417
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:53,220
we gave them an opportunity to now

418
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:54,599
become ambassadors so they could go to

419
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:56,579
other companies and [ __ ] they know

420
00:19:54,599 --> 00:19:58,558
I've done this before I've already had

421
00:19:56,579 --> 00:20:00,899
my own code you know and they feel

422
00:19:58,558 --> 00:20:03,720
empowered and that is what a can of Boss

423
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:04,559
Beauty is my sister's success is my

424
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,740
success

425
00:20:04,558 --> 00:20:09,298
we are not in competition

426
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:10,859
but the Cannabis Community has to stop

427
00:20:09,298 --> 00:20:12,119
being in competition there's room for

428
00:20:10,859 --> 00:20:15,119
everyone

429
00:20:12,119 --> 00:20:17,038
we have a common ground so why are we

430
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:18,719
trying to be in competition with one

431
00:20:17,038 --> 00:20:21,599
another when we can help one another

432
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:25,259
there's always someone for something for

433
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:28,319
and so I'm still trying to find myself

434
00:20:25,259 --> 00:20:30,720
in Canada Queenie but that's where it

435
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:32,819
keeps leading me down that road and it's

436
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:35,640
helping other women get to where they

437
00:20:32,819 --> 00:20:37,379
gotta go and maybe coming up with an

438
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,759
idea for another woman that she didn't

439
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:42,059
think of or

440
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:43,558
but candy cure for me is more than just

441
00:20:42,058 --> 00:20:46,319
edibles

442
00:20:43,558 --> 00:20:49,139
like candy cure also does RSO and she

443
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:49,859
does like you know RSO greens and she

444
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:51,840
does

445
00:20:49,859 --> 00:20:54,538
CBD and she just

446
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:56,699
she heals my family too like I trust her

447
00:20:54,538 --> 00:20:57,599
products with my son and my husband and

448
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:00,480
so

449
00:20:57,599 --> 00:21:03,719
when I think of candy cure I Edibles

450
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:06,360
comes to mind but more her RSO and her

451
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:08,880
Dragon juice and her infused lemonade

452
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:11,339
and the way people can medicate without

453
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:14,280
smoking using her products

454
00:21:11,339 --> 00:21:16,319
you know I'm glad you brought that up

455
00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:18,240
that's something that I wanted yeah yeah

456
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:21,298
like I thought that was a more recent

457
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:24,859
Venture uh you getting into the RSO

458
00:21:21,298 --> 00:21:24,859
how did that end up coming out

459
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:31,559
um I started making RSO uh around the

460
00:21:28,798 --> 00:21:33,859
time my dad died well I made it before I

461
00:21:31,558 --> 00:21:33,859
died

462
00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:38,400
um

463
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,279
kind of for somebody

464
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:45,019
a patient who would actually buy all of

465
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:45,019
it so I never got to

466
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:51,600
confuse any of it

467
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:54,480
um and then when my the patient ended up

468
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:57,319
dying he was a cancer patient so it was

469
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,319
you know

470
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:05,519
then I started making it for myself or

471
00:22:02,579 --> 00:22:07,319
for my dad and then it was kind of too

472
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:09,418
late on that end

473
00:22:07,319 --> 00:22:11,769
also as well

474
00:22:09,419 --> 00:22:12,960
and now I kind of get to keep it as cool

475
00:22:11,769 --> 00:22:15,079
[Music]

476
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:18,360
migration and

477
00:22:15,079 --> 00:22:20,460
it's for you guys

478
00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:23,699
um I didn't really treat myself before

479
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:25,679
with any of my my medications besides

480
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:28,558
with herb um

481
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:30,780
there was a big change when I did start

482
00:22:28,558 --> 00:22:34,319
doing that now

483
00:22:30,779 --> 00:22:36,298
the inflammation has definitely changed

484
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:39,480
I know this difference a lot

485
00:22:36,298 --> 00:22:42,240
that I'm using it uh I don't have a lot

486
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:44,759
of that when I when I use the RSO I

487
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:47,460
don't have information and I don't have

488
00:22:44,759 --> 00:22:49,319
pain it's very obvious it's very it's

489
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:52,259
clear

490
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:54,980
um smoking and medicating with RSO is

491
00:22:52,259 --> 00:22:54,980
completely different

492
00:22:55,380 --> 00:23:01,820
um I feel like smoking has been almost

493
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:01,819
no benefit but for mental benefit

494
00:23:02,038 --> 00:23:05,119
um that's pretty much it

495
00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:09,419
definitely not as powerful or pain

496
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:11,400
relief

497
00:23:09,419 --> 00:23:13,440
um because when you smoke it you're

498
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:15,419
you're hitting a lot of CB1 receptors

499
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,820
when you eat it

500
00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:19,860
um or digest it like you do with RSO and

501
00:23:17,819 --> 00:23:22,259
edibles

502
00:23:19,859 --> 00:23:25,619
they're hitting CB2 receptors and those

503
00:23:22,259 --> 00:23:27,859
are a lot better at uh at treating that

504
00:23:25,619 --> 00:23:27,859
pain

505
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:34,558
100 percent

506
00:23:30,359 --> 00:23:34,558
different feeling different

507
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:39,419
um

508
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:42,298
absorption I don't know it's different

509
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:44,460
so on a daily basis uh what would you

510
00:23:42,298 --> 00:23:45,960
say milligram wise was like your

511
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:49,200
treatment

512
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:51,740
where are you like I'm okay I have very

513
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,740
little pain

514
00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:56,159
um I don't know I probably take like

515
00:23:54,839 --> 00:23:57,599
four grains

516
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:59,880
a day

517
00:23:57,599 --> 00:24:02,819
I don't think that's a lot

518
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:03,900
and your res your most recent edible you

519
00:24:02,819 --> 00:24:05,819
did uh

520
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:08,900
the lemonade the sweet tea and there's

521
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:08,899
one other what were those

522
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:21,080
300 milligram drinks I heard very good

523
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:24,000
things about that from everybody

524
00:24:21,079 --> 00:24:26,480
yes I definitely want to get in the

525
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,480
sweet tea

526
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:39,179
do you think the pink lemonade

527
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:40,759
the pink lemonade hands down the pink

528
00:24:39,179 --> 00:24:44,038
lemonade is my favorite

529
00:24:40,759 --> 00:24:45,779
what about you candy

530
00:24:44,038 --> 00:24:48,240
it's the pink lemonade

531
00:24:45,779 --> 00:24:50,279
pink was that the consensus that you got

532
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,140
and reviewed all those it was like

533
00:24:50,279 --> 00:24:53,279
everybody's saying pink lemonade or was

534
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:55,580
there something that was a little more

535
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:55,579
popular

536
00:24:56,538 --> 00:25:03,140
names I think you need a third judge and

537
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,640
I think I need to be that person

538
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:08,460
okay I'll send you

539
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:09,780
because I saw that I saw that I was like

540
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:12,179
I'm all about that

541
00:25:09,779 --> 00:25:15,418
so what's the newest Adventure

542
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:17,940
for uh your podcast there Mel let's

543
00:25:15,419 --> 00:25:21,659
shout that one out really quick oh thank

544
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:23,279
you actually I'm gonna start I've

545
00:25:21,659 --> 00:25:27,120
committed to start dropping my episodes

546
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:28,879
every Wednesdays at 4 20 p.m Eastern

547
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:32,099
Standard Time

548
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:33,740
and I think I'm gonna start focusing on

549
00:25:32,099 --> 00:25:37,139
endometriosis

550
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:38,880
uh fibromyalgia

551
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:41,759
and I think I'm going to start doing

552
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:44,580
like a dab review

553
00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:46,859
because I'm really liking the dabs

554
00:25:44,579 --> 00:25:48,778
so I think that that's the next venture

555
00:25:46,859 --> 00:25:50,658
I think I'm not going to do one-on-ones

556
00:25:48,778 --> 00:25:53,579
on the podcast I think I'm Gonna Keep

557
00:25:50,659 --> 00:25:55,559
one-on-ones on my lives and then I think

558
00:25:53,579 --> 00:25:57,480
on the podcast that's just gonna be me

559
00:25:55,558 --> 00:26:00,119
speaking no camera

560
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:02,038
and I'm gonna you know do outlines and

561
00:26:00,119 --> 00:26:04,739
I'm gonna stick to all

562
00:26:02,038 --> 00:26:06,359
kind of scripting so that's gonna change

563
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:08,759
that's gonna be different from my first

564
00:26:06,359 --> 00:26:10,859
four or five episodes

565
00:26:08,759 --> 00:26:12,500

567
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:17,640

568
00:26:15,659 --> 00:26:20,760

enjoyed waking up every day and session

599
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:34,139
with my Canon sisters I enjoyed being in

600
00:27:32,038 --> 00:27:36,419
an environment for the first time as a

601
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:39,299
woman where I was encouraged to eat

602
00:27:36,419 --> 00:27:40,679
where I was encouraged to snack where I

603
00:27:39,298 --> 00:27:43,440
could walk around with just a t-shirt

604
00:27:40,679 --> 00:27:46,259
and underwear and everyone would scream

605
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:50,100
Mel get your pants on but no one judged

606
00:27:46,259 --> 00:27:52,700
me like you know I was able to heal from

607
00:27:50,099 --> 00:27:55,439
trauma I was able to

608
00:27:52,700 --> 00:28:00,480
be away from my husband for the first

609
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:02,460
time since I was 17 years old wow and be

610
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:04,640
on an independent trip without my

611
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:08,058
partner in crime like

612
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:10,860
I had to grow I had to depend on myself

613
00:28:08,058 --> 00:28:12,899
for every single moment

614
00:28:10,859 --> 00:28:14,038
and for someone who's been in a

615
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:16,500
relationship

616
00:28:14,038 --> 00:28:19,980
more

617
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:22,980
more than she was alive without one that

618
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:26,099
was an incredible journey for me

619
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:28,019
to go on and to feel those feelings

620
00:28:26,099 --> 00:28:30,480
without being able

621
00:28:28,019 --> 00:28:33,359
to turn to my husband and have him

622
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:35,159
encourage me so I learned a lot of

623
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:37,439
self-validation

624
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:38,760
and a lot of self-correction on this

625
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:41,038
trip

626
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:43,558
so

627
00:28:41,038 --> 00:28:46,200
yeah and let me tell you Ventura beach

628
00:28:43,558 --> 00:28:47,399
was beautiful uh Pismo beach was

629
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:50,278
beautiful

630
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:53,278
uh we went to Ventura Beach at night we

631
00:28:50,278 --> 00:28:56,700
had a bonfire me candy care we were

632
00:28:53,278 --> 00:28:58,200
waiting for Rasta and you know I healed

633
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:59,580
that night on the beach I have a lot of

634
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:02,278
trauma with the beach

635
00:28:59,579 --> 00:29:04,319
and you know I held my sister's hands

636
00:29:02,278 --> 00:29:06,778
and we went into the water at night and

637
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:09,058
you know I got all of that on you know

638
00:29:06,778 --> 00:29:11,759
there were moments that maybe the girls

639
00:29:09,058 --> 00:29:14,298
didn't even realize were just Monumental

640
00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:16,919
for me and they were the small things

641
00:29:14,298 --> 00:29:19,379
that no one would think mattered but

642
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:21,778
they mattered incredibly to me like my

643
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:23,520
drive with canacure seeing where she

644
00:29:21,778 --> 00:29:25,679
grew up seeing the school she went to

645
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:28,398
you know meeting her grandmother meeting

646
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:31,798
her brother you know

647
00:29:28,398 --> 00:29:34,558
it was a privilege and it didn't it

648
00:29:31,798 --> 00:29:38,519
didn't Escape me what a privilege it was

649
00:29:34,558 --> 00:29:42,000
to be accepted into her home into Olga's

650
00:29:38,519 --> 00:29:43,259
home into Stoney the Latina's home you

651
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,240
know

652
00:29:43,259 --> 00:29:46,740
um I'm blessed to know these women you

653
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:49,079
know I didn't grow up

654
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:51,538
with this type of community so to find

655
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:54,658
it at an age where I was already

656
00:29:51,538 --> 00:29:57,119
starting to feel lost was

657
00:29:54,659 --> 00:30:00,360
um life-saving like cannabis and can a

658
00:29:57,119 --> 00:30:03,719
Queenie save me and cannabis saved me

659
00:30:00,359 --> 00:30:06,479
you know cannabis saved my life and

660
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:09,600
what I've I've encountered in Instagram

661
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:11,519
good bad or indifferent has saved my

662
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:13,139
life you have changed me for the better

663
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:15,538
so

664
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:19,080
that's my reflection

665
00:30:15,538 --> 00:30:20,879
that's all in what what year did you

666
00:30:19,079 --> 00:30:22,139
start smoking like what was your first

667
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,899
experience

668
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:27,179
well you know I'm from the South Bronx

669
00:30:24,898 --> 00:30:29,879
so I grew up around weed you know I

670
00:30:27,179 --> 00:30:32,460
always believed that weed and Hip-Hop is

671
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:34,740
the Bronx in New York like you know you

672
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:37,740
can't talk about the South Bronx and not

673
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:40,380
mention weed and Hip-Hop so I was

674
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:43,798
probably like

675
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:45,419
I want to say 15 the first time like I

676
00:30:43,798 --> 00:30:47,339
used to have a blunt with like a bacon

677
00:30:45,419 --> 00:30:49,799
egg and cheese for breakfast you know

678
00:30:47,339 --> 00:30:51,538
but it wasn't anything but to be out

679
00:30:49,798 --> 00:30:53,278
smoking with people and cutting class

680
00:30:51,538 --> 00:30:55,038
you know

681
00:30:53,278 --> 00:30:58,919
um in 2015

682
00:30:55,038 --> 00:31:01,980
I was was when my endometriosis started

683
00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:04,799
to flare and I became I had three months

684
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:07,798
left to my masters and one month left

685
00:31:04,798 --> 00:31:10,798
for my own Department after working for

686
00:31:07,798 --> 00:31:14,099
23 years to get it and bladder

687
00:31:10,798 --> 00:31:16,579
endometriosis took all that and none of

688
00:31:14,099 --> 00:31:20,158
the pain medication I was on help

689
00:31:16,579 --> 00:31:22,019
amitriptyline Gabapentin Lupron I did

690
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:25,740
chemo for it everything nothing worked

691
00:31:22,019 --> 00:31:29,398
and finally my friend's husband who was

692
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:30,899
one of my patients at the hospital he

693
00:31:29,398 --> 00:31:33,298
brought me a blunt he drove from

694
00:31:30,898 --> 00:31:35,699
Greenwich Connecticut to the to New York

695
00:31:33,298 --> 00:31:37,379
City which is like almost an hour and he

696
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:40,019
brought me a blunt and he was like yo

697
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:43,740
sis hit this and I was like no I can't

698
00:31:40,019 --> 00:31:45,898
do that you know you know if if I go

699
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:48,538
back to work they'll drug test me and he

700
00:31:45,898 --> 00:31:51,298
was like no hit this hit this

701
00:31:48,538 --> 00:31:53,700
and I remember just taking a poll

702
00:31:51,298 --> 00:31:56,639
and then by the third pull my bladder

703
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:59,278
just relaxed and pain that I have been

704
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:01,740
fighting for three years

705
00:31:59,278 --> 00:32:05,460
like it relaxed and I never turned back

706
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:10,079
but now I do more than just smoke I dab

707
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:13,079
I take RSO I take CBD you know I

708
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:15,418
I I treat it

709
00:32:13,079 --> 00:32:18,599
I do it more than just recreational now

710
00:32:15,419 --> 00:32:20,940
I feel like it's 360. I treat myself in

711
00:32:18,599 --> 00:32:22,259
different ways I did not know that much

712
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:25,500
I didn't know that you went through

713
00:32:22,259 --> 00:32:27,298
chemo for it that's yeah lupon is one of

714
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:29,298
the Lupron is one of the first

715
00:32:27,298 --> 00:32:32,099
medications they give women with

716
00:32:29,298 --> 00:32:34,440
endometriosis because what it does is it

717
00:32:32,099 --> 00:32:36,898
causes medical menopause and the thought

718
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:39,058
behind endometriosis is a dominance in

719
00:32:36,898 --> 00:32:41,398
estrogen and I know you're a dad to

720
00:32:39,058 --> 00:32:43,259
three girls so it's it's quite an

721
00:32:41,398 --> 00:32:45,778
opportunity to be able to educate you

722
00:32:43,259 --> 00:32:48,599
while they're still small because one in

723
00:32:45,778 --> 00:32:50,398
three women have endometriosis so if you

724
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:53,099
have three daughters the chances that

725
00:32:50,398 --> 00:32:58,079
one of them may have endometriosis is

726
00:32:53,099 --> 00:33:01,079
more than 76 and so uh girls as young as

727
00:32:58,079 --> 00:33:02,759
nines begin with signs of endometriosis

728
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:04,859
and

729
00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:08,220
um we don't get we don't get much

730
00:33:04,859 --> 00:33:10,740
research we don't there's no treatment

731
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:12,000
plan so what they they do is they say

732
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:13,980
well let me give you the loop run

733
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,619
because if like if you you don't have a

734
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:18,720
period in a year and then your pain goes

735
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:20,879
away well we'll do a hysterectomy

736
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,919
because that's the only way we can take

737
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:25,860
a woman's estrogen right well this is

738
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:27,480
the problem I'm on the Lupron there's

739
00:33:25,859 --> 00:33:31,139
tons of [ __ ] side effects from the

740
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:36,720
Lupine and I'm talking hair loss bone

741
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:39,059
loss bone density loss um hot flashes uh

742
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:41,700
chronic pain fibromyalgia depression

743
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:44,579
suicide anxiety these are all the side

744
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:47,100
effects and I'm still in pain

745
00:33:44,579 --> 00:33:50,220
and I'm not menstruating and I'm still

746
00:33:47,099 --> 00:33:53,418
developing new endometriomas

747
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:55,740
nobody can help and so

748
00:33:53,419 --> 00:33:58,140
endometriosis is what brought me to

749
00:33:55,740 --> 00:34:01,140
cannabis and I'm making it one of the

750
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:03,299
main parts of my platform because I keep

751
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:05,100
meeting people like you doc who have a

752
00:34:03,298 --> 00:34:07,859
daughter you know I have three daughters

753
00:34:05,099 --> 00:34:09,598
or you know a a husband who's like you

754
00:34:07,859 --> 00:34:11,460
know my wife is always in pain and I

755
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:13,500
don't know why and

756
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:17,039
it's become almost a part of the vision

757
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:20,898
and the mission to make clear that

758
00:34:17,039 --> 00:34:23,820
cannabis is the only proper treatment

759
00:34:20,898 --> 00:34:28,460
other than surgery to help with

760
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:32,460
endometriosis healing it is the only

761
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:37,740
medication that can help manage stage

762
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:40,019
four endometriosis pain period well no

763
00:34:37,739 --> 00:34:43,138
one can convince me and when you mix the

764
00:34:40,019 --> 00:34:46,199
flour with the RSO there's even studies

765
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:49,019
that show that RSO can help generate new

766
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:52,138
tissue which is what women need new

767
00:34:49,019 --> 00:34:56,280
regenerative endometrium lining tissue

768
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:58,740
so there's there's research that RSO can

769
00:34:56,280 --> 00:35:01,200
help with that and so if I can bring

770
00:34:58,739 --> 00:35:03,000
that and I can just help one woman

771
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:05,939
then my job is done

772
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,980
that's how I'm gonna bring 25 years of

773
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:10,559
clinical experience and my journey with

774
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:13,199
cannabis and endo

775
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:15,480
to the table

776
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:17,879
that's [ __ ] incredible

777
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:20,280
and see this is that passion I was

778
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:22,019
talking about as you got into that and

779
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:24,660
you told the story and you got deeper

780
00:35:22,019 --> 00:35:26,338
and deeper I can feel it bring you back

781
00:35:24,659 --> 00:35:29,279
in this is something close to you that's

782

[ __ ] amazing thank you that chemo

783
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:34,519
would not work for you but three hits of

784
00:35:31,679 --> 00:35:38,519
cannabis and you almost get instantly

785
00:35:34,519 --> 00:35:40,619
saying something about the plant facts

786
00:35:38,519 --> 00:35:43,800

807
00:36:42,539 --> 00:36:48,539
and I will tell you uh one of the

808
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:50,579
greatest tips that I could give you is

809
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:52,619
don't be afraid to fail

810
00:36:50,579 --> 00:36:55,140
nothing that you ever do for the first

811
00:36:52,619 --> 00:36:57,240
time like this are you gonna start off

812
00:36:55,139 --> 00:36:59,338
awesome or there's nothing to learn

813
00:36:57,239 --> 00:37:02,098
there's no reason to grow at all you're

814
00:36:59,338 --> 00:37:03,900
gonna [ __ ] up and I've had some big [ __ ]

815
00:37:02,099 --> 00:37:05,640
ups during this thing but all those

816
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:06,960
fuck-ups are doing if you sit there and

817
00:37:05,639 --> 00:37:09,358
you focus on them you're gonna drive

818
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:11,338
yourself insane

819
00:37:09,358 --> 00:37:13,078
um but at the end of the day like you

820
00:37:11,338 --> 00:37:15,059
got to realize you're going to [ __ ] up

821
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:16,680
and you just gotta deal with it move on

822
00:37:15,059 --> 00:37:18,119
you would not have made a decision if

823
00:37:16,679 --> 00:37:20,940
you did not think it was right at the

824
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:23,640
time so just make your decision and move

825
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:26,159
on uh but stick true to your values

826
00:37:23,639 --> 00:37:27,598
because you know not every person that

so we over at Canada Queenie we're

838
00:37:49,019 --> 00:37:53,219
always saying that our journey is like

839
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:56,400
an elevator and not everybody makes it

840
00:37:53,219 --> 00:37:57,959
to the top so on every floor people get

841
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:00,838
on and off when you're in the elevator

842
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:03,659
right so thus far we've had people get

843
00:38:00,838 --> 00:38:07,078
on and off on and off

844
00:38:03,659 --> 00:38:09,179

846
00:38:09,179 --> 00:38:13,319
kind of binding together and making it

847
00:38:11,699 --> 00:38:14,639
work I feel like we're the ones that are

848
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:16,740
just gonna make it to the top together

849

00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:51,359
days but instead what I brought you guys

861
00:38:46,099 --> 00:38:55,338
is uh this amazing arch enemy of mine

862
00:38:51,358 --> 00:38:59,719
the baby muffins oh the muffins

863
00:38:55,338 --> 00:38:59,719

864
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:06,900

865
00:39:03,179 --> 00:39:09,059
hate like one of them and I felt I I

866
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:10,099
said don't worry about it I think she

867
00:39:09,059 --> 00:39:13,078
told me

868
00:39:10,099 --> 00:39:15,720
150 milligrams and since there was three

869
00:39:13,079 --> 00:39:18,980
in there I assumed that they were you

870
00:39:15,719 --> 00:39:21,299
know 50 milligrams a piece yeah

871
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:24,300
that's right right they're 50 milligrams

872
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:25,460
a piece yeah yeah that's why she's

873
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:28,760
laughing at me

874
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:32,099
[Laughter]

875
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:36,359
so I tell her I said don't worry about

876
00:39:32,099 --> 00:39:37,800
it I said I do uh over here I don't I

877
00:39:36,358 --> 00:39:39,900
make some cookies and I make some

878
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:42,300
brownies but I'm not I'm an awesome cook

879
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:44,280
and I make some really really cool

880
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:46,019
cannabis infused dinners but I don't

881
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:47,760
[ __ ] around with Edibles too much as far

882
00:39:46,019 --> 00:39:50,759
as like treats and snacks and stuff like

883
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:52,800
that I'll do like a few salad or infused

884
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:54,780
pasta infused barbecue sauce we may

885
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,980
confuse salsa

886
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:58,320
um

887
00:39:55,980 --> 00:40:00,539
but it's just like keeping cannabis

888
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:02,519
cupboard and it's making regular recipes

889
00:40:00,539 --> 00:40:04,259
with infused ingredients you know so

890
00:40:02,519 --> 00:40:05,759
it's it's not too much different to me

891
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:07,320
but I'm not that creative where I'm

892
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:09,540
gonna go out of my way to make a nerd's

893
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:11,039
truck and [ __ ] that's incredible and

894
00:40:09,539 --> 00:40:13,199
cake pops

895
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:15,779
cake pops kind of okay there's two

896
00:40:13,199 --> 00:40:17,819
treats on it this is the high section of

897
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:21,440

898
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:21,440

wait to have it but I'll tell you why

903
00:40:31,139 --> 00:40:36,920
because when I think of Cake Pops I

904
00:40:33,358 --> 00:40:36,920
instantly think of uh

905
00:40:38,579 --> 00:40:43,380
and

906
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:45,720
they have those [ __ ] cake pops on a

907
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:46,920
stick and they want what like five six

908
00:40:45,719 --> 00:40:50,279

909
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:52,820
it's like one bite of cake just buy me a

910
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,820
piece of cake

911
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:57,680
I

912
00:40:54,679 --> 00:41:00,019
never thought about it

913
00:40:57,679 --> 00:41:03,000
you actually bought one

914
00:41:00,019 --> 00:41:05,699
no I will not pay that much for one bite

915
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:08,639
of [ __ ] cake

916
00:41:05,699 --> 00:41:11,219
if it's infused sure because that one's

917
00:41:08,639 --> 00:41:14,338
gonna [ __ ] me up you know for a while

918
00:41:11,219 --> 00:41:17,219
worth it yeah I mean that's where I got

919
00:41:14,338 --> 00:41:19,199
the lime coconut bar idea

920
00:41:17,219 --> 00:41:21,358

921
00:41:19,199 --> 00:41:22,799

1015

1016
00:46:08,059 --> 00:46:14,880
loving my nuts in your mouth knowing

1017
00:46:11,818 --> 00:46:16,559
that they were in my hair and they're in

1018
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:19,519
your mouth

1019
00:46:16,559 --> 00:46:19,519
very moment

1020
00:46:20,699 --> 00:46:25,019
okay

1021
00:46:22,318 --> 00:46:26,880
oh yeah I mean you could go as far as to

1022
00:46:25,019 --> 00:46:29,940
say there were other people involved

1023
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:32,240
between them being in your hands and

1024
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:35,159
going into my mouth

1025
00:46:32,239 --> 00:46:38,239

a lot of people

1027
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:47,579
I didn't even have to pay for it

1028
00:46:45,199 --> 00:46:49,199
now I'm trying to think about how many

1029
00:46:47,579 --> 00:46:52,160
people have touched

1030
00:46:49,199 --> 00:46:52,159

00:46:53,818 --> 00:46:59,039
dude your your nuts have been all around

1032
00:46:56,818 --> 00:47:01,259

00:46:59,039 --> 00:47:04,259

1034
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:04,260

[Music]

1036
00:47:10,139 --> 00:47:15,179
and that's saying a lot

1037
00:47:13,079 --> 00:47:18,140
most of them have an off taste everyone

1038
00:47:15,179 --> 00:47:22,019
loves a moist nutty muffin

1039
00:47:18,139 --> 00:47:25,500

1040
00:47:22,019 --> 00:47:30,259
I mean yeah I like my nuts

1041
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:30,260

1042
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:35,099

1043
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:40,579
I hate that word

1044
00:47:35,099 --> 00:47:40,579
most people do doc most people do

1045
00:47:42,679 --> 00:47:47,719
oh it just sounds so vulgar

1046
00:47:48,739 --> 00:47:54,419
sounds vulgar but not your nuts in my

1047
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:57,900
mouth you're not saying my mouth is it

1048
00:47:54,420 --> 00:48:00,480
vulgar but moist that's comedy relief

1049
00:47:57,900 --> 00:48:03,480
there's nothing comedy about moistomy

1050
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:05,219
I'm not laughing if you say moist and

1051
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:07,440
now I'm saying it driving myself and

1052
00:48:05,219 --> 00:48:09,239
saying over here and then when you put

1053
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:11,659
the muffin part in there it just got

1054
00:48:09,239 --> 00:48:11,659
worse

1055
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:18,119
I don't know I guess when it comes to

1056
00:48:14,699 --> 00:48:22,318
okay I will change my wording I too

1057

1060
00:48:24,710 --> 00:48:32,699
[Laughter]

1061

1066

1067
00:48:47,338 --> 00:48:52,380

1068
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:53,460
swear to God It's the funniest and most

1069
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:57,720
real

1070
00:48:53,460 --> 00:49:00,139
it's easy it's easy it's easy um there's

1071
00:48:57,719 --> 00:49:02,779
a another good tip for you uh

1072
00:49:00,139 --> 00:49:05,400
your number one

1073
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:07,440
best quality that you could have as a

1074
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:08,880
podcaster going into you said you

1075
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:10,679
weren't going to do the one-on-one

1076
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:13,019
interviews anymore it's extremely

1077
00:49:10,679 --> 00:49:14,818
important for that

1078
00:49:13,019 --> 00:49:16,980
um but even if you do group interviews

1079
00:49:14,818 --> 00:49:18,599
or you know smoke sessions and stuff

1080
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:21,719
like that

1081
00:49:18,599 --> 00:49:24,300
make sure your your co-hosts are

1082
00:49:21,719 --> 00:49:26,279
comfortable okay well the more you're

1083
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:28,079
over in Discord the more you'll see it

1084
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:29,540
because that's like dark and filtered

1085
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:32,339
over there

1086
00:49:29,539 --> 00:49:34,500
I get that Vibe over there that's why I

1087
00:49:32,338 --> 00:49:36,659
feel free to beat me over there too

1088
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:38,818
good that's the point behind it so yeah

1089
00:49:36,659 --> 00:49:40,559
there are no [ __ ] in Discord I don't

1090
00:49:38,818 --> 00:49:44,358
think I I don't get that back no there

1091
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:44,358
are no that's not that vibe

1092
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:50,339
Vibe shut up Mel go ahead doctor no I

1093
00:49:48,599 --> 00:49:52,318
was about to eat the last bit of this I

1094
00:49:50,338 --> 00:49:54,480
really I really feel like the best thing

1095
00:49:52,318 --> 00:49:57,539
that you could give me is feedback about

1096
00:49:54,480 --> 00:50:01,099
what I've created I feel like to be in

1097
00:49:57,539 --> 00:50:01,099
Discord you can't be a [ __ ]

1098
00:50:01,858 --> 00:50:07,259
you can't be a [ __ ] because we do a lot

1099
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:10,019
of everything is texting everything is a

1100
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:12,960
lot of it is texting and I in Discord it

1101
00:50:10,019 --> 00:50:15,900
taught me how to not read a text with

1102
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:17,760
emotion because I and a lot of no man I

1103
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:20,039
don't even know sometimes if it's a man

1104
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:22,260
or a woman because I don't know what

1105
00:50:20,039 --> 00:50:26,099
their handle or their Avatar is so

1106
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:28,859
Discord has really taught me to not read

1107
00:50:26,099 --> 00:50:31,140
something with emotion to just read the

1108
00:50:28,858 --> 00:50:33,059
words for what they are you know because

1109
00:50:31,139 --> 00:50:34,739
it could be

1110
00:50:33,059 --> 00:50:36,179
um I don't know it could be any of them

1111
00:50:34,739 --> 00:50:38,759
and they're just writing while they're

1112
00:50:36,179 --> 00:50:41,399
driving or I don't know but I learned

1113
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:44,280
how to not be such a [ __ ] in Discord

1114
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:46,500
it is what it is there's no there's like

1115
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:49,800
there's no crying in baseball there's no

1116
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:51,838
bitch-assness in Discord

1117
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:54,480
that's just me that's my thought you

1118
00:50:51,838 --> 00:50:56,699
look like I'm gonna take a screenshot of

1119
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:59,460
that during that part of the podcast

1120
00:50:56,699 --> 00:51:02,399
because you when you said you can't be a

1121
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:05,358
[ __ ] you literally got that like hard

1122
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:05,358
look like you're like

1123
00:51:07,519 --> 00:51:12,358
a [ __ ] a Discord

1124
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:15,059
I I agree and that's what I love about

1125
00:51:12,358 --> 00:51:17,578
your Discord that it's just that type of

1126
00:51:15,059 --> 00:51:20,700
vibe there's no everyone's taking shots

1127
00:51:17,579 --> 00:51:22,920
everyone's light-hearted everyone is and

1128
00:51:20,699 --> 00:51:25,259
I feel like I'm home there I feel like

1129
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:27,180
I'm just amongst a bunch of cousins

1130
00:51:25,260 --> 00:51:29,880
everybody's taking shots you know that's

1131
00:51:27,179 --> 00:51:31,618
me yeah and there's there's a lot more

1132
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:33,900
to experience about it like you were

1133
00:51:31,619 --> 00:51:36,000
saying not reading info or not reading

1134
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:37,139
emotions into what people are writing in

1135
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:41,699
there

1136
00:51:37,139 --> 00:51:43,799
um I try to stick to I I do so much

1137
00:51:41,699 --> 00:51:45,838
anymore it's hard for me to stick to one

1138
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:48,300
single thing talking to one person for

1139
00:51:45,838 --> 00:51:50,219
too long messaging everything throughout

1140
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:51,960
my day I'd rather send you a you know

1141
00:51:50,219 --> 00:51:54,179
voice chat or something because I'm

1142
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:56,818
[ __ ] I can't type to that many people

1143
00:51:54,179 --> 00:51:59,818
a day it ain't gonna happen

1144
00:51:56,818 --> 00:52:02,338
um but I try to make the focus on it

1145
00:51:59,818 --> 00:52:03,659
where there is cannabis information we

1146
00:52:02,338 --> 00:52:06,179
can share different things talk about

1147
00:52:03,659 --> 00:52:08,699
things and text fine but I've really

1148
00:52:06,179 --> 00:52:10,500
really have been trying to focus on the

1149
00:52:08,699 --> 00:52:12,779
video and that's why we have like the

1150
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:14,219
voice smoke room sessions and stuff

1151
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:15,960
where you can turn on your camera you

1152
00:52:14,219 --> 00:52:18,299
can turn on your audio you can get to

1153
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:19,800

00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:07,019
say and Cat when we were in Cali and we

1193
00:54:05,099 --> 00:54:09,240
would choke on the dab we were like

1194
00:54:07,019 --> 00:54:10,739
don't be a [ __ ] don't be a [ __ ] you

1195
00:54:09,239 --> 00:54:14,539
better [ __ ] swallow that [ __ ] you

1196
00:54:10,739 --> 00:54:14,539
better not throw up smoke

1197
00:54:20,239 --> 00:54:25,618
yo we were trying to see like who could

1198
00:54:22,619 --> 00:54:28,920
take the big crazy

1199
00:54:25,619 --> 00:54:31,940
it's like a sorority frat house this is

1200
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:34,380
funny it was that's awesome

1201
00:54:31,940 --> 00:54:38,039
you've ever been

1202
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:41,039
absolutely I mean I normally I've never

1203
00:54:38,039 --> 00:54:44,219
dabbed so much in my life so now when I

1204
00:54:41,039 --> 00:54:46,318
find myself without dabs I can feel the

1205
00:54:44,219 --> 00:54:49,199
difference with just flower and I'm not

1206
00:54:46,318 --> 00:54:51,779
happy I want to be a you see me with my

1207
00:54:49,199 --> 00:54:53,460
flat iron Dot I'm trying to make

1208
00:54:51,780 --> 00:54:54,780
homemade dabs I don't even know what the

1209
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:57,179
hell I'm doing

1210
00:54:54,780 --> 00:54:59,460
nobody wants to be an overnight success

1211
00:54:57,179 --> 00:55:02,399
I actually talked to another podcaster

1212
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:04,920
one time that had a reel that went super

1213
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:06,358
viral and everything and she said that's

1214
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:10,920
the worst thing that's ever happened to

1215
00:55:06,358 --> 00:55:13,858
me I said well why because then you have

1216
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:15,539
one video that's getting you know a

1217
00:55:13,858 --> 00:55:17,699
million views

1218
00:55:15,539 --> 00:55:19,440
and you're getting no interaction at all

1219
00:55:17,699 --> 00:55:22,019
why because these people like that video

1220
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:23,700
they didn't like you you know and

1221
00:55:22,019 --> 00:55:26,159
there's gonna be a couple that stop by

1222
00:55:23,699 --> 00:55:28,139
but as far as the algorithms concerned

1223
00:55:26,159 --> 00:55:29,940
you fell off the face of the Earth it's

1224
00:55:28,139 --> 00:55:32,358
like being a one-hit wonder back in the

1225
00:55:29,940 --> 00:55:32,358
90s

1226
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:37,920
be that slow is the best place to get to

1227
00:55:35,639 --> 00:55:40,199
where you want to go

1228
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:41,818
look I think I believe low and slow is

1229
00:55:40,199 --> 00:55:45,019
the best way to do

1230
00:55:41,818 --> 00:55:45,019
damn near anything

1231
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:49,380
food grow a server grow a following you

1232
00:55:48,719 --> 00:55:51,959
know

1233
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:54,440
try to get live rosin out of flour with

1234
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:54,440
a flat iron

1235
00:55:54,679 --> 00:56:00,598
okay so that brings up Point number two

1236
00:55:57,719 --> 00:56:01,919
about the flat iron and me because my

1237
00:56:00,599 --> 00:56:04,140
perception was a little bit different

1238
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:05,700
you said you were in the elevator

1239
00:56:04,139 --> 00:56:09,539
uh

1240
00:56:05,699 --> 00:56:11,399
I've always pictured one road it's the

1241
00:56:09,539 --> 00:56:13,679
beginning of your life this is the end

1242
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:15,019
of your life everybody's on that same

1243
00:56:13,679 --> 00:56:18,179
[ __ ] road

1244
00:56:15,019 --> 00:56:20,460
some people walk faster than others some

1245
00:56:18,179 --> 00:56:22,199
people walk a little bit slower we're on

1246
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:23,519
different paths but we're all on the

1247
00:56:22,199 --> 00:56:26,639
same [ __ ] Journey so it doesn't

1248
00:56:23,519 --> 00:56:28,679
matter if uh you're 80 years old and I'm

1249
00:56:26,639 --> 00:56:31,139
20 years old I might know something that

1250
00:56:28,679 --> 00:56:33,299
you don't and you probably know a lot

1251
00:56:31,139 --> 00:56:36,420
more than I do you know it doesn't

1252
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:38,400
matter age is just a number but we all

1253
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:40,920
go down these different Paths of Life at

1254
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:43,139
a different rate so don't there's no

1255
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:46,380
reason to compete with anybody

1256
00:56:43,139 --> 00:56:48,118
yeah I agree and I think some of the

1257
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:51,660
best changes I've made

1258
00:56:48,119 --> 00:56:53,700
thus far have been from the women in my

1259
00:56:51,659 --> 00:56:56,159
group that are not mothers and are

1260
00:56:53,699 --> 00:56:56,818
probably 20 years younger than me

1261
00:56:56,159 --> 00:56:58,679
um

1262
00:56:56,818 --> 00:57:01,800
I think I've had tough conversations

1263
00:56:58,679 --> 00:57:04,858
with my kids because in my cannibals

1264
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:07,140
Beauties I got young mothers like uh

1265
00:57:04,858 --> 00:57:09,719
Bella and then I have someone young like

1266
00:57:07,139 --> 00:57:12,539
Stoney who's not a mom and I get both

1267
00:57:09,719 --> 00:57:15,239
perspectives and because we love each

1268
00:57:12,539 --> 00:57:17,880
other like unconditionally like that

1269
00:57:15,239 --> 00:57:19,919
I'm open to all of their advice they're

1270
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:21,119
open to all my advice and together we

1271
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:22,980
grow

1272
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:26,039
that's just how I think about it you

1273
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:27,960
know so I don't care if you're 20 or

1274
00:57:26,039 --> 00:57:30,420
you're 60 I'm going to learn something

1275
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:34,079
from a conversation because we are not

1276
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:35,579
at that same age sweet we're not

1277
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:38,220
experiencing things at the same time

1278
00:57:35,579 --> 00:57:40,440
we're like we are elected plants you

1279
00:57:38,219 --> 00:57:42,118
were explaining like taking one and

1280
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:44,159
taking another and putting them into

1281
00:57:42,119 --> 00:57:45,480
separate environments and even if

1282
00:57:44,159 --> 00:57:48,838
they're the same string they're going to

1283
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:51,240
grow different so and I got a whole

1284
00:57:48,838 --> 00:57:55,500
bunch of streams cannibals beauty is a

1285
00:57:51,239 --> 00:57:58,979
hybrid and so I'm taking the best out of

1286
00:57:55,500 --> 00:58:02,039
each plant that's in front of me and I'm

1287
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:04,199
creating something amazing I'm creating

1288
00:58:02,039 --> 00:58:06,779
a happy Miracle or what do you call

1289
00:58:04,199 --> 00:58:08,639
those happy accidents or no they're not

1290
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:11,160
accidents they're happy Miracles they're

1291
00:58:08,639 --> 00:58:13,940
happy manifests oh you can keep the

1292
00:58:11,159 --> 00:58:17,098
happy accidents

1293
00:58:13,940 --> 00:58:19,139
I'm a huge Bob Ross fan and would you

1294
00:58:17,099 --> 00:58:23,000
not make mistakes we only make happy

1295
00:58:19,139 --> 00:58:26,639
little accidents so I think

1296
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:29,338
yeah I grew up in an environment where

1297
00:58:26,639 --> 00:58:31,980
if you weren't a mom you could never

1298
00:58:29,338 --> 00:58:33,900
give advice to a mom you know you would

1299
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:35,280
hear something like oh if you don't got

1300
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:37,858
a kid you don't you'll never understand

1301
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:40,079
and that's that's a false statement you

1302
00:58:37,858 --> 00:58:43,380
know some of the best advice you can get

1303
00:58:40,079 --> 00:58:45,720
as a mom comes from someone who isn't a

1304
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:47,539
mom because they they're not jaded they

1305
00:58:45,719 --> 00:58:49,739
haven't lost sleep they haven't

1306
00:58:47,539 --> 00:58:51,779
sacrificed for their they haven't gone

1307
00:58:49,739 --> 00:58:53,639
through that they're not jaded it's the

1308
00:58:51,780 --> 00:58:56,940
most innocent

1309
00:58:53,639 --> 00:58:59,818
like sometimes Stony will say oh why

1310
00:58:56,940 --> 00:59:01,200
don't you ask Marcos like this and I'm

1311
00:58:59,818 --> 00:59:02,880
like I didn't even think about that

1312
00:59:01,199 --> 00:59:05,519
because she's not dealing with those

1313
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:08,099
stresses she's easy to just sit back and

1314
00:59:05,519 --> 00:59:09,780
give almost the most innocent point of

1315
00:59:08,099 --> 00:59:12,480
view so

1316
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:14,700
who am I to tell someone they don't have

1317
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:17,519
a right to give me advice what if that

1318
00:59:14,699 --> 00:59:20,460
advice is the most best life-changing I

1319
00:59:17,519 --> 00:59:22,679
could get you got to stay open

1320
00:59:20,460 --> 00:59:24,179
the same way you opened up your mind to

1321
00:59:22,679 --> 00:59:27,679
different strains when you go to a

1322
00:59:24,179 --> 00:59:30,719
dispensary and you're willing to just to

1323
00:59:27,679 --> 00:59:32,279
you're willing to experiment

1324
00:59:30,719 --> 00:59:33,779
I feel like you got to do that with

1325
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:36,359
people you just got to be willing to

1326
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:38,280
experiment with different people and see

1327
00:59:36,358 --> 00:59:40,619
where it takes you

1328
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:43,079
what's pushed you what's Driven your

1329
00:59:40,619 --> 00:59:45,559
confidence and helped you out more than

1330
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:45,559
anything else

1331
00:59:46,199 --> 00:59:49,980
um

1332
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:55,318
I don't need anybody to approve

1333
00:59:49,980 --> 00:59:57,420
or validate who I am that's up to me and

1334
00:59:55,318 --> 01:00:00,480
once I stopped waiting for people to

1335
00:59:57,420 --> 01:00:04,079
like me and I started to like myself

1336
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:05,460
I I realized that I had been in my own

1337
01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:07,019
way the whole time

1338
01:00:05,460 --> 01:00:11,039
so

1339
01:00:07,019 --> 01:00:12,780
I'm not looking now for anyone to

1340
01:00:11,039 --> 01:00:14,279
tell me what they want to see from me

1341
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:16,260
I'm gonna give them what they got I'm

1342
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:19,040
gonna give you what I got and if you say

1343
01:00:16,260 --> 01:00:20,880
you say if you don't you don't

1344
01:00:19,039 --> 01:00:23,159
I'm good

1345
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:23,940
I've learned to be good I'm good I'm

1346
01:00:23,159 --> 01:00:27,259
good

1347
01:00:23,940 --> 01:00:27,260
what about you candy care

1348
01:00:29,460 --> 01:00:37,220
it's okay

1349
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:40,858
like I just don't listen to anybody else

1350
01:00:37,219 --> 01:00:42,539
[ __ ] and I just listen to my own

1351
01:00:40,858 --> 01:00:47,460
my own

1352
01:00:42,539 --> 01:00:49,739
so my own God and my you know because

1353
01:00:47,460 --> 01:00:52,500
all the other noise

1354
01:00:49,739 --> 01:00:55,019
is what it is

1355
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:58,619
noise

1356
01:00:55,019 --> 01:01:01,699
and I know what I I like I guess I need

1357
01:00:58,619 --> 01:01:05,338
and I and I just block everything

1358
01:01:01,699 --> 01:01:07,739
else out and it works

1359
01:01:05,338 --> 01:01:10,500
not the best advice

1360
01:01:07,739 --> 01:01:13,019
yeah you focus on those stressors you're

1361
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:15,539
going to become stressed it's not

1362
01:01:13,019 --> 01:01:18,119
helping you out if there's nothing you

1363
01:01:15,539 --> 01:01:21,000
can do to change something it there's no

1364
01:01:18,119 --> 01:01:22,619
reason to waste your time stressing out

1365
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:25,219
about it because you can do nothing

1366
01:01:22,619 --> 01:01:25,220
about it

1367
01:01:26,838 --> 01:01:30,900
going to not like you people are not

1368
01:01:29,338 --> 01:01:32,159
gonna like some of the decisions that

1369
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:33,960
you make

1370
01:01:32,159 --> 01:01:36,239
but as long as you're cool with what you

1371
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:37,920
did you need to stick to that [ __ ] don't

1372
01:01:36,239 --> 01:01:39,598
give a [ __ ] what anybody else thinks

1373
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:40,980
because it's not about them it's about

1374
01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:43,019
you

1375
01:01:40,980 --> 01:01:45,358
exactly

1376
01:01:43,019 --> 01:01:47,639
you're not there to bring have them

1377
01:01:45,358 --> 01:01:51,119
criticize what you're doing

1378
01:01:47,639 --> 01:01:54,298
to change it or warp it into something

1379
01:01:51,119 --> 01:01:57,420
that you did not intend

1380
01:01:54,298 --> 01:02:00,719
always block the noise

1381
01:01:57,420 --> 01:02:02,940
that would be the best piece of advice I

1382
01:02:00,719 --> 01:02:03,539
would give someone

1383
01:02:02,940 --> 01:02:07,139
um

1384
01:02:03,539 --> 01:02:09,980
don't share every idea with everyone

1385
01:02:07,139 --> 01:02:13,500
some ideas just need to keep yourself

1386
01:02:09,980 --> 01:02:16,019
and hold favorite because not everybody

1387
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:19,500
is supposed to understand your journey

1388
01:02:16,019 --> 01:02:21,838
and so sometimes the opinion of opinion

1389
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:23,519
of others could really block the

1390
01:02:21,838 --> 01:02:26,900
blessings that are right in front of you

1391
01:02:23,519 --> 01:02:29,358
so sometimes the the ideas that you have

1392
01:02:26,900 --> 01:02:32,519
as as

1393
01:02:29,358 --> 01:02:35,338
enthusiastic as you are you have to be

1394
01:02:32,519 --> 01:02:37,440
able to bring that in for a minute and

1395
01:02:35,338 --> 01:02:39,480
take time to focus on it before you

1396
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:42,059
share it with the world not everybody

1397
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:43,798
deserves a seat at your table they

1398
01:02:42,059 --> 01:02:46,500
really have to earn it you know don't

1399
01:02:43,798 --> 01:02:48,960
give that away so freely

1400
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:51,900
that's my biggest advice don't give away

1401
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:53,940
your talent so freely and even your

1402
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:56,639
respect that's a damn good piece of

1403
01:02:53,940 --> 01:02:58,619
advice thank you for uh saying that I

1404
01:02:56,639 --> 01:03:00,239
actually could use that see you're

1405
01:02:58,619 --> 01:03:02,039
helping me out just as much as I help

1406
01:03:00,239 --> 01:03:05,159
you out and that's something I love

1407
01:03:02,039 --> 01:03:07,519
about both of you both of you sorry I'm

1408
01:03:05,159 --> 01:03:11,279
going to say both to you guys

1409
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:13,559
it's okay I call my daughter's dude it's

1410
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:16,559
okay I'm okay with it I'm okay with it

1411
01:03:13,559 --> 01:03:18,480
personally I'm all right with it okay so

1412
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:21,180
that's something I love about both y'all

1413
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:24,599
is uh you're very very strong

1414
01:03:21,179 --> 01:03:27,899
independent women but you are also very

1415
01:03:24,599 --> 01:03:29,400
inclusive like you were saying uh when I

1416
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:31,500
first met both of you you guys were

1417
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:33,180
doing lives that you do regularly with

1418
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:34,739
all of your Cannon boss Beauties and

1419
01:03:33,179 --> 01:03:36,960
it's always a different you know

1420
01:03:34,739 --> 01:03:38,939
arrangement of y'all but you all have

1421
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:41,039
you all bring something to the table

1422
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:42,838
that's a little bit different but you're

1423
01:03:41,039 --> 01:03:46,019
all there for the same reason and that's

1424
01:03:42,838 --> 01:03:48,119
what attracted me to you guys's lives so

1425
01:03:46,019 --> 01:03:50,659
much right from the get-go is there's a

1426
01:03:48,119 --> 01:03:53,280
lot of passion there's a lot of [ __ ]

1427
01:03:50,659 --> 01:03:54,838
mainly Sisterhood I'm gonna say yes

1428
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:56,880
there's some men in there but there's a

1429
01:03:54,838 --> 01:03:58,558
lot of Sisterhood beyond all of y'all

1430
01:03:56,880 --> 01:04:00,900
and even the men that you hang out with

1431
01:03:58,559 --> 01:04:04,440
you're very very close with

1432
01:04:00,900 --> 01:04:06,480
um but you guys especially with how

1433
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:08,220
close you are when you start going off

1434
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:10,679
on stuff like we just did with the

1435
01:04:08,219 --> 01:04:13,798
[ __ ] nut muffins that's when I just

1436
01:04:10,679 --> 01:04:16,440
go crazies because it's like you guys

1437
01:04:13,798 --> 01:04:19,079
did such a good job at talking about

1438
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:21,179
cannabis being serious going in depth

1439
01:04:19,079 --> 01:04:22,260
about different things that have helped

1440
01:04:21,179 --> 01:04:24,179
you

1441
01:04:22,260 --> 01:04:26,700
but then you just go off the rails and

1442
01:04:24,179 --> 01:04:29,879
that's exactly how I like my podcast as

1443
01:04:26,699 --> 01:04:34,139
well so you guys all did an awesome job

1444
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:36,298
your story is extremely moving Mel

1445
01:04:34,139 --> 01:04:37,980
you not already know how I feel about

1446
01:04:36,298 --> 01:04:40,079
you and your story

1447
01:04:37,980 --> 01:04:43,740
um you are one of the strongest women

1448
01:04:40,079 --> 01:04:46,980
that I've ever met so I

1449
01:04:43,739 --> 01:04:48,899
I just got Mass respect for both of you

1450
01:04:46,980 --> 01:04:50,639
um before we get going here

1451
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:51,900
through all your years of cannabis

1452
01:04:50,639 --> 01:04:54,500
what's been your favorite thing you've

1453
01:04:51,900 --> 01:04:54,500
ever smoked

1454
01:04:56,159 --> 01:04:59,480
I'll let Sarah go first

1455
01:05:00,420 --> 01:05:10,460
um I just want to say I remember smoking

1456
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:10,460
something like Skywalker OG way back

1457
01:05:10,619 --> 01:05:14,480
it was like well

1458
01:05:12,239 --> 01:05:14,479
yeah

1459
01:05:15,838 --> 01:05:21,659
um the OG Mist obviously but

1460
01:05:19,199 --> 01:05:25,858
it was definitely

1461
01:05:21,659 --> 01:05:28,558
definitely a head head high but like

1462
01:05:25,858 --> 01:05:31,159
also a body high

1463
01:05:28,559 --> 01:05:31,160
I know

1464
01:05:32,059 --> 01:05:36,359
santulli's blueberry

1465
01:05:34,619 --> 01:05:38,599
hands

1466
01:05:36,358 --> 01:05:42,838
hands down

1467
01:05:38,599 --> 01:05:44,700
santuli's blueberry I smoked it at her

1468
01:05:42,838 --> 01:05:46,980
house back it was a day before my

1469
01:05:44,699 --> 01:05:50,279
birthday I'll never forget it was Friday

1470
01:05:46,980 --> 01:05:53,219
May 13th and I sat there in her on her

1471
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:55,160
sofa and I took that first pull from a

1472
01:05:53,219 --> 01:05:59,699
white owl

1473
01:05:55,159 --> 01:06:03,480
and instantaneously my head got fuzzy

1474
01:05:59,699 --> 01:06:06,298
my body pain relaxed and it was like
