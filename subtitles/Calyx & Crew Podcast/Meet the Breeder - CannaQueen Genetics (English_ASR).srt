40
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:27,599
fun stream

41
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:29,679
nice

42
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:31,919
so i wanted to talk to you a little bit

43
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,680
about your history with this plant when

44
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,359
did all this come about when did you

45
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,000
first start smoking

46
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:39,759
um i think i first started i actually

47
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,078
remember the very first time i smoked or

48
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:44,000
smoking on like an abandoned school bus

49
00:01:42,078 --> 00:01:45,039
in like this fishing town

50
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,879
and

51
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,479
yeah everybody was like all like you

52
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:50,478
know their eyes were [ __ ] and like they

53
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:52,640
were giggling and i was just like what

54
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:54,719
is wrong with these people

55
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,320
so you know i realized that you know i

56
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:57,840
guess maybe you know

57
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:59,359
that first time you don't get high i

58
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,439
don't know maybe i just didn't realize

59
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:02,879
that i was high i don't know

60
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:04,798
but just

61
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:06,239
i didn't get high my first time either

62
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,399
yeah yeah like it's a common thing i

63
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:09,519
think but then it's like how can you not

64
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,959
like what is

65
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,760
it's like maybe what is wrong with you

66
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:16,239
maybe your endocrine cannabinoid system

67
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:18,639
is like so empty because you've never

68
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:20,480
you know fulfilled it that that first

69
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:21,759
high goes straight into your receptors i

70
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:23,519
don't know it's kind of crazy to think

71
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:25,359
about yeah or those receptors don't know

72
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,879
how to react to what's going on for the

73
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,680
first time you know

74
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:31,439
yeah could be it could be yeah so my

75
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,719
first time nope didn't get high second

76
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:35,359
time i

77
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:36,400
uh slept for like 18 hours

78
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,560
nice

79
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,159
do you remember what you were smoking on

80
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,878
actually back then i was just like it

81
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:44,639
was like the [ __ ] or you know um bc bud

82
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:46,878
or you know what i mean so we never

83
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:48,559
really know we're spoken but it was like

84
00:02:46,878 --> 00:02:50,079
right in the air where the cannabis

85
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,840
started changing from like the mexican

86
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,239
brickweed all the time to like actual

87
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,159
like christmas tree buzz and the mango

88
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,000
stuff and you know that's when it

89
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:59,759
started like really blooming that's

90
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,759
about the time that i started as well

91
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:03,840
like when you start going from green bud

92
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:06,959
to actually having some names like white

93
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,400
rhino and stuff like that um i remember

94
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,719
when we actually started calling it

95
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,879
names other than oh this is chronic this

96
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:16,639
is mers you know

97
00:03:12,878 --> 00:03:18,799
and i i think the west coast merch is

98
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:20,958
the equivalent of the east coast

99
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,120
uh would you say [ __ ]

100
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,878
yeah like the crippy the

101
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,560
yeah was that

102
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:28,239
hydro or

103
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,878
iconic you know what i mean there was

104
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,560
just like a blanket name for him

105
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:34,959
yeah we called it either hydro or

106
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,199
chronic that whole that whole [ __ ] thing

107
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:39,360
the crippy that seems to be an east

108
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:41,280
coaster i'm just not familiar with it

109
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,319
but i'm here yeah i was born and raised

110
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,799
in florida so uh it was definitely more

111
00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:48,158
of an east coaster thing but a lot of

112
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,680
people it started moving you know it

113
00:03:48,158 --> 00:03:53,598
started moving everywhere to new york

114
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:55,920
and um california and stuff like that so

115
00:03:53,598 --> 00:03:57,119
nice all right so how old were you at

116
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:58,839
this point

117
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,719
i think i was probably about

118
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:04,239
15 turning 16 something like that okay

119
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:05,919
okay

120
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:09,039
so

121
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:10,878
at what point did you go from smoking

122
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:12,318
cannabis to saying i want to grow this

123
00:04:10,878 --> 00:04:14,399
for myself

124
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:15,759
so i do have to rewind a little bit a

125
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,560
little bit after i started smoking

126
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:20,079
cannabis i started realizing that some

127
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,600
things were changing as far as like my

128
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:25,519
brain chemicals i wasn't i wasn't as uh

129
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,600
i don't want to say sad but like i had a

130
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:29,599
pretty tough childhood and i went

131
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,919
through a lot and it wasn't the best

132
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,759
home life and so every time i smoked i

133
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:35,839
really felt like it was doing something

134
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,439
different like it was touching my soul

135
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:39,359
and like i just i didn't smoke for the

136
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:41,360
same reasons everybody else said yeah

137
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,720
like i was gonna like be around my

138
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,240
friends like yeah we're getting high

139
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,360
like let's get high but like really i

140
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,079
knew it was doing something different

141
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:51,040
for me so the minute i had the chance to

142
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:53,279
uh pop a seat i did i think it was like

143
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,800
14 when i popped my first seed and tried

144
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:56,799
to grow it outside in florida i don't

145
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,680
know if you know about florida but

146
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:02,478
it's uh it's humid it's hot it's you

147
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,800
know hurricanes and so uh you know the

148
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:06,719
winds blew really hard blew my little

149
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,840
tree over and i was so depressed and sad

150
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,240
about it but

151
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:12,159
that was my little first experience and

152
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,840
then i married when i was about 18 and

153
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,080
we moved away from florida and we

154
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:17,359
traveled the entire country so

155
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:18,879
um i

156
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,800
yeah so i kind of like put that on the

157
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:22,159
back burner but we ended up landing in

158
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,160
colorado

159
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,400
at fort carson and he actually got

160
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,400
kicked out of the army for testing

161
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:29,120
positive for cannabis

162
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:31,758
so

163
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,360
he got a general yeah it really sucked

164
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,560
because it was our livelihood we lived

165
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,919
on post

166
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,759
um

167
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:39,198
anyway long story short he got kicked

168
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,199
out we ended up staying in colorado and

169
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,400
i'm like oh yeah like i'm gonna start

170
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,038
growing so

171
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:46,159
my friend's husband he was a military

172
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:48,159
veteran

173
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,439
and uh he was like he was already

174
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,199
growing so every time i go to her house

175
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:53,918
i'm like can i see it can i like just

176
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:56,240
see it i just want to look at it

177
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:57,918
right and uh finally she was like i

178
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,160
don't know you know he's not here he's

179
00:05:57,918 --> 00:06:01,680
really protective blah blah blah

180
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,520
so finally one day he was there and he

181
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,600
was like hell yeah come on

182
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:08,399
so he took me in there and i i've never

183
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,720
felt such joy in my entire life seeing

184
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:11,519
what i saw in that that garage that day

185
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,039
so

186
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:14,478
nice what were what were some of those

187
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:16,879
first ones that you grew

188
00:06:14,478 --> 00:06:18,318
so yeah so i ended up seeing his grow

189
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:21,360
room and i was like yep that's it i'm

190
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:22,319
growing so i linked up with a local guy

191
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,280
there

192
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:27,120
and he had a bunch of seeds reserved

193
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:29,359
saved up from his you know his dad from

194
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:32,079
like 80s to the 90s so we had like

195
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,600
elephant stompers strawberry cough and

196
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:35,120
wi-fi

197
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,520
og

198
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,360
ak-47 destroyer

199
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:40,639
um there was some really good classic

200
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,120
ones in there

201
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:45,120
and um so yeah that's a blue dream so

202
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,439
yeah that's like the strains that i

203
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,598
started up with my first row

204
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:52,160
very cool so you're growing at a young

205
00:06:49,598 --> 00:06:54,079
age um you started smoking at a young

206
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,319
age how long

207
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:58,719
did it take you while you were growing

208
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:01,039
until you decide you know i want to make

209
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,800
the step in making some types of

210
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:04,560
cannabis that work for me

211
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,240
that i can produce for myself under the

212
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,000
name canoquin

213
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,079
so this isn't a story that i get to

214
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,319
share very often this is a story that

215
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:14,879
it's actually literally what sparked

216
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,879
my joy to do more than just grow and

217
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:18,959
i'll try to like make it short it's kind

218
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:21,038
of a long story but my neighbor he was a

219
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:23,038
retired not retired but he was he was

220
00:07:21,038 --> 00:07:25,120
medically discharged from the army

221
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:28,079
he had ptsd and he had a lot of pain and

222
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:30,319
he had epilepsy and so he was having

223
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:31,359
probably about seven seizures a day on a

224
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:33,360
good day

225
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,720
and they were 25 years old and i just

226
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,759
watched this and him and his wife and

227
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,520
like they were trying to start their

228
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,038
life out and they were just stumbling

229
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:41,120
and falling and

230
00:07:39,038 --> 00:07:42,879
um they were smoking spice at the time

231
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,478
which at the time was you know it had

232
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:46,159
been killing people

233
00:07:44,478 --> 00:07:47,758
and so i'm like he can't be smoking that

234
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,479
he has epilepsy what's wrong with you

235
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,000
like

236
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:52,000
that's probably why he's having seven

237
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,519
seizures a day you know

238
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,360
so i grew a clone from that said uh

239
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:59,120
military veteran

240
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,038
that was my friend's husband it was ace

241
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,560
of spades and

242
00:08:01,038 --> 00:08:04,318
i realized that it didn't get me that

243
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:07,519
high but like i knew i knew what that

244
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,800
meant you know like that it had some cbd

245
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:10,560
factors to it

246
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,639
so i offered him an ounce from like one

247
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,160
of my very first harvest

248
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,639
like real good harvest like i had a

249
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:19,120
thousand watt raptor eighties like

250
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,319
flying fan like i had the whole shebang

251
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,360
name drop

252
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,280
i remember

253
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,280
well you know that was at the time like

254
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:26,559
that was those are the [ __ ]

255
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:28,719
yeah

256
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,478
so i handed uh his wife an ounce of the

257
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,479
ace of spades and i said

258
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:35,038
tell him just to smoke this like put the

259
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,839
spice down just give this a a chance you

260
00:08:35,038 --> 00:08:37,838
know

261
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:40,560
and it probably took about a whole month

262
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:42,320
for her to come to me and be like dude

263
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:44,719
he quit smoking the spice he started

264
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:47,600
smoking the aces you know the weed she's

265
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,800
like he's been 43 days without a seizure

266
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,120
i'm like

267
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:53,039
no way like literally that i knew that

268
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,839
wasn't my strain but i knew i wanted to

269
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:57,759
have that pride from something i created

270
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,600
it would be a medicine that you created

271
00:08:57,759 --> 00:09:01,600
for a patient so

272
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,120
it doesn't matter

273
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,040
it was medicine that you produced that

274
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,839
you made and you helped somebody with it

275
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:07,360
that's

276
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:09,200
there's nothing better

277
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,839
yeah it was the most amazing feeling

278
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,519
that i had ever had so yeah he he ended

279
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,600
up you know getting a quality of life

280
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,799
back unfortunately they divorced and she

281
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,360
went on her way but there was a lot of

282
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:21,439
damage done between you know before he

283
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,440
he healed himself which you change you

284
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:26,160
know and things change but he i see him

285
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:28,480
today and he's he's healthy and happy

286
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:30,480
and it's just crazy so yeah that was

287
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,000
that was the fire that got started in

288
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,920
canada queen's soul

289
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,600
and uh so was that one of the first

290
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:38,000
plants that you bred with

291
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:40,480
actually no i didn't agree with that um

292
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,600
i got picked up by a state uh breeder in

293
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,600

294
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,278

306
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,959

00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,760
like i need you to have to

310
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:16,000
uh this cbd straight and i was like oh

311
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:17,919
here's my chance you know it was like

312
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,839
destin you know like that is the cbd

313
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:22,159
strength a foot in the door for sure

314
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:23,760
yeah absolutely uh long story short i

315
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:25,519
did the breeding project i made three

316
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:27,838
little men gails that was my very first

317
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:29,600
strain it's a three to one cd

318
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:33,040
it has 11 to 18

319
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,720
it is um harlequin times tsunami or sour

320
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:37,278
tsunami times an unknown west coast

321
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:39,278
stream he he had it listed as unknown

322
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:41,519
west coast strain and i i think that was

323
00:10:39,278 --> 00:10:44,480
his way of protecting it at the time

324
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,919
um but he had it tested and um

325
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,959
yeah it tested that you know three to

326
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:48,159
one so

327
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:49,919
i was like

328
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:52,078
he got half the seed stock and then i

329
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:54,479
got half the seed stock and you know he

330
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:55,919
made a good chunk of money off of it and

331
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,240
we parted ways and he hooked me up with

332
00:10:55,919 --> 00:11:00,559
another breeder and then i realized that

333
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,639
i you know these guys were using me to

334
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:05,039
breed behind the scenes for them

335
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:07,278
with no name and i was like nope this is

336
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:08,719
my time like i'm gonna step forward and

337
00:11:07,278 --> 00:11:10,159
i ended up you know

338
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,079
partnership with

339
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:15,439
the other the second breeder and then

340
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:18,159
canna queen genetics was born in 2018.

341
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,079
that's awesome and at this time when you

342
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:21,919
were getting into it what what was some

343
00:11:20,078 --> 00:11:25,120
of your main intentions on breeding

344
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:27,120
cannabis was it all cbd related

345
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,200
actually no that was really my only cbd

346
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,440
project i started going more towards a

347
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,360
very high thc

348
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,600
you know what was what the hype was i

349
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,519
was trying to go like towards the mark

350
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,278
where the market was going and

351
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,959
i had already bred

352
00:11:39,278 --> 00:11:43,519
under a different breeder's name a bunch

353
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:45,759
of really killer strains so

354
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:46,720
ended up when we broke up i say broke up

355
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:48,319
because it was literally like when our

356
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,680
partnership broke up like we had to tr

357
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,600
you had to split equipment down the

358
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:54,159
middle and and all kinds of stuff it was

359
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,399
literally like a breakup

360
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:58,719
but i got the babies and he got half the

361
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,240
babies and then you know we we went our

362
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,240
separate ways

363
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,919
and so that's when uh queen hayes was

364
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,959
born

365
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:09,439
so that was the first staple strain that

366
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:11,518
made canna queen a name yes that is my

367
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,360
legacy strain for my company and what

368
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:16,000
was the cross on that

369
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:18,800
the cross on queen my haze is autoblanco

370
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,519
by bodhi which is the white times wookie

371
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:24,479
times miami heat which is exotic i mean

372
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:26,480
yeah exotics genetics and it is triple o

373
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,800
g times miami haze

374
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:31,278
oh very nice it was true to my roots so

375
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:32,879
you know i just knew that it was going

376
00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:34,480
to be you know

377
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:36,159
originally it was supposed to be like a

378
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,920
white version of the black cave but i

379
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:41,199
really brought it more towards the og

380
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:42,879
side so it became more an og than i hate

381
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,879
but i would tell people in the beginning

382
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:46,639
the f ones and the f twos it was an og

383
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:49,039
haze all the way you'd find ogs you find

384
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:51,519
hazel you find og's with haze high and

385
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:52,559
you find hazel's og high it was kind of

386
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,039
cool

387
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:56,799
right and you know when i first heard

388
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:58,958
the name canna queen that was the first

389
00:12:56,799 --> 00:13:01,519
strain that was for the first type of

390
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:03,199
cannabis that was thrown out there um to

391
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,560
represent you was everybody was saying

392
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,800
grow the queen white grow the queen

393
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:09,199
white grow the green light and uh i'm

394
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:11,120
going okay well maybe i'll pay a bit

395
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,720
more attention to this gal she's

396
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,240
obviously got something going on that

397
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,000
people love

398
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,079
what what's the flowering time like on

399
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,958
that you said it lean closer to the og

400
00:13:18,078 --> 00:13:20,799
right

401
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:22,719
yeah it does lead to close to the og and

402
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:25,039
the flowering times are i mean i've seen

403
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:29,360
one harvest at 56 days

404
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:31,278
64 days 70 days um but mostly between 60

405
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,919
and 70 days is your sweet i feel like

406
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:36,480
cloudy half amber 20. definitely yeah

407
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:38,479
definitely leading towards that og side

408
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:41,120
that's a beautiful flower

409
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,720
it is it's so frosty like she definitely

410
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,399
lives up to her name like everything

411
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,839
about her except for the haze but the

412
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,559
high does come out and some of the

413
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:50,000
phenos the haze high but uh yeah

414
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:52,799
especially she's definitely more of a

415
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,759
heavier high and then like i sing on the

416
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:57,278
cake the um the trichomes is the icing

417
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:59,919
on the cake because when you press her

418
00:13:57,278 --> 00:14:01,039
she'll give you a 30 or 32 return like

419
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:03,120
every time

420
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:05,360
every time yeah that's beautiful and

421
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,399
what's the terp profile like on her

422
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:11,759
so

423
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:14,000
i have f1 f2 f3 v2 and bx1 but when when

424
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:16,399
you get to the x1

425
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,120
it is i locked in that piney

426
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:21,519
lemony like um like it's like almost

427
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:24,639
like murphy's oil there's some that have

428
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:26,000
like a like a burnt rubber tire um terp

429
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,079
to it so

430
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,559
yeah it's pretty big

431
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:32,559
one of the things that i like asking all

432
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:34,719
the people that i interview or all the

433
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:35,599
breeders i should say that i interview

434
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,879
um

435
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,720
is what top three to five strains best

436
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:42,720
represent your company and what you're

437
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,399
trying to accomplish obviously that

438
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,120
queen white haze you said that is the

439
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:49,360
staple of canna queen uh genetics is

440
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,600
there any others that just you're really

441
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,759
trying to promote and put out there

442
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,720
so i'm just gonna say like as far as

443
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:58,399
like crowd favorites um the crowd

444
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,399
favorites are definitely definitely

445
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:02,000
queen white haze number one uh lemon

446
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:04,240
delight number two

447
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,480
uh blue tree stars probably number three

448
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,959
uh three little nightingales

449
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:11,120
oh it's so hard that nightingale was one

450
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:13,518
that you made with the breeder over in

451
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:16,399
spain yeah the three little nightingales

452
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:18,480
with an f3 of his strain the nightingale

453
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:20,559
so you recreated that

454
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,879
and took your i made that train out of

455
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:24,559
my selection yeah and i changed the name

456
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:27,198
because i don't good i don't think it's

457
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:28,719
right when you stomp on and i say stomp

458
00:15:27,198 --> 00:15:30,399
on but you could be making it better or

459
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,959
making it worse you don't know until you

460
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:35,679
you know into the progeny but

461
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:38,638
it deserves a new title like i always

462
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:40,958
stay true to the strained lineages it's

463
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:43,519
somewhere in the name you know so

464
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:45,679
what about that lemon delight what's

465
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:47,839
the lineage on that one

466
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:50,399
okay so lemon delight

467
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:52,240
is uh it's a queen's treat actually

468
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:54,480
that's what i named you know that's what

469
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,959
the name is about but it's lemon right

470
00:15:54,480 --> 00:16:01,680
now by swamp boys which is

471
00:15:56,958 --> 00:16:01,679
lemon tree times gmo tk skunk

472
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:05,919
that's nice yeah it's very nice yeah i

473
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,240
would i would have to say that if you

474
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:10,559
like a longer flowering one she's you

475
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,480
know for you she's probably a 12 to 14

476
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:14,958
weaker just depending on what female

477
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:17,199
we're all about

478
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:19,838
yeah but i'm talking like lemon tree all

479
00:16:17,198 --> 00:16:21,519
day long like fresh lemonade stand grind

480
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:23,920
like i don't know she's just phenomenal

481
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:25,198
but there's also like a gmo pheno that

482
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:26,879
they love

483
00:16:25,198 --> 00:16:29,679
lefty's farm

484
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:33,278
uh did a collab with me

485
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:35,198
um on operations bro season two they did

486
00:16:33,278 --> 00:16:36,799
a blind girl and they found out what

487
00:16:35,198 --> 00:16:38,879
strain they were growing halfway through

488
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:39,919
so it ended up being the lemon delight

489
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:42,879
f2

490
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:45,439
and lefty had at the time was doing um a

491
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:47,039
phenomena of the tkno5 haze by ak

492
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,680
beanbrain

493
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:50,838
and he hit his best lemon delight with

494
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:53,198
the

495
00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:55,839

daylight i'm like oh my gosh so i have

526
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:59,440
never in my life had to smoke cbd to

527
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:01,519
come down from flower ever in my entire

528
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,120
life so i knew something was up at this

529
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:04,480
street i didn't touch it for a whole

530
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:06,079
month after that so

531
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,519
it was caring and i was telling all my

532
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:09,199
people i'm like nope stay away from that

533
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:10,639
that's messed up that strain is messed

534
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,400
up you know

535
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,919
and so it kind of stuck you know and

536
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,600
then they all wanted it they're like we

537
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:16,960
want to grow i'm like no i just need to

538
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:18,879
come with a disclaimer like if you have

539
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:21,679
heart problems this strain is not okay

540
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:23,840
for you i feel like it's

541
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:25,200
it sounds like tyson trying to say

542
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:28,319
messed up

543
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,319
yeah yeah definitely

544
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,679
it's funny that you brought that up

545
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:39,759
about taking cbd to bring you down from

546
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:40,640
a strain um a lot of people have their

547
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:43,839
you know

548
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:45,919
withholdings about cbd and its efficacy

549
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:48,879
but one of the things about cbd is it

550
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:51,038
needs that thc with it in order to

551
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:53,600
activate in order to touch those

552
00:18:51,038 --> 00:18:55,200
receptors and be effective right

553
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:57,678
so yeah the entourage effect you know

554
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:00,000
the t the cbd piggy backs on the thc and

555
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:02,720
vice versa so they don't really work as

556
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,319
well without the other um but there's a

557
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,120
few things you can do if you get too

558
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:07,359
high

559
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:08,798
you can chug a beer because like alcohol

560
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:11,038
is a depressant so if you're like really

561
00:19:08,798 --> 00:19:12,879
really high and you you're freaking out

562
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:14,640
because you know a lot of people

563
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,760
aren't used to this medical grade stuff

564
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,280
you know what i mean like they're like

565
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:19,119
what what'd you do to it it was fine

566
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:21,359
before like it's too strong that stuff

567
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:23,119
hits different now

568
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:24,399
um so you can chug a beer or you can

569
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:26,399
smell pepper

570
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,080
pepper does something to your brain

571
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,759
where i i can't really under i'm like

572
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:33,199
i'm like not a scientist it must be that

573
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:35,599
karyo filing it has to be so

574
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:38,798
yep pepper and then um

575
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:41,439
cbd and people just they just shun cbd

576
00:19:38,798 --> 00:19:43,759
like oh never nothing without pepper

577
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,840
yeah definitely

578
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:47,599
you know what's funny about that

579
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:50,480
we're doing an event in seattle at

580
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:52,480
hempfest and there was a booth there

581
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:55,360
that sold cbd

582
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:58,160
like i don't know if it was isolated or

583
00:19:55,359 --> 00:20:00,558
it would said full spectrum um but

584
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:03,038
hipfest doesn't allow you know any thc

585
00:20:00,558 --> 00:20:05,519
over there but he had these cbd dabs and

586
00:20:03,038 --> 00:20:06,960
then he had extract terpenes so you

587
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:08,960
could add

588
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,159
whatever flavor profile you want to the

589
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,960
cbd

590
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:14,559
and right before that miss c and i had

591
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,558
we were passing around this big old one

592
00:20:14,558 --> 00:20:19,279
ounce joint that i had rolled um and we

593
00:20:16,558 --> 00:20:21,038
were sharing it three coved days and we

594
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:22,720
were just high as [ __ ] it was amazing

595
00:20:21,038 --> 00:20:25,200
and i was with my brother that doesn't

596
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:27,759
smoke cannabis at all like he's never

597
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,440
done a drug in his life so we're just

598
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:30,879
ripped on this one ounce joint and then

599
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,840
we go to this booth and i said well i'll

600
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:35,840
try the cbd dab we sat down he had a

601
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:37,599
little e-nail on it we put the isola in

602
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:39,199
there we picked my terpenes i think it

603
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:41,519
was peach or something like that but i

604
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,558
took just an enormous rip and it was so

605
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:44,319
smooth

606
00:20:42,558 --> 00:20:45,918
that i just kept puffing on it kept

607
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:47,599
popping on it i was fine and then i

608
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:48,400
stood up and he's like well what do you

609
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:49,599
think

610
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,120
and i said

611
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:53,119
it sucks

612
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:55,439
and he goes what do you mean it sucks it

613
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:56,558
looks like he enjoyed it i said i'm not

614
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,400
high

615
00:20:56,558 --> 00:21:02,798
at all i smoked a one ounce [ __ ]

616
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:05,440
joint and you just made me waste it

617
00:21:02,798 --> 00:21:08,798
so that that's my testimony to how well

618
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:10,320
cbd can work it's just how you use it

619
00:21:08,798 --> 00:21:12,400
yeah so i just looked it up real quick

620
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:13,839
about the pepper and it says it's not an

621
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,000
old wives tale

622
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:17,918
if you're battling a bit of thc induced

623
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,480
anxiety paranoia your body suggests

624
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:22,880
sniffing or chewing on black peppercorns

625
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,400
a few sniffs immediate effect while

626
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,240
chewing peppercorns could provide a

627
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,159
relief for about an hour

628
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:31,519
so that's really cool oh wow

629
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:34,480
up to an hour that's actually

630
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:34,480
sniffing some pepper

631
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:40,158
very nice all right we're gonna take a

632
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:40,158
short break

633
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:45,679
for on a short break i want to give a

634
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:47,200
quick shout out to diamond cut company

00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:55,519
since making the switch over to diamond

639
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:58,960
kit company i have not

640
00:21:55,519 --> 00:22:01,200
wanted to use anything else they meet

641
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,798
and exceed every expectation that i have

642
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,798
in a trim so there's some of the most

643
00:22:02,798 --> 00:22:07,038
beautiful trimming scissors ever they're

644
00:22:04,798 --> 00:22:08,879
like a piece of jewelry

645
00:22:07,038 --> 00:22:10,400
and they keep their edge forever as long

646
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,559
as you keep them clean they have tons of

647
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,880
different models the classics which i

648
00:22:12,558 --> 00:22:17,279
use to chop up my buds i prefer not to

649
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:19,520
use a grinder when i'm rolling a blunt i

650
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:21,918
prefer of course to grind so i use the

651
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:24,558
classics to chop up my butt they also

652
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:28,000
have the 6'5 which incorporates the

653
00:22:24,558 --> 00:22:30,480
finger loop and it is spring as well i

654
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:33,038
use those as my general handyman

655
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:35,679
scissors they also have the pros which

656
00:22:33,038 --> 00:22:38,158
have a rounded and grip and a heavier

657
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:40,798
spring and i can actually use those for

658
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:42,640
physically taking down smaller plants

659
00:22:40,798 --> 00:22:45,359
anything from like a one to three gallon

660
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:48,000
they usually seem to be pretty well with

661
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:49,599
um as well as de-stemming before the

662
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,279
trimming process

663
00:22:49,599 --> 00:22:53,599
my favorite model though is the

664
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:56,399
harvester they come in both gold and

665
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:58,319
silver they're springless so you can

666
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,080
trim it as fast as your hand will fly

667
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:03,439
and since there's no resistance against

668
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:05,519
your hand it also means less fatigue and

669
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:07,919
longer trimming time

670
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:09,759
miss c's favorite model is the artisan

671
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:12,400
the artisan does have a spring and it's

672
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:14,240
very comparable to a lot of the

673
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,480
top-of-the-line models

674
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:18,960
that most companies use but i find that

675
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,640
the artisans have a lighter spring which

676
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,960
again leads to

677
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,840
less canned fatigue and longer trimming

678
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,159
time

679
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:28,158
as well as a more comfortable grip and a

680
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:30,559
sharper edge

681
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:32,640
so one last time shout out to diamond

682
00:23:30,558 --> 00:23:35,759

683

a young age her experiences getting into

692
00:23:56,079 --> 00:23:59,359
growing and how she got introduced to

693
00:23:58,319 --> 00:24:01,439
breeding

694
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:03,519
we also talked about some strains that

695
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,519
best represent her company and she was

696
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:08,000

i

705
00:24:20,798 --> 00:24:24,079
i can't say what didn't happen with

706
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,759
canada queen genetics but i would like

707
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:29,278
to think that

708
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:31,519
we will be operating somewhere in a huge

709
00:24:29,278 --> 00:24:33,200
field of dreams with warehouses full of

710
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:34,879
magic

711
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:37,440
everybody wants that

712
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:39,278
exactly um but for now

713
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:41,200
i'm just forwarding working these lines

714
00:24:39,278 --> 00:24:43,359
like really just putting in the putting

715
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,519
in the work and um eventually you know

716
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:47,519
my my strains would be my talking for me

717
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:50,079
and we'll see where that takes us but i

718
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:53,679
am actually explaining

719
00:24:50,079 --> 00:24:57,278
the triplex candy and the xxx candy was

720
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:58,798
a special project i had gotten some

721
00:24:57,278 --> 00:25:01,599
pollen from a friend

722
00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:03,839
of the doll forbidden candy is

723
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:06,798
aficionado aficionado strain it's a

724
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:10,319
skittles times royal kush times highland

725
00:25:06,798 --> 00:25:12,798
afghani super hashy super fruity

726
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:15,599
beautiful plant so i hit

727
00:25:12,798 --> 00:25:18,158
the x18 times the white by white buffalo

728
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:19,678
sea company with it and i created the

729
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:22,000
xxx candy

730
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:24,240
the male was the most impressive

731
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,200
impressive plant i've almost ever seen

732
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,880
he was

733
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,960
he was covered in trichomes he was

734
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:31,440
colorful he definitely had more of a

735
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:33,200
skittles leaf trait but i didn't really

736
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:36,320
see that come through

737
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:38,400
as that as much on in the f2s because

738
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:40,000
they favor the x18

739
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:43,200
nice what colorations were you getting

740
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:46,960
in the fade oranges and burnt umbers and

741
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:49,519
reds and um plums oh it was just

742
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:52,159
phenomenal actually i have it listed on

743
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:52,158
my ig

744
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:57,278
keratin doesn't get enough appreciation

745
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:59,599
everybody loves the the dark purple the

746
00:25:57,278 --> 00:26:01,599
black fades but i've always had like a

747
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:03,359
special place in my heart for the

748
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:04,879
oranges and reds

749
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:06,319
i actually have a special place in my

750
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,679
heart for the males they do not get

751
00:26:06,319 --> 00:26:08,639
enough appreciation they don't get

752
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:11,038
enough

753
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:13,600
face time they don't get enough credit

754
00:26:11,038 --> 00:26:15,200
um yes we need females i think they're

755
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:17,038
obviously important but i think they're

756
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:19,440
not funny that you say that as we're

757
00:26:17,038 --> 00:26:22,720
talking to a female breeder

758
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,679
the males do not get enough respect

759
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,519
and what's

760
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:28,720
is the females in this industry it's

761
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:30,400
vice versa with with like physical life

762
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,000
and this community and industry the

763
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:34,240
females just don't get

764
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,919
the credit that they deserve um and a

765
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:38,240
lot of females just don't even stand

766
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:40,320
stand up they don't stand for it because

767
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:44,079
uh they're intimidated it can be very

768
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:45,839
intimidating to be in a sea full of

769
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:48,158
it's definitely a

770
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:49,519
dominated industry yeah

771
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:51,919
yeah

772
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:54,558
no it's okay it's okay most men are

773
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:56,480
[ __ ] we can throw that out there and

774
00:26:54,558 --> 00:26:57,278
it's not me sticking up for the females

775
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,960
here

776
00:26:57,278 --> 00:26:59,759
i can be an [ __ ]

777
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,600
yeah

778
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:03,519
everybody can be dazzled

779
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:05,678
not not so much [ __ ] but like

780
00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:05,679
they're

781
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:15,200
when i decided this was going to be my

782
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,278
job i was like hell to the yeah i don't

783
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:19,759
have to deal with all these you know

784
00:27:17,278 --> 00:27:23,038
any women like hating me because you

785
00:27:19,759 --> 00:27:24,640
know whatever and then i get that same

786
00:27:23,038 --> 00:27:25,759
thing that i i thought i wasn't gonna

787
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,919
get here

788
00:27:25,759 --> 00:27:30,000
yeah it's just hard to we face a lot of

789
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:31,840
adversity and i'm not i'm not like a

790
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,440
feminist i don't know i'm not like power

791
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:35,359
to the vagina but if you guys would just

792
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:37,360
give us half a [ __ ] chance and you

793
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:38,479
would let us work with you you would see

794
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:40,000
that

795
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,839
we bring something to the table that you

796
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,599
never could we were creating it's

797
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:46,240
definitely something that shouldn't be

798
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:47,439
gender related at all especially when

799
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,480
women

800
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:51,200
naturally

801
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:53,519
pay more attention to things than men do

802
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:55,919
it's those fine details you know that

803
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:58,480
comes with that that whole nature versus

804
00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:01,759
nurture um where i might go into my grow

805
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:03,919
room and say you know oh well you're a

806
00:28:01,759 --> 00:28:05,839
little soggy you know i'll give you or

807
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:07,520
you're a little droopy i'll give you a

808
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:08,879
little bit of water and i'll catch you

809
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:10,960
later

810
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:13,440
miss seal actually like go through and

811
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:15,600
look at him make sure everything's good

812
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,880
um she's kind of like my second pair of

813
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:18,798
eyes and she's a little bit more

814
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,880
detailed than i am and she catches

815
00:28:18,798 --> 00:28:22,798
things that i just don't catch

816
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:25,440
and that you know on that point a lot of

817
00:28:22,798 --> 00:28:27,918
people discredit like for me me for

818
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:30,720
instance because i'm more of a

819
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:32,960
intuitive instinctive type grower and

820
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,880
breeder like even though i'll see two

821
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,558
plants and i'm like yes seemingly you

822
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:39,120
guys are perfect for each other you have

823
00:28:36,558 --> 00:28:41,119
everything but like there's things

824
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:42,879
under recessive things that you cannot

825
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:45,278
see that you could bring up so like even

826
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:47,520
though i do pick the two best plants you

827
00:28:45,278 --> 00:28:49,599
know in my opinion as far as breeding i

828
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:50,798
also go with my second choice that's

829
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:52,240
like in the back of my head like you

830
00:28:50,798 --> 00:28:54,000
should hit those two like they're not

831
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:56,079
perfect but you know what i mean like

832
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,480
and nine times out of ten that second

833
00:28:56,079 --> 00:28:59,199
cross i make that version 2 that i make

834
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:01,278
is

835
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,558
is the one that i end up going with

836
00:29:01,278 --> 00:29:03,759
so

837
00:29:02,558 --> 00:29:05,918
i definitely

838
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:08,798
agree with that i think there's

839
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:11,200
plants that when you smell that terpene

840
00:29:08,798 --> 00:29:13,119
profile it hits certain receptors in

841
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,720
your brain that

842
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:16,639
when they turn you on they make you

843
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:20,000
happy and they make you feel good and

844
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:21,600
you have a good feeling about that plan

845
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,000
that's definitely something that you

846
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:26,000
should investigate further because

847
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,278
obviously there's something about that

848
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,278
whole makeup

849
00:29:27,278 --> 00:29:32,079
of that cannabinoid profile in that

850
00:29:29,278 --> 00:29:33,839
particular phenotype that's just saying

851
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:35,439
it's calling to you

852
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:36,798
yeah i think too with a lot of breeders

853
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,278
they're breeding more towards like their

854
00:29:36,798 --> 00:29:41,440
own their preference only and that's i'm

855
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:44,159
a firm believer in making three versions

856
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:45,919
if you need to of the same cross if if

857
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:47,520
you can if you have the selections i

858
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:49,759
definitely encourage making more than

859
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:51,918
one version because one version could be

860
00:29:49,759 --> 00:29:53,519
for you and one version could be for

861
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:55,520
your mom and one version could be for

862
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:56,879
your sister it's like

863
00:29:55,519 --> 00:29:58,798
i just don't want to single out just

864
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,000
what i want and i think that a lot of

865
00:29:58,798 --> 00:30:01,599
breeders do that and i'm not saying

866
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,720
that's bad i'm just saying maybe that

867
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:06,879
makes me a more thorough breeder when i

868
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:10,480
hit more than just what my selections

869
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:13,840
would be right right i feel like there

870
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:15,679
that is or few and far between um but

871
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:18,240
there is a couple breeders

872
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:19,679
that like isolating oh yeah absolutely

873
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:23,278
i'm for that too

874
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:24,559
i just really love variety so much and i

875
00:30:23,278 --> 00:30:27,679
have a very

876
00:30:24,558 --> 00:30:29,759
a very uh dependable test team so they

877
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:31,519
love it when i send different versions

878
00:30:29,759 --> 00:30:33,440
of the same strain

879
00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:34,879
very nice very nice who who all do you

880
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,798
have on your testing team would you like

881
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:39,360
to give a quick shout out

882
00:30:36,798 --> 00:30:42,000
i actually have about 19

883
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:44,240
of my gardening team i know i know it's

884
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,759
grown over the years i've really built a

885
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:47,679
like a little family

886
00:30:45,759 --> 00:30:49,839
it's really awesome

887
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:53,440
and i'm gonna forget some so i hope they

888
00:30:49,839 --> 00:30:56,480
don't kill me but um smurf and the stone

889
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:57,919
uh wawa canna girls tulkas

890
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,679
69

891
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:00,799
grim smurf banks

892
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:02,880
dubs

893
00:31:00,798 --> 00:31:05,119
i just have so many and they all bring a

894
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:06,480
different factor uh and they're all over

895
00:31:05,119 --> 00:31:08,879
the country too so i have some in

896
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:11,679
scotland i have some in south africa uh

897
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:14,159
shout out delta nine um and and shout

898
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:16,559
out forbidden high teledai farms in

899
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:19,039
scotland so it's really cool to see the

900
00:31:16,558 --> 00:31:21,440
different um phenotypic expressions

901
00:31:19,038 --> 00:31:24,158
especially the south africa he grew the

902
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:26,640
women delight and it i mean

903
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:29,760
black the leaves of the queen i mean the

904
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:32,480
women delight were completely black

905
00:31:29,759 --> 00:31:34,558
it was it's just a stunning plant

906
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:36,960
cool cool and what do you got that

907
00:31:34,558 --> 00:31:39,119
you're working on right now

908
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:41,038
so yeah i kind of got off base but yeah

909
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:43,759
i'm doing the triple x candy

910
00:31:41,038 --> 00:31:44,879
f3's i'm doing the queen white haze back

911
00:31:43,759 --> 00:31:47,440
cross

912
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:49,760
one with the smurf and stone cut

913
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,440
smurf in the stone won the dylan queen's

914
00:31:49,759 --> 00:31:54,079
grow off which was my

915
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,880
my third grow off that i had run on my

916
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:56,720
own

917
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:59,679
and he won with the queen white haze so

918
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:01,919
i used his cut to back cross

919
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:03,440
at f4

920
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:04,320
yeah so that's what i'm working on right

921
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,240
now

922
00:32:04,319 --> 00:32:08,079
very nice and what was it about that cut

923
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:10,079
that just did it for you that you said

924
00:32:08,079 --> 00:32:13,278
this needs to be the backdrop so

925
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:15,038
honestly i wasn't i wasn't that sold on

926
00:32:13,278 --> 00:32:16,640
it just because of how she looked but

927
00:32:15,038 --> 00:32:18,640
she was

928
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:20,080
every time he grew her he grew her like

929
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:22,000
different so he grew her in a greenhouse

930
00:32:20,079 --> 00:32:24,079
and she hit she was like rainbow like

931
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,599
her fade was just rainbow like her bugs

932
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:27,119
have this purple undertone underneath

933
00:32:25,599 --> 00:32:30,079
the leaves is purple

934
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:31,759
um super frosty super dense um but every

935
00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:33,839
time he grew her it was

936
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:35,919
better and better and then the the last

937
00:32:33,839 --> 00:32:38,639
time he grew her she

938
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:40,880
um had like this merlot

939
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:42,320
like almost like a brick red color like

940
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:44,480
oh my gosh she was magnificent i said

941
00:32:42,319 --> 00:32:45,918
you know what smurfs center to me

942
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,759
she's been screaming at me for three

943
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:49,600
years now just said her to me and we'll

944
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:51,759
we'll collab on a back cross oh wow it

945
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:54,000
took three years for you to agree on

946
00:32:51,759 --> 00:32:55,919
that one huh well i wanted to see what

947
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,159
else you know there was a lot of people

948
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:59,840
growing her and there was a lot of

949
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:01,919
different phenos i mean i was seeing the

950
00:32:59,839 --> 00:33:03,918
same ones you know throughout the mix

951
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:05,120
but this was the one that was just like

952
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:08,240
maybe

953
00:33:05,119 --> 00:33:10,879
do you keep your lines pretty open or

954
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:12,720
are you more into bottlenecking into a

955
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,480
certain type it sounds like that you

956
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,399
like your variations so you're trying to

957
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:18,720
keep your lines a little bit more open

958
00:33:16,398 --> 00:33:20,879
but you're giving the people that want

959
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:23,038
the option of the best

960
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:25,360
you know type in your opinion to be able

961
00:33:23,038 --> 00:33:27,679
to select for that too

962
00:33:25,359 --> 00:33:30,479
yeah so uh for a long time i only had

963
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:32,399
about 14 strains released and

964
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:35,038
behind the scenes you know every time i

965
00:33:32,398 --> 00:33:37,518
was flowering i was breeding so i have

966
00:33:35,038 --> 00:33:38,879
about 50 or 55 strains that i've

967
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:42,480
actually created

968
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:44,799
um and i just released 47 of them so

969
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,798
these are strains that some are f2 some

970
00:33:44,798 --> 00:33:48,319
are at f1 somewhere at f4 or so you know

971
00:33:46,798 --> 00:33:50,639
what i mean it just depends on what

972
00:33:48,319 --> 00:33:52,480
strain it is but um everybody there's

973
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:54,480
something for everybody

974
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:56,480
nice very nice what else are you working

975
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:58,159
on that you're you're really stoked

976
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:02,159
about

977
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:03,760
i had gotten some seeds from a friend in

978
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:06,480
the emerald um

979
00:34:03,759 --> 00:34:08,559
i didn't want to call it murder mountain

980
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:10,639
emerald triangle

981
00:34:08,559 --> 00:34:13,918
and he sent me some double energy and

982
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:15,599
i'm literally like i i love og so i

983
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:17,118
popped those i found a male and i found

984
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:19,599
a female of the double og so i did a

985
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:22,079
binary cross i did

986
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:24,480
a male double og to the female queen of

987
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:26,079
haze and then i did a female queen white

988
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:28,079
haze to them

989
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:31,440
vice versa because like i'm dyslexic so

990
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:33,760
like my brain flip-flops it for me

991
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:35,119
anyway i did binary so whichever you

992
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:37,440
know i flipped it with the other cross

993
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:39,119
and so i'm excited about those those are

994
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,760
that we just named the strain it's

995
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:43,200
called lorena del sur which means queen

996
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,079

1016
00:35:23,838 --> 00:35:28,880
absolutely was dying to work with some

1017
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:31,440
kind of skunk some kind of you know

1018
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:33,280
roadkill killstones but not from

1019
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,679
certain people

1020
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:37,280
so i saw bodhi had the roadkill unicorn

1021
00:35:35,679 --> 00:35:39,039
and he crossed it to the wookie and i

1022
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:41,359
was like oh you know i like lookie too

1023
00:35:39,039 --> 00:35:43,279
like he knows the way to my heart

1024
00:35:41,358 --> 00:35:45,838
through his trains

1025
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:48,160
yeah wookie's almost in everything that

1026
00:35:45,838 --> 00:35:49,519
i have like literally it's somehow well

1027
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:51,759
obviously if the queen went hazelnut

1028
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:54,880
wookie's in it you know so

1029
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:55,839
i i had heard about the wookie for a

1030
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:58,320
while

1031
00:35:55,838 --> 00:36:00,880
um and then that name kept popping up

1032
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:02,640
wookie wookie wookie and uh

1033
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:04,400
i'm going a lot of people a lot of

1034
00:36:02,639 --> 00:36:06,078
people think that it's the white times

1035
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,920
cookies which it's not

1036
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:10,160
it's lavender

1037
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:11,599
times appalachia and a lot of people

1038
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:13,440
when they say the white times cookies

1039
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:15,920
i'm like ew why would you do that why

1040
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:17,679
would you even think that

1041
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,800
but i get it like if you just take the w

1042
00:36:17,679 --> 00:36:21,279
and you put cookie you know what i mean

1043
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:23,760
i get it but maybe there is a wookie

1044
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:25,280
cookie but you know not

1045
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,720
not wookie

1046
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,160
right right

1047
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:31,199
yeah we got

1048
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:32,799
to try for the very first time i think

1049
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:35,439
it was the purple look that's what it

1050
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:37,680
was um and i said okay well i finally

1051
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,480
have the opportunity to try some lookie

1052
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:40,559
and

1053
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,920
i didn't know what to expect out of it i

1054
00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:45,119
didn't know that much about it other

1055
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:47,039
than that name kept popping up and after

1056
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:49,039
we smoked the purple wookie i was like

1057
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:51,199
this is something i would grill this is

1058
00:36:49,039 --> 00:36:51,199
beautiful

1059
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:57,359
and the high isn't scamp either like oh

1060
00:36:55,199 --> 00:36:59,838
yeah it's a nice even high

1061
00:36:57,358 --> 00:37:01,838
so okay so purple wookie is roadkill

1062
00:36:59,838 --> 00:37:04,480
unicorn bookie but if you break down

1063
00:37:01,838 --> 00:37:06,320
roadkill unicorn you got roadkill skunk

1064
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:08,079
then you have blackberry widow so that's

1065
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:09,760
where you get all those berries you know

1066
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:11,920
undertones and stuff from and you

1067
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:13,920
definitely get that widow too like that

1068
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,599
i call it halitosis that's the only way

1069
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,280
i can explain it to people who can't

1070
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:19,599
smell it but it's like bad breath like

1071
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:20,880
that's what widow smells like to me

1072
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:23,760
i always thought

1073
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:25,519
to me widow was very like

1074
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:28,000
muskie earth

1075
00:37:25,519 --> 00:37:29,519
yeah i think yeah that could be it could

1076
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,519
be chalked up to earth yeah i guess i

1077
00:37:29,519 --> 00:37:34,159
just i really get like a

1078
00:37:31,519 --> 00:37:36,400
it's not really gmo bad breath

1079
00:37:34,159 --> 00:37:37,519
yeah that's true yeah yeah so true

1080
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,920
that's what i'm saying like i just

1081
00:37:37,519 --> 00:37:41,358
explained it exactly like if it smells

1082
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,720
like a porta potty cake i'm going to

1083
00:37:41,358 --> 00:37:44,000
tell them it smells like a quarter body

1084
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:46,319
kit because

1085
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,239
how old are they gonna like yeah

1086
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:50,240
yeah so your perception out there no

1087
00:37:48,239 --> 00:37:52,159
matter how bad it is and honestly i'm

1088
00:37:50,239 --> 00:37:54,879
one of those people that if the worst

1089
00:37:52,159 --> 00:37:56,399
you make it sound the more i want it

1090
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:58,320
yeah or the more you can relate oh i

1091
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,838
know what a bunt rubber tire smells like

1092
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:01,119
and i know what lemon smells like so if

1093
00:37:59,838 --> 00:38:03,358
i put those two together yes that's

1094
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:04,800
something that i would like

1095
00:38:03,358 --> 00:38:07,598
yeah for sure

1096
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:10,880
i remember i remember being a a younger

1097
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:12,400
punk and uh stealing some of my mom's uh

1098
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:14,720
vodka

1099
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:16,000
and we took a swig off of it and my

1100
00:38:14,719 --> 00:38:18,000
brother goes well what do you think it

1101
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:21,440
tastes like and i said well it tastes

1102
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,639
like [ __ ] tastes like oil lamp oil

1103
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,838
and he goes how do you know what that

1104
00:38:22,639 --> 00:38:26,960
tastes like

1105
00:38:23,838 --> 00:38:28,639
i don't but that's my perception

1106
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,760
so yeah so then when people say that

1107
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:31,759
like how do you know what that smells

1108
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,960
like dude how do you know what it tastes

1109
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,800
like it's like because you can your

1110
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:36,320
smell can translate to taste that's how

1111
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,599
that's why you're given those senses

1112
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:40,079
like
