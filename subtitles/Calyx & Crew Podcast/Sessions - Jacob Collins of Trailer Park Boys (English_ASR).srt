government weed here but it's some Ultra

38
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:19,839

40
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:27,000
yeah if you uh if you had a preference

41
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:29,560
to smoke is there does Jacob have a a

42
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,680
favorite strain favorite type man there

43
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:34,640
was weed around it was it was before

44
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,400
legalization and it was in some of the

45
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:38,238
uh sort of like these black market shops

46
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,959
that were allowed to exist it's like

47
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:40,800
complicated but it was called pinky in

48
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:43,239
the

49
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,439
brain so I don't know my genetics very

50
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:48,080
well but I think like the pink pinks are

51
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:49,519
a realm of weed and I don't know what

52
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,640
this was and I haven't like I've tried

53
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,800
to search it online and saw reference to

54
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:56,958
it but no like not much info about

55
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:59,159
it but like whatever it was it it's it

56
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,360
seemed to be it was like fireworks that

57
00:02:59,158 --> 00:03:02,318
stuff

58
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,159

he had dope

66
00:03:17,318 --> 00:03:22,839
shops [ __ ] what were they called we'll

67
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:25,598
call them gr Market oh Cana something

68
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:27,000
something like that I I can't remember I

69
00:03:25,598 --> 00:03:31,518
was hoping to give it give it another

70
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:34,199
clue there but failed well over a shout

71
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,360
out so how long have you been smoking

72
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:38,560
cannabis

73
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:41,959
Bud gosh I mean since

74
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:45,360
uh since grade

75
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:49,759
11 grade 11 okay so yeah I would have

76
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:53,159
been about I guess 17 then yeah a

77
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:55,759
junior yeah we the same like High School

78
00:03:53,158 --> 00:03:58,199
uh like naming uh conventions that you

79
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:59,359
do with like Junior seniors and such

80
00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:01,000
right so I don't know what I would be

81
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,239
called there but yeah it was the third

82
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,318
year of high school okay but we had five

83
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,959
years scho so that might complicate

84
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:10,039
things do you recall that first

85
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:13,920
experience can we talk about

86
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:17,439
it gosh the first time I ever smoked it

87
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:19,639
was hash at a party and uh my

88
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:20,918
buddy a cook in the restaurant I was

89
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:23,079
also working in the

90
00:04:20,918 --> 00:04:24,639
kitchen like I was young you know

91
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:26,279
underage having a couple beers at this

92
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,360
you know work party and he like sitting

93
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:29,599
there on the couch just pulled out this

94
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,479
chunk of hash I like oo check this out

95
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:35,199
and I had no idea what it was like what

96
00:04:32,478 --> 00:04:37,000
do you got there so we smoked some of

97
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,360
that um I don't really remember how that

98
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,519
went I was already drunk so I might have

99
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:43,479
just like ended up getting you know more

100
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:46,038
more effed up having a couple puffs off

101
00:04:43,478 --> 00:04:48,319
the hash joint but the same dude hooked

102
00:04:46,038 --> 00:04:50,159
me up with some weed after that and that

103
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:53,360
was the first proper time smoking weed

104
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:56,120
was uh or cannabis was you know that

105
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,840
occasion and yeah again not knowing what

106
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:00,240
I was doing I tried me and my buddy went

107
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:02,519
to see this uh band called all at

108
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,280
Carlton University in

109
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:05,599
Ottawa and yeah we didn't even know how

110
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:07,399
to roll joints but we each rolled sort

111
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,199
of like three joints really badly for

112
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:11,758
ourselves out of this you know little

113
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,520
bag of weed we got and I remember was

114
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,000
the uh the what I remember most was

115
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:16,319
sitting like you know three meters apart

116
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,240
from my buddy and we just smoked our

117
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:20,879
three joints solo like in a row you know

118
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,960
not sharing or anything for some reason

119
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:23,759
I don't know why we're sitting so far

120
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:26,399
apart we smoked them all and then like

121
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,400
went to see the

122
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:32,959
concert and strangely I didn't get too

123
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:35,079
high that experience but what year are

124
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:39,279
we talking here this would have been

125
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:40,879
like 92 something like that 1992 okay

126
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:43,799
right oh crap my neighbors mowing their

127
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:47,759
lawn hope it's not too [ __ ] for the

128
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:50,600
audio it's all good man so we can fairly

129
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:53,038
say there wasn't any seeds in that bud I

130
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,600
don't think it was very good weed um

131
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:56,279
because again oddly that was like the

132
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:58,199
one time we got weed back then and it

133
00:05:56,279 --> 00:06:00,198
was only hash for like a year or two

134
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:03,759
which weed was not making it to the

135
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:05,800
Ottawa like you know scene but the hash

136
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,680
was pretty good got to you know learn

137
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,960
about hash smoking hash joints doing

138
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,918
Bottle

139
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:15,000
toes and then we you know eventually did

140
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:17,839
come back onto the scene and uh the rest

141
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:21,519
is history I guess

142
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:23,879
absolutely did that did uh cannabis help

143
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:27,719
play into your acting career at all as

144
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:31,519
far as developing characters

145
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:33,280
or gosh I mean my only acting job has

146
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:34,478
really been like where I've act like

147
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:37,719
other than background work has been on

148
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:40,560
Trailer Park Boys and I mean the Jacob

149
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:43,479
the character I play Jacob Collins is

150
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:46,680
you know also sort of a Stoner you know

151
00:06:43,478 --> 00:06:48,079
kind of slacker type dude well although

152
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:50,759
he does work seven jobs maybe he's not a

153
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:53,000
slacker but sort of slacker Vibes he's

154
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:54,800
constantly working yeah yeah yeah he's

155
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,199
constantly working so it feels wrong

156
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,720
calling him a

157
00:06:56,199 --> 00:07:00,960
slacker um but yeah I mean there there's

158
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,759
certainly some over AP with uh with you

159
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:05,279
know the real Jacob in that regard so I

160
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:08,639
guess you know maybe it would uh I'm

161
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:10,239
able to easily tap into that uh you know

162
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,000
kind of Stoner Vibe yeah so you're

163
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:17,439
saying it's not too far off from the

164
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:20,038
real Jacob not too far at all no if uh

165
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:22,918
if the character Jacob Collins could

166
00:07:20,038 --> 00:07:25,318
make meet Jacob rol separately in a day

167
00:07:22,918 --> 00:07:26,959

trouble low grade trouble what's low

176
00:07:45,158 --> 00:07:49,158
grade

177
00:07:46,598 --> 00:07:52,120
trouble yeah I'm I'm I'm just joking

178
00:07:49,158 --> 00:07:54,839
really I don't get not on the Ricky par

179
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:56,879
not on Ricky par maybe some mild

180
00:07:54,839 --> 00:08:00,560
trespassing you know so when I first

181
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:03,120
started talking to you here

182
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,360
must have been like two years ago now I

183
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,000
saw you post up a picture of two plants

184
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,919
that you had growing in your window

185
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,560
there and I asked you about it and uh

186
00:08:09,918 --> 00:08:13,639
you said yeah you were growing a couple

187
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:17,360
plants there was that your first

188
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:18,879
experience growing or have you grown

189
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:22,919
previously

190
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:26,639
um first time like I remember having a

191
00:08:22,918 --> 00:08:29,359
weed in my window like back in the '90s

192
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,759
some some just bag seed I got and it was

193
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,759
a male plant I had no idea till it

194
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:35,440
started like dumping pollen everywhere

195
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:37,679
like oh this is weird I don't want to

196
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,440
smoke that um but yeah it was just and

197
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:43,199
it was in like a you know it was getting

198
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:45,839
basically no light uh but then in in in

199
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,959
University um I was in my late 20s when

200
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:50,480
I like when this was going on me and my

201
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:52,359
roommates set up a grow room in the

202
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,080
Attic So we had to go up through this

203
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:57,240
cubby hole in one of

204
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,920
the in in one dude's like closet and

205
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,278
then we built a room up in the attic so

206
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:03,759
it would be you know out of sight

207
00:09:01,278 --> 00:09:05,720
uh and yeah like like bought a bunch of

208
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:07,480
equipment and had a hydroponic set up

209
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:09,320
there one of the dudes there had a bit

210
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:11,399
of experience so he was definitely sort

211
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:12,839
of like you know running things but uh

212
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:14,720
like the rest of us helped like lug

213
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:16,720
water and like whatever you know watch

214
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,600
out for the landlord and stuff his name

215
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,600
wasn't Ricky was

216
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:26,040
it oh

217
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:28,120
man I mean it that's pretty insane that

218
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:30,120
that's how it went you know you're doing

219
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:32,720
water in this guy making

220
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:34,560
you knows all the goods it's from the

221
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,720
operation we had some good clones that

222
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:39,278
we got uh and uh we had yeah we know it

223
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,720
worked out well we we got a bunch of

224
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:42,838
good weed at least from like from my

225
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,360
perspective it was H you know probably

226
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:46,760
end up with four to six o each and and

227
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,480
there were four of us so you know it's

228
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:52,600
pretty good for a for a first grow um do

229
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:57,039
you remember what any of those clones

230
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:58,480
were oh gosh no idea yeah no idea at all

231
00:09:57,039 --> 00:10:01,639
I don't really have a head for like

232
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,600
remembering such yeah such details

233
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:05,759
unfortunately so is this something that

234
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,800
you just do on and off in your free time

235
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:10,639
or is this like a I'm gonna grow for

236
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:13,799
myself every year yeah well I mean since

237
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:16,958
living in in that house at at school I

238
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:20,958
guess I never really had um my own

239
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:22,518
place I mean I I had places with like

240
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:23,879
partners and stuff girlfriends but we

241
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:25,519
never had enough room to have a grow

242
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:28,039
room or and you know never thought about

243
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:29,759
like you know I guess actually growing

244
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:31,719
weed

245
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:33,600
but but often I didn't have space to do

246
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:35,560
it and so not until I moved back to Nova

247
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,000
Scotia into this house I'm in now where

248
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:39,599
I've got like a bunch of extra rooms

249
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,799
that I was finally like woohoo I'm gonna

250
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:45,920
like you know grow some weed H yeah and

251
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:48,078
it was so yeah and and and so I did you

252
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:51,120
know got me uh got me some lights and a

253
00:10:48,078 --> 00:10:52,638
little grow tent and uh kind of fumbled

254
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,159
my way through it and so I've been I've

255
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:56,240
just been doing it like you know one or

256
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:58,439
two cycles in the summer is when I'm

257
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,959
here in Canada um I often travel in the

258
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:03,920
winter so I can't like just you know

259
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:05,958
have a constantly rotating crop or

260
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:08,559
anything but I'm it turn it turns out

261
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:12,039
I'm not really good at it at all so it's

262
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:13,838
uh like I enjoy it to a point like when

263
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:15,439
the plants get too like stressed looking

264
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:18,560
it can be sort of a stressful thing to

265
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:21,560
have to deal with like oh man that's my

266
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:23,278
job man is I teach people how to grow

267
00:11:21,559 --> 00:11:25,838
and grow correctly and I don't believe

268
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:29,919
there's a person on this planet that has

269
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:32,959
a brown thumb I think there's unless you

270
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:35,319
know that subject which that's my

271
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:38,399
subject that's all I do is

272
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:40,519
cannabis um unless you know that subject

273
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:43,240
and you get into the details of how to

274
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:46,600
take care of them best and make that

275
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:48,799
kind of like second memory you know um

276
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:50,360
as far as what environment they like

277
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:52,599
what kind of medium they like what

278
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:55,360
nutrition they like little tiny things

279
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:57,879
it gets easier um the more you learn

280
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,440
about it but I'd be happy to help you

281
00:11:57,879 --> 00:12:01,720
with that if you ever run run into

282
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:04,519
problems or anything hit me up I will

283
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:06,120
help you out we'll get you on track well

284
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:07,759
thank you I'll I'll take you up on that

285
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:10,278
I'm not growing this summer I took a

286
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:13,519
this summer off because I've got like a

287
00:12:10,278 --> 00:12:15,039
big backlog of like because I the wheed

288
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:18,240
I grow isn't that great I turn it into

289
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:20,000
weed oil which which is like like

290
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,480
topnotch as far as I'm concerned like

291
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,159
that that stff does the trick great

292
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,480
absolutely so I do like being able to

293
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:25,838
like you know have all this wheed oil

294
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,440
around but I've got so much now that

295
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,920
I've made from previous years and this

296
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,959
summer I'm sort of going and coming

297
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:35,039
traveling more that'd be tough to S of

298
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:36,518
monitor my indoor uh you know setup so

299
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:38,159
anyway I'm not growing this summer but

300
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:42,360
yeah next year I'll get back on the

301
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:44,679
train and uh get some uh get some tips

302
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:47,919
I'm kind of a

303
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:51,599
lazy I I can be lazy sometimes like when

304
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:53,639
it comes to like paying attention in a

305
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,240
sustained way to something so I don't

306
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:58,399
know it could be a character flaw of

307
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,839
mine that's like you know I don't think

308
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,559
so at all

309
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:05,519
it just sounds like you got ADHD and I

310
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:08,000
think 90% of the people in here

311
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,399
do like it is I sort of feel like the

312
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
five years I've been doing it I've been

313
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:13,519
trying to like bring in an extra element

314
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,879
and correct for it like I started off

315
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:16,759
you know with sort of you know just the

316
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:19,360
b super Basics and I you know bring in

317
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:21,240
more like okay I'm gonna get a pH kit

318
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,039
and like next year like okay I'm gonna

319
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:25,159
try to like be better with temperature

320
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:27,838
but I feel like I was getting worse

321
00:13:25,159 --> 00:13:30,639
every year somehow despite like trying

322
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:34,000
to pay attention to more things I think

323
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:36,440
an unspoken part of growing that not a

324
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,919
lot of people mention is there's

325
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:41,639
something spiritual about growing

326
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:44,519
cannabis um just the fact that our

327
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:47,879
systems made to work with it that we

328
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:49,799
have that endoc canabo system is just

329
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:51,879
there's a relationship there that's been

330
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:54,198
around for a very long time and I feel

331
00:13:51,879 --> 00:13:56,759
like the energy that you bring into your

332
00:13:54,198 --> 00:13:58,879
grow room has an effect on your plants

333
00:13:56,759 --> 00:14:01,360
to some degree even if it's just a a

334
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:02,838
little bit um because you can see people

335
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,800
in their daily lives that are really

336
00:14:02,839 --> 00:14:07,160
stressed out and they go in the gr room

337
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:09,240
stressed out every day and oh man it's

338
00:14:07,159 --> 00:14:11,240
not getting any better I'm doing worse

339
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:13,000
and their plants are looking like crap

340
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:14,320
and then there's people that will not go

341
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,519
in their grow room unless they're

342
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:20,199
feeling in the right kind of mood and

343
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:22,759
are doing good in doing well in life and

344
00:14:20,198 --> 00:14:24,879
happy and you can see their Grow rooms

345
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:27,560
proliferating so I've definitely been in

346
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:30,240
both situations myself I've been

347
00:14:27,559 --> 00:14:32,599
stressed out over worked got so much

348
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,600
going on can't focus and my girl room

349
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:36,079
starts looking like crap and then

350
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,560
there's been other times where it's like

351
00:14:36,078 --> 00:14:39,359
okay there's something wrong in the grow

352
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:43,838
room I need to fix it now be on it get

353
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:46,680
it done with and yeah I do I have an

354
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:48,199
avoidant sort go if things do start to

355
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:49,519
go like you know like oh I don't know

356
00:14:48,198 --> 00:14:51,599
like what's wrong with this plant's got

357
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:54,560
some things on the leaf and then I will

358
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:57,159
start to avoid you know my like problems

359
00:14:54,559 --> 00:15:01,119
yeah exactly oh yeah

360
00:14:57,159 --> 00:15:02,600
exactly exactly how I act with that it's

361
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,919
looking like crap I just don't want to

362
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:07,159
deal with it right

363
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:09,879
now so let me ask you really quick uh

364
00:15:07,159 --> 00:15:14,078
what was your how many seasons did you

365
00:15:09,879 --> 00:15:17,039
do 11 no you came in after

366
00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:20,039
Trevor right I was my my my role

367
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:24,439
expanded yeah uh in season seven after

368
00:15:20,039 --> 00:15:26,399
Corey and Trevor left um but I was in it

369
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:28,120
the show from season one I had a small

370
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,879
recurring role where I sort of get fired

371
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:32,919
from job every season yeah okay I was in

372
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:36,480
every season except season six I think

373
00:15:32,919 --> 00:15:38,000
if memory serves um and then I was sort

374
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,120
of there I guess laying in weight when

375
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,639
they're looking for like you know

376
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:46,198
someone to fill the jail cover role um

377
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:48,399
so after all that time what was uh what

378
00:15:46,198 --> 00:15:53,359
was one of your favorite moments

379
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:53,360
filming like in all of Trailer Park Boys

380
00:15:53,600 --> 00:16:01,000
yeah gosh I mean there's been you know

381
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:03,958
it's pretty there's been lots of fun

382
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,120
times like for me it's it's always

383
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:07,439
pretty surreal being on set even at this

384
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:09,039
point like it was in the early years

385
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,440
just being a regular Joe you know

386
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:13,039
working in kitchens and then being you

387
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:14,560
know pulled out and going to like work

388
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:17,519
on Trailer Park Boys or you know be on

389
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:19,638
TV every so often totally not used to

390
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:21,560
it and so it was you know I was always

391
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:23,278
kind of freaky and then like when my RO

392
00:16:21,559 --> 00:16:25,958
expanded and I was on the show a lot

393
00:16:23,278 --> 00:16:27,399
more I got to see how stuff worked and

394
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:28,919
it always remained yeah super kind of

395
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:30,159
surreal and freaky like you know just

396
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:31,879
just cruising around in the back of the

397
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:34,198
ship mobile is you know could be a

398
00:16:31,879 --> 00:16:37,480
pretty good time like the smell of

399
00:16:34,198 --> 00:16:40,958
gasoline wafting you know the the the

400
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:43,720
wind in your hair old garbage from like

401
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:44,919
Seasons past still like hidden around in

402
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:48,000
nooks and

403
00:16:44,919 --> 00:16:49,639
crannies that's awesome but I mean

404
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,519
there's like yeah there there's been so

405
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:54,959
like all the crazy shenanigans that we

406
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:57,560
get up to you know in the episodes like

407
00:16:54,958 --> 00:17:00,198
like [ __ ] around with the horse stuff

408
00:16:57,559 --> 00:17:03,159
was pretty fun

409
00:17:00,198 --> 00:17:05,480
um [ __ ] around in the woods in season

410
00:17:03,159 --> 00:17:09,240
s and because season seven was such a

411
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:11,480
big like change for me like like from

412
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:12,919
just being on set once or twice a year

413
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:15,160
to you know all a sudden being on there

414
00:17:12,919 --> 00:17:17,559
for a whole season like most days and

415
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:20,439
being involved so much in this plot was

416
00:17:17,558 --> 00:17:23,119
uh yeah like like pretty mind-blowing

417
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:24,959
you know and and fun but like all the

418
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:27,078
stuff in the woods when like we crashed

419
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:29,960
the car into the woods and we're like

420
00:17:27,078 --> 00:17:31,839
lost in the woods l the train tracks and

421
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:33,279
you know for the sey express that was

422
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:36,038
you know pretty

423
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:37,759
uh just but I mean there's so many times

424
00:17:36,038 --> 00:17:39,000
and it's almost like the rule as opposed

425
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:41,319
to the exception but it's like you know

426
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,038
this is crazy this is my job like like

427
00:17:41,319 --> 00:17:47,558
what's going on

428
00:17:43,038 --> 00:17:50,720
here I was reading your Reddit AMA

429
00:17:47,558 --> 00:17:52,639
earlier and I saw where you were talking

430
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:55,558
about the shitmobile and it actually

431
00:17:52,640 --> 00:18:00,400
running having to be dropped off by a

432
00:17:55,558 --> 00:18:00,399
flatbed truck jump started every time

433
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:07,038
time funny that's a memory by the uh by

434
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,159
the end I think they still have that

435
00:18:07,038 --> 00:18:10,759
same old one which is like this actual

436
00:18:09,159 --> 00:18:12,159

454
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:55,960

455
00:18:53,640 --> 00:19:00,320
of the shitmobile the door comes off and

456
00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:00,319
on as you know oh my God

457
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:08,558
looking this up right now awes

458
00:19:03,798 --> 00:19:08,558
um what was your least favorite

459
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:15,038
moment I mean I find like moments when I

460
00:19:11,558 --> 00:19:18,038
feel like I didn't

461
00:19:15,038 --> 00:19:20,240
like like nailed the scene properly like

462
00:19:18,038 --> 00:19:22,119
I didn't sort of you act good could be

463
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,839
like pretty nerve-wracking

464
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:26,399
like you know get I get like sort of you

465
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:29,279
know super self-conscious about it if I

466
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,720
feel I yeah couldn't like I guess to

467
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:32,319
deliver the lines in a way that seemed

468
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,038
realistic or you know whatever the case

469
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:34,720
may

470
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:37,839
be

471
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:39,919
um there one scen stick out is a

472
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:41,079
genuinely hard one for you to do one

473
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:44,440
scene that comes to mind was yeah when I

474
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:49,319
was supposed to be acting drunk in a it

475
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:51,480
was in the Don't Legalize It movie and

476
00:19:49,319 --> 00:19:53,879
uh I was supposed to go on a on a

477
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:55,599
mission on the road with the boys in in

478
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:57,320
the movie but then like my dad Phil

479
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:58,558
Collins grounded me basically and told

480
00:19:57,319 --> 00:20:00,279
me I couldn't go so I had to to go and

481
00:19:58,558 --> 00:20:01,879
tell the boys that I couldn't go and I

482
00:20:00,279 --> 00:20:04,079
was you know nervous about it and super

483
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:06,120
drunk and yeah acting drunk like trying

484
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:08,359
to slur your words and like you know I

485
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:10,479
guess be or you know whatever like you

486
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:12,639
know be uh woozy on your feet and that

487
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,319
kind of thing was yeah super hard to

488
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:18,000
execute and I don't think I did it at

489
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:20,279
all oh I bet yeah well if Jacob col or

490
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,599
yeah Jacob Collins comes so natural to

491
00:20:20,279 --> 00:20:25,558
you and then being in a sober state of

492
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:27,719
mind trying to portray yourself in a

493
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:28,918
drunken state of mind that would be

494
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:31,400
pretty

495
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:34,159
difficult yeah I'm no uh I'm know John

496
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:37,280
John dunsworth that's for

497
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:40,440
sure he was yeah he was amazing and I

498
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:42,720
think I I heard that he was not much of

499
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:45,558
a drinker at all in real life is that

500
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:47,360
true yeah that's uh that's that's my

501
00:20:45,558 --> 00:20:48,960
understanding and yeah he could turn on

502
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:52,599
and turn off the like yeah you know

503
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:57,038
super super drunken state it seemed you

504
00:20:52,599 --> 00:20:59,558
on on demand it's incredible um if I had

505
00:20:57,038 --> 00:21:03,319
to ask you like your top three

506
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:06,678
influences when it came to acting uh who

507
00:21:03,319 --> 00:21:08,918
would you shat out my top three

508
00:21:06,679 --> 00:21:11,840
influences

509
00:21:08,919 --> 00:21:15,200
yeah gosh you know I don't

510
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:17,038
have like like my approach to acting

511
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,400
like I I'm not like I don't really see

512
00:21:17,038 --> 00:21:20,359
myself as acting I'm just sort of like

513
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:23,038
you know doing this the stuff in front

514
00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:25,719
of the camera but like I don't

515
00:21:23,038 --> 00:21:29,359
have like sort of Role Models or that

516
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:31,319
kind of thing uh um or like actors who I

517
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:34,759
sort of aspire to be

518
00:21:31,319 --> 00:21:38,678
like how about art

519
00:21:34,759 --> 00:21:41,679
influencers yeah for art that's uh like

520
00:21:38,679 --> 00:21:43,120
I um Robert crumb would be one I I I

521
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:46,320
really liked his stuff like when I was

522
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:47,879
growing up my dad had some arrum like uh

523
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:49,558

524
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:54,320
around

525
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:57,119
uh and like the Psychedelic kind of um

526
00:21:54,319 --> 00:22:01,119
music posters of the you know 60s and

527
00:21:57,119 --> 00:22:04,959
70s I liked a lot oh wow so uh like like

528
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:07,319
Peter Max he's an artist who did like uh

529
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:10,480
I think posters like in the more in the

530
00:22:07,319 --> 00:22:12,599
60s maybe like Led Zeppelin some sort of

531
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,839
okay you know bands like that but like

532
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:17,918
an early sort

533
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:20,480
of really trippy screen prints uh nice

534
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:22,480
stuff what's another don't remember his

535
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,798

536
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:26,480
it to you later but there was a guy that

537
00:22:24,798 --> 00:22:29,359

539
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:34,399
back in the day yeah yeah yeah I I know

540
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:36,038
the style yeah that's totally Peter Max

541
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,640
style I don't know if Peter Max did like

542
00:22:36,038 --> 00:22:40,720
NES stuff but it almost like could have

543
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:44,320
been like a similar very similar yeah

544
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:46,640
the alien landscape kind of but like and

545
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:48,519
yeah like nice and colorful real trippy

546
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,960
stuff I always love that we've been

547
00:22:48,519 --> 00:22:52,679
talking about that art in our server uh

548
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,720
here for a while now just the other day

549
00:22:52,679 --> 00:22:58,240
we were talking about heavy metal uh the

550
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:59,640
old movie that they had put on on the

551
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:04,000
artwork that was in there that was

552
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:07,120
really cool yeah uh was there any times

553
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:11,038
when you guys were filming scene where

554
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:11,038
it led to actual real

555
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:17,000
trouble

556
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:17,000
um gosh real

557
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:25,159
trouble once once the cops had to get

558
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,880
called because uh one of the background

559
00:23:25,159 --> 00:23:28,880
performers had some

560
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,278
handcuffs that they didn't have a key

561
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:33,278
for they were they were real police

562
00:23:30,278 --> 00:23:35,400
handcuffs it turns out which real I

563
00:23:33,278 --> 00:23:37,798
guess non- cops aren't allowed to have

564
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:39,480
civilians it it turns out but I guess

565
00:23:37,798 --> 00:23:40,918
they were in like the props you know

566
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:43,319
whatever like

567
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:45,400
kit and this background guy wasn't

568
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:46,839
supposed to be handcuffing anybody but

569
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:49,960
just like like the way the scene played

570
00:23:46,839 --> 00:23:52,759
out he you know he was with with Julian

571
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:55,159
JP and I put the handcuffs on

572
00:23:52,759 --> 00:23:56,679
him and then they they couldn't get him

573
00:23:55,159 --> 00:23:58,520
off you know when when the scene was

574
00:23:56,679 --> 00:24:00,480
done time to get ready for the next take

575
00:23:58,519 --> 00:24:02,720
and so you know after a bunch of like

576
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:05,038
holy [ __ ] what do we do they had to call

577
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:07,519
the cops to come in and use their you

578
00:24:05,038 --> 00:24:09,519
know cop keys to get the uh the

579
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:12,679
handcuffs off and of course the cops

580
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:14,599
were curious as to you know why you know

581
00:24:12,679 --> 00:24:17,440
why

582
00:24:14,599 --> 00:24:19,399
the is logging you up with some actual

583
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,480
handcuffs I think in the end the cops

584
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:24,320
are just like don't do that again but

585
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:26,599
let them keep keep the Cuffs if I recall

586
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:28,278
don't don't quote me on that cool that's

587
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:30,439
cool they were cool about but they were

588
00:24:28,278 --> 00:24:33,679

00:25:16,759 --> 00:25:20,440
that's here to

608
00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:26,000
judge

609
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:26,000
so um how did they portray cannabis on

610
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:34,440
scene on um I mean it

611
00:25:31,558 --> 00:25:36,678
was there was plenty of times where they

612
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:39,880
had grows going or you guys had bags of

613
00:25:36,679 --> 00:25:41,200
weed yeah like yeah I was just thinking

614
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:43,000
about like how to how to describe it it

615
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:45,240
was like sort of glorified but also you

616
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:48,599
know the dangers with the law were also

617
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:51,759
certainly you know made evident uh on

618
00:25:48,599 --> 00:25:56,558
the show um but yeah I mean it was seen

619
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:56,558
as something that was you know that uh I

620
00:25:56,679 --> 00:26:02,559
guess huh yeah how was it portrayed like

621
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:05,000
what what's your opinion on that was it

622
00:26:02,558 --> 00:26:07,200
like uh what were they using

623
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:10,079
to that you guys were walking around

624
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:12,480
with to oh that oh yeah yeah just like

625
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:14,000
fake green stuff basically like like

626
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:17,440
other other herbs some sort of herbal

627
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,640
mix they would have bags of for like

628
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,038
like when when we're smoking joints it

629
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,278
would just be some sort of like herbal

630
00:26:20,038 --> 00:26:25,000
mix but it was

631
00:26:22,278 --> 00:26:26,079
disgusting like there's you know Blends

632
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,919
out there that are you know can be

633
00:26:26,079 --> 00:26:29,480
pleasant to smoke like with you know

634
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:31,759
this and that and it I don't know

635
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:34,159
anything about herbal mixes but I don't

636
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:37,558
know if there is going for a budget like

637
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:38,880
using like a legal herb mix yeah a bunch

638
00:26:37,558 --> 00:26:41,038
of legal herbs and then when they had

639
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:43,520
like like Buds and like fake weeds or

640
00:26:41,038 --> 00:26:44,879
plants they'd be these when like often

641
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:47,679
when you saw Out close it'd be real sort

642
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:49,960
of like gangly looking not very

643
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:51,798
realistic but at a distance or you know

644
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:55,240
for set decoration it would it would it

645
00:26:51,798 --> 00:26:56,440
would pass as weed plants right I guess

646
00:26:55,240 --> 00:27:00,440
some were better than others depending

647
00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:01,679
on like what resources they had and uh

648
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:04,919
yeah I guess what was going on in the

649
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:07,880
scene um but yeah it was like weird

650
00:27:04,919 --> 00:27:10,278
random like just like weird fake plant

651
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:11,880
stuff or even like Styrofoam kind of

652
00:27:10,278 --> 00:27:13,480
foam stuff that' be spray painted to

653
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:16,039
look like

654
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:18,519
weed they portrayed it pretty well when

655
00:27:16,038 --> 00:27:20,319
the I there was a time when uh Ricky

656
00:27:18,519 --> 00:27:23,440
Julian and Bubbles were in a field of

657
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:26,519
marijuana that must have been real weed

658
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:28,278
yeah yeah think they did I've also

659
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:29,798
wondered I don't know if they knew

660
00:27:28,278 --> 00:27:32,278
people who had a grow operation or if it

661
00:27:29,798 --> 00:27:35,639
was maybe a hemp some sort of hemp like

662
00:27:32,278 --> 00:27:39,240
feel if they had those here yeah like

663
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:43,720
the scenes with reita mcneel uh it look

664
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:46,079
like a real weed field to me so we

665
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:48,640
haven't got to touch much on your art

666
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:50,240
yet uh people some of these people don't

667
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:53,320
know that you're a very accomplished

668
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:55,640
Artist as well um when did you start

669
00:27:53,319 --> 00:27:55,639

they made a third jail season just back

756
00:31:28,759 --> 00:31:34,679
in April of this year a few months ago

757
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:36,840
and I was in for a few days on that and

758
00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:39,399
so yes so was good to see the gang and

759
00:31:36,839 --> 00:31:41,158
you know so yeah like with the jail

760
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:42,959
stuff it's mostly the boys in jail and

761
00:31:41,159 --> 00:31:44,799
it's sort of different main secondary

762
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:48,919
cast but there were a few scenes with me

763
00:31:44,798 --> 00:31:51,079

765
00:31:51,079 --> 00:31:55,199
alive in the

766
00:31:52,679 --> 00:31:58,038
background um and there's plans for

767
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:59,840
another season in the park next next I

768
00:31:58,038 --> 00:32:01,079
think next year is the current like time

769
00:31:59,839 --> 00:32:03,599
when it's like they're saying it's going

770
00:32:01,079 --> 00:32:04,638
to happen like all through Co I kept

771
00:32:03,599 --> 00:32:06,119
saying like oh yeah we're hoping to do

772
00:32:04,638 --> 00:32:09,638
it this year hoping to do it this year

773
00:32:06,119 --> 00:32:12,879
so there is a plan I I I don't doubt but

774
00:32:09,638 --> 00:32:15,319
um I'm not exactly holding my

775
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:17,200
breath okay but there is a there is a

776
00:32:15,319 --> 00:32:19,158

spot Bran Bran you were always one of my

784
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:38,919
favorite characters especially uh when

you started impersonating Julian that

786
00:32:38,919 --> 00:32:42,799
[ __ ] just cracked me up the first time

787
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:45,240
that they pulled up on you and you were

788
00:32:42,798 --> 00:32:48,359

00:32:52,278 --> 00:32:57,159
one the

792
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:00,558
obsession what would have been some some

793
00:32:57,159 --> 00:33:01,559
of your favorite extra scenes that

794
00:33:00,558 --> 00:33:04,200
you've

795
00:33:01,558 --> 00:33:07,000
done I know you've done multiple shows

796
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:08,960
that people might not even freaking know

797
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:12,240
uh you did some with like I said vgo

798
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:14,679
morson earlier um you did a bunch of

799
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:17,000
extra zombie work what was some of your

800
00:33:14,679 --> 00:33:19,000
favorite extra work to do yeah the the

801
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:22,359
zombie stuff would definitely be the

802
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:24,558
funnest uh and you know what what like

803
00:33:22,359 --> 00:33:26,119
the the standout background work

804
00:33:24,558 --> 00:33:28,119
especially when I was getting like you

805
00:33:26,119 --> 00:33:31,199
know full make up and like Prosthetics

806
00:33:28,119 --> 00:33:32,839
and stuff so you know looking like super

807
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:35,639
you know super super

808
00:33:32,839 --> 00:33:38,519
zombie and I was in a number of zombie

809
00:33:35,638 --> 00:33:40,798
movies I was I was living close to

810
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:41,919
Toronto like in the early 2000s when

811
00:33:40,798 --> 00:33:45,158
they were filming a bunch of zombie

812
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:46,919
movies it was like the zombie

813
00:33:45,159 --> 00:33:49,440
Renaissance so I happen to be in the

814
00:33:46,919 --> 00:33:50,639
right place at the right time for a well

815
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,840
and basically if you wanted like it was

816
00:33:50,638 --> 00:33:55,839

line I mean they' always keep my lines

839
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:55,759
kind of like kind of limited like

840
00:34:53,358 --> 00:34:57,400
knowing my knowing the the the

841
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:59,320
limitations of my acting abil ility like

842
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:01,960
I I never got Giants giant you know

843
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:06,200
chunks of uh you

844
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:09,199
know lines to uh to memorize and

845
00:35:06,199 --> 00:35:11,480
read but yes it's funny like I'm I'm

846
00:35:09,199 --> 00:35:13,078
totally drawing a blank on that uh on

847
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:15,679
that

848
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:18,839
question when what was there a

849
00:35:15,679 --> 00:35:20,480
particular scene that came to you and

850
00:35:18,838 --> 00:35:22,440
you could just automatically do it you

851
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:25,559
had no trouble with it and you came out

852
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:27,960
of it going I [ __ ] nailed

853
00:35:25,559 --> 00:35:31,960
that I mean a lot of the scenes are

854
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:34,960
pretty casual sort of like hanging out

855
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:35,838
and you know I don't like [ __ ] around

856
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,519
I

857
00:35:35,838 --> 00:35:40,039
guess

858
00:35:37,519 --> 00:35:42,838
um you know I I would really do well to

859
00:35:40,039 --> 00:35:44,639
watch watch the series again to almost

860
00:35:42,838 --> 00:35:47,119
reacquaint myself with all all the stuff

861
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:50,118
that happened I'm uh I haven't seen the

862
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:53,079
whole series in probably over 10

863
00:35:50,119 --> 00:35:55,680
years um so it's been a

864
00:35:53,079 --> 00:35:57,400
while so you don't go back and rewatch

865
00:35:55,679 --> 00:36:00,239
much of your own work

866
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:01,680
no no I mean often I find it like like a

867
00:36:00,239 --> 00:36:03,598
I don't like watching my scenes

868
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:05,318
necessarily like often it's fine but if

869
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:09,160
if the ones where I feel I was like that

870
00:36:05,318 --> 00:36:12,318
were you know poorly executed like like

871
00:36:09,159 --> 00:36:14,838
I can cringe like like the rest of them

872
00:36:12,318 --> 00:36:18,440
but yeah no no no I haven't seen it uh

873
00:36:14,838 --> 00:36:21,719
in ages I did watch season uh like

874
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:23,880
season five a couple of winters ago and

875
00:36:21,719 --> 00:36:26,358
uh like you laugh my ass off it was it

876
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:29,039
was great um what brought you back to

877
00:36:26,358 --> 00:36:30,519
season five it was just one that I

878
00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:35,159
wasn't I think it was one of the earlier

879
00:36:30,519 --> 00:36:37,559
ones I was least least familiar with uh

880
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:39,719
and so I just happened to like you know

881
00:36:37,559 --> 00:36:41,679
hit play on on Netflix on that one so

882
00:36:39,719 --> 00:36:44,358
yeah nothing in particular brought me to

883
00:36:41,679 --> 00:36:46,679
it that's got to be surreal watching

884
00:36:44,358 --> 00:36:49,920
yourself on

885
00:36:46,679 --> 00:36:51,799
TV it is yeah

886
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:54,119
it's it's

887
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:56,318
strange I don't if I really like yeah

888
00:36:54,119 --> 00:36:58,599
register it necessarily like what do you

889
00:36:56,318 --> 00:37:00,039
think young Jacob rol would have said if

890
00:36:58,599 --> 00:37:03,760
I would have told him hey you're going

891
00:37:00,039 --> 00:37:03,759
to be a pretty famous

892
00:37:05,079 --> 00:37:10,039
actor

893
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:12,150
um yeah he might have been uh he'd

894
00:37:10,039 --> 00:37:16,519
probably be like right

895
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:16,519
[Laughter]

896
00:37:17,679 --> 00:37:24,199
on Al

897
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:26,280
I that's so real though Park Bo famous

898
00:37:24,199 --> 00:37:27,399
is a special kind of yeah sort of micro

899
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,640
uh

900
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:31,480
micro

901
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:33,279
Fame although it's it's been great like

902
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:36,719
I've been n like it's it i' I've

903
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:40,240
benefited from it obviously like

904
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:41,759
wonderfully um like like most of the art

905
00:37:40,239 --> 00:37:44,039
I was I was doing screen printing for a

906
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,359
while alongside Trailer Park Boys and

907
00:37:44,039 --> 00:37:47,039
just started doing trailer park boys

908
00:37:45,358 --> 00:37:50,679
theme prints like maybe three four years

909
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:53,119
ago it was maybe a year before covid but

910
00:37:50,679 --> 00:37:57,519
they're by far my like yeah bestselling

911
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:59,599
stuff and so it's like um

912
00:37:57,519 --> 00:38:01,759
yeah I'm like riding up I'm riding the

913
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:03,359
Trailer Park Boys waves even though I'm

914
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:06,240
you know happy to be adding like my own

915
00:38:03,358 --> 00:38:08,279
you know something I like your own thing

916
00:38:06,239 --> 00:38:11,399
that you got going on there the Trailer

917
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:14,040
Park Boys Art's cool it's funny as hell

918
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:17,358
uh I think more than anything what I

919
00:38:14,039 --> 00:38:20,079
appreciate about art is the artist and

920
00:38:17,358 --> 00:38:22,960
having that trademark signature thing

921
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:26,240
that they do you know and a lot of your

922
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:28,519
prints uh are heavy on the red you do a

923
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:31,279
lot of heavy Reds on stuff and that

924
00:38:28,519 --> 00:38:34,838
makes it pop and it's kind of like an

925
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:36,480
alternative comic type art I think it's

926
00:38:34,838 --> 00:38:39,000
really cool how you do that man it's

927
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:42,760
your own thing uh we are going to be

928
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:45,719

00:38:49,838 --> 00:38:55,400
good luck everybody I give you guys a

933
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:57,400
few minutes to an ask a question this

934
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:59,240
how you use it taco

935
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:00,960
he says after the last season of

936
00:38:59,239 --> 00:39:03,598
Skinwalker Ranch what do you think's

937
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:07,400
going on out

938
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:09,480
there is that an alien reference yeah

939
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:11,079
yes do you believe in aliens I think

940
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:13,960
that's what he's

941
00:39:11,079 --> 00:39:16,039
asking um I definitely like think that

942
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:18,599
there'd be other life in the universe

943
00:39:16,039 --> 00:39:21,800
whether or not they're like contacting

944
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:25,200
our planet you know I guess

945
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:27,560
uh I'm I'm I'm I'm neutral about

946
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:29,799
it like

947
00:39:27,559 --> 00:39:31,880
open to the IDE in the news like like

948
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:33,720
the testimony before Congress and the

949
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:36,200
states and stuff I I've heard it's going

950
00:39:33,719 --> 00:39:39,279
on I saw a few memes where they they

951
00:39:36,199 --> 00:39:40,799
they put Jacob like uh into the Congress

952
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:44,359
you know

953
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:46,599
testifying for example and uh so I'm I'm

954
00:39:44,358 --> 00:39:48,400
I'm I'm I'm s vaguely aware of of that

955
00:39:46,599 --> 00:39:50,720
going on but yeah I'm not aware of like

956
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:53,280
you know what they've been saying but

957
00:39:50,719 --> 00:39:54,598
uh I yeah I definitely think that

958
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:56,040
there'd be other it would be like pretty

959
00:39:54,599 --> 00:39:58,240
presumptuous to think there'd be no

960
00:39:56,039 --> 00:40:00,358
other life anywhere in the universe that

961
00:39:58,239 --> 00:40:02,399
that seems ridiculous how I feel about

962
00:40:00,358 --> 00:40:05,960
it

963
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:08,559
too steu says where in the [ __ ] did the

964
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:10,559
idea for Steve French come

965
00:40:08,559 --> 00:40:15,400
from yeah for some reason I think it was

966
00:40:10,559 --> 00:40:17,559
from the mind of uh Mike Smith AKA

967
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:21,200
bubbles although who

968
00:40:17,559 --> 00:40:23,960
like I mean I think the like clattenburg

969
00:40:21,199 --> 00:40:27,078
and the boys would write sort of write

970
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:30,519
together in the early days

971
00:40:27,079 --> 00:40:33,160
excuse me have a sip of tea

972
00:40:30,519 --> 00:40:36,039
here so it yeah it could have been from

973
00:40:33,159 --> 00:40:40,000
the mind of Mike platberg

974
00:40:36,039 --> 00:40:41,719
yeah yeah yeah who I'm I'm I'm amazed at

975
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,920
uh like all the good ideas that the guys

976
00:40:41,719 --> 00:40:47,679
come up with you know even like ideas

977
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:49,680
like a giving a cougar a name like Steve

978
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:52,480
French

979
00:40:49,679 --> 00:40:55,318
genius yeah that that was

980
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:58,639
ridiculous um besides your own character

981
00:40:55,318 --> 00:41:02,239
what was your favorite character on the

982
00:40:58,639 --> 00:41:06,159
show not people not actors but actual

983
00:41:02,239 --> 00:41:08,598
character I think like Ry the uh Ray

984
00:41:06,159 --> 00:41:10,838
Ricky's dad both because I mean both

985
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:13,640
because it's so well you know executed

986
00:41:10,838 --> 00:41:16,440
well acted but yeah he's just such a I

987
00:41:13,639 --> 00:41:19,559
mean sort of like Ricky they're

988
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:21,119
characters that like you come across in

00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:21,000
sometimes but I also like bringing

brain is pink cush crossed with brain

1009
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:35,000
OG that sounds very believable all right

1010
00:42:32,719 --> 00:42:36,480
have to look that one up I know some

1011
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,039
people that were growing in the area

1012
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,199
about that time they might know more

1013
00:42:38,039 --> 00:42:43,119
about

1014
00:42:39,199 --> 00:42:47,039
it so throughout working on trailer park

1015
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:50,039
boys doing extras um even doing your

1016
00:42:47,039 --> 00:42:51,400
art what do you think some of the best

1017
00:42:50,039 --> 00:42:53,519
things that you've learned from

1018
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:58,160
progressing your life through that

1019
00:42:53,519 --> 00:42:58,159
situation uh what has it taught you

1020
00:42:58,559 --> 00:43:00,880
oh

1021
00:43:01,358 --> 00:43:07,679
man I've been reflecting like in recent

1022
00:43:04,199 --> 00:43:09,318
you know days weeks how uh I feel like

1023
00:43:07,679 --> 00:43:11,598
I'm you

1024
00:43:09,318 --> 00:43:16,079
know sort of learning the same lessons

1025
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:18,200
over and over again in in life so I

1026
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:21,160
don't know if I'm learning anything

1027
00:43:18,199 --> 00:43:22,799
really sometimes sometimes you gotta

1028
00:43:21,159 --> 00:43:25,159
learn some things

1029
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:27,880
hard I'm really trying to this stage of

1030
00:43:25,159 --> 00:43:29,199
my life I mean I'm I'm 48 but and I've

1031
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:30,640
been doing this for a while but it's

1032
00:43:29,199 --> 00:43:33,639
like hard I mean it's easier said than

1033
00:43:30,639 --> 00:43:35,039
done but sort of simplifying things so

1034
00:43:33,639 --> 00:43:36,598
like moving from the city to the country

1035
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:40,400
it was a big you know step in that

1036
00:43:36,599 --> 00:43:40,400
direction so it's just like you know

1037
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:44,240
less less

1038
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:46,200
distraction I guess like like sort of

1039
00:43:44,239 --> 00:43:48,959
simplifying in a physical and and in a

1040
00:43:46,199 --> 00:43:52,919
mental sense

1041
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:54,079
um and uh so yeah it's like I'm I'm I'm

1042
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:56,760
I'm feeling pretty high all of a sudden

1043
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:59,480
here as I try to describe this

1044
00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:03,079
oh no Jacob Gins of all [ __ ] people

1045
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:05,880
is high on our podcast about weed like

1046
00:44:03,079 --> 00:44:08,000
yeah dare I'm trying to like arrange my

1047
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:09,680
life so like to like you know not be in

1048
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,440
the rat race but I mean that's like I

1049
00:44:09,679 --> 00:44:13,480
mean I guess who wouldn't like that in a

1050
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:16,119
way but

1051
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:18,920
uh I find it's easy to fall into the you

1052
00:44:16,119 --> 00:44:21,358
know sort of habit of working

1053
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:23,480
constantly um I mean often like you're

1054
00:44:21,358 --> 00:44:25,480
doing that just to get by you know I'm

1055
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:28,358
I've I've been that in that situation

1056
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:30,358
you know a lot including in recent years

1057
00:44:28,358 --> 00:44:34,159
but then like yeah trying to figure out

1058
00:44:30,358 --> 00:44:35,920
a balance between yeah like work and

1059
00:44:34,159 --> 00:44:39,078
life where you're not like working too

1060
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:40,680
much I mean I I do take like I I travel

1061
00:44:39,079 --> 00:44:42,000
in the winter and take a lot of time

1062
00:44:40,679 --> 00:44:43,919
like I wouldn't be working full-time

1063
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,760
when I'm traveling in the winter so when

1064
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:48,880
it's averaged across the

1065
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:50,559
year maybe I'm like doing pretty well

1066
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:53,760
but I still feel like I'm working too

1067
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:56,400
much by my standards it's it's a

1068
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:57,960
constant balance that's part of life is

1069
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:00,680
trying to find that balance try to find

1070
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:02,599
that yeah and as an artist I find it

1071
00:45:00,679 --> 00:45:06,279
hard or as an artist as I don't know as

1072
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:08,359
a stoner as a human

1073
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:11,200
like and sort of being in charge of

1074
00:45:08,358 --> 00:45:13,558
myself I find pretty challenging to like

1075
00:45:11,199 --> 00:45:16,759
you know um manage my time in a way

1076
00:45:13,559 --> 00:45:18,000
that's effective often you know like so

1077
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:20,240
that's that's a constant [ __ ]

1078
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,880
struggle for me man oh

1079
00:45:20,239 --> 00:45:24,519
man I I don't think it really stops

1080
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:27,160
until you got somebody wiping your butt

1081
00:45:24,519 --> 00:45:28,679
for you you know

1082
00:45:27,159 --> 00:45:31,118
I think that's just one of those things

1083
00:45:28,679 --> 00:45:32,239
you're always chasing whether it's yeah

1084
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:35,920
whether that's because you're old or

1085
00:45:32,239 --> 00:45:35,919
because you're just Rich enough to have

1086
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:41,079
some hopefully the

1087
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:44,119
lad

1088
00:45:41,079 --> 00:45:45,519
no uh John you're taking my question

1089
00:45:44,119 --> 00:45:48,400
here

1090
00:45:45,519 --> 00:45:50,440
man says favorite cut of cannabis on

1091
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:53,400
island pick one so that's a question I

1092
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:55,000
usually ask on my my meet the breeder

1093
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:58,119
episodes where we interview cannabis

1094
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:00,838
breeders but uh we'll see if you got one

1095
00:45:58,119 --> 00:46:03,559
what does that mean exactly can you bit

1096
00:46:00,838 --> 00:46:07,000
I will re read it yes

1097
00:46:03,559 --> 00:46:08,880
John um if you went on to a desert

1098
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:11,199
island I told you Jake you can only take

1099
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:13,800
one type of cannabis with

1100
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:16,279
you and nothing else for the rest of

1101
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:19,318
your life what type of cannabis would

1102
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:21,480
you bring oh I guess well I mean find me

1103
00:46:19,318 --> 00:46:23,279
some of that pinky in the brain that

1104
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:25,079
pinky in the brain what was it about

1105
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:27,720
that that was so outstanding was it the

1106
00:46:25,079 --> 00:46:32,440
flavor the

1107
00:46:27,719 --> 00:46:34,719
it was I guess like it was the High

1108
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:36,599
um I guess it was like the right balance

1109
00:46:34,719 --> 00:46:38,279
of like body and head in a certain way

1110
00:46:36,599 --> 00:46:41,480
that was both

1111
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:43,079
like strong but not too strong where it

1112
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:44,639
sort of like would would knock me out

1113
00:46:43,079 --> 00:46:47,760
but I was still like I guess maybe had

1114
00:46:44,639 --> 00:46:50,239
like some euphoric elements to it that

1115
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:53,240
uh that I liked and and it didn't seem

1116
00:46:50,239 --> 00:46:54,358
to like Peter out over time at least for

1117
00:46:53,239 --> 00:46:56,358
the time that I had the weed I don't

1118
00:46:54,358 --> 00:46:58,598
think I had like a giant p of it or

1119
00:46:56,358 --> 00:47:01,558
anything

1120
00:46:58,599 --> 00:47:02,800
but um it wasn't a quick High it stuck

1121
00:47:01,559 --> 00:47:04,839
around for a

1122
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:07,480
while it was and it was like a really

1123
00:47:04,838 --> 00:47:09,759
full kind of high is what I like how I

1124
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:11,199
want to describe it for some reason had

1125
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:12,880
depth to

1126
00:47:11,199 --> 00:47:18,358
it

1127
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:21,200
um in the way that you is that oh man so

1128
00:47:18,358 --> 00:47:24,719
out of all your time uh doing Trailer

1129
00:47:21,199 --> 00:47:27,719
Park Boys and everything do you have any

1130
00:47:24,719 --> 00:47:27,719
regrets

1131
00:47:30,519 --> 00:47:34,440
um no I mean like certainly not like to

1132
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:37,838
do with the

1133
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:40,480
show I mean like like sometimes I wonder

1134
00:47:37,838 --> 00:47:41,838
if I could have like parlayed I mean I

1135
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:43,480
can still like look for other acting

1136
00:47:41,838 --> 00:47:46,759
jobs it's not something that that I

1137
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:49,880
actively do at all but uh like I may

1138
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:52,119
have you know missed opportunities to

1139
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:54,720
like yeah parlay my trailer park boys

1140
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:56,440
like you know sort of minor Fame into

1141
00:47:54,719 --> 00:47:57,838
other like

1142
00:47:56,440 --> 00:48:00,639
jobs I

1143
00:47:57,838 --> 00:48:02,000
guess like acting or or otherwise I'm

1144
00:48:00,639 --> 00:48:06,039
I'm definitely not really like a like

1145
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:09,559
much of a hustler type um but still you

1146
00:48:06,039 --> 00:48:09,558
know like sometimes

1147
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:15,838
uh you know my lack of sort of get up

1148
00:48:12,358 --> 00:48:19,719
and go um it's it's one of the things

1149
00:48:15,838 --> 00:48:21,199
you know reflect on from time to time

1150
00:48:19,719 --> 00:48:23,519
but yeah calling it a regret might be a

1151
00:48:21,199 --> 00:48:27,639
little bit uh I I try not to think of it

1152
00:48:23,519 --> 00:48:27,639
that way I guess yeah

1153
00:48:28,199 --> 00:48:33,719
oh yes thank you Taco um so we were

1154
00:48:31,838 --> 00:48:35,599
talking about rolling joints and taking

1155
00:48:33,719 --> 00:48:38,239
dabs earlier you said you weren't much

1156
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:41,680
of a concentrates guy unless it came to

1157
00:48:38,239 --> 00:48:43,879
like a vaporizer pen um what is your

1158
00:48:41,679 --> 00:48:48,879
favorite method of

1159
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:51,119
consumption I uh I like to smoke joints

1160
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:53,400
um and

1161
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:55,318
uh maybe it's because it's a product of

1162
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:58,358
growing up in Ottawa so I I like a

1163
00:48:55,318 --> 00:49:00,318
little sprinkle up tobacco with my flour

1164
00:48:58,358 --> 00:49:05,960
which I know a lot of people will like

1165
00:49:00,318 --> 00:49:08,400
uh you know B at but uh yeah that's

1166
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:11,639
my that's my favorite all doesn't need

1167
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:13,480
to be much like just you know 5% 10% not

1168
00:49:11,639 --> 00:49:18,039
like the British style where it's like

1169
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:20,358
80% or you know the vast majority of it

1170
00:49:18,039 --> 00:49:25,119
is is tobacco those I find hard to smoke

1171
00:49:20,358 --> 00:49:27,480
but yeah yeah I find con just stronger

1172
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:30,440
than NE necessary by and large although

1173
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:32,318
I certainly enjoy like hash yeah do you

1174
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:35,559
buy like pre-rolled cones or do you roll

1175
00:49:32,318 --> 00:49:37,920
them yourself I just roll joints with

1176
00:49:35,559 --> 00:49:41,200
like regular size papers normally like

1177
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:43,039
some little you know OCB is that your

1178
00:49:41,199 --> 00:49:44,679
preferred paper or is it just any paper

1179
00:49:43,039 --> 00:49:47,599
it'll do that's just just what I they

1180
00:49:44,679 --> 00:49:49,719
were uh I I bought these on on Amazon

1181
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:52,200
they were like you know decent price on

1182
00:49:49,719 --> 00:49:54,558
them but I just like any any thin paper

1183
00:49:52,199 --> 00:49:56,960
will do basically and I don't like to

1184
00:49:54,559 --> 00:50:01,440
spend like three bucks on my papers

1185
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:04,400
so I'll try to get a deal hell yeah all

1186
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:06,639
right man well before we get going here

1187
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:07,920
oh Taco says what's your favorite type

1188
00:50:06,639 --> 00:50:11,118
of

1189
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:13,639
edible oo you know I think I I haven't

1190
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:14,920
done Edibles in the in uh in the last

1191
00:50:13,639 --> 00:50:17,679
week or so I think I might have some

1192
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:19,798
tonight but maybe just a nice glob of

1193
00:50:17,679 --> 00:50:21,919
Rick Simpson Oil you know like a maybe a

1194
00:50:19,798 --> 00:50:24,440
double rice grain like right out of the

1195
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:27,358
syringe onto my thumbnail and

1196
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:29,599
then nice yeah I mean that's that's a

1197
00:50:27,358 --> 00:50:32,558
good utilitarian simple way to do it

1198
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:35,079
although I certainly enjoy like I had a

1199
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:36,280
delicious uh [ __ ] what was it I think it

1200
00:50:35,079 --> 00:50:38,880
was a peanut

1201
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:40,839
butter cup or something that like this

1202
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:43,838
fancy Bakery had made that was

1203
00:50:40,838 --> 00:50:47,279
apparently an edable although it was so

1204
00:50:43,838 --> 00:50:48,960
delicious I didn't taste any uh cannabis

1205
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:52,359
like there there was no there was no

1206
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:53,838
discernable cannabis flavor in it not

1207
00:50:52,358 --> 00:50:57,598
that that that couldn't also be

1208
00:50:53,838 --> 00:50:59,239
delicious if depends it depends it it

1209
00:50:57,599 --> 00:51:01,000
can be overpowering or in something it

1210
00:50:59,239 --> 00:51:03,519
doesn't necessarily blend with a flavor

1211
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:05,159
in a way that's like yummy but uh these

1212
00:51:03,519 --> 00:51:07,119
tastes like straight up like baked you

1213
00:51:05,159 --> 00:51:09,159
know baked good so that was I was

1214
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:11,960
impressed I was wondering like can this

1215
00:51:09,159 --> 00:51:14,480
really be this is this really in

1216
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:17,720
edible there's definitely different

1217
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:19,519
quality variants of most Edibles even

1218
00:51:17,719 --> 00:51:22,000
with the what you were calling the weed

1219
00:51:19,519 --> 00:51:23,559
oil the Rick Simpson Oil or

1220
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:26,239
RSO

1221
00:51:23,559 --> 00:51:29,640
um I've had some of that that just makes

1222
00:51:26,239 --> 00:51:31,358
me choke it's just nasty just really

1223
00:51:29,639 --> 00:51:33,598
really bad and then I've had other ones

1224
00:51:31,358 --> 00:51:35,838
where it's like oh my God I appreciate

1225
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:38,559
every flavor of this cannabis you know

1226
00:51:35,838 --> 00:51:41,119
it just it tastes like cannabis cannabis

1227
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:44,640
yeah not like where some others are dark

1228
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:46,920
and alcoho and I generally try to like

1229
00:51:44,639 --> 00:51:48,759
just swallow it and not get it like into

1230
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:50,000
my mouth but yeah like when you do get

1231
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:51,880
it in your mouth I again there's a lot

1232
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,880
of flavor in there like if it's all you

1233
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:55,400
know if the tacky oil is like spreading

1234
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:56,559
around your mouth yeah and it can be

1235
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:58,480
either

1236
00:51:56,559 --> 00:52:00,319
like yeah kind of pleasant and

1237
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:05,519
interesting or yeah like overwhelming

1238
00:52:00,318 --> 00:52:06,920
and like yeah not good basically awesome

1239
00:52:05,519 --> 00:52:10,679
there's there's a lot of factors I guess

1240
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:13,079
that go uh that can be at play there

1241
00:52:10,679 --> 00:52:14,919
I've seen like R that's like or so

1242
00:52:13,079 --> 00:52:18,000
that's really chunky and like suspicious

1243
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:20,519
looking like maybe not filtered properly

1244
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:23,079
or I guess I do get chunks sometimes in

1245
00:52:20,519 --> 00:52:26,318
the bottom of cook too long gets really

1246
00:52:23,079 --> 00:52:28,480
thick maybe yeah but uh but like

1247
00:52:26,318 --> 00:52:30,519
normally it's pretty consistent oil I

1248
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:32,639
guess maybe on on the second run you get

1249
00:52:30,519 --> 00:52:35,119
more like maybe some waxes coming out of

1250
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:37,558
the uh plant when you're if if it's been

1251
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:39,640
seting in the alcohol longer it's been a

1252
00:52:37,559 --> 00:52:41,519
long time since I've made Rick Simpson

1253
00:52:39,639 --> 00:52:44,118
Oil myself but maybe somebody can speak

1254
00:52:41,519 --> 00:52:46,039
on it in chat before we get going here

1255
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:47,480

1256
00:52:46,039 --> 00:52:49,558

lying in a on a couch kind of thing like

1265
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:13,720

1275
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:43,440
cannabis experience throughout it um and

1276
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:45,519
how it plays into you I've seen you go

1277
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:49,318
around at a lot of dispensaries that are

1278
00:53:45,519 --> 00:53:51,400
local to you um and Shout them out would

1279
00:53:49,318 --> 00:53:53,358
it be fair to say that you are a

1280
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:56,318
cannabis Advocate and that you advocate

1281
00:53:53,358 --> 00:53:58,679
for the plant

1282
00:53:56,318 --> 00:54:01,079
um I do yeah I'm like sort of passive

1283
00:53:58,679 --> 00:54:06,000
about it but yeah for sure I'm a I'm an

1284
00:54:01,079 --> 00:54:08,480
advocate of for cannabis hell how how do

1285
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:10,559
you view it is it something that works

1286
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:11,480
for you medically I would think so

1287
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:15,839
taking

1288
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:15,838
RSO yeah or is it more of a

1289
00:54:16,199 --> 00:54:20,838
recreational I

1290
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:23,358
mean I guess like a little from you know

1291
00:54:20,838 --> 00:54:26,440
joint a a little from joint

1292
00:54:23,358 --> 00:54:28,078
B I do I mean

1293
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:30,000
I've come to think of my you know

1294
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:32,039
smoking weed as you know some version of

1295
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,960
self-medicating like you know sort of in

1296
00:54:32,039 --> 00:54:35,558
retrospect from what I started smoking

1297
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:38,280
it to the

1298
00:54:35,559 --> 00:54:42,119
present AB but I also like smoking it

1299
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:43,880
for fun yeah with you I'm with you

1300
00:54:42,119 --> 00:54:45,599
that's how it always was for me as a kid

1301
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:47,358
going into it it was definitely a

1302
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:50,359
recreational thing you know I want to

1303
00:54:47,358 --> 00:54:52,239
get high with my friends um and as I got

1304
00:54:50,358 --> 00:54:54,318
older I started getting back pain neck

1305
00:54:52,239 --> 00:54:55,639
pain things like this I really started

1306
00:54:54,318 --> 00:54:59,079
focus on

1307
00:54:55,639 --> 00:55:02,838
this is helping with that which strains

1308
00:54:59,079 --> 00:55:04,960
which types can I find that balance me

1309
00:55:02,838 --> 00:55:06,639
out in those areas the most which one

1310
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:09,199
takes away my neck pain the most which

1311
00:55:06,639 --> 00:55:11,598
one helps me with my back pain the most

1312
00:55:09,199 --> 00:55:15,118
um and then also a side effect of that

1313
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:17,920
is you get high so it's it's for both

1314
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:19,920
for sure yeah and I mean I also find

1315
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:22,240
that like uh like with eating it like if

1316
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:25,760
you get like a small dose of oil or you

1317
00:55:22,239 --> 00:55:28,279
know whatever your your your method um a

1318
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:31,599
preference is like doing a low grade

1319
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:32,798
dose during the day is a nice you know

1320
00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:34,880
way

1321
00:55:32,798 --> 00:55:37,519
to

1322
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:40,039
like like it's it's not the the same

1323
00:55:37,519 --> 00:55:43,159
heady high or noticeable sort of buzz

1324
00:55:40,039 --> 00:55:45,200
but uh yeah it's sort of a mild uplift

1325
00:55:43,159 --> 00:55:48,759
which you know

1326
00:55:45,199 --> 00:55:51,719
um is uh which is real

1327
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:55,720

somewhere to sort of move to where I

1378
00:58:07,358 --> 00:58:11,159
could like do what I'm doing now but

1379
00:58:09,159 --> 00:58:12,480
