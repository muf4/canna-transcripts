i'm very excited to have you on this is

56
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,199
a bit of a different podcast it's very

57
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:13,679
cannabis related but we're kind of

58
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:15,919
delving into what you do today and i'm

59
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,840
actually extremely excited for this when

60
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:20,639
did your interest in working with

61
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,319
cannabis begin i'm 50 years old and i

62
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:24,318
grew up in a household where both of my

63
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:25,839
parents were cannabis users

64
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:27,919
they were also both in the medical

65
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,920
industry my dad became a doctor my mom

66
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:32,079
left the medical industry and

67
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:33,679
became actually a nuclear physicist so

68
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,840
she moved into a different realm of

69
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,439
stressful jobs but they both continued

70
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,200
to use cannabis throughout my life and

71
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:39,919
then when i grew up

72
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:41,039
i

73
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:43,199
saw that

74
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:46,878
there were two people in my life that

75
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:48,479
were successful no problems

76
00:02:46,878 --> 00:02:50,878
had basically whatever they wanted to

77
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:52,159
work for to get and

78
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:53,359
used cannabis

79
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:54,719
and

80
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,160
my dad

81
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:57,519
being in the medical industry would

82
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:59,120
always

83
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,439
you know he'd always had plants going on

84
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,719
but he always had something to make out

85
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:05,199
of it you know whether it be something

86
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:06,560
silly back in the day like brownies or

87
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:08,479
rice krispies treats you know i hate to

88
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,080
use candy and sugar vehicles like that

89
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:11,598
as a topic but

90
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,519
you know those things were vehicles for

91
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:15,518
cannabinoids back in the day when that

92
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,319
was your level of cooking with cannabis

93
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,680
so

94
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:20,479
i just kind of took that and added it to

95
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,000
my

96
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:25,359
profession as a culinarian and as a chef

97
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,239
and

98
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,319
just

99
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,480
tried to apply it without being too

100
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:32,000
scientific at the time

101
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:33,679
everybody's getting really scientific

102
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,719
now and everybody knows everything and

103
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,239
yet

104
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:38,158
everybody knows everything everybody's

105
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,200
the master grower you know everybody's

106
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:41,679
all this

107
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:43,439
and it's really it's kind of a

108
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,439
convoluted

109
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:47,199
i don't even care i can't call it an

110
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:49,039
industry because it's not an industry

111
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:51,039
because it's not nationwide

112
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:53,120
it's sparse it's in certain areas and

113
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:55,120
it's controlled in different ways and

114
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,200
nobody's controlling a [ __ ] carrot in

115
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,878
all these different ways so why are you

116
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:00,399
gonna try to control cannabis in a

117
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:02,079
different way and i know that the

118
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,920
benefits are highly different from a

119
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:07,280
carrot versus cannabis but i mean still

120
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:09,438
if they're going to regulate it they

121
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,878
really need to start coming together and

122
00:04:09,438 --> 00:04:11,919
because there's people out here there

123
00:04:10,878 --> 00:04:13,438
like me

124
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:16,798
who are

125
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:19,279
not looking for the highly processed

126
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:22,078
edibles in the store we're not looking

127
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:24,879
for the next strain that is named after

128
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,560
a candy bar or a wrapper

129
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:28,399
we're not looking for that

130
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,079
what i like to call real cannabis

131
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:33,120
consumers

132
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:34,959
and not just end users

133
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,600
so a lot of people are in this industry

134
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:39,918
without drawing a paycheck from

135
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,759
a company you can't be in an industry if

136
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:44,079
you're just an end user oh i smoke a lot

137
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:46,000
of weed yeah i'm in the industry i come

138
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:48,719
across that all the time and it just

139
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,959
it's it's like jaded me for a lot of

140
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,320
things and it's kind of moved me away

141
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:53,519
from a lot of things

142
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:56,000
i get these

143
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:58,478
messages all the time from j s casting

144
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,279
to go and be on the next you know

145
00:04:58,478 --> 00:05:03,758
chopped cannabis show and all this and i

146
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:06,399
don't answer any of them because i don't

147
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:10,479
feel the i need the validity of what i'm

148
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:12,159
doing to shine through i need to maybe

149
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:13,279
talk about things a little bit more

150
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,600
openly

151
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:18,239
and ask people

152
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,560
i.e the larger conglomerates and

153
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,160
companies i mean people in general but

154
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,199
there are owners and ceos of these

155
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:27,680
companies

156
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:28,879
that are buying 65 000 pounds of sugar a

157
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,680
month

158
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:34,639
and only buying and only buying 20

159
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,959
pounds of cannabis extract to put into

160
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:39,280
their gummies and then selling them to

161
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:42,799
the mass market which is basically my

162
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:44,879
grandmother and it's just so sad

163
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,360
i want people and i'm sorry i'm on the

164
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:49,680
dennis miller style rant here but

165
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,038
no you're i really want people to

166
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,038
understand that

167
00:05:51,038 --> 00:05:54,159
the plant is edible from the roots to

168
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:56,719
the tip

169
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,240
the leaves are highly nutritional the

170
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,800
biggest benefits that we found from

171
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,800
cannabinoids and cannabis yet are not

172
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,680
from any of the ways that any of us are

173
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,759
consuming it it's juicing it

174
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,439
and drinking the juice immediately all

175
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:12,240
the studies in israel that were done in

176
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:14,639
the 60s and now that are done in from

177
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,879
2005 up

178
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,639
are the phytonutrients and the

179
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:20,719
availability of what you can get from

180
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,918
just and then auger juicing and that's

181
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,960
another thing everybody's like oh i'm

182
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:23,839
going to go out and get a juicer and i'm

183
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:25,198
going to juice it and i'm going to be

184
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:27,198
like yeah yeah yeah

185
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:29,360
no you have to have an auger juicer like

186
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:31,680
you were juicing wheatgrass

187
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:34,319
because the centrifugal force of

188
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,079
the force-driven motor-driven juicers

189
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,439
are just killing half of the nutrients

190
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:39,359
it's just like we're doing when we're

191
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:40,879
smoking weed but i'm not really yeah i'm

192
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,960
not gonna stop smoking weed i'm gonna

193
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:43,759
get as many cannabinoids in my body as i

194
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:46,560
can

195
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:48,479
and i don't eat heavy doses of cannabis

196
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,038
a lot of people think i eat a lot of

197
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:53,038
cannabis because i cook with it i don't

198
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:55,759
if you notice a lot of my food is based

199
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:56,959
around raw cannabis and the leaf

200
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:00,240
and other

201
00:06:56,959 --> 00:07:02,959
forms of cannabinoids and the recipes

202
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,598
and using the can't you know tonight i

203
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:07,038
made a panna cotta with cannabis pollen

204
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:09,918
a friend of mine that's a breeder gave

205
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:11,439
me a gift of cannabis pollen and it's

206
00:07:09,918 --> 00:07:13,918
highly sought after i mean some of it

207
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:15,839
goes for 600 bucks for a quarter gram

208
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:17,839
you know if you're a breeder it could go

209
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:18,879
for more than that but it's loaded with

210
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:21,359
protein

211
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:23,439
and i always see all these chefs

212
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,960
and all these culinarians in my field

213
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:27,598
always looking for the next thing you

214
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:31,918
know they're all looking for like moose

215
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:33,598
nuts from the congo of south brazil you

216
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:34,879
know something that's like

217
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:36,719
people are just going to be like oh i

218
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:38,560
need those moose nuts that's that's it i

219
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,720
need those i heard of those and i need

220
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,720
them and the chefs are all driven that

221
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,400
way but yet they have an ingredient

222
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,720
that's readily available to them they

223
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:49,439
could be using micro greens they could

224
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,960
be using juicing greens salad greens

225
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:53,279
it's really weird because

226
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:56,959
i got involved in the first farm in the

227
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:59,439
country that is usda and fda licensed to

228
00:07:56,959 --> 00:08:01,279
sell micro greens juicing greens and

229
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:02,879
salad greens cannabis hemp whatever you

230
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:05,679
want to call it sour tsunami is what we

231
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:07,520
were growing and i grew 50 acres and you

232
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,639
know i only had two chefs in the world

233
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:10,399
buy it

234
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,918
only two wow and i got it out there i

235
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:13,758

236
00:08:11,918 --> 00:08:15,519

00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:18,639
have to send it to you free i'm gonna

239
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,400
let you try it

240
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,400
do you think that's lack of experience

241
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:24,638
in working with those materials yeah i

242
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:25,918
think it's scarce slack and just lack of

243
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,240
knowledge but yet though they're all

244
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:29,839
looking for like and if i tell them i

245
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,840
got truffles they're like oh can i get

246
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:33,759
some can i get some

247
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:35,439
yeah everybody wants the truffles

248
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:37,838
i saw your post the other day about the

249
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:40,000
truffles and i want trouble

250
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,519
you live close bro and here in the next

251
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,839
two months you come on over this way and

252
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:46,000
i'll pick more truffles and you can sell

253
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,839
dude i would love that i would love to

254
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,200
go out and forge with you and just learn

255
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,800
some of your knowledge

256
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,879
i've got an extensive knowledge of

257
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:54,719
cannabis but i've just never

258
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:56,879
really been exposed to the world of

259
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,120
mycology as much and that's something

260
00:08:56,879 --> 00:09:01,919
i'd definitely like to learn i'm not a

261
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,440
professional i'm not a mycologist i'm

262
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:05,199
not a botanist

263
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,279
i'm nothing like that

264
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,200
i've gone on everything that my family

265
00:09:07,278 --> 00:09:11,679
has kind of handed down to me

266
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,720
and just whatever region you go to has

267
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:15,199
got its

268
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,278
the things like that

269
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,120
so let's loop back on that really quick

270
00:09:17,278 --> 00:09:21,439
since you brought it up from my

271
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,360
understanding are both your parents

272
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,480
italian immigrants yes

273
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,959
both of my parents were first

274
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,879
generations born here

275
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:30,958
and your father was the one that got you

276
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:32,799
into mushroom forage yeah my grandfather

277
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:36,159
vito his father

278
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:38,799
yeah he was a truffler he is a forager

279
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:40,719
we had like 300 acres farm in rhode

280
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:42,399
island when we first came here and

281
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,160
we didn't have no money man you know if

282
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,600
you wanted to eat you either had to grow

283
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:47,919
it or forage it

284
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,120
and right americans don't and i'm not

285
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:51,120
talking [ __ ] about americans i'm an

286
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,000
american i'm just saying americans don't

287
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,879
have

288
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,480
any

289
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:55,838
well there's no seasons in a grocery

290
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,519
store you go into a grocery store in

291
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:58,480
january and there's plum tomatoes you go

292
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,839
into a

293
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,680
grocery store in the middle of july

294
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:03,600
there's plum tomatoes you go in february

295
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:05,679
there's plum tomatoes

296
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,839
cold storage

297
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:10,879
and that's the thing is is that

298
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:14,079
i'm so scared right now

299
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:17,360
monsanto has registered and copy written

300
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:19,039
over 8 500 stranger cultivars of

301
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,200
cannabis

302
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:25,439
really nobody's paying attention to [ __ ]

303
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:27,519
man they did it apparently they did it

304
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,279
they did it with vegetables they're

305
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:31,039
doing it with all the hemp right now

306
00:10:29,278 --> 00:10:33,439
because they work cannabis for like the

307
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:35,039
past six years now they're doing hemp

308
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,079
because the hemp farming is getting so

309
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:38,399
damn big

310
00:10:36,078 --> 00:10:40,479
but people just have to shake off a

311
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:42,639
little bit of the dropped on their head

312
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:45,039
syndrome and kind of like

313
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:46,399
just wake up i think wake up sourcing

314
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:48,639
things fresh

315
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:51,200
naturally and locally

316
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:53,600
is very important no to them that these

317
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:56,240
people need to focus on yeah but here to

318
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:58,159
them if the that doesn't adequate that

319
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,320
doesn't fit into a drive-through method

320
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:03,360
that they don't do it or there's no app

321
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:06,000
for them that's you know what i mean

322
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,839
i'm with you yes absolutely

323
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,360
i'm very glad we did this interview i

324
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:12,640
think you and i vibe together just

325
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:15,200
perfectly okay so i wanted to touch back

326
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:16,958
you said your grandparents were italian

327
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,399
immigrants they came over here they

328
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:19,838
taught you how to forage and work with

329
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,440
these mushrooms

330
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,760
and another thing that you said was that

331
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,760
you used the entire plant from the roots

332
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:28,078
to the leaves yeah

333
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:29,759
okay if you're gonna make rso or you're

334
00:11:28,078 --> 00:11:32,399
gonna make something and you're a grower

335
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:34,159
you've got the roots those roots if they

336
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:36,559
are not and i'm not a grower i've never

337
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:38,480
grown weed in my life my wife is i have

338
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:40,319
cannot i murder plants for a living

339
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,839
that's my job so

340
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,160
if you're growing in a basin and it's

341
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:45,760
say hydroponic and you have roots that

342
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:48,639
touch the basin

343
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:50,720
between that root and that basin that

344
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:52,480
micro space there's a lot of bacteria

345
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,959
that a lot of people don't know about so

346
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:57,278
personally if any roots touch the basin

347
00:11:54,958 --> 00:12:00,000
i wouldn't use them but any other roots

348
00:11:57,278 --> 00:12:02,159
i would put them in your rso i would put

349
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,480
them in your anything i would make from

350
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:06,639
root to tip you juice them and do

351
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,920
whatever the hell you can not to waste

352
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:09,440
them

353
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:10,399
what's your favorite way to prepare

354
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,120
roots i

355
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:15,919
like to make things like if i'm making

356
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,440
well so i like to juice

357
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:19,120
you like did you yeah i like to juice

358
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,720
them because they're extremely bitter so

359
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,480
there's lots of parts of the plants that

360
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,000
i like to juice because

361
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,800
different areas on the plants and i've

362
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:30,559
done i've sat there and juiced like

363
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:32,719
70 runs just testing the taste on a few

364
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:34,559
different strains i had available and a

365
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,160
few different methods of juicing but

366
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:37,759
they're so damn bitter that you really

367
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:39,919
have to mix them with some plant matter

368
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:42,399
juice to get them down

369
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:45,599
okay i mean that's very cool pollen very

370
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:47,440
cool pollen's loaded with all sorts of

371
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,920
i mean you think about what pollen is

372
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,680
and it's the it's baby flowers floating

373
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:53,919
around from one flower to the flower so

374
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:56,000
it's already got so many nutrients and

375
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:57,199
it's loaded with protein

376
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,600
minerals

377
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,360
all sorts of vitamins and then those

378
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,440
things aren't necessary and we'll just

379
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,200
let them go you know

380
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,120
yeah that one doesn't scare me at all

381
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:10,079
you know i've been consuming bee pollen

382
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,360
for a long time so why not go with a

383
00:13:10,078 --> 00:13:13,039
plant that i'm already working with

384
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,600
that's really weird because i'm

385
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:17,599
developing a recipe um for maximum yield

386
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,360
magazine right now and it's chocolate

387
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,519
chaga truffles with bee pollen just a

388
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:24,240
little sprinkle of b palmer i'm a junkie

389
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:25,839
for b-pawn love people i am too yes

390
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,440
absolutely

391
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,800
one of the things that i appreciate

392
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,360
about your work that i've really been

393
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:33,199
following and been interested is is the

394
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,959
fact that you work with

395
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,399
ingredients that are kind of out of the

396
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:38,319
norm you know

397
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:40,879
one of the ones that i saw you post

398
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,800
about the other day was a gun powder and

399
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:44,879
can of pickled green strawberries oh

400
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:46,319
yeah what

401
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:48,559
so a lot of people don't really know

402
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,920
about gunpowder the but the highest

403
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:51,759
quality

404
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:55,039
green tea in the world is actually

405
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:56,399
grated as gunpowder green tea

406
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:59,039
really yeah

407
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:00,958
um so i like taking healing things that

408
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:03,278
people don't really know about and

409
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:05,919
people that are a little bit unknown to

410
00:14:03,278 --> 00:14:07,439
people and like i said it was so easy

411
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:09,599
being a chef when you have all these

412
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,399
normal things available to you

413
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,320
but

414
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:15,519
if you wanted to work in my kitchen as a

415
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:17,199
culinarian first of all you had to name

416
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:19,198
five apples and i don't mean grocery

417
00:14:17,198 --> 00:14:20,639
store varietals you also had to name

418
00:14:19,198 --> 00:14:22,559
what the things on the end of a fork

419
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,399
were and then you would start talking

420
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:27,039
about maybe you'd wash dishes and then

421
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:28,879
maybe you could peel carrots or

422
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:30,639
something like that but

423
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:32,879
you gotta if you're gonna be a

424
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:34,799
culinarian you gotta know your way up

425
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:35,600
and around everything that you're doing

426
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:37,519
so

427
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,040
you go to a chef and you're like cool

428
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:41,759
nice dish it looks like it was put

429
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:43,519
together by 3000 people and 20 sets of

430
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:45,198
tweezers where'd your salt and pepper

431
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:47,600
come from

432
00:14:45,198 --> 00:14:49,519
and they look at you and they and i

433
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,839
i

434
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:51,839
uh

435
00:14:52,078 --> 00:14:55,198
yeah so that story kind of sucks because

436
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:56,719
they can't even tell you where the

437
00:14:55,198 --> 00:14:59,039
freaking salt and pepper came from yet

438
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:02,320
they put it together like this

439
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:03,599
noma museum of art and charts you 65 for

440
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,639
three little bites you're gonna stop it

441
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,480
somewhere on the way home and get

442
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:08,240
something to fill you up you know

443
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,159
i was never

444
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,919
i couldn't sleep at night as a chef i

445
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:14,399
worked for two sitting presidents i

446
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:16,799
worked for president zarkozia france

447
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:18,879
i didn't cook food for them

448
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:20,639
like i went behind the boathouse at

449
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:22,480
walker point in maine and smoked weed

450
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:24,480
every day while the bush family was in

451
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:27,120
there eating lobsters

452
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:29,600
and nice i didn't feed them

453
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,959
uh [ __ ] but i also i didn't have any

454
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,800
political i have no political

455
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:35,039
affiliation i don't talk politics i

456
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:37,359
don't do i had one conversation with

457
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:39,120
laura bush and it was about lobsters and

458
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,600
the politics behind lobsters but other

459
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:43,440
than that we've never i've never spoken

460
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,320
you know it was about food

461
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,440
so

462
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,519
for me

463
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,600
it sucks that all of this has become

464
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,959
instagramable because

465
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,720
it's all

466
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:55,198
kind of based on

467
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,278
elitism and like

468
00:15:55,198 --> 00:15:58,799
you see people like

469
00:15:57,278 --> 00:16:00,240
and i'm just gonna call it what it is

470
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:02,399
but you see

471
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,919
people that are registered sex offenders

472
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:06,159
and rapists like

473
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:08,240
being held in iconic status because they

474
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:12,078
smoke weed

475
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:13,919
yeah what the hell is going on

476
00:16:12,078 --> 00:16:16,239
that's that chad cold you know what i

477
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:16,240
mean

478
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:20,879
it is what it is i mean

479
00:16:19,198 --> 00:16:23,198

481
00:16:23,198 --> 00:16:27,758

pictures out of a registered sex

501
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:10,000
offender than you are of me

502
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:11,679
i got to kind of back up you know

503
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,519
yeah and you don't need to affiliate

504
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,038
your name with that no they thought i

505
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:16,639
was weird you know

506
00:17:15,038 --> 00:17:19,199
i kind of have my own

507
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,799
i stay in my own little situation as

508
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:23,360
much as i can because

509
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:24,959
all the early cannabis chefs out there

510
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:27,279
are now all they're doing is peddling

511
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:30,080
products on their instagram they're not

512
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:31,599
pedaling it's either regurgitated

513
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:32,480
information that they got from somewhere

514
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:35,279
else

515
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,279
it's none of their own

516
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:40,879
i appreciate your organic more of you

517
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,080
know staying within your own realm

518
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,760
of this

519
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:46,558
especially the work that you've done

520
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:48,240
just locally you know for our state

521
00:17:46,558 --> 00:17:49,759

522
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,359
fest right you were cooking over at hemp

523
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:53,679
fest for the staff that's really weird

524
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:54,639
that you knew that

525
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:56,960
dude

526
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,880
you went to hemp fest for years

527
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,440
17 years

528
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:03,440
i ran the kitchen at seattle hemp fest

529
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,320
for the volunteers

530
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,120
cooked

531
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:09,759
meals ten thousand meals over the five

532
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:12,399
day period i've also done a few other

533
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:15,279
things for hempfest but again

534
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:17,120
i got jaded by what i saw

535
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:19,279
that was real

536
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:22,000
and i had to be

537
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:23,200
really honest a lot of my friends became

538
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,919
legal

539
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,759
and hemp fest was long time ago right so

540
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:29,120
my friends you get a legal cannabis

541
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:31,599
business and then

542
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:34,879
hempfest comes to you and says hey can

543
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:36,480
you sponsor the event it's 15 000

544
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,160
you know or can you buy food for the

545
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,720
event it's this and this and this it's a

546
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,400
1.8 million a year party no matter what

547
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,759
year you throw it it costs 1.8 million

548
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,160
dollars because of the land you got to

549
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:47,359
rent all the [ __ ] you got to do

550
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,038
and

551
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:52,240
every year

552
00:18:49,038 --> 00:18:53,759
every year there was a pallet of food

553
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,120
that i couldn't give to the homeless i

554
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:56,640
couldn't give to the needy i couldn't

555
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:59,678
get to the hungry and they made me throw

556
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:01,520
away but yet five but yet five months

557
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:04,640
earlier they were begging me to beg my

558
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:07,440
friends for the food to feed people with

559
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:10,000
and so it got to the point where

560
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:12,480
i wasn't gonna be quiet anymore and

561
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,679
vivian's great nivan's great don't get

562
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,960
me wrong

563
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:16,640
but

564
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,798
it's just

565
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,559
it'd be so easy to get rid of too there

566
00:19:18,798 --> 00:19:22,400

00:19:54,558 --> 00:19:57,678
about their businesses but

585
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,760

586
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:01,120
am really happy staying

00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:02,960
to myself

588
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:06,558
and just letting

589
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:09,038
cannabis and psilocybin progress the way

590
00:20:06,558 --> 00:20:12,158
that it's going to be with the

591
00:20:09,038 --> 00:20:14,558
lecherous money-hungry vultures

592
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:17,039
getting their parts first

593
00:20:14,558 --> 00:20:19,759
yeah it's like i was approached last

594
00:20:17,038 --> 00:20:21,679
year in november by national geographic

595
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:24,079
and scentsy magazine

596
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:26,559
they wanted to send a team out to

597
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:27,918
forage for wild psilocybin for the first

598
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:29,678
time and i was like you know that's cool

599
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:31,840
but i've been going to this spot for 28

600
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:33,280
years now it's shown to me by a pretty

601
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:35,599
important person

602
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:36,879
yeah and i realize that things are on

603
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:38,000
the cusp and

604
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,400
they're coming

605
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,240
two-fold and everybody's like wow and

606
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:44,159
it's cool and it's hip and it's like

607
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,880
this but like i said i've been picking

608
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:48,960
here for 28 years so i don't want you to

609
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,320
be too disrespectful of the spot and and

610
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,400
they did it right

611
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:53,759
unfortunately when they left they called

612
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,440
me back and were like hey you guys might

613
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:56,960
want to go get a coveted so my wife and

614
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,558
i went and got kobe test and sure enough

615
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,880
we both had govind

616
00:20:58,558 --> 00:21:02,798
but that was a hell of a

617
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,480
hell of a surprise from the national

618
00:21:02,798 --> 00:21:05,519
geographic team

619
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,319
but um

620
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:08,079
it's

621
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:10,798
weird how this

622
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:12,639
so 15 to 20 years ago they looked at me

623
00:21:10,798 --> 00:21:14,400
as a chef because i didn't wear a chef's

624
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,400
jacket and i pushed vegetables on my

625
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,080
menu and garden grown foods

626
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,200
and they were like you hippie granola

627
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:20,879
the [ __ ]

628
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,200
and now

629
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:25,440
you know what i mean and now

630
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,840
that's the stuff i like so i'm laughing

631
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:31,840
at myself and now they're like oh my

632
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:33,599
goodness the organic heirloom grown in

633
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:36,000
no-till soil

634
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:38,879
carrots cosmic grown carrots from blah

635
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,880
blah blah and it's funny how

636
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,559
i'm gonna and this is this is a funny

637
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,799
thing for me sitting in a cabin deep in

638
00:21:42,558 --> 00:21:47,440
the woods is saying like ted kaczynski

639
00:21:44,798 --> 00:21:49,279
is that social media has

640
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:52,159
put everything in everybody's fingertips

641
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:54,240
so everybody knows everything now

642
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:55,919
it makes all these

643
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,000
professionals a lot of

644
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:59,600
masters of nothing yeah master gardeners

645
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,279
they're in it three years they got two

646
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:03,759
crops down and they're a master gardener

647
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:06,158
on their profile yeah i know i know the

648
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:08,400
chefs were like that too uh

649
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:10,159
i just hope that

650
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,480
we have less

651
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:14,480
candy on the shelves in dispensaries and

652
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,079
pot shops or you know whatever you want

653
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,558
to call them these days

654
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:20,158
i hope that the culinarians start

655
00:22:18,558 --> 00:22:22,879
learning how to

656
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:25,520
utilize cannabinoids without using sugar

657
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:27,520
as a vehicle to get them to people

658
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:30,879
and i hope that the government gets the

659
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:33,200
standardization practice going because

660
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:35,600
if they have a standardization for what

661
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:38,400
organic is then they can surely have a

662
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:40,158
standardization for what cannabinoids

663
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,840
are and what form they are and here's

664
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:43,520
the five forms that are acceptable you

665
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:45,038
can [ __ ] use what you can use here's

666
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:46,558
what you can sell here's what you can do

667
00:22:45,038 --> 00:22:48,240
anything outside of that's the market

668
00:22:46,558 --> 00:22:49,678
it's just like people that are going to

669
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,519
get in the carrot market and start

670
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:53,440
selling as carrot dust because it's you

671
00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:54,960
know carrot dust

672
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,558
you know what i mean and there's some

673
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:59,038
people that'll be fooled with the as

674
00:22:56,558 --> 00:23:02,879
seen on tv carrot dust

675
00:22:59,038 --> 00:23:04,319
but just get a normal carrot and eat it

676
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,960
simple

677
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:08,639
amen so before we

678
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,079
head to break

679
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,840
i want to ask you what are some of your

680
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:13,918
favorite types of cannabis to work with

681
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:17,119
so fresh

682
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:18,960
cannabis pollen and young leaves i mean

683
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:20,239
a leaf that's like a shoot of like an

684
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,240
inch

685
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:24,240
um oh is there is there a certain

686
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,960
variety of cannabis that you like to use

687
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:30,240
so it really depends on what we're doing

688
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:32,558
i tend to stay away from ultra ultra

689
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:34,960
gassy terp style

690
00:23:32,558 --> 00:23:37,839
things when it's going to be eaten raw

691
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:39,919
you don't get a huge chirp profile but

692
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:43,359
some of it does show through

693
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:44,320
and i like like popcorn buds to pick a

694
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:46,798
hole

695
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:48,319
they pickle up whole tickling yeah they

696
00:23:46,798 --> 00:23:51,200
pickle up good like if they're the size

697
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:53,599
of the tip of your pinky and you do like

698
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:55,038
a warm bath pickle like pour the like

699
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:56,879
get like two or three cups of them and

700
00:23:55,038 --> 00:23:59,839
then pour the warm pickle liquid over

701
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:01,200
them let them sit at counter room room

702
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:02,879
temperature for like three hours and

703
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:05,360
then put them in a jar and then put them

704
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:08,400
in the fridge oh my goodness they're so

705
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:09,278
young tender you get this little slick

706
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,200
of

707
00:24:09,278 --> 00:24:13,519
cannabinoids and other compounds that

708
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,360
floats on the top it's it's pretty nice

709
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:17,519
to be able to plant it like that an

710
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:19,519
incredible idea

711
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:21,599
how does the infusion work on that does

712
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:23,519
the do the cannabinoids bind to anything

713
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:25,359
in the pickle here's the thing so you

714
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:28,079
just ask the perfect question so with me

715
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:28,959
i tend to layer my cannabinoids i want

716
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:31,519
people

717
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:34,159
to open their their cupboard they're

718
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:35,599
pantry and i i need you to have a i need

719
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:37,278
them to stop thinking of oh i need to

720
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:38,959
grow weed and i need to have this and oh

721
00:24:37,278 --> 00:24:41,759
it's just so complicated to know jesus

722
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:44,159
what am i going to do and it's like no

723
00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:46,558
find a way to do it find a supply

724
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:48,480
whether it's your dispensary your grower

725
00:24:46,558 --> 00:24:50,000
your whatever farmer farmers are best

726
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,079
just like our food source we're talking

727
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,919
about cannabis and then start making

728
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:56,480
things for your pantry if you use

729
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:58,080
balsamic vinegar infuse it it's acid it

730
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,240
infuses either do it the old-fashioned

731
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:01,439
way in a jar with decarb cannabis or do

732
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,038
it in a magical butter machine or

733
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:06,159
something like that

734
00:25:03,038 --> 00:25:09,359
olive oil grape seed oil soy sauce

735
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:12,080
sesame oil tamari pumpkin seed oil

736
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:15,119
sesame seed oil rice wine vinegar apple

737
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:17,359
cider vinegar the list goes on and on so

738
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:19,038
you go to make that and then use your

739
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:20,399
vinegar for the pickled cannabis bugs

740
00:25:19,038 --> 00:25:22,640
even though it's cannabis and you're

741
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,720
pouring a liquid over it that's hot

742
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,559
you're really not going to hold decarb

743
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,440
times you're not going to do too much of

744
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:29,759
that

745
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:33,919
so use half

746
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:35,759
cannabis infused vinegar in the recipe

747
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:37,919
that's a great idea so we're going to

748
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:40,158
take a quick smoke break when we come

749
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:42,159
back i want to talk to you a little bit

750
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:44,159
more about different infusions that

751
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:46,400
people can be working with everybody

752
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:48,159
works with butter everybody works you

753
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:50,400
know with the commonalities with things

754
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:52,799
that we learned online that we you know

755
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:54,320
went back for generations oil

756
00:25:52,798 --> 00:25:56,240
typical oil

757
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:57,599
people are start starting to break into

758
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,919
different things like you just said

759
00:25:57,599 --> 00:26:03,119
avocado oil grapeseed oil things like

760
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:05,600
that but i still don't see like

761
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:07,678
just this general knowledge a big

762
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:09,519
palette of materials that most people

763
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:10,480
work with at home so i kind of want to

764
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:12,158
touch base

765
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:14,319
with you on different infusions that

766
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:16,080
maybe people could be playing with that

767
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:17,519
that they can benefit from i also want

768
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:19,439

00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,798
sebastian crossy before we went to break

807
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:54,319
we were talking about

808
00:27:52,798 --> 00:27:57,278
using you know every part of the

809
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:58,960
cannabis plant including the pollen the

810
00:27:57,278 --> 00:28:02,000
roots some of the different infusions

811
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:03,360
that you like to do i want to talk now

812
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,880
like we were saying

813
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:07,199
a lot of people know how to work with

814
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,960
oils and infuse oils and fuse butters

815
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:11,840
what are some other

816
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:13,840
mediums that we could be using to infuse

817
00:28:11,839 --> 00:28:15,439
i know you do things like sugar and

818
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:17,759
stuff how do you i try to stay away from

819
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:20,798
the sugar i try to let people have other

820
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:23,359
vehicles because if you are going to

821
00:28:20,798 --> 00:28:26,000
make the sugar you actually have to make

822
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:27,599
a high alcohol tincture and then dump

823
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,119
that into the sugar evaporate the

824
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:32,398
alcohol out the cannabinoids are left in

825
00:28:29,119 --> 00:28:34,398
the sugar so on and so forth but i try

826
00:28:32,398 --> 00:28:35,359
to have people make

827
00:28:34,398 --> 00:28:37,678
like

828
00:28:35,359 --> 00:28:39,439
vanilla infused with cannabinoids so if

829
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:40,399
they're making pancakes or a cake they

830
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,320
can just

831
00:28:40,398 --> 00:28:44,079
put a little thing in so you always

832
00:28:42,319 --> 00:28:46,079
think of these little micro doses that

833
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:47,359
you can get to build up to a macro dose

834
00:28:46,079 --> 00:28:48,879
if you need to

835
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:51,599
but have them in everything in your

836
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:53,360
cupboard and pantry well you were saying

837
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:55,839
oil before because a lot of people

838
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:57,359
associate fats and cannabinoids bonding

839
00:28:55,839 --> 00:29:01,519
really well

840
00:28:57,359 --> 00:29:03,199
and right that's good and you get the

841
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:06,158
most optimum

842
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:08,319
extractions when you do things like that

843
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:09,840
but you can't neglect the fact that

844
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:10,960
acids

845
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:13,678
time

846
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,558
and other things also create infusions

847
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:17,919
so

848
00:29:14,558 --> 00:29:20,000
you can infuse vinegar you because it's

849
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:22,799
acid you know most vinegars are at five

850
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,319
percent at ph seven percent ph for a

851
00:29:22,798 --> 00:29:27,679
normal vinegar

852
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:28,879
and then i would also recommend people

853
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:30,399
and this is going to be weird because

854
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:34,559
you see it everywhere but

855
00:29:30,398 --> 00:29:37,359
people are all into the mct oil the

856
00:29:34,558 --> 00:29:39,200
coconut oil yeah that's the worst thing

857
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:41,918
you could have in the world for you

858
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:45,038
because it's been

859
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:47,600
treated to get the way that it is to be

860
00:29:45,038 --> 00:29:50,319
coconut oil is not shelf stable and

861
00:29:47,599 --> 00:29:52,158
clear and at room temperature it's

862
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:54,879
cloudy it's got solids in it you know

863
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:56,399
the other kind like the non-mct coconut

864
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:59,360
oil

865
00:29:56,398 --> 00:30:01,278
okay i have not used the mct oil but i

866
00:29:59,359 --> 00:30:03,519
have seen a lot of people don't okay you

867
00:30:01,278 --> 00:30:04,880
yeah i was afraid about the coconut oil

868
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:06,319
because i've used that a lot but it's

869
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,679
always cold

870
00:30:06,319 --> 00:30:09,278
i

871
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:11,679
the cloudy stuff the chunkies yeah

872
00:30:09,278 --> 00:30:13,440
that's what you use but so the mct oil

873
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:15,038
is like liquid at room temperature and

874
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:17,840
clear and all that and it's easy

875
00:30:15,038 --> 00:30:20,720
infusion and [ __ ] but realistically

876
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:22,798
it's medium chain triglyceride so what

877
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:25,440
they did is they took the full chains

878
00:30:22,798 --> 00:30:27,679
away so you don't have full branch chain

879
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:29,278
amino acids floating around in there and

880
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:30,960
there's only a few three or four but

881
00:30:29,278 --> 00:30:32,558
they've stripped it of that and then

882
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,759
they've taken more parts away by taking

883
00:30:32,558 --> 00:30:34,798
that natural

884
00:30:33,759 --> 00:30:36,879
whitish

885
00:30:34,798 --> 00:30:39,440
opaque pulp that's in there that's the

886
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:42,720
real oil they've taken that away too to

887
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:44,558
make it clear liquid like you know and

888
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,759
realistically it's just stripped is

889
00:30:44,558 --> 00:30:47,759
stripped so

890
00:30:45,759 --> 00:30:48,640
if you have to use it use it but i would

891
00:30:47,759 --> 00:30:51,119
say

892
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:52,320
use olive oil overly processed yeah use

893
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:54,719
olive oil

894
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:56,240
if we if you live anywhere here where we

895
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,480
live i know and we're talking we live in

896
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:01,679
the pacific northwest we have california

897
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:03,679
below us but we also have olive growers

898
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:05,360
in oregon that are right there they're

899
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:07,038
50 miles away from portland you can get

900
00:31:05,359 --> 00:31:08,719
a bottle of olive oil from them travel

901
00:31:07,038 --> 00:31:09,839
times little and i'm not bagging on

902
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,278
anything from italy that's where my

903
00:31:09,839 --> 00:31:13,759
family comes from but

904
00:31:11,278 --> 00:31:15,839
i try to buy where i can when i can

905
00:31:13,759 --> 00:31:18,480
locally because to me

906
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:20,240
it works in two different ways i

907
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:22,558
the farmer down the street is actually

908
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:26,319
my neighbor and if he can't afford to

909
00:31:22,558 --> 00:31:29,119
put shoes on his daughter's feet

910
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:30,798
or a baseball glove on his son's hands

911
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:33,199
because the local folks don't buy his

912
00:31:30,798 --> 00:31:35,359
farm product well that's not a community

913
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,558
to me so socioeconomically

914
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:38,798
says to me

915
00:31:36,558 --> 00:31:40,480
let me buy from him when i can

916
00:31:38,798 --> 00:31:42,558
all the time when i can

917
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:45,278
and because i see his daughter regularly

918
00:31:42,558 --> 00:31:46,798
i don't see the olive grower in italy

919
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:48,480
and france's daughter i don't even know

920
00:31:46,798 --> 00:31:50,319
her damn name

921
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,759
so if somebody's going broccoli it's the

922
00:31:50,319 --> 00:31:53,599
same with wheat if somebody's growing

923
00:31:51,759 --> 00:31:54,720
something that you use as a commodity in

924
00:31:53,599 --> 00:31:56,079
your life

925
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,839
that's close

926
00:31:56,079 --> 00:32:00,398
try it out you know if you if your

927
00:31:57,839 --> 00:32:01,918
family eats apples find an orchard

928
00:32:00,398 --> 00:32:03,918
go pick apples

929
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:05,440
don't just try to buy the five dollar

930
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:07,200
bag at the grocery store it might cost

931
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:09,038
you thirty dollars

932
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:11,120
at the orchard to pick the apples but

933
00:32:09,038 --> 00:32:12,879
guess what look at your kid in the face

934
00:32:11,119 --> 00:32:15,119
when you're doing it and be like oh damn

935
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,720
that's priceless you know

936
00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:18,319
and those things are taken out of a lot

937
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,759
of things when we get back to where

938
00:32:18,319 --> 00:32:21,759
we're talking about earlier the

939
00:32:19,759 --> 00:32:23,519
commercialization of cannabis and all

940
00:32:21,759 --> 00:32:25,919
that it's like

941
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:28,640
like the homegrowers got forgotten the

942
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:32,080
old school breeders forgot forgotten

943
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:33,120
because it's so commercialized now and i

944
00:32:32,079 --> 00:32:34,960
hope

945
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:36,639
to start the conversation off when we

946
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:39,200
first got back from break it was to fill

947
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:41,200
the cannabis pantry up and what ways we

948
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:43,440
can do that i don't want to see a bunch

949
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:45,038
of commercial [ __ ] in the pantry from a

950
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,240
bunch of conglomerate style big

951
00:32:45,038 --> 00:32:47,759
companies

952
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,880
you know when these people can do it

953
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:51,359
themselves

954
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:52,799
and it might not be easy to always bake

955
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:54,398
your own cake sometimes it's a little

956
00:32:52,798 --> 00:32:55,519
easier to go and get one from the store

957
00:32:54,398 --> 00:32:56,398
but

958
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:58,000
try

959
00:32:56,398 --> 00:32:59,518
and it might be that time where you're

960
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,278
going to go down the street to the hemp

961
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:03,599
farm or the cannabis farmer and be like

962
00:33:01,278 --> 00:33:06,640
yo i need a half pound i'm making

963
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:09,199
olive oil for salads um making uh

964
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:11,360
making a grape seed oil for salves and

965
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:13,200
i'm making this for this and this and

966
00:33:11,359 --> 00:33:16,079
hey do you got any calendula flowers and

967
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,080
what else do you grow

968
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:19,519
so

969
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:21,200
here's a funny thing

970
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:23,278
we're talking about that

971
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:25,200
you and i are gonna hit it off great you

972
00:33:23,278 --> 00:33:26,159
guys we're gonna hit it up great i'm a

973
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,240
very

974
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:30,640
sustainable and regenerative

975
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:32,798
local nice farmer

976
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:34,399
and i'm very into growing with k f and

977
00:33:32,798 --> 00:33:35,278
that's kind of one of the things that i

978
00:33:34,398 --> 00:33:37,359
preach

979
00:33:35,278 --> 00:33:38,960
so i'm always working with things i'm

980
00:33:37,359 --> 00:33:41,519
always going out into my lawn picking

981
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:44,319
dandelions and using that for like fpj

982
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:47,359
which is nutrients for the plant

983
00:33:44,319 --> 00:33:50,398
or even our local orchards my dad's uh

984
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:53,038
you know he's an agricultural farmer

985
00:33:50,398 --> 00:33:54,879
so we get we get all of our apples and

986
00:33:53,038 --> 00:33:57,119
everything like that from him and that

987
00:33:54,880 --> 00:34:00,240
we live in and there's a place called

988
00:33:57,119 --> 00:34:01,278
los hernandez it's a they make tamales

989
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:04,159
there

990
00:34:01,278 --> 00:34:06,558
and it's a james beard award-winning to

weeks out of the year well that gives

993
00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:12,000
[ __ ] away too right then the location

994
00:34:10,099 --> 00:34:14,159
[Laughter]

995
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:17,119
and then i'll tell you what me and carla

999
00:34:21,039 --> 00:34:24,800

1000
00:34:22,878 --> 00:34:26,799
oh yeah i'm gonna have to check those

1001
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:29,119
ones out that sounds like oh yeah but

1002
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:31,440
yes i have eight over there

1003
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:32,960
quite a few times they have excellent

1004
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,240
[ __ ] tortillas

1005
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:36,159
some of the best yeah

1006
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:37,759
he just got a james beard award like two

1007
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:41,119
years ago man he's got an award that i

1008
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:41,119
would dream of getting

1009
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:44,159
so

1010
00:34:42,398 --> 00:34:46,000
i thought it was really funny when i was

1011
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:47,599
checking out your page the other day i'm

1012
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,599
that guy that's going out in his lawn

1013
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:51,919
picking dandelion leaves using those for

1014
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:53,679
fbj and stuff like that but when you

1015
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:55,679
were talking about

1016
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:57,119
salt and pepper like that being the

1017
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:59,119
basis like

1018
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:01,200
you want to be a chef you want to cook

1019
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:02,320
you want to do this but you don't even

1020
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:03,838
don't even know where you're salting

1021
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:06,240
your peppercorn from some of the things

1022
00:35:03,838 --> 00:35:08,400
that we use the most in cooking

1023
00:35:06,239 --> 00:35:10,239
and i saw pictures are you growing

1024
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,920
peppercorns well we have uh we have

1025
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:14,319
peppercorns but they're the reverse

1026
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:16,320
peppercorns so it's a szechuan

1027
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,680
peppercorn so you don't use the corn you

1028
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,440
use the husk

1029
00:35:17,679 --> 00:35:21,440
and it's the one that makes the lips

1030
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,880
tingle it's got a chemical in it i

1031
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:25,838
forgot the name of it because you put me

1032
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,838
on the spot damn it

1033
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:30,239
i have a habit of doing that i'm sorry

1034
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:32,320
but it's uh it's so it's the reverse

1035
00:35:30,239 --> 00:35:34,719
peppercorn and you only use the husk of

1036
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:37,039
it and um so here in

1037
00:35:34,719 --> 00:35:39,919
we live in the southwest corner of our

1038
00:35:37,039 --> 00:35:41,759
state and it's kind of uh you can only

1039
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,880
grow certain things

1040
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:45,359
and

1041
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:47,280
that peppercorn tree does really well

1042
00:35:45,358 --> 00:35:49,119
over here it's actually

1043
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:52,400
a bush the size of the house so it

1044
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:55,039
produces more than we can we can harvest

1045
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:56,720
we actually moved some of it to a friend

1046
00:35:55,039 --> 00:35:58,559
of mine's winery

1047
00:35:56,719 --> 00:36:01,199
so that he could get him going because

1048
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:03,519
he wants to do uh he wants to distill it

1049
00:36:01,199 --> 00:36:06,159
down because of its lip tingling

1050
00:36:03,519 --> 00:36:08,800
qualities

1051
00:36:06,159 --> 00:36:10,559
but it works the exact same way as like

1052
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:13,119
a peppercorn does just with a little

1053
00:36:10,559 --> 00:36:13,119
absolutely

1054
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:20,720
you know it's like like i said it's the

1055
00:36:19,199 --> 00:36:22,559
basis like

1056
00:36:20,719 --> 00:36:23,519
the cooks that used to cook for me they

1057
00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:25,279
used to

1058
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:26,960
i used to come onto the line like you

1059
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,560
know half hour before dinner check

1060
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,480
everybody's setup check everybody's

1061
00:36:28,559 --> 00:36:32,239
stuff check all their consistency all

1062
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:33,920
their products and they used to have to

1063
00:36:32,239 --> 00:36:35,358
go through a mashed potato test and they

1064
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,280
hated it because it was something simple

1065
00:36:35,358 --> 00:36:39,039
it was mashed potatoes but i was like

1066
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:41,519
listen if you can't make mashed potatoes

1067
00:36:39,039 --> 00:36:43,199
right how are you going to make my 45

1068
00:36:41,519 --> 00:36:46,000
steak right

1069
00:36:43,199 --> 00:36:48,480
and then you're going to make 30 45 of

1070
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,599
steaks a night right i don't believe in

1071
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,760
that because you can't make the mashed

1072
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:54,240
potatoes right so why don't you make the

1073
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:57,040
mashed potatoes right every night for

1074
00:36:54,239 --> 00:36:59,118
four years then touch the steaks

1075
00:36:57,039 --> 00:37:00,800
and i wasn't really harping like that

1076
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:01,920
but i really wanted people to get the

1077
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,760
point of

1078
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,119
if you're not consistent with the things

1079
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,240
that are on the bottom that you think

1080
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:08,400
are the bottom

1081
00:37:06,239 --> 00:37:10,639
you're never going to be able to hold on

1082
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:12,000
to the top when you get there

1083
00:37:10,639 --> 00:37:14,000
you know and that's like what i say

1084
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,358
about salt and pepper

1085
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,440
they're the basis of our food you really

1086
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:18,799
don't need nothing else some water some

1087
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:21,200
vegetables some salt and peppers you

1088
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,800

1090
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,960

00:39:42,559 --> 00:39:45,519
my grandmother's gonna get to an age

1160
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:47,200
where she can't make her own infused

1161
00:39:45,519 --> 00:39:48,719
olive oil you know she can't go to the

1162
00:39:47,199 --> 00:39:51,519
garden she can't do this and she can't

1163
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:53,919
do that and when that time comes

1164
00:39:51,519 --> 00:39:56,159
for my grandmother your grandmother me

1165
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:58,159
you anybody else that's thinking about

1166
00:39:56,159 --> 00:40:00,559
their health in their life

1167
00:39:58,159 --> 00:40:01,838
i want there to be reputable products on

1168
00:40:00,559 --> 00:40:03,119
the shelf

1169
00:40:01,838 --> 00:40:04,559
not

1170
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:06,400
products like

1171
00:40:04,559 --> 00:40:07,599
and i'm not trying to

1172
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,838
bag on

1173
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:11,920
you know coca-cola or soda but i don't

1174
00:40:09,838 --> 00:40:13,358
want the cokes and pepsis on the

1175
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:16,159
cannabis shelf and i know there's gonna

1176
00:40:13,358 --> 00:40:17,519
be but there needs to be room

1177
00:40:16,159 --> 00:40:20,799
for the

1178
00:40:17,519 --> 00:40:23,519
medium-sized guy and the small guy

1179
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:25,519
all at the same fairness across the

1180
00:40:23,519 --> 00:40:28,159
board so that the people can make a

1181
00:40:25,519 --> 00:40:29,920
choice because there is levels of buyers

1182
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:31,440
that are out there you know and there's

1183
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,240
there's there's people out there that

1184
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:36,838
think

1185
00:40:32,239 --> 00:40:36,838
is not guilty but i mean sorry

1186
00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:43,969
i'm probably going to have to edit that

1187
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:45,519
out just so i don't get sued

1188
00:40:43,969 --> 00:40:47,039
[Music]

1189
00:40:45,519 --> 00:40:49,920
oh man

1190
00:40:47,039 --> 00:40:52,480
that's all right but

1191
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:54,400
i'm a firm believer that there's a

1192
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:55,599
reason why we're at where we're at and

1193
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,838
uh

1194
00:40:55,599 --> 00:41:00,480
i won't like i said i won't stand behind

1195
00:40:57,838 --> 00:41:03,119
products when there's question behind a

1196
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:04,960
person behind it or anything like that

1197
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:06,400
without having to name anybody and it's

1198
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:08,800
just it

1199
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,920
it makes me feel better you know as a

1200
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:12,400
as a chef

1201
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:14,559
i don't know if you know my story but

1202
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,440
when i was 17 i grew up in the puget

00:41:14,559 --> 00:41:17,759
sound

1204
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:21,838

i had a lot of growers in the area

1206
00:41:21,838 --> 00:41:25,838
and

1207
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:28,400
my english teacher was a grower and i

1208
00:41:25,838 --> 00:41:30,159
found out that canvas had a value and i

1209
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:31,599
really didn't know i didn't smoke

1210
00:41:30,159 --> 00:41:33,279

1211
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:35,920

1215
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,599
and then finally he got to the point

1216
00:41:40,318 --> 00:41:43,199
where he was like hey can you deal with

1217

1288
00:44:00,559 --> 00:44:03,838
for cape porpo's kitchens will they

1289
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:05,759
vouch for you and i said

1290
00:44:03,838 --> 00:44:07,199
i'm in president zarkozy at francis

1291
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:08,880
house three days a week on a private

1292
00:44:07,199 --> 00:44:11,439
contract i think i'll be okay with the

1293
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:13,680
bush family and i have nothing political

1294
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:15,599
you know and then then they

1295
00:44:13,679 --> 00:44:17,039
pull my jacket from prison make sure you

1296
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:19,039
know everything was good everything was

1297
00:44:17,039 --> 00:44:20,880
good and then so i ended up doing three

1298
00:44:19,039 --> 00:44:23,119
days a week at the bush residence in

1299
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:25,519
walker point and then right across the

1300
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:27,358
sound from him or peninsula or isthmus

1301
00:44:25,519 --> 00:44:29,358
or whatever it's called is president

1302
00:44:27,358 --> 00:44:30,480
zarkozy of france the former president

1303
00:44:29,358 --> 00:44:32,318
of france

1304
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:34,400
property and i would do three days a

1305
00:44:32,318 --> 00:44:36,400
week there so it was kind of cool

1306
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:38,400
because i went from prison

1307
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:40,559
to two presidents one of a foreign

1308
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:42,559
country in one of our country

1309
00:44:40,559 --> 00:44:44,880
and i would sit in the back of their

1310
00:44:42,559 --> 00:44:47,599
houses and smoke weed every day that i

1311
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:50,000
worked there and it felt really good

1312
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:52,079
but i never thought that we were going

1313
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,960
to move mainstream in my lifetime like

1314
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:54,960

1315
00:44:55,119 --> 00:45:00,400

1317
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:04,559

1319
00:45:04,559 --> 00:45:09,119

1320
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,079
word papawi is a native term

1321
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:11,838
and it's

1322
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:13,440
the only people

1323
00:45:11,838 --> 00:45:16,799
that have

1324
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:19,679
a word for it is the native folks and it

1325
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:20,960
is uh it means the force of which

1326
00:45:19,679 --> 00:45:23,039
mushrooms

1327
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:24,960
are pushing themselves out of the ground

1328
00:45:23,039 --> 00:45:26,000
overnight that's what the word papawi

1329
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:27,838
means

1330
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,519
it's really weird because they're the

1331
00:45:27,838 --> 00:45:31,519
only people that have a word for it we

1332
00:45:29,519 --> 00:45:33,599
don't even have a word for it i tried to

1333
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:35,440
dig up you know my my ancestors are

1334
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:37,838
northern italian from abruzzo and i

1335
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:40,639
tried to dig up there's a lot of what we

1336
00:45:37,838 --> 00:45:42,559
would consider witches and people really

1337
00:45:40,639 --> 00:45:43,838
associated with the land from where i

1338
00:45:42,559 --> 00:45:46,159
come from in italy

1339
00:45:43,838 --> 00:45:48,639
they don't even have a word for it so

1340
00:45:46,159 --> 00:45:50,639
the natives and specifically the natives

1341
00:45:48,639 --> 00:45:52,239
here in the pacific northwest

1342
00:45:50,639 --> 00:45:53,759
had a word for

1343
00:45:52,239 --> 00:45:56,879
the force

1344
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:59,119
of which a mushroom pushes itself out of

1345
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:01,358
the ground overnight with

1346
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:04,318
so the papali definitely for me means

1347
00:46:01,358 --> 00:46:06,880
something and this event is held

1348
00:46:04,318 --> 00:46:08,800
going to be held in november 12th

1349
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:11,519
13th and 14th on the long beach

1350
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:13,519
peninsula of washington and for those

1351
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:16,159
that know psilocybin mushrooms that's

1352
00:46:13,519 --> 00:46:18,000
actually the psilocybin mushroom capital

1353
00:46:16,159 --> 00:46:20,719
of the world in november

1354
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:23,358
you can forage for

1355
00:46:20,719 --> 00:46:24,239
psilocybin as a resident which is a

1356
00:46:23,358 --> 00:46:25,920
wooden

1357
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:28,239
most psilocybin dense mushroom on the

1358
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:29,358
planet believe it or not um i think it

1359
00:46:28,239 --> 00:46:31,919
was uh

1360
00:46:29,358 --> 00:46:34,000
discovered i know people discovered it

1361
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:35,760
prior but i think i know paul stamets

1362
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:40,719
from fungi perfect i here in olympia

1363
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:43,200
washington are local hero mycologists

1364
00:46:40,719 --> 00:46:46,318
shout yeah i've actually

1365
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:49,598
hung out with the sun azur several times

1366
00:46:46,318 --> 00:46:52,000
so he was the one that coined the

1367
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:54,960
psilocybin as a resin and named it the

1368
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,719
azi so our 27-mile stretch of beach in

1369
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:57,760
the long beach peninsula of washington

1370
00:46:56,719 --> 00:46:59,679
is actually

1371
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:01,119
as the capital of the world especially

1372
00:46:59,679 --> 00:47:02,719
in around november

1373
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:05,119
you will see people from all over the

1374
00:47:02,719 --> 00:47:06,879
world converging on it i've lived there

1375
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:08,400
i operated several hotels and

1376
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:11,039
restaurants there

1377
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:14,000
one being james beard's old favorite

1378
00:47:11,039 --> 00:47:16,639
restaurant and hotel and i

1379
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:18,159
every year go and pick between six eight

1380
00:47:16,639 --> 00:47:20,400
ten pounds of

1381
00:47:18,159 --> 00:47:21,358
as a residence and dry them and use them

1382
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:23,838
in

1383
00:47:21,358 --> 00:47:25,039
various different things just like

1384
00:47:23,838 --> 00:47:26,078
cannabis

1385
00:47:25,039 --> 00:47:29,119
i like

1386
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:30,640
i microdose daily that going to prison

1387
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:32,400
at 17 you know it's kind of good these

1388
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:33,838
stories ran together but going to prison

1389
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:35,680
at 17

1390
00:47:33,838 --> 00:47:37,679
crushed me it gave me ptsd like you

1391
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:38,960
wouldn't believe it changed all sorts of

1392
00:47:37,679 --> 00:47:41,440
things about a child's life and

1393
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:44,240
perspective so

1394
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:46,480
i live with virginia tsd today and

1395
00:47:44,239 --> 00:47:48,558
society really helps me get through that

1396
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:50,079
and i micro dose daily

1397
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:51,040
and i really

1398
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:52,880
like

1399
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:54,558
the conversation that's going to have to

1400
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:57,119
arise soon i know we're talking about

1401
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:58,640
the howie but this the conversation

1402
00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:01,039
that's going to have to arise soon is

1403
00:47:58,639 --> 00:48:03,039
like the conversation that's that arose

1404
00:48:01,039 --> 00:48:05,279
a couple of years ago you know sun grown

1405
00:48:03,039 --> 00:48:07,119
or light you know light depth you know

1406
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:09,839
all this between the cannabis world and

1407
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:11,358
indoor outdoor and that's lab cultured

1408
00:48:09,838 --> 00:48:13,358
psilocybin

1409
00:48:11,358 --> 00:48:14,239
or wild psilocybin

1410
00:48:13,358 --> 00:48:16,400
and

1411
00:48:14,239 --> 00:48:18,558
i treat myself with both

1412
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:21,599
but part of the psilocybin therapy that

1413
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:24,640
i help push 109 and i-34 with in oregon

1414
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:25,680
for the decriminalization of psilocybin

1415
00:48:24,639 --> 00:48:27,199
is

1416
00:48:25,679 --> 00:48:29,440
part of the therapy is getting out there

1417
00:48:27,199 --> 00:48:31,118
and finding the mushroom

1418
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:33,760
you know if you spend three hours out

1419
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:35,599
there in the dune grass just nature yes

1420
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:38,000
that's part of the therapy that a lot of

1421
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:40,240
people that have ptsd and depression are

1422
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,440
missing and it's like you look at the

1423
00:48:40,239 --> 00:48:42,799
list that they give you you want to

1424
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:44,639
crawl out of your depression the first

1425
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:47,920
thing you do go for a walk and it's like

1426
00:48:44,639 --> 00:48:50,159
hey [ __ ] meditation yeah so go for a

1427
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:51,920
walk and hunt for some mushrooms

1428
00:48:50,159 --> 00:48:53,598
and then the other thing is is that when

1429
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:55,358
you're out there in the dune grass and

1430
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:56,720
you're able to find

1431
00:48:55,358 --> 00:48:59,199
a freshie

1432
00:48:56,719 --> 00:49:00,799
a mushroom that's fresh in psilocybin i

1433
00:48:59,199 --> 00:49:03,759
don't mean one that's been dried in

1434
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:07,519
dehydrator dried in the sun from a

1435
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:10,240
laboratory but a fresh psilocybin dense

1436
00:49:07,519 --> 00:49:11,679
mushroom and put it in your damn mouth

1437
00:49:10,239 --> 00:49:13,838
and eat it

1438
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:15,440
don't make tea don't make anything you

1439
00:49:13,838 --> 00:49:17,358
know a lot of people are like oh i'm

1440
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:19,760
going to go to brazil and i'm going to

1441
00:49:17,358 --> 00:49:22,078
do this ayahuasca and i'm going to drink

1442
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:24,880
iboga and i'm going to do all this

1443
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:24,880
and it's hey

1444
00:49:26,239 --> 00:49:29,519
there's nothing wrong with that and i

1445
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:32,480
have nothing wrong with that but

1446
00:49:29,519 --> 00:49:34,079
i believe that from where my ancestors

1447
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:36,719
came from in italy we didn't have any of

1448
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:38,800
those things we had psilocybin mushrooms

1449
00:49:36,719 --> 00:49:40,639
so i believe therapy should go back to

1450
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:42,240
where your ancestors originated from if

1451
00:49:40,639 --> 00:49:44,239
you've got some latin in you then

1452
00:49:42,239 --> 00:49:45,598
explore those things but if you don't

1453
00:49:44,239 --> 00:49:46,799
don't explore those things because

1454
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:48,960
they're not

1455
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:52,079
made for you chemically

1456
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:53,358
so the psilocybin for me that's a very

1457
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:54,559
interesting i think people are going to

1458
00:49:53,358 --> 00:49:56,239
have to start paying attention to these

1459
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:57,920
things you know what i'm saying but just

1460
00:49:56,239 --> 00:50:00,639
like like what i was trying to get at is

1461
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:02,559
like i well most americans are a big

1462
00:50:00,639 --> 00:50:04,318
melting pot though and

1463
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:06,960
you know they're just a mixture of

1464
00:50:04,318 --> 00:50:08,880
everything so delve down deep oh both of

1465
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:11,519
my grandparents are from south america

1466
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:14,000
okay i need to be doing ayahuasca or but

1467
00:50:11,519 --> 00:50:16,318
my grandparents are islanders or they're

1468
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:18,079
this or they're that you know nobody

1469
00:50:16,318 --> 00:50:20,159
needs to be licking a [ __ ] frog

1470
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:21,599
because that [ __ ] is there was nobody

1471
00:50:20,159 --> 00:50:23,039
that was licking frogs except for people

1472
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:25,119
in arizona when they told us what we

1473
00:50:23,039 --> 00:50:27,358
were getting

1474
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:28,079
so i have a question for you really

1475
00:50:27,358 --> 00:50:30,318
quick

1476
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:32,240
sorry to cut you off there but it it

1477
00:50:30,318 --> 00:50:34,639
goes hand in hand with this so one of

1478
00:50:32,239 --> 00:50:36,719
the things that i've always talked about

1479
00:50:34,639 --> 00:50:39,440
my theory on this

1480
00:50:36,719 --> 00:50:41,439
as far as what foods are good for you

1481
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:43,838
what type of cannabis is good for you i

1482
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:44,800
feel that most people have that sensory

1483
00:50:43,838 --> 00:50:46,400
memory

1484
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:49,599
where they're attracted to a certain

1485
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:51,440
like terpene a certain flavonoid where

1486
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:53,280
their body says hey you need some more

1487
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:54,720
of this or that's why you're craving

1488
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:56,480
something like this

1489
00:50:54,719 --> 00:50:58,399
and i'm glad that people can now tailor

1490
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:00,639
their medicine before when we were

1491
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:02,960
living on the black market it was like

1492
00:51:00,639 --> 00:51:04,318
a strain name was just something we used

1493
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:06,000
to sell what we were getting from the

1494
00:51:04,318 --> 00:51:09,279
dude we were getting it from oh yeah

1495
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:11,519
this is o.g kush this is vanilla [ __ ]

1496
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:13,200
thunder [ __ ] and you know and it's like

1497
00:51:11,519 --> 00:51:16,000
it was just like a sellable of a

1498
00:51:13,199 --> 00:51:17,519
sellable point for bag appeal but now it

1499
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,719
actually matters

1500
00:51:17,519 --> 00:51:21,199
now

1501
00:51:18,719 --> 00:51:23,118
with the medical industry prior to the

1502
00:51:21,199 --> 00:51:25,118
wreck industry for eight ten years in

1503
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:26,318
oregon people can actually say you know

1504
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:28,800
you were saying something about blue

1505
00:51:26,318 --> 00:51:30,880
dream and it's like you know

1506
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:31,760
like that dj short blueberry that came

1507
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:34,318
out of

1508
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:36,800
eugene oregon has led its way into all

1509
00:51:34,318 --> 00:51:38,558
the blue strains and that's because

1510
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:40,800
those med growers you know and i'm not a

1511
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:42,960
grower but i do follow genetics

1512
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:44,720
especially old genetics especially land

1513
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:46,800
race genetics because

1514
00:51:44,719 --> 00:51:48,399
i have to tailor my yes we are going to

1515
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:50,640
be best friends

1516
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:52,639
i have to tailor my medicine too because

1517
00:51:50,639 --> 00:51:53,440
it's like i just don't smoke weed you

1518
00:51:52,639 --> 00:51:56,078
know

1519
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:57,760
carla we got live we've smoked live

1520
00:51:56,079 --> 00:52:00,000
resin now for the past

1521
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:02,319
probably four years solid just live

1522
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,639
resin i haven't smoked flour

1523
00:52:02,318 --> 00:52:06,960
for 18 to 20 years

1524
00:52:04,639 --> 00:52:09,440
after prior to that for the past 20

1525
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:11,679
years it's been bho you know for 15

1526
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:13,679
years it was some raspy ass bhl from up

1527
00:52:11,679 --> 00:52:16,239
here in the pacific northwest but it was

1528
00:52:13,679 --> 00:52:19,838
all we had and it was way better for me

1529
00:52:16,239 --> 00:52:21,759
to smoke bho 20 years ago off a swing

1530
00:52:19,838 --> 00:52:23,279
plate than it was to try to smoke flour

1531
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:24,640
because i had to smoke two ounces of

1532
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:26,880
[ __ ] day to get where my head needed

1533
00:52:24,639 --> 00:52:30,159
to be you know what i mean

1534
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:31,838
and i knew that back in the day

1535
00:52:30,159 --> 00:52:34,239
but the silos have

1536
00:52:31,838 --> 00:52:34,960
micro dosing kind of took away from that

1537
00:52:34,239 --> 00:52:36,479
or

1538
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:38,880
like how much cannabis you need to

1539
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:40,960
consume so carla and i smoke about a

1540
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:42,800
gram and a half between the two of us of

1541
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:46,318
live resin a day

1542
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:47,359
she tends to go for the more gassy type

1543
00:52:46,318 --> 00:52:50,558
of

1544
00:52:47,358 --> 00:52:52,639
gassy wet style live resins i like like

1545
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:55,119
right now i'm smoking lemon sour diesel

1546
00:52:52,639 --> 00:52:56,159
because everybody in vancouver grew that

1547
00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:58,240
for like

1548
00:52:56,159 --> 00:53:01,199
eight years in downtown vancouver here

1549
00:52:58,239 --> 00:53:03,759
so i was used to it it's that particular

1550
00:53:01,199 --> 00:53:07,199
the lemon sour diesel really nice for me

1551
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:09,200
i enjoy it she's smoking agent orange i

1552
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:11,358
believe

1553
00:53:09,199 --> 00:53:13,679
yeah so i like california orange i like

1554
00:53:11,358 --> 00:53:15,598
all those other strains carla grew for a

1555
00:53:13,679 --> 00:53:17,598
long time you know so she's well

1556
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:19,200
well-versed better in the

1557
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:21,680
genetics and the things around here i

1558
00:53:19,199 --> 00:53:23,679
just know what the black market had for

1559
00:53:21,679 --> 00:53:25,519
over the past 25 30 years here in the

1560
00:53:23,679 --> 00:53:27,679
pacific northwest and then of course

1561
00:53:25,519 --> 00:53:29,599
throughout the country but yet the

1562
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:30,639
combination of

1563
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:32,000
good

1564
00:53:30,639 --> 00:53:33,279
live resin

1565
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,199
and

1566
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:37,760
psilocybin therapy

1567
00:53:35,199 --> 00:53:39,838
and trying to eat right trying to do all

1568
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:41,359
the other things right well

1569
00:53:39,838 --> 00:53:45,199
that those are the best things you can

1570
00:53:41,358 --> 00:53:47,039
do and nobody no matter if you're

1571
00:53:45,199 --> 00:53:48,960
getting a paycheck from warner brothers

1572
00:53:47,039 --> 00:53:50,558
studios and have multi-millions in the

1573
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:52,800
bank in the biggest house

1574
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:55,519
those people feel bad too

1575
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:57,680
those people have ailments there's no

1576
00:53:55,519 --> 00:53:59,599
separation between there's no

1577
00:53:57,679 --> 00:54:01,440
they're not better than us because their

1578
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:03,119
house is bigger their [ __ ] bills are

1579
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:05,599
bigger

1580
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:07,039
everybody is the same everybody is

1581
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:08,800
abusive yeah so

1582
00:54:07,039 --> 00:54:10,639
and we all have our different paths in

1583
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:12,800
life and some people just go there a

1584
00:54:10,639 --> 00:54:14,639
little bit quicker yep totally or and

1585
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:15,760
some people have different expectations

1586
00:54:14,639 --> 00:54:19,358
so

1587
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:21,200
my expectations out of cannabis is

1588
00:54:19,358 --> 00:54:22,639
and even psilocybin but moreover

1589
00:54:21,199 --> 00:54:25,358
cannabis because

1590
00:54:22,639 --> 00:54:28,000
we're not legal in all states right now

1591
00:54:25,358 --> 00:54:29,440
we're still got ways to go and

1592
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,679
that the

1593
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:33,679
we need standardization everywhere so

1594
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:35,199
that people so so

1595
00:54:33,679 --> 00:54:36,879
everybody's grandmother in a different

1596
00:54:35,199 --> 00:54:39,919
state isn't having to worry about a

1597
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:41,599
different rule and not worrying about

1598
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:43,599
the other thing is is that

1599
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:44,640
in my states two states oregon and

1600
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:46,400
washington

1601
00:54:44,639 --> 00:54:47,598
and in california i lived in california

1602
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:50,480
growing up too and they pushed it even

1603
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:52,720
quicker medical in california is that

1604
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:54,639
we legalized and recreationalized in

1605
00:54:52,719 --> 00:54:57,519
these states under the auspice of

1606
00:54:54,639 --> 00:54:58,558
medicinal values for cannabis

1607
00:54:57,519 --> 00:55:01,920
but yet

1608
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:04,160
all they are selling us is sugar

1609
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:06,880
you go into the dispensaries in the pot

1610
00:55:04,159 --> 00:55:08,798
shops man and it's bad and we have to

1611
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:11,920
have conversations like this

1612
00:55:08,798 --> 00:55:13,759
so that at least two people go oh wow

1613
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:15,838
wow there is a lot of candy wow they

1614
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:17,760

00:55:15,838 --> 00:55:22,639
and oh wow and this and that and it's

1616
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:22,640
like wow how about just weed

1617
00:55:23,199 --> 00:55:28,719
before we get going i wanted to touch on

1618
00:55:26,159 --> 00:55:30,960

1619
00:55:28,719 --> 00:55:33,679

porcinis or the king elites are highly

1644
00:56:26,239 --> 00:56:29,118

1649
00:56:35,199 --> 00:56:38,558
educational event to be able to

lots of speakers

1695
00:58:04,719 --> 00:58:09,439
this is kind of going to be mirrored

1696
00:58:06,079 --> 00:58:12,240
after that but more driven towards the

1697
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:15,280
azeressence and the long beach peninsula

1698

can find out in these areas me my

1703
00:58:22,239 --> 00:58:26,798
favorite

1704
00:58:23,358 --> 00:58:30,000
my favorite is started last a week and

1705
00:58:26,798 --> 00:58:32,798
it is the pacific golden chanterelle the

1706
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:34,000
white chanterelle and the cascade

1707
00:58:32,798 --> 00:58:35,599
chanterelle

1708
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:37,119
and we actually have a rainbow

1709
00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:39,039
chanterelle here but i don't go after

1710
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:40,798
those i only get like two or three but

1711
00:58:39,039 --> 00:58:43,440
like carla and i picked uh probably

1712
00:58:40,798 --> 00:58:46,480
about 25 30 pounds just the other day

1713
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:49,200
and this weekend we're gonna go to

1714
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:51,440
the lowest lewis river falls in gifford

1715
00:58:49,199 --> 00:58:52,798
pinchot and look for some mushrooms down

1716
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:55,519
there but it's chanterelle season it's

1717
00:58:52,798 --> 00:58:57,599
my favorite as a chef everybody goes

1718
00:58:55,519 --> 00:59:01,039
for a lot of the more exotic more

1719
00:58:57,599 --> 00:59:02,798
expensive harder to find mushrooms but a

1720
00:59:01,039 --> 00:59:04,558
chanterelle is

1721
00:59:02,798 --> 00:59:06,480
one of the most exquisite in taste one

1722
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:08,640
of the most versatile to use it doesn't

1723
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:10,000
have any bugs naturally it's got it's

1724
00:59:08,639 --> 00:59:11,920
immune to any bug so you don't have to

1725
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:14,000
worry about any of that [ __ ] you know

1726
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:17,280
it's got these beautiful apricot tones

1727
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:19,119
to it it's easily pickled easily cooked

1728
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:22,240
and easily eaten for anybody that's like

1729
00:59:19,119 --> 00:59:23,920
ew i don't like mushrooms

1730
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:25,919
so what would you equivalate the flavor

1731
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:27,680
the chanterelle of a chanterelle is like

1732
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:29,519
it's its own it's like

1733
00:59:27,679 --> 00:59:31,039
i couldn't pinpoint

1734
00:59:29,519 --> 00:59:33,280
if you ask me what a porcini or a

1735
00:59:31,039 --> 00:59:34,960
kimboli tasted like i would like it like

1736
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:37,200
the woods like the

1737
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:39,199
good part a good point yeah

1738
00:59:37,199 --> 00:59:41,199
like the earth that's growing in like

1739
00:59:39,199 --> 00:59:42,719
you can pull out

1740
00:59:41,199 --> 00:59:44,719
like if your palettes really train you

1741
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:47,279
can pull out some like apricot

1742
00:59:44,719 --> 00:59:49,519
undertones some nutty nutty nutty

1743
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:51,359
undertones to it um but nothing in

1744
00:59:49,519 --> 00:59:53,838
particular it's really

1745
00:59:51,358 --> 00:59:55,920
where and how that chanterelle was grown

1746
00:59:53,838 --> 00:59:58,558
um this past weekend we picked uh white

1747
00:59:55,920 --> 01:00:00,400
chanterelles and i'll tell you what they

1748
00:59:58,559 --> 01:00:02,079
even they're like

1749
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:04,160
they're going they're going crazy this

1750
01:00:02,079 --> 01:00:06,880
year because of the weather the weather

1751
01:00:04,159 --> 01:00:08,399
each year we get a new like flush of

1752
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:11,200
what's going to come in a heavy thing

1753
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:13,200
like like two years ago we drove over

1754
01:00:11,199 --> 01:00:15,199
where you over by where you live because

1755
01:00:13,199 --> 01:00:17,439
you had a lot of wildfires and the

1756
01:00:15,199 --> 01:00:18,960
morels the burn morels were prevalent

1757
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:21,519
over there

1758
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:23,280
i was gonna say that's pretty cool that

1759
01:00:21,519 --> 01:00:24,960
you're into the chanterelles because

1760
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:27,119
everybody around here is about the morel

1761
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:29,679
yeah no see it's actually my

1762
01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:32,318
it's not my least favorite but it's my

1763
01:00:29,679 --> 01:00:34,159
my least favorite is a big

1764
01:00:32,318 --> 01:00:36,558
big king bolete or porcini because it's

1765
01:00:34,159 --> 01:00:38,480
going to be buggy and i got to dry it

1766
01:00:36,559 --> 01:00:41,040
you like some of those you just want to

1767
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:43,199
slice and eat but i like chanterelles

1768

1809
01:02:08,798 --> 01:02:13,038
occasion

1810
01:02:09,838 --> 01:02:15,920
and i like micheladas oh yeah and

1811
01:02:13,039 --> 01:02:17,359
you posted about a marijuana michelle oh

1812
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:19,440
yeah

1813
01:02:17,358 --> 01:02:20,639
tell me about this so you can do it in

1814
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:22,240
two ways

1815
01:02:20,639 --> 01:02:24,318
actually one of my favorites like i said

1816
01:02:22,239 --> 01:02:26,959
build the cannabis pantry you know if

1817
01:02:24,318 --> 01:02:29,119
you like absent make some absinthe

1818
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:30,480
infused and if you don't want to make it

1819
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:32,880
in the machine do it the old way and

1820
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:34,798
just de-carb some bud put your favorite

1821
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:38,240
rum whiskey

1822
01:02:34,798 --> 01:02:39,920
liquor into a mason jar with the decarb

1823
01:02:38,239 --> 01:02:42,000
bud and let it sit there it's alcohol

1824
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:44,639
it's got acid in it it's got alcohol in

1825
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:46,559
it it's gonna it's got extraction uh

1826
01:02:44,639 --> 01:02:48,639
opportunities available you know

1827
01:02:46,559 --> 01:02:50,400
everybody i know and i'm going to veer

1828
01:02:48,639 --> 01:02:52,400
off for a little bit

1829
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:55,039
what about with the beer though because

1830
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:56,720
that's only what three and a half to i

1831
01:02:55,039 --> 01:02:59,039
think the max that we have in washington

1832
01:02:56,719 --> 01:03:01,038
is like so with the with that you would

1833
01:02:59,039 --> 01:03:03,200
really you want to add it to your other

1834
01:03:01,039 --> 01:03:04,720
ingredients you want to add to your salt

1835
01:03:03,199 --> 01:03:07,358
you want to add it to your you know

1836
01:03:04,719 --> 01:03:09,038
whatever you can get it in

1837
01:03:07,358 --> 01:03:10,960
in that situation

1838
01:03:09,039 --> 01:03:12,960
we in particular

1839
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:16,400
have it in our hot sauce

1840
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:17,838
so that's the way that i we made that

1841
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:19,760
okay what i'm saying

1842
01:03:17,838 --> 01:03:22,239
so you're you're making your hot sauce

1843
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:25,680
with the vinegar exactly and actually

1844
01:03:22,239 --> 01:03:28,479
the hot sauce that i made was not only

1845
01:03:25,679 --> 01:03:31,440
made with cannabis vinegar it's two-tone

1846
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:34,000
so it was the peppers were fermented

1847
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:36,318
then decarb weed the peppers and liquid

1848
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:38,400
was added to the magical butter machine

1849
01:03:36,318 --> 01:03:41,440
which is i put it on no heat at that

1850
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:43,760
point in time and just did the puree

1851
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:46,240
then i put it on low heat which is about

1852
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:48,319
60 and did an hour

1853
01:03:46,239 --> 01:03:51,118
then let that cook then i just strained

1854
01:03:48,318 --> 01:03:53,279
it out no particles of bud or no color

1855
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:56,000
left because i used wajio peppers

1856
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:57,440
they're all dark so you can't even see

1857
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:59,519
if there was flakes of butter in it but

1858
01:03:57,440 --> 01:04:00,559
then now it's double tone

1859
01:03:59,519 --> 01:04:01,759
it's got

1860
01:04:00,559 --> 01:04:03,359
the d carp

1861
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:05,359
are you trying to bring that flavor

1862
01:04:03,358 --> 01:04:07,279
through too a lot of

1863
01:04:05,358 --> 01:04:08,960
people don't like it a lot of people are

1864
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:11,039
they're really scared of it and a lot of

1865
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:13,119
people will get like a little toothpick

1866
01:04:11,039 --> 01:04:15,039
of rso on their tongue and freak out and

1867
01:04:13,119 --> 01:04:16,559
be like oh my god and it's still on my

1868
01:04:15,039 --> 01:04:18,400
tooth and oh my god

1869
01:04:16,559 --> 01:04:21,839
i love it

1870
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:23,519
rso can be bad you can have bad rso

1871
01:04:21,838 --> 01:04:25,838
but there's some really clearly but some

1872
01:04:23,519 --> 01:04:27,358
people like their like you know it's

1873
01:04:25,838 --> 01:04:29,279
like some people are like oh i want to

1874
01:04:27,358 --> 01:04:31,358
smoke cannabis but i don't want to smoke

1875
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:32,798
it and all right oh i want to eat

1876
01:04:31,358 --> 01:04:34,159
cannabis but i don't want to eat it and

1877
01:04:32,798 --> 01:04:36,318
it's like just make up your damn mind

1878
01:04:34,159 --> 01:04:37,038
and get over your fear hurdle and just

1879
01:04:36,318 --> 01:04:38,798
say

1880
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:41,119
nobody's died yet

1881
01:04:38,798 --> 01:04:42,159
and you're not the room's going to spin

1882
01:04:41,119 --> 01:04:44,160
you're going to want to go to sleep

1883
01:04:42,159 --> 01:04:45,038
that's the worst thing you know

1884
01:04:44,159 --> 01:04:46,879
so

1885
01:04:45,039 --> 01:04:48,079
yeah so with the beer

1886
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:49,920
i would def

1887
01:04:48,079 --> 01:04:52,318
make some hot sauce

1888
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:54,400
and then made your red beer out of that

1889
01:04:52,318 --> 01:04:55,519
and you can uh if you want to make the

1890
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:58,400
sugars and

1891
01:04:55,519 --> 01:05:02,239
the salts out of alcohol-based tinctures

1892
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:04,880
by any means you can and just add layers

1893
01:05:02,239 --> 01:05:07,118
what do you find yourself typically

1894
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:09,519
substituting sugar with

1895
01:05:07,119 --> 01:05:10,880
i know you shouted out vanilla agave

1896
01:05:09,519 --> 01:05:13,119
nectar

1897
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:15,519
but i'll tell you what so okay i'm a

1898
01:05:13,119 --> 01:05:17,920
type 1 diabetic i just became a type 1

1899
01:05:15,519 --> 01:05:19,358
diabetic i was a type 2 diabetic like a

1900
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:21,280
year ago and just became a type 1

1901
01:05:19,358 --> 01:05:22,558
diabetic and

1902
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:24,480
are you going to talk about the sun

1903
01:05:22,559 --> 01:05:26,880
syrups right now yeah i know i got a jar

1904
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:29,039
out there right now ah damn sunscreens

1905
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:31,599
and agave nectars and all that that

1906
01:05:29,039 --> 01:05:33,440
those are really the ways that you

1907
01:05:31,599 --> 01:05:34,798
can and if some people are like me and

1908
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:36,960
they can't get away from like a little

1909
01:05:34,798 --> 01:05:40,079
bit of sugar and actually i need to have

1910
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:40,960
it around to direct my sugar believe it

1911
01:05:40,079 --> 01:05:42,400
or not

1912
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:44,159
because if you're up you're up if you're

1913
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:45,760
down you're down you need sugar one way

1914
01:05:44,159 --> 01:05:46,558
you know one for one and one for the

1915
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:47,359
other

1916
01:05:46,559 --> 01:05:48,400
but

1917
01:05:47,358 --> 01:05:50,558
i would

1918
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:52,480
if people can get move away from the

1919
01:05:50,559 --> 01:05:54,400
hidden sugars they don't necessarily

1920
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:55,519
need to take the sugar jar off of their

1921
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:57,760
counter

1922
01:05:55,519 --> 01:05:59,280
but if they can get rid of the if they

1923
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:01,599
can just be more conscious about the

1924
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:03,519
things like like a hamburger just isn't

1925
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:05,440
a hamburger the bun has got like 30

1926
01:06:03,519 --> 01:06:08,079
grams of sugar in it

1927
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:10,480
but if you go to a non-sugar bun like

1928
01:06:08,079 --> 01:06:12,798
say an egg bun like a hawaiian roll or a

1929
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:14,318
potato bun or something they've even got

1930
01:06:12,798 --> 01:06:17,199
less sugar in them because they're made

1931
01:06:14,318 --> 01:06:18,798
with another ingredient like a potato

1932
01:06:17,199 --> 01:06:20,480
oh yeah and potato bread is like the

1933
01:06:18,798 --> 01:06:22,480
best totally

1934
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:24,240
i just recommend people think think

1935
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:25,838
about what they want to do think about

1936
01:06:24,239 --> 01:06:28,479
how they want to do it and think about

1937
01:06:25,838 --> 01:06:30,400
what level of convenience they want to

1938
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:32,559
work with when it comes to cannabinoids

1939
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:35,440
and having that pantry available and

1940
01:06:32,559 --> 01:06:35,440
buying products

1941
01:06:35,519 --> 01:06:39,759
yeah absolutely

1942
01:06:37,119 --> 01:06:42,720
and on that note i think we will end the

1943
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:45,599
