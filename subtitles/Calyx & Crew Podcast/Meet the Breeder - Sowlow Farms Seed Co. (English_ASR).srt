genetics for cannabis

75
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,239
it's been

76
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:45,518
a huge passion of mine as far back as i

77
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,200
can remember

78
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:50,080
and that's why

79
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:51,518

83
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:00,719
cash makers and

84
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,680
extremely beautiful flour

85
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:06,878
with older things things that are unique

86
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,400
to just me or my area

87
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:09,518
of the country

88
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,439
and

89
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:14,000
put a different swing with some

90
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:16,000
familiar things that people know from

91
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,560
all over the country try to put my own

92
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,318
little twist on it hell yeah when were

93
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,318
those beginning phases when did you get

94
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:24,479
into growing cannabis

95
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:26,719
oh so growing

96
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:29,119
uh first time growing

97
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:31,199
uh i want to say that was

98
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:35,480
it was outside

99
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:35,479
and i want to say that was 1992.

100
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:41,839
just me and the buddy

101
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:43,039
had some seeds we found in bags you know

102
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,719
i mean that's what

103
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:46,400
you had seen back in the day and i was

104
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:48,239
like man i'd really like to see if we

105
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,120
could grow our own

106
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,200
and

107
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,878
during those years in the summer time it

108
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:54,639
was always a drought

109
00:03:52,878 --> 00:03:56,959
so we're like well i'll take some of

110
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:59,759
these seeds and start growing

111
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:01,360
our own maybe we could supplement at the

112
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:02,798
end of the year you know

113
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,439
yeah just kids

114
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:07,120
yeah just young guys just playing around

115
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:08,878
and seeing what we could do

116
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,920
and i guess that's kind of sparked it

117
00:04:08,878 --> 00:04:11,039
man because

118
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:14,238
we ended up

119
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:16,478
you know actually doing okay and first

120
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,000
time doing it like oh wow this is so

121
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:20,238
cool you know

122
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,120
and we just back then all you would see

123
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:25,839
is coming in a bag or a brick

124
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,680
and then to actually see the plant

125
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:29,839
looking like something we used to see it

126
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,240
in high times magazines

127
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:33,758
was just crazy to me

128
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,000
for sure

129
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:38,400
yeah what were some of those first

130
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,759
cultivars that you fell in love with

131
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:41,679
oh god

132
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:44,800
some of the first ones i want to say

133
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:47,360
like playing around with as far as like

134
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:50,960
like back then it was like mexican

135
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:53,040
indicators sativas you know

136
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:55,120
land racy stuff and then

137
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,919
we had some buddies that

138
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,439
up north in northern new england that

139
00:04:57,918 --> 00:05:01,599
were doing it

140
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:03,279
a little bit longer like their dads were

141
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,639
or their family were

142
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:06,239
like my own

143
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,280
and we ended up getting a couple cuts

144
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,079
and stuff

145
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:09,918
and

146
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:13,198
you know through black market getting

147
00:05:09,918 --> 00:05:14,079
seeds from different various ways

148
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,478
just

149
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:17,758
unique things i'd say rock bud was one

150
00:05:16,478 --> 00:05:21,758
of them

151
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:25,038
from soma yep new york city diesel

152
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:27,199
and just so many god blood i mean

153
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:29,680
an adult vida

154
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:32,160
was that somas nycd

155
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,918
yeah that was a good one new york city

156
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,800
diesel

157
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:39,758
which i did earlier work with

158
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,879
unfortunately we never i took it to like

159
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,319
f2

160
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:44,719
and

161
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:47,279
because of that chem family

162
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,840
it just always seemed to carry

163
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:52,399
some hermaphroditic traits yep so we

164
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:54,399
just kind of left it alone

165
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:57,198
you would find some really nice things

166
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:59,359
but if you weren't adamant enough or if

167
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:01,439
you went away for the day

168
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,720
and came back and something happened it

169
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:04,879
just you know it was just something that

170
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,280
we didn't wanna and back then i just

171
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:09,680
didn't know enough to really

172
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:12,239
say hey stress test these things in

173
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,759
different ways you know and all the time

174
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,519
reading about it

175
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,479
obviously friends like

176
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:17,519
chris

177
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:20,560
helping

178
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:22,478
in so many different ways just dropping

179
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,759
these little knowledge bombs every once

180
00:06:22,478 --> 00:06:26,318
in a while

181
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:28,240
on me during conversations

182
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,720
helped improve that and then asking

183
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:34,720
questions and then just going for it too

184
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:36,800
man yeah breeding cannabis is definitely

185
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,120
for looking for certain things is so

186
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:42,879
much different than just like growing

187
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:45,840
cannabis only for flower absolutely

188
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:48,879
so many different components to it

189
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:50,959
and you know hopefully i think a lot of

190
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:53,598
people when they get it if they crying

191
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:56,318
into it or even just like a novice just

192
00:06:53,598 --> 00:06:58,478
home grower saying man these two things

193
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,000
are really nice and to be honest with

194
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:02,240
you everybody out

195
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
there that was that is a breeder or

196
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,918
upcoming breeder

197
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,038
we were all in that same spot at one

198
00:07:05,918 --> 00:07:09,120
point

199
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:10,159
and just saying man these are really

200
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,199
nice

201
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,800
and

202
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,800
you know i think back then too a lot of

203
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,598
people were nervous about

204
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:20,160
ordering seeds online it was sketchy

205
00:07:17,598 --> 00:07:22,240
yeah years ago i think certain people

206
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,560
were just making their own having

207
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,720
something that stood out in their area

208
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,560
and said hey we did this

209
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,120
you know and over the years obviously it

210
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,639
just has gotten so much more intricate

211
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,399
when i do it

212
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:37,598
i look for

213
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:39,598
depending on what i'm using and what the

214
00:07:37,598 --> 00:07:43,519
i guess the end result

215
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:46,878
at least of that particular project is

216
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:49,680
as far as like a goal like an end goal

217
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:52,400
stability of male what does that male

218
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,199
and lineage bring to the table

219
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:54,799
it's

220
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,919
not just because of the strain that i

221
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,680
like

222
00:07:55,918 --> 00:07:59,758
it has a lot of different components

223
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,000
medicinal value

224
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,680
everything like that man uh

225
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,120
is it a short growing plant that i'm

226
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:08,560
going to try to put it with and pair it

227
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:10,720
with as a female and this male

228
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,399
has a lot more vigor and i can open it

229
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:15,360
up and maybe get the

230
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:17,918
veg time a little faster you know

231
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,160
all those little different intricacies

232
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:22,399
yeah for sure yeah

233
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:25,360
the cool thing about breeding is i find

234
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:27,279
it's much like art like every breeder's

235
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,038
got their own little flair their own

236
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:31,119
little fling that they kind of throw on

237
00:08:29,038 --> 00:08:33,278
things and that's kind of what attracts

238
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,200
us to these certain people i'm still

239
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:36,879
kind in those beginning stages still

240
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,479
learning about breeding

241
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:40,639
and one of the things that i've

242
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,560
definitely picked up is that when you've

243
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:44,480
got a project in mind you have to have

244
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:46,159
your goals right because you have to

245
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,639
have those boxes that it meets those

246
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:50,639
expectations and anything that doesn't

247
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:52,399
automatically make those expectations

248
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:53,759
it's gone right

249
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,440
yeah you can't waste a kid you don't

250
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:56,639
want to put any more energy and time

251
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,120
into it

252
00:08:56,639 --> 00:09:01,838
absolutely so i wanted to ask you

253
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:04,560
for you what's your artistic touch what

254
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:06,000
are those boxes that you know every

255
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:07,759
project is going to have some a little

256
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,080
bit different is there anything that you

257
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:11,039
find that box is consistently going

258
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,879
through

259
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:14,879
all of your cultivar cultivars

260
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:17,519
everything that you're producing are you

261
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:19,278
going for terps are you going for

262
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,560
resin return

263
00:09:19,278 --> 00:09:22,559
just so

264
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:23,919
always resin return

265
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:26,479
and terps

266
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:29,199
pretty much the the most important part

267
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:32,399
the medicinal part of that plant

268
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,680
don't get me wrong i love an amazing

269
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:36,559
flower

270
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:39,519
looking at amazing boutique

271
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:42,239
or artisanal style flower

272
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:44,320
especially nowadays in this new market

273
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,080
with so many stores

274
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,640
and people

275
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:52,160
it's so much easier for them to

276
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:55,278
go in and look at something pretty

277
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:57,519
versus you know catches their eye

278
00:09:55,278 --> 00:10:00,320
it's beautiful yeah

279
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:02,799
the biggest thing for me with

280
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:05,120
let's just say the skittles blissful was

281
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:06,719
a product project that i did

282
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,200
that mail

283
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,639
just added figure

284
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:14,079
stack

285
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:16,480
that mail just stacked really well

286
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:18,719
um super resilient

287
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,360
to pests

288
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,600
lighting heat stresses

289
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,600
cold stresses

290
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,000
food stresses like

291
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,159
overwatering underwatering all those

292
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,278
different things just kind of chugs

293
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:34,799
right through not super picky

294
00:10:33,278 --> 00:10:38,639
but the biggest

295
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:42,000
thing about him was adding resin

296
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:44,159
just really packing in resin in all

297
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,720
those little areas where

298
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:48,719
certain strains because of the

299
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,160
head size or the

300
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,240
just what it is

301
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:53,759
it's there it looks beautiful but you

302
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,200
know there's certain ones that just

303
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:56,159
really back in

304
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,160
right

305
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:59,838
that's really my biggest thing like i'm

306
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:00,879
growing for

307
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:02,320
cash

308
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:03,679
that's what i want

309
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,320
and hash

310
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:08,159
i love tasty beautiful

311
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,440
good producing

312
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:12,078
cash

313
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,920
that people are going to enjoy

314
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:16,239
and that growers want to grow because

315
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:18,240
they can actually get a yield

316
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,799
that was really something and just

317
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,480
because i paired them with certain ones

318
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:25,199
even though i

319
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:27,600
with all testing and then growing these

320
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,040
all out and then doing washes on

321
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,360
everything

322
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:33,519
doesn't mean that that my mail even

323
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,560
though i put it to it's gonna always

324
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:36,399
link up

325
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:38,159
right you know it's not a guarantee

326
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,440
nothing's guaranteed

327
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:40,838
i think

328
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:44,079
my

329
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:45,360
intention had some what to do with it

330
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:47,120
and then just

331
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,399
man it was a you know just putting in

332
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,519
the time

333
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:53,519
and really watching and and then also

334
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:56,399
picking specific

335
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:59,519
females that just had excellent

336
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:01,278
properties already and it's just like i

337
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,959
said i'll say it again it doesn't

338
00:12:01,278 --> 00:12:05,039
guarantee you anything

339
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:06,239
but it's definitely a good step forward

340
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:07,759
and to

341
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,600
the end goal

342
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:11,519
i don't know man i wouldn't downplay it

343
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,200
too much i grew that mountain wizard

344
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,519
from you

345
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:18,480
and every single one of those females

346
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,480
was a resin hog

347
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:23,120
even at the end of the day that you

348
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:25,680
could get the best of each combine them

349
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,519
sometimes it just does not work right

350
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:28,879
like chris has told me so many times

351
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,240
like man we have all the right

352
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:32,480
intentions

353
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,839
and this is what i remember from this

354
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,240
one and then when you pair it up but

355
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:37,680
sometimes they just don't think well

356
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,159
yeah and

357
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:41,278
by the grace of god and a little bit of

358
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:43,838
luck

359
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:44,879
and with some foresight i guess and a

360
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:47,279
little help

361
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:48,799
man it just worked bro that's all i got

362
00:12:47,278 --> 00:12:49,679
to do

363
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:52,719
and

364
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:55,679
the positive feedback and i guess you

365
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,639
know another thing that maybe helped too

366
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:58,159
is

367
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,480
before even

368
00:12:58,159 --> 00:13:01,519
releasing these projects and showing

369
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,639
people

370
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:07,200
on the solo farms page like hey this was

371
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:09,600
the great buy this is this this is this

372
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,399
and showing them and then working with

373
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,879
those

374
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:15,600
products and then having availability to

375
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:17,360
them you know to keep people and

376
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,680
getting it out there so people can

377
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,200
actually try it and then know

378
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:23,199
and then i think

379
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,959
coming out with a product that i made

380
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,720
myself with some of these ones that they

381
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:28,479
were already enjoying

382
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,680
just kind of paired well man it just

383
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,879
worked out

384
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:32,719
brother

385
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:35,120
it just really did

386
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,399
i think about it a lot and i'm just like

387
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,078
wow you know

388
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:39,120
at least with that particular one

389
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:42,000
because

390
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:44,159
i did enough work with it but like i

391
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,078
said it doesn't guarantee you anything

392
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:49,278
now if i was talking about

393
00:13:46,078 --> 00:13:52,078
maybe the grapefruit work epic

394
00:13:49,278 --> 00:13:55,360
there's been so many years of that

395
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:58,479
since 2010 i mean i got me a buddy got

396
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:01,919
the seeds in 2005 for those

397
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:03,199
out at the uh amsterdam high times cup

398
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:06,078
and

399
00:14:03,198 --> 00:14:07,838
i think around 2 000

400
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:10,000
9 10

401
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:10,639
is when we started playing around with

402
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,360
them

403
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:15,519
we did them inside outside

404
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,360
found some really nice things

405
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:19,278
found a nice nail

406
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,278
did some preservation where we could

407
00:14:19,278 --> 00:14:22,480
keep more of the genetics and goats to

408
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:24,320
go through

409
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,000
uh for further work just because it did

410
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,000
so amazing

411
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,879
up here outside

412
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,559
it just seemed like man this thing's so

413
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:35,278
strong she's

414
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:37,679
super healthy super vigorous

415
00:14:35,278 --> 00:14:39,439
man let's try to i think this would work

416
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:40,479
really well with some other stuff that

417
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,560
we have

418
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,519
you know at the current time

419
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:45,759
and

420
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:46,480
so we you know i think we brought it up

421
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:48,879
to

422
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,320
2015 we had about five years of work

423
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:52,399
with it

424
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,320
every year we did some populations of

425
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:57,519
inferior amounts

426
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,560
finally came and narrowed down to f2s

427
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:00,480
in

428
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:04,278
oh god i want to say we finished that up

429
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,278
in the fall of 2014

430
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:10,319
and then

431
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:14,559
chris had come out in 2015

432
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:16,720
for a mmcm show and

433
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:19,518
you know we were doing the seed booth so

434
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:21,040
he came out for the weekend and

435
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,720
just funny story he was like yeah i

436
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:24,559
brought this up let's try this and it

437
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,720
was charlotte's web

438
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:29,198
and one of his buddies

439
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:32,800
that was actually doing the extraction

440
00:15:29,198 --> 00:15:34,399
had a cut of this grapefruit from steve

441
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:36,879
and it was amazing

442
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,799
so he was like hey instead of

443
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:40,639
me running mine separately why don't we

444
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:42,639
just put ours both together i think it'd

445
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,839
be super tasty and

446
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:46,000
really medicinal from the

447
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:47,040
charlottesville christmas like yeah sure

448
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,839
cool

449
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:52,319
so friday night we get out of the

450
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:53,440
show we smoke some and we're smoking it

451
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,360
all night

452
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,560
then saturday comes around and there was

453
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,039
a bunch of us

454
00:15:56,559 --> 00:16:00,638
in the hotel room just hanging out and

455
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:03,120
we're smoking and i'm like man this

456
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:06,320
would be just kind of crazy

457
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,919
because i'm like you have the showers

458
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,959
yeah uh the charlotte's web and he's

459
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:13,039
like yeah i was like man i was like

460
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:14,719
you know as far as bro wise obviously

461
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:17,039
not medicinal wise

462
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,519
so he was you know giving me some

463
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:20,480
backstory on her and how it was for him

464
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:22,399
and

465
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:25,199
he was like man you know i'd almost

466
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,639
think about getting that cut and maybe

467
00:16:25,198 --> 00:16:27,599
doing something with that i was like

468
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:30,560
well

469
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,680
here chris i got grapefruit f2s that we

470
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:33,518
have

471
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:35,198
and i'd love to put some in your hand

472
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:38,000
let's do like

473
00:16:35,198 --> 00:16:39,838
let's do some collab work and maybe

474
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,278
hopefully end up finding something and

475
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:45,440
then read like let's make this straight

476
00:16:43,278 --> 00:16:48,320
it's super delicious and it made us feel

477
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,839
good all weekend absolutely you guys

478
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,320
knocked it out of the park on that one

479
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:53,440
i'm really glad you brought that up

480
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,199
i think

481
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:58,240
one of the things that is my like

482
00:16:55,198 --> 00:16:59,758
paintbrush to the canvas for me

483
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,680
is

484
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:03,120
a couple really good friends with

485
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:06,399
knowledge

486
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:08,640
me obviously having some heirs to listen

487
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,559
but my eye man

488
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,079
and i don't know where i got it from i

489
00:17:10,558 --> 00:17:14,000
just have it

490
00:17:12,078 --> 00:17:16,720
some people got it

491
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,558
an eye for cannabis man to watch how

492
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:21,120
these girls grow

493
00:17:18,558 --> 00:17:22,639
and i guess i i i guess they can't kind

494
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:25,038
of came out of

495
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,079
necessity because in the building in the

496
00:17:25,038 --> 00:17:28,160
beginning

497
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:31,359
when i first started doing this

498
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:34,320
having like you know smaller children

499
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:36,959
being super discreet limited spacing

500
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:39,759
yeah really paying attention to what i

501
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:42,640
needed and what i could use

502
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:44,240
so i guess that kind of help narrows

503
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,480
down those easter eggs quick when you

504
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,079
gotta get [ __ ] out because you need room

505
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,558
right

506
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:53,759
yeah and it just i think it heightens

507
00:17:50,558 --> 00:17:56,399
certain senses more than others because

508
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:57,839
at least that's how i feel and

509
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,240
i think that's a

510
00:17:57,839 --> 00:18:02,720
probably why some of it and then just i

511
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:05,599
love this plant man this plant is just

512
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,880
no matter what from a young age always

513
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:09,678
helped me

514
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,600
and so many other people around me

515
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:13,360
and i'm like man and obviously you know

516
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:16,319
as young kids

517
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:18,479
like mid 80s and through the 90s looking

518
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:20,000
at high times and you're seeing all this

519
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:23,038
and these guys are like wow they're so

520
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,798
underground and this is so cool like

521
00:18:23,038 --> 00:18:28,240
we're getting brickweed back here but

522
00:18:24,798 --> 00:18:30,480
these guys on cali are crushing it and

523
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:32,558
just seeing all those

524
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,720
different all the different expressions

525
00:18:32,558 --> 00:18:36,798
of this this plant

526
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:39,038
and i'm like man i'd

527
00:18:36,798 --> 00:18:40,160
i'd really love one day to be able to

528
00:18:39,038 --> 00:18:42,319
say

529
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:44,720
i've found some unique things and then

530
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:47,359
things that are familiar to people

531
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:49,839
and i can maybe hopefully make

532
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:51,359
some of that for not only myself but

533
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:53,599
maybe to share

534
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:56,000
and then in sharing

535
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:58,959
um that's how it all started just like

536
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,119
making some beans super early projects

537
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:03,360
knowing what i'm looking for but

538
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:05,678
maybe not having a super end goal just

539
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:07,439
open expressions but knowing what's

540
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:10,320
there is really good

541
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:12,000
passing out a lot of free seeds it's

542
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:14,319
almost like paying your dues when you're

543
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,480
getting into breeding right

544
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:18,480
yeah and just like putting them into

545
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,798
people that i look kind of i looked up

546
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,960
to and then other people in my same

547
00:19:20,798 --> 00:19:25,359
position or people that maybe you're

548
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:27,519
just starting out and saying here man i

549
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:29,439
know it's tight during springtime you're

550
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:31,440
gonna spend money on this and this this

551
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,279
this and this here's some seeds go try

552
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,400
some of these they've done really well

553
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:36,079
for me

554
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:39,038
hopefully you know we're in the same

555
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:41,439
climate and area let's see if you like

556
00:19:39,038 --> 00:19:43,279
them too just adam you know just a few

557
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,558
of something different

558
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:46,480
and uh

559
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:48,720
i don't know just with that it just kind

560
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,480
of worked out really well you know

561
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,160
yeah just kind of fell into place i

562
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,079
guess little bits at a time it

563
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,759
definitely takes time i've been

564
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:58,079
extremely happy with everything that

565
00:19:55,759 --> 00:20:01,279
we've grown from you and i don't want to

566
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:03,678
quite get off i could praise you forever

567
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:05,200
on the mountain wizard and we we're

568
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:06,400
definitely going to get into some of the

569
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,000
other stuff that you're working with but

570
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,360
i want to get back to that grapefruit

571
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,400
really quick

572
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:12,959
you

573
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,960
and p had completely different

574
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:18,079
cuts of the grapefruit right

575
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:21,600
what made what happened there

576
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:25,439
well chris ended up taking finding uh

577
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:26,959
an amazing male out of the f2 style

578
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,798
that i gave him

579
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,640
because at the time i was

580
00:20:28,798 --> 00:20:32,158
building my new building and everything

581
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,320
and i said chris i got to kind of take a

582
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:35,919
backdrop of this but if you want to you

583
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:37,759
have an amazing eye and if i was going

584
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:40,159
to trust anyone

585
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:41,200
with these i would you know my brother

586
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,480
yeah

587
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,200
and um

588
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:47,279
and chris has that eye plus

589
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,360
so i knew that i was more than confident

590
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:51,839
that chris would take it to the next

591
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:53,918
level really and definitely do it

592
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:56,319
justice but keep in mind

593
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:58,559
of where i was going to

594
00:20:56,319 --> 00:21:00,558
and keeping it open a little bit

595
00:20:58,558 --> 00:21:02,399
and i think in the beginning chris he

596
00:21:00,558 --> 00:21:04,000
kept it open and then you know seeing

597
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,519
some really cool

598
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,200
things that he had in his table like

599
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:09,839
that durbin

600
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,679
some of the older stuff and you know

601
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:13,359
with coming out with that new relic line

602
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:15,600
it just seemed to kill

603
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:18,399
it was just the right timing everything

604
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:19,678
just kind of in it and now you're at f4

605
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:24,080
right

606
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:26,798
um f4 is uh working i'm i actually

607
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:30,558
went back in on f2s

608
00:21:26,798 --> 00:21:32,798
okay doing a large population

609
00:21:30,558 --> 00:21:35,519
and f4s

610
00:21:32,798 --> 00:21:38,319
and going back through now

611
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:41,200
hopefully we'll see how things are by

612
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:42,079
fall i should be able to start getting

613
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,519
the

614
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:46,879
f5s into testing is the

615
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:48,240
goal

616
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,320
whether

617
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,319
that completely works out is all on what

618
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:55,119
we're finding now

619
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:56,079
from those f2s to this f4 that you're at

620
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:58,798
now

621
00:21:56,079 --> 00:22:00,879
what's changed in the in the phenotypes

622
00:21:58,798 --> 00:22:02,480
and the or i should say genotype so

623
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,840
what's changing the genotypes are we

624
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,319
seeing more

625
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:08,879
like the sweet pink grapefruit are we

626
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:10,798
seeing more of both the sweet pink and

627
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:13,679
the inbred line type of stuff what's

628
00:22:10,798 --> 00:22:14,798
going on so like when chris was doing

629
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:16,960
his

630
00:22:14,798 --> 00:22:19,359
he had a certain

631
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:22,720
flavor that he was looking for

632
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:24,000
and he had a really nice sweet pinky

633
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,839
grapefruit

634
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,798
and he knew that's what i really liked

635
00:22:25,839 --> 00:22:28,480
like

636
00:22:26,798 --> 00:22:31,038
with like a little bit of funk in it and

637
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,880
i think chris was looking more of that

638
00:22:31,038 --> 00:22:35,599
sour like

639
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:37,200
yeah funky grapefruit like

640
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:39,199
more gassy

641
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,120
and so that's where

642
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,038
he wanted to take

643
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:43,918
his part of the work

644
00:22:43,038 --> 00:22:46,480
too

645
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:48,000
thus the relic grapefruit

646
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,679
using a

647
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,720
that same cut

648
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:55,600
that was in the oil that sparked the

649
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:57,919
whole thing up went back to that

650
00:22:55,599 --> 00:23:00,399
mutual buddy and ended up doing some

651
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:02,880
work with that cut which was

652
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:05,120
thieves cut of the grapefruit

653
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:08,159
and i mean it all comes from that same

654
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:10,879
lineage even my seeds it's just i've

655
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:13,120
used stuff that i find

656
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:15,039
and what we enjoy right

657
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:17,038
when it came time to

658
00:23:15,038 --> 00:23:19,359
do the f4s

659
00:23:17,038 --> 00:23:20,960
i've only released

660
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:24,240
the a

661
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:25,919
uh version so i have a through d

662
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,200
on the f4s

663
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:30,320
and

664
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:32,319
i basically did it so i wanted to keep

665
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:35,119
my expressions open i didn't want to

666
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:36,720
bottleneck it into just one thing

667
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:39,918
because i want to

668
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:41,919
get these out there and see what

669
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:44,720
now i know what i like

670
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:46,799
but people that are grabbing my gear

671
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,400
they might want that open expression

672
00:23:46,798 --> 00:23:50,558
because they've seen it

673
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:53,120
my version of it chris's version of it

674
00:23:50,558 --> 00:23:55,119
and then obviously multiple hybrids

675
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:57,759
so what when i was

676
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:59,759
pairing females with that male i ended

677
00:23:57,759 --> 00:24:02,079
up taking a sweet pink grapefruit that

678
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:03,519
was like short and stocky more

679
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:06,000
indica growth

680
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:07,278
and then a more sativa more faster

681
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,720
vigorous

682
00:24:07,278 --> 00:24:10,400
female

683
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,440
on the sweet side

684
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,600
and

685
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:16,000
use those two and then

686
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:17,519
the other end of the spectrum that more

687
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,599
gassy

688
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:21,119
new york city like

689
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:24,079
diesely

690
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:25,678
red grapefruit look like a little more

691
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:28,158
sour

692
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:31,679
with the same stretch a short

693
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:33,360
indica stat with like a more stacked

694
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:35,278
internal spacing

695
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:37,359
and then something with

696
00:24:35,278 --> 00:24:40,159
a little bit more of a stretch

697
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:42,479
and a little bit different of a spacing

698
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:44,880
so i could keep everything open because

699
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,480
as far as further project you know at

700
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,480
that time i'm like i don't

701
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,440
want to just make this one thing

702
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,679
like

703
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:54,320
this is how i'm gonna really find it

704
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:56,000
when i find it i'm gonna know

705
00:24:54,319 --> 00:24:57,599
yeah i think that was a good approach

706
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,839
too because they all

707
00:24:57,599 --> 00:25:02,079
like they were all great in their own

708
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:04,798
right that's for certain

709
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:06,079
yeah and you know and i just

710
00:25:04,798 --> 00:25:08,480
i feel like

711
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:10,000
if i don't do if i didn't do that then

712
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,079
i'd be kind of

713
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:16,079
limiting myself and then other people

714
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:18,558
too oh absolutely and i want like i want

715
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:21,119
everyone to enjoy just the way

716
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:22,240
you know that these things caught my eye

717
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:24,239
i mean

718
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:26,480
and it's so funny the way it's trending

719
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:28,720
like the way cannabis trends

720
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:31,440
in the markets go like we've had these

721
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:33,278
for so long and smoking on it but then

722
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:35,360
everything went through with

723
00:25:33,278 --> 00:25:38,000
cookies and then all the other different

724
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:40,719
hybrids and don't get me wrong i love

725
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,880
all of it i appreciate every strain

726
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:45,120
there for what they are so i'm never

727
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:47,200
gonna bash on one style

728
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:48,879
of breeding and or

729
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:51,200
kind of cannabis

730
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,320
like they're all they all have their

731
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,519
purpose

732
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:56,480
i agree

733
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:59,119
i think the grapefruit and me starting

734
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,079
to open up into breeding

735
00:25:59,119 --> 00:26:02,000
and

736
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:05,199
i just felt like i should definitely

737
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:07,839
keep that going and keep it open because

738
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:10,480
it's kind of unique to

739
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:12,639
me and this other guy

740
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,919
he since i think he ended up selling all

741
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:16,320
his share

742
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:18,880
of his seeds from that season

743
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:20,639
and i wanted him for preservation i knew

744
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:23,120
what i wanted to do

745
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:25,038
and it was just like i don't ever want

746
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:27,278
this girl to go away

747
00:26:25,038 --> 00:26:29,278
because i mean how many strains have

748
00:26:27,278 --> 00:26:31,278
been lost because of not we know without

749
00:26:29,278 --> 00:26:32,720
hindsight yeah and that's one that's got

750
00:26:31,278 --> 00:26:34,798
to stick around i gotta say that's

751
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:36,798
probably still to this day one of my

752
00:26:34,798 --> 00:26:39,839
favorite smokes of all time

753
00:26:36,798 --> 00:26:42,480
yeah and i mean she's been around for a

754
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:45,199
long time and i think people kind of

755
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:47,278
like oh this is so good but then

756
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:49,679
you know some new things coming oh wow

757
00:26:47,278 --> 00:26:50,798
this is so good too and it's natural

758
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:53,038
instinct

759
00:26:50,798 --> 00:26:55,200
everyone's gonna i mean variety is

760
00:26:53,038 --> 00:26:57,359
awesome it's the spice of life

761
00:26:55,200 --> 00:27:00,400
but i also like something i can go back

762
00:26:57,359 --> 00:27:03,599
to that's reminiscing yes and it's just

763
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:05,679
a flavor can take you back to a memory

764
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:07,678
in a good time you know

765
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:09,759
so it wasn't just about the strain it

766
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:12,798
was about those memories

767
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:14,400
it was a collective thing i i feel

768
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:16,400
and i think i would have been doing an

769
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,440
injustice of not keeping it around so

770
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,960
that's why

771
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,480
when i chose someone when if i was

772
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:23,278
anybody was going to work with it with

773
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,720
me would be chris like that's my brother

774
00:27:23,278 --> 00:27:26,000
i love him

775
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,159
and

776
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:31,839
you know he loves that plant and i love

777
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:34,320
chris and i have the utmost admiration

778
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:36,558
for him because he he stays in his own

779
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:38,000
like he made his own way

780
00:27:36,558 --> 00:27:40,558
yeah absolutely

781
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,640
everything that he has is so unique to

782
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:44,240
him and he doesn't sway

783
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:46,480
and don't get me wrong he's worked with

784
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,599
some stuff that's familiar with other

785
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,599
people too

786
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:51,918
because it's smart and to be honest with

787
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:53,678
you those very vanilla cookies and all

788
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:57,840
this cookie strains that platinum

789
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:59,759
cookies is fire oh fire as [ __ ] it's so

790
00:27:57,839 --> 00:28:03,119
different than a lot of the other cookie

791
00:27:59,759 --> 00:28:05,839
hybrids that are out there so still even

792
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:08,000
then even doing cookie strains like you

793
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:11,918
know learning from chris on those modes

794
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,759
like he's stayed so individual and true

795
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:15,759
inconsistent

796
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:18,960
super consistent

797
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:21,679
taking so many pages out of his book

798
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:24,720
and just dinner after dinner and

799
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:26,798
event after event with him and just even

800
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,880
just phone calls just

801
00:28:26,798 --> 00:28:30,798
taking all of that

802
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:33,278
info end and just

803
00:28:30,798 --> 00:28:35,038
getting that vibe too you know just you

804
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:37,839
could talk forever

805
00:28:35,038 --> 00:28:39,599
so easy going so humble so open with

806
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:41,759
information too

807
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:43,759
but he's not scared to share whereas

808
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:45,519
like you know in the early years no one

809
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:47,200
wanted to tell anybody anything oh you

810
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:49,278
got to learn that yourself

811
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,159
and i think we've all gone through that

812
00:28:49,278 --> 00:28:52,398
if you're

813
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:54,320
within a certain age i mean if you're 40

814
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:55,519
years younger you've definitely felt

815
00:28:54,319 --> 00:28:56,398
that

816
00:28:55,519 --> 00:28:57,839
oh yeah

817
00:28:56,398 --> 00:28:59,519
for sure it's good to have somebody

818
00:28:57,839 --> 00:29:00,319
around like him that's you know willing

819
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:03,119
to

820
00:29:00,319 --> 00:29:05,439
willing to help out and he's always been

821
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:07,918
one of those people that he's over the

822
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:10,880
top he was one of the first people the

823
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:13,038
the first time i met him he put my kids

824
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,880
before anybody else he wanted to make

825
00:29:13,038 --> 00:29:16,558
sure that they had juice they had drinks

826
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,640
they were ready they were happy before

827
00:29:16,558 --> 00:29:20,079
we even started talking and it's like

828
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:22,159
god damn that

829
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:23,119
i mean it shows the character quality

830
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:26,640
you know

831
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:27,918
oh he's he's a genuine dude that's why i

832
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,759
love him man

833
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:32,640
he's such a good guy so i've taken so

834
00:29:29,759 --> 00:29:34,720
many things with when i think of those

835
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:37,440
kind of relationships and then

836
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:39,360
working with my own personal stuff

837
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:42,558
i keep all those things in mind and it's

838
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:44,719
like i can't let these guys down because

839
00:29:42,558 --> 00:29:46,879
they've never let me down

840
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,798
and i would be like kind of doing it

841
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:50,640
just justice if i did i think like

842
00:29:48,798 --> 00:29:52,720
that's how i feel like

843
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:55,278
i can't do that like

844
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:58,079
and he was super supportive even before

845
00:29:55,278 --> 00:29:59,839
i even decided doing anything

846
00:29:58,079 --> 00:30:01,359
after the collaborative work you know i

847
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:02,079
talked to him and i said hey chris i

848
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:04,079

849
00:30:02,079 --> 00:30:05,918
you know man i said now that i've done

850
00:30:04,079 --> 00:30:06,720
what i've had to do with the building

851
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:08,960
and

852
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:10,558
all the caregiving stuff is well on its

853
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,558
way and all that stuff's kind of

854
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:15,678
whatever you know i'm really thinking

855
00:30:12,558 --> 00:30:16,960
going back in on the true passion and

856
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:18,159
really doing some work with this

857
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,759
breeding and

858
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:22,080
i just want you to know that i'm gonna

859
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:23,519
definitely start going back in on these

860
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:25,839
grapefruits

861
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:27,200
and but i want to ask you and say

862
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:28,720
something to you because i know that

863
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,840
we've done some collaborative work and

864
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,600
you've already

865
00:30:29,839 --> 00:30:33,759
released some things

866
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:35,759
and he was so good about he's like are

867
00:30:33,759 --> 00:30:38,879
you kidding me why you do whatever you

868
00:30:35,759 --> 00:30:41,359
want like you gave me these like yeah

869
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:43,679
and that's just the person he is but

870
00:30:41,359 --> 00:30:46,079
me being the person i am i have to be

871
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:47,919
transparent i'm gonna ask right and if

872
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:49,678
he felt away like i said maybe we'll

873
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:51,679
just keep working on them

874
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:52,880
maybe we do some more collaborative work

875
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:55,038
with it or

876
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:56,559
maybe i had a different ver you know

877
00:30:55,038 --> 00:30:59,038
vision for it

878
00:30:56,558 --> 00:31:00,398
and no that was not the case

879
00:30:59,038 --> 00:31:02,480
not at all

880
00:31:00,398 --> 00:31:05,918
which made me even want to push even

881
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:09,440
harder with it good i'm glad you did

882

around and the photos are coming out

894
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:36,480
people are actually getting to enjoy

895
00:31:33,839 --> 00:31:39,119
some of the extracts and the flower at

896
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:41,278
their local dispen you know stores or

897
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:43,439
person and then obviously their own

898
00:31:41,278 --> 00:31:46,880
personal experiences either growing in

899
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:48,880
their garden inside or outside it's kind

900
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:52,240
of just built itself and now that it's

901
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:54,240
going it i don't even know man i i still

902
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,759
i'm like man we just had this and we

903
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:58,399
were enjoying it

904
00:31:55,759 --> 00:32:00,879
and no one really knew about it like we

905
00:31:58,398 --> 00:32:02,959
all knew it was like true cannabis

906
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:04,880
enthusiasts and

907
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:06,319
that grapefruit was around but to have

908
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,679
like a strain and then work on it

909
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:10,319
locally

910
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:12,320
and then just like people locally like

911
00:32:10,319 --> 00:32:14,798
you know that's it it's okay like and

912
00:32:12,319 --> 00:32:16,798
then some people really enjoying it

913
00:32:14,798 --> 00:32:17,918
but we really just loved it and it

914
00:32:16,798 --> 00:32:21,038
wasn't just

915
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:22,399
and to be honest with you the f2s

916
00:32:21,038 --> 00:32:24,079
super terpy

917
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:26,558
huge blobs

918
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:28,480
assurance the time on anything

919
00:32:26,558 --> 00:32:30,319
that's figure like a

920
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,399
you can't believe

921
00:32:30,319 --> 00:32:34,079
you shorten the time on it

922
00:32:32,398 --> 00:32:36,398
oh it's short the time like anything

923
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:38,639
that that grapefruit touches shortens

924
00:32:36,398 --> 00:32:40,319
the time they were already short when i

925
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:43,440
grew

926
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:45,599
so which ones did you have again

927
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:47,759
the relic grapefruit really great for it

928
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:49,519
the inbred line was a little bit longer

929
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:51,440
but the sweet pink i mean that that

930
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:53,759
stuck out like a sore thumb you know

931
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:57,360
that thing was just stacked up bushy

932
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:59,278
[ __ ] yielded like a mother

933
00:32:57,359 --> 00:33:03,038
so i think when chris was doing that

934
00:32:59,278 --> 00:33:05,679
relic i think because chris loves sativa

935
00:33:03,038 --> 00:33:08,079
yeah it's his true passion and to be

936
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:09,600
honest with you i love sativa too

937
00:33:08,079 --> 00:33:10,558
i'm the same

938
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:12,158
and

939
00:33:10,558 --> 00:33:14,398
i think

940
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:17,840
that gassier one

941
00:33:14,398 --> 00:33:22,158
of what i've seen out of populations

942
00:33:17,839 --> 00:33:24,079
the gasier more acrid sour citrus

943
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:26,640
phenols are a little more stretchier

944
00:33:24,079 --> 00:33:28,558
with a little more spacing

945
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:30,399
a little more

946
00:33:28,558 --> 00:33:32,720
still having nice stacks though

947
00:33:30,398 --> 00:33:35,518
beautiful stacked flowers but definitely

948
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,720
more stretching and i think that has to

949
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:38,798
do with just

950
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:40,798
that particular

951
00:33:38,798 --> 00:33:42,398
version of the plant that you're looking

952
00:33:40,798 --> 00:33:43,839
for that's what he likes so i believe

953
00:33:42,398 --> 00:33:45,599
when he read it

954
00:33:43,839 --> 00:33:46,558
you know certain characteristics just

955
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:49,359
remain

956
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:51,200
more dominant yes like i've done some

957
00:33:49,359 --> 00:33:53,359
like my buddies have had even out here

958
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,080
there's been a lot of god what is the

959
00:33:53,359 --> 00:33:55,759
fat

960
00:33:54,079 --> 00:33:57,759
the hell is the name of that

961
00:33:55,759 --> 00:33:59,599
male my buddy used

962
00:33:57,759 --> 00:34:01,119
oh it's like it was a

963
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:02,319
kimbo kush

964
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:04,398
okay

965
00:34:02,319 --> 00:34:05,359
and this kimbo kush no matter what it

966
00:34:04,398 --> 00:34:08,159
touched

967
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:11,519
just was so that kimbo kush male was so

968
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:12,559
dominant that's all you would 95 of the

969
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:13,918
time that's all you was getting this

970
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:17,119
gimbal bush

971
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:18,480
whereas on these grapefruits

972
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:20,639
you're gonna pretty much see i mean

973
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:22,320
you'll even you can get some different

974
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:23,838
turf but pretty much for the most part

975
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:26,800
that is citrus

976
00:34:23,838 --> 00:34:28,878
it is sweet pink grapefruit oh for sure

977
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:30,960
orange peel

978
00:34:28,878 --> 00:34:33,440
and then that salary a little more

979
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,480
fuelly gassy like that soma

980
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:37,358
i definitely

981
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:39,599
found exactly what you were saying my

982
00:34:37,358 --> 00:34:41,440
inbred line phenos they had huge inner

983
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:43,519
nodes we're talking like two three

984
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,800
inches but they have these rock hard

985
00:34:43,519 --> 00:34:46,559
buds on them

986
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,560
now here's a funny story for you i'd

987
00:34:46,559 --> 00:34:50,799
already been growing for quite a few

988
00:34:48,559 --> 00:34:52,639
years by this point i already knew how

989
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:55,200
to take clones and everything but that

990
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:58,000
was the one that really told me take a

991
00:34:55,199 --> 00:35:00,239
clone of everything because

992
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,079
the sweet pink was then obvious like i'm

993
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:03,679
taking a i'm taking a cut of this we're

994
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:05,440
going to test it out we're going to try

995
00:35:03,679 --> 00:35:07,440
it out some more and you know see how it

996
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:09,760
reacts in different environments the

997
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:11,679
inbred line i wasn't as interested in

998
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:13,599
because those long inner noses like oh

999
00:35:11,679 --> 00:35:16,239
god this is just a mess of a plant you

1000
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:18,000
know but it smelled so [ __ ] beautiful

1001
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:20,399
i was interested and it wasn't until

1002
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,800
after i cut it down that i was like oh

1003
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:25,599
my god this it's it's that

1004
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:28,000
citrus sour that and not just citrus

1005
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:31,039
sour not like a lemon sour it's got that

1006
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:33,440
grapefruit [ __ ] beautiful sour you

1007
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:35,519
know that's so i guess

1008
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:37,760
that's the other thing so like when i

1009
00:35:35,519 --> 00:35:39,519
say hash and terpenes

1010
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,280
and i kind of get this from like me and

1011
00:35:39,519 --> 00:35:44,880
chris share this

1012
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:47,839
i'm a terrapore i love flavor i love

1013
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:49,838
food i love just the smell things i love

1014
00:35:47,838 --> 00:35:53,519
to taste the different things

1015
00:35:49,838 --> 00:35:54,559
and just like with uh unique meals

1016
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:56,320
and

1017
00:35:54,559 --> 00:35:58,000
you know they pair well with a bunch of

1018
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,200
different ingredients that just

1019
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,639
sometimes you look at them and you're

1020
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:02,480
like what the [ __ ]

1021
00:36:00,639 --> 00:36:05,838
there's no way that's going to taste but

1022
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:07,679
when you layer those flavors they do oh

1023
00:36:05,838 --> 00:36:09,599
yeah for sure so i guess my point when

1024
00:36:07,679 --> 00:36:11,358
i'm going with this is like on that

1025
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:12,800
mountain wizard just to

1026
00:36:11,358 --> 00:36:14,000
say one

1027
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:16,160
my hope

1028
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,199
with the skittles and then that mountain

1029
00:36:16,159 --> 00:36:20,078
crop

1030
00:36:17,199 --> 00:36:22,480
was just getting layered flavors

1031
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:24,800
like you're tasting one thing on the way

1032
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:26,719
out and when you on the way in and then

1033
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,079
when you blow out it's like what the

1034
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:30,399
[ __ ]

1035
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:32,079
dude that's so different like it's two

1036
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:34,559
different sides

1037
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:36,240
oh yeah going like bob ross on his

1038
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:38,719
painting and saying happy little

1039
00:36:36,239 --> 00:36:40,959
accidents well there's that happy little

1040
00:36:38,719 --> 00:36:43,199
accident i guess that was a damn good

1041
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:45,039
accident

1042
00:36:43,199 --> 00:36:46,639
you know and i said well all i got to

1043
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:50,159
say man is

1044
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:52,799
it was amazing genetics i paired them it

1045
00:36:50,159 --> 00:36:54,319
just worked out dude and with

1046
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:56,000
definitely with some effort and i'm not

1047
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:58,720
going to say that it wasn't

1048
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,880
but who knew that that layering

1049
00:36:58,719 --> 00:37:03,279
that was my wish and what i was going

1050
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:04,559
for as far as the therapy profile

1051
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:06,320
and it just

1052
00:37:04,559 --> 00:37:08,799
hit it on the head

1053
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:10,000
and it was just one of those like yeah

1054
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:12,560
you know you take your fist and you

1055
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,239
bring your elbow down like yeah i did it

1056
00:37:12,559 --> 00:37:16,799
like

1057
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:19,358
it was you know and i'm usually not that

1058
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:23,160
guy i'm like super like i'm just not but

1059
00:37:19,358 --> 00:37:23,159
man that was like yes

1060
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:29,119
so we you know we rolled one up

1061
00:37:27,199 --> 00:37:30,879
obviously and

1062
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:33,119
he took the first couple hits he's like

1063
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:34,960
what the [ __ ] it this is like sweet

1064
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:36,800
candy orange

1065
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:40,000
it goes but when i blow it out it's like

1066
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:41,680
a whole bag of skittles and

1067
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,000
i didn't get it

1068
00:37:41,679 --> 00:37:45,679
but it could but it coats it

1069
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,079
honestly one of my favorite ones that i

1070
00:37:45,679 --> 00:37:51,039
found out that madden wizard came out

1071
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:53,119
it had such an interesting profile

1072
00:37:51,039 --> 00:37:54,400
a lot of them were happy heavy in that

1073
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:58,800
orange

1074
00:37:54,400 --> 00:38:02,480
but i got one that had like a floral

1075
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:05,599
soapy fresh mintiness to it it was

1076
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:06,880
amazing and that one that one [ __ ] you

1077
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:10,000
up

1078
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:11,838
i believe in it i believe it so see

1079
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,679
there's where those

1080
00:38:11,838 --> 00:38:16,239
that's the other thing that's super nice

1081
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:18,319
about regular beans and with some of

1082
00:38:16,239 --> 00:38:19,439
these things the way they pair together

1083
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:21,119
but

1084
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:24,960
all of a sudden you're like oh where did

1085
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:26,720
this off you come because like 80 85 of

1086
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:28,720
the time you're gonna get like

1087
00:38:26,719 --> 00:38:31,759
one of the skittles all of the skittles

1088
00:38:28,719 --> 00:38:33,279
the orange the combination like

1089
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:35,920
depending on the color you'll get very

1090
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:40,079
different variations of color

1091
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:42,400
maybe a little bit on calyx production

1092
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:43,920
box failing and or like heart like some

1093
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:46,160
are a little bit hotter

1094
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:48,320
some are a little bit you know because

1095
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:50,399
of that mountain drop like minecraft's

1096
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:52,400
not a super hard blood but it's open and

1097
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:54,880
it's a great hash maker

1098
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:57,358
and the terps are just off the chives

1099
00:38:54,880 --> 00:39:00,079
yes whereas the z whiz was a really

1100
00:38:57,358 --> 00:39:03,519
stacked bud that was a lot more denser

1101
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:05,519
with even more resin population

1102
00:39:03,519 --> 00:39:08,559
and then this super unique terpene

1103
00:39:05,519 --> 00:39:10,800
profile off the male just on the stem

1104
00:39:08,559 --> 00:39:13,279
and then made i have f2s in that as well

1105
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:16,720
i did a limited release of those

1106
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:19,359
and i still have i had eighth

1107
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:21,679
oh god i had three of the females

1108
00:39:19,358 --> 00:39:24,078
and i you know kept those expressions

1109
00:39:21,679 --> 00:39:25,679
open too for further work

1110
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:27,359
just to kind of keep aside and then i

1111
00:39:25,679 --> 00:39:28,719
wanted to put a few into some people's

1112
00:39:27,358 --> 00:39:30,799
hands and see

1113
00:39:28,719 --> 00:39:31,919
what they were finding before i go any

1114
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,119
further

1115
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:35,039
nice man

1116
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:37,838
what's your idea behind pairing some of

1117
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:39,358
these up you said you work with some of

1118
00:39:37,838 --> 00:39:41,039
the older stuff you don't mind working

1119
00:39:39,358 --> 00:39:42,400
with the newer stuff you're no shy to

1120
00:39:41,039 --> 00:39:44,159
that obvious

1121
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:46,240
but what is it that like when you're

1122
00:39:44,159 --> 00:39:47,039
going after something where do you go

1123
00:39:46,239 --> 00:39:48,719
well

1124
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:50,880
i think that's going to pair good with

1125
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:53,279
this okay so

1126
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:54,720
oh so let's say you know every you get a

1127
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:56,720
clone or you

1128
00:39:54,719 --> 00:39:58,639
you smoke some flour wow this is really

1129
00:39:56,719 --> 00:40:00,480
amazing and i've been seeing it out

1130
00:39:58,639 --> 00:40:02,319
there people growing it

1131
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,599
you get it you grow it

1132
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,800
and

1133
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:06,318
i don't know it's just something that

1134
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:09,280
held tight to me it's just like caught

1135
00:40:06,318 --> 00:40:11,279
my eye like man she's really nice

1136
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:13,519
and i think it would pair well

1137
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:15,920
what i'm trying to do and i think

1138
00:40:13,519 --> 00:40:17,759
i consider myself a pretty

1139
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:20,000
good judge

1140
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:22,240
of what people like

1141
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,318
i'm pretty picky and i

1142
00:40:22,239 --> 00:40:26,639
i know what i like it and everyone else

1143
00:40:24,318 --> 00:40:28,639
enjoys it so i'm like man if i i put

1144
00:40:26,639 --> 00:40:30,239
these two flames together

1145
00:40:28,639 --> 00:40:31,920
even though some of it's already been

1146
00:40:30,239 --> 00:40:33,919
done and there's you know there's a

1147
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:35,599
bunch of tropicana cookies out there and

1148
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,960
crosses but

1149
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:39,599
not this

1150
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:41,838
and then that's okay

1151
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:43,200
i just liked them i enjoyed these and i

1152
00:40:41,838 --> 00:40:45,679
was like well let me while i'm playing

1153
00:40:43,199 --> 00:40:47,919
around let me make my own version

1154
00:40:45,679 --> 00:40:49,519
and i guess some of it was as a

1155
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:51,200
caregiver

1156
00:40:49,519 --> 00:40:54,159
in the state that's

1157
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:55,919
recreational as well and having so many

1158
00:40:54,159 --> 00:40:58,159
different stores and all these different

1159
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,760
things coming up with so many other

1160
00:40:58,159 --> 00:41:02,480
caregivers growing

1161
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:04,960
i wanted to have my own genetics

1162
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:06,960
that were familiar so if someone oh

1163
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:08,400
that's dropped stuff i smoked that but

1164
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,280
not this one

1165
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:11,280
because

1166
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:12,079
i'm the only one who has it

1167
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,519
and

1168
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:15,440
i guess that was

1169
00:41:13,519 --> 00:41:17,920
some of the reasoning too just having my

1170
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:19,440
own unique genetics so like when people

1171
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:21,200
are looking for a certain thing like oh

1172
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:23,200
i want that one i like this but this

1173
00:41:21,199 --> 00:41:25,838
one's man i just like this one better

1174
00:41:23,199 --> 00:41:27,919
just it tastes a little bit better

1175
00:41:25,838 --> 00:41:30,239
when i grow it it's just

1176
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:31,280
more of what i'm looking for compared to

1177
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:33,519
this one

1178
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:35,760
basically trying to improve

1179
00:41:33,519 --> 00:41:38,239
things that i liked but you know even if

1180
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:41,040
a great pie let's say for instance

1181
00:41:38,239 --> 00:41:43,759
grape pie is an amazing plant

1182
00:41:41,039 --> 00:41:46,559
and super tasty let's be honest it grows

1183
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:48,000
like [ __ ] and that's super small but

1184
00:41:46,559 --> 00:41:50,799
that's how is what i was going to say

1185
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:53,199
about the trap you know so like all of

1186
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:56,318
them really just not a producer so like

1187
00:41:53,199 --> 00:41:58,239
i'm trying to make it so it's similar

1188
00:41:56,318 --> 00:42:00,400
but it's a better producer

1189
00:41:58,239 --> 00:42:03,118
yeah add to it add a little more figure

1190
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:04,318
to it add more structure to it some

1191
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:05,760
strength

1192
00:42:04,318 --> 00:42:08,079
blood size

1193
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:09,440
more hash population

1194
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:11,359
just always

1195
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:13,599
trying to improve on it not taking

1196
00:42:11,358 --> 00:42:16,480
really away from it but definitely add

1197
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:19,039
and influence it positively you're

1198
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:21,280
finding cultivars that you really like

1199
00:42:19,039 --> 00:42:22,800
and you're making them better you're mad

1200
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,519
yeah just trying to make it

1201
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,119
like

1202
00:42:23,519 --> 00:42:27,039
seeing the flaws

1203
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:27,760
and pairing the mail with it that i

1204
00:42:27,039 --> 00:42:31,119
think

1205
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:31,839
at least the males that i have my stable

1206
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:34,400
and

1207
00:42:31,838 --> 00:42:36,639
using them to their benefit not just

1208
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:38,240
making it just to make it and don't get

1209
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:39,920
me wrong some of them in there were just

1210
00:42:38,239 --> 00:42:41,519
really nice emails and

1211
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:43,599
some of it i probably will never release

1212
00:42:41,519 --> 00:42:45,358
but some of it i've added in

1213
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:47,359
to it just to say just have a different

1214
00:42:45,358 --> 00:42:48,400
off you like man this cheese is really

1215
00:42:47,358 --> 00:42:51,358
good

1216
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:53,680
but these kind of girls like [ __ ] too

1217
00:42:51,358 --> 00:42:56,400
so like it's all small buns but the

1218
00:42:53,679 --> 00:42:58,480
[ __ ] weed's amazing it's got this

1219
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:00,960
really great high

1220
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:03,039
it's reminiscent of good times that i've

1221
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:05,358
had my friends in the past

1222
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:06,318
pain in the ass and pickle some of them

1223
00:43:05,358 --> 00:43:08,400
are like

1224
00:43:06,318 --> 00:43:10,318
picky on feed

1225
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:11,599
some of them are super stretchy some of

1226
00:43:10,318 --> 00:43:14,079
them just aren't stretching at all you

1227
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:16,160
can veg them forever so i guess like

1228
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:20,000
when i did some skittles work like

1229
00:43:16,159 --> 00:43:23,118
skittles is an amazing cultivator ugly

1230
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:25,199
flower super tasty flower though

1231
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:27,680
if you get you smoke the real skittles

1232
00:43:25,199 --> 00:43:29,279
you know as well as i do as good as from

1233
00:43:27,679 --> 00:43:30,480
the first hit all the way down to the

1234
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:32,240
last

1235
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:36,000
because she doesn't really grow super

1236
00:43:32,239 --> 00:43:37,598
well so she takes so long on veg

1237
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,199
so some guys like oh you know it's a

1238
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:41,519
nine week strain it is a nine week

1239
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:44,000
stream but if i didn't add

1240
00:43:41,519 --> 00:43:46,079
this to it it would have been longer

1241
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,159
yeah you know like

1242
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:50,240
always trying to make it better

1243
00:43:48,159 --> 00:43:52,879
sometimes the female's only bringing

1244
00:43:50,239 --> 00:43:55,199
color and hash production other than

1245
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:57,358
that she's not bringing anything else

1246
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:59,519
maybe her name because people are known

1247
00:43:57,358 --> 00:44:01,279
for her and i'm always going to keep it

1248
00:43:59,519 --> 00:44:03,519
transparent i'm going to say yes i use

1249
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:05,599
this this is what it is and some people

1250
00:44:03,519 --> 00:44:08,480
are like oh man i drew that green pie

1251
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:10,240
[ __ ] it didn't give me well it's like

1252
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:11,760
this one this is why we

1253
00:44:10,239 --> 00:44:13,358
cross these things

1254
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:16,319
and try to make them better because it

1255
00:44:13,358 --> 00:44:18,559
really does have some amazing quality

1256
00:44:16,318 --> 00:44:21,759
that's good to hear i've never did get

1257
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:23,679
to get to grow that great pie but i was

1258
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:25,680
going to say that about that trop you

1259
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:27,679
know you definitely improved on that

1260
00:44:25,679 --> 00:44:30,239
i've always loved the taste of the

1261
00:44:27,679 --> 00:44:32,799
chopped cookies but every every time

1262
00:44:30,239 --> 00:44:35,039
i've grown it or had a phenotype and an

1263
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:37,760
outcrossing of it that leans heavy

1264
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:40,960
towards the trop side it's got beautiful

1265
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:43,599
beautiful flowers it smells amazing it

1266
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:45,119
tastes great the potencies and and the

1267
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:47,920
yield [ __ ]

1268
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:48,880
yep yield [ __ ] it's kind of wispy a

1269
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:51,200
little

1270
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:54,240
they're not very dense buds they're not

1271
00:44:51,199 --> 00:44:56,078
rocks by any means and small just really

1272
00:44:54,239 --> 00:44:58,000
small bloodstains

1273
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:59,920
yeah and i definitely did not have that

1274
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,318
problem with the mountain wizard at all

1275
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:04,800
i was getting phenotypes that expressed

1276
00:45:02,318 --> 00:45:06,400
that flavor but with the skittles yield

1277
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:09,119
the beautiful

1278
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:10,639
bag appeal the buds i i love the bud

1279
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:12,480
flower shape on it

1280
00:45:10,639 --> 00:45:14,159
honestly yeah

1281
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:16,800
that's kind of you know and really

1282
00:45:14,159 --> 00:45:18,559
trying to influence that butt structure

1283
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:20,560
make it so it's a little bit easier to

1284
00:45:18,559 --> 00:45:22,480
trim like so when i say like in a

1285
00:45:20,559 --> 00:45:24,078
positive way like i want guys to not

1286
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:26,240
only get the yield

1287
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:27,839
but it's better trimming

1288
00:45:26,239 --> 00:45:30,078
so like if it's better trimming that's

1289
00:45:27,838 --> 00:45:31,920
more production it's more productive

1290
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:33,760
means that you can spend less time doing

1291
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:35,358
that kind of work and more time where

1292
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:36,960
you need to be

1293
00:45:35,358 --> 00:45:38,799
so you would say that's one of your

1294
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:40,318
goals as well as that brack to leaf

1295
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:42,720
ratio

1296
00:45:40,318 --> 00:45:44,239
yeah i want that i i definitely are

1297
00:45:42,719 --> 00:45:45,679
always thinking

1298
00:45:44,239 --> 00:45:47,919
thinking about the grower and the

1299
00:45:45,679 --> 00:45:49,838
caregiver and just even down to the

1300
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:51,440
patient making it

1301
00:45:49,838 --> 00:45:53,440
streamlining

1302
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:55,358
every part of that

1303
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:56,720
whole process

1304
00:45:55,358 --> 00:45:58,639
hell yeah but giving them something

1305
00:45:56,719 --> 00:46:00,480
that's like oh well it's familiar damn

1306
00:45:58,639 --> 00:46:02,318
man this is pretty damn close to what i

1307
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:04,639
was seeing but i get look how much

1308
00:46:02,318 --> 00:46:06,318
better it is like and i think a lot of

1309
00:46:04,639 --> 00:46:08,318
guys want to do that

1310
00:46:06,318 --> 00:46:10,079
that's my main goal though always trying

1311
00:46:08,318 --> 00:46:11,838
to make it better that's why i like that

1312
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:14,960
grapefruit is amazing anything it

1313
00:46:11,838 --> 00:46:16,719
touches it just turns it to go the mail

1314
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:18,159
me and chris was sending back he was you

1315
00:46:16,719 --> 00:46:20,559
know telling me i was like oh man this

1316
00:46:18,159 --> 00:46:22,879
f2 male is like i can't let it go

1317
00:46:20,559 --> 00:46:24,639
it's just so nice you know and

1318
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:26,800
i'm like well did it grow like this and

1319
00:46:24,639 --> 00:46:28,480
this and this because i remember from

1320
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:30,240
projects in the past

1321
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:32,880
this is kind of what i was looking for

1322
00:46:30,239 --> 00:46:35,279
and then sending me pictures and

1323
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:37,920
so when i went into my population going

1324
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:39,760
back in to do some further work with it

1325
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,800
that's kind of what i was looking for as

1326
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:43,440
well

1327
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:44,640
super fast in fact that male out of all

1328
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:46,079
of them

1329
00:46:44,639 --> 00:46:48,078
my god

1330
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:48,800
it would eat anything you could throw to

1331
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:50,640
it

1332
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:52,880
not picky at all

1333
00:46:50,639 --> 00:46:55,440
it's not that it's a super heavy feeder

1334
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:58,880
it's just not picky yeah you could have

1335
00:46:55,440 --> 00:47:01,920
really had a hard time as far as like

1336
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:04,000
the nutrient regimen with it did you no

1337
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:05,838
not at all so that's another thing all

1338
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,760
the way down to that and i don't get me

1339
00:47:05,838 --> 00:47:09,199
wrong some of these just like some of

1340
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:11,839
the chems and the older strands like

1341
00:47:09,199 --> 00:47:13,039
some of them are just like i want food

1342
00:47:11,838 --> 00:47:13,920
like you need

1343
00:47:13,039 --> 00:47:15,759
me

1344
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:18,000
but at the end of the day

1345
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:21,119
especially with cost just rising

1346
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:22,239
electric bills just rising soil

1347
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:24,480
and

1348
00:47:22,239 --> 00:47:25,519
nutrients and just all of those things

1349
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:28,159
that was

1350
00:47:25,519 --> 00:47:30,239
i was always trying to shave cost myself

1351
00:47:28,159 --> 00:47:32,159
in a smart way

1352
00:47:30,239 --> 00:47:33,679
i mean that's part of business

1353
00:47:32,159 --> 00:47:36,159
so if i can

1354
00:47:33,679 --> 00:47:39,759
shave off either some bench time because

1355
00:47:36,159 --> 00:47:41,838
i added bigger but yet still kept

1356
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:43,520
the same quality that i was looking for

1357
00:47:41,838 --> 00:47:46,318
and the end result

1358
00:47:43,519 --> 00:47:48,639
there's my influencer always looking to

1359
00:47:46,318 --> 00:47:51,039
definitely make a positive

1360
00:47:48,639 --> 00:47:54,000
influence so that way it's just a better

1361
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:55,838
product easier to work with

1362
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:58,159
um yet simpler

1363
00:47:55,838 --> 00:48:00,078
in the entire time you're putting you

1364
00:47:58,159 --> 00:48:02,399
know like you said the caregiver and the

1365
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:04,240

1369

1370

you made

1461
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:23,679
what has popped out where how many

1462
00:51:21,679 --> 00:51:25,199
different strains now quite a few

1463
00:51:23,679 --> 00:51:27,440
you have a lot on your website that's

1464
00:51:25,199 --> 00:51:29,199
for sure oh there's so many

1465
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:29,920
but out of all of them which one stuck

1466
00:51:29,199 --> 00:51:31,519
out

1467
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:34,079
so the

1468
00:51:31,519 --> 00:51:37,039
oh god the god of the pancakes

1469
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:38,960
how do the pancakes work uh stuffed

1470
00:51:37,039 --> 00:51:40,880
strawberry crepes

1471
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:43,280
that the pancake the london pound cake

1472
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:44,400
on christmas eleven times the strawberry

1473
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:45,839
cough from

1474
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:49,599
cal cushman

1475
00:51:45,838 --> 00:51:53,440
just an amazing plant all the way around

1476
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:54,800
inside outside works really well up here

1477
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:56,559
to be honest

1478
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:58,480
the strawberry cough

1479
00:51:56,559 --> 00:52:00,400
you know another one of those that was a

1480
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:03,599
really tough

1481
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:06,160
super long vegging plant and just no

1482
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:08,079
stretch whatsoever just like nothing

1483
00:52:06,159 --> 00:52:10,159
yeah

1484
00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:12,720
but yeah and

1485
00:52:10,159 --> 00:52:15,199
just took forever just ever just keep

1486
00:52:12,719 --> 00:52:17,199
going super coughed on it

1487
00:52:15,199 --> 00:52:19,439
which i don't mind as long as i'm

1488
00:52:17,199 --> 00:52:22,078
actually at the end of it

1489
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:23,838
it's worth that time enough one way or

1490
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:25,440
another right right it was no don't get

1491
00:52:23,838 --> 00:52:27,519
me wrong it was always worth it one way

1492
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:30,318
or another especially for the tariffs

1493
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:31,679
she wasn't always the prettiest looking

1494
00:52:30,318 --> 00:52:32,800
flower

1495
00:52:31,679 --> 00:52:35,838
so

1496
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:37,440
the pancakes added a little bit kind of

1497
00:52:35,838 --> 00:52:40,000
like a makeover

1498
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:42,240
as far as visual appearance

1499
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,920
a tighter nugget structure easier to

1500
00:52:42,239 --> 00:52:47,679
trim

1501
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:50,159
uh better caleb's the leaf ratio

1502
00:52:47,679 --> 00:52:51,199
shortened the flour time

1503
00:52:50,159 --> 00:52:52,558
added

1504
00:52:51,199 --> 00:52:54,078
a different

1505
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:56,079
high to it

1506
00:52:54,079 --> 00:52:58,720
definitely a different

1507
00:52:56,079 --> 00:53:01,280
depth to the flavors

1508
00:52:58,719 --> 00:53:03,199
um what was nice is that

1509
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:04,640
on that particular strain everything

1510
00:53:03,199 --> 00:53:06,558
that we found

1511
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:07,920
and everything that everyone else is

1512
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:09,440
finding

1513
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:11,440
is that it

1514
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:13,280
i was so grateful that the male didn't

1515
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:14,800
take away from that strawberry cloth

1516
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:16,400
like when you hear strawberry you're

1517
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:18,400
looking for that

1518
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:19,838
berries at least you know that kind of

1519
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:20,800
red berry

1520
00:53:19,838 --> 00:53:23,279
and

1521
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:26,160
it's just tried and true

1522
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:28,559
the best part of it was that it added it

1523
00:53:26,159 --> 00:53:30,639
took away the bench time

1524
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:32,720
gave it a better spacing while keeping

1525
00:53:30,639 --> 00:53:34,400
the buns the buds

1526
00:53:32,719 --> 00:53:35,759
good size

1527
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:37,838
and

1528
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:38,880
overall weight you're getting a yield

1529
00:53:37,838 --> 00:53:40,799
now

1530
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:42,720
better hash production

1531
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:45,119
better bag appeal

1532
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:47,039
a better overall i think

1533
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:48,079
feeling than effects from it

1534
00:53:47,039 --> 00:53:49,279
didn't just

1535
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:50,240
limit it

1536
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:51,119
to

1537
00:53:50,239 --> 00:53:52,399
that

1538
00:53:51,119 --> 00:53:54,559
sativa

1539
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:56,400
as it is a sativa dominant hybrid but

1540
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:57,680
you will find

1541
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:59,280
certain uh

1542
00:53:57,679 --> 00:54:01,358
phenos of that

1543
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:03,680
will lean a little more towards you know

1544
00:54:01,358 --> 00:54:06,159
the strawberry end of it but that was

1545
00:54:03,679 --> 00:54:07,598
really one of my favorites out of that

1546
00:54:06,159 --> 00:54:09,759
super nice

1547
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:11,760
the other one that i really like out of

1548
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:12,960
those were

1549
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:15,440
the

1550
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:17,599
boot camp breakfast as well

1551
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:19,519
super nice they paid they just linked

1552
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:21,519
together just amazing

1553
00:54:19,519 --> 00:54:23,199
the colors from both ends that was the

1554
00:54:21,519 --> 00:54:26,159
other thing that what was the cross on

1555
00:54:23,199 --> 00:54:28,799
that one so that is the the london pound

1556
00:54:26,159 --> 00:54:30,078
cakes on food mints the pancakes male

1557
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:33,039
times

1558
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:36,240
military chocolate which i phenotyped

1559
00:54:33,039 --> 00:54:40,159
from seeds i got from only see go

1560
00:54:36,239 --> 00:54:42,639
okay i found a really nice pheno of it

1561
00:54:40,159 --> 00:54:45,039
that would out of all of them that just

1562
00:54:42,639 --> 00:54:46,480
stood out out of all of it

1563
00:54:45,039 --> 00:54:48,719
super

1564
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:49,440
chocolaty earthy

1565
00:54:48,719 --> 00:54:52,959
just

1566
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:55,119
the most resinous out of all of them

1567
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:58,240
nice blood structure

1568
00:54:55,119 --> 00:54:59,440
not super huge buds but they were rocks

1569
00:54:58,239 --> 00:55:02,399
and

1570
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:03,519
res is cut of bubba times the tropicana

1571
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:05,599
f2

1572
00:55:03,519 --> 00:55:07,358
oh okay so that that's what makes up the

1573
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:08,400
military chocolate

1574
00:55:07,358 --> 00:55:11,598
and

1575
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:13,680
so the cookies added that hardness to it

1576
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:16,318
obviously the

1577
00:55:13,679 --> 00:55:17,519
resin to the bubbler i like the bubbler

1578
00:55:16,318 --> 00:55:19,279
for the

1579
00:55:17,519 --> 00:55:21,679
medicinal value

1580
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:23,119
obviously the bud size you know nice

1581
00:55:21,679 --> 00:55:24,639
girth to it

1582
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:26,079
and then the colors

1583
00:55:24,639 --> 00:55:27,279
you know that's the other thing that i

1584
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:29,119
failed to

1585
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:30,960
mention with the

1586
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:33,200
stuffed strawberry crepes

1587
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:35,599
is the you know you'll get colors coming

1588
00:55:33,199 --> 00:55:38,078
out of all of that

1589
00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:40,079
pancakes mail definitely some beautiful

1590
00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:41,839
colors coming out of those

1591
00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:42,880
so that's another thing to look forward

1592
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:45,440
to that

1593
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:47,920
anything from purple to reds

1594
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:49,119
so then you add that to strawberry and

1595
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:51,760
it's just

1596
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:54,880
instant bag appeal and visual

1597
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:56,000
there's so many terpenes man just really

1598
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:58,000
nice

1599
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:00,639
good deal man good deal

1600
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:03,440
i know two of the ones that really

1601
00:56:00,639 --> 00:56:05,039
caught my eye that i picked actually

1602
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:06,720
actually there's one that we can't even

1603
00:56:05,039 --> 00:56:08,639
ignore now that we've talked about the

1604
00:56:06,719 --> 00:56:10,078
grapefruit for so long is that new one

1605
00:56:08,639 --> 00:56:11,759
that i grabbed from you the strawberry

1606
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:13,200
grapefruit bananas

1607
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:15,359
tell me you've gone through that i want

1608
00:56:13,199 --> 00:56:18,719
to know more about this i'm excited

1609
00:56:15,358 --> 00:56:20,880
about it so the 14 are cut is an amazing

1610
00:56:18,719 --> 00:56:21,838
hash cultivator

1611
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:23,920
and

1612
00:56:21,838 --> 00:56:27,599
amazing terpenes

1613
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:29,119
she's always not the best as far as like

1614
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:31,519
flower yield

1615
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:33,440
so then my hopes with the grapefruit was

1616
00:56:31,519 --> 00:56:36,000
to just add the girth

1617
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:37,760
go fish and shorten the timeline while

1618
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:40,719
keeping the hash there

1619
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:43,280
add another layer of flavor

1620
00:56:40,719 --> 00:56:45,679
super nice like i mean strawberries

1621
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:48,160
bananas grapefruits like it's just

1622
00:56:45,679 --> 00:56:50,000
fruity super terpy

1623
00:56:48,159 --> 00:56:51,440
i feel like there's so much gas out

1624
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:53,358
there that fruit

1625
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:54,559
that is a hash producer but with a

1626
00:56:53,358 --> 00:56:58,400
different

1627
00:56:54,559 --> 00:57:00,880
level of citrus onto it that influence

1628
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:02,880
is just something that will be unique

1629
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:04,480
yeah for sure yeah

1630
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:06,400
so that's kind of what i was looking for

1631
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:07,519
to improve on that straw mana while

1632
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:09,358
keeping like

1633
00:57:07,519 --> 00:57:11,679
definitely all the unique

1634
00:57:09,358 --> 00:57:13,920
characteristics of it and the positives

1635
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:17,199
from it that people enjoy

1636
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:18,480
he really is an ash producer

1637
00:57:17,199 --> 00:57:21,679
and that's one of the things that i

1638
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:23,920
appreciate about you maddie is uh

1639
00:57:21,679 --> 00:57:26,960
a lot of people know me for like hunting

1640
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:29,119
through land races or [ __ ] with true

1641
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:32,000
hybrids or heirlooms and things like

1642
00:57:29,119 --> 00:57:34,160
that and i i'm just not into a lot of

1643
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:36,159
the more modern stuff but one of the

1644
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:37,358
things that i constantly tell my guys is

1645
00:57:36,159 --> 00:57:39,358
if i'm going to [ __ ] with modern

1646
00:57:37,358 --> 00:57:41,679
genetics like it's going to be maddie's

1647
00:57:39,358 --> 00:57:43,279
he's already impressed me multiple times

1648
00:57:41,679 --> 00:57:44,719
and now you're taking

1649
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:48,079
my [ __ ]

1650
00:57:44,719 --> 00:57:50,000
the one i love grapefruit and i'm not so

1651
00:57:48,079 --> 00:57:51,839
familiar with the straw nana i have

1652
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:53,920
smoked it a couple times and i love the

1653
00:57:51,838 --> 00:57:56,480
terps on it but i did grow the

1654
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:57,920
strawberry mamba number four for quite a

1655
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:59,838
while i don't know if you're familiar

1656
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:01,680
with that one at all yes i've heard of

1657
00:57:59,838 --> 00:58:04,639
it for sure i've never um

1658
00:58:01,679 --> 00:58:06,879
i've never played with it myself

1659
00:58:04,639 --> 00:58:09,118
it's really similar

1660
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:11,440
very similar to like the straw nana

1661
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:14,318
flavors with less of the banana more

1662
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:16,880
focus on that strawberry but a very very

1663
00:58:14,318 --> 00:58:19,119
similar strawberry taste nice

1664
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:21,680
and i've grown that one

1665
00:58:19,119 --> 00:58:24,240
so much just because of the flavor on it

1666
00:58:21,679 --> 00:58:26,000
and i cannot see that match up between

1667
00:58:24,239 --> 00:58:29,039
your straw nana and the

1668
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:31,199
and the grapefruit going bad in any way

1669
00:58:29,039 --> 00:58:32,480
i don't think so i think everything that

1670
00:58:31,199 --> 00:58:34,078
we've seen

1671
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:37,079
is just

1672
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:37,079
wow

1673
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:43,440
wow man well here's another one

1674
00:58:40,079 --> 00:58:46,160
it's just another one yeah you know

1675
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:47,920
and that's one well i'm in that stage

1676
00:58:46,159 --> 00:58:50,239
right now where i'm really

1677
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:53,280
i'm doing a lot more dabs my wife she's

1678
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:54,959
a huge dabber so concentrates has been a

1679
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:56,960
big focus in our garden lately and

1680
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:58,318
that's like you said this is one of the

1681
00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:00,480
things that you kind of breed for is

1682
00:58:58,318 --> 00:59:01,679
hash production terpenes

1683
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:04,240
yeah so

1684
00:59:01,679 --> 00:59:05,759
taking you know in a lot of those old

1685
00:59:04,239 --> 00:59:07,598
cultivars they don't

1686
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:09,680
have a return like some of the more

1687
00:59:07,599 --> 00:59:12,079
modern ones do the resin populations

1688
00:59:09,679 --> 00:59:14,078
just weren't as bred in at that time you

1689
00:59:12,079 --> 00:59:17,200
know nope they just weren't

1690
00:59:14,079 --> 00:59:18,720
so it's nice to have some things that

1691
00:59:17,199 --> 00:59:21,118
you're putting out there like this that

1692
00:59:18,719 --> 00:59:23,279
are more modern get that hash production

1693
00:59:21,119 --> 00:59:26,000
so we can really enjoy [ __ ] around

1694
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:27,839
learning hash oh absolutely and then i

1695
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,440
just love to see it

1696
00:59:27,838 --> 00:59:31,440
there's so many other things now that's

1697
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:34,240
why i'm trying to get it i've been

1698
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:35,200
getting them but you know always looking

1699
00:59:34,239 --> 00:59:37,838
for

1700
00:59:35,199 --> 00:59:40,000
new hash companies anybody that

1701
00:59:37,838 --> 00:59:41,838
is doing really

1702
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:44,559
amazing work

1703
00:59:41,838 --> 00:59:48,239
with sovereignness extractions

1704
00:59:44,559 --> 00:59:51,119
and or hydrocarbon extractions that

1705
00:59:48,239 --> 00:59:53,598
solely looking for those type of things

1706
00:59:51,119 --> 00:59:56,079
love to work with them i've worked with

1707
00:59:53,599 --> 00:59:58,160
a few and am working with

1708
00:59:56,079 --> 01:00:01,519
guys that are doing that

1709
00:59:58,159 --> 01:00:04,480
and i think it's an amazing combo

1710
01:00:01,519 --> 01:00:06,318
oh yes i've always enjoyed that the most

1711
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:08,798
don't get me wrong i'm a flower person

1712
01:00:06,318 --> 01:00:11,519
i've always smoked flour but

1713
01:00:08,798 --> 01:00:15,599
i think a healthier

1714
01:00:11,519 --> 01:00:17,519
way of consuming the cannabis is

1715
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:19,119
cash i think i believe it's super

1716
01:00:17,519 --> 01:00:22,000
enjoyable

1717
01:00:19,119 --> 01:00:24,000
the one good thing about modern cannabis

1718
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:25,039
is the testing and all the good things

1719
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:27,280
so there's a little bit more

1720
01:00:25,039 --> 01:00:29,440
transparency on products that

1721
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:32,160
patients are able to receive

1722
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:33,679
so that to me is definitely a plus

1723
01:00:32,159 --> 01:00:35,679
side on

1724
01:00:33,679 --> 01:00:38,239
modern cannabis as well

1725
01:00:35,679 --> 01:00:40,000
um and everything ever changing in

1726
01:00:38,239 --> 01:00:41,679
the markets it's

1727
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,519
you know making sure that everything's

1728
01:00:41,679 --> 01:00:44,719
transparent and

1729
01:00:43,519 --> 01:00:46,079
to be honest with you when you're

1730
01:00:44,719 --> 01:00:48,159
dealing with patients you should be

1731
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:50,000
putting the utmost care into everything

1732
01:00:48,159 --> 01:00:52,318
that we do because at the end of the day

1733
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:55,358
this is their medicine and if they're

1734
01:00:52,318 --> 01:00:57,519
not capable of supplying their own

1735
01:00:55,358 --> 01:00:59,358
medicine or they're in a state that

1736
01:00:57,519 --> 01:01:01,599
maybe they can't yet

1737
01:00:59,358 --> 01:01:03,199
these genetics and or

1738
01:01:01,599 --> 01:01:04,720
ones like it

1739
01:01:03,199 --> 01:01:06,879
in the right hands you know their

1740
01:01:04,719 --> 01:01:08,000
caregiver or someone else that can do it

1741
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:11,119
for them

1742
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:13,679
with that availability to that is just

1743
01:01:11,119 --> 01:01:15,280
amazing and thus it should be we have a

1744
01:01:13,679 --> 01:01:17,039
responsibility

1745
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:18,400
to these people

1746
01:01:17,039 --> 01:01:20,159
i mean i feel like if you're gonna put

1747
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:22,639
the time and effort into something that

1748
01:01:20,159 --> 01:01:25,118
it should be an expression of you so not

1749
01:01:22,639 --> 01:01:27,598
i'm not just selling or

1750
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:29,519
telling people about what i make but i'm

1751
01:01:27,599 --> 01:01:30,798
also telling them about me

1752
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:32,239
and

1753
01:01:30,798 --> 01:01:33,838
that's just as

1754
01:01:32,239 --> 01:01:34,959
it's an important part of it because

1755
01:01:33,838 --> 01:01:36,000
that's why

1756
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:38,639
in

1757
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:41,119
what influenced what everyone is seeing

1758
01:01:38,639 --> 01:01:41,920
now and starting to see and has been

1759
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:44,240
seen

1760
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:46,480
yeah you know and just it opens up every

1761
01:01:44,239 --> 01:01:48,078
day to more and more people

1762
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:51,280
and i'm you know i'll go right back to

1763
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:54,480
it i'm never so ever grateful

1764
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:56,798
and just humbled that i'm still able

1765
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:59,679
to keep doing what i'm doing and put

1766
01:01:56,798 --> 01:02:01,838
smiles on people's faces

1767
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:03,279
that's the biggest part to me and seeing

1768
01:02:01,838 --> 01:02:05,038
people get relief because at the end of

1769
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:07,280
the day when i started this i did it for

1770
01:02:05,039 --> 01:02:08,799
that i was a patient

1771
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:10,480
and someone that

1772
01:02:08,798 --> 01:02:12,239
it was easier for me for me to be a

1773
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:15,280
patient to take the street element out

1774
01:02:12,239 --> 01:02:17,679
of it and do these things for myself

1775
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:19,680
that i like

1776
01:02:17,679 --> 01:02:22,318
so let's get a couple quick fire

1777
01:02:19,679 --> 01:02:25,440
questions in before we get going here i

1778
01:02:22,318 --> 01:02:27,599
had one of my patreon members cue ball

1779
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:28,639
had a couple questions for you he wanted

1780
01:02:27,599 --> 01:02:30,400
to know

1781
01:02:28,639 --> 01:02:31,598
what have you produced which one of your

1782
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:32,400
cultivars

1783
01:02:31,599 --> 01:02:34,318
is

1784
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:36,000
the strongest on the nose which one's

1785
01:02:34,318 --> 01:02:38,318
going to pack that in your face what's

1786
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:40,159
the first one that comes to mind as far

1787
01:02:38,318 --> 01:02:43,119
as your nose

1788
01:02:40,159 --> 01:02:44,719
anything with that the the

1789
01:02:43,119 --> 01:02:46,880
z-whiz male

1790
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:48,798
everything with that z-wisp

1791
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:50,559
and then the grapefruit

1792
01:02:48,798 --> 01:02:53,519
grapefruit is just

1793
01:02:50,559 --> 01:02:54,240
that's what she is

1794
01:02:53,519 --> 01:02:57,519
yeah

1795
01:02:54,239 --> 01:02:59,759
they just do it it's uh it's just so

1796
01:02:57,519 --> 01:03:01,679
prominent no matter what it touched it

1797
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:03,599
wasn't gonna you can't water it that's

1798
01:03:01,679 --> 01:03:05,279
the reason why keeping all my

1799
01:03:03,599 --> 01:03:07,119
expressions open

1800
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:09,599
so it doesn't get muddled or

1801
01:03:07,119 --> 01:03:11,358
bottlenecked into just one thing

1802
01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:14,079
that was my biggest fear i want to keep

1803
01:03:11,358 --> 01:03:16,480
the drugs alive and the terpenes alive

1804
01:03:14,079 --> 01:03:17,440
because i can always improve on

1805
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:20,000
for sure

1806
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:23,200
he also wanted to know how you went

1807
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:25,440
about your pollinations when you

1808
01:03:23,199 --> 01:03:27,838
find a male that you want to work with

1809
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:29,519
is it you're sticking it in a room with

1810
01:03:27,838 --> 01:03:32,159
everything that you think it might pair

1811
01:03:29,519 --> 01:03:33,920
up well with or are you more

1812
01:03:32,159 --> 01:03:35,118
taking the role of the bee and hand

1813
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:37,680
pollinating

1814
01:03:35,119 --> 01:03:40,318
so no to be honest with you

1815
01:03:37,679 --> 01:03:43,279
i like to open pollinate so i like to

1816
01:03:40,318 --> 01:03:45,599
have the males in with the females

1817
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:47,839
and throughout the process i will

1818
01:03:45,599 --> 01:03:50,160
collect some pollen and the only reason

1819
01:03:47,838 --> 01:03:52,159
that i'll go in and touch certain things

1820
01:03:50,159 --> 01:03:53,358
is just for consistency throughout the

1821
01:03:52,159 --> 01:03:55,279
plant

1822
01:03:53,358 --> 01:03:57,679
for the most part i let it do its own

1823
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:58,960
natural thing that's that's all it's

1824
01:03:57,679 --> 01:04:00,879
supposed to be

1825
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:01,920
good deal do i help influence that a

1826
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:03,119
little bit

1827
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:05,760
i have

1828
01:04:03,119 --> 01:04:08,079
um i have gone in and say like if it's

1829
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:09,760
in the corner of the room even though i

1830
01:04:08,079 --> 01:04:11,200
rotate the plants

1831
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:12,559
if it's like

1832
01:04:11,199 --> 01:04:15,358
in the middle of the plant and i feel

1833
01:04:12,559 --> 01:04:17,280
like it might not get as much

1834
01:04:15,358 --> 01:04:19,598
of the pollen as i needed to i'll go in

1835
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:20,798
and hit a couple breaths just to ensure

1836
01:04:19,599 --> 01:04:23,599
but the biggest

1837
01:04:20,798 --> 01:04:25,679
my thing is over pollination i open

1838
01:04:23,599 --> 01:04:28,160
how do you limit yourself on how many

1839
01:04:25,679 --> 01:04:30,000
males you'd use in that room

1840
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:32,318
obviously you're taking females with

1841
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:34,480
different expressions that you want to

1842
01:04:32,318 --> 01:04:36,239
that you want to put forward in that

1843
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:37,838
next generation but

1844
01:04:36,239 --> 01:04:41,118
how do you know it's going to be two or

1845
01:04:37,838 --> 01:04:43,038
three you know or how do i get it down

1846
01:04:41,119 --> 01:04:45,519
like on one strain how do i narrow it

1847
01:04:43,039 --> 01:04:47,280
down to one or how do i

1848
01:04:45,519 --> 01:04:49,519
is that where you're doing one male with

1849
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:51,519
you i'm narrowing it down to each yeah

1850
01:04:49,519 --> 01:04:53,358
so each uh

1851
01:04:51,519 --> 01:04:54,798
each train that i've picked the mail

1852
01:04:53,358 --> 01:04:56,000
from

1853
01:04:54,798 --> 01:04:59,199
is the

1854
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:00,880
the biggest things are stability

1855
01:04:59,199 --> 01:05:03,358
resilience

1856
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:05,039
as far as stress it can handle all the

1857
01:05:03,358 --> 01:05:06,480
stresses that i'm

1858
01:05:05,039 --> 01:05:08,799
and then

1859
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:10,559
on that positive note if it passes those

1860
01:05:08,798 --> 01:05:12,239
tests

1861
01:05:10,559 --> 01:05:14,400
it has something to bring to the table

1862
01:05:12,239 --> 01:05:15,759
it's always going to make whatever

1863
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:18,240
female that i'm

1864
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:19,680
uh pairing with it later it's always to

1865
01:05:18,239 --> 01:05:21,199
make it cool

1866
01:05:19,679 --> 01:05:23,838
okay so you're looking for something

1867
01:05:21,199 --> 01:05:25,838
that's not going to pass on any unwanted

1868
01:05:23,838 --> 01:05:28,078
straights but still keep the genetic

1869
01:05:25,838 --> 01:05:30,239
lines open enough where there's enough

1870
01:05:28,079 --> 01:05:31,599
possibilities from all over the board

1871
01:05:30,239 --> 01:05:33,759
within that strain that makes sense

1872
01:05:31,599 --> 01:05:35,838
that's that's awesome

1873
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:38,079
that's my biggest thing that's what i'm

1874
01:05:35,838 --> 01:05:39,199
looking for in a male and then i choose

1875
01:05:38,079 --> 01:05:40,079
to keep them

1876
01:05:39,199 --> 01:05:42,239
you know

1877
01:05:40,079 --> 01:05:43,839
on the grapefruits in the beginning we

1878
01:05:42,239 --> 01:05:45,519
used a couple different males and then

1879
01:05:43,838 --> 01:05:46,558
we just kept the mail

1880
01:05:45,519 --> 01:05:48,838
and then

1881
01:05:46,559 --> 01:05:52,319
due to unforeseen

1882
01:05:48,838 --> 01:05:54,960
circumstances wasn't able to keep it so

1883
01:05:52,318 --> 01:05:56,719
then moving forward

1884
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:58,000
going through a huge building project

1885
01:05:56,719 --> 01:05:59,679
with the building

1886
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:01,358
i just didn't have the time to either

1887
01:05:59,679 --> 01:06:03,598
keep played

1888
01:06:01,358 --> 01:06:05,279
didn't have time or space to

1889
01:06:03,599 --> 01:06:08,160
play games with

1890
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:09,839
doing that at that point so that was you

1891
01:06:08,159 --> 01:06:11,679
know the reason for

1892
01:06:09,838 --> 01:06:13,838
talking with chris

1893
01:06:11,679 --> 01:06:14,960
to keep things moving forward while i

1894
01:06:13,838 --> 01:06:16,639
could

1895
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:18,400
and also to him

1896
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:22,159
i knew he would love them just because

1897
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:23,358
he's a pure sativa citrus tropical fruit

1898
01:06:22,159 --> 01:06:25,920
person who

1899
01:06:23,358 --> 01:06:27,679
remembers this grapefruit and

1900
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:28,559
enjoyed it just as much as all of us

1901
01:06:27,679 --> 01:06:30,078
have

1902
01:06:28,559 --> 01:06:32,720
oh hell yeah

1903
01:06:30,079 --> 01:06:33,599
it's definitely a good icebreaker strain

1904
01:06:32,719 --> 01:06:35,598
when

1905
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:36,798
i talk about the grapefruit i can always

1906
01:06:35,599 --> 01:06:38,000
tell some of the guys that have been

1907
01:06:36,798 --> 01:06:39,599
growing a little bit longer because

1908
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:42,239
they'll break out and be like oh yeah

1909
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:44,480
man i remember the sweet pink you know

1910
01:06:42,239 --> 01:06:47,118
i used to grow that outdoor

1911
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:48,480
cause it was it was a tried and true

1912
01:06:47,119 --> 01:06:50,559
yeah for sure

1913
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:54,240
i feel like she was like one of those

1914
01:06:50,559 --> 01:06:54,240
that fell between the cracks

1915
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:59,519
like a bunch of other amazing

1916
01:06:56,798 --> 01:07:02,318
cultivators as well but

1917
01:06:59,519 --> 01:07:03,599
well wasn't it it was originally a skunk

1918
01:07:02,318 --> 01:07:05,838
phenotype

1919
01:07:03,599 --> 01:07:08,079
7099

1920
01:07:05,838 --> 01:07:09,920
that's right sweet tooth

1921
01:07:08,079 --> 01:07:13,359
northern lights

1922
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:15,920
originally came out of british columbia

1923
01:07:13,358 --> 01:07:17,920
there was more in it than just the c99

1924
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:21,200
that is what it was the sc-99 that's

1925
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:23,358
where that's that citrus came from yep

1926
01:07:21,199 --> 01:07:25,519
at least that's what's documented anyway

1927
01:07:23,358 --> 01:07:27,440
of what i understand well yeah there's

1928
01:07:25,519 --> 01:07:29,038
only so much that we can know if you

1929
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:30,480
weren't there

1930
01:07:29,039 --> 01:07:31,920
yeah i mean it's a little deeper than

1931
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:34,400
just that but

1932
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:36,318
just for a basement like a basic

1933
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:38,798
that's kind of like

1934
01:07:36,318 --> 01:07:40,960
the founding right there the building

1935
01:07:38,798 --> 01:07:42,639
blocks so to say

1936
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:45,358
for sure so

1937
01:07:42,639 --> 01:07:46,879
did you have any shows coming up i do i

1938
01:07:45,358 --> 01:07:50,239
have uh

1939
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:52,000
oh god we have uh the bonfire coming up

1940
01:07:50,239 --> 01:07:54,719
in april

1941
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:56,480
which is down in lebanon maine

1942
01:07:54,719 --> 01:08:00,639
we also have

1943
01:07:56,480 --> 01:08:02,318
a mmcm show coming in august

1944
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:04,960
in augusta maine

1945
01:08:02,318 --> 01:08:06,798
for that will be a two-day show

1946
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:09,039
and then we always have

1947
01:08:06,798 --> 01:08:10,719
every two weeks we do a show here

1948
01:08:09,039 --> 01:08:13,440
the local people

1949
01:08:10,719 --> 01:08:15,519
and just to get you know all these guys

1950
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:18,239
with a bunch of you know they get to

1951
01:08:15,519 --> 01:08:20,560
meet a bunch of different caregivers and

1952
01:08:18,238 --> 01:08:21,919
guys like myself as well

1953
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:24,480
so they get you know some of these

1954
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:26,798
genetics in their hands whereas you know

1955
01:08:24,479 --> 01:08:29,519
without those they wouldn't be able to

1956
01:08:26,798 --> 01:08:31,759
oh yeah now with the website open that

1957
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:34,640
gives so much more availability and

1958
01:08:31,759 --> 01:08:36,000
obviously social media as well

1959
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:38,400
that's cool that you're still taking

1960
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:40,079
time out for the locals though oh that's

1961
01:08:38,399 --> 01:08:42,798
the most important part i mean if it

1962
01:08:40,079 --> 01:08:43,759
wasn't for those guys i wouldn't even

1963
01:08:42,798 --> 01:08:45,519
have

1964
01:08:43,759 --> 01:08:47,119
gotten those genetics in my hand to be

1965
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:49,839
honest

1966
01:08:47,119 --> 01:08:51,679
that's awesome yeah really i mean that's

1967
01:08:49,838 --> 01:08:53,519
always always to those roots because

1968
01:08:51,679 --> 01:08:55,279
that's where it all started that's

1969
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:57,040
that's what it is i mean

1970
01:08:55,279 --> 01:08:58,560
i was one of those patients before

1971
01:08:57,039 --> 01:09:00,880
anything so

1972
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:02,080
always keep it there never forget

1973
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:04,719

if you're a caregiver

1987
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:36,079
trying to diversify defies yourself as

1988
01:09:34,719 --> 01:09:37,920
far as being in

1989
01:09:36,079 --> 01:09:39,519
dispensaries or your local shops and

1990
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:41,039
having something different so it's not

1991
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:43,600
all the same

1992
01:09:41,039 --> 01:09:46,560
keeping that market open and

1993
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:48,798
regular instead of just everyone

1994
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:50,798
always doing the same things i think

1995
01:09:48,798 --> 01:09:52,719
that's the future and keeping things

1996
01:09:50,798 --> 01:09:55,279
like this and from other people that i

1997
01:09:52,719 --> 01:09:57,679
work with is a good way to start

1998
01:09:55,279 --> 01:09:59,279
that other like i said that release that

1999
01:09:57,679 --> 01:10:01,199
three pack

2000
01:09:59,279 --> 01:10:04,238

savory sorbet and then that strawberry

2002
01:10:04,238 --> 01:10:08,799
the strawberry grapefruit bananas

2003
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:11,359
i'm going to

2004
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:13,679
do another drop of those

2005
01:10:11,359 --> 01:10:15,198
like 50 packs

2006
01:10:13,679 --> 01:10:16,560
and i'm just gonna run it till they're

2007
01:10:15,198 --> 01:10:18,158
gone and

2008
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:21,280
depending on when i started it'll

2009
01:10:18,158 --> 01:10:23,039
probably run to the end of february

2010
01:10:21,279 --> 01:10:25,198
good because i'm going to do it and then

2011

that's awesome man yeah i just want to

2019
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:43,520
make sure that the availability is there

2020
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:45,520
and give people a shot

2021
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:46,800
good i was definitely

2022
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:48,080
trying to give other people the

2023
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:49,920
opportunity to get some of the

2024
01:10:48,079 --> 01:10:50,800
strawberry grapefruit banana for you and

2025
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:52,239
not hoard them

2026
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:53,600
[Laughter]

2027
01:10:52,238 --> 01:10:56,319
i'm glad you're putting them back out

2028
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:57,920
there because i still want more

2029
01:10:56,319 --> 01:11:00,960
the other one that really went like the

2030
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:03,199
sorbet went i think once everybody sees

2031
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:05,359
it the ones that went out once everybody

2032
01:11:03,198 --> 01:11:07,919
start seeing those but the uh

2033
01:11:05,359 --> 01:11:11,599
the savory sorbet that aside berry uh

2034
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:14,000
gelato onto the cushman's 11 times gmo

2035
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:15,440
awesome you did send me some of those no

2036
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:17,520
brainer

2037
01:11:15,439 --> 01:11:20,238
i never grew the cushman's i've never

2038
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:22,080
even seen it honestly so like i said i'd

2039
01:11:20,238 --> 01:11:24,319
smoke so much old [ __ ] and that's what

2040
01:11:22,079 --> 01:11:26,000
i'm on to all the time it's pretty you

2041
01:11:24,319 --> 01:11:27,759
know other than you and professor p's

2042
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:29,679
gear there's not a lot of modern stuff i

2043
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:32,560
grow what was so great about the

2044
01:11:29,679 --> 01:11:35,359
cushman's ah the vigor

2045
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:37,840
it was like i like this particular

2046
01:11:35,359 --> 01:11:41,119
gelato hybrid it

2047
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:43,679
doesn't have it's not like like the 41

2048
01:11:41,119 --> 01:11:45,198
is good my personal opinion

2049
01:11:43,679 --> 01:11:47,359
i really

2050
01:11:45,198 --> 01:11:51,678
enjoyed the flavor

2051
01:11:47,359 --> 01:11:54,238
of the 33. i hate the veg time on it

2052
01:11:51,679 --> 01:11:57,359
but the blood structure the effects from

2053
01:11:54,238 --> 01:11:59,678
it are medicinal as well also adds i

2054
01:11:57,359 --> 01:12:00,719
mean obviously a beautiful color

2055
01:11:59,679 --> 01:12:03,600
without

2056
01:12:00,719 --> 01:12:05,359
influencing the flavor in a negative way

2057
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:06,400
and so

2058
01:12:05,359 --> 01:12:08,559
my

2059
01:12:06,399 --> 01:12:09,519
obviously again trying to make it better

2060
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:12,000
had

2061
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:13,760
less bench time to it

2062
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:16,640
the male had

2063
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:18,000
amazing color to it and then it was just

2064
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:20,840
like

2065
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:25,039
creamy doughy

2066
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:27,600
gassy heavy resin populations

2067
01:12:25,039 --> 01:12:28,560
amongst the calyxes just really super

2068
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:31,600
dense

2069
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:33,199
so another reason why i wanted to use it

2070
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:34,400
basically the same reason why i wanted

2071
01:12:33,198 --> 01:12:35,599
to use the

2072
01:12:34,399 --> 01:12:38,079
z-whiz

2073
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:39,280
but to have a different flavor and then

2074
01:12:38,079 --> 01:12:41,119
add it to

2075
01:12:39,279 --> 01:12:42,079
similar things and or different things

2076
01:12:41,119 --> 01:12:45,119
as well

2077
01:12:42,079 --> 01:12:48,000
i mean i made f2s of those and

2078
01:12:45,119 --> 01:12:49,359
and then obviously a multitude of

2079
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:51,279
hybrids

2080
01:12:49,359 --> 01:12:54,238
everything she touches

2081
01:12:51,279 --> 01:12:57,359
as far as a gelato like she actually has

2082
01:12:54,238 --> 01:12:58,799
that same blood structure as the 33.

2083
01:12:57,359 --> 01:13:00,399
more denser

2084
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:02,640
from the cushman's

2085
01:13:00,399 --> 01:13:04,238
really harder like definitely harder

2086
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:05,119
buds so you're going to get your weight

2087
01:13:04,238 --> 01:13:06,000
and then

2088
01:13:05,119 --> 01:13:09,279
like

2089
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:12,079
such a dense resin population now

2090
01:13:09,279 --> 01:13:16,960
the thing i didn't like about the gelato

2091
01:13:12,079 --> 01:13:18,399
33 unlike the 41 is that the 41 had

2092
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:20,800
better heads

2093
01:13:18,399 --> 01:13:23,039
it more resin

2094
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:25,279
the 33 had resin

2095
01:13:23,039 --> 01:13:27,439
super nice high but as far as extracts

2096
01:13:25,279 --> 01:13:29,198
it really wasn't a great yield

2097
01:13:27,439 --> 01:13:31,279
so i'm like man i'd really like to get

2098
01:13:29,198 --> 01:13:33,759
this terpene profile

2099
01:13:31,279 --> 01:13:35,759
possibly maybe even draw some color out

2100
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:37,119
of it but i'd love to pack some more

2101
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:38,800
resin in this thing

2102
01:13:37,119 --> 01:13:39,920
and that's what that mail brings to the

2103
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:41,520
table

2104
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:43,520
nice

2105
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:45,760
that's good to hear that's exciting man

2106
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:47,600
yeah man they're really nice everyone

2107
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:49,920
that's been going through those are just

2108
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:51,520
super excited definitely

2109
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:52,719
happy about all the results they're

2110
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:54,640
getting

2111
01:13:52,719 --> 01:13:57,198
and yeah i can now they like there'll be

2112
01:13:54,640 --> 01:13:59,280
some more future work with those too

2113
01:13:57,198 --> 01:14:01,678
so yeah i look forward to that as well

2114
01:13:59,279 --> 01:14:03,359
just seeing what everybody's

2115
01:14:01,679 --> 01:14:05,039
keep on hearing what everybody's saying

2116
01:14:03,359 --> 01:14:07,279
about them keep getting them out there

2117
01:14:05,039 --> 01:14:09,359
so more people get them and start really

2118
01:14:07,279 --> 01:14:10,158
looking at bigger populations of them

2119
01:14:09,359 --> 01:14:12,000
and

2120
01:14:10,158 --> 01:14:13,439
i love to hear all the unique things

2121
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:15,279
that come out of a manner you know just

2122
01:14:13,439 --> 01:14:17,439
like your story with the

2123
01:14:15,279 --> 01:14:19,359
with the mountain wizard

2124
01:14:17,439 --> 01:14:21,519
that was so fun

2125
01:14:19,359 --> 01:14:23,839
that entire hunt there was so many

2126
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:26,000
expressions and none of them were bad it

2127
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:27,920
was just a pleasing hunt all around like

2128
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:32,000
you said they were really really

2129
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:34,079
resilient to everything stable beautiful

2130
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:36,960
bag appeal was off the wall some more

2131
01:14:34,079 --> 01:14:39,279
than others but all of them were good

2132
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:40,480
every flavor every smell every hive was

2133
01:14:39,279 --> 01:14:42,399
all good

2134
01:14:40,479 --> 01:14:43,919
i did not have one complaint throughout

2135
01:14:42,399 --> 01:14:46,158
that entire thing

2136
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:48,000
thank you i appreciate that man that's

2137
01:14:46,158 --> 01:14:50,639
what that's what i did it for go in and

2138
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:52,238
hit a couple breaks just to ensure

2139
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:53,679
all right before we get going here we

2140

01:15:44,158 --> 01:15:51,119
a couple more that you thought were

2167
01:15:46,719 --> 01:15:51,119
really close to that is there any more

2168
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:55,679
you're like i think this represents solo

2169
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:57,840
so

2170
01:15:55,679 --> 01:16:01,760
ah god

2171
01:15:57,840 --> 01:16:01,760
i do have an answer for that

2172
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:06,158
it's a hard question

2173
01:16:03,679 --> 01:16:07,679
it's a super hard question

2174
01:16:06,158 --> 01:16:09,439
so

2175
01:16:07,679 --> 01:16:12,158
i'd have to say that

2176
01:16:09,439 --> 01:16:14,319
that zewi's work is definitely i'm proud

2177
01:16:12,158 --> 01:16:16,799
of that work

2178
01:16:14,319 --> 01:16:19,279
i really am because of

2179
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:22,000
the time it took to pair everything that

2180
01:16:19,279 --> 01:16:23,679
i put in to pair with it

2181
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:26,000
with that intention

2182
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:27,440
knowing that it would pair well

2183
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:29,119
um

2184
01:16:27,439 --> 01:16:31,198
i guess

2185
01:16:29,119 --> 01:16:34,399
the other one i really like

2186
01:16:31,198 --> 01:16:37,359
that's a part one of that sub this is a

2187
01:16:34,399 --> 01:16:39,519
sub part of that second part okay

2188
01:16:37,359 --> 01:16:43,039
the one that i'm really second most

2189
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:44,080
proud of is just still not available to

2190
01:16:43,039 --> 01:16:45,119
anyone

2191
01:16:44,079 --> 01:16:46,840
oh

2192
01:16:45,119 --> 01:16:50,079
as things come

2193
01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:51,279
forward in the future

2194
01:16:50,079 --> 01:16:54,479
you

2195
01:16:51,279 --> 01:16:56,880
and a few other specific people will get

2196
01:16:54,479 --> 01:16:58,158
those in their hands

2197
01:16:56,880 --> 01:17:00,719
for

2198
01:16:58,158 --> 01:17:02,879
so many reasons and

2199
01:17:00,719 --> 01:17:05,198
first off is just

2200
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:07,520
the amount of passion

2201
01:17:05,198 --> 01:17:09,599
love and dedication

2202
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:13,040
that you put into it among

2203
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:15,280
a few other very select individuals

2204
01:17:13,039 --> 01:17:16,800
that i really want to get these into

2205
01:17:15,279 --> 01:17:18,960
your hands because

2206
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:20,400
i know at the end of the day you guys

2207
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:22,319
are going to do

2208
01:17:20,399 --> 01:17:24,799
the best work for

2209
01:17:22,319 --> 01:17:27,840
yourselves and myself included for the

2210
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:28,960
common good for everyone else

2211
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:31,440
somebody

2212
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:33,039
i just i can't see what it is yet right

2213
01:17:31,439 --> 01:17:35,119
now but it's

2214
01:17:33,039 --> 01:17:36,880
something that definitely something that

2215
01:17:35,119 --> 01:17:38,399
i'm super proud of

2216
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:40,640
dude i'm excited i don't even know what

2217
01:17:38,399 --> 01:17:42,399
the [ __ ] it is this is not something

2218
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:45,920
you've told me before you just dropped

2219
01:17:42,399 --> 01:17:48,639
this on me during the podcast

2220
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:51,760
so maybe something to keep

2221
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:54,159
everybody looking forward to i know i am

2222
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:56,000
i'm so looking forward to it

2223
01:17:54,158 --> 01:17:58,479
hell yeah are we working with the time

2224
01:17:56,000 --> 01:18:03,399
frame here

2225
01:17:58,479 --> 01:18:03,399
i would say that i'd say by 2024

2226
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:06,719
they will be

2227
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:11,120
yeah

2228
01:18:06,719 --> 01:18:13,439
yeah i'd say like maybe the end of 2023

2229
01:18:11,119 --> 01:18:15,599
to 2024

2230
01:18:13,439 --> 01:18:17,919
just depending on

2231
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:20,239
how everything works out it's just

2232
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:22,719
really it could all within a three

2233
01:18:20,238 --> 01:18:25,279
to six month of that i would say that's

2234
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:27,039
that's the best guesstimate that i can

2235
01:18:25,279 --> 01:18:28,319
you know that's a good thing though that

2236
01:18:27,039 --> 01:18:30,158
is a good thing if you're already

2237
01:18:28,319 --> 01:18:32,238
excited about it now and you've got that

2238
01:18:30,158 --> 01:18:35,279
much more time to work with it because

2239
01:18:32,238 --> 01:18:37,198
no one knows about it

2240
01:18:35,279 --> 01:18:38,880
and you got to keep it that way i got

2241
01:18:37,198 --> 01:18:42,238
you i got it

2242
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:44,960
like there's i can't even fill up on one

2243
01:18:42,238 --> 01:18:46,319
hand how many people know okay and or

2244
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:48,000
are involved

2245
01:18:46,319 --> 01:18:50,319
yeah so

2246
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:51,600
this right here is gonna be another

2247
01:18:50,319 --> 01:18:53,119
testament

2248
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:55,440
i'm hoping

2249
01:18:53,119 --> 01:18:59,760
for fall

2250
01:18:55,439 --> 01:19:02,319
late winter like maybe early winter

2251
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:04,560
for f5 work

2252
01:19:02,319 --> 01:19:05,920
we'll see we'll just see how

2253
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:08,400
on the grapefruit

2254
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:10,239
yeah on the grapefruit f5s

2255
01:19:08,399 --> 01:19:11,439
and i'm looking forward to those as well

2256
01:19:10,238 --> 01:19:13,119
and i know

2257
01:19:11,439 --> 01:19:14,799
i just want people to keep enjoying

2258
01:19:13,119 --> 01:19:16,800
these that far's

2259
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:19,840
don't think that

2260
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:21,600
the f4 is going to be like the f5 it's

2261
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:23,279
not that it's not going to be a better

2262
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:26,079
version

2263
01:19:23,279 --> 01:19:28,559
it's just going to be

2264
01:19:26,079 --> 01:19:32,079
i'm using a different expression from

2265
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:33,280
the original expression the f2s

2266
01:19:32,079 --> 01:19:35,920
and then

2267
01:19:33,279 --> 01:19:37,840
going into another like you know i had

2268
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:40,719
the a b c and d

2269
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:42,079
i'm going into another one of those

2270
01:19:40,719 --> 01:19:44,800
because i

2271
01:19:42,079 --> 01:19:47,198
it was just a few different reasons and

2272
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:49,279
i think it's really just going to end up

2273
01:19:47,198 --> 01:19:51,198
because the end goal for me

2274
01:19:49,279 --> 01:19:53,039
is to i always want to keep that

2275
01:19:51,198 --> 01:19:53,839
expression i'm not going to be selfish

2276
01:19:53,039 --> 01:19:55,920
and say

2277
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:57,840
all you get is uh sweet pink grapefruit

2278
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:59,840
that's it

2279
01:19:57,840 --> 01:20:01,760
i don't want anyone to ever get that i

2280
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:04,239
still want everyone to get and find

2281
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:05,760
those unique ones that make their garden

2282
01:20:04,238 --> 01:20:07,599
stand out

2283
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:09,440
really helps them out

2284
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:10,159
individually i want everybody

2285
01:20:09,439 --> 01:20:12,079
to

2286
01:20:10,158 --> 01:20:13,198
experience everything grapefruit has to

2287
01:20:12,079 --> 01:20:15,840
offer

2288
01:20:13,198 --> 01:20:17,678
well yeah exactly kind of like

2289
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:19,360
kind of pick your own version of it that

2290
01:20:17,679 --> 01:20:20,960
you like because everybody's taste buds

2291
01:20:19,359 --> 01:20:22,799
are just a little different

2292
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:26,719
yeah and what i smell

2293
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:29,520
doesn't necessarily mean you do or taste

2294
01:20:26,719 --> 01:20:31,119
yeah same plant but everyone can

2295
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:32,960
get that taste but you know depending

2296
01:20:31,119 --> 01:20:35,119
like if you're a cigarette smoker you're

2297
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:36,319
going to taste it different if you're

2298
01:20:35,119 --> 01:20:38,719
this you know

2299
01:20:36,319 --> 01:20:41,439
there's too many variables but yeah i'm

2300
01:20:38,719 --> 01:20:42,800
trying to definitely keep it where

2301
01:20:41,439 --> 01:20:45,119
it's open

2302
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:47,440
it keeps everybody kind of like wow yeah

2303
01:20:45,119 --> 01:20:48,880
there's that well there it is but then

2304
01:20:47,439 --> 01:20:51,119
wow what is this

2305
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:53,679
holy you know

2306
01:20:51,119 --> 01:20:54,719
awesome dude i'm very stoked i'm very

2307
01:20:53,679 --> 01:20:56,960
lazy

2308
01:20:54,719 --> 01:20:58,399
with the f5 project people can look

2309
01:20:56,960 --> 01:21:00,639
forward to

2310
01:20:58,399 --> 01:21:01,599
which i think with the f4 is i kind of i

2311
01:21:00,639 --> 01:21:03,039
mean

2312
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:04,400
for the most part everything that i'm

2313
01:21:03,039 --> 01:21:07,119
seeing and hearing and everything that

2314
01:21:04,399 --> 01:21:09,759
we've seen all the blood structures just

2315
01:21:07,119 --> 01:21:12,079
the good size flower sets

2316
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:13,119
and nothing too crazy but i think if

2317
01:21:12,079 --> 01:21:14,800
anything

2318
01:21:13,119 --> 01:21:17,920
out of all of it is going to be getting

2319
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:20,719
some more maybe more uniform

2320
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:22,399
not so much of actual structure

2321
01:21:20,719 --> 01:21:25,279
but size

2322
01:21:22,399 --> 01:21:27,039
depending on the cross and or the

2323
01:21:25,279 --> 01:21:30,158
some could be more fox tailored than

2324
01:21:27,039 --> 01:21:32,000
others and vice versa so

2325
01:21:30,158 --> 01:21:34,079
good so we're starting to see a lot more

2326
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:36,319
uniformity in the population yeah i mean

2327
01:21:34,079 --> 01:21:38,319
a little bit more but then also

2328
01:21:36,319 --> 01:21:39,759
my biggest thing is to keep the terpene

2329
01:21:38,319 --> 01:21:42,639
profile

2330
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:43,840
open but yes yes

2331
01:21:42,639 --> 01:21:45,840
